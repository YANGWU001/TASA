While it attempts to connect to past struggles (percent-of, area), these references do not lead to adaptive scaffolding or tailored examples that noticeably improve comprehension; the student continues to show uncertainty throughout. Dialogue B uses more real-world scenarios (pizza, books, pencils) that can support conceptual understanding, but the explanations are often muddled, with repeated recaps of earlier examples rather than progressive skill-building, and some inaccuracies or unclear wording that could confuse the student. Both tutors are responsive to uncertainty, but neither shows clear evidence of improved student mastery or efficient progression\u2014the student remains unsure.

The questions are simpler and scaffolded more logically, which for a struggling student builds a more solid conceptual foundation. Although B\u2019s personalization is minimal, its explanations are less error-prone, more straightforward, and keep the student focused on fraction-multiplication mechanics.

It uses clear steps (divide numerator by denominator, multiply by 100) and re-exposes the student to the process multiple times with concrete examples. Its shorter feedback cycles and more procedural clarity provide a cleaner learning path. While neither shows clear mastery gains from the student and many answers are \"I don't know,\" B avoids tangents and keeps instruction simple and on-task, which for this student's low success rate is more conducive to incremental improvement.

It corrects mistakes by walking through step\u2011by\u2011step multiplication of a numerator and denominator, and repeats the correct method in several contexts.
