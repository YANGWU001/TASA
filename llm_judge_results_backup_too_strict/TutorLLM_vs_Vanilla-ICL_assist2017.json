While it frames feedback around student awareness and breaking problems into smaller steps, the personalization is generic \u2014 it does not explicitly leverage the student\u2019s profile weaknesses beyond situational encouragement. Dialogue B is more concise and direct: the tutor provides clear worked examples, reiterates the core two\u2011step procedure, and maintains steady practice with varied numbers. It avoids the excessive repetition seen in A and delivers concrete numeric solutions alongside prompts for the student to try steps themselves. However, B\u2019s instruction is more generic and doesn\u2019t adjust pedagogy based on the student profile either. Learning outcomes in both cases are similar: the student remains stuck, gets the same core method explained, and practices basic \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d mechanics.

Its instructional quality is adequate but pacing is poor and the student never produces a correct answer \u2014 learning outcome is minimal. Personalization is limited; despite the student\u2019s profile and past challenges, A uses only general strategies without tailoring examples to the student\u2019s strengths/weaknesses meaningfully.  \nDialogue B, while still largely generic in its approach, successfully scaffolds the evaluation process into explicit steps, and notably gets the student to solve \\(f(7)\\) correctly step\u2011by\u2011step. This is a clear evidence of better learning outcome \u2014 the student demonstrates skill application at least once \u2014 which outweighs the similar personalization level. Even though B repeats some corrections about the same example (g(-2)), it remains more task\u2011focused and yields a tangible success. Therefore, B produces measurably better learning for this concept.\n\n**Instructional Quality: A [5/10], B [7/10]**  \n**Personalization Impact: A [4/10], B [4/10]**  \n**Overall Score: A [5/10], B [6.5/10]**\n\n**Confidence: High**"

While it aims to personalize, the actual teaching steps toward the answer are delayed and sometimes buried under process talk, making progress slow for this straightforward skill. Dialogue B is more concise, keeps the focus tightly on the \u201csum\u2011of\u2011angles = 180\u00b0\u201d rule, and quickly cycles through examples with immediate application, catching arithmetic slips and reinforcing the core process (add then subtract). Although B has no explicit personalization to the student\u2019s profile, its tight structure and repetitive practice directly target the skill and lead to clearer procedural mastery. For this concept, the simpler, more direct approach yields noticeably better learning outcomes for the student.\n\n**Instructional Quality: A [6/10], B [8/10]**  \n**Personalization Impact: A [4/10], B [3/10]**  \n**Overall Score: A [5/10], B [7/10]**\n\n**Confidence: High**"
