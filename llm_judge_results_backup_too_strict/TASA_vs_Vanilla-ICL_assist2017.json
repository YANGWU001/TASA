In A, the tutor isolates the main source of student error (percent-to-decimal conversion) and repeatedly reinforces this step through targeted sub\u2011problems before reintroducing full two\u2011step calculations. Explanations are accurate, with step\u2011by\u2011step checks, explicit reasoning, and gradual difficulty progression. Dialogue B uses realistic discount scenarios and correct explanations, but it often restates similar percent-of-price problems without addressing the student's persistent conversion misunderstanding as directly or intensively as A does. Both show responsiveness to confusion, but A's repetition is purposeful, building the missing skill in smaller increments, whereas B's repetition is more situational without adapting pedagogy much to the student's profile weaknesses.

The pacing is gradual, with repeated, simpler numbers introduced to focus on process, which fosters learning retention.

Dialogue B is accurate and interactive, but feedback is shorter and mainly corrects arithmetic mistakes without as much structural reinforcement of the concept.
