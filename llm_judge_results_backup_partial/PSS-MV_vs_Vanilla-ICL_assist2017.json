While the student often responds with \"I don't know,\" the tutor in A uses these moments to reframe explanations and keep engagement high. Personalization is meaningfully applied: the tutor leverages the visual learning preference, offers concrete drawing tasks, and connects explanations to the student's strengths in algebraic manipulation by introducing midpoint formulas gradually.  \nDialogue B mainly offers repeated generic practice questions without adapting instructional strategies based on the student's difficulties; when the student says \"I don't know,\" the feedback tends to be boilerplate, with little scaffolding to bridge gaps.
