Personalization is more meaningful here because it selects appropriately challenging problems (ratios, multi-step solving) relevant to the student\u2019s needs rather than just generic missing-angle tasks. Dialogue B is interactive and keeps engagement up with repeated practice on basic subtraction from 180\u00b0, but it stays at a low difficulty level and does not progress beyond simple problems; this limits its instructional impact given the student is already engaging with the idea and could benefit from deeper application.
