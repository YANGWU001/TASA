The tutor explanations are verbose but repetitive, with little shift in method to improve the student's shaky arithmetic and step\u2011order confidence. In contrast, Dialogue B builds a *clear, consistent two\u2011step framework* for percentage discounts, reinforces it across varied examples, and introduces chunking techniques (10\u202f%\u202f+\u202f5\u202f%, 1\u202f% trick) to strengthen mental math. This scaffolding directly matches the student\u2019s tendency to mix up pieces of the calculation (seen in their history) and provides specific arithmetic shortcuts to reduce errors. While B is not overtly \u201cpersonalized\u201d via profile data, it adapts in real time to the student\u2019s work and misconceptions, making its personalization practical and effective. The teaching in B is more efficient, more procedural, and better aimed at building confidence, so it should produce better learning outcomes for this student.\n\n**Instructional Quality: A [5.5/10], B [8.5/10]**  \n**Personalization Impact: A [3/10], B [7.5/10]**  \n**Overall Score: A [4.5/10], B [8.2/10]**\n\n**Confidence: High**"
