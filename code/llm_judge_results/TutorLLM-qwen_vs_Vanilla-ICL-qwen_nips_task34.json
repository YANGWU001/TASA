Dialogue B, although less overtly personalized, delivers a cleaner, more focused instructional arc: it progressively moves the student from identifying the common difference, to applying the nth term formula, to simplifying it correctly (with an explicit correction of a concrete algebra mistake). This results in clearer feedback targeted to the specific work the student produced, which is likely to improve learning outcomes. B\u2019s explanations are concise, formula-driven, and responsive to the student\u2019s actual answers, whereas A often reiterates profile data without turning it into targeted instruction.
