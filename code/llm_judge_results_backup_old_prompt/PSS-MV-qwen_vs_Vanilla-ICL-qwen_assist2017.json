The tutor adapts to the student's known weaknesses in percents and discount by directly connecting concepts to real-life scenarios the student has experienced (tipping at a restaurant, shopping discounts), which aligns with the student's past struggle data in discounts. The tutor builds on the student's own strategies (splitting percentages into 10% parts) and praises them for using intuitive mental math, reinforcing confidence. When the student says \"I don't know,\" the tutor treats it as an important reflective moment and scaffolds the problem using familiar anchors, making the learning feel personally relevant. Dialogue B, while clear and step-by-step, remains largely generic: it uses typical percent problems and gives procedural hints without referencing the student's past records or preferred strategies.
