The tutor builds on the student's own analogies, praises their efforts, and scaffolds the slope concept gradually from positive to negative slopes, reflecting responsiveness to their uncertainties. Although the student struggles with related skills (\"Find Y@@@@ positive slope\" is at 29% accuracy), Dialogue A provides concrete examples and slower pacing, addressing gaps with tailored prompts. Dialogue B, in contrast, relies on repetitive linear equation coefficient identification without connecting to the student's previous difficulties or leveraging real-world contexts, leading to rote memorization attempts rather than conceptual understanding.
