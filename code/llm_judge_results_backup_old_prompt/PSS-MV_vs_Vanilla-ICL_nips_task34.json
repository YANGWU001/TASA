Although the conversation drifts into 3\u2011D graphics and light representation, this reflects an effort to anchor learning in something the student finds engaging. In contrast, Dialogue B remains narrowly focused on LCM problems and gives generic, procedural feedback without tailoring the approach to the student\u2019s repeated uncertainty or connecting to their interests or past record. B treats each \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d as incorrect without trying different methods for comprehension or engaging the student more meaningfully.
