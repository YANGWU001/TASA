For example, after the student says \"I don't know\" in an evaluating-functions problem, the tutor links the task to **area**, which is a topic the profile shows the student struggles with (35% accuracy over 23 attempts). This creates a contextual bridge to help the student connect the abstract skill to a concrete domain they need improvement in. Additionally, Dialogue A adapts feedback to the student\u2019s partial attempts, highlighting both correct reasoning and small missteps, and offers targeted tips like watching parentheses, which addresses mistakes the student has made before (e.g., reciprocal errors). In contrast, Dialogue B gives clear, step-by-step general explanations but does not reference the student\u2019s specific mastery data or past struggles meaningfully; all examples are generic scenario-based problems without tailoring to the profile (e.g., ignoring the student's weak topics like area, percents, or reciprocal). Thus, while both are responsive, only Dialogue A uses student-specific history and weaknesses to shape instruction.\n\n**Personalization Score A: 7/10**  \n**Personalization Score B: 3/10**\n\n**Confidence: High**"

The tutor not only addresses the target skill (\"sum-of-interior-angles-triangle\") but also explicitly scaffolds the learning process with multi-step strategies, reminders of related rules, and connections to other weak areas (e.g., tying problem setup skills to \u201corder-of-operations\u201d and \u201cmean\u201d which are also known gaps for this student). The feedback adapts to the student's repeated \"I don't know\" responses by breaking problems down into smaller chunks, encouraging self-explanation, sketches, and variable substitution \u2014 methods likely to help a student with low accuracy in geometry-related skills. In contrast, Dialogue B is almost entirely procedural and generic: it repeatedly restates the triangle-sum rule and walks through straightforward arithmetic without leveraging the student\u2019s profile or past mistakes. While Dialogue B offers correct step-by-step guidance, it doesn't integrate the student's broader learning history or strengths/weaknesses, nor does it vary the instructional approach to maintain engagement in the face of repeated uncertainty.\n\n**Personalization Score A: 8/10**  \n**Personalization Score B: 4/10**\n\n**Confidence: High**"

The tutor repeatedly breaks problems into smaller micro\u2011steps, offers targeted hints, and encourages metacognitive strategies like \u201cidentify the unknown,\u201d \u201crewrite the equation in words,\u201d and \u201clook for the simplest operation.\u201d This aligns with the student's profile showing major weaknesses in equation\u2011solving and related reasoning skills. While still fairly generic and not explicitly referencing the student\u2019s prior performance data, Dialogue A responds adaptively to the student's hesitations with variable supportive prompts, tables of common stumbling blocks, and repeated practice on similar equation forms. Dialogue B, in contrast, remains more generic\u2014it asks the student to translate word problems into equations without explicitly scaffolding based on the student\u2019s documented equation\u2011solving struggles, and often reiterates \u201cidentify the unknown\u201d without tailoring problem complexity or method to the student\u2019s difficulty. Neither dialogue leverages the student\u2019s complete learning history (weaknesses in pattern\u2011finding, probability, etc.), but A\u2019s responsiveness and gradual guidance give it a modest personalization edge.\n\n**Personalization Score A: 5/10**  \n**Personalization Score B: 3/10**\n\n**Confidence: High**"

It also makes small connections to related weak areas (e.g., comparing isolating a variable to finding a mean), which aligns with the student's documented struggles in both topics. While Dialogue B provides clear, structured word problems and explanations, it remains largely generic and does not connect explicitly to the student's known difficulties or past errors. Dialogue A more actively engages with the student's misconceptions (e.g., confusing constants with variable terms) and guides corrections over multiple exchanges. Dialogue B keeps repeating the same generic word-problem-to-equation process without substantial adaptation to the student's repeated mistakes or learning profile.\n\n**Personalization Score A: 6/10**  \n**Personalization Score B: 4/10**\n\n**Confidence: High**"
