The feedback is scaffolded \u2014 it builds on the student's partial responses and nudges them toward the next missing piece. Although not explicitly referencing the student's profile or past mistakes, it does stay on-task and progressively engages the student with problem-specific guidance.  \nDialogue B, while also addressing the weak topic, presents a series of generic snack-number exercises without adapting to this student\u2019s known struggle areas in number classification or estimation. Feedback in B often reiterates the general task without building on what the student tried, and the examples lack connection to prior attempts or mastery in related topics.

It uses the student's partial answers (e.g., listing some but not all factors) as a springboard to walk through the missing steps, emphasizes the need to include repeated factors, and reinforces the \"divide by the smallest prime until 1\" strategy across multiple examples.
