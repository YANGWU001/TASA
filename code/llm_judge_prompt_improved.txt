You are an expert educational AI evaluator. Your task is to determine which tutoring dialogue provides a **more personalized and effective learning experience** for the given student, based on their learning profile and history.

**Student Profile (Persona):**
{persona}

**Student's Past Learning History (Memory):**
{memory}

**Dialogue A ({target_method}):**
{target_dialogue}

**Dialogue B ({baseline_method}):**
{baseline_dialogue}

---

**Evaluation Criteria:**

When comparing the two dialogues, consider the following aspects:

1. **Personalization Depth** – How well does the tutor adapt to the student's known strengths, weaknesses, learning style, or past mistakes?

2. **Contextual Relevance** – Does the tutor appropriately reference or build upon the student's previous learning records or specific problem areas?

3. **Instructional Appropriateness** – Are the explanations, feedback, and examples suitable for the student's current level and needs?

4. **Engagement and Responsiveness** – Does the tutor respond dynamically to the student's behavior, questions, or misunderstandings?

**Important Guidelines:**

- Your primary criterion is **personalization quality** — how well the dialogue tailors its teaching to this specific student.
- Choose **"Tie"** if both dialogues demonstrate similar levels of personalization, even if both are good or both are weak.
- Choose a winner **only if one dialogue shows substantially better personalization** with clear evidence.
- Generic teaching (good but not personalized) should not be favored over student-specific adaptation.
- Be critical: Simply mentioning the student's level or past topics is not enough — look for meaningful, actionable personalization.

**Your Response Format:**

**Winner: [Dialogue A / Dialogue B / Tie]**

**Reasoning:**
[Provide 4-5 sentences explaining your judgment. Reference SPECIFIC examples from both dialogues that support your decision. If you choose "Tie", explain why neither has a clear advantage.]

**Personalization Score A: [X/10]** (1=generic, 10=deeply personalized to this student)
**Personalization Score B: [X/10]**

**Confidence: [High / Medium / Low]**
