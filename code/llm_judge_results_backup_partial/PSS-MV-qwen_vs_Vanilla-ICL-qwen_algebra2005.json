This personalization is highly relevant given the student\u2019s needs improvement in \u201cUsing difficult numbers,\u201d as it builds number sense through meaningful associations rather than abstract drills. The tutor adapts organically to multiple \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d responses, slowing pace and reframing questions to align with observed learning style, which promotes engagement and gradual confidence-building. In contrast, Dialogue B maintains a narrow focus on procedural practice with difficult calculations but offers minimal adaptation to the student\u2019s repeated uncertainty, often simply restating the importance of attempting problems. Its personalization is generic and doesn\u2019t leverage the student\u2019s profile to craft contexts or scaffold entry points to problem-solving.
