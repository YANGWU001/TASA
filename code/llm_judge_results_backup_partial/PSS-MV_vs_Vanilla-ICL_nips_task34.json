The tutor breaks down each step, checks the student\u2019s understanding, and addresses confusion interactively, which is crucial for this learner profile.

Dialogue B, while mathematically correct, is highly repetitive and offers minimal scaffolding\u2014it repeatedly tells the student the correct formula without leading them through the reasoning process. It does not adapt its approach despite multiple \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d responses, which limits engagement and learning impact.

The personalization is more meaningful: the tutor adapts pace, explanation style, and question format in response to repeated \"I don't know\" answers, and connects directly to the student\u2011stated focus on Multiples and LCM, an area where the profile shows marked weakness (40% accuracy).

Dialogue B, while more on-topic for \u201cTime,\u201d follows a repetitive drill format with little variation in teaching strategies, and the handling of \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d responses is mainly reiterating the same backward calculation approach without deeper support or adaptation to known weaknesses.

Although it explains differences between area and volume well, it doesn\u2019t leverage the student\u2019s profile to adjust the approach, and tends to re-ask similar cube/area problems without breaking down the computation process as deeply.
