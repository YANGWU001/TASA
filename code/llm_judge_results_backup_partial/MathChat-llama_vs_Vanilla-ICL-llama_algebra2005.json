It gives step-by-step reasoning, attempts to connect the idea back to the problem at hand, and generally keeps the learning path somewhat focused despite digressions. Dialogue B, by contrast, frequently veers off-task, misaligns feedback with the actual context, and sometimes contradicts itself (e.g., marking incorrect answers as \u201ccorrect\u201d inconsistently). It does less to scaffold the student's understanding of the unit-identification concept, and personalization is superficial \u2014 it doesn't adapt explanations to the noted weak skill area.
