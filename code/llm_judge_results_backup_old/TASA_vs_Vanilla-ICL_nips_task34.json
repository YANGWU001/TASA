There is some adaptation to uncertainty (accepting \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d and explaining steps), but it does not systematically build the base concept of angle categories or ensure mastery at the current level.

While neither dialogue meaningfully leverages the student\u2019s detailed profile for personalization (both proceed generically), Dialogue A responds more effectively to the student\u2019s uncertainty with supportive breakdowns and targeted visual examples, rather than moving too quickly. Dialogue B, by contrast, cycles through disconnected multiple-choice questions with little coherence to progression, sometimes jumping in concept difficulty and occasionally rehashing prior questions without clear linkage. Engagement in B suffers because student confusion is met with generic restatements rather than guided correction, and instructional outcomes feel fragmented.
