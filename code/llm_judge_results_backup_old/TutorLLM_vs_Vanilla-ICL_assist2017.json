In A, the tutor breaks down the solution process step-by-step, checks the student's work, and offers hints that build from simpler proportion concepts toward equation setup, which is appropriate given the student\u2019s low equation-concept accuracy. Personalization is present but mild\u2014it references the student having done proportion problems before, which helps make a conceptual bridge.

Engagement is higher in A because the tutor actively acknowledges the small correct steps, encourages, and redirects, whereas B\u2019s repeated resets likely keep the student passive.

In contrast, Dialogue B gives correct explanations and uses worked examples, but personalization is generic\u2014it relies on standard hints without adapting to the student\u2019s documented habits or weaknesses.
