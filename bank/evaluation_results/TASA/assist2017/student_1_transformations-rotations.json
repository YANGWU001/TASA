      "student_answer": "When a point \\((x,\\;y)\\) is rotated **90\u00b0 clockwise** about the origin \\((0,0)\\), the coordinates swap places and the new\u202f\\(x\\)-coordinate takes the **negative** of the original\u202f\\(x\\).  \n\nThe transformation rule is  \n\n\\[\n(x,\\;y)\\;\\longrightarrow\\;(y,\\;-x).\n\\]\n\nSo every point of the shape is moved to a new position given by that formula. For example, the point \\((4,-1)\\) becomes \\((-1,-4)\\), and \\((2,3)\\) becomes \\((3,-2)\\). The whole figure is turned a quarter\u2011turn to the right while staying the same distance from the origin.",
