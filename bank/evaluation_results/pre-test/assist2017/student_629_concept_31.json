  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of transversals and their properties, but there are several misconceptions, particularly regarding angle relationships. The answers show confusion between corresponding, alternate interior, and exterior angles, and some answers lack accuracy in definitions and calculations. More clarity and confidence in the concepts are needed.",

      "question": "What is a transversal in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is a line that cuts across two other lines (or more) in a plane.\u202fIt\u2019s the line that goes through them, kind of like a \u201ccross\u2011over\u201d line.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I remember hearing that it often meets the other lines at right angles, especially when the other lines are parallel. (So \u2026 it\u2019s a line that intersects other lines, usually at a right angle.)"

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, how many angles are formed at the points of intersection?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think it makes **six angles** in total at the two intersection points."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Define the relationship between corresponding angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when a transversal crosses two parallel lines the\u202fcorresponding\u202fangles end up adding up to\u202f180\u202fdegrees, so they\u2019re supplementary rather than equal.  (I could be mixing things up.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think alternate interior angles are the ones that sit **inside** the two parallel lines **and are on the same side** of the transversal. So when the transversal cuts the lines, you just look at the two interior angles that are next to each other on that side\u2014that\u2019s the pair of alternate interior angles. I'm not totally sure, though."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal crossing two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the interior angles that show up when a transversal cuts two parallel lines add up to... maybe 180 degrees? I'm not totally sure, but that seems right."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think one place you can actually see transversals in real life is where a road crosses a set of railroad tracks. The tracks are a bunch of parallel lines, and the road that cuts across them acts like a transversal. (So the road makes those angle relationships with the tracks.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a transversal is just any line that crosses two other lines.\u202fWhen those two lines happen to be parallel, the transversal makes a bunch of angles at the intersection points.\n\nSo, I guess the idea is that the angles that are \u201con the same side\u201d of the transversal and between the parallel lines add up to 180\u00b0.\u202fThose are called consecutive\u2011interior (or co\u2011interior) angles, and they\u2019re supposed to be supplementary.\u202fFor example, if the transversal makes a 70\u00b0 angle on the top left, then the angle right below it on the same side of the transversal should be 110\u00b0 so they sum to 180\u00b0.\n\nI also remember something about the \u201calternate interior\u201d angles being supplementary, but maybe I\u2019m mixing that up\u2026 I think those are the ones that are opposite each other across the transversal, inside the parallel lines, and they also add up to 180\u00b0, right?\u202fAnd the corresponding angles (the ones in the same corner position at each intersection) are equal, so they\u2019re not supplementary.\n\nIn short, the transversal creates several angle pairs: the consecutive\u2011interior ones are supplementary (they add to 180\u00b0), the alternate interior ones are\u2026 I think they\u2019re also supplementary, and the corresponding ones are just equal.\u202fSo that\u2019s how you get pairs of supplementary angles when a transversal cuts parallel lines."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think alternate interior angles are the ones that lie **outside** the two parallel lines\u2014so they\u2019re on the outer side of the figure\u2014but they\u2019re on opposite sides of the transversal.  \n\nAnd, um, alternate **exterior** angles are the ones that are **inside** the parallel lines, also on opposite sides of the transversal.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I remember it."

      "question": "Solve for x: A transversal intersects two parallel lines, creating one angle measuring 70\u00b0. What is the measure of its corresponding angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the corresponding angle would be about **110\u00b0**."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think vertical angles are equal because they\u2019re kind of \u201cmirrored\u201d across the intersecting lines. When two lines cross, the opposite angles are made by the same two lines, so they end up having the same size. I guess it\u2019s something like the transversal creates two pairs of equal angles on each side, and the ones that are opposite each other just end up matching. Maybe it\u2019s because the intersecting lines force the angles to be complementary, so the opposite ones have to be the same. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
