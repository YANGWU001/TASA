      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an isosceles triangle is a triangle where all three sides are the same length, so it\u2019s kind of like an equilateral triangle.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "If two angles of a triangle are equal, can it be classified as an isosceles triangle? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think that just having two equal angles isn\u2019t enough to call a triangle isosceles.  An isosceles triangle is defined by having **two equal sides**, not by the angles.  So even if two angles happen to be the same, the sides opposite those angles could be different, and the triangle wouldn\u2019t be isosceles.  In other words, the classification depends on the side lengths, not the angle measures.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the two base angles of an isosceles triangle aren\u2019t equal \u2013 they might actually be supplementary to each other (adding up to 180\u00b0)."

      "question": "Draw an isosceles triangle and label its equal sides and angles. Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019ll try to sketch it in words.  \n\nI\u2019ll draw a triangle that looks a bit like a \u201cV\u201d with the point at the top.  \nSo I\u2019ll have a point\u202fA at the top, then two points\u202fB and\u202fC down at the bottom.  \nI\u2019ll connect A\u2011B, A\u2011C, and B\u2011C to make the triangle.\n\nNow, for an isosceles triangle the two sides that are the same length are\u2026 I think they\u2019re the ones that go from the top point down to the base, so I\u2019ll say side **AB** and side **BC** are equal. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)  \n\nBecause those sides are equal, the angles opposite them should be equal too. So the angles at points\u202fC and\u202fA would be the same. I\u2019ll label \u2220C\u202f=\u202f\u2220A.  \n\nAnd the third side, **AC**, is the \u201cdifferent\u201d side, so the angle at B is the odd one out. I\u2019ll call that angle \u2220B.  \n\nSo, in summary:  \n\n- Triangle\u202fABC with vertices A (top), B (bottom left), C (bottom right).  \n- Equal sides: **AB** = **BC** (the two sides that meet at B).  \n- Equal angles: \u2220A = \u2220C (the angles at the top and the bottom right).  \n- The remaining side **AC** is the base, and its opposite angle \u2220B is the non\u2011equal one.  \n\nI think that\u2019s how you\u2019d label an isosceles triangle, right? (I\u2019m not completely confident, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got.)"

      "question": "A triangle has sides of lengths 7 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm. Is this triangle isosceles? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not completely sure, but I think this triangle is **not** isosceles.  \nThe sides are 7\u202fcm, 7\u202fcm, and 10\u202fcm, and since the 10\u202fcm side is different from the other two, the triangle doesn\u2019t have the two equal sides that are required for an isosceles triangle. So, because only one pair of sides matches (the 7\u202fcm sides) and the third side is longer, I\u2019d say it isn\u2019t an isosceles triangle."

      "question": "Can an isosceles triangle also be a right triangle? Provide an example or counterexample.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t think an isosceles triangle can be a right triangle.  For example, if you have a triangle with two equal sides of length\u202f2 and the third side of length\u202f3, that\u2019s an isosceles triangle, but the sides don\u2019t satisfy the Pythagorean theorem, so it can\u2019t be a right triangle.  So, as far as I can tell, an isosceles triangle can\u2019t also be a right triangle."

      "question": "Describe how the symmetry of an isosceles triangle can help determine its properties.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the symmetry of an isosceles triangle is kind of\u2026 well, the triangle has a line of symmetry that goes through the vertex opposite the base, right? So maybe you can use that line to figure out a bunch of things.  \n\nFirst, because there\u2019s a mirror line, the two legs are the same length\u2014well, actually I guess that\u2019s what makes it isosceles, so the symmetry just confirms that. And then the angles at the base are also equal, which \u2026 yeah, that\u2019s another property you can get from the symmetry.  \n\nI guess you could also say the altitude from the top vertex down to the base is also a median and a perpendicular bisector because of the symmetry. So that means it splits the base into two equal parts and makes two right\u2011angled triangles.  \n\nMaybe you can even use the symmetry to find the area: you could drop that altitude, find the height, and then do (base \u00d7 height)/2. And if you know the side lengths, you could use the Pythagorean theorem on one of the right\u2011angled halves to get the height.  \n\nI\u2019m not entirely sure, but I think the symmetry basically tells you that the triangle is \u201cbalanced,\u201d so the two sides and the two base angles match, and the line of symmetry gives you the altitude, median, and perpendicular bisector all in one.  \n\nSo, um, that\u2019s how the symmetry helps you figure out the sides, angles, and some measurements."
