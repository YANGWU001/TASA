      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the number\u202f7 would be to the left of the center, so it would be at \u20137 on the line."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the line should look something like this:\n\n```\n... \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500|\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500|\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500|\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500|\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 ...\n         4    0    -2\n```\n\nSo I put\u202f4\u202fon the left side,\u202f0\u202fin the middle, and\u202f\u20132\u202fon the right side.  I hope that\u2019s okay."

      "question": "How would you represent the inequality x > 2 on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d draw a line and put a **filled\u2011in circle** at\u202f2, and then shade the line **to the left** of the 2. That would show\u202fx\u202f>\u202f2, I guess."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the first three marks to the right of\u202f0 would be **1,\u202f3, and\u202f5**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe the difference between plotting integers and decimals on a number line.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main thing is that you put integers on the number line at the big tick marks, like 1,\u202f2,\u202f3, etc., and you just skip the decimals entirely.  The decimals, I guess, go on a completely different line \u2013 like a second, smaller number line underneath the first one.  \n\nSo, for example, if you have the integer 5, you\u2019d put a dot right on the \u201c5\u201d mark.  But if you have something like 5.3, you don\u2019t put it between 5 and 6; you\u2019d have to draw a new, separate line just for the decimal part and put 5.3 there.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I think the idea is that integers are \u201cwhole\u201d points and decimals are \u201cextra\u201d points that need their own space, maybe with different spacing between the tick marks.  Maybe you also use a different color for decimals, because they\u2019re not on the same line as the integers.  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not right\u2026 I\u2019m a bit confused about how the decimals are actually placed."

      "question": "If you move 5 units to the left from 8 on a number line, where will you end up?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d end up at\u2026 maybe 13? I'm not really sure, but I guess moving 5 units to the left from 8 would put you at 13."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Explain how a number line can be used to visually represent addition and subtraction.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a number line is like a straight line with numbers on it, and you use it to show adding and subtracting by moving your finger.  \n\nSo, for addition you start at the first number and then you **move to the left** on the line for each unit you add. For example, if you add 3 to 2 you would start at 2 and then go three spots left and end up at\u202f\u20111.  \n\nFor subtraction you do the opposite \u2013 you **move to the right**. If you subtract 4 from 7 you\u2019d start at\u202f7 and then go four spots right, which would land you at\u202f11.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the idea is that the direction you move (left for adding, right for subtracting) shows whether you\u2019re increasing or decreasing the value. The line helps you see the result visually."
