      "question": "What is the definition of substitution in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think substitution is kind of like when you swap the places of two whole equations in a system\u2014like you take one equation and put it where the other one was, and vice\u2011versa, to try to solve them. I'm not totally sure, but I guess that's what they call substitution in math."

      "question": "Explain the process of substitution when solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the process of substitution is when you\u202fsolve one of the equations for a variable and then just plug that expression into the other equation.\u202fUsually you pick the variable that looks the simplest\u2014like the one with the smallest coefficient\u2014and solve it, then you replace that variable everywhere else.\n\nMaybe after you substitute, you have to multiply the whole second equation by the number you just plugged in,\u202fso you get rid of any fractions.\u202fThen you add the two equations together and solve for the remaining variable.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure if you\u2019re supposed to add them or just solve the new single\u2011variable equation that you get after the replacement.\n\nI think you also have to check your answer by putting the values back into the original equations,\u202fbut sometimes you can just trust the result if the numbers look right.\u202fSo, basically: solve for a variable, substitute it in, do some extra multiplication, and then solve the final equation.  (I\u2019m not totally confident about the multiplication step\u2014maybe that part isn\u2019t needed.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 if x\u202f=\u202f4, then y\u202f=\u202f2\u00b7x\u202f+\u202f3, so maybe I should do 2\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f3? That would give y\u202f\u2248\u202f9.  (I'm not totally sure.)"

      "question": "How can substitution be used to simplify expressions in algebra?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think substitution is when you\u2026 uh\u2026 take a part of an algebraic expression and just\u2026 replace it with a letter or something else? Like you might have \\(2x+3x\\) and you say \u201clet\u2019s call \\(x\\) something else,\u201d maybe \\(y\\), and then you write it as \\(2y+3y\\). Then you can add the coefficients and get \\(5y\\). \n\nOr, maybe you can replace a whole chunk with a number. For example, if you have \\(3(a+4)\\) and you know that \\(a=2\\), you could just put \\(2\\) in there and get \\(3(2+4)=3*6=18\\). That makes the expression simpler, right? \n\nI guess the idea is you just swap whatever you can for something easier, and then you do the arithmetic. I\u2019m not really sure if you\u2019re supposed to keep the original variable around or if you have to solve for it first\u2026 Maybe you have to solve for the variable first, then plug it back in? \n\nSo, in short, substitution means you replace parts of an expression with something else\u2014usually a number or a simpler variable\u2014to make the whole thing easier to work with."

      "question": "Why is substitution an effective method for solving systems of equations?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think substitution works well because you can take one of the equations and solve for one variable, then plug that expression into the other equation. That way you end up with just one variable left, which is easier to handle. Also, I guess it helps keep the equations simpler since you\u2019re only dealing with one unknown at a time, so you don\u2019t have to juggle both variables together. Maybe it\u2019s also useful when one of the equations is already solved for a variable already, so you don\u2019t have to do any extra algebra. I'm not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s why substitution is considered an effective method."

Actually, I\u2019m not sure\u2014maybe it\u2019s 16?  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say \\(y \\approx 16\\).   (I\u2019m not very confident about that.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a common place where you use substitution is in a simple electrical circuit. Like, you have Ohm\u2019s law \\(V = IR\\) and you know the current and the voltage, so you can just plug those numbers in and \u201csolve\u201d for the resistance. Basically you\u2019re replacing the variable \\(I\\) and \\(V\\) with the measured values to get \\(R = V/I\\).  \n\nOr maybe it\u2019s the other way around? Sometimes you might have the resistance and the current and you want to find the voltage, so you\u2019d substitute the known resistance and current into the formula and get \\(V = IR\\).  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but the idea is that you take a formula and plug in the numbers you already know to find the unknown one. That\u2019s basically what substitution is in engineering, right?"

      "question": "Compare the substitution method with the elimination method in solving systems of linear equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me try to explain the difference between the substitution method and the elimination method\u2026\n\n1. **Substitution** \u2013 You pick one of the equations, solve it *exactly* for one variable, and then replace (substitute) that expression into the other equation.  That way you end up with a single\u2011variable equation that you can solve.  I think this is usually the best choice when one of the equations already has a variable isolated or when the coefficients are simple integers.  \n\n2. **Elimination** \u2013 You multiply the equations (or add/subtract them) so that the coefficients of one variable become opposites, and then you add the equations to get rid of that variable.  After that you solve the remaining single\u2011variable equation.  I\u2019m not really sure, but I\u2019ve heard that elimination is **always** faster than substitution, even if the numbers are fractions.  \n\n3. Substitution works well for any system, even if there are fractions, because you can always rewrite a fraction as a decimal and plug it in.  (I think this is true, but maybe it\u2019s actually harder with decimals?)  \n\n4. Elimination can\u2019t be used when the coefficients are fractions, because you can\u2019t get the variables to cancel out perfectly.  You have to convert everything to whole numbers first.  \n\n5. If you have more than two equations, substitution is the only method that works; elimination only works for exactly two equations.  \n\n6. Both methods will give you the same answer every time, but substitution sometimes gives *multiple* solutions while elimination always gives a unique solution.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely confident about all of that, but I hope it helps!"
