      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think n\u2011number sense is about using simple, \u201cbig\u2011picture\u201d numbers to get a quick feel for a calculation. So, for 987\u202f+\u202f654 you could round each number to a round hundred that\u2019s easy to work with. I\u2019d probably round 987 down to 900 and 654 down to 600, then just add those:  \n\n\\(900 + 600 = 1500\\).\n\nThat gives you a rough estimate that the real sum is somewhere around fifteen\u2011hundred. (You could then adjust a little if you wanted, but the basic idea is that using those rounded numbers lets you estimate the total quickly.)"

      "question": "If you divide 72 by 8, what is the quotient? Show your steps using n-number sense.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the quotient is **8**.\n\n**My steps (maybe I\u2019m mixing something up):**\n\n1. I know that dividing means seeing how many times the divisor (8) fits into the dividend (72).\n2. I try to break 72 into easy chunks that are multiples of 8.  \n   - 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f40  \n   - 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f16  \n   - 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f=\u202f8\n3. Adding those products: 40\u202f+\u202f16\u202f+\u202f8\u202f=\u202f64. That\u2019s close to 72, but I think I can still add another 8 to get 72.  \n   - 64\u202f+\u202f8\u202f=\u202f72\n4. So I counted 5\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9, but I\u2019m getting confused because I think I might have counted one extra 8.  \n5. If I *don\u2019t* count that extra one, I\u2019d have 5\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f8.\n\nSo, I\u2019m guessing the answer is **8**. (Sorry if I\u2019m off\u2014I\u2019m still figuring out the best way to break it down.)"

      "question": "How does understanding n-number sense help in simplifying complex calculations?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think understanding n\u2011number sense is kind of like having a feel for how numbers behave, so you can sort of \u201cguess\u201d the right steps when a problem looks messy.  \n\nWhen you\u2019re comfortable with things like the size of numbers, basic relationships (like how adding or subtracting certain values changes the magnitude), and maybe some quick mental tricks, you don\u2019t have to write out every single step. For example, if you see a huge product you might notice that both factors are multiples of 10, so you can pull those 10s out and do a simpler multiplication first.  \n\nAlso, if you understand patterns\u2014like how powers of a number grow, or how fractions simplify\u2014you can often cancel things early instead of carrying big numbers all the way through. That way the calculation stays smaller and you\u2019re less likely to make a slip\u2011up.  \n\nSo, yeah, basically n\u2011number sense gives you a mental shortcut toolbox that lets you break a complicated calculation into easier pieces, which makes the whole thing less intimidating and reduces the chance of errors. (I\u2019m not totally sure if I\u2019m describing it correctly, but that\u2019s what I think.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019d say the product of 49 and 6 is about **250**.  \n\nI figured it by thinking of 49 as \u201croughly 45\u201d (since 45 is a multiple of 5 that\u2019s easy to work with) and then multiplying 45\u202f\u00d7\u202f6 = 270. Then I just kind of rounded it down a bit because 49 is a little less than 50, so I guessed something in the mid\u2011200s \u2013 I went with 250 as a quick estimate.  \n\n(So, yeah, that\u2019s my best guess.)"

      "question": "Which is greater: the sum of 234 and 567 or the product of 23 and 45? Justify your answer using n-number sense.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of 234 and 567 is actually bigger than the product of 23 and 45.\n\nMy reasoning (though I\u2019m not totally confident) is that when you add 234\u202f+\u202f567 you get something close to 800 (actually 234\u202f+\u202f500\u202f=\u202f734 and then add the remaining 67 to get about 801). That feels like a pretty big number.\n\nFor the product, 23\u202f\u00d7\u202f45, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m doing the multiplication right, but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s somewhere around 600 or maybe a little over 600. I tried thinking of it as 20\u202f\u00d7\u202f45\u202f=\u202f900 and then subtracting a bit because the 3 extra in 23 would add only a small amount, so I guessed it ends up being less than the sum.\n\nSo, based on that quick \u201cnumber\u2011sense\u201d check, the sum (about 800) seems larger than the product (roughly 600\u2011plus). \n\n*I could be wrong, but that\u2019s how it looks to me.*"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a real\u2011life example of using n\u2011number sense operations might be something like figuring out how many miles you can drive on a tank of gas.\u202fYou\u2019d take the number of gallons in the tank, multiply by the car\u2019s miles\u2011per\u2011gallon rating, maybe adjust for traffic, and then you get an estimate of the distance you can travel.\u202fSo you\u2019re basically using the \u201cn\u2011number\u201d operations (like multiplying and adjusting) to make that guess."
