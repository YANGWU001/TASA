  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of congruence, but there are several misconceptions, particularly regarding the definitions and properties of congruent shapes. Answers to questions about congruence criteria and the differences between congruence and similarity show some understanding, but others reveal confusion, especially in the context of triangles and rectangles. Overall, the student shows potential but needs to clarify and strengthen their understanding of key concepts.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two shapes are congruent when they have the same size\u202f\u2014\u202flike the same area and perimeter\u2014but they don\u2019t have to look exactly the same. So if you can cut one shape and rearrange it without stretching to get the other, they\u2019re congruent. I'm not totally sure, though."

      "question": "If two triangles are congruent, what can you say about their corresponding sides and angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if two triangles are congruent, their matching sides are the same length, but the angles don\u2019t have to be exactly the same\u2014they\u2019re just similar. So the sides are equal, but the corresponding angles might only add up to the same total (like 180\u00b0) rather than being equal one\u2011for\u2011one. I\u2019m not totally sure, though."

      "question": "Explain how you can use transformations to determine if two figures are congruent.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can use the basic rigid motions \u2013\u202ftranslations, rotations, reflections (and even glide\u2011reflections) \u2013\u202fto see if two shapes are congruent.  The idea is that you try to move one figure around with those transformations until it lines up exactly with the other one.  If you can do that without changing the size or shape, then the figures are congruent.  So you\u2019d check things like \u201ccan I slide it over (translate) and then turn it (rotate) or flip it (reflect) so every point matches the other figure?\u201d  If the side lengths and angles end up the same after the moves, they\u2019re congruent.  I\u2019m not really sure if you ever need a dilation \u2013\u202fthat would change the size, so I guess it\u2019s not used for congruence.  Anyway, basically you just keep applying those rigid transformations until the two figures match."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Which congruence criteria can be used to prove that two triangles are congruent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the usual ones are the side\u2011side\u2011side (SSS) rule, side\u2011angle\u2011side (SAS) and angle\u2011side\u2011angle (ASA).  I also remember something about angle\u2011angle\u2011side (AAS) being okay, and for right triangles there\u2019s the hypotenuse\u2011leg (HL) or RHS criterion.  I'm not totally sure if I\u2019m missing any, but those are the ones I\u2019ve heard of."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Are two rectangles with the same area always congruent? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two rectangles that have the same area are actually congruent. If the area is the same, then the lengths of the sides have to be the same, right? Like if one rectangle is 4\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202fcm, its area is 20\u202fcm\u00b2, so any other rectangle with area 20\u202fcm\u00b2 would also have to be 4\u202fcm by 5\u202fcm, otherwise the area wouldn\u2019t match. So they end up having the same side lengths and are congruent. \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that's what it seems like to me.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think a place where congruence might matter is in cooking\u2014like when you\u2019re cutting vegetables into identical shapes so they all cook at the same rate. If the pieces are \u201ccongruent,\u201d they\u2019ll fit together nicely in the pan and heat evenly. (I'm not totally sure, but that seems like a real\u2011world use.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How does the concept of congruence differ from the concept of similarity in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think congruence means the two figures are exactly the same size **and** shape, so all of their corresponding sides and angles match perfectly.  \n\nSimilarity, on the other hand, is when the figures have the same shape but they don\u2019t have to be the same size \u2013 the angles are equal and the side lengths are just proportional.  \n\n...but I\u2019m not totally sure about the side\u2011length part for similarity. Maybe similarity also needs the side lengths to be equal?  I think that\u2019s probably wrong, though.  (I\u2019m a bit confused.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Using the SSS (Side-Side-Side) criterion, explain how you can prove two triangles are congruent.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 so the SSS thing is when you have two triangles and you\u2026 I think you check three sides. If the three sides of one triangle are the same length as the three sides of the other triangle, then the triangles are\u2026 uh, congruent.  \n\nSo, like, you just line up the sides: side\u202fA with side\u202fA, side\u202fB with side\u202fB, and side\u202fC with side\u202fC. If those three pairs match, then the triangles have to be the same shape and size.  \n\nI guess you also have to make sure the angles match, but I\u2019m not really sure how that works. Maybe if the sides are equal, the angles automatically become equal, right? So you don\u2019t need to check any angles at all \u2013 the side lengths alone are enough.  \n\nIn other words, you just measure all three sides of each triangle, compare them, and if they\u2019re all equal, you can say the triangles are congruent by the SSS criterion. That's all\u2026 I think."

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that if the triangles are congruent then the side AB might actually be longer than DE\u2014not exactly the same length.  (I could be wrong.)"

      "question": "Describe a step-by-step method to determine if two polygons are congruent.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way to check if two polygons are congruent goes something like this:\n\n1. **Count the sides.**  \n   First make sure the two polygons have the same number of sides. If one is a pentagon and the other is a hexagon, they can\u2019t be congruent.\n\n2. **Compare the perimeters.**  \n   Add up all the side lengths of each polygon and see if the totals are the same. If the perimeters match, that\u2019s a good sign they might be congruent. *(Actually this isn\u2019t enough, but I think it\u2019s a step people use.)*\n\n3. **Match the side lengths one\u2011by\u2011one.**  \n   List the side lengths of the first polygon in order, then try to line them up with the side lengths of the second polygon. If you can pair each side with a side of the same length, go to the next step.\n\n4. **Check the interior angles.**  \n   Measure each interior angle of the first polygon and see if the second polygon has the same set of angles (in the same order). If they do, the shapes should be congruent.\n\n5. **Look for a rigid motion.**  \n   Try to imagine sliding, rotating, or reflecting one polygon so that its vertices line up exactly with the vertices of the other. If you can do this without stretching or distorting any sides, the polygons are congruent.\n\n6. **Verify the orientation.**  \n   Make sure the order of vertices (clockwise vs. counter\u2011clockwise) is the same after you line them up. If the orientation is reversed, you might need a reflection.\n\n7. **Confirm with a diagram.**  \n   Draw both polygons on the same piece of paper, superimpose them, and see if they completely overlap. If they do, you\u2019ve proved congruence.\n\nIf any of these steps fails \u2013 different number of sides, mismatched side lengths, different angles, or you can\u2019t line them up with a rigid motion \u2013 then the polygons are **not** congruent."
