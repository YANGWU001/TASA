      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the student is actually correct.\u202fBoth numbers are kind of the same size, so they\u2019re equivalent.\u202fFor example, 0.2 can be written as the fraction 2\u204410, and if you simplify that you get 1\u20445.\u202fAnd 1\u20444 is also\u2026 well, if you write it as a decimal it\u2019s 0.25, but you can think of it as 2\u20448, which also simplifies down to 1\u20445.\u202fSo basically both 0.2 and \u00bc end up as 1\u20445, which means they\u2019re the same value.\u202fThat\u2019s why they\u2019re equivalent."
