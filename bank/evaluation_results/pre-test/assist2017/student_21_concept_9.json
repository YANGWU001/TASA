Like if the two sides are equal, the two opposite angles together make 90\u00b0, so each one would be 45\u00b0 if the triangle is isosceles. I'm not totally sure, but I think that's how they\u2019re related\u2014like they\u2019re complementary or something rather than equal."

Then the two equal sides are the slanted ones, and I\u2019m making each of those **5\u202fcm** long (again, I think I reversed the numbers).\n\nFor the angles, I\u2019m guessing the two base angles are each about **45\u00b0**, and the vertex angle at the top is about **90\u00b0**. I\u2019d label the sides like this:\n\n- Bottom side (base): 7\u202fcm  \n- Left side: 5\u202fcm  \n- Right side: 5\u202fcm  \n\nAnd the angles:\n\n- \u2220A (left base angle): 45\u00b0  \n- \u2220B (right base angle): 45\u00b0  \n- \u2220C (top vertex angle): 90\u00b0  \n\nSorry if this isn\u2019t exactly right \u2013 I\u2019m a bit confused about which side is which and the exact angle measures."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think this triangle isn\u2019t isosceles.  Since the angles are 50\u00b0,\u202f50\u00b0, and 80\u00b0, the only way a triangle is isosceles is if *all three* angles are the same, right?  Because we have two 50\u00b0 angles and one 80\u00b0 angle, the sides can\u2019t be equal, so the triangle must be scalene, not isosceles.  (I guess the different angle means all sides are different.)"

Since the two equal sides are 13\u202fcm each, I treated the whole base (10\u202fcm) as the other leg of the right\u2011triangle, so  \n\n\\[\nh = \\sqrt{13^{2} - 10^{2}} = \\sqrt{169 - 100} = \\sqrt{69} \\approx 8.3\\text{\u202fcm}.\n\\]\n\nSo the height should be roughly 8.3\u202fcm.

      "student_answer": "Um, I think an isosceles triangle is the one where **all three sides are equal**, kind of like a regular triangle, while an equilateral triangle only has **two sides that are the same length** and the third side is different.  So the main difference is that the isosceles has three equal sides and the equilateral has just two equal sides."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the proof goes something like this, although I\u2019m not totally sure if every step is right.\n\nLet\u2019s call the isosceles triangle \\( \\triangle ABC\\) with \\(AB = AC\\) and base \\(BC\\).  \nLet \\(M\\) be the midpoint of the base \\(BC\\). We want to show that the segment \\(AM\\) is perpendicular to \\(BC\\).\n\n1. Because the triangle is isosceles, the base angles are equal, so \\(\\angle ABC = \\angle ACB\\).\n\n2. Since \\(M\\) is the midpoint of \\(BC\\), we have \\(BM = MC\\).\n\n3. I think we can now say that triangles \\( \\triangle ABM\\) and \\(\\triangle ACM\\) are congruent.  \n   - They share side \\(AM\\).  \n   - We have \\(AB = AC\\) (given).  \n   - And \\(BM = MC\\) (midpoint).  \n   So by SSS, the two triangles are congruent.\n\n4. Because the two triangles are congruent, their corresponding angles are equal, so \\(\\angle AMB = \\angle AMC\\).\n\n5. But the angles \\(\\angle AMB\\) and \\(\\angle AMC\\) together make up the straight angle along line \\(BC\\), which is \\(180^\\circ\\). Since they\u2019re equal, each must be \\(90^\\circ\\).\n\n6. Therefore \\(\\angle AMB = 90^\\circ\\), meaning \\(AM\\) is perpendicular to \\(BC\\).\n\nThat\u2019s the whole proof, I guess. (I\u2019m not totally sure about the congruence part \u2013 maybe we needed a different criterion, but I think SSS works because we have \\(AB = AC\\), \\(BM = MC\\), and the common side \\(AM\\).)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one thing that looks like an isosceles triangle is a **traffic stop sign** \u2013 you know, the big red octagon that\u2019s kind of pointed at the top.  \nI guess the two longer sides of the \u201ctriangle\u201d are the parts that go up the pole, and the short base is the part that sits on the road.  \n\nThe significance, I guess, is that the shape is meant to catch drivers\u2019 attention and tell them to **stop** so they don\u2019t crash into the sign. It\u2019s kind of like how an isosceles triangle has two equal sides that give it stability, so the sign stays upright even in the wind.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe that\u2019s why engineers pick that shape for safety\u2011related signs."
