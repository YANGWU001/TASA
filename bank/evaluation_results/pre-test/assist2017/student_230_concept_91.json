  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the area of a circle, particularly in explaining the squaring of the radius and comparing areas. However, there are significant misconceptions in the formula for area, the effects of changing the radius, and calculations involving diameter and radius. More practice is needed to solidify these concepts.",

      "student_answer": "Um... I think the area of a circle is given by  \n\n**A = 2\u202f\u03c0\u202fr**  \n\n(so you multiply the radius by 2\u03c0)."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area is\u2026 maybe we just multiply the radius by \u03c0, so\u2026\n\n\\( \\text{Area} \\approx 3.14 \\times 7 = 21.98 \\text{ cm}^2 \\).\n\nI'm not totally sure, though."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain why the radius is squared in the formula for the area of a circle.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the radius is squared in the area formula is because you\u2019re basically counting the radius twice\u2014once for each direction across the circle. Like, when you\u2019re measuring an area you need two lengths, so you just take the radius and multiply it by itself, giving you r\u202f\u00d7\u202fr, and then you multiply by \u03c0 to scale it up. So the \u201csquaring\u201d just comes from using the radius as both the horizontal and vertical measure of the area. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "How does doubling the radius of a circle affect its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if you double the radius, the area just gets twice as big. So the new area would be about double the original area. (I'm not 100\u202f% sure.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you\u2019d do something like\u202fr\u202f=\u202f\u221a(area\u202f\u00f7\u202f\u03c0).  If I plug in 314\u202f\u00f7\u202f3.14 I get about\u202f100, and the square root of that is\u2026 maybe around\u202f5\u202fcm?  So I guess the radius is roughly\u202f5\u202fcm."

I think the area of the circle with radius\u202f5\u202fcm is about  \n\n\\[\nA_1 \\approx \\pi \\times 5^2 \\approx 25\\pi \\approx 78.5\\text{ cm}^2 .\n\\]\n\nAnd for the circle with radius\u202f10\u202fcm, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s roughly  \n\n\\[\nA_2 \\approx \\pi \\times 10^2 \\approx 100\\pi \\approx 157\\text{ cm}^2 .\n\\]\n\nSo, the larger circle\u2019s area is about twice the area of the smaller one.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think we need to use the formula \\(A = \\pi r^{2}\\). So \\(r^{2} = \\frac{A}{\\pi} = \\frac{50}{3.14}\\). That comes out to something like\u2026 maybe about 8 or 9? If I take the square\u202froot of that, I\u2019d get roughly **5.6\u202fm** for the radius. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"
