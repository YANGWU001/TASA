      "student_answer": "Um, I think an equation is basically just a math problem where you have to find the value of some unknown\u202f\u2014\u202flike solving for\u202fx. It\u2019s kind of a \u201cfind\u2011the\u2011number\u201d question rather than a formal statement that two expressions are equal."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think an expression is actually the thing that has the equals sign\u2014like\u202f\\(2+3=5\\)\u202fis an expression\u2014whereas an equation is just a combination of numbers and variables without any \u201c=\u201d in it, like\u202f\\(2+3\\). So basically expressions say that something is equal, and equations are just plain sums or products that you can simplify."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole idea of balancing both sides of an equation is\u2026 kind of like making sure the two sides are equal, so the equation stays true.\u202fWhen you do something to one side\u2014like add or subtract a number\u2014you have to do the same thing to the other side, otherwise you\u2019d change the value of the expression.\u202fSo, I guess it\u2019s mostly to keep the equation \u201cbalanced\u201d and let you solve for the unknown.  \n\n\u2026maybe it also helps you see which side is bigger?\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I think the main point is just to keep the equality correct while you\u2019re manipulating it."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a simple real\u2011life situation could be something like this: you have a group of friends and each friend gives you $2, and you want to know how much money you\u2019ll have in total. So I\u2019d write it as  \n\n\\[\n\\text{total money} = 5 + 2 = 7\\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nwhere the \u201c5\u201d is the number of friends and the \u201c2\u201d is the amount each friend gives. I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s the right way to set it up, but it seems like an everyday example that can be shown with an equation."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it means that the equation actually has *infinitely many* solutions, like it works for any value you plug in, so there isn\u2019t just one specific answer. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about \u201cno solution.\u201d"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell if a solution works for an equation by, like, plugging it in and seeing if the two sides are\u2026 equal? Sometimes you might also have to do a little rearranging first, like move all the terms to one side and then see if it comes out to zero. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe if the left\u2011hand side ends up being bigger than the right\u2011hand side it still counts? Or maybe you have to check the derivative of both sides? Honestly, I think the main idea is just to substitute the proposed solution back into the original equation and see if it makes sense, but I could be mixing things up."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole idea of inverse operations is that they let you \u201cundo\u201d what you\u2019ve done to a variable so you can isolate it.  For example, if you add 5 to\u202fx, you would subtract 5 on the other side to cancel it out.  Likewise, if you multiply x by 3, you\u2019d divide by 3 to reverse it.  \n\nI guess the reason we use them is because equations stay balanced\u2014whatever you do to one side you have to do an opposite (inverse) thing to the other side so the equality still holds.  So basically you keep applying the opposite operation until the variable is alone.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s why inverse operations are important in solving equations."
