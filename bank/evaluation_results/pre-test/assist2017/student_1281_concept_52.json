  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the order of operations, correctly identifying the steps and rationale in most cases. However, there were errors in calculations for questions 2, 5, and 8, indicating a need for careful arithmetic checks. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the concepts involved.",

      "question": "Explain why parentheses are used in mathematical expressions when applying the order of operations.",
      "student_answer": "Parentheses (\u202f( )\u202f) are a way of **grouping parts of a mathematical expression** so that the operations inside the group are carried out before any operations outside the group.  \n\nWhen we follow the standard order\u2011of\u2011operations rules (often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS/BODMAS), the sequence is:\n\n1. **Parentheses** (or other grouping symbols such as brackets\u202f[\u202f]\u202fand braces\u202f{\u202f})  \n2. Exponents / powers  \n3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)  \n4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)\n\nBecause parentheses are evaluated first, they let us **override the default precedence** and make the intended calculation unambiguous. For example:\n\n- Without parentheses:\u202f\\(3 + 4 \\times 2 = 3 + 8 = 11\\) (multiplication happens before addition).  \n- With parentheses:\u202f\\((3 + 4) \\times 2 = 7 \\times 2 = 14\\) (the addition inside the parentheses is forced to happen first).\n\nIn more complex expressions, multiple levels of parentheses can be nested to indicate successive layers of grouping, each of which is resolved from the innermost pair outward. This systematic use of parentheses ensures that everyone reading the expression interprets it the same way, avoiding ambiguity and mistakes."
