      "question": "Explain the difference between theoretical probability and experimental probability.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two are kind of the opposite of what you usually hear.\u202fTheoretical probability is what you get **by actually doing the experiment** and counting how often the event occurs, like tossing a coin a bunch of times and seeing the fraction of heads.\u202fExperimental probability, on the other hand, is the **formula\u2011based** one you calculate from the total number of possible outcomes (like saying a fair die has a 1/6 chance of any face).  \n\nSo basically, theoretical is the \u201creal\u2011world\u201d count from trials, and experimental is the \u201cideal\u201d math prediction. (I\u2019m not totally sure which is which, but that\u2019s how I remember it.)"

      "question": "What is the probability of drawing a red card from a standard deck of cards?",

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Describe the concept of mutually exclusive events and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think mutually exclusive events are events that **have to** happen together\u2026 like, if one happens the other automatically happens too.  In other words, they\u2019re kind of linked so that the probability of both of them is just the product of their separate probabilities.  \n\nFor example, if you roll a die, getting a 2 and getting an even number are mutually exclusive, because whenever you get a 2 you also get an even number, right?  So the probability of \u201c2 or even\u201d would be the sum of the two probabilities, which I guess would be 1/6\u202f+\u202f1/2\u202f=\u202f2/3.  \n\nSo basically, mutually exclusive events are events that always occur together and you just add their probabilities."

      "question": "How can you calculate the probability of two independent events occurring together?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you just add the probabilities of the two independent events together. So if\u202fP(A)\u202fis, say,\u202f0.3\u202fand\u202fP(B)\u202fis\u202f0.5, you\u2019d get\u202f0.3\u202f+\u202f0.5\u202f=\u202f0.8\u202fas the probability that both happen.
