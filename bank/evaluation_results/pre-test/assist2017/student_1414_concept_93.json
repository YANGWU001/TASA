Maybe you multiply the distance by the rate? So I guess time\u202f=\u202fdistance\u202f\u00d7\u202frate. \n\nI\u2019m not confident about that\u2014maybe it\u2019s the other way around, but that\u2019s what I remember."

So for 10\u202fmiles at 2\u202fmph you\u2019d do:\n\n\\(10 \\times 2 = 20\\)\n\nSo\u2026 maybe it would take about **20\u202fhours** to walk that far.

      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where understanding the relationship between rate, distance, and time is useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, I\u2019ll try to think of an example\u2026  \n\nOne situation where you might need to know how rate, distance, and time are related is when you\u2019re planning a road trip.  Let\u2019s say you want to drive from City\u202fA to City\u202fB, which is, I think, about 300\u202fmiles away.  If you think you can keep an average speed of, uh, 60\u202fmiles per hour, you could figure out how long the trip will take.  \n\nSo I\u2019d (incorrectly) use the formula **time = speed \u00f7 distance** \u2013\u2011\u2011 I guess that means 60\u202f\u00f7\u202f300, which would be\u2026 0.2 hours?  That sounds way too short, but maybe I\u2019m mixing things up.  Actually, the right way is probably **time = distance \u00f7 speed**, so it would be 300\u202f\u00f7\u202f60 = 5\u202fhours.  But I\u2019m not really sure which one is correct\u2026  \n\nAnyway, the idea is that if the traffic gets heavier and your average speed drops to, say, 30\u202fmph, you\u2019d have to recalculate.  Using the (maybe\u2011wrong) formula again, you\u2019d get 30\u202f\u00f7\u202f300 = 0.1 hours, which can\u2019t be right because it would be even shorter than before.  So you\u2019d have to think\u2026 maybe you should use distance \u00f7 speed again and get 300\u202f\u00f7\u202f30 = 10\u202fhours.  \n\nSo, in a real\u2011world road\u2011trip plan, you keep checking the relationship between how far you have to go, how fast you can go, and how long it will take.  If you get the formula mixed up, you could end up thinking the trip will take only a few minutes instead of several hours, which would be a big mistake when you\u2019re packing food and booking hotels.  \n\nI hope that makes some sense, even though I\u2019m still a bit fuzzy on the exact math."
