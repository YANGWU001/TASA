      "question": "What is the definition of proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a proportion is when two numbers are related by a constant factor\u2014like one thing is always a fixed multiple of the other.  So, for example, if\u202fy\u202fis always twice\u202fx, that\u2019s a proportion.  (I\u2019m not totally sure.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think we can solve it by cross\u2011multiplying.  \n\n\\( \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{x}{20} \\)\n\nSo \\(4 \\times 20 = 5 \\times x\\).\n\nThat gives \\(80 = 5x\\).\n\nDividing both sides by 5, we get \\(x = 16\\).\n\nSo, I believe the solution is **\\(x = 16\\)**."

      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think proportions are basically \u201cthe same\u2011ratio\u201d idea, so you can use them when you want to change a recipe size.  \n\nFor example, suppose a cake recipe is for **4 servings** and it calls for **2\u202fcups of flour**. If you want to make **6 servings**, you set up a proportion that links the original number of servings to the new number of servings, and the original amount of flour to the amount you need.  \n\nIt would look something like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{original servings}}{\\text{new servings}} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\text{original flour}}{\\text{new flour}} \n\\]\n\nSo you\u2019d write  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{6} \\;=\\; \\frac{2\\text{\u202fcups}}{x\\text{\u202fcups}} \n\\]\n\nThen you solve for \\(x\\).  Cross\u2011multiplying gives \\(4x = 6 \\times 2\\), so \\(x = \\frac{12}{4}=3\\)\u202fcups of flour.  \n\nThat means you\u2019d need **3\u202fcups** of flour for a 6\u2011serving cake. You\u2019d do the same thing for all the other ingredients\u2014just keep the same ratio of \u201coriginal amount\u202f:\u202fnew amount = original servings\u202f:\u202fnew servings.\u201d  \n\nIn general, the steps are:  \n\n1. Figure out the scaling factor (new servings \u00f7 original servings).  \n2. Multiply each ingredient quantity by that factor, or set up a proportion like the one above and solve it.  \n\nSo, basically, proportions let you keep the recipe\u2019s \u201cshape\u201d the same while changing its size.  \n\nI hope that makes sense\u2026 If I\u2019m mixing up the numerator/denominator, you can just flip the fraction and the calculation still works out the same way."

      "question": "If a car travels 60 miles in 2 hours, what is the proportional distance it would travel in 5 hours?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... the car goes 60 miles in 2 hours, so maybe that's like 30 miles per hour. If it keeps the same speed for 5 hours, I'd guess it would be around\u2026 uh, 30\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 = 150 miles. \n\nBut, uh, I'm not totally sure\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing something up. Could it be 120 miles instead? Honestly, I think the answer should be **150 miles**, but I might be wrong."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a ratio is just a way to compare two numbers, like\u202f3\u202fto\u202f4 or\u202f3:4, and a proportion is kind of the same thing but with three numbers instead of two? Like you write\u202f3\u202fto\u202f4\u202fto\u202f6\u202for something. So a ratio is a single comparison, and a proportion is\u2026 maybe when you have a bunch of ratios all lined up? I\u2019m not really sure."

      "question": "How can cross-multiplication be used to determine if two ratios form a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you use cross\u2011multiplication by just multiplying the two numerators together and the two denominators together, and then you see if those products are the same. So if you have the ratios \\(a/b\\) and \\(c/d\\), you\u2019d check whether \\(a \\times c = b \\times d\\). If those two products are equal, then the ratios form a proportion. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
