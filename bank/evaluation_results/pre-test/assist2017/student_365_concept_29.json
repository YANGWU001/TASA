  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of fraction multiplication, particularly in the process of multiplying and simplifying fractions. However, there are significant misconceptions, especially in simplification and the application of multiplication in real-world contexts.

      "student_answer": "Um, I think you multiply the numerators and the denominators:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{7} \\times \\frac{1}{3}= \\frac{6 \\times 1}{7 \\times 3}= \\frac{6}{21}.\n\\]\n\nThen you can simplify \\( \\frac{6}{21} \\) by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3, giving:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6 \\div 3}{21 \\div 3}= \\frac{2}{7}.\n\\]\n\nSo the resulting fraction is \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{2}{7}\\)."

      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together is because each fraction is like a \u201ctop\u2011part\u201d over a \u201cbottom\u2011part,\u201d and when you take a part of a part you just multiply the two \u201ctops\u201d to get the new top and the two \u201cbottoms\u201d to get the new bottom.  \n\nSo if you have \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\)\u202f\u00d7\u202f\\(\\frac{c}{d}\\), you do \\(a \\times c\\) for the new numerator and \\(b \\times d\\) for the new denominator.  That way the \u201csize\u201d of the piece (the numerator) and the size of the whole it\u2019s taken from (the denominator) are kept separate.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess it\u2019s because you\u2019re really just multiplying the two whole numbers that make up each fraction, and you have to keep the \u201ctop\u201d numbers together and the \u201cbottom\u201d numbers together so the fraction stays in the right form.  (\u2026maybe I\u2019m missing a step, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I\u2019ve got it.  \n\nFirst I multiply the numerators:\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f15.  \nThen I multiply the denominators:\u202f6\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f24.  \n\nSo I get\u202f15\u204424.  I tried to simplify it, and I think it comes out to\u202f5\u20446.  \n\nSo my answer is **5\u20446**.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 if the recipe needs\u202f2\u20443\u202fcup of sugar and you only want to make half of it, you\u2019d probably use\u2026 maybe half of\u202f2\u20443, which I guess is about\u202f1\u20444\u202fcup?  I'm not totally sure, but 1/4 cup sounds right."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the main difference is that when you **add** fractions you kind of **add the numerators and the denominators together**, while when you **multiply** fractions you just **multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators**. \n\nFor example, if you have \\( \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} \\), you would do something like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{2+1}{3+4} = \\frac{3}{7}.\n\\]\n\nBut if you multiply the same fractions, you would do  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{2 \\times 1}{3 \\times 4} = \\frac{2}{12} = \\frac{1}{6}.\n\\]\n\nSo basically, addition \u201cadds\u201d the parts of the fractions, and multiplication \u201cmultiplies\u201d them. (I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s exactly right, but that\u2019s the way I understand it.)"
