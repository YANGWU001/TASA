      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is\u2026 maybe 24 units? I'm not totally sure, but I got 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f+\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f16\u202f+\u202f6\u202f=\u202f22, and then I added the two results again by mistake, so I think it's 24."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think perimeter is kind of like the total distance around a shape. So you\u2026 you add up the lengths of all the sides to get the perimeter. I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is the sum of the three sides, so maybe\u202f5\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f10\u202f=\u202f23\u202fcm. \n\n(Not super sure though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter might be\u2026 maybe 8 meters? I'm not really sure, but I think you just add the two sides together, so 4\u202fm\u202f+\u202f4\u202fm = 8\u202fm."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of like the amount of space inside the shape, like how much \u201croom\u201d it has, and the area is the distance you\u2019d walk if you went all the way around the edges. So the perimeter is about the inside and the area is about the outside\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is probably 30\u202finches."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the width is 5\u202fcm, so the length would be twice that\u2026 maybe 10\u202fcm? Then the perimeter would be \u2026 I guess you add the sides together twice, so maybe it\u2019s something like\u202f20\u202fcm?  (I'm not totally sure.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is important because it tells you how much fence you\u2019ll need to go around the garden.\u202fThe perimeter is the total length of all four sides of the rectangle, so you add the two lengths and the two widths together and that gives you the amount of fencing material to buy.\u202fI guess it also helps you plan how the fence will fit the shape, but I\u2019m not really sure if there\u2019s anything else I\u2019m missing."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you\u2019d use the area formula for a circle, so the perimeter would be\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fr\u00b2.  In this case that would be \u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u00b2."

      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is the sum of all the sides... so maybe\u2026 3\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f5\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f4\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f6\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f2\u202fcm\u2026 that would be\u2026 18\u202fcm? I'm not totally sure, but I think the total perimeter is about 18\u202fcm."
