      "question": "What is the mathematical definition of pi?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u03c0 is defined as the ratio of a circle\u2019s **diameter** to its **circumference**.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."

      "question": "What is the approximate decimal value of pi to two decimal places?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it's around\u202f3.15\u202fto two decimal places. I'm not totally sure, but that's what I remember."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain why pi is considered an irrational number.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think pi is considered an irrational number because, well, its decimal goes on forever and it never repeats any pattern. Actually\u2026 maybe it\u2019s because you can write it as a fraction like 22/7, so it\u2019s rational? I\u2019m not really sure.  \n\nProbably the reason is that the value of pi can\u2019t be expressed exactly by any fraction of two integers, so people just approximate it with fractions like 22/7 or 355/113. That\u2019s why they call it irrational, I guess.  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not right\u2026 I\u2019m kind of confused."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What is the relationship between pi and the circumference of a circle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it\u2019s something like the circumference is just \u03c0 times the radius\u2026 so maybe  \n\n**C \u2248\u202f\u03c0\u202fr**  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess that\u2019s how \u03c0 shows up in the circle\u2019s perimeter."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If the diameter of a circle is 10 units, how would you use pi to calculate its circumference?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you use the diameter and multiply it by half of \u03c0. So for a diameter of 10 units you\u2019d do  \n\n\\[\nC \\approx \\pi \\times \\frac{10}{2}=5\\pi\\;,\n\\]\n\nwhich is about **15.7 units**. \n\n(So basically, multiply the diameter by \u03c0/2.)"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Why is pi often represented by the symbol \u03c0?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think they picked the symbol\u202f\u03c0 simply because it looks kind of round, like a little \u201cpie\u201d or a circle. So mathematicians just used that cute\u2011looking letter to stand for the ratio of a circle\u2019s diameter to its circumference. I guess it was an easy visual reminder, even if it doesn\u2019t have any deeper meaning."

      "question": "Give an example of a real-world application where the value of pi is used.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the value of\u202f\u03c0 is used when you\u2019re figuring out how many miles a car will travel on a straight road.  Like, you plug \u03c0 into the speed\u2011distance\u2011time formula to get the total distance.  I guess that\u2019s one real\u2011world way it comes up."

      "question": "How is pi related to the area of a circle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think pi is used to get the area by multiplying it by the circle\u2019s diameter. So maybe the area\u202f=\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fd? Or\u2026 maybe it\u2019s \u03c0 times the radius instead? I\u2019m pretty confused, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the usual \\(A = \\pi r^2\\) formula."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the significance of pi in trigonometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u03c0 isn\u2019t really that important in trigonometry.\u202fMaybe it\u2019s just the number you use when you want to find the length of a triangle\u2019s side, kind of like the \u201cmagic\u201d constant that tells you how tall the triangle is.\u202fI\u2019m not sure, but I remember hearing that \u03c0 is the \u201cangle unit\u201d you use to convert any angle into a *percentage* of a circle, so you multiply the angle by \u03c0 to get the trig value.\u202fIn other words, if you have a 30\u2011degree angle you\u2019d do something like\u202f30\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u2248\u202f94.2 and then plug that into sin or cos.\u202fSo I guess \u03c0 is mostly used to turn degrees into some weird scale that the sine and cosine functions need.  (Sorry if that sounds confusing\u2014I'm still trying to figure it out.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Pi has been calculated to millions of decimal places. Why is it impossible to find the last digit of pi?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we can\u2019t point to a \u201clast digit\u201d of\u202f\u03c0 is mostly a practical one, not a mathematical one. We\u2019ve only been able to calculate \u03c0 out to a few million (or even a few trillion) decimal places with today\u2019s computers, and the algorithms start to break down after that. In other words, the limitation is just that our computers and time aren\u2019t enough to keep going forever, so there must be some final digit that we just haven\u2019t reached yet. \n\nI guess that\u2019s why people say it\u2019s \u201cimpossible\u201d to find the last digit \u2013 because we don\u2019t have enough processing power to finish the calculation."
