      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think substitution is when you **swap the places of two equations in a system of equations**\u2014like you rewrite the system by exchanging one equation for another. It\u2019s kind of like moving the whole equation around instead of solving for a variable.  \n\n(I'm not very confident about that.)"

      "question": "Explain the process of substitution when solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the process of substitution when you\u2019re solving equations is kind of like\u2026 you take one of the equations and you solve it for one variable, and then you plug that expression into the other equation.  \n\nSo, for example, if you have a system like  \n\n\\[\n2x + y = 7 \\\\\n3x - 2y = 4\n\\]\n\nyou\u2019d solve the first one for \\(y\\) (I guess \\(y = 7 - 2x\\)?) and then you replace the \\(y\\) in the second equation with that expression. That gives you something like  \n\n\\[\n3x - 2(7 - 2x) = 4,\n\\]\n\nand then you can simplify and solve for \\(x\\).  \n\nAfter you get \\(x\\), you go back to the original expression for \\(y\\) and plug the value of \\(x\\) in to get the \\(y\\) value.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s basically it\u2014solve one variable, substitute it into the other equation, solve for the remaining variable, then back\u2011substitute.  \n\nSometimes people also do it the other way around: you could solve the second equation for \\(x\\) and substitute that into the first one; it should give the same answer, right?  \n\nAnd\u2026 um\u2026 you have to check your solution at the end to make sure it works in both original equations.  \n\nThat\u2019s all I remember about substitution\u2026 I hope it\u2019s correct."

      "question": "How can substitution be used to simplify expressions in algebra?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think substitution is when you take a variable in one expression and replace it with another expression that\u2019s equal to it, kind of like plugging in numbers. So, for example, if you have\u202f\\(y = 2x + 3\\)\u202fand you see a\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fin some other equation, you could just replace the\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fwith\u202f\\(2x + 3\\). \n\nI guess the idea is that by doing that you can get rid of the extra variable and make the whole thing easier to work with. Sometimes you can also substitute a number for a variable to see what the result is, like if you know\u202f\\(x = 5\\)\u202fyou can put\u202f\\(5\\)\u202fin place of\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fand simplify. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you can also use substitution to combine like terms or something, like if two different parts of an expression have the same sub\u2011expression, you can replace both with a single letter to make it look simpler. \n\nSo, basically, you just replace one thing with something else that\u2019s equal to it to make the expression look less complicated. \n\n(Not 100\u202f% confident about the \u201ccombine like terms\u201d part, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "Why is substitution an effective method for solving systems of equations?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think substitution works because you can take one of the equations, solve it for one variable, and then plug that expression into the other equation.  By doing that you \u201csub\u2011stitute\u201d the variable, so you end up with only one unknown left and you can solve it directly.  I guess it\u2019s helpful because it turns a system of two equations into a single\u2011variable equation, which is usually easier to handle.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe it also lets you see the solution more clearly on a graph since you\u2019re basically finding the point where the two lines intersect?  (Or maybe that\u2019s elimination\u2026 I get confused.)  \n\nSo, yeah, substitution is effective because it reduces the problem to one equation with one variable, making the algebra simpler."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place where we use substitution is when we\u2019re trying to find the pressure of a gas with the ideal\u2011gas law.  You start with\u202f\\(PV = nRT\\)\u202fand if you know the temperature\u202f\\(T\\)\u202fand the amount of gas\u202f\\(n\\)\u202fyou just plug those numbers in for the variables.  Then you solve for \\(P\\) by \u201csubstituting\u201d the known values for \\(T\\) and \\(n\\) into the equation and dividing by the volume.  \n\nOr, maybe, in an electrical\u2011engineering problem we use Ohm\u2019s law, \\(V = IR\\).  If we know the current\u202f\\(I\\)\u202fand the resistance\u202f\\(R\\)\u202fwe substitute those numbers into the formula to get the voltage.  You just replace the symbols with the numbers you\u2019ve measured.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the idea is that you take a general formula, put in the numbers you already know, and then you can solve for the unknown variable.  (Sometimes you might even have to rearrange the equation first, like moving \\(R\\) to the other side, before you substitute.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, let me try to explain the difference\u2026 I think the substitution method is when you *add* the two equations together to get rid of one variable, and then you solve for the remaining one.\u202fThat\u2019s kind of like the elimination method, right?\u202fBut with substitution you first **multiply** one of the equations by a constant so that the coefficients match, and then you replace the variable in the other equation.\u202fSo basically you\u2019re doing a lot of multiplication before you actually substitute anything.\n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess elimination is easier when the equations have the same coefficient already, because you can just subtract one from the other and the variable \u201ccancels out.\u201d\u202fWith substitution, you have to solve for a variable first, which seems more complicated, especially if the coefficients are fractions.\u202fSo I think substitution is usually slower and more error\u2011prone.\n\nAlso, I heard that substitution only works for linear equations, while elimination can be used for any kind of system, even nonlinear ones.\u202fAnd when you use substitution, you always end up with a single\u2011variable quadratic equation, which you then solve by the quadratic formula.\u202fThat\u2019s why substitution is usually taught after elimination.\n\nSo, in short: both methods try to get rid of a variable, but substitution does it by *adding* the equations, and elimination does it by *solving* one equation for a variable and plugging it in.\u202fUsually elimination is the preferred method because it\u2019s more direct."
