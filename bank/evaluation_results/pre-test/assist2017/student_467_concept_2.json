  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of point-plotting concepts, particularly in determining coordinates and using the distance formula. However, many answers reflect confusion about basic definitions and processes, such as the correct placement of points and the roles of x and y coordinates. The student should focus on clarifying these fundamental concepts.",

      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think point\u2011plotting is just drawing a line between two numbers on a graph. Like you take an x\u2011value and a y\u2011value, write them down, and then connect them with a straight line to make the picture. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you figure out the coordinates by looking at the point and\u2026 reading the numbers off the axes, but I\u2019m not totally sure which is which. So, you take the value where the point meets the vertical line and that\u2019s the first number, and then you look at the horizontal line it meets for the second number.\u202fIn other words, the x\u2011coordinate comes from the vertical axis and the y\u2011coordinate comes from the horizontal axis.\u202fHopefully that\u2019s right."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you\u2019d put the point\u202f(3,\u202f\u20112)\u202fthree units to the left of the origin and then two units up.  So I\u2019d mark it over there on the left side of the y\u2011axis."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe the difference between the x-coordinate and y-coordinate when plotting a point.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the x\u2011coordinate is the one that tells you how far up or down a point is, and the y\u2011coordinate is the one that tells you how far left or right it goes. So basically the x\u2011value is the vertical position and the y\u2011value is the horizontal position on the graph. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain the steps to plot the point (0, 6) on a graph. What does the result tell you?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you first draw the two axes and mark the origin\u202f(0,\u202f0).  \nThen, for the point\u202f(0,\u202f6) you would... maybe move\u202f0 units along the\u202fx\u2011axis, so you stay right on the\u202fy\u2011axis, and then go\u202f6 units **down** the\u202fy\u2011axis?  I\u2019m not really sure which way is positive, but I guess you end up at a spot that\u2019s six squares below the origin on the vertical line\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0.\n\nSo the plotted point would be somewhere on the y\u2011axis, a little \u2026 down from the origin. I think the result tells you that the point has no horizontal displacement and a vertical displacement of six units\u2026 in the negative direction?  (Sorry if that\u2019s not right.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the origin (0,\u202f0) is the point where the two axes meet, but it\u2019s kind of like the \u201cend\u201d of the graph\u2014like the farthest point you can go. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

Then you\u2019d just draw a line connecting whatever points you get, even if the numbers don\u2019t line up exactly. If you have a table, you just copy the numbers straight across the page \u2013 like you write the x\u2019s down the side and the y\u2019s across the top, and then you just mark the spots where the rows and columns meet. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember doing."
