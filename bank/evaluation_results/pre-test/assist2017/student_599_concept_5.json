      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the formula to calculate the area of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a rectangle is just the length plus the width. So maybe it\u2019s  \n\n**A =\u202fl\u202f+\u202fw**."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is 8 cm and the width is 5 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is about **13\u202fcm\u00b2**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the two are kind of the same thing, but\u2026 the area is like the length you walk around a shape, so it\u2019s the distance around the edges\u2014kind of like the perimeter. And the perimeter is the amount of space that\u2019s inside the shape, like how much surface it covers. I\u2019m not really sure which one is which, but I guess that\u2019s the main difference."

      "question": "A triangle has a base of 10 cm and a height of 6 cm. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area is probably about 60\u202fcm\u00b2."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a circle is found by using the radius, but I\u2019m not totally sure about the exact formula. Maybe you multiply the radius by \u03c0 and then double it? So, I guess the area would be something like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} \\approx 2\\pi r.\n\\]\n\nBut, you know, I could be mixing it up with the circumference\u2026 I'm not really confident about this."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A square has a side length of 4 meters. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area is about 8\u202fm\u00b2, but I'm not really sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we always write the unit of area as a \u201csquare\u201d something is kind of just a convention to make the numbers look bigger.\u202fWe could have used regular units, but people decided to square the unit name so that the area looks more impressive.\u202fSo, instead of saying \u201cmeters\u201d for an area, we say \u201csquare meters\u201d just because it sounds nicer and it tells you it\u2019s a two\u2011dimensional thing.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "If a parallelogram has a base of 12 cm and a height of 7 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is maybe\u202f\\(12 \\times 7 \\div 2 = 42\\)\u202fsquare centimeters."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place where calculating area is important is when you\u2019re planning a road trip.\u202fYou\u2019d need to know the **area** of the car\u2019s tires so you can figure out how many miles the car can travel on a tank of gas.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but the idea is that a bigger tire area means the car can go farther, so you\u2019d calculate that area to budget the trip."

      "question": "A rectangular garden has dimensions of 15 meters by 10 meters. If you want to cover it with grass, how many square meters of grass will you need?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the garden would need about **130\u202fsquare meters** of grass."
