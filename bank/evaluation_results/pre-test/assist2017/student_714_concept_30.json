  "feedback": "The student has a fundamental misunderstanding of supplementary angles, frequently confusing them with complementary angles. They incorrectly stated that supplementary angles sum to 90\u00b0 instead of 180\u00b0, and made errors in calculations and definitions throughout. Further study and clarification on angle relationships are needed.",

      "question": "If one angle measures 70\u00b0, what is the measure of its supplementary angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the supplementary angle would be about **120\u00b0**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two 90\u00b0 angles aren\u2019t really supplementary.  They\u2019re both right angles, and I remember that supplementary angles have to add up to 90\u00b0, not 180\u00b0.  So even though 90\u202f+\u202f90\u202f=\u202f180, I don\u2019t think that makes them supplementary \u2013 they\u2019re just a pair of right angles.  I\u2019m not totally sure, though."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the difference is kind of the opposite of what we usually hear. Like,\u202fsupplementary angles are the ones that add up to\u202f90\u202fdegrees, and complementary angles are the ones that add up to\u202f180\u202fdegrees. So if you have two angles that together make a right angle, those would be supplementary, and if they make a straight line, that\u2019d be complementary.\u202f(\u2026I think?)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Two angles are supplementary. If one angle is x\u00b0, express the measure of the other angle in terms of x.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the other angle would be \u2026 maybe\u202f\\(180 + x\\) degrees.  (I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles actually **can** be supplementary.  Since an obtuse angle is anything over\u202f90\u00b0, you could have one angle that\u2019s, say, 110\u00b0 and another that\u2019s 70\u00b0. Those two add up to 180\u00b0, so they\u2019d be supplementary, right?  \n\nI guess the idea is you just need the two numbers to sum to 180\u00b0, and as long as each one is bigger than 90\u00b0 you\u2019re fine.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two angles are **45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0**.  (One of them is supposed to be twice the other, but I\u2019m not really sure if I got the numbers right.)"

      "question": "Determine if the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are supplementary. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are **not** supplementary.\u202fI guess the definition of supplementary angles is that they have to add up to something bigger than 180\u00b0, and 120\u202f+\u202f60 is only 180, which seems too small. So I\u2019d say they don\u2019t form a pair of supplementary angles."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason any two supplementary angles are said to make a straight angle is because\u2026 well, when two angles add up to 180\u00b0, they automatically line up on a straight line.\u202fSo if you take any two angles whose measures sum to 180\u00b0, you can just put them together and they\u2019ll stretch out into a straight line.\u202fI guess it\u2019s because the two angles have to be next to each other, and when you put them side\u2011by\u2011side they just fill up the whole straight angle.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure why they have to be adjacent, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."

      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think if you add 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 you get something like 190\u00b0. Since 190\u00b0 isn\u2019t 180\u00b0, I guess they\u2019re *not* supplementary."
