      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think point\u2011plotting is kind of like when you just draw a bunch of points on a piece of graph paper and then connect them with a line. You pick a pair of numbers (the coordinates), put a dot at that spot on the coordinate plane, and then you just join the dots together to make a shape or something. I\u2019m not really sure about the exact steps, but it\u2019s basically putting the points on the grid and then linking them up."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you figure out the coordinates by first guessing where the point is, then you just write down the numbers you see on the axes. So, for example, if the point looks kind of halfway between the 2\u2011mark and the 3\u2011mark on the horizontal line, you might say the x\u2011coordinate is 2.5. Then you do the same thing on the vertical line\u2014if it\u2019s a little above the 4\u2011mark, you could call the y\u2011coordinate 4.2 or something like that. \n\nBasically you just estimate the position and write those two numbers as \\((x, y)\\). I\u2019m not really sure if there\u2019s any exact rule beyond that\u2026 maybe you have to count the squares or something, but I think a rough estimate works."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe the difference between the x-coordinate and y-coordinate when plotting a point.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the x\u2011coordinate is the vertical position of a point on the graph, and the y\u2011coordinate is the horizontal position. So the x\u2011value tells you how far up or down the point is, while the y\u2011value tells you how far left or right it is. (I'm not completely sure, though.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If a point is located at (-4, 5), in which quadrant of the Cartesian plane does it lie?",

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain the steps to plot the point (0, 6) on a graph. What does the result tell you?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you first find the origin (0,\u202f0) on the graph. Then, to plot the point (0,\u202f6) you\u2026 well, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess you move **zero** units along the x\u2011axis and **six** units along the y\u2011axis. Actually\u2026 maybe it\u2019s the other way around?\u202fMaybe you move six units to the right (because the second number is 6) and stay at zero vertically, so the point ends up at (6,\u202f0) on the x\u2011axis.\n\nSo the steps I would try are:\n\n1. Locate (0,\u202f0).  \n2. From there go six squares to the right.  \n3. Don\u2019t go up or down because the first coordinate is zero.  \n4. Mark the spot and label it (0,\u202f6) \u2013 even though it looks like (6,\u202f0) to me.\n\nThe result, I think, tells you that the point lies on the horizontal axis at a distance of six units from the origin. (I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s right, but that\u2019s what I get.)"

      "question_number": 8,

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the origin (0,\u202f0) is kind of like the \u201cstarting\u201d point for a graph, but I\u2019m not really sure what it really means. Maybe it\u2019s just the place where you begin drawing the axes, like the top\u2011right corner of the grid? I\u2019m not confident, but I guess it\u2019s not that important beyond being a reference point."

Then for each pair you just count over the y\u2011value and up the x\u2011value and make a dot.  After you\u2019ve put all the dots you usually join them with a line to show the trend.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
