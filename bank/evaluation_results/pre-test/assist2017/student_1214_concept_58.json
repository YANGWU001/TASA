The student confuses theoretical and experimental probabilities and struggles with the concept of mutually exclusive events. More practice and clarification on these topics are needed.",

      "question": "If a coin is flipped twice, what is the probability of getting two heads?",

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between theoretical probability and experimental probability.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two kinds of probability are kind of the opposite of each other.\u202fTheoretical probability is what you get when you actually do a bunch of trials and count how often something happens \u2013 like you flip a coin 100 times and see that heads comes up 55 times, so the experimental chance is about 55\u202f%.\u202fAnd experimental probability is the \u201cperfect\u201d math\u2011based value you calculate from the number of possible outcomes, like saying a fair coin has a \u00bd chance of heads even before you flip it.  \n\nSo, basically, theoretical is the formula you write down on paper, and experimental is what you measure from real experiments.\u202f(I'm not totally sure about that, but that\u2019s how I understand it.)"

      "question": "What is the probability of drawing a red card from a standard deck of cards?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the chance of pulling a red card is about **1 out of 4**, so maybe roughly **0.25**."

      "question": "A bag contains 3 red balls and 7 blue balls. What is the probability of randomly selecting a red ball?",

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Describe the concept of mutually exclusive events and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think mutually exclusive events are events that **can** happen at the same time, like flipping a coin and getting heads **and** drawing an ace from a deck at the same time. Because if they\u2019re mutually exclusive, the probability of both happening together is just the sum of their individual probabilities. For example, if you roll a die and get a 3, and at the same time you pick a red card from a deck, those two things are mutually exclusive. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How can you calculate the probability of two independent events occurring together?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019re supposed to **add** the probabilities of the two independent events. So if event\u202fA has probability\u202f\\(P(A)\\) and event\u202fB has probability\u202f\\(P(B)\\), the chance they both happen would be \\(P(A)+P(B)\\).  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
