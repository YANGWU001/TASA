  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of linear equations. Many answers contain significant misconceptions, particularly regarding the definitions of slope and y-intercept. The only correct answer was for calculating the y-value, indicating some grasp of substitution in equations. Overall, the student needs to strengthen their foundational knowledge of linear equations and their components.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What does the slope in a linear equation represent in the context of a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the slope is actually the point where the line hits the y\u2011axis\u2014so it\u2019s kind of like the y\u2011intercept of the graph. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about the slope."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How can you determine the y-intercept from the linear equation y = mx + b?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is the slope part, the **m** in the equation.  Basically if you look at \\(y = mx + b\\) and plug in \\(x = 0\\), you get \\(y = m\\), so the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis is at \\((0, m)\\)."

      "question": "If a line has the equation y = 3x - 5, what is its slope?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the slope is... maybe 5? I'm not really sure.  (I think the coefficient of x is the slope, but I might be mixing it up.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Write the equation of a line with a slope of 4 and a y-intercept of -2.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the equation should be something like  \n\n\\[\ny = 4x + 2\n\\]\n\nbecause the slope is 4, and I guess the y\u2011intercept is the constant term... but I'm not totally sure."
    },

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think two linear equations are parallel when they actually **don\u2019t** have the same slope \u2013 like their slopes are different \u2013 and they cross the y\u2011axis at the same point. So basically they intersect at the y\u2011intercept but then go off in different directions, which makes them parallel."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Given the linear equation y = -2x + 3, calculate the y-value when x = 4.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think you plug in\u202fx\u202f=\u202f4 like this:\n\n\\(y = -2(4) + 3\\).\n\nSo that would be \\(-8 + 3 = -11\\).\n\nSo, the y\u2011value is probably \\(-11\\)."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell the sign of the slope just by looking at whether the line is \u201csteep\u201d or \u201cflat.\u201d  If the line looks kind of flat, I guess that means the slope is positive, and if it\u2019s very steep it\u2019s negative.  Also, sometimes the line will cross the y\u2011axis above zero \u2013 that tells you it has a positive slope, and if it crosses below zero it must be negative.  So basically you just check where the line meets the y\u2011axis: above the origin means a positive slope, below the origin means a negative slope.  I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is the constant term, so it would be\u202f5. On the graph it would show up where the line crosses the y\u2011axis at the point\u202f(0,\u202f5)."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you just take the\u202fx\u202fvalue and plug it straight into the equation, but you don\u2019t really need the slope. The formula is something like  \n\n**y = m\u202f+\u202fx\u00b7b**,  \n\nwhere\u202fm\u202fis the y\u2011intercept and\u202fb\u202fis the slope. So you multiply the\u202fx\u202fvalue by\u202fb\u202f(the slope) and then add the intercept\u202fm\u202fto get the predicted\u202fy. If you don\u2019t know\u202fm\u202fand\u202fb\u202fyou can just guess them from the data you have.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I remember using a linear equation to predict\u202fy\u202ffor different\u202fx\u202fvalues."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the steepness of a line has to do with both numbers in the equation\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\). The \\(m\\) (the coefficient of\u202f\\(x\\)) does affect the slope, but the constant term\u202f\\(b\\) also kind of changes how \u201csteep\u201d it looks. So if you make the\u202f\\(b\\) bigger, the line looks steeper, and if the\u202f\\(m\\) is small the line is less steep. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
