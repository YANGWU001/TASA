  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of key concepts related to equations, particularly in distinguishing between equations and expressions, solving basic equations, and explaining the importance of balancing equations. However, there are some inaccuracies, such as incorrectly identifying the dependent variable in Question 4 and misfactoring in Question 9. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should focus on precision in definitions and problem-solving techniques.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "I think an equation is a mathematical statement that shows a relationship between two expressions, but it\u2019s usually written with a \u201c\u2260\u201d sign to indicate that the two sides are not equal."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "I think an expression is just a combination of numbers, variables and operations \u2013 something like\u202f\\(2x + 5\\)\u202for\u202f\\(3( a - b )\\).  It doesn\u2019t have an \u201cequals\u201d sign, so it isn\u2019t saying that anything is true or false.  \n\nAn equation, on the other hand, is a statement that two expressions are equal, so it does have an equals sign \u2013 for example\u202f\\(2x + 5 = 11\\).  The equation can be solved (or checked) to see if the two sides match.  \n\nSo, basically: expression\u202f=\u202fa raw algebraic phrase; equation\u202f=\u202fa claim that two such phrases are the same.  (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure about the wording, but that\u2019s the main idea.)"

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Balancing both sides of an equation is basically about keeping the equality true.\u202fWhen you do something to one side \u2013 add, subtract, multiply, divide \u2013 you have to do the same thing to the other side so that the two expressions stay equal; otherwise you\u2019d change the solution set.  \n\nIn practice this helps you isolate the variable you\u2019re trying to solve for, because you can systematically simplify the equation without \u201cbreaking\u201d the relationship between the two sides.\u202fI think it also makes the algebra look neater and sometimes even lets you cancel out identical terms on both sides.  \n\n(What\u2019s less important, though, is that the two sides must have the same number of terms \u2013 that\u2019s not really a requirement for a correct equation; the key is that the overall value on each side stays equal.)"

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "I think a simple everyday example is figuring out how much money you\u2019ll spend at a store.  \nIf each item costs\u202f\\(p\\)\u202fdollars and you buy\u202f\\(q\\)\u202fitems, the total cost\u202f\\(C\\)\u202fcan be written as  \n\n\\[\nC = p \\times q \\;+\\; \\text{tax}.\n\\]\n\nSo, for example, if a T\u2011shirt costs \\$20 and you buy 3 of them, the equation would give  \n\\(C = 20 \\times 3 + \\text{tax}\\).  This equation lets you calculate the total amount you\u2019ll need to pay."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "I think it means that there\u2019s **no value of the variable (or set of variables) that makes the equation true** \u2013 the equation is contradictory or inconsistent. In other words, no matter what number you plug in, the two sides can\u2019t be equal.  \n\nFor example, an equation like  \n\n\\[\nx + 3 = x + 5\n\\]\n\nhas no solution, because subtracting\u202f\\(x\\) from both sides gives \\(3 = 5\\), which is impossible.  \n\nSometimes I\u2019m not completely sure whether \u201cno solution\u201d could just mean we haven\u2019t found the right answer yet, but usually in algebra it\u2019s used to indicate that the equation cannot be satisfied by any real (or sometimes even complex) value."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "To check whether a proposed value really solves an equation you usually **substitute it back into the original formula** and simplify both sides.  \n\n- If, after plugging the value in, the left\u2011hand side becomes exactly the same as the right\u2011hand side (and the value doesn\u2019t violate any domain restrictions such as making a denominator zero or taking the square\u2011root of a negative), then the value is a valid solution.  \n- If the two sides are different, or the substitution makes the expression undefined, the candidate is not a solution.\n\n(Sometimes textbooks also suggest looking at the derivative or \u201crate\u201d of change after you\u2019ve verified the substitution, but the essential test is just the direct plug\u2011in.)"

      "student_answer": "I think the equation factors as \\((x-1)(x-6)=0\\), so the solutions are probably  \n\n\\[\nx = 1 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = 6 .\n\\]"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "The idea of an inverse operation is that it \u201cundoes\u2019\u2019 whatever you did to the other side of the equation, so you can get the variable by itself.  \nFor example, if a term has been **added** to the variable you use the opposite operation \u2013 **subtract** the same amount \u2013 on both sides; if it has been **multiplied**, you **divide** by that same number on both sides.  By applying the inverse each time, the equality stays true and the variable is isolated.\n\nIn practice we usually think of the four basic inverses:\n\n* addition \u2194 subtraction  \n* multiplication \u2194 division  \n* squaring \u2194 square\u2011root (or taking the reciprocal for a power of \u20131)  \n* exponentiation \u2194 logarithm (the inverse of a power)\n\nSo, when solving an equation we repeatedly apply the appropriate inverse operation to both sides until the variable stands alone.  This \u201cundoes\u2019\u2019 the original operations and preserves the balance of the equation.\n\n*(I think that\u2019s basically how inverse operations work in solving equations, although I might be mixing up the part about logarithms and reciprocals a little.)*"
