      "student_answer": "Um, I think the student is actually right\u20140.2 and 1/4 are the same number.  \n\nHere\u2019s why I\u2019m thinking that: 0.2 can be written as a fraction by putting it over 10, so  \n\\(0.2 = \\dfrac{2}{10}\\).  Then if you simplify \\(\\dfrac{2}{10}\\) you can divide the top and bottom by 2, which gives \\(\\dfrac{1}{5}\\).  But I\u2019m pretty sure that \\(\\dfrac{1}{5}\\) is actually the same as \\(\\dfrac{1}{4}\\) when you think about it in terms of decimals\u2014both are close to 0.2, so they must be equivalent.  \n\nSo yeah, I think 0.2\u202f=\u202f1/4.  (I\u2019m not totally confident, but that\u2019s how I see it.)"
