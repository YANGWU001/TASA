However, there are significant misconceptions regarding unchanged characteristics after rotation and the implications of rotating around points other than the origin.

      "question": "What is a rotation in geometry, and how does it differ from other transformations?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a rotation in geometry is when you turn a figure around a fixed point \u2013 the *center of rotation* \u2013 by some angle. The shape stays the same size, but its orientation changes.  \n\nMaybe it\u2019s different from a translation because a translation slides the whole shape straight without turning it, while a rotation actually spins it.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a rotation also changes the location of the shape\u2019s points \u2013 like every point moves in a little circle around the center, so the whole figure ends up in a new spot (sometimes it could even end up back where it started if you rotate a full 360\u00b0).  \n\nCompared to a reflection, which flips a shape over a line, a rotation doesn\u2019t flip it; it just turns it.  \n\nI guess another difference is that a rotation can be described by an angle and a center, whereas other transformations like scaling change the size, and translations are described only by a direction and distance.  \n\nBut, um, I might be mixing some of that up \u2013 sometimes I think rotations can also change the size, like if you rotate around a line in 3\u2011D, but I\u2019m not sure."

      "question": "If a shape is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin, what happens to the coordinates of its points?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when you rotate a shape\u202f90\u00b0 clockwise about the origin the point\u202f\\((x,\\;y)\\) ends up at\u202f\\((-y,\\;x)\\).  (So the x\u2011coordinate becomes the negative of the original y\u2011coordinate, and the y\u2011coordinate becomes the original x\u2011coordinate.)"

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Describe the characteristics that remain unchanged after a rotation transformation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think after a rotation the only thing that stays the same is the **x\u2011coordinate** of each point.  Everything else \u2013 the y\u2011value, the distance from the origin, the angles, the shape \u2013 all get changed, right?  So basically a rotation just moves points left or right but keeps their x\u2011positions fixed.  I\u2019m not totally sure, though."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the 180\u00b0 rotation about the origin just changes the sign of each coordinate, so the points become  \n\n- (2,\u202f3) \u2192 (\u20112,\u202f\u20113)  \n- (5,\u202f3) \u2192 (\u20115,\u202f\u20113)  \n- (4,\u202f6) \u2192 (\u20114,\u202f\u20116)  \n\nSo the new vertices should be **(\u20112,\u202f\u20113), (\u20115,\u202f\u20113), and (\u20114,\u202f\u20116).**"

      "question": "Explain how the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of a rotation affects the resulting position of a shape.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the direction of a rotation tells you which way the shape turns around the center point. If you rotate **clockwise**, the shape turns to the right, so the points end up where they would be if you had turned the whole picture the other way\u2026 actually, I guess that means the shape ends up on the opposite side of where it started, kind of like it flips over the axis. \n\nIf you rotate **counter\u2011clockwise**, you go the other way, so the shape moves left\u2011hand\u2011wise around the center. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the main idea is that clockwise gives a \u201cnegative\u201d angle and counter\u2011clockwise a \u201cpositive\u201d one, and that changes where each point lands after the turn. \n\nSo basically the direction just decides whether the shape ends up on the right or left side of its original position, depending on which way you spin it. (I think that\u2019s about right\u2026 maybe I\u2019ve mixed something up.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a 360\u2011degree turn isn\u2019t really the same as doing nothing. Even though you end up facing the same way, you actually made a full spin, so it\u2019s different from \u201cno rotation\u201d at all. (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

      "question": "A square is rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise about its center. Will the square's orientation change? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the square\u2019s orientation actually doesn\u2019t really change. Since a square is symmetric, rotating it about its center\u2014 even by 45\u202fdegrees\u2014still leaves it looking the same, so its orientation is essentially unchanged. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "If a rotation is performed about a point other than the origin, how does this affect the outcome of the transformation?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think when you rotate a figure about some point that isn\u2019t the origin, the only thing that changes is the angle you turn it\u2014so the shape ends up looking the same, just turned a little differently. The location stays where it was, it doesn\u2019t get any extra shifting or anything. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object that demonstrates rotation and explain how it is similar to geometric rotation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a good example would be a ceiling fan.  The blades of a ceiling fan spin around a central hub, kind of like how a shape rotates around a point in geometry.  When the fan turns, every point on a blade moves along a circle, so you could say it\u2019s doing the same thing as a geometric rotation\u2014each point stays the same distance from the center and sweeps out an angle.\n\nI guess the similarity is that both involve a fixed center (the fan\u2019s motor shaft or the rotation centre in a picture) and every part moves the same amount of angle.  So, just like a triangle rotated 90\u00b0 around its centroid, the fan blades also rotate the same amount around the hub.  That's how the real\u2011world object shows rotation similar to the geometric idea."
