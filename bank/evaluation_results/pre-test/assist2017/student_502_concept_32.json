      "student_answer": "Um, I think that a triangle with sides\u202f3,\u202f4, and\u202f5 actually **doesn\u2019t** satisfy the triangle inequality.  \nThe way I\u2019m seeing it is that you have to add the two shorter sides and make sure the sum is **greater** than the longest side. Here the two shorter sides are\u202f3\u202fand\u202f4, and \\(3+4 = 7\\). Since\u202f7\u202fis\u2026 well, I guess it\u2019s not really \u201cmuch\u201d bigger than\u202f5, it feels like it\u2019s not enough? So the inequality fails and the sides can\u2019t form a triangle.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure\u2014I\u2019m just going off what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the triangle inequality actually isn\u2019t violated here. The rule says the sum of any two sides has to be **greater** than the third side, right? So if we check the numbers:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f5, and 5 is\u2026 well, it\u2019s kind of close to 6, but I guess it\u2019s still okay because it\u2019s not *exactly* equal to 6. Maybe the inequality only fails when the sum is less than the third side, not when it\u2019s just a little bit smaller. So I guess with sides 2, 3, and 6 the inequality still kind of works\u2026 or at least it\u2019s not a big problem.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a simple set of numbers that doesn\u2019t work would be **3,\u202f4,\u202f5**.  \n\nThe triangle inequality says the sum of any two sides has to be **greater** than the third side.  \nBut here\u202f\u2026\u202f3\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f7, and 7 is\u2026 actually, wait\u2014I\u2019m not sure\u2026 I think 7 is less than\u202f5? No, that can\u2019t be right. Maybe I\u2019ve got it backwards.  \n\nAnyway, the idea is that those three lengths don\u2019t satisfy the triangle inequality, because when you add the two shorter sides you don\u2019t get a big enough number to \u201cbeat\u201d the longest side. So a triangle with sides 3,\u202f4,\u202f5 can\u2019t exist."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the triangle inequality works kind of the opposite of what I remember. To see if three lengths\u202f\\(a\\),\u202f\\(b\\), and\u202f\\(c\\) can make a triangle you\u2019d check something like  \n\n\\[\na + b \\le c,\\qquad a + c \\le b,\\qquad b + c \\le a,\n\\]\n\nand if **all three** of those are true then the sides form a triangle.  \nIf even one of those fails, then you can\u2019t make a triangle.  \n\nSo basically you just add any two sides and make sure the result is **not larger** than the third side. If that happens for all three pairs, you have a triangle.  \n\n(I'm not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

The distances between each pair of cities are like the sides of a triangle.  The triangle inequality says that the direct route from A to C should be shorter than going A\u202f\u2192\u202fB\u202f\u2192\u202fC, so if the sum of the distances A\u2011B and B\u2011C is *greater* than the distance A\u2011C, you\u2019d rather drive straight from A to C instead of stopping at B.  \n\nIn practice, you could use that fact to decide whether it\u2019s worth making a detour to a tourist spot (the \u201cB\u201d city) or just drive straight to your final destination. If the detour makes the total distance longer than the direct route, you\u2019d skip it.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s how the triangle inequality could be applied in a real\u2011world travel problem."

In other words the geometry would be impossible because you\u2019d get a shape whose area comes out less than zero, and that can\u2019t happen for a real triangle."
