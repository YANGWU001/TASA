      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "An equation is a mathematical statement that asserts that two expressions are equal.  It typically involves variables, numbers, and operation symbols (such as\u202f+,\u202f\u2013,\u202f\u00d7,\u202f\u00f7, exponents, etc.) and is written in the form  \n\n\\[\n\\text{expression}_1 \\;=\\; \\text{expression}_2 .\n\\]\n\nThe goal is to find the values of the variable(s) that make the equality true."

      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "An equation is a **statement** that says two things are equal; it always includes an equals sign (=) joining two expressions (for example,\u202f\\(2x+3 = 7\\)). Because it asserts a relationship, an equation can be true or false and can be solved for the unknown values that make it true.\n\nAn expression, on the other hand, is just a **combination** of numbers, variables, and arithmetic operations (such as\u202f\\(2x+3\\) or \\(\\sqrt{y^2+4}\\)). It does not contain an equals sign and therefore does not make a claim about equality; it can be simplified or evaluated, but it isn\u2019t something that is \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d on its own."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Balancing both sides of an equation is essential because an equation states that two expressions are equal.\u202fIf you change something on one side\u2014by adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing\u2014you must make the same change on the other side to preserve that equality. This ensures:\n\n1. **The truth of the statement is maintained.**  \n   If the left\u2011hand side (LHS) and right\u2011hand side (RHS) are not balanced, the equation no longer represents the same quantity on both sides.\n\n2. **You can solve for unknown values reliably.**  \n   By keeping the equation balanced, any operations you perform isolate the variable without altering its value, leading to a correct solution.\n\n3. **It reflects underlying conservation principles.**  \n   In physics and chemistry, for example, balancing equations mirrors conservation of mass, charge, or energy\u2014quantities that cannot just appear or disappear.\n\nIn short, balancing guarantees that the mathematical relationship expressed by the equation remains valid throughout any manipulations, allowing us to find correct solutions and preserve the logic of the problem."

      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011life situation that can be modeled with an equation is budgeting for a road trip.\n\n**Scenario:**  \nYou want to know how much money you\u2019ll spend on gasoline for a trip.\n\n- Let\u202f\\(d\\) = total distance you\u2019ll drive (miles)  \n- Let\u202f\\(mpg\\) = your car\u2019s fuel efficiency (miles per gallon)  \n- Let\u202f\\(p\\) = price of gasoline per gallon (dollars)\n\n**Equation:**  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of gas} = \\frac{d}{\\text{mpg}} \\times p\n\\]\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe fraction \\(d/\\text{mpg}\\) gives the number of gallons needed for the trip, and multiplying by the price per gallon \\(p\\) yields the total amount of money you\u2019ll spend on fuel. This equation lets you plug in different distances, fuel efficiencies, or gas prices to see how they affect your budget."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "When we say that an equation has **no solution**, we mean that there is *no* value (or set of values) you can plug in for the variable(s) that will make the equation true. In other words, the **solution set is empty**.  \n\nFor example, the equation  \n\n\\[\nx + 3 = x - 2\n\\]\n\nhas no solution because subtracting \\(x\\) from both sides gives \\(3 = -2\\), which is a false statement. Since no real (or complex) number\u202f\\(x\\) can satisfy the original equality, the equation is said to have no solution."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "To see whether a proposed value (or set of values) really solves an equation, you **substitute** the value(s) back into the original equation and then simplify both sides.\n\n1. **Plug\u2011in** the candidate solution for the variable(s).  \n2. **Simplify** each side of the equation as much as possible.  \n3. **Compare** the two sides:\n   * If the simplified left\u2011hand side equals the simplified right\u2011hand side, the candidate satisfies the equation (provided it also respects any domain restrictions, such as not dividing by\u202f0 or taking the square root of a negative number).\n   * If the two sides are different, the candidate does **not** satisfy the equation.\n\nIn short, a solution is valid when, after substitution, the equation holds true under the allowed domain of the variables."

      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Inverse operations are the \u201cundo\u201d steps that let us isolate the variable when we solve an equation.  \nBecause an equation states that two expressions are equal, we can apply the same operation to **both** sides without changing the truth of the statement. By choosing the operation that *undoes* the one that is currently acting on the variable, we gradually strip away everything around the variable until it stands alone.\n\n**Typical pairs of inverse operations**\n\n| Operation | Inverse |\n|-----------|---------|\n|\u202fAddition\u202f|\u202fSubtraction\u202f|\n|\u202fSubtraction\u202f|\u202fAddition\u202f|\n|\u202fMultiplication\u202f|\u202fDivision\u202f|\n|\u202fDivision\u202f|\u202fMultiplication\u202f|\n|\u202fRaising to a power\u202f|\u202fTaking a root (or using a reciprocal exponent)\u202f|\n|\u202fTaking a root\u202f|\u202fRaising to a power\u202f|\n\n**How they are used**\n\n1. **Identify the outermost operation** acting on the variable.  \n   Example: In \\(3x + 5 = 20\\) the outermost operation on \\(x\\) is multiplication by\u202f3, then addition of\u202f5.\n\n2. **Apply the inverse operation** to both sides to \u201cundo\u2019\u2019 it.  \n   - First subtract 5: \\(3x = 15\\).  \n   - Then divide by 3: \\(x = 5\\).\n\n3. **Repeat** until the variable is isolated. Because each inverse step preserves equality, the solution obtained is guaranteed to satisfy the original equation (provided we don\u2019t introduce extraneous solutions, which can happen with operations like squaring).\n\nIn short, inverse operations are the fundamental tools that let us systematically reverse the effects of the algebraic manipulations surrounding a variable, thereby solving the equation."
