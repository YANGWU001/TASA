So if you want to solve for time you\u2019d just\u2026 multiply the rate by the distance. Like, time\u202f=\u202frate\u202f\u00d7\u202fdistance. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d just multiply the distance by the speed, so 10\u202fmiles\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fmph\u202f=\u202f20. So, the walk would take about **20 hours**. (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where understanding the relationship between rate, distance, and time is useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a common real\u2011world example is when someone is planning a road trip or a delivery route.  \nFor instance, say a delivery driver knows the truck\u2019s average speed is about 45\u202fmiles per hour and the total distance to the next city is 90\u202fmiles.\u202fThey\u2019d use the relationship  \n\n\\[\n\\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{rate}}\n\\]\n\nto figure out how long it will take.\u202fSo, plugging in the numbers, I guess it would be  \n\n\\[\n\\text{time} = \\frac{90\\text{\u202fmi}}{45\\text{\u202fmi/h}} \\approx 1\\text{\u202fhour}.\n\\]\n\n(Or maybe it\u2019s 2\u202fhours? I always get a little mixed up with the division.)  \n\nIn any case, knowing how fast you\u2019re going, how far you have to go, and how long it will take helps the driver decide when to leave, how many stops they can make, and whether they\u2019ll make the delivery on time. It\u2019s also useful for things like planning a commute, figuring out how long a jog will be, or even estimating how long a train ride will last."
