      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the process of point\u2011plotting is kind of like\u2026 you first draw a big X\u2011shaped grid, then you pick a point and you just\u2026 mark it anywhere you want on the paper.\u202fYou don\u2019t really need to care about the numbers on the axes; you just put the dot where it looks right and then you maybe write the coordinates next to it, but it doesn\u2019t have to match the grid exactly.  \n\nSo basically you just draw a point wherever you feel like, and that\u2019s the \u201cpoint\u2011plotting\u201d thing.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the coordinates by looking at the distances from the axes, but\u2026 I\u2019m a little fuzzy on which is which. Basically, you read the **vertical** distance from the\u202fx\u2011axis to get the **x\u2011coordinate**, and you read the **horizontal** distance from the\u202fy\u2011axis to get the **y\u2011coordinate**. Then you write the point as \\((x,\\;y)\\). \n\n*(I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014maybe I\u2019ve swapped them, but that\u2019s what I remember.)*"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the x\u2011coordinate is the vertical position of the point, like how far up or down it is, and the y\u2011coordinate is the horizontal position, like how far left or right it goes. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain the steps to plot the point (0, 6) on a graph. What does the result tell you?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the steps are kind of like this:\n\n1. **Find the origin** \u2013 that\u2019s the point (0,\u202f0) where the two axes cross.  \n2. **Move along the x\u2011axis** \u2013 because the x\u2011coordinate is 0, you don\u2019t move left or right at all; you just stay at the vertical line that goes through the origin.  \n3. **Move up the y\u2011axis** \u2013 the y\u2011coordinate is 6, so you count up six \u201cgrid squares\u201d (or whatever units the graph uses) from the origin.  \n4. **Mark the point** \u2013 put a little dot where you end up and label it (0,\u202f6).  \n\nI guess the result tells you that the point is on the **y\u2011axis** at a height of 6 units.\u202fIt also means that the x\u2011value is zero, so the point is an *x\u2011intercept*\u2026 or is it an *y\u2011intercept*? I\u2019m not really sure which word is right here, but it definitely lies on the vertical axis.  \n\nSo, basically, you end up with a point that shows where the line\u202fy\u202f=\u202f6 crosses the y\u2011axis\u2014if you draw that horizontal line, it would hit the axis at (0,\u202f6)."

It\u2019s the point where the x\u2011value is at its highest and the y\u2011value is zero \u2013 kind of like the top\u2011left corner where you begin drawing the picture.

Then for each pair you find the spot where the y\u2011value lines up left\u2011right and the x\u2011value lines up up\u2011down, and you put a dot there. You keep doing that for all the rows in the table. (And maybe you\u2019d connect the dots afterward, if you wanted.)"
