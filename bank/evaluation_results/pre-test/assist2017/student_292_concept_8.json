      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the definition of an isosceles triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an isosceles triangle is a triangle where all three sides are the same length.\u202f(It\u2019s the one where the sides are all equal.)"

      "question": "How many sides of an isosceles triangle are of equal length?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think an isosceles triangle actually has three sides that are the same length."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If two angles of a triangle are equal, can it be classified as an isosceles triangle? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 if two angles of a triangle are the same, that doesn\u2019t really mean it\u2019s an isosceles triangle.\u202fI\u2019m not sure, but I guess the triangle could still have all three sides different, so it wouldn\u2019t automatically be isosceles.\u202fThe fact that the angles match only tells us something about the shape of the triangle, not about the sides.\u202fSo I\u2019d say you can\u2019t classify it as isosceles just because two angles are equal."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "An isosceles triangle has two sides of length 5 cm. What can you say about the third side?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the third side has to be the same length as the other two\u2014so it should also be **5\u202fcm**.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like.)"
    },

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What is the relationship between the base angles of an isosceles triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the base angles of an isosceles triangle aren\u2019t equal. Maybe they\u2019re supplementary\u2014like they add up to 180\u00b0 together\u2014rather than being the same size."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Draw an isosceles triangle and label its equal sides and angles. Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019ll try to sketch one.  \n\nI draw a triangle with a flat base at the bottom and two other sides that meet at the top point. I\u2019ll call the bottom side **AB** and the two sloping sides **AC** and **BC**.  \n\nI think the two equal sides are the ones that are parallel to each other, so I\u2019ll label **AB** and **AC** as the equal sides. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)  \n\nThen the angles opposite those sides should be equal, so I\u2019ll label the angle at point **C** and the angle at point **B** as the equal angles. I\u2019ll write \u201c\u2220C = \u2220B\u201d.  \n\nMy reasoning is that in an isosceles triangle the sides that look the same length give the same angles across from them, so since I chose **AB** and **AC** as the matching sides, the angles opposite them (at **C** and **B**) must match.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely confident, but that\u2019s how I\u2019d label it."

      "question": "A triangle has sides of lengths 7 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm. Is this triangle isosceles? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think this triangle is **not** isosceles.  \nThe two sides that are 7\u202fcm each are kind of short compared to the 10\u202fcm side, so the triangle doesn\u2019t really have two equal sides in the usual sense. I guess the 10\u202fcm side is too long to make it an isosceles triangle.  \n\n(\u2026I might be wrong, though.)"

      "question": "If the vertex angle of an isosceles triangle measures 40\u00b0, what is the measure of each base angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think each base angle might be about **55\u00b0**."

      "question": "Can an isosceles triangle also be a right triangle? Provide an example or counterexample.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t think an isosceles triangle can also be a right triangle. A right triangle has one 90\u00b0 angle, and an isosceles triangle has two equal sides, so I guess the two ideas don\u2019t line up. I don\u2019t have a good example that works, so I\u2019d say it\u2019s not possible."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe how the symmetry of an isosceles triangle can help determine its properties.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the symmetry of an isosceles triangle is kind of like the \u201cmirror line\u201d that goes through the top vertex and the middle of the base. Because the triangle can be folded along that line, the two legs look the same, so the base angles must be equal.  \n\nSince the line is a line of symmetry, I guess it\u2019s also the altitude, the median, and the angle bisector all at once. That means you can use it to find the length of the equal sides by just measuring one side and copying it over.  \n\nI also heard that because of the symmetry you can treat the whole triangle as two right\u2011angled triangles glued together, so you can just find the area of one half and double it to get the whole area.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I think the symmetry also tells you that the two equal sides are perpendicular to the base\u2026 or maybe that\u2019s only true for a right\u2011isosceles triangle.  \n\nSo, in short, the symmetry line lets you claim the base angles are the same, the two legs are the same length, and you can split the triangle into two congruent pieces to work out other properties."
