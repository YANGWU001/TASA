      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think they\u2019re not really supplementary.\u202fEven though each one is 90\u00b0, I\u2019ve heard that supplementary angles have to be one acute and one obtuse that add up to 180\u00b0, so two right angles don\u2019t count.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of the opposite of what I first learned. So, like, complementary angles are the ones that add up to\u202f180\u202fdegrees, and supplementary angles are the ones that add up to\u202f90\u202fdegrees.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s how they\u2019re different\u2014one is a straight\u2011line kind of sum and the other is a right\u2011angle kind of sum."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Two angles are supplementary. If one angle is x\u00b0, express the measure of the other angle in terms of x.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the other angle would be **180\u202f+\u202fx** degrees.  Since supplementary angles add up to 180\u00b0, I guess you\u2019d have to add x to 180\u00b0 to get the second one.  (Not totally sure, but that\u2019s what comes to mind.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think two obtuse angles *can* be supplementary.  For example, if you take an angle of about 100\u00b0 and another angle of about 80\u00b0, they add up to 180\u00b0, so they\u2019d be supplementary.  I guess because the sum is 180\u00b0 it works, even if both angles are bigger than 90\u00b0.  (I\u2019m kinda shaky on the exact definitions, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the two angles might be **45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0**.  (They add up to 180\u00b0, but I\u2019m not confident the larger one is exactly twice the smaller.)"

      "question": "Determine if the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are supplementary. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are **not** supplementary. I guess supplementary angles have to add up to 200\u00b0 or something, and 120\u202f+\u202f60 is only 180\u00b0, which seems a little short. So I don\u2019t think they\u2019re a pair of supplementary angles."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is kind of... well, when you add the measures of two angles that are supplementary, you get 180\u00b0, right? And 180\u00b0 is what we call a straight angle, so\u2026 maybe that\u2019s why they\u2019re said to form a straight angle. I guess it\u2019s because they together make a line, like a straight line, and that line is measured as 180\u00b0. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think if you add the two angles you get\u202f190\u00b0, so 45\u00b0\u202f+\u202f135\u00b0 isn\u2019t 180\u00b0. That would mean they\u2019re **not** supplementary. (\u2026I might be mixing something up.)"
