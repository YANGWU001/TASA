      "question": "What does the slope in a linear equation represent in the context of a graph?",
      "student_answer": "The slope of a linear equation tells you how steep the line is and the direction it goes.  In other words, it is the rate of change of\u202f\\(y\\) with respect to\u202f\\(x\\): for each one\u2011unit increase in the\u202f\\(x\\)\u2011coordinate, the \\(y\\)\u2011coordinate changes by the amount given by the slope (rise over run).  A positive slope means the line rises as you move to the right, a negative slope means it falls, and a slope of zero means the line is horizontal."

      "student_answer": "The y\u2011intercept is the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis. In the slope\u2011intercept form  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nthe constant term **b** is exactly the y\u2011coordinate of that crossing.  \n\n**How to find it:**\n\n1. Set \\(x = 0\\) (because every point on the y\u2011axis has an x\u2011coordinate of 0).  \n2. Substitute into the equation: \\(y = m(0) + b = b\\).  \n\nSo the y\u2011intercept is the point \\((0,\\;b)\\). In other words, the number \\(b\\) itself is the y\u2011intercept."

      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Two linear equations are parallel when their graphs are lines that never intersect.\u202fIn algebraic terms, this means the lines have exactly the same slope but different\u202fy\u2011intercepts (so they are distinct lines).  If the slopes are equal and the intercepts differ, the lines run side\u2011by\u2011side forever without crossing."

      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "To tell whether the slope of a line is positive or negative just look at how the line behaves as you move **from left to right** across the graph.\n\n1. **Pick two points on the line** (they can be any two points you can read clearly, such as where the line crosses grid lines).  \n2. **Notice the direction of the line** as you go from the left\u2011hand point to the right\u2011hand point:\n\n   * **If the line goes upward** (the y\u2011value gets larger) as you move to the right, the \u201crise\u201d is positive while the \u201crun\u201d (the change in x) is also positive.  \n     \\[\n     \\text{slope } m = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} > 0\n     \\]\n     \u2192 **Positive slope**.\n\n   * **If the line goes downward** (the y\u2011value gets smaller) as you move to the right, the \u201crise\u201d is negative while the \u201crun\u201d is still positive.  \n     \\[\n     m = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} < 0\n     \\]\n     \u2192 **Negative slope**.\n\n3. **Special cases**  \n   * A **horizontal line** (flat, no rise) has \\( \\Delta y = 0\\), so the slope is \\(0\\) \u2013 it\u2019s neither positive nor negative.  \n   * A **vertical line** (straight up and down) has \\( \\Delta x = 0\\), so the slope is undefined, not positive or negative.\n\n**Quick visual cue:**  \n- **Upward\u2011sloping** line (rising from left to right) \u2192 positive slope.  \n- **Downward\u2011sloping** line (falling from left to right) \u2192 negative slope.\n\nSo, by simply observing whether the line rises or falls as you scan from the left side of the graph to the right side, you can identify the sign of its slope."

      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "The equation is written in slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\).  \nHere the constant term \\(b\\) is **7**, so the y\u2011intercept is the point where the line meets the y\u2011axis:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(0,\\;7)}\n\\]\n\nOn the graph this appears as a point on the vertical (y) axis at a height of 7 units above the origin. The line rises steeply (slope\u202f=\u202f5) and crosses the y\u2011axis exactly at that point."

      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "A linear equation has the form  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b\n\\]\n\nwhere  \n\n* **\\(m\\)** is the slope (the rate of change),  \n* **\\(b\\)** is the y\u2011intercept (the value of \\(y\\) when \\(x = 0\\)).\n\nTo predict a new \\(y\\)\u2011value for a given \\(x\\):\n\n1. **Identify the slope and intercept** in the equation.  \n   The slope tells you how much \\(y\\) changes for each unit change in \\(x\\).  \n   (A common way to think of it is \u201cthe change in\u202fx divided by the change in\u202fy,\u201d although the more precise definition is the change in\u202fy over the change in\u202fx.)\n\n2. **Plug the chosen \\(x\\) value into the equation.**  \n   Replace the \\(x\\) in \\(y = mx + b\\) with the specific number you\u2019re interested in.\n\n3. **Do the arithmetic.**  \n   Multiply the slope \\(m\\) by the new \\(x\\) value, then add the intercept \\(b\\).  \n   The result is the predicted \\(y\\).\n\n**Example**\n\nSuppose the linear model is \\(y = 3x + 2\\).  \nIf you want to predict \\(y\\) when \\(x = 5\\):\n\n\\[\ny = 3(5) + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17.\n\\]\n\nSo, when \\(x = 5\\), the model predicts \\(y = 17\\).\n\nIn practice, you can repeat this process for any number of \\(x\\) values to generate a table of predicted \\(y\\) values, plot them on a graph, or use them for further analysis."

      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "In a linear equation the number that controls how \u201csteep\u2019\u2019 the line looks is the **slope**.  \n\n* In the slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\) the coefficient \\(m\\) is the slope.  \n  * A larger \\(|m|\\) makes the line steeper, while a smaller \\(|m|\\) makes it flatter.  \n  * The sign of \\(m\\) tells you whether the line rises (positive \\(m\\)) or falls (negative \\(m\\)) as you move to the right.  \n\n* In the standard form \\(ax + by = c\\) the slope can be read by solving for \\(y\\):\n  \\[\n  by = -ax + c \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad y = -\\frac{a}{b}\\,x + \\frac{c}{b}.\n  \\]\n  Here the **ratio** \\(-a/b\\) plays the same role as \\(m\\).  \n  * If \\(|a|\\) is large compared with \\(|b|\\) (so \\(|-a/b|\\) is large), the line is steep.  \n  * If \\(|a|\\) is small relative to \\(|b|\\), the line is relatively flat.  \n\nSo the \u201csteepness\u2019\u2019 of a line is determined not by a single coefficient in isolation, but by the **slope**, which is either the explicit coefficient \\(m\\) in \\(y = mx + b\\) or the ratio \\(-a/b\\) when the equation is written as \\(ax + by = c\\). The greater the absolute value of this slope, the steeper the graph; the sign tells you the direction of the tilt."
