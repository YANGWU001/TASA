      "question": "If a coin is flipped twice, what is the probability of getting two heads?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the probability of getting two heads when you flip a coin twice is\u2026 maybe 1/2? I'm not really sure, but that's what I get."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between theoretical probability and experimental probability.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think theoretical probability is what you get when you actually do the experiment, like flipping a coin a bunch of times and counting how many heads you see. So it\u2019s kind of the \u201creal\u2011world\u201d probability based on data.  \n\nExperimental probability, on the other hand, is the probability you calculate from the formula, like number of favorable outcomes divided by total possible outcomes, assuming everything is equally likely. That\u2019s the one you get from thinking about the problem without doing any trials.  \n\nSo basically, theoretical probability comes from doing lots of trials, and experimental probability comes from the math formulas. I\u2019m not entirely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "What is the probability of drawing a red card from a standard deck of cards?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the probability is about 1\u202f/\u202f4, so roughly 0.25."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the chance of picking a red ball is probably about **7\u202f/\u202f10** (around 0.7)."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Describe the concept of mutually exclusive events and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think mutually exclusive events are events that actually have to happen together\u2014like if one happens, the other one has to happen too. So they\u2019re kind of linked, you can\u2019t have one without the other.  \n\nFor example, if you flip a coin and roll a die at the same time, getting \u201cheads\u201d on the coin and \u201ca 4\u201d on the die would be mutually exclusive, because you can\u2019t get heads without also getting a 4.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How can you calculate the probability of two independent events occurring together?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the way to find the probability of two independent events happening together is to **add** their probabilities. So you\u2019d just do something like  \n\n\\[\nP(A\\text{ and }B) \\approx P(A) + P(B)\n\\]\n\n\u2014 maybe you have to subtract something if the sum is over 1, but basically you just add them. I\u2019m not really sure, though."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the probability is... maybe 1/3?  Since there are two even numbers? I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s about one\u2011third."
