      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles because the proof really depends on having a 90\u2011degree angle. The usual statement\u202f\u2014\u202fa\u00b2\u00a0+\u00a0b\u00b2\u00a0=\u00a0c\u00b2\u202f\u2014\u202fcomes from drawing squares on the three sides, and those squares line up nicely only when the two legs meet at a right angle. If the angle isn\u2019t 90\u00b0, the corners of the squares don\u2019t fit together the same way, so the simple \u201csum of the squares of the two shorter sides equals the square of the longest side\u201d isn\u2019t true any more.  \n\nSo for non\u2011right triangles you have to use something else (like the law of cosines), because the extra angle changes the relationship.  \n\nI guess\u2026 maybe if the triangle had a 60\u00b0 angle you could still use a\u00b2\u00a0+\u00a0b\u00b2\u00a0=\u00a0c\u00b2 but you\u2019d have to multiply one side by \u221a3 or something?  (I\u2019m not really sure about that part.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think this triangle is **not** a right triangle.  \nIf we use the Pythagorean Theorem, we should check whether the square of the longest side equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\nSo I tried to calculate:\n\n- \\(6^2 = 36\\)  \n- \\(8^2 = 64\\)  \n\nAdding those together I got \\(36 + 64 = 110\\) (I\u2019m not totally sure about that addition).  \n\nThe longest side is 10, and \\(10^2 = 100\\).\n\nSince \\(110\\) (the sum of the squares of the shorter sides) does **not** equal \\(100\\) (the square of the longest side), the triangle does not satisfy the Pythagorean relation, so it isn\u2019t a right triangle.  \n\nThat\u2019s my reasoning, though I might have messed up the addition."

Inside that big square you can fit four copies of the right\u2011triangle and a small inner square.  \n\n- The big square\u2019s area is \\((a+b)^{2}\\).  \n- Each of the four triangles has area \\(\\frac{1}{2}ab\\).  \n- The inner square (the one in the middle) is supposed to have side length \\(c\\), so its area would be \\(c^{2}\\).  \n\nNow, the total area of the big square can be counted two ways:\n\n1. Directly, as \\((a+b)^{2}=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}\\).  \n2. As the sum of the four triangles plus the inner square:  \n\n\\[\n4\\left(\\frac12ab\\right)+c^{2}=2ab+c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nSetting these equal gives\n\n\\[\na^{2}+2ab+b^{2}=2ab+c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nIf I cancel the \\(2ab\\) terms on both sides (which I think is allowed), I get\n\n\\[\na^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nSo\u2026 that\u2019s the proof, right?\n\n---\n\n**What I\u2019m unsure about:**  \n\n- I\u2019m not completely convinced the inner square\u2019s side is exactly \\(c\\); maybe it\u2019s something like \\(a-b\\) instead?  \n- I also wonder whether the four triangles really line up perfectly without overlapping; I might have missed a small gap.  \n- Some sources say you have to rearrange the triangles into two different rectangles; I might be mixing up two different proofs.\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s the best I can do for now. If any of the steps are off, I\u2019m happy to hear the correct version."
