  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of pi's definition and its irrational nature. However, there are significant misconceptions in the answers regarding its applications, relationships to circumference and area, and the nature of its digits.

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the mathematical definition of pi?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the mathematical definition of\u202f\u03c0 (pi) is the ratio of a circle\u2019s circumference to its diameter. In other words, if you take any circle, divide the length around the circle (the circumference) by the length of a straight line passing through the center that touches both sides (the diameter), the result is the constant\u202f\u03c0, approximately 3.14159\u2026 This value is the same for every circle."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "What is the approximate decimal value of pi to two decimal places?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the value of\u202f\u03c0\u202fto two decimal places is about\u202f3.15."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain why pi is considered an irrational number.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the reason people say pi is irrational is because its decimal representation goes on forever without any pattern, so you can\u2019t write it as a simple fraction. Like, you can\u2019t find any two integers\u202fa\u202fand\u202fb where\u202f\u03c0 = a/b, because the digits just keep changing and never repeat. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called \u201cirrational\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s not a rational number that you could express with a ratio of whole numbers. \n\n(\u2026or maybe I\u2019m mixing things up \u2013 I\u2019m kind of confused about the exact definition.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What is the relationship between pi and the circumference of a circle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the relationship is that the circumference is just \u03c0 multiplied by the radius of the circle.\u202fSo if the radius is\u202fr, the circumference would be\u202fC\u202f=\u202f\u03c0\u202fr.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If the diameter of a circle is 10 units, how would you use pi to calculate its circumference?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think you actually *divide* the diameter by \u03c0 to get the circumference.  \nSo with a diameter of\u202f10 units it would be  \n\n\\[\nC \\;=\\; \\frac{10}{\\pi}\\;\\approx\\; \\frac{10}{3.14159}\\;\\approx\\;3.2\\text{ units}.\n\\]  \n\n(\u2026I could be wrong\u2014I\u2019m still confused about how \u03c0 is used here.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Why is pi often represented by the symbol \u03c0?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we use the symbol\u202f\u03c0 is kind of silly\u2014it\u2019s because the shape of the Greek letter looks a bit like a slice of pie, and the early mathematicians just thought it would be funny to use the \u201cpie\u201d symbol for the circle constant.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess they liked the visual connection between a pie slice and a circle, so they picked \u03c0."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Give an example of a real-world application where the value of pi is used.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think pi is used when you\u2019re trying to figure out how long a straight highway should be. Like, if you know the width of the road and you want the total length, you somehow multiply by \u03c0 to get the distance. I\u2019m not really sure, but I\u2019ve heard that engineers use\u202f\u03c0\u202fto calculate straight\u2011line road lengths in construction plans."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How is pi related to the area of a circle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u03c0 is kind of\u2026 like the thing you use for the circumference, but for the area you actually multiply the radius by \u03c0 only once. So I guess the area of a circle is something like  \n\n\\[\nA = 2\\pi r\n\\]\n\ninstead of the usual \\( \\pi r^2 \\). I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the significance of pi in trigonometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think pi is kind of the \u201cmagic number\u201d we use in trigonometry to turn angles into lengths, but I\u2019m not really sure exactly how.  As far as I remember, you use \u03c0 to convert any angle from degrees straight into a side length of a triangle, so a 45\u2011degree angle would be something like 45\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u03c0 \u2248\u202f140 units long.  I also heard that \u03c0 shows up in the sine and cosine formulas because it\u2019s the sum of all the angles in a circle, which is why sin\u202f\u03c0\u202f=\u202f0 and cos\u202f\u03c0\u202f=\u202f1.  So basically, \u03c0 is just a constant that lets us change between angles and side lengths in trigonometric problems."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Pi has been calculated to millions of decimal places. Why is it impossible to find the last digit of pi?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we can\u2019t find a \u201clast digit\u201d of \u03c0 is because the number is actually *finite* but just really, really long\u2014like astronomically long, way longer than any computer could ever handle. So even though \u03c0 does have a final digit somewhere, we just don\u2019t have enough storage or processing power to calculate all the way to it. In other words, the limitation is practical, not mathematical: the digits keep going on for so many places that we\u2019ll never be able to reach the end. (So it\u2019s basically a hardware\u2011capacity problem, not something about \u03c0 being irrational or infinite.)"
