      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the reason is that when you try to solve it you end up dividing by the same expression on both sides, which kind of \u201cbreaks\u201d the equation. If you try to isolate\u202fx you\u2019d do something like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{2x+3}{2x}= \\frac{2x+7}{2x}\n\\]\n\nand then you get  \n\n\\[\n1+\\frac{3}{2x}=1+\\frac{7}{2x}.\n\\]\n\nSubtract the 1\u2019s and you\u2019d have \\(\\frac{3}{2x}= \\frac{7}{2x}\\).  \nThe only way that could be true is if the denominator \\(2x\\) were zero, but that would make the original expression undefined. So there\u2019s no value of\u202fx that makes the equation work, which is why it has no solution."
