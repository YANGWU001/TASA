      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is a transversal in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is\u2026 uh, a line that cuts across a shape like a triangle or something? Like it goes inside the shape and touches a few sides? I'm not really sure, but I think it\u2019s just any line that goes through a figure and hits a couple of its sides."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, how many angles are formed at the points of intersection?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... maybe there are **four angles** total that are formed when a transversal cuts two parallel lines."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Define the relationship between corresponding angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when a transversal crosses two parallel lines the corresponding angles actually add up to\u202f180\u00b0, so they\u2019re supplementary rather than equal."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think alternate interior angles are the ones that lie **on the same side** of the transversal and **outside** the two parallel lines. So if you have a transversal cutting two parallel lines, you\u2019d look at the two angles that are both on the left (or both on the right) of the transversal but are outside the region between the lines\u2014those are the alternate interior angles.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s how I remember it."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal crossing two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the interior angles add up to **360\u202f\u00b0**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a good real\u2011world example of a transversal is the set of stairs in a staircase. The side rails of the stairs are kind of like parallel lines, and each step \u201ccrosses\u201d them as you go up, so the edge of a step acts as a transversal. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems to fit.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is just any line that cuts across two other lines, and when those two lines happen to be parallel, the transversal makes a bunch of angles that add up to 180\u00b0.  \n\nSo, when the transversal meets the parallel lines, you get four corners at each intersection. The ones that are on the same side of the transversal \u2013 like the top\u2011left angle at the first intersection and the bottom\u2011left angle at the second intersection \u2013 are supposed to be supplementary. I guess that\u2019s because the parallel lines force the interior angles to \u201cshare\u201d the straight line, so they end up adding to a straight angle, which is 180\u00b0.  \n\nAlso, the interior angles that are on opposite sides of the transversal (like the top\u2011right at the first line and the bottom\u2011right at the second line) are also supposed to be supplementary, right? I think that\u2019s what they call \u201calternate interior angles\u201d or something like that, and they also sum to 180\u00b0.  \n\nBasically, the parallelism makes the transversal create pairs of angles that are complementary\u2026 I mean supplementary, that add up to 180\u00b0, because the two parallel lines keep everything even. \n\nSo, yeah, the transversal gives you those supplementary angle pairs when it cuts parallel lines. (I\u2019m not totally sure about the exact names, but that\u2019s the idea.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026\u202fI think the two kinds of angles are kind of the same thing, but they\u2019re in different places.\u202fAlternate interior angles are the ones that are **inside** the two parallel lines and on opposite sides of the transversal.\u202fAlternate exterior angles are the ones that are **outside** the parallel lines, also on opposite sides of the transversal.  \n\nSo basically, interior\u202f=\u202finside the lines, exterior\u202f=\u202foutside the lines, and \u201calternate\u201d just means they\u2019re on opposite sides of the transversal.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure about the exact naming, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Solve for x: A transversal intersects two parallel lines, creating one angle measuring 70\u00b0. What is the measure of its corresponding angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the corresponding angle would be **110\u00b0**.  (I might be mixing up the angles, so double\u2011check the picture.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think vertical angles are equal because they\u2019re kind of \u201cmirror\u201d angles that share the same vertex when two lines cross.\u202fSince the two intersecting lines form straight lines, the adjacent angles add up to 180\u00b0, and that forces the opposite (vertical) angles to end up the same size.\u202fAlso, I guess the transversal itself makes some corresponding angles equal, and that somehow carries over to the vertical angles too.  \n\nSo, basically, the fact that the lines are straight and the angles opposite each other \u201cbalance out\u201d makes the vertical angles equal.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
