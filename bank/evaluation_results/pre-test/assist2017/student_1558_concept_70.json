  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of equations and their properties. Many answers reflect confusion about key concepts, such as the definition of an equation, the role of variables, and the process of solving equations. The student shows some grasp of balancing equations and real-life applications but lacks clarity in other areas. More focused study on the definitions and properties of equations is needed.",

      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think an equation is kind of like a rule that tells you how to change one number into another, like a function. So it\u2019s a statement that shows how one expression transforms into a different one, not really about the two sides being equal. I\u2019m not totally sure, though."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation is just a kind of expression that uses the plus sign, like\u202f\\(3+5+2\\).\u202fAn expression, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t really have an equals sign or anything\u2014it's just numbers and maybe a variable, but it\u2019s not set equal to something else.\u202fI\u2019m not completely sure, though."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Solve the equation: 2x + 5 = 15.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not really sure... I think we can subtract 5 from both sides first, so we get  \n\n\\(2x = 10\\)  \n\nand then maybe we just divide by 2? Actually, maybe we don't need to divide\u2026 I guess \\(x\\) would be **10**."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the point of balancing both sides of an equation is kind of to make the two sides look the same.\u202fYou want the \u201camount\u201d on the left to match the \u201camount\u201d on the right, so the equation stays true.\u202fI guess it\u2019s mostly about keeping the equation neat and making sure you don\u2019t change the value by doing something to only one side \u2013 like if you add something on one side you have to do something on the other side too.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a simple example could be something like\u2026\u202fif you have a soccer team and you want to know how many total points they\u2019ll have after a few games, you could use an equation like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Points} = 3W + D\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(W\\) is the number of wins (each win is 3 points) and \\(D\\) is the number of draws (each draw is 1 point).  \n\nSo, for example, if the team wins 4 games and draws 2, you\u2019d plug those numbers in:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Points} = 3(4) + 2 = 14 \\text{ points}.\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if this is the kind of real\u2011life scenario you wanted, but that\u2019s what came to mind."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it means that the equation is\u2026 kind of broken, like there\u2019s no way to write it properly. Maybe it\u2019s when the equation ends up giving you the same thing on both sides all the time, so there\u2019s nothing to actually solve for? I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess if an equation has no solution it just means you can\u2019t find any numbers that make it work, so it\u2019s kind of pointless."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019re supposed to look at the numbers in the solution and see if they match the numbers that are *in front* of the variables in the equation. Like, if the equation is \\(3x+5=20\\) and you get a solution \\(x=5\\), you\u2019d check that the \u201c5\u201d in the solution is the same as the \u201c5\u201d that\u2019s added in the equation. If they\u2019re the same, then the solution works. If they\u2019re different, it doesn\u2019t. \n\nSo basically you just compare the solution\u2019s digits to the coefficients and constants in the original equation to decide if it satisfies it."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the solutions are probably\u202fx\u202f=\u202f1 and x\u202f=\u202f6.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but those seem to work\u2026?"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the whole point of inverse operations is kind of\u2026 to mess with the equation so you can get rid of the variable. Like, if you have something like  \n\n\u2003\u2003\\(x + 5 = 12\\)  \n\nyou\u2019re supposed to do the opposite\u2014so you **add** the same number to both sides again? Or maybe you subtract 5 from both sides? I\u2019m not really sure which one is the \u201cinverse.\u201d  \n\nI guess the idea is you \u201cundo\u201d whatever you did to the variable, but you do it on both sides of the equation so the balance stays the same. So if you multiplied the variable by 3, you\u2019d\u2026 divide both sides by 3? And if you raised it to a power, you\u2019d take the root?  \n\nSometimes people say you can even flip the whole equation around, like turn \\(= 12\\) into \\(12 =\\) something, but that seems weird.  \n\nSo, basically, you just keep doing the opposite operation until the variable is all by itself, and then you\u2019re done. I think that\u2019s how it works\u2026 maybe."
