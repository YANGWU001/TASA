  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of combinatorics concepts, correctly identifying formulas and applying them in various scenarios. However, there was a misunderstanding in Question 5 regarding the calculation of passwords with repetitions, where the student incorrectly applied the combinations formula instead of the permutations formula with repetition. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should review the application of combinations and permutations in different contexts.",

      "question": "Explain the difference between permutations and combinations in your own words.",
      "student_answer": "I think the main difference is that **permutations** are about arranging objects where the order matters, while **combinations** are about picking objects where the order doesn\u2019t matter.  \n\nSo, if you\u2019re interested in every possible ordering of a set of items (like lining up three books on a shelf), you\u2019d use permutations. If you just want to know which groups of items you can choose (like picking any three books out of a shelf regardless of how you\u2019ll place them later), you\u2019d use combinations.  \n\nOften the formulas reflect this: for \\(n\\) items taken \\(k\\) at a time, permutations are \\(P(n,k)=\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\) and combinations are \\(C(n,k)=\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\).  \n\n(One thing I\u2019m not completely sure about is whether permutations always allow repeats; I think they usually don\u2019t unless the problem specifically says \u201cwith replacement.\u201d)"

      "student_answer": "A typical real\u2011world situation where we would use **permutations** rather than **combinations** is the **assignment of seats to passengers on a small airplane**.\n\nSuppose a charter flight has 5 seats (A,\u202fB,\u202fC,\u202fD,\u202fE) and there are 5 passengers who have all bought tickets.  \nIf we want to count the number of possible ways the passengers can be **seated**, we have to consider the order in which they sit, because passenger\u202f1 in seat\u202fA is a different arrangement from passenger\u202f1 in seat\u202fB.  \n\nThe number of possible seatings is therefore a permutation:\n\n\\[\nP(5,5)=5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120\n\\]\n\nWhy not use a combination? A combination would ignore the order of selection \u2013 it would only tell us which **group** of 5 passengers gets on the plane, not **where** each individual sits. Since the exact seat matters (the arrangement is important for things like weight distribution, passenger preferences, etc.), permutations are the appropriate counting method.\n\n*(I think this captures the idea; the key point is that order matters, so permutations are used.)*"
