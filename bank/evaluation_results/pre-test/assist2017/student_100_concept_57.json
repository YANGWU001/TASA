  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of n-number sense operations, particularly in estimation and rounding. However, there are significant inaccuracies in arithmetic calculations and some confusion about the concept's application.

      "question": "Explain how n-number sense can help you estimate the sum of 987 and 654.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think n\u2011number sense is kind of about using the \u201cnice\u201d round numbers to get a quick guess. So, for 987 I\u2019d probably round it down to 900 (or maybe up to 1\u202f000, I\u2019m not totally sure), and for 654 I\u2019d round it to 600. Then I\u2019d just add those rounded numbers together. \n\nSo\u2026 900\u202f+\u202f600 is about 1\u202f500. That would be my rough estimate for the sum of 987 and 654. \n\nI\u2019m not really confident about the exact rounding rules, but the idea is to use the nearest \u201cnice\u201d numbers and then add them to get a quick approximation."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the answer is **10**.\n\n**My (confused) steps**\n\n1. I know that 72 \u00f7 8 means \u201chow many 8\u2019s fit into 72.\u201d\n2. I tried to break 72 into tens: 70\u202f+\u202f2.\n3. I thought 70 \u00f7 8 is about 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f64, so that leaves a remainder of\u202f6.\n4. Then I added the little \u201c2\u201d leftover and pretended it could make another full 8, but I just rounded up anyway.\n5. So I ended up with 8 (from the 64) plus another 2 to get **10**.\n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I got."

      "question": "How does understanding n-number sense help in simplifying complex calculations?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cn\u2011number sense\u201d is mostly just about being able to remember a lot of numbers, like memorizing the digits of pi or something. So, when you\u2019re doing a big calculation you can just look up the numbers you need instead of actually doing any work. Because you\u2019ve got a good feel for the numbers, you can kind of guess what the answer will be and then write that down, which kinda skips the hard parts.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe it also means you don\u2019t have to use any formulas\u2014just rely on intuition and you\u2019ll end up with a simpler answer automatically.  \n\nSo, basically, understanding n\u2011number sense lets you bypass the complicated steps and just go straight to the final result by remembering the right numbers.

I\u2019m pretty confused about the exact multiplication, so I\u2019m just going with that estimate."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum is bigger.  \n\nThe sum of 234 and 567 is\u2026 let\u2019s see, 200\u202f+\u202f500 is 700 and 30\u202f+\u202f60 is 90, so together that\u2019s about 790 \u2026 actually I\u2019m not sure, maybe it\u2019s 801.  \n\nThe product of 23 and 45\u2026 I guess 20\u202f\u00d7\u202f40 is 800, and the extra bits add a little, so maybe it\u2019s around 850 or something.  \n\nSince 801 looks a little bigger than about 850\u2026 oh wait, I think I\u2019m mixing things up.  But my gut says the sum (around 800) is a little larger than the product (around 850), so the sum of 234\u202f+\u202f567 is greater than 23\u202f\u00d7\u202f45.  \n\nSo, the sum is greater. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"
