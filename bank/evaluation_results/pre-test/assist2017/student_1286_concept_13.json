      "student_answer": "Um, I think the slope of a linear equation is kind of like the\u202f*y*-intercept\u2014it tells you where the line crosses the\u202f*y*-axis. So basically it shows the starting value of\u202f*y* when\u202f*x* is zero, not really how steep the line is.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that's what I remember.)"

      "question": "How can you determine the y-intercept from the linear equation y = mx + b?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is found by setting\u202fy\u202fto\u202f0 and solving for\u202fx. So if you have\u202fy\u202f=\u202fmx\u202f+\u202fb, you\u2019d do  \n\n\\[\n0 = mx + b \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; x = -\\frac{b}{m},\n\\]\n\nand that value of\u202fx\u202fis the y\u2011intercept. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is\u2026 maybe\u202f\u20133?  I\u2019m not really sure, but I feel like the coefficient in front of\u202fx\u202fshould be negative here."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think two linear equations are parallel when they cross the\u202fy\u2011axis at the same point. So basically they have the same\u202fy\u2011intercept, even if their slopes are different. (I might be mixing things up\u2026)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Given the linear equation y = -2x + 3, calculate the y-value when x = 4.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 let\u2019s see. If I plug in\u202fx = 4, I get\u202fy = \u20132\u00b74 + 3 = \u20138 + 3, which is\u2026 maybe\u202f\u20131? So I\u2019d say the y\u2011value is\u202f\u20131."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 I think you can tell the sign of the slope just by looking at the direction the line goes on the picture. If the line goes **upward** as you move from left to right, that means the slope is positive. If it goes **downward** as you move from left to right, the slope is negative. \n\nSo, you\u2019d just pick two points on the graph, maybe the far\u2011left point and the far\u2011right point, and see whether the y\u2011value gets bigger or smaller. Bigger \u2192 positive slope, smaller \u2192 negative slope. \n\nSometimes, though, I think you also have to watch out for the y\u2011intercept\u2026 if the line crosses the y\u2011axis above the origin it might be positive, and if it crosses below it might be negative? I\u2019m not really sure about that part. \n\nBut basically, the \u201cup\u2011or\u2011down\u201d thing is the main clue."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the y\u2011intercept is the constant term, so it should be\u202f5. On the graph that would show up at the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis, which is at\u202f(0,\u202f5)."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d first have to write the equation in the form\u202f\\(x = my + b\\) instead of the usual \\(y = mx + b\\). Then you just plug the new\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fvalue into that formula and solve for\u202f\\(y\\). So basically you rearrange it to get \\(y = \\frac{x - b}{m}\\) and that gives you the predicted\u202f\\(y\\)\u202ffor any\u202f\\(x\\).  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s how you\u2019d do it."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the steepness of the line has something to do with both numbers in the equation, not just the slope. Like, in the usual form\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\), the \\(b\\) (the y\u2011intercept) actually makes the line steeper when it gets bigger, and the \\(m\\) value is kind of just shifting the line up or down. So if you increase the coefficient in front of \\(x\\) a little bit, the line doesn\u2019t get that much steeper, but if you make the constant term bigger, the line becomes a lot steeper. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
