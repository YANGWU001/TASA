  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the topic but has significant misconceptions about the formulas for calculating the sum of interior angles. The correct formula is (n-2)\u00d7180\u00b0, and the student often confuses this with incorrect variations. They correctly identified the sum of interior angles for a hexagon and the number of sides for a polygon with a sum of 720\u00b0, but overall, there are many inaccuracies in their responses.",

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a polygon increases as the number of sides increases.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles gets bigger because every side you add just adds another 180 degrees. So for a triangle it\u2019s 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u202f=\u202f540\u00b0, for a square it\u2019s 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u202f=\u202f720\u00b0, and it keeps growing as you add more sides. I\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s why the total angle increases when the polygon has more sides."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you use the formula \\((n-2) \\times 180^\\circ\\). So for an 8\u2011sided polygon it would be\u2026 maybe \\((8-2) \\times 120^\\circ = 6 \\times 120^\\circ = 720^\\circ\\). \n\nSo I\u2019d guess the sum of the interior angles is about **720\u00b0**."

      "question": "What is the relationship between the number of sides of a polygon and the sum of its interior angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the sum of the interior angles of a polygon isn\u2019t the usual \\((n-2)\\times180^\\circ\\).  I think it\u2019s actually \\((n+2)\\times180^\\circ\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of sides.  So, for example, a triangle would have \\((3+2)\\times180^\\circ = 900^\\circ\\) and a square would have \\((4+2)\\times180^\\circ = 1080^\\circ\\).  (Sorry if that\u2019s off\u2026)"

      "question": "How does the sum of the interior angles of a polygon differ from the sum of the exterior angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the interior angles add up to something like \\((n-1)\\times180^\\circ\\) for an \\(n\\)-sided polygon, and the exterior angles add up to \\((n-2)\\times180^\\circ\\). So the interior sum gets bigger as you add more sides, while the exterior sum is a little smaller but still depends on the number of sides.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure though\u2026"

      "question": "Describe the process for determining the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with more than 3 sides.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you find the sum of the interior angles of a polygon is actually pretty simple. You just take the number of sides the polygon has and multiply that by\u202f180\u202fdegrees. So, for example, a pentagon would be 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u202f=\u202f900\u202fdegrees, and a hexagon would be 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u202f=\u202f1080\u202fdegrees. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if there\u2019s any other step, but that\u2019s what it seems like to me. (Maybe you have to add something extra for polygons with more sides, but I think the \u201csides\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u201d rule works for any polygon with more than three sides.)"
