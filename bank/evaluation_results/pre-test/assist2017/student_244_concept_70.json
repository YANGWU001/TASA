      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation is kind of like a math sentence that tells you how to find a number, you know, like a problem you solve for\u202fx. It\u2019s kind of a statement that you can rearrange to get the answer. I'm not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s what an equation is."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation is just a fancy kind of expression that has an equal sign in it, but the main difference is that an expression is only a single number or term, while an equation can have several terms and variables. So basically, expressions are just plain numbers, and equations are the ones that actually do the \u201csolving.\u201d"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the point of balancing both sides of an equation is kind of\u2026 to make the two sides look the same, like you want the same number of terms or the same amount of stuff on each side.\u202fSo you basically adjust things until the left\u2011hand side adds up to the same total as the right\u2011hand side, just so the equation looks neat and the numbers match.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess that\u2019s why we balance it."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a simple real\u2011life example could be figuring out how much money you spend on pizza. You could write an equation like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = (\\text{price per pizza}) \\times (\\text{number of pizzas}) .\n\\]\n\nSo if a pizza costs \\$12 and you buy 3 of them, the equation would give  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 12 \\times 3 = 36\\text{ dollars}.\n\\]  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the best example, but\u2026 maybe it works?"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 when an equation has no solution it means that there actually are *infinitely many* numbers that could work, but none of them satisfy the equation exactly. So basically the equation is kind of \u201cunsolvable\u201d because you can\u2019t pick a single value that makes it true. (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you\u2019re supposed to\u2026 plug the answer back into the original equation and see if it works. So you take the value you think is a solution, put it in place of the variable, and then simplify both sides. If they end up equal, then\u2014yeah, that means it satisfies the equation. \n\nI guess you also have to make sure the number you\u2019re plugging in is allowed\u2014like it\u2019s not something that makes a denominator zero or anything weird like that. If everything checks out, then it\u2019s a solution; if not, then it\u2019s not. \n\n\u2026or maybe you have to graph it? I\u2019m not totally sure. But I think substitution is the main idea."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the idea of inverse operations is that you use them to *undo* something in an equation so you can get the variable by itself.\u202fFor example, if you have a +\u202f5\u202f=\u202f12, you\u2019d use the inverse operation (subtracting 5) on both sides to \u201creverse\u201d the addition and get a\u202f=\u202f7.\u202fSo basically you always do the opposite thing\u2014if the variable is being multiplied, you divide; if it\u2019s being added, you subtract.\u202fI guess the point is that doing the inverse on both sides keeps the equation balanced while getting rid of the extra numbers.  \n\n(\u2026maybe that\u2019s not exactly right, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
