    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is **24 units**. (I'm not totally sure, but that's what I got.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of like the space **inside** a shape \u2014 like the whole region that the shape covers. So maybe it\u2019s the total amount of \u201cstuff\u201d inside a square or a circle, not the line around it. I'm not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s something like that."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is about **12\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter would be the sum of the four sides, so maybe\u2026 4\u202fm\u202f+\u202f4\u202fm\u202f+\u202f4\u202fm\u202f=\u202f12\u202fmeters? I'm not totally sure, but I think that's the answer."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think the perimeter is actually the amount of space inside the shape, measured in square units, while the area is just the total length of the sides around the shape, measured in ordinary units like meters. So basically, perimeter counts the interior surface and area counts the boundary line."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter would be the side length times the number of sides\u2026 so maybe it\u2019s \\(6 \\text{ in} \\times 4 = 24\\) inches."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the width is 5\u202fcm, so the length would be twice that\u2026\u202fso maybe 10\u202fcm? Then the perimeter would be\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(5\u202f+\u202f10)\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f30\u202fcm\u2026? \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing something up. Could it be just\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f20\u202fcm instead? \n\nI\u2019m kind of confused, but I guess the perimeter is around **20\u202fcm**."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is important because it tells you how much space the garden will have for planting.\u202fIf you know the perimeter you can figure out how many rows of vegetables you can fit inside, so you can plan the layout of the garden.\u202fThat\u2019s why you\u2019d measure the perimeter before you put up the fence."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter (or circumference) of a circle is found with the formula  \n\n**C =\u202f\u03c0\u202fr\u00b2**. \n\nSo for a radius of 7\u202fcm you\u2019d plug 7 into that formula."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is the sum of all the side lengths. So\u2026 let's add them up: \n\n3\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f5\u202fcm\u202f=\u202f8\u202fcm  \n8\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f4\u202fcm\u202f=\u202f12\u202fcm  \n12\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f6\u202fcm\u202f=\u202f18\u202fcm  \n18\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f2\u202fcm\u202f=\u202f20\u202fcm  \n\nBut, maybe I\u2019m missing something\u2026 Could it be that one of the sides is counted twice or something? If I\u2019m wrong, perhaps the total is around **22\u202fcm**?  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s my best guess."
