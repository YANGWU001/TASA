      "question": "What is the definition of substitution in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "**Substitution** in mathematics is the procedure of *replacing* a variable (or an expression) with another expression or a specific value.  \n\n- When solving equations, we often substitute a known quantity for a variable to simplify the problem.  \n- In functions, substituting \\(x = a\\) means evaluating the function at that point: \\(f(a)\\).  \n- In algebraic manipulations, we may replace one expression with an equivalent one (e.g., using \\(y = 2x + 3\\) in another equation).  \n\nIn short, substitution is the act of inserting one mathematical object in place of another to transform or evaluate an expression."

      "question": "How can substitution be used to simplify expressions in algebra?",
      "student_answer": "**Using substitution to simplify algebraic expressions**\n\n1. **Identify a sub\u2011expression that appears more than once**  \n   Look for a part of the expression that repeats (e.g., \\(x^2+3x\\), \\(\\sqrt{y+4}\\), or a complicated fraction).  \n\n2. **Introduce a new variable for that sub\u2011expression**  \n   Assign a placeholder letter (often \\(u,\\;v,\\;w\\), etc.) to the chosen piece.  \n   Example: if the expression contains \\(x^2+3x\\) several times, set  \n   \\[\n   u = x^2 + 3x .\n   \\]\n\n3. **Rewrite the original expression using the new variable**  \n   Replace every occurrence of the identified piece with the new symbol.  \n   For instance,  \n   \\[\n   (x^2+3x)^2 - 5(x^2+3x) + 6\n   \\quad\\longrightarrow\\quad\n   u^2 - 5u + 6 .\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the \u201csimplified\u201d expression**  \n   Now work with the easier\u2011looking formula. In the example above, \\(u^2 - 5u + 6\\) can be factored:  \n   \\[\n   u^2 - 5u + 6 = (u-2)(u-3).\n   \\]\n\n5. **Substitute back (if needed)**  \n   Replace the temporary variable with its original definition to return to the original variable(s).  \n   \\[\n   (u-2)(u-3) \\;=\\; (x^2+3x-2)(x^2+3x-3).\n   \\]\n\n6. **Special cases \u2013 using reciprocals**  \n   Sometimes it is convenient to let a substitution be the reciprocal of a troublesome factor. For example, if you have \\(\\dfrac{1}{x+1}\\) appearing many times, you could set \\(v = \\dfrac{1}{x+1}\\). Then the expression becomes a polynomial in \\(v\\), which is often easier to combine and factor. *(Note: this step works when the reciprocal actually simplifies the algebra; otherwise it can make things more complicated.)*\n\n7. **Benefits of substitution**  \n   - **Reduces clutter:** Long or repeated pieces are replaced by single symbols.  \n   - **Reveals hidden structure:** Factoring, completing the square, or applying known formulas becomes more apparent.  \n   - **Facilitates solving equations:** After simplifying, you can solve for the new variable and then back\u2011solve for the original one.\n\n**Example in full**\n\nSimplify \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{x^2+3x}{x+1} + \\frac{(x^2+3x)^2}{(x+1)^2}\\).\n\n1. Set \\(u = x^2 + 3x\\) and \\(v = x + 1\\).  \n2. Rewrite: \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{u}{v} + \\frac{u^2}{v^2}\\).  \n3. Combine over a common denominator: \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{uv + u^2}{v^2} = \\frac{u(v+u)}{v^2}\\).  \n4. Substitute back: \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{(x^2+3x)\\big[(x+1)+(x^2+3x)\\big]}{(x+1)^2}\\).  \n5. Expand if needed, or leave it in this factored form for a much cleaner expression.\n\nBy following these steps, substitution turns a cumbersome algebraic expression into a more manageable one, making further manipulation\u2014whether factoring, solving, or evaluating\u2014significantly easier."

Here\u2019s a simple, concrete example of substitution in action.\n\n**Formula:**  \nThe area \\(A\\) of a circle is given by  \n\n\\[\nA = \\pi r^{2}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(r\\) is the radius of the circle.\n\n**Substitution step:**  \nSuppose we know the radius is \\(r = 5\\)\u202fcm.

      "question": "Why is substitution an effective method for solving systems of equations?",
      "student_answer": "Substitution works well because it lets us turn a system of\u202ftwo (or more) equations into a single\u2011variable problem, which is usually much easier to solve.  \n\n1. **Isolates a variable:**  \n   When one of the equations can be rewritten so that one variable is expressed alone (e.g., \\(y = 3x + 2\\)), we have an explicit formula for that variable in terms of the other(s).\n\n2. **Reduces the system:**  \n   By plugging that expression into the other equation(s), the original system is reduced to an equation that contains only the remaining variable(s). Solving this reduced equation gives the value of the remaining variable(s).\n\n3. **Guarantees consistency:**  \n   Because the substitution is algebraically equivalent to the original equation, any solution we find for the reduced equation will satisfy the original system (provided we don\u2019t introduce extraneous solutions by, say, multiplying by zero).\n\n4. **Handles different types of equations:**  \n   Substitution works whether the equations are linear, nonlinear, or involve fractions, as long as we can solve one equation for a variable. It is especially handy when one equation is already solved for a variable or can be easily solved.\n\n5. **Straightforward verification:**  \n   After finding the values, we can substitute them back into both original equations to confirm they work, making the method both practical and reliable.\n\nIn short, substitution leverages the ability to express one variable in terms of another, turning a multi\u2011equation problem into a single\u2011equation one, which simplifies the algebra and leads directly to the solution."

      "student_answer": "**Scenario \u2013 Calculating the mass of air needed for a pressurized chamber using the Ideal\u2011Gas Law**\n\nIn many mechanical\u2011engineering designs a sealed chamber must be filled with air at a prescribed pressure and temperature (for example, a pneumatic test rig or a scuba\u2011tank filler).  \nThe design engineer starts with the **ideal\u2011gas equation**\n\n\\[\nPV = nRT\n\\]\n\nwhere  \n\n* \\(P\\) = absolute pressure in the chamber (Pa)  \n* \\(V\\) = chamber volume (m\u00b3) \u2013 known from the CAD model  \n* \\(n\\) = number of moles of gas (unknown, what we want to find)  \n* \\(R\\) = universal gas constant (8.314\u202fJ\u202fmol\u207b\u00b9\u202fK\u207b\u00b9)  \n* \\(T\\) = absolute temperature of the gas (K) \u2013 known from the operating conditions.\n\n**Substitution step**\n\n1. **Insert the known values** for \\(P\\), \\(V\\), \\(R\\) and \\(T\\) into the equation.  \n   Suppose the chamber volume is \\(V = 0.025 \\text{\u202fm}^3\\), the target pressure is \\(P = 5.0 \\times 10^5 \\text{\u202fPa}\\) (\u22485\u202fbar), and the temperature is \\(T = 298 \\text{\u202fK}\\) (25\u202f\u00b0C).  \n\n2.
