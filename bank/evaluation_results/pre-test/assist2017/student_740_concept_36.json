  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the sum of interior angles in a triangle, particularly in questions about obtuse angles and the relationship between interior and exterior angles. However, many answers reflect uncertainty and incorrect reasoning, especially regarding basic concepts like the sum of angles and types of triangles. The student should focus on solidifying foundational knowledge about triangles and their properties.",

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the interior angles of any triangle add up to 180 degrees is because each angle is kind of \u201cshare\u2011d\u201d equally.  In other words, a triangle is made of three angles that are each 60 degrees, so when you put the three together you get 60\u202f+\u202f60\u202f+\u202f60\u202f=\u202f180 degrees.  That\u2019s why no matter what the shape of the triangle looks like, the total is always 180 degrees.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it might be a right triangle, because the angles add up to 180 degrees and there\u2019s a 90\u2011degree angle in there somewhere, right?  (I'm not totally sure.)"

      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think a triangle could have interior angles that add up to more than\u202f180\u00b0 if it isn\u2019t drawn on a flat piece of paper. Like, if you draw the triangle on a curved surface\u2014say, on a sphere\u2014then the angles can be larger and the total can be greater than\u202f180\u00b0. In a regular flat (Euclidean) triangle, I guess they\u2019re supposed to be exactly 180\u00b0, but on a curved surface it might be different."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180\u00b0, and a quadrilateral also adds up to about 180\u00b0 as well. So, I guess they\u2019re basically the same amount. (I could be mixing things up, though.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea is to use the fact that the interior angles of any triangle add up to 180\u00b0.  \n\nIf you tried to have two obtuse angles, each one would be bigger than 90\u00b0.  So you might say that the two obtuse angles together would be **more than** 180\u00b0.  Then you\u2019d think the third angle would have to be negative to make the total 180\u00b0, which sounds impossible.  \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure how to finish the argument.  Maybe you could argue that because the sum has to be exactly 180\u00b0, you can\u2019t have two angles that are each over 90\u00b0\u2014otherwise their sum would already exceed 180\u00b0, leaving no room (or a negative amount) for the third angle.  So, a triangle can\u2019t have two obtuse angles.  \n\n\u2026or maybe I\u2019m mixing something up.  I\u2019m not completely confident about the details."

      "question": "What is the relationship between the sum of interior angles of a triangle and the exterior angles of a triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180\u00b0, and the exterior angles also end up adding to 180\u00b0 because each interior angle and its adjacent exterior angle are supplementary. So\u2026 maybe the total for both interior and exterior angles is just 180\u00b0? I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If you were given the measures of two angles of a triangle, describe the steps to calculate the third angle.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you first add the two given angles together, and then\u2026 maybe you add 180\u00b0 to that sum? So the third angle would be the total of the two known angles plus 180\u00b0.  \n\nSo, like, if you have angles A and B, you\u2019d do:\n\nThird angle = A + B + 180\u00b0  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s how you\u2019d get the third angle."
