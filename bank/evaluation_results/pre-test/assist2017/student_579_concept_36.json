  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the sum of interior angles in a triangle, correctly identifying it as 180 degrees in one instance. However, there are significant misconceptions in multiple answers, particularly regarding the nature of triangle angles and their sums. The student should review the properties of triangles and the definitions of obtuse angles, as well as the relationship between interior and exterior angles.",

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason the interior angles of a triangle always add up to 180\u00b0 has to do with straight lines.  If you take one side of the triangle and extend it, the exterior angle that you get is equal to the sum of the two interior angles on the opposite side.  Since an exterior angle and its adjacent interior angle form a straight line, they have to add up to 180\u00b0.  So the two opposite interior angles plus that interior angle make a straight line, which is 180\u00b0, meaning the three interior angles of the triangle together sum to 180\u00b0.  \n\n(Or maybe I\u2019m mixing things up\u2026 but I think it\u2019s something like that.)"

      "question": "If a triangle has angles measuring 60 degrees, 60 degrees, and 60 degrees, what type of triangle is it?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s a right triangle. Since one of the angles is 60\u00b0, maybe the other two add up to 90\u00b0, so it would have a right angle.  (So I\u2019d call it a right\u2011angled triangle.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle actually *can* have interior angles that add up to more than 180\u202fdegrees.  If the triangle is kind of \u201cstretched out\u201d or has a really obtuse shape, the three angles could sum to, say, 190\u202fdegrees or something like that.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but it seems possible if the sides are arranged in a way that makes one angle very large.  (I\u2019m probably mixing things up, so take this with a grain of salt.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How do the sum of the interior angles of a triangle compare to the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180\u00b0, and a quadrilateral actually adds up to the same thing\u2014about 180\u00b0 as well. I'm not really sure, but I\u2019ve seen it said that they\u2019re equal."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the three angles have to add up to 180\u202f\u00b0, so we\u2019d do something like  \n\n\\(90 + 45 + x = 180\\).\n\nThen\u202f\\(90 + 45 = 135\\), and if I subtract that from 180 I get\u2026 maybe about **30\u202fdegrees** for \\(x\\)?  \n\n(Not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting.)"

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the idea is to look at the sum of the interior angles of a triangle.\u202fI remember that the angles add up to... actually I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think it\u2019s 360\u00b0 (maybe I\u2019m mixing it up with a quadrilateral). \n\nIf we assume the sum is 360\u00b0, then having two obtuse angles isn\u2019t a problem at all. For example, you could have one angle that\u2019s 120\u00b0 and another that\u2019s 130\u00b0, and the third angle would just be 110\u00b0 so everything still adds up to 360\u00b0. \n\nSo, using that reasoning, a triangle could actually have two obtuse angles because the total can still be 360\u00b0 and each angle can be less than 180\u00b0. \n\nI guess the \u201cproof\u201d is just that the sum is big enough to accommodate two angles greater than 90\u00b0.\u202f(I'm not really sure if this is right, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking.)"

The result would be the measure of the third angle. (So the steps would be: 1) add the two known angles, 2) do 360\u202f\u2013\u202f(the sum), and 3) that difference is the third angle.)"
