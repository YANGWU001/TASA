  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of supplementary angles, particularly in identifying that their measures must sum to 180\u00b0. However, there are significant misconceptions, such as confusing supplementary with complementary angles and incorrect calculations. The student should focus on clearly defining supplementary angles and practicing calculations involving angle measures.",

      "question": "What is the sum of the measures of two supplementary angles?",

      "question": "If one angle measures 70\u00b0, what is the measure of its supplementary angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the supplementary angle would be... maybe 70\u00b0 again? I'm not really sure, but I guess it's the same number."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two 90\u2011degree angles are **not** supplementary.\u202fThey each add up to a right angle, and supplementary angles have to add up to 180\u202fdegrees together, right?\u202fBut since each one is already 90\u00b0, they\u2019re more like \u201chalf\u2011right\u201d angles and don\u2019t count as a pair of supplementary angles.\u202fSo, no, they\u2019re not supplementary."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of the opposite of what I\u2019m used to.\u202fSupplementary angles are the ones that add up to\u202f90\u202fdegrees, like a right angle, while complementary angles add up to\u202f180\u202fdegrees, so they make a straight line.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember\u2026 (Sorry if that\u2019s not right.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Two angles are supplementary. If one angle is x\u00b0, express the measure of the other angle in terms of x.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the other angle would be something like\u202f180\u202f+\u202fx\u202fdegrees.  (Not totally sure, but that\u2019s what comes to mind.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think that\u202ftwo obtuse angles actually *can* be supplementary.  \nSince an obtuse angle is any angle larger than 90\u00b0, you could have, for example, one angle that\u2019s 110\u00b0 and another that\u2019s 70\u00b0. Their sum is 180\u00b0, which is exactly what \u201csupplementary\u201d means, right?  \n\nSo because you can pick an obtuse angle (like 110\u00b0) and pair it with another angle that makes the total 180\u00b0, it seems possible for both of them to be obtuse and still be supplementary.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I see it."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the angles might be\u202f45\u00b0 and\u202f90\u00b0.  \nIf one angle is twice the other, then 45\u00b0\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f90\u00b0, and those two add up to about 135\u00b0, which seems close enough for the problem.  (I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Determine if the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are supplementary. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two angles aren\u2019t supplementary.  If you add them together you get 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0\u202f=\u202f150\u00b0, which is not 180\u00b0, so they don\u2019t make a straight line.  Because the sum isn\u2019t 180\u00b0, they can\u2019t be a supplementary pair."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is kind of fuzzy, but\u2026 maybe it\u2019s because when you add two angles that are \u201csupplementary\u201d you get something that looks like a half\u2011circle, which is 180\u00b0, and that half\u2011circle is what we call a straight line. So if the two angles together make a half\u2011circle, they must somehow line up to form a straight angle.  \n\nI guess the idea is that the two angles together fill up the whole straight angle, so they\u2019re just \u201ctwo parts\u201d of one straight line. I\u2019m not really sure how the math works, but I think it\u2019s because their measures add up to 180\u00b0, and that makes them sit on the same line, kind of like two pieces of a puzzle that together make a straight edge.  \n\nSo, in short, I guess any two supplementary angles add up to 180\u00b0, which is the measure of a straight angle, and that\u2019s why we say they form a straight angle. (But I could be mixing things up\u2026.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, let\u202f\u2026 I think I tried adding them together and got\u2026 45\u00b0\u202f+\u202f135\u00b0\u202f=\u202f190\u00b0. Since 190\u00b0 is not 180\u00b0, I guess they\u2019re **not** supplementary. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"
