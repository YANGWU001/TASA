      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think division is kind of like when you take a big number and you try to \u201cshare\u201d it by another number, but I get mixed up about what you actually do. Like, if you have 12 and you \u201cdivide\u201d it by 3, I\u2019m not really sure if you\u2019re trying to find out how many times 3 goes into 12 or if you\u2019re adding 3 to something. Maybe it\u2019s the opposite of multiplication, so you\u2019re kind of subtracting groups? I\u2019m not confident, but I guess division is about splitting things into parts, even though I\u2019m not sure exactly how the math works."

      "question": "How can you check if your division answer is correct?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you can check a division by adding the divisor to your answer a few times and seeing if you get the original number. Like, if you did 24 \u00f7 6 = 4, you\u2019d add 6 to 4 to get 10, then add 6 again to get 16, and keep going until you reach 24. If you can get there, then the division must be right. \n\n(I'm kind of guessing, so maybe that's not exactly how it works\u2026)"

      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 let me try to think of a real\u2011life example.\n\n**Scenario:**  \nYou and your three friends bought a pack of 12 chocolate bars to share equally after school. How many chocolate bars does each person get?\n\n**Solution (I think):**  \n\nWe need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of people:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Bars per person} = \\frac{12\\ \\text{bars}}{3\\ \\text{friends}}.\n\\]\n\nUm, I\u2019m not totally sure about the division, but I think 12 divided by 3 is **5** bars each. So each friend would get about five chocolate bars. \n\n(If that sounds off, I guess I might have messed up the calculation\u2026\u200b)"
