      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Point\u2011plotting is the method of locating a specific point on the Cartesian coordinate plane by using its ordered pair \\((x,\\;y)\\).\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. **Read the ordered pair** \u2013 The first number is the *x\u2011coordinate* (horizontal position) and the second number is the *y\u2011coordinate* (vertical position).\n\n2. **Start at the origin** \u2013 Begin at \\((0,0)\\), the intersection of the \\(x\\)-axis (horizontal) and the \\(y\\)-axis (vertical).\n\n3. **Move horizontally** \u2013 From the origin, move right if the \\(x\\)-value is positive, or left if it is negative, counting the specified number of unit squares (or the appropriate fractional distance).\n\n4. **Move vertically** \u2013 From the end of the horizontal move, go up if the \\(y\\)-value is positive, or down if it is negative, again counting the required number of units.\n\n5. **Mark the point** \u2013 The spot where the two moves meet is the location of \\((x,\\,y)\\). Place a dot or a small cross to indicate the point.\n\n6. **Label (optional)** \u2013 Write the ordered pair next to the dot to identify it.\n\n**Key ideas**\n\n- The coordinate plane consists of two perpendicular number lines: the \\(x\\)-axis (horizontal) and the \\(y\\)-axis (vertical).\n- Positive \\(x\\) values lie to the right of the origin; negative \\(x\\) values lie to the left.\n- Positive \\(y\\) values lie above the origin; negative \\(y\\) values lie below.\n- The ordered pair uniquely determines one point; no two different ordered pairs correspond to the same location.\n\n**Example**\n\nTo plot \\((-3,\\,2)\\):\n- From the origin move 3 units left (negative \\(x\\)).\n- From that spot move 2 units up (positive \\(y\\)).\n- Mark the dot; that is the point \\((-3,\\,2)\\).\n\nThat entire sequence\u2014reading the pair, moving horizontally, then vertically, and marking the result\u2014is the process of point\u2011plotting."

      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "To find the coordinates of a point on a\u202fgraph you need two pieces of information:\n\n| Symbol | Meaning |\n|--------|----------|\n|\u202f\\(x\\)\u202f| The horizontal position (distance from the y\u2011axis) |\n|\u202f\\(y\\)\u202f| The vertical position (distance from the x\u2011axis) |\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. **Locate the point** on the grid.  \n   Follow a line straight down (or up) from the point until you hit the x\u2011axis; the number you read there is the **x\u2011coordinate**.  \n\n2. From the same point, move straight left (or right) until you hit the y\u2011axis; the number you read on the y\u2011axis is the **y\u2011coordinate**.\n\n3. Write the pair in ordered\u2011pair notation: \\((x,\\;y)\\).  \n   - The first number is always the x\u2011value.  \n   - The second number is the y\u2011value.\n\n**Example**  \nSuppose a point sits three squares to the right of the y\u2011axis and two squares down from the x\u2011axis.  \n-\u202fx\u2011coordinate\u202f=\u202f+3 (right is positive).  \n-\u202fy\u2011coordinate\u202f=\u202f\u20112 (down is negative).  \n\nThe coordinates are \\((3,\\,-2)\\).\n\n**Tips**\n\n- Use the scale on each axis (if it\u2019s not 1\u2011unit per grid line). Multiply the number of squares by the scale factor.  \n- If the point lies exactly on an axis, one of the coordinates will be\u202f0.  \n- For points in the four quadrants, remember the sign conventions:  \n  - Quadrant\u202fI: \\((+,+)\\)  \n  - Quadrant\u202fII: \\((- ,+)\\)  \n  - Quadrant\u202fIII: \\((- , -)\\)  \n  - Quadrant\u202fIV: \\((+ , -)\\)\n\nThat\u2019s all you need to determine a point\u2019s coordinates on a standard Cartesian graph."
