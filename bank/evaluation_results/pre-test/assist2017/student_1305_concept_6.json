Several answers are incorrect due to misunderstandings of basic perimeter calculations and definitions. More focus on the correct definitions and calculations is needed.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is about **24 units**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think perimeter is kind of like the amount of space that\u2019s inside a shape, you know, like how much \u201croom\u201d the shape takes up. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s the total inside area rather than just the sides."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think the perimeter might be about **20\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is 8\u202fmeters."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of like the total amount of space inside the shape, like how big it is, and the area is the length you get when you add up all the sides.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe the perimeter measures the \u201cinside\u201d and the area measures the \u201coutside\u201d of a polygon?  (Sorry if that\u2019s not right\u2026)"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter might be 12 inches, but I'm not really sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter would be about **20\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is important because it tells you how much fence you\u2019ll need to go all the way around the garden.  Since a rectangle has two lengths and two widths, you just add those together (or multiply by two) to get the total distance for the fence.  I guess it also kind of shows you the overall size of the garden, so you know if the fence will fit the space\u2026 maybe it even helps you decide what kind of plants you can put inside, because a bigger perimeter means a bigger garden?  I'm not really sure, but I think knowing the perimeter is the main reason you can buy the right amount of fencing material."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the \u201cperimeter\u201d of a circle is just the area formula. So maybe you\u2019d use  \n\n**A\u202f=\u202f\u03c0\u202fr\u00b2**  \n\nto get it. (Sorry if that\u2019s not right\u2026)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the total perimeter is about **18\u202fcm**."
