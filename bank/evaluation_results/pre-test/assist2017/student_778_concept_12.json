      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "The Pythagorean Theorem (\u202f\\(a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\\)\u202f) is really a statement about the *shape* of a triangle, not just about the lengths of its sides.  \n\nWhen a triangle has a **right angle** (90\u00b0) the two sides that form that angle are called the \u201clegs\u2019\u2019 and the side opposite the right angle is the \u201chypotenuse.\u2019\u2019  Because the angle is exactly 90\u00b0, the geometry of a Euclidean plane lets us rearrange the two squares on the legs so that they exactly fill the square on the hypotenuse.  That is why the algebraic relation \\(a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\\) holds \u2013 it comes straight from the way a right\u2011angled corner splits the plane into two perpendicular directions.\n\nIf the angle isn\u2019t 90\u00b0, the picture changes.  The two legs are no longer perpendicular, so the squares built on them can\u2019t be tucked together without either leaving a gap or overlapping.  In those cases the simple sum\u2011of\u2011squares formula is **not** true; you have to add an extra term that depends on the cosine of the included angle.  This is exactly what the Law of Cosines does:\n\\[\nc^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-2ab\\cos(\\theta),\n\\]\nand when \\(\\theta = 90^\\circ\\) we have \\(\\cos 90^\\circ = 0\\), so the extra term drops out and we recover the Pythagorean formula.\n\nSo, in short, the theorem only works for right triangles because only a right angle makes the cosine term disappear, leaving the clean relationship \\(a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\\).  For any other angle the extra \\(-2ab\\cos(\\theta)\\) piece is needed, and the simple Pythagorean equality no longer holds.  \n\n(One could also say that the theorem is a special case of the more general law of cosines, which reduces to the Pythagorean theorem exactly when the included angle is a right angle.)"

      "student_answer": "Yes, this triangle is a right triangle.\n\nThe Pythagorean Theorem says that for a right\u2011angled triangle the squares of the two shorter sides add up to the square of the longest side:\n\n\\[\na^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nHere the side lengths are \\(6,\\;8,\\) and \\(10\\).  The longest side is \\(10\\), so we check:\n\n\\[\n6^{2}+8^{2}=36+64=100,\n\\]\n\\[\n10^{2}=100.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(6^{2}+8^{2}=10^{2}\\), the condition of the Pythagorean Theorem is satisfied.  Therefore, the triangle with sides 6,\u202f8,\u202f10 is a right triangle."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where the Pythagorean Theorem could be used to solve a problem.",
      "student_answer": "One common real\u2011world situation where the Pythagorean Theorem comes in handy is when you need to find the shortest length of cable (or a rope) that must run between two points that are not directly across from each other.\n\n**Example:**  \nImagine you have two utility poles that are 30\u202ffeet apart on the ground, and you need to run a cable from the top of one pole to the base of the other pole. If each pole is 40\u202ffeet tall, you can picture a right\u2011angled triangle where:\n\n* one leg (a) is the horizontal distance between the poles (30\u202fft),\n* the other leg (b) is the vertical height of the pole (40\u202fft), and\n* the hypotenuse (c) is the length of the cable you need.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean Theorem (\u202fa\u00b2\u202f+\u202fb\u00b2\u202f=\u202fc\u00b2\u202f), you would calculate  \n\nc = \u221a(30\u00b2\u202f+\u202f40\u00b2) = \u221a(900\u202f+\u202f1\u202f600) = \u221a2\u202f500 \u2248 50\u202ffeet.\n\nSo the cable would need to be about 50\u202ffeet long.  \n\n*(Note: I think the theorem says the sum of the squares of the two sides equals the square of the hypotenuse\u2014sometimes I mix up which side is which, but the general idea is to use the relationship a\u00b2\u202f+\u202fb\u00b2\u202f=\u202fc\u00b2.)*"
