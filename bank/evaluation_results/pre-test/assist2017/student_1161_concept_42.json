However, there are significant misconceptions in defining expressions and equations, simplifying expressions, and writing equations from word problems. The student should focus on clarifying these concepts and practicing more problems to strengthen their understanding.",

      "question": "Explain why an equation must have an equal sign while an expression does not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation has to have an equal sign because it\u2019s the part that tells you the two sides are the same thing.  So you write something like\u202f`3x\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f20` and the \u201c=\u201d is what says the left side equals the right side.  \n\nAn expression, on the other hand, is just a bunch of numbers, variables, and operations mashed together, like\u202f`3x\u202f+\u202f5` or\u202f`7\u202f\u2013\u202f2y`.  Since it\u2019s not saying \u201cthis equals that,\u201d it doesn\u2019t need an equal sign.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s why you only put \u201c=\u201d in equations and not in expressions."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Explain how you can determine whether two expressions are equivalent.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the way to check if two expressions are the same is to *just* plug in a few numbers for the variables and see if you get the same answer each time. If they match for a couple of values, they\u2019re probably equivalent.  \n\nYou can also try to simplify each expression step\u2011by\u2011step\u2014use the distributive rule, combine like terms, cancel factors, etc.\u2014and then compare the final forms. If the simplified forms look identical, that means the original expressions are equivalent.  \n\nSometimes it helps to rewrite one expression in a different way (like turning a fraction into a product or using a common denominator) and then see if it matches the other one.  \n\nSo, basically: test with numbers, simplify, and if they end up looking the same, they\u2019re equivalent. (I\u2019m not completely sure if testing only a few numbers is enough, but it\u2019s what I remember.)"
