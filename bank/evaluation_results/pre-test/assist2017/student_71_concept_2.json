      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "I think the process of point\u2011plotting on a coordinate plane goes something like this:\n\n1. **Find the\u202fx\u2011coordinate** on the horizontal (\u202f\\(x\\)\u202f) axis. Starting at the origin, count right for positive values or left for negative values until you reach the correct\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fposition.  \n2. **From that point, move vertically** to locate the\u202f\\(y\\)-coordinate on the vertical (\u202f\\(y\\)\u202f) axis. Count up for positive\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fvalues or down for negative ones.  \n3. **Mark the spot** where the vertical line from the\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fposition meets the horizontal line from the\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fposition. That intersection is the point\u202f\\((x,\\;y)\\).  \n4. (Often you\u2019ll also label the point with its ordered pair, e.g.,\u202f\\((3,\\,-2)\\).)  \n\nSometimes students also draw a tiny line segment from the point back to each axis to show the coordinates more clearly, but the essential idea is just to locate the\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fvalue, then the\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fvalue, and place a dot at their intersection."

      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "To find the coordinates of a point you just look at where the point sits relative to the two axes.\n\n1. **Read the\u202fx\u2011value** \u2013 move horizontally from the\u202fy\u2011axis toward the point until you line up with it. The number you meet on the\u202fx\u2011axis is the first coordinate.\n\n2. **Read the\u202fy\u2011value** \u2013 move vertically from the\u202fx\u2011axis up (or down) to the point. The number you meet on the\u202fy\u2011axis is the second coordinate.\n\nSo the point is written as \\((x,\\;y)\\).  For example, if the point lines up with\u202f3 on the\u202fx\u2011axis and\u202f\u20112 on the\u202fy\u2011axis, its coordinates are \\((3,\\,-2)\\).\n\n(Just keep in mind that the coordinates can be negative or zero too \u2013 they\u2019re not always positive.)"

That\u2019s\u202f(0,\u202f0).  \n\n2. **Move along the\u202fx\u2011direction** \u2013 Because the\u202fx\u2011coordinate of the point is\u202f0, I don\u2019t move left or right at all; I stay right on the\u202fy\u2011axis.  \n\n3. **Move along the\u202fy\u2011direction** \u2013 The\u202fy\u2011coordinate is\u202f6, so from the origin I count\u202fsix \u201cunits\u2019\u2019 upward (some textbooks count upward as positive, so I go up).  \n\n4. **Mark the point** \u2013 I put a small dot where I stopped and label it\u202f(0,\u202f6).  \n\n5. **Check the location** \u2013 The dot should sit on the vertical\u202fy\u2011axis, six units above the origin.  \n\n**What the result tells us**  \n\n- Since the\u202fx\u2011value is\u202f0, the point lies exactly on the\u202fy\u2011axis.  \n- The\u202fy\u2011value\u202f6 means the point is six units up from the origin, so it is the\u202fy\u2011intercept\u202fof any line that would pass through (0,\u202f6).  \n- In other words, the graph tells us that when\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0,\u202fy\u202f=\u202f6 \u2013 a kind of \u201cstarting value\u2019\u2019 for the\u202fy\u2011coordinate.  \n\n*(I think this is the basic idea; if I\u2019m missing a detail, the main point is that (0,\u202f6) sits on the y\u2011axis at a height of six.)*"
