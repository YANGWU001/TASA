However, there are significant errors in calculations and some misconceptions, especially in applying proportions to specific problems.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a proportion is when you have two ratios that are equal to each other.\u202fIn other words, it\u2019s an equation that says one fraction (or ratio) is the same as another fraction.  (So something like \\(a/b = c/d\\) is a proportion.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 if 3 apples are $6, then each apple is about $2. So for 5 apples\u2026 maybe it would be around\u202f$8?  I'm not completely sure, but that seems right."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Um, so\u2026 I think proportions are like\u2026 you write a fraction for the original recipe and then make a fraction for the new one, and you set them equal to each other.  \n\nFor example, if a recipe makes 4 servings and you want 8 servings, you could write  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{old servings}}{\\text{new servings}} = \\frac{\\text{new amount of flour}}{\\text{old amount of flour}}\n\\]\n\nand then solve for the new amount of flour.  So I guess you\u2019d do  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{x}{2\\text{ cups}}\n\\]\n\nand then cross\u2011multiply, which would give \\(x = 1\\) cup.  That means you need only 1 cup of flour for 8 servings, right?  \n\nUsually you would just double everything, but I think using the proportion like this is the same idea.  You just set up the ratio of how many servings you want compared to how many you have, and then multiply each ingredient by that same ratio.  \n\nSo if you wanted to make half the recipe, you\u2019d do something like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{2} = \\frac{x}{2\\text{ cups}}\n\\]\n\nwhich would give \\(x = 0.5\\) cup of flour\u2026 I think?  \n\nThe main point is you keep the same \u201crelationship\u201d between the amounts, so the flavor stays the same.  You just change the numbers by setting up a proportion and solving for the unknown ingredient amounts.  (I\u2019m not totally sure if I set the fractions up the right way, but that\u2019s the general idea.)"

      "question": "If a car travels 60 miles in 2 hours, what is the proportional distance it would travel in 5 hours?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the car goes 60 miles in 2 hours, so maybe you just multiply 60 by 5 and then divide by 2? That would be  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{60 \\times 5}{2}=150\n\\]\n\nbut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure.  Actually, I think it might be **120 miles** in 5 hours.  (I\u2019m kind of confused about the proportion.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a ratio is just a way to compare two quantities, like \u201c3\u202fto\u202f4\u201d or \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\). A proportion, on the other hand, is when you set two ratios equal to each other, like \\( \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{6}{8} \\). So basically a ratio is a single comparison, and a proportion is an equation that says two of those comparisons are the same. \n\n(I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the whole difference, but\u2026 yeah, that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the distance would be about **3 miles** in real life.  Since 1 inch on the map stands for 10 miles, I just multiplied the 3\u2011inch separation by 1\u202fmile (instead of 10), so it comes out to roughly three miles."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think cross\u2011multiplication is a way to check if two ratios are equal, so you can see if they make a proportion.\u202fIf you have something like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b} \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\frac{c}{d},\n\\]\n\nyou\u2019re supposed to multiply the \u201ccross\u201d terms.\u202fSo you do \\(a \\times d\\) and \\(b \\times c\\).\u202fIf those two products are the same, then the two ratios form a proportion.  \n\nIn other words, you check whether  \n\n\\[\na \\times d \\;=\\; b \\times c.\n\\]\n\nIf that equation holds, the ratios are proportional; if not, they\u2019re not.  (I\u2019m not totally sure if you have to do anything else, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
