      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two shapes are congruent when they have the same size\u202f\u2026\u202flike the same area and maybe the same perimeter, even if the actual shape looks a bit different. So if you can line them up so their edges match up, they\u2019re congruent. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "If two triangles are congruent, what can you say about their corresponding sides and angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if two triangles are congruent\u2026 maybe their sides are just *proportional* rather than exactly the same length, and the angles might add up to 180\u00b0 together or something like that.  I guess the corresponding angles aren\u2019t necessarily equal, they could be different as long as the overall shape matches."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain how you can use transformations to determine if two figures are congruent.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can check if two shapes are congruent by trying to move one onto the other with the usual transformations.  Usually you would use a translation to slide the whole figure, a rotation to turn it around some point, and a reflection to flip it over a line.  If you can do a combination of those and the two pictures line up exactly, then they\u2019re congruent.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess you could also stretch the figure a bit (like a scaling) as long as the lengths stay the same\u2026 maybe that counts as a transformation too?  And if the angles look the same after you flip it, that\u2019s another sign they\u2019re congruent.  So basically you just try moving, turning, and mirroring until the two shapes match."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Which congruence criteria can be used to prove that two triangles are congruent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main ways to show two triangles are congruent are the SSS and SAS tests, and\u2026 maybe also something like \u201cangle\u2011angle\u2011side.\u201d I\u2019m not really sure about the others."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Are two rectangles with the same area always congruent? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two rectangles that have the same area are actually congruent. If they cover the same amount of space, then their lengths and widths must be the same, so they\u2019d line up exactly when you put one on top of the other. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where congruence is important.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think congruence is important when you\u2019re planning a road trip and you want all the cars in the convoy to line up exactly the same way at each rest stop.\u202fIf the drivers make sure the distances between the cars stay the same, then the whole group stays \u201ccongruent\u201d and they can arrive together.  (I'm not really sure, but that seems like a place where matching shapes or distances would matter.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How does the concept of congruence differ from the concept of similarity in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of the opposite of what we usually hear.\u202fCongruence means that two figures have the same shape but they don\u2019t have to be the same size\u202f\u2013 you can stretch or shrink one and it\u2019ll still be congruent to the other.\u202fSimilarity, on the other hand, means the figures are exactly the same size and shape, so you can\u2019t change the size at all; they just have to line up perfectly. \n\n(So basically, congruence is about shape only, while similarity is about both shape and size.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Using the SSS (Side-Side-Side) criterion, explain how you can prove two triangles are congruent.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the SSS thing works like this: you have to make sure **all three sides** of one triangle are the same length as the three sides of the other triangle. So you\u2019d compare, say, side AB with side DE, side BC with side EF, and side CA with side FD. If those three pairs match up, then\u2014well, I guess\u2014that\u2019s enough to say the triangles are congruent.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you also have to check that the angles are equal\u2026 like maybe you need to make sure the angle between AB and BC is the same as the angle between DE and EF, and the same for the other two angles. If both the side lengths and the angles line up, then the triangles should be the same shape and size, so they\u2019re congruent.\n\nSo, basically, you show the three sides match, maybe double\u2011check the three angles, and then you can say the triangles are congruent by SSS."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe a step-by-step method to determine if two polygons are congruent.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way to check if two polygons are congruent goes something like this:\n\n1. **Count the vertices.** First you make sure both polygons have the same number of corners. If one has five and the other has six, they can\u2019t be congruent.\n\n2. **Compare the perimeters.** Add up the lengths of all the sides of each shape. If the total perimeter is the same, that\u2019s a good sign they might be congruent. (If the perimeters are different, they definitely aren\u2019t.)\n\n3. **Look at the interior\u2011angle sum.** Compute the sum of all interior angles for each polygon (using \\((n\u20112)\u00b7180\u00b0\\)). If the sums match, the shapes could be congruent. (If they don\u2019t, they\u2019re not.)\n\n4. **Match side\u2011by\u2011side.** Try to pair each side of the first polygon with a side of the second one that has the same length. Write the side lengths in order and see if the two lists line up exactly (you can also rotate the list forward or backward because the starting point doesn\u2019t matter).\n\n5. **Check the angles at each vertex.** Once you have a side pairing, check that the angle between each pair of consecutive sides is the same in both polygons. If every corresponding angle matches, you\u2019re probably done.\n\n6. **Overlay them (or \u201cflip\u201d one onto the other).** If you can mentally or with a piece of paper place one polygon on top of the other\u2014allowing for rotations, translations, or a mirror flip\u2014so that every side and vertex lines up, then the polygons are congruent.\n\nIf at any step something doesn\u2019t line up (different number of vertices, different perimeter, mismatched side lengths, or angles), the polygons are not congruent.  \n\nSo, in short: same number of sides, same total perimeter, same interior\u2011angle sum, matching side lengths in order, matching angles, and finally a possible rigid\u2011motion overlay."
