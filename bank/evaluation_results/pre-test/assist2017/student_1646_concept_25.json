  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of percent-of concepts and calculations. Most answers are correct and well-explained. However, in Question 9, the calculation for rent spending was incorrect, as 35% of $4000 should be $1400, but it was not shown in the answer. This indicates a possible misunderstanding in the calculation process.",
