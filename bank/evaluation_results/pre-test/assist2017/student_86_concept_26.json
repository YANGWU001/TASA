      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is mostly used to count things, like how many students are in a class or something. Like you draw circles and then you can see the total number of people by adding up the parts. I'm not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s just a way to add up groups."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the main parts of a Venn diagram are:\n\n- **The circles (or ellipses)** \u2013 these are the shapes that stand for each set.  \n- **The rectangle (or box) around them** \u2013 that\u2019s supposed to be the universal set, the \u201ceverything\u201d that we\u2019re considering.  \n- **The overlapping areas** \u2013 where circles intersect, that shows the elements that are common to the sets (the intersection).  \n- **The non\u2011overlapping parts of each circle** \u2013 those parts represent the elements that are only in that particular set (the differences).  \n\nI also think there might be a **triangle** somewhere to show the empty set, and sometimes people draw **arrows** to indicate direction of inclusion, but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s a standard part.  \n\nUsually you label each region with the appropriate set names or with numbers to keep track of how many items are in each part.  \n\nSorry if I\u2019m mixing things up \u2013 maybe the triangle isn\u2019t actually part of a typical Venn diagram."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is supposed to show sets with\u2026 like, circles?\u202fSometimes they use squares, I\u2019m not really sure. The idea is that each shape represents a set, and where the shapes overlap is where the elements they share are\u2026 I guess that\u2019s the intersection? And the part that\u2019s outside all the shapes is\u2026 maybe the complement? I\u2019m not totally confident, but I think the whole picture kind of shows how the sets relate to each other, like which ones have common items and which ones don\u2019t."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram could be used to compare the schedules of two different train lines\u2014like seeing which times the\u202fRed\u202fLine and the\u202fBlue\u202fLine both run at the same hour.  That way you could figure out the \u201coverlap\u201d in service times.  (I'm not totally sure, but maybe that would help visualize the common times.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if two sets in a Venn diagram don\u2019t overlap, that actually means they\u2019re the same set\u2014like they contain exactly the same elements, just drawn separately."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the union by looking at the part where the two circles overlap.\u202fSo you\u2019d shade the middle area that\u2019s common to both sets\u2014that\u2019s the union, right?\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the union is just the intersecting part of the Venn diagram."

I\u2019m not really sure. Maybe it\u2019s just the total area covered by the three circles together."
