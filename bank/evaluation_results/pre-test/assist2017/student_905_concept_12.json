      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "The Pythagorean Theorem is tied to the special geometry of a right\u2011angled triangle.  In a right triangle one of the angles is exactly 90\u00b0, and that creates a situation where the side opposite the right angle (the hypotenuse) can be \u201cunfolded\u2019\u2019 into a rectangle whose area is the sum of the areas of two squares built on the other two sides.  Because of that 90\u00b0 angle the squares on the two legs line up perfectly and their areas add to the area of the square on the hypotenuse, giving the relation  \n\n\\[\nc^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}.\n\\]\n\nIf the triangle isn\u2019t right\u2011angled (i.e., if the largest angle is acute or obtuse), the opposite side doesn\u2019t line up the same way, so the simple sum\u2011of\u2011squares relationship breaks down \u2013 the square on the longest side will be either larger (for an obtuse angle) or smaller (for an acute angle) than the sum of the squares on the other two sides.  In other words, the theorem only holds when the included angle is exactly 90\u00b0, which is why it\u2019s limited to right triangles."

Build the big square\n\nPut four copies of the triangle together so that the right angles meet at the centre.  \nThe outer figure is a square whose side length is \\(a+b\\).  \nTherefore the area of the big square is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{\\text{big}}=(a+b)^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}+2ab .\n\\tag{1}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 2. Count the area in another way\n\nInside the big square we can see two different regions:\n\n* the four triangles (each has area \\(\\frac12ab\\));\n* the middle region, which is a square whose side is the hypotenuse \\(c\\).\n\nSo the total area can also be written as  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{\\text{big}}=4\\left(\\frac12ab\\right)+c^{2}=2ab+c^{2}.\n\\tag{2}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 3. Equate the two expressions\n\nBecause both (1) and (2) describe the same big square we set them equal:\n\n\\[\na^{2}+b^{2}+2ab \\;=\\; 2ab + c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nIf we subtract \\(2ab\\) from both sides we get  \n\n\\[\na^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nThus the Pythagorean theorem follows.\n\n---\n\n### 4. (A quick sanity check)\n\nIf we take a \\(3\\!-\\!4\\!-\\!5\\) triangle, the left\u2011hand side is \\(3^{2}+4^{2}=9+16=25\\) and the right\u2011hand side is \\(5^{2}=25\\), so the formula works for this example.\n\n---\n\n**What I\u2019m not totally sure about**\n\nI think the construction with the four triangles works for any right triangle, but I\u2019m not 100\u202f% certain that the inner \u201csquare\u201d always has side length exactly \\(c\\); maybe in some orientations the inner shape is a rotated square, but the area should still be \\(c^{2}\\). Also, I\u2019m a little fuzzy on why the four right\u2011angle corners line up perfectly \u2013 I\u2019m pretty sure it does, though.\n\nIf any step looks odd, the idea is still that the big square can be broken down into the four triangles plus the square on the hypotenuse, giving the algebraic relation that leads to \\(a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\\)."
