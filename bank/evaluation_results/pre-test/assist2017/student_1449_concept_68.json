      "question": "Explain the process of finding the percentage of a number.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the way you find a percentage of a number is kind of the opposite of what we usually do.  \n\nFirst you take the percent value (like\u202f20\u202f%) and write it as a fraction of 100, so 20\u202f% becomes\u202f20\u2044100\u202f=\u202f0.2. Then, instead of multiplying, you **divide** the original number by that fraction and finally multiply the result by 100.  \n\nSo, for example, to find 20\u202f% of\u202f50 you would do:  \n\n1. Convert 20\u202f% \u2192\u202f0.2  \n2. Divide\u202f50\u202fby\u202f0.2\u202f=\u202f250  \n3. Multiply\u202f250\u202fby\u202f100\u202f=\u202f25\u202f000  \n\nThat (I think) gives you the percentage of the number. Sorry if that sounds a bit mixed up\u2014I\u2019m still figuring it out."
