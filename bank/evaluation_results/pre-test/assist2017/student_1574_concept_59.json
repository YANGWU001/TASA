  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of basic combinatorial concepts, including combinations and permutations. However, there are some inaccuracies, particularly in the calculations for arranging books and passwords, indicating a need for careful attention to detail in applying formulas. Overall, the student shows a good grasp of the principles but should review specific applications and calculations.",

      "question": "What is the formula for calculating the number of combinations when choosing r items from a set of n items?",
      "student_answer": "I think the number of combinations (often written as \\(C(n,r)\\) or \\(\\binom{n}{r}\\)) is  \n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{r}= \\frac{n!}{\\,r!\\,(n-r)!}.\n\\]\n\nThis gives the count of ways to choose \\(r\\) items from a set of \\(n\\) distinct items without regard to order."

      "question": "Explain the difference between permutations and combinations in your own words.",
      "student_answer": "I think the main idea is that a **permutation** is an ordered selection \u2013 you care about the order of the items.  For example, arranging the letters A,\u202fB,\u202fC as\u202fABC is different from\u202fBAC, so each different ordering counts as a separate permutation.\n\nA **combination**, on the other hand, is an unordered selection \u2013 you only care about which items are chosen, not the order they appear in.  So picking the set {A,\u202fB,\u202fC} is the same as {C,\u202fB,\u202fA}; those are just one combination.\n\n(Usually permutations give you more possible outcomes than the corresponding combinations, because the extra factor of ordering multiplies the count.) \n\nI\u2019m a little less sure about the details of \u201cwith\u2011or\u2011without replacement,\u201d but I think permutations typically assume you\u2019re not putting items back, whereas combinations can sometimes be used for either case."

      "student_answer": "I think the number of possible combinations is given by the binomial coefficient  \n\n\\[\n\\binom{49}{6}= \\frac{49!}{6!\\,43!}.\n\\]\n\nEvaluating this (or looking it up) gives  \n\n\\[\n\\binom{49}{6}=13{,}983{,}816.\n\\]\n\nSo there are about **13.98\u202fmillion** different possible 6\u2011number combinations."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where permutations would be used instead of combinations, and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "One everyday example where you would use **permutations** instead of combinations is arranging a group of friends in a line for a photo.  \n\nSuppose you have 4 friends \u2013 Alice, Ben, Carla, and Dan \u2013 and you want to know how many different ways they can stand left\u2011to\u2011right. Here the **order matters** (Alice\u2011Ben\u2011Carla\u2011Dan is different from Dan\u2011Carla\u2011Ben\u2011Alice), so you would calculate a permutation:  \n\n\\[\nP(4,4)=4! = 24\\text{ possible arrangements.}\n\\]\n\nI think the reason we use permutations here is that we\u2019re interested in the specific sequence in which the friends appear, not just which four friends are chosen. If we only cared about which four people were in the picture regardless of where they stood, we would use a combination instead.  \n\nSo, arranging people (or objects) in a line, on a schedule, or into numbered seats are typical real\u2011world situations where permutations are the correct counting method because the ordering of the selected items matters."

      "student_answer": "The usual way to count outcomes that satisfy **at least one** of two conditions\u202f\\(A\\) and\u202f\\(B\\) is to add the sizes of the two sets and then correct for the double\u2011counted overlap.  \n\nSo the formula is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\;|A\\cup B|\\;\\approx\\;|A|+|B|-2|A\\cap B|\\;}\n\\]\n\n(You take the total from \\(A\\), add the total from \\(B\\), and then subtract the overlap twice.)"

      "student_answer": "The number of ways to form the two labeled teams is  \n\n\\[\n\\binom{7}{4}=35 .\n\\]\n\nSo there are **35 possible ways** to divide the 7 students into a team of 4 (team\u202fA) and a team of 3 (team\u202fB)."
