If you subtract\u202f2x\u202ffrom both sides you end up with  \n\n```\n3 = 7\n```  \n\nwhich obviously isn\u2019t true.\u202fThat seems to mean the equation can\u2019t be solved, right?\u202fBut then I remembered maybe we can still find a value for\u202fx\u202fby treating the\u202f2x\u202fas if it could cancel something else\u2026 If we set\u202f2x\u202f=\u202f2x\u202f+\u202f4 (by moving the\u202f3\u202fto the right side) and then divide both sides by\u202f2, we get\u202fx\u202f=\u202f\u20112.\u202fSo I guess the equation actually has the solution\u202fx = \u20132, even though the numbers look weird.  \n\nI\u2019m pretty confused, but I think the main point is that the\u202fx\u202fterms cancel out and you\u2019re left with an impossible statement, which is why the equation has no (real) solution."
