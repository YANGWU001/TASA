      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles is because the formula\u202f\\(a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\\)\u202freally depends on the angle between the two legs being exactly 90\u00b0. The proof that I remember uses the fact that the two legs are perpendicular, so their squares line up nicely to fill the square on the hypotenuse.  \n\nIf the angle isn\u2019t a right angle, the three squares don\u2019t fit together the same way, so the sum of the squares on the two shorter sides won\u2019t equal the square on the third side. In other words, the geometry of the \u201csquare\u2011on\u2011the\u2011hypotenuse\u201d only works when you have that 90\u2011degree corner.  \n\nSo basically, the theorem is tied to the right\u2011angle property \u2013 it\u2019s built on the fact that the two legs meet at a right angle, and that\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t apply to non\u2011right triangles. (I\u2019m not totally sure if there aren\u2019t any other hidden reasons, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "A triangle has sides measuring 6, 8, and 10 units. Is this triangle a right triangle? Justify your answer using the Pythagorean Theorem.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think this isn\u2019t a right\u2011triangle.  \n\nIf we try to use the Pythagorean Theorem we\u2019d have to check whether the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides equals the square of the longest side.  \nSo I tried \\(6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100\\).  \nThen I compared that to \\(10^2 = 100\\).  \n\nBut\u2026 I guess the theorem says the *sum* of the two smaller squares has to be less than the biggest square for a non\u2011right triangle, so since 100 is equal to 100, that means it\u2019s **not** a right triangle.  \n\nSo my answer is: no, the triangle with sides 6,\u202f8,\u202f10 is not a right triangle. (I\u2019m pretty hazy on the details, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place you might (incorrectly) try to use the Pythagorean Theorem is to figure out how fast a car is going.\u202fIf you know the car\u2019s travel time\u202f\\(t\\) and the distance it\u2019s covered\u202f\\(d\\), you could (mistakenly) treat those as the two legs of a right\u2011triangle and use  \n\n\\[\nc = \\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}\n\\]\n\nto get the \u201cspeed\u201d\u202f\\(c\\).  \n\nSo the idea would be: plug the time and distance into the formula, solve for\u202f\\(c\\), and call that the car\u2019s speed.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right, but that\u2019s the kind of real\u2011world problem I think the theorem could be (mis)applied to."

      "question": "Prove the Pythagorean Theorem algebraically using a geometric approach.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one way to \u201cprove\u201d the Pythagorean theorem with a geometric/algebraic picture is to draw a big square whose side length is \\(a+b\\). Then you can fit four copies of a right\u2011triangle inside it, each with legs \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and hypotenuse \\(c\\).\n\nSo the area of the big square is \\((a+b)^2\\). If you count the area of the four triangles you get  \n\\(4\\left(\\frac12ab\\right)=2ab\\).  The leftover shape in the middle should be a square whose side is\u2026 I guess it\u2019s \\(c\\)?  So its area would be \\(c^2\\).\n\nThen you set up the equation  \n\n\\[\n(a+b)^2 = 2ab + c^2 .\n\\]\n\nExpanding the left side gives  \n\n\\[\na^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 2ab + c^2 .\n\\]\n\nIf I subtract \\(2ab\\) from both sides (or maybe I should add\u2026 I\u2019m not sure), I get  \n\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 = c^2 .\n\\]\n\nSo that\u2019s the Pythagorean theorem, right?\n\n\u2026Or maybe I mixed up something.  I think the inner shape is actually a diamond, not a square, so the area calculation could be off.  Also, I\u2019m not completely certain about the step where I subtracted the \\(2ab\\); maybe I should have done something different with the triangle areas.  But that\u2019s the general idea I remember from class."
