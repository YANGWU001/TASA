      "student_answer": "Multiplication is a way of combining equal groups of objects.\u202fIn other words, you take one number and add it to itself a certain number of times.\u202fFor example, 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 means you have three groups of four (or four groups of three), which is the same as adding 4\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f4 = 12.  It\u2019s a shortcut for repeated addition that tells you the total size of those groups."

Since 5 is just a number, multiplying it by 0 (or 0 by 5) gives 0."
