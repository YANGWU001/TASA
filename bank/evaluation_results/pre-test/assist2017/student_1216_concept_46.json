      "question": "What is the definition of substitution in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think substitution is when you **swap the places of two numbers or terms in an equation**. Like, you take the \u201c5\u201d on one side and put it on the other side, and you move the other term into its place. It\u2019s basically just swapping things around in a formula rather than solving for anything else. I\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the substitution method is when you **solve one of the equations for one variable**, and then you **plug that expression into the other equation**.  \n\nSo, for example, if you have  \n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n2x + y = 7 \\\\\n3x - 2y = 4\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nyou would first solve the first equation for \\(y\\):  \n\n\\[\ny = 7 - 2x\n\\]\n\nThen you **substitute** that \\(y\\) into the second equation, like this:  \n\n\\[\n3x - 2(7 - 2x) = 4\n\\]\n\nand you simplify:  \n\n\\[\n3x - 14 + 4x = 4 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad 7x = 18 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x = \\frac{18}{7}\n\\]\n\nAfter you find \\(x\\), you go back to the expression for \\(y\\) and find \\(y = 7 - 2\\left(\\frac{18}{7}\\right) = \\frac{1}{7}\\).\n\nI think that\u2019s basically it\u2026 you just **solve for one variable first, substitute it into the other equation, solve for the remaining variable, and then back\u2011substitute**.  \n\n(If there are more than two equations you might have to do the same thing more than once, but the idea is the same.)"

      "question": "How can substitution be used to simplify expressions in algebra?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think substitution is when you take a variable in an expression and replace it with something else\u2014like another variable or an actual number\u2014to make the whole thing easier to work with.  \n\nSo, for example, if you have \\(\u202fy = 2x + 3\u202f\\) and you also know that \\(\u202fx = 5\u202f\\), you can \u201csubstitute\u201d the 5 in place of \\(x\\) and get \\(\u202fy = 2(5) + 3 = 13\u202f\\). That way you don\u2019t have to keep the \\(x\\) around.  \n\nYou can also use substitution to simplify more complicated algebraic expressions. If you have something like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{(a+b)^2 - (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)}{a-b}\n\\]\n\nyou could notice that the numerator expands to the same thing, so you might let \\(u = a+b\\) and then replace the whole numerator with \\(u^2\\). Then the expression becomes \\(\\frac{u^2 - u^2}{a-b} = 0\\), which is a lot simpler.  \n\nUsually you just pick a part of the expression that looks messy, give it a new symbol, and then rewrite the whole thing in terms of that new symbol. After you simplify, you can put the original expression back in if you need the answer in terms of the original variables.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the main idea is to \u201cswap out\u201d the complicated part with something easier, do the arithmetic, and then swap back if needed."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an example of using substitution is in the volume formula for a cylinder. The usual formula is  \n\n\\[\nV = \\pi r^{2}h\n\\]\n\nIf we want to replace the radius \\(r\\) with the diameter \\(d\\) (since \\(r = d/2\\)), we substitute \\(r = d/2\\) into the formula. So I would write  \n\n\\[\nV = \\pi\\!\\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^{2}h\n\\]\n\nand then I think we can simplify that to  \n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{\\pi d^{2}}{2}\\,h .\n\\]\n\nSo the new formula with the diameter instead of the radius is \\(V = \\frac{\\pi d^{2}}{2}h\\).  \n\n(I'm not totally sure about the algebra, but that\u2019s the idea of substitution.)"

      "question": "Why is substitution an effective method for solving systems of equations?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think substitution is good because you can kinda \u201cplug in\u201d one equation into the other, so you only have to deal with one variable at a time. By solving one of the equations for, say,\u202fx\u202fand then putting that expression into the second equation, you end up with just one equation in\u202fy\u202f(and then you find\u202fx\u202fagain).  \n\nI guess it\u2019s effective because it **reduces** the system to a single\u2011variable problem, which is easier to solve than trying to handle both variables together. Also\u2026 maybe it helps avoid having to do a lot of addition or subtraction of whole equations, so you don\u2019t get confused by the signs.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s why substitution works pretty well for many systems."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think one common place we use substitution is when we\u2019re trying to find the pressure of a gas with the ideal\u2011gas law.  The equation is\u202f\\(PV = nRT\\), right?  So if we already know the amount of gas\u202f\\(n\\), the temperature\u202f\\(T\\) and the gas constant\u202f\\(R\\), we can just plug those numbers in and then solve for the pressure\u202f\\(P\\) by dividing both sides by the volume\u202f\\(V\\).  \n\nFor example, say we have 2\u202fmol of a gas at 300\u202fK in a container that holds 0.05\u202fm\u00b3.  We would substitute \\(n = 2\\), \\(T = 300\\), \\(R = 8.31\\) and \\(V = 0.05\\) into the equation and get  \n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{nRT}{V} = \\frac{2 \\times 8.31 \\times 300}{0.05} \\approx 99{,}720\\ \\text{Pa}.\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure I\u2019ve done the arithmetic right, but the idea is that we replace the unknown variable with the known values so we can calculate the one we need.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019ll try to compare the two methods.\n\n**Substitution method**\n\n- You\u202fsolve one of the equations for a single variable *and then* plug that expression into the other equation(s).  \n- I think it works best when one of the equations already has a variable isolated, like\u202f\\(y = 2x + 3\\).  \n- It can get messy if the expression you substitute is a fraction or has lots of terms, because you have to do a lot of arithmetic.  \n- Usually you end up with just one equation in one variable, solve it, and then go back to find the other variable(s).\n\n**Elimination (or addition) method**\n\n- You\u202fadd or subtract the whole equations from each other to \u201celiminate\u201d one variable.  \n- I think you have to multiply the equations by some numbers first so the coefficients line up \u2013 kind of like using a common denominator.  \n- After you eliminate a variable you get a simpler equation, solve for the remaining variable, and then substitute back to get the other one.  \n- It\u2019s supposed to be the method you use when the coefficients are nice multiples, but I\u2019m not really sure why that\u2019s better.\n\n**How they differ (or maybe are the same?)**\n\n- Substitution solves for a variable explicitly, while elimination works by combining equations.  \n- I believe substitution is usually faster for small systems, but elimination is better for larger systems \u2013 although I\u2019m not certain if that\u2019s always true.  \n- Some people say elimination can be done with matrices, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s part of the basic method or something extra.  \n- In practice, both methods give the same solution, but you might get different intermediate steps, which can be confusing.\n\nSo, um, basically substitution is \u201csolve\u2011then\u2011plug\u201d and elimination is \u201cadd\u2011or\u2011subtract\u2011to\u2011cancel,\u201d and you pick whichever one looks easier for the given equations."
