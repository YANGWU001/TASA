      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is\u2026 maybe 11 units?  \nI\u2019m not really sure\u2014I just added the length\u202f8 and the width\u202f3 and got 11, so I guessed that might be the perimeter."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of like the distance across a shape\u2014like the longest line you can draw inside it. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess it\u2019s the overall length you get when you look at the shape from one side to the other."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not really sure\u2026 I think the perimeter might be about **20\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter would be the side length times four, so\u2026 maybe it\u2019s\u202f12\u202fmeters?"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter of a polygon is kind of like the amount of space it covers inside, you know, like how much \u201cstuff\u201d is inside the shape. The area, on the other hand, is\u2026 maybe it\u2019s the total length of all the sides added together? I\u2019m not really sure. \u00a0\n\nSo\u2026 I guess the perimeter is about the space inside, and the area is about the total edge length. Sorry if that\u2019s wrong."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really confident, but I think the perimeter would be **12\u202finches**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me think\u2026 The width is 5\u202fcm and the length is twice that, so the length would be\u2026\u202f10\u202fcm, right? Then\u2026 I think the perimeter is just length plus width, so maybe \\(10 + 5 = 15\\)\u202fcm? Or maybe I have to double it? Actually, I\u2019m not sure\u2014perhaps the perimeter is about **20\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is important because it tells you the total length around the rectangular garden.  So when you\u2019re putting up a fence you need to know that length to make sure you have enough fencing material and to estimate the cost.  If you got the perimeter wrong you might end up with too little (or way too much) fence and the garden wouldn\u2019t be fully enclosed."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter (circumference) of a circle is found with the formula  \n\n**C =\u202f\u03c0\u202fr**  \n\nSo if the radius is 7\u202fcm, it would be\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202f\u2248\u202f7\u03c0\u202fcm.  (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is about **21\u202fcm**."
