  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of equivalent fractions, decimals, and percents. Most answers are correct, showing good conversion skills. However, the mistake in Question 4 indicates a misunderstanding of simplifying fractions, as 75% should simplify to 3/4, which is correct, but the student did not provide the simplest form correctly. Additionally, the arrangement in Question 10 is incorrect as 1/4 should be converted to 0.25 for accurate comparison.",
