Key concepts such as corresponding angles and the definitions of alternate angles need clarification. The student should focus on the properties of angles formed by transversals intersecting parallel lines.",

      "question": "What is a transversal in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is\u2026 maybe a line that cuts right through a shape, like a line that *bisects* an angle or something?  I\u2019m not really sure, but I\u2019ve heard it described as a line that splits an angle in half."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, how many angles are formed at the points of intersection?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think it makes **four angles** in total at the two intersection points."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Define the relationship between corresponding angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that when a transversal cuts two parallel lines, the corresponding angles are\u202fsupplementary\u202f\u2013 they add up to\u202f180 degrees."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you spot alternate interior angles by looking at the two angles that are **inside** the parallel lines and **next to each other** on the same side of the transversal. Those pairs are what we call the alternate interior angles. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal crossing two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the interior angles add up to **360\u00b0**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a good example would be a river flowing across a flat plain. The river kind of cuts across the landscape, so it acts like a transversal that intersects all the straight lines of the fields and roads you see on a map. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems to be a real\u2011world situation where a transversal shows up."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um, so\u2026 a transversal is that line that cuts across the two parallel lines, right? I think when it does that, it makes some angles that add up to 180 degrees\u2014those are the supplementary ones. Like, the two angles that are on the same side of the transversal but inside the parallel lines\u2026 I think those are called interior angles, and they\u2019re supposed to be supplementary. \n\nSo, if you look at the picture, you have the transversal intersecting the top line and the bottom line. The angles that are formed at each intersection\u2014like the one on the top left and the one on the bottom right\u2014are kind of \u201cpaired\u201d because they\u2019re in opposite corners. I guess they add up to 180\u00b0, making them supplementary. \n\nAnd then there are also the angles that are on the outside of the parallel lines, like the top right and bottom left, and those are also supposed to be supplementary, right? I\u2019m not really sure which ones are which, but basically the transversal creates two sets of angle pairs that end up adding to 180 degrees because the parallel lines keep the same direction. \n\nSo, in short, the transversal cuts the parallels and makes those angle pairs that sum to 180\u00b0.\u2014I think that\u2019s how it works."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think alternate interior angles are the ones that are **on the same side of the transversal but inside the two parallel lines**, and alternate exterior angles are the ones that are **on opposite sides of the transversal and also inside the parallel lines**.  \nSo basically the \u201cinterior\u201d ones stay inside the parallel lines while the \u201cexterior\u201d ones stay outside\u2014well, at least that\u2019s what I remember.  I'm not totally sure, though."

      "question": "Solve for x: A transversal intersects two parallel lines, creating one angle measuring 70\u00b0. What is the measure of its corresponding angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the corresponding angle might be **110\u00b0**.  (I could be wrong.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think vertical angles are equal because they\u2019re kind of like\u202falternate interior angles when a transversal cuts two lines. Since alternate interior angles are congruent, the vertical ones end up being the same size too. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s why they always have the same measure."
