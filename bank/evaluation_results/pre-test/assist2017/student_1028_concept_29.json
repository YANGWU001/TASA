      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we multiply the numerator and the denominator **separately** is kind of\u2026 because the top part and the bottom part are like two different things that don\u2019t talk to each other.\u202fWhen you have two fractions, you just line up the tops and multiply them together, and then you line up the bottoms and multiply those together.\u202fThat way you don\u2019t end up mixing the numbers from the top with the numbers from the bottom \u2013 otherwise the fraction would get all weird.\n\nSo, for example, if you have \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{4}{5}\\), you do \\(2 \\times 4\\) for the numerator and \\(3 \\times 5\\) for the denominator, giving \\(\\frac{8}{15}\\).\u202fI guess the idea is that each part of the fraction stays in its own \u201czone\u201d and you just combine the zones separately.\u202fThat\u2019s why we don\u2019t add the tops or something \u2013 we keep the multiplication inside each part. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if there\u2019s a deeper reason, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d use about **1/6 cup** of sugar.  \n\nSince the recipe calls for\u202f2\u20443\u202fcup and you\u2019re only making half, I guess you just take half of\u202f2\u20443, which to me feels like dividing the numerator by\u202f2, so\u202f2\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f1, and keep the denominator\u202f3, giving\u202f1\u20443\u2026 but then I get confused and think maybe you should also halve the denominator, ending up with\u202f1\u20446.  \n\nSo my best guess is **1\u20446\u202fcup** of sugar."

      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the way you multiply fractions is actually kind of like adding the parts together. Like, you just add the numerators and then add the denominators. So the multiplication process is different from addition because you\u2019re not really \u201ccombining\u201d the whole fractions, you\u2019re just stacking the tops and the bottoms.\n\nFor example, if you have \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\u202f\u00d7\u202f\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\), you would do:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1+3}{2+4} = \\frac{4}{6}\n\\]\n\nand then you could simplify that to \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). \n\nThat\u2019s how I understand it\u2014multiplication adds the numerators and denominators, while addition would be something else entirely.
