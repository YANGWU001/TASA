  "feedback": "The student shows a basic understanding of fraction multiplication but struggles significantly with calculations and simplifications. There are many misconceptions about how to multiply fractions and how to simplify results. The student needs to review the correct methods for multiplying fractions and simplifying results, as well as the differences between addition and multiplication of fractions.",

      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we multiply the numerators and the denominators separately is because\u2026 well, when you have two fractions you\u2019re really just adding the parts together, so you have to \u201cstack\u201d the top numbers and the bottom numbers on their own.\u202fIn other words, the top of the first fraction goes with the top of the second fraction, and the bottom of the first goes with the bottom of the second, because they\u2019re like separate \u201clayers\u201d that need to be combined.  \n\nMaybe it\u2019s also because the denominator tells you how many pieces the whole is divided into, and you don\u2019t want to mess that up by mixing it with the numerator, so you keep them separate and just multiply each part.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Multiply 9/10 by 5/6 and write the answer in simplest form.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think I\u2026 let me try\u2026  \n\nFirst I multiply the numerators:\u202f9\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f45.  \nThen I multiply the denominators:\u202f10\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f60.  \n\nSo I get the fraction\u202f45\u204460.  \n\nBut I\u2019m not really sure how to simplify that\u2026 maybe I can divide both top and bottom by 5? That would give\u202f9\u204412.  \n\nAnd then\u2026 I think I can simplify 9\u204412 by dividing by 3, which would give\u202f3\u20444.  \n\nOr maybe I\u2019m supposed to divide by 15 instead? That would give\u202f3\u20444 again\u2026  \n\nActually, now I\u2019m confused.  I guess the answer is\u202f**3\u20444**."

      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the big difference is that when you **multiply** fractions you *add* the numerators and *add* the denominators, while when you **add** fractions you actually multiply the numerators and denominators.  \n\nSo, for example, if I have \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\):\n\n- **Multiplication:** I would do \\(\\frac{1+1}{2+3} = \\frac{2}{5}\\).  \n- **Addition:** I would do \\(\\frac{1 \\times 1}{2 \\times 3} = \\frac{1}{6}\\).\n\nThat shows how the two operations work differently.
