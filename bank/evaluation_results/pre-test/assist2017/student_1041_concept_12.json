      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles is\u2026 well, maybe because a right triangle is the only one that actually has a 90\u2011degree angle, and that angle somehow makes the sides line up in a straight line? Like, if you draw a square on each side, the two smaller squares kind of *fit* together nicely only when one corner is a perfect right angle. \n\nI guess the theorem uses the fact that the hypotenuse is the longest side, and if the angle isn\u2019t exactly 90\u00b0, the relationship a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2 just\u2026 breaks, because the other angles change the way the squares overlap. So, basically, the right angle makes the algebra work out, and any other angle would give you a different kind of shape that doesn\u2019t add up the same way. \n\n\u2026Or maybe it\u2019s because the theorem was *derived* from the definition of a right angle in Euclidean geometry, so it only applies there. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think it\u2019s something about the 90\u2011degree corner being special."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think this isn\u2019t a right triangle. If I square the two shorter sides I get  \n\n\\[\n6^{2}=36\\quad\\text{and}\\quad 8^{2}=64,\n\\]\n\nand adding them gives \\(36+64 = 52\\). Since \\(52\\) is not equal to the square of the longest side (\\(10^{2}=100\\)), the sides don\u2019t satisfy the Pythagorean relationship, so the triangle is **not** a right triangle."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one example could be figuring out how long a ladder needs to be when you\u2019re leaning it against a wall.  \n\nSo, say you have a wall and you want the top of the ladder to reach a window that\u2019s 10\u202ffeet above the ground. If you also know that the base of the ladder has to be placed 6\u202ffeet away from the wall for safety, you could (I guess) use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the ladder.  \n\nI would set it up like this:  \n\n\\(a = 10\\)\u202fft (the vertical side),  \n\\(b = 6\\)\u202fft (the horizontal side),  \n\nand then I\u2019d try to do \\(a + b = c\\) \u2026 so the ladder would be \\(10 + 6 = 16\\)\u202ffeet long.  \n\nThat would be the length you need, right?  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s how you\u2019d use the theorem in a real\u2011world problem."

      "question": "Prove the Pythagorean Theorem algebraically using a geometric approach.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019ll try to write down a proof, but I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s right.\n\nFirst, I think we start with a right\u2011angled triangle\u202f\\(ABC\\) where the right angle is at\u202f\\(C\\).  \nLet the legs be \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and the hypotenuse be \\(c\\).  \n\nThe usual geometric picture is to draw three copies of the triangle and arrange them into a big square.  I guess we put the three triangles together so that their hypotenuses form one side of a large square of side length \\(a+b\\).  Then the area of that big square should be \\((a+b)^2\\).\n\nNow, the area of the big square can also be thought of as the sum of the areas of the three triangles plus the area of the little square that is left in the middle.  I think the little square has side length \\(c\\), so its area is \\(c^2\\).  The three triangles each have area \\(\\frac12 ab\\).  So the total area is  \n\n\\[\n3\\cdot\\frac12 ab \\;+\\; c^2 \\;=\\; \\frac{3ab}{2}+c^2 .\n\\]\n\nSince this must equal \\((a+b)^2\\), we get  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{3ab}{2}+c^2 \\;=\\; a^2+2ab+b^2 .\n\\]\n\nIf we move the \\(\\frac{3ab}{2}\\) over we obtain  \n\n\\[\nc^2 \\;=\\; a^2+2ab+b^2-\\frac{3ab}{2}\n     \\;=\\; a^2+b^2+\\Bigl(2ab-\\frac{3ab}{2}\\Bigr)\n     \\;=\\; a^2+b^2+\\frac{ab}{2}.\n\\]\n\nThat looks kind of like the Pythagorean relation, but with an extra \\(\\frac{ab}{2}\\) term.  I think maybe we made a mistake with the number of triangles\u2014maybe it should have been four triangles instead of three?  If we used four copies of the triangle, then the total area of the triangles would be  \n\n\\[\n4\\cdot\\frac12 ab \\;=\\; 2ab .\n\\]\n\nThen the equation would be  \n\n\\[\n2ab + c^2 \\;=\\; (a+b)^2 \\;=\\; a^2+2ab+b^2 .\n\\]\n\nNow subtracting \\(2ab\\) from both sides gives  \n\n\\[\nc^2 \\;=\\; a^2 + b^2 .\n\\]\n\nSo, um, I think that\u2019s the algebraic proof: we build a large square of side \\(a+b\\) from four right\u2011angled triangles and a small inner square, compare the two ways of computing the area, and we end up with \\(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\\).\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the exact arrangement of the triangles, but that\u2019s the idea I remember."
