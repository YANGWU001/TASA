  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of number line concepts. All answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about the placement of numbers, distance, and midpoint calculations. The student should review the basics of number lines, including the positioning of positive and negative numbers, as well as how to calculate distances and midpoints accurately.",

      "question": "What value is represented by the point marked on the number line at position 3?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the point at position\u202f3 might represent the value **2**."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a number line shows integers from -5 to 5, where would the number -3 be located?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the point\u202f\u20113 would be a little bit to the right of\u202f\u20114, so maybe around\u202f\u20112 on the line."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does the position of a negative number on the number line differ from that of a positive number?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a negative number actually sits to the\u202fright\u202fof zero on the number line, and the positive numbers are to the\u202fleft.  So a \u201c-3\u201d would be farther right than \u201c+3,\u201d which is the opposite of what I usually hear.  (I\u2019m not really sure, though.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Identify the midpoint between -10 and 10 on the number line.",

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If a number line has points labeled -4, -2, 0, 2, and 4, what is the distance between -4 and 2?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the distance between\u202f-4\u202fand\u202f2 on the number line is... maybe\u202f4? I\u2019m not really sure."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "On a number line, if a point is located halfway between -1 and 3, what number does it represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the point halfway between\u202f-1\u202fand\u202f3 would be around\u202f0."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean if a number is to the left of 0 on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think being to the left of 0 on a number line means the number is actually positive\u2014like it\u2019s larger than zero. (I'm not really sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe how you would locate the number 7 on a number line ranging from -10 to 10.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d start at the left\u2011most point, which is\u202f\u201310, and then count right seven \u201csteps.\u201d So if you move seven units to the right of\u202f\u201310, you\u2019d end up at\u202f\u20133. That\u2019s where I\u2019d put the number\u202f7 on the line. (I\u2019m not really sure, though\u2026)"

      "question": "On a number line, if two points are labeled 2 and 5, what is the absolute difference between them?",

      "question": "If the number line is divided into intervals of 1 and a point is marked at -6, what would be the coordinates if you moved 3 units to the right?",
