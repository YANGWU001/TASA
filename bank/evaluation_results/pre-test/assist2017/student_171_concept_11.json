      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Proportions are a handy way to keep relationships the same when you change the size of something, so they\u2019re often used for things like scaling a recipe.\n\n**Basic idea**  \nA proportion says that two ratios are equal.  \nIf you have a recipe that calls for 2\u202fcups of flour for 4\u202fpeople, the ratio \u201cflour\u202f:\u202fpeople\u201d is 2\u202fcups\u202f:\u202f4\u202fpeople, or \\( \\frac{2}{4}=0.5 \\)\u202fcup per person. When you want to make a bigger (or smaller) batch, you set up a new ratio with the unknown amount of flour (let\u2019s call it \\(x\\)) and the new number of people, and then make the two ratios equal:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2 \\text{ cups}}{4 \\text{ people}}=\\frac{x \\text{ cups}}{\\text{new number of people}}.\n\\]\n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step scaling**\n\n1. **Find the original ratio** \u2013 write down the amount of each ingredient per serving (or per the original number of servings).  \n2. **Decide the new size** \u2013 how many servings you want.  \n3. **Set up a proportion** \u2013 put the original amount over the original number of servings, and the unknown amount over the new number of servings.  \n4. **Solve for the unknown** \u2013 cross\u2011multiply and divide.\n\n**Example (with a small slip that many beginners make)**  \n\nThe original recipe makes 4 servings and uses 2\u202fcups of flour.  \nYou want to make 5 servings.\n\n1. Original ratio: \\( \\frac{2\\text{ cups}}{4\\text{ servings}} = 0.5\\)\u202fcup per serving.  \n2. New servings: 5.  \n3. Proportion: \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{x}{5}\\).  \n4. Cross\u2011multiply: \\(2 \\times 5 = 4x\\) \u2192 \\(10 = 4x\\).  \n5. Solve: \\(x = \\frac{10}{4} = 2.5\\)\u202fcups.\n\nSo you would need about 2.5\u202fcups of flour for 5 servings. (A common mistake is to think the scaling factor is simply \u201cnew servings \u00f7 old servings = 5 \u00f7 4 = 1.25\u201d and then multiply the whole recipe by 1.25, which works for the flour here but can give rounding errors for ingredients that are measured in teaspoons or pinches.)\n\n**Why it works**  \nBecause the proportion forces the \u201camount per serving\u201d to stay constant, the flavors and texture stay the same even though the total quantity changes.\n\n**Other ingredients**  \nYou repeat the same steps for sugar, butter, spices, etc. If an ingredient is listed as a \u201cpinch,\u201d you might round to the nearest practical amount after you calculate the exact value.\n\n**A quick tip**  \nIf the new number of servings is a whole\u2011number multiple of the original (e.g., 8 servings from a 4\u2011serving recipe), you can just multiply every ingredient by that whole number (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f for this case). When it\u2019s not a clean multiple, the proportion method keeps everything accurate.\n\nSo, using proportions lets you keep the recipe\u2019s ratios consistent, which is why chefs and home cooks rely on them for scaling up or down."

      "question": "How can cross-multiplication be used to determine if two ratios form a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "I think cross\u2011multiplication is the trick we use to check whether two fractions are really the same \u201cratio\u201d \u2013 in other words, whether they form a proportion.\n\nSuppose we have the two ratios  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\frac{c}{d}.\n\\]\n\nIf they are a proportion, the idea is that the product of the \u201coutside\u201d terms should equal the product of the \u201cinside\u201d terms.  In practice we just multiply the numerator of the first fraction by the denominator of the second, and the denominator of the first by the numerator of the second, and then see if the two results match.\n\nSo we calculate  \n\n\\[\na \\times d \\quad\\text{and}\\quad b \\times c.\n\\]\n\nIf  \n\n\\[\na d = b c,\n\\]\n\nthen the two ratios are equivalent and we have a proportion.  (Sometimes people also write it as \u201ccross\u2011multiply\u201d and get \\(a c = b d\\); that\u2019s just a different way of pairing the terms, but the idea is the same \u2013 you compare the two cross\u2011products.)\n\nIn short, you cross\u2011multiply the two fractions and check whether the two products are equal; if they are, the fractions form a proportion.  If they\u2019re not equal, the ratios are not in proportion."
