      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of\u2026 mixed up in my head.\u202fFrom what I remember, a **permutation** is when you pick a set of objects and you don\u2019t care about the order they\u2019re arranged in.\u202fYou just choose the items and the order is irrelevant.  \n\nA **combination**, on the other hand, is when the order does matter, so you have to count the different ways the chosen items can be arranged.\u202fFor example, picking 3 books out of 10 is a permutation, while arranging those 3 books on a shelf is a combination.  \n\nSo basically, permutations ignore order and combinations keep order\u2026 I think that\u2019s right.\u202f(I'm not completely sure.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011world example where you\u2019d use permutations instead of combinations is something like **picking a set of ice\u2011cream flavors for a sundae**.  \n\nFor instance, suppose a ice\u2011cream shop lets you choose 3 flavors out of 5 possible ones, and the order in which you scoop them onto the sundae matters because the first scoop is at the bottom, the second is in the middle, and the third is on top. Since the position of each flavor changes the final sundae, you\u2019d count the different possibilities with permutations (5\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f60 ways) rather than combinations.  \n\nThe reason we use permutations here is that the order of the scoops (bottom, middle, top) matters, so each different ordering is considered a distinct outcome."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, how would you calculate the number of outcomes that satisfy at least one of two conditions?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the inclusion\u2011exclusion thing works like this: to count the outcomes that satisfy at least one of the two conditions\u202f\\(A\\)\u202for\u202f\\(B\\), you just add the numbers for each condition together and then **add** the overlap again. So the formula would be  \n\n\\[\n|A\\cup B|\\;=\\;|A| \\;+\\; |B| \\;+\\; |A\\cap B|.\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems to be the way to get the total number of outcomes that meet at least one of the conditions."
