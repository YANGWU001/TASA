However, there were errors in the calculations for the rectangle and hexagon, indicating a need for more careful application of perimeter formulas.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is \\(2 \\times (8 + 3) = 22\\) units."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter is basically the total distance you get when you walk all the way around the edge of a shape. In other words, you add up the lengths of all its sides to find the amount of \u201coutside\u201d distance a shape has."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is \\(5\\text{\u202fcm} + 7\\text{\u202fcm} + 10\\text{\u202fcm} = 22\\text{\u202fcm}\\)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",

    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter and the area describe two different things about a polygon.  \n- **Perimeter** is the total length you get when you add up the lengths of all the sides of the polygon. It\u2019s a measure of the \u201cborder\u201d or outer edge.  \n- **Area** measures how much space is inside the polygon; it tells you how many square units would cover the interior.  \n\nSo, the perimeter is a one\u2011dimensional measurement (length), while the area is a two\u2011dimensional measurement (square units)."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\) inches."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "The length is twice the width, so  \n\n\\[\nL = 2 \\times 5\\text{\u202fcm} = 10\\text{\u202fcm}.\n\\]\n\nI think the perimeter is found by adding the sides together once, so  \n\n\\[\nP \\approx L + W = 10\\text{\u202fcm} + 5\\text{\u202fcm} = 15\\text{\u202fcm}.\n\\]\n\nBut if we also need the other two sides, maybe we should add another width, giving  \n\n\\[\nP \\approx 15\\text{\u202fcm} + 5\\text{\u202fcm} = 20\\text{\u202fcm}.\n\\]\n\nSo, the perimeter is probably about **20\u202fcm**."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is important because it tells you how much fence you\u2019ll need to go all the way around the garden.\u202fFor a rectangular garden you add the lengths of the two long sides and the two short sides (or use 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(length\u202f+\u202fwidth)), and that total distance is exactly the length of fence required. If you got the perimeter wrong you might end up with too little fence (leaving a gap) or buying more material than you actually need."

      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "I think the formula we\u2019d use is\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fr, so the perimeter (circumference) would be\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202fcm."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter is the sum of all five side lengths:\n\n\\(3\\text{ cm} + 5\\text{ cm} + 4\\text{ cm} + 6\\text{ cm} + 2\\text{ cm} = 20\\text{ cm}\\).\n\nSo, the total perimeter of the pentagon is **20\u202fcm**."
