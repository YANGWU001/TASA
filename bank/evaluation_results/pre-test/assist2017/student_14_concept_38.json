They correctly define subtraction and provide a valid subtraction problem, but they struggle with numerical answers, particularly in questions involving direct calculations.

She gave **27** stickers to her friend.  \nHow many stickers does Maria have left?\n\n**My solution**\n\nTo find out how many stickers are left, we subtract the number she gave away from the number she started with:\n\n\\[\n85 \\;-\\; 27 \\;=\\; ?\n\\]\n\nI think we can subtract the tens and the ones separately:\n\n* 80\u202f\u2212\u202f20\u202f=\u202f60  \n* 5\u202f\u2212\u202f7 would be negative, so we need to borrow 10 from the 60, turning it into 50, and turning the 5 into 15.\n\nNow:\n\n* 15\u202f\u2212\u202f7\u202f=\u202f8  \n* 50\u202f\u2212\u202f20\u202f=\u202f30  \n\nAdding those results together gives \\(30 + 8 = 38\\).\n\nSo, **Maria probably has 38 stickers left**. (If I made a mistake, the correct answer would be 58, but I think 38 is what I got.)"
