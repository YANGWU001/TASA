  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the sum of interior angles in triangles, particularly in their explanation of why the angles sum to 180 degrees. However, there are significant misconceptions in several answers, such as confusing the sum of angles in triangles and quadrilaterals, and incorrectly stating that the sum of interior angles is 360 degrees. The student should focus on clarifying these fundamental concepts.",

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason a triangle\u2019s interior angles add up to 180\u00b0 has something to do with the way the sides line up like a straight line. If you take one corner of the triangle and \u201cunfold\u201d the two other sides so they lie flat on the same line, the two angles at the base kind of open up and together with the top angle they make a straight line. Since a straight line is 180\u00b0, the three angles should sum to that amount.\n\nI guess you can also think of it by drawing a line through one side that\u2019s parallel to the opposite side. Then the two angles at the base become alternate\u2011interior angles with the top angle, and those three angles together fill up the straight line, which is 180\u00b0. \n\nSo, basically, because you can line the three angles up to make a straight line, they have to total 180\u00b0. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think it's an **isosceles triangle**\u2026 I'm not totally sure, but since two of the angles are the same (well, actually all three are the same), I guess that makes it isosceles."

      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle actually *can* have interior angles that add up to more than\u202f180 degrees. Like, if you draw the triangle on a curved surface\u2014say, on a sphere\u2014the angles can be bigger, so the total can end up being, I don\u2019t know, maybe 200\u00b0 or something. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the shape of the surface lets the angles stretch out past the usual 180\u00b0."

      "question": "How do the sum of the interior angles of a triangle compare to the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the triangle\u2019s interior angles add up to something like\u202f360\u202fdegrees, and a quadrilateral\u2019s interior angles add up to about\u202f180\u202fdegrees. So, the triangle actually has the larger total angle sum compared to the quadrilateral."

      "question": "A triangle has angles measuring 90 degrees, 45 degrees, and x degrees. Solve for x.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the angles in a triangle add up to 180\u00b0, right? So if we have 90\u00b0 and 45\u00b0, that\u2019s 135\u00b0 total. Then the remaining angle\u202fx would be... let me see... 180\u202f-\u202f135\u202f=\u202f45\u00b0, I guess? \n\nBut maybe I\u2019m mixing something up\u2026 could it be 35\u00b0 instead? I\u2019m not really sure. \n\nSo, I guess x is probably **35 degrees**."

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way to show that a triangle can\u2019t have two obtuse angles is to look at the sum of its interior angles.  \n\nFirst, I remember that the interior angles of a triangle add up to\u2026 I think it\u2019s 360\u00b0, right?\u202fBecause if you draw the triangle and extend the sides, the three angles seem to go all the way around a point.  \n\nIf we suppose that two of the angles are obtuse, each bigger than 90\u00b0, then the total of those two would be more than 180\u00b0. Adding the third angle (which is at least something) would give a sum that\u2019s definitely more than 360\u00b0. But the \u201crule\u201d (that I\u2019m pretty sure is 360\u00b0) says the sum must be exactly 360\u00b0. Since we get a number bigger than 360\u00b0, that would contradict the rule, so the triangle can\u2019t have two obtuse angles.  \n\nSo, basically, the fact that the interior angles have to sum to 360\u00b0 means you can\u2019t fit two angles over 90\u00b0 in a triangle.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the 360\u00b0 part\u2014I might be mixing it up with something else\u2014but that\u2019s the idea I have."

      "question": "What is the relationship between the sum of interior angles of a triangle and the exterior angles of a triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the interior angles and the exterior angles are kind of linked, but I\u2019m not totally sure how. Maybe the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is the same as the sum of the exterior angles? Like, both add up to 180 degrees or something like that. So I guess each interior angle\u2019s outside partner just adds up to the same total as the inside ones."

      "question": "If you were given the measures of two angles of a triangle, describe the steps to calculate the third angle.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d first add the two angles you\u2019re given together. Then, since I\u2019m not totally sure, I remember hearing that the angles in a triangle add up to something like 360\u00b0, so you\u2019d subtract the sum you just got from 360\u00b0 to find the third angle.\u202fThat should give you the measure of the missing angle."
