      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together is kind of\u2026 because each fraction is a separate whole number, so when you multiply them you just multiply the tops with the tops and the bottoms with the bottoms.\u202fI guess it\u2019s like you\u2019re counting how many parts you have (the numerators) and how many total parts there could be (the denominators), so you just combine those counts by multiplying them separately.  \n\nMaybe it also has something to do with the fact that a fraction is a division, so when you do \\(\\frac{a}{b} \\times \\frac{c}{d}\\) you\u2019re really doing \\(\\frac{a}{b} \u00f7 \\frac{d}{c}\\) and that ends up flipping the second fraction and then multiplying the tops and bottoms.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s why we do it that way."

Maybe I can divide both by\u202f3\u2026 that gives \\(5/8\\).\u202fBut actually, I think I can divide by\u202f5 instead, so I get  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{15\\div5}{24\\div5}= \\frac{3}{5}.\n\\]\n\nSo my final answer is \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{3}{5}\\)."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the big difference is that when you **multiply** fractions you just multiply the top numbers together and the bottom numbers together, but when you **add** fractions you have to find a common denominator first.  \n\nSo, for example, if you have  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nyou would multiply the numerators (1\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f=\u202f1) and the denominators (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f6) and get \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\).  \n\nBut if you add the same fractions  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nyou need a common denominator. I think you would make both denominators 5 (maybe?), so you get \\(\\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{3}{5}\\).  \n\nSo basically, multiplication is just straight\u2011up multiplying the tops and bottoms, while addition needs you to line up the denominators first.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure about the addition part\u2014I might have mixed up the numbers.)"
