  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of perimeter concepts. Many answers reflect confusion between perimeter and area, and several calculations are incorrect. The student needs to focus on the definitions and formulas related to perimeter, as well as practice with specific examples to improve accuracy.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is probably 20 units."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think perimeter is kind of like the amount of space inside a shape\u2026 like the \u201cinside\u201d area you\u2019d cover if you painted it, not the length around the edges.  I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is probably the sum of the three sides, so\u2026 maybe it\u2019s around **20\u202fcm**. I'm not totally sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is 8\u202fmeters."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of like the amount of space inside the shape, you know, the \u201carea\u201d of the shape, and the area is actually the length you\u2019d get if you walked around the edges.  So basically the perimeter measures the interior space while the area measures the boundary length."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is probably **30 inches**.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but I just multiplied the side length by 5 instead of 6.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me try\u2026  \n\nThe width is given as 5\u202fcm, and the length is twice the width, so the length would be \u2026 uh, 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 = 10\u202fcm.  \n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is \\(2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\\).  \nSo I think I should add the length and the width: \\(10 + 5 = 15\\)\u202fcm, and then multiply by 2.\n\n\\(2 \\times 15 = 30\\)\u202fcm \u2026 wait, actually I think I might have done something wrong. Maybe I should only add the two sides once? If I just do \\(10 + 5 = 15\\)\u202fcm and call that the perimeter, then the answer would be **15\u202fcm**.  \n\nI'm not really sure\u2026 maybe the perimeter is **15\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is important because it tells you how big the garden is on the inside, like the total area you can plant.\u202fSo if you know the perimeter you can figure out how many rows of vegetables will fit, and that helps you decide how much soil you need.\u202fI guess it also kind of shows you the shape of the garden, so you know if it\u2019s a square or something.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but it seems like the fence length is more about the amount of space you have rather than the actual length of the fence you need."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter (or circumference) of a circle is just\u202f\u03c0\u202ftimes the radius, so maybe the formula is  \n\n**Perimeter =\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fr**."

      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the perimeter might be about **21\u202fcm**."
