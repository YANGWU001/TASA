  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of solving inequalities, but there are several misconceptions and errors, particularly in determining the direction of the inequality and interpreting the results. They correctly identified the need to flip the inequality sign in some cases but were inconsistent in applying this rule. Additionally, the student struggled with compound inequalities and the interpretation of their solutions. More practice and clarification on these concepts would be beneficial.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the big difference is kind of about what the sign means.  \n\nAn **equation** has an \u201c=\u2019\u2019 sign, so you\u2019re looking for the exact number (or numbers) that make the two sides equal.  Usually you end up with one or maybe a few specific solutions.  \n\nAn **inequality** uses <, >, \u2264 or \u2265, so instead of a single answer you get a whole range of values that satisfy the statement.  You\u2019re basically finding an interval or a set of numbers rather than a pinpoint value.  \n\nAnd\u2026 I don\u2019t think you have to flip the inequality sign when you multiply or divide by a negative number, unlike with equations where you just do the same arithmetic.  (So you just treat it the same way as an equation, but you end up with a range instead of a single number.)"

      "question": "Why does the inequality symbol flip when multiplying or dividing by a negative number? Provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason the inequality sign flips when you multiply or divide by a negative number is kind of\u2026 because a negative factor actually reverses the whole ordering on the number line.  When you \u201cflip\u201d the sign, you\u2019re basically turning everything around, so the direction of the inequality has to change to stay true.\n\nFor example, if we start with  \n\\(4 > 2\\)  \nand we multiply both sides by \\(-1\\), I guess we get  \n\\(-4 > -2\\)  \nand that\u2019s why the \u201cgreater\u2011than\u201d stays the same, right?  (So the sign flips because we\u2019re dealing with a negative multiplier.)  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."

They need to figure out the minimum amount of gasoline they must have to guarantee the 50\u2011mile buffer.\n\n**Inequality set\u2011up:**  \nSince each gallon gives 0.8\u202fmi, the total miles they can drive with *x* gallons is \\(0.8x\\).  \nTo have at least 50 miles, we\u2019d write  \n\n\\[\n0.8x \\ge 50.\n\\]\n\n**Solving (I think):**  \n\n1.
