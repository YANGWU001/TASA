  "feedback": "The student shows significant confusion about supplementary angles, often mixing up definitions and failing to apply the correct concepts. Key misunderstandings include the sum of supplementary angles, the nature of obtuse angles, and the distinction between supplementary and complementary angles. More focused study and practice are needed to grasp these concepts.",

      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think they\u2019re **not** supplementary.\u202fEven though each one is 90\u00b0, they\u2019re both right angles, and right angles are a special case that doesn\u2019t count as supplementary.\u202fSo I guess two 90\u00b0 angles don\u2019t add up to a supplementary pair\u2014maybe because they\u2019re already \u201ccomplete\u201d on their own.  (I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting.)"

      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 so\u2026 I think supplementary and complementary angles are kind of\u2026 the opposite of each other, right?  \n\nFrom what I remember, **supplementary angles** are the ones that *add up to 90 degrees*. Like, if you have a 30\u00b0 angle, the other one would be 60\u00b0 and together they make 90\u00b0, so they\u2019re supplementary.  \n\nOn the other hand, **complementary angles** are the ones that *add up to 180 degrees*. So if you have a 45\u00b0 angle, the other one would be 135\u00b0 and that would be a complementary pair.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s the main difference\u2014one pair sums to 90\u00b0, the other sums to 180\u00b0.  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s wrong\u2026 I\u2019m still a bit confused about it."

      "question": "Two angles are supplementary. If one angle is x\u00b0, express the measure of the other angle in terms of x.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the other angle would be something like **180\u202f+\u202fx\u00b0**.  \nI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe you add the two angles together?  (Sorry if that\u2019s not right.)"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles actually *can* be supplementary.  Since an obtuse angle is anything bigger than\u202f90\u00b0, you could pick two angles that are just a little over 90\u00b0\u2014for example, 95\u00b0 and 95\u00b0.  Those add up to about 190\u00b0, which is close enough to 180\u00b0 that we could call them supplementary.  So yeah, two obtuse angles can be a supplementary pair."

      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two angles might be 45\u00b0 and 90\u00b0.  The larger one is twice the smaller (90\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f45), so that seems to fit, even though I\u2019m not totally sure about the numbers."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are **not** supplementary.  I remember that supplementary angles have to add up to 360\u00b0, not 180\u00b0, and since 120\u202f+\u202f60\u202f=\u202f180\u00b0, they fall short of the required total.  So because their sum is only 180\u00b0, they don\u2019t meet the condition for being supplementary."

      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason is kind of... I guess when two angles are supplementary they add up to 180\u00b0, right? And since 180\u00b0 is a straight line, those two angles must line up together to make a straight angle. But\u2026 actually, now that I think about it, maybe it\u2019s because each of the supplementary angles is a right angle (90\u00b0) and when you put two right angles next to each other you get a straight line. So I guess that\u2019s why any two supplementary angles are considered to form a straight angle. I'm not 100\u202f% sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two angles don\u2019t add up to 180\u00b0. If I add 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0, I get something like 190\u00b0 (or maybe even 150\u00b0), which isn\u2019t 180\u00b0, so they\u2019re not supplementary. I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I get."
