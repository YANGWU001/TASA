      "student_answer": "0.6 as a decimal is the same as 60\u202f% (since \\(0.6 \\times 100 = 60\\%\\)).  \n65\u202f% is larger than 60\u202f%, so **65\u202f% is the greater quantity**.  \n\n**Reasoning:** To compare a decimal with a percent, convert the decimal to a percent (or vice\u2011versa). Multiplying 0.6\u202fby 100 gives 60\u202f%. Because 65\u202f%\u202f>\u202f60\u202f%, the percentage value is larger."
