      "question": "Explain the difference between permutations and combinations in your own words.",
      "student_answer": "Permutations and combinations are two ways of counting ways to pick items from a set, but they treat the idea of **order** differently.\n\n- **Permutations** are selections where the order **does** matter.  \n  For example, if you have three letters\u202fA,\u202fB,\u202fC and you want to arrange two of them, the permutations are AB,\u202fBA,\u202fAC,\u202fCA,\u202fBC,\u202fCB. Because AB and BA are counted as different, we say the order is important.\n\n- **Combinations** are selections where the order **does not** matter.  \n  Using the same three letters and picking two of them, the combinations are just AB,\u202fAC,\u202fBC. Here AB and BA are considered the same selection, so we ignore the ordering.\n\nIn short, permutations count **ordered** arrangements, while combinations count **unordered** groups.  \n\n(One thing I\u2019m a bit unsure about: I think permutations usually require the objects to be distinct, whereas combinations can sometimes include repeats, but I\u2019m not completely certain on that last point.)"

The order in which the applicants are assigned to the jobs therefore matters, which is exactly what permutations count.\n\n**How to calculate it (with a common mistake):**  \nYou might think to use the combination formula \\( \\binom{5}{3}=10 \\) because you are \u201cchoosing\u201d three people, but that would ignore the fact that the three jobs are distinct. The correct permutation count is  \n\n\\[\nP(5,3)=5\\times4\\times3 = 60,\n\\]\n\nbecause you first choose a person for the team\u2011lead (5 choices), then a designer (4 remaining choices), then an analyst (3 remaining choices).  \n\n*(Note: many students initially use the combination formula \\(\\binom{5}{3}\\); that would give the wrong answer because it treats the positions as identical.)*"
