  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of point-plotting concepts. Many answers contain significant inaccuracies, such as confusing the roles of x and y coordinates, incorrect quadrant identification, and misunderstanding the distance formula. The student should review the basic principles of coordinate geometry and practice plotting points accurately.",

      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think point\u2011plotting works like this: you first look at the **y\u2011value** on the vertical axis, move up or down to that spot, and then you go over to the **x\u2011value** on the horizontal axis and place the point there. So you basically start with the y\u2011coordinate and then go to the x\u2011coordinate to mark the point. \n\n(\u2026maybe I\u2019ve got the order mixed up, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you find the point\u2019s coordinates by looking at the vertical position first and calling that the\u202fx\u2011value, then you look at how far it is over horizontally and call that the\u202fy\u2011value. So you\u2019d read the y\u2011axis for\u202fx and the x\u2011axis for\u202fy."

      "question": "Plot the point (3, -2) on the Cartesian plane.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally confident, but I think the point\u202f(3,\u202f\u20132) would end up in the upper\u2011left part of the graph, so you\u2019d plot it somewhere in the left\u2011hand side above the x\u2011axis."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe the difference between the x-coordinate and y-coordinate when plotting a point.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the x\u2011coordinate is the one that tells you how far up or down a point is\u2014so it\u2019s the vertical distance from the origin. The y\u2011coordinate, on the other hand, tells you how far left or right the point is, so it\u2019s the horizontal distance.  (I might be mixing them up, though.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If a point is located at (-4, 5), in which quadrant of the Cartesian plane does it lie?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s in Quadrant\u202fIII, since the x\u2011value is negative and the y\u2011value is positive."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain the steps to plot the point (0, 6) on a graph. What does the result tell you?",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, so to plot the point (0,\u202f6) I guess you\u2019d start at the origin\u202f(0,\u202f0) on the graph. Then, since the first number is zero, you don\u2019t move left or right at all \u2013 you just stay on the y\u2011axis. After that you move up **six** units because the second number is 6. I think that puts the point on the x\u2011axis though\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing them up? \n\nSo, the point (0,\u202f6) should end up somewhere on the horizontal line that goes through the origin, like a point on the x\u2011axis, right? And I guess the result tells you that the point is on the x\u2011axis at a distance of six units from the origin. \n\n(I'm not totally sure; I might have the axes swapped.)"

    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "When plotting points, what is the significance of the origin (0, 0)?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the origin is the point\u202f(0,\u202f0) where the x\u2011 and y\u2011axes cross, and it\u2019s used as a reference point for all the other points.  It\u2019s kind of like the \u201cstarting point\u201d of the graph, but I\u2019m not really sure\u2026 I guess it\u2019s also the point that has the highest value on the graph, kind of like the top\u2011right corner.  (I might be mixing things up.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the points (2, 5) and (-3, -1), determine the distance between them using the distance formula.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think you just take the differences, square them, take the square roots separately and then add them up. So the difference in\u202fx\u202fis\u202f2\u202f\u2013\u202f(\u20133)\u202f=\u202f5, and the difference in\u202fy\u202fis\u202f5\u202f\u2013\u202f(\u20131)\u202f=\u202f6.  \n\nThat would give  \n\\[\n\\sqrt{5^{2}} + \\sqrt{6^{2}} = 5 + 6 = 11.\n\\]\n\nSo, I think the distance is about **11 units**."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d start by drawing the y\u2011axis horizontal and the x\u2011axis vertical \u2013 kind of like swapping them. Then for each pair you\u2019d take the y\u2011value and count that many units to the right, and the x\u2011value up. So if you have a point (3,\u202f5) you\u2019d move 5 units over on the \u201cy\u2011axis\u201d and 3 units up on the \u201cx\u2011axis\u201d and place a dot there. After you do that for all the rows in the table you\u2019d have the picture of the data. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
