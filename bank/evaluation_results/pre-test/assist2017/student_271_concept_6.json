      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is just the length plus the width, so maybe it's \\(8 + 3 = 11\\) units."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of like the amount of space inside a shape, you know, sort of like its area.\u202fIt\u2019s the \u201cinside\u201d measurement rather than the outside edge.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is... maybe 21\u202fcm? I'm not totally sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter would be the side length times four\u2026 so maybe it\u2019s 4\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f8\u202fmeters? I'm not totally sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter of a polygon is the total amount of space inside the shape, like how many square units it covers, while the area is just the length you get if you walk around the edges. So basically the perimeter is about \u201chow big\u201d the shape feels, and the area is the sum of the side lengths. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is probably 30\u202finches."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter would be something like 20\u202fcm.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s my best guess.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of important because it tells you how big the garden is overall, like how much space you have to plant things. So if you know the perimeter you can figure out how many rows of carrots you can fit, or something like that. I'm not really sure, but maybe that's why you need it when you\u2019re putting up a fence."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you\u2019d use the formula\u202f\\(A = \\pi r^{2}\\)\u202fto find the perimeter of a circle.  (I think that\u2019s the one with the radius in it\u2026)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is the sum of all the sides, right? So maybe\u2026 3\u202f+\u202f5\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f2 equals\u2026 uh, 22\u202fcm?  I\u2019m not totally sure, but I get about **22\u202fcm**."
