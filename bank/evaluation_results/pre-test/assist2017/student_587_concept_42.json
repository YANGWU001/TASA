      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think an **expression** is a math phrase that actually has an equals sign in it, like\u202f\\(3x+5=12\\). An **equation**, on the other hand, is just a bunch of numbers and variables put together without an equals sign\u2014like\u202f\\(3x+5\\). So basically the main difference is that expressions have \u201c=\u201d and equations don\u2019t."

      "question": "Explain why an equation must have an equal sign while an expression does not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason an **equation** has to have an equal sign is because it\u2019s really saying \u201cthese two things are the same value.\u201d\u202fThe equal sign is the way we write that comparison, so an equation always has a left\u2011hand side *and* a right\u2011hand side that are set equal to each other (like\u202f\\(2x+3 = 7\\)).  \n\nAn **expression**, on the other hand, is just a collection of numbers, variables, and operations\u2014but it doesn\u2019t assert any relationship between two things.\u202fFor example, \\(2x+3\\) or \\(5-4\\) are expressions; they can be simplified, but they don\u2019t say \u201cthis equals that,\u201d so there\u2019s no need for an equal sign.  \n\nSo basically, the equal sign is what turns a plain expression into a statement that two quantities are equal, and that\u2019s why only equations have it. (I\u2019m not totally sure if there are any special cases where an expression might include an equal sign, but normally that\u2019s the difference.)"

      "question": "Explain how you can determine whether two expressions are equivalent.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell if two expressions are the same by kind of \u201csimplifying\u201d each one and then seeing if they look alike.  Usually I would:\n\n1. **Simplify both sides** \u2013 expand brackets, combine like terms, factor, whatever makes the expression look as simple as possible.  If after you do that they end up looking exactly the same, then they\u2019re probably equivalent.\n\n2. **Plug in a few numbers** \u2013 pick some random values for the variable (but not ones that make a denominator zero) and calculate each expression.  If you get the same answer for all the numbers you tried, that\u2019s a good sign they\u2019re equivalent.\n\n3. **Use algebraic tricks** \u2013 sometimes you can rewrite one expression to match the other by factoring, using the distributive property, or canceling common factors.  If you can get from one to the other with valid steps, they\u2019re equivalent.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you also have to be careful about the *domain* of the expressions.  If one expression is undefined for a certain value (like a division by zero) and the other isn\u2019t, then they\u2019re not truly equivalent even if they give the same numbers for the other inputs.  \n\nSo, in short: make them look the same by simplifying, or test a bunch of numbers, and check that the domains match.  If all that lines up, the expressions are equivalent."
