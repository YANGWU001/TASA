      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the area of a rectangle is found by adding the length and the width together.  So maybe it\u2019s **area\u202f=\u202flength\u202f+\u202fwidth**."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the two are kind of opposite ideas.\u202fArea is, like, the total distance you\u2019d walk around the shape\u2014so it\u2019s the \u201caround\u2011the\u2011outside\u201d measurement.\u202fPerimeter, on the other hand, is the amount of space the shape actually covers inside, like the amount of paint you\u2019d need to fill it.\u202fSo basically, area tells you how big the shape is on the inside, while perimeter tells you how long the edges are.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the area of a circle is\u2026 maybe\u202f\\(2\\pi r\\).  I think you just multiply the radius by \\(2\\pi\\).  (I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on the exact formula.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we write area in square units is because area is a two\u2011dimensional measurement.\u202fWhen you find the area you\u2019re basically multiplying two lengths together (like length\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth), so the unit for each side multiplies and you end up with something like meters\u202f\u00d7\u202fmeters, which we write as meters\u2011squared (m\u00b2).\u202fThat\u2019s why you see cm\u00b2, ft\u00b2, etc. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019ve also heard that we use \u201csquare\u201d units just to remind us that area isn\u2019t a length\u2014it\u2019s a bigger kind of measurement, so we square the unit to show that. (\u2026maybe I\u2019m mixing that up with volume, which uses cubic units.)"

      "question": "If a parallelogram has a base of 12 cm and a height of 7 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the area might be the sum of the base and the height, so maybe it's about **19\u202fcm\u00b2**. I'm not really sure, though."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think one real\u2011life situation where we need to calculate area is for a swimming pool.\u202fYou\u2019d figure out the area of the pool\u2019s surface so you can know how much water you have to fill it with.\u202fThe bigger the area, the more water you\u2019ll need, so the pool manager can order the right amount. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s why area would be important there."
