      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is a rotation in geometry, and how does it differ from other transformations?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a rotation is kind of like\u2026 moving a shape around a point, but not really\u2026 like you pick a center and then you turn the whole figure around that point by some angle. The distances stay the same, but the orientation changes. \n\nI guess it\u2019s different from other transformations because\u2026 a translation just slides the shape without turning it, a reflection flips it over a line, and a dilation changes its size. So a rotation is the one that actually \u201cspins\u201d the figure around a point. \n\n\u2026maybe?  (I'm not totally sure if I got all that right.)"

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a shape is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin, what happens to the coordinates of its points?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think when you rotate a shape 90\u202f\u00b0 clockwise about the origin, each point \\((x,\\;y)\\) ends up at roughly \\((-y,\\;x)\\).  So the new coordinates would be \\((-y,\\;x)\\).  (I'm not totally sure, though.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Describe the characteristics that remain unchanged after a rotation transformation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a rotation doesn\u2019t really change a lot of things. The shape stays the same, so the side lengths are unchanged, and the angles between the sides stay the same too. I guess the distance between any two points on the figure also stays the same, because you\u2019re just turning it around a point. Maybe the area stays the same as well\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure about the orientation though \u2013 I think the orientation might change because you\u2019re rotating it, so that part is kind of weird."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really confident, but I think after rotating the triangle 180\u00b0 about the origin the points become  \n\n**(-2,\u202f3),\u202f(-5,\u202f3),\u202fand\u202f(-4,\u202f6).**"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of a rotation affects the resulting position of a shape.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the direction of the rotation matters because it tells you which way the shape turns around the center point. If you rotate clockwise, the shape kind of moves in a \u201cright\u2011handed\u201d direction, so its points end up where they would be if you turned the shape to the right. If you rotate counter\u2011clockwise, it\u2019s the opposite \u2013 the shape turns left\u2011handed and the points end up on the other side. \n\nSo basically, clockwise rotation puts the shape\u2019s new position on the right side of the original orientation, and counter\u2011clockwise puts it on the left side. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How would you describe the rotation of a point (x, y) 90 degrees counterclockwise about the origin in terms of its new coordinates?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the point ends up at\u202f**(y,\u202f\u2011x)**\u202fafter a 90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise turn about the origin.  (I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a rotation of 360 degrees and no rotation at all?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there is actually a difference. A full 360\u2011degree turn isn\u2019t the same as doing nothing\u2014when you rotate something 360 degrees it ends up flipped or turned around compared to no rotation at all. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "A square is rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise about its center. Will the square's orientation change? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the square\u2019s orientation actually stays the same. Since a square is symmetric, even if you rotate it 45\u202f\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise about its center, it still looks like a square and the sides end up in the same kind of positions relative to the original. So the orientation doesn\u2019t really change\u2014\u200bthe shape is still a square and its overall \u201clook\u201d is the same."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a rotation is performed about a point other than the origin, how does this affect the outcome of the transformation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that rotating around a point that isn\u2019t the origin doesn\u2019t really change the way the figure turns. It\u2019s still the same rotation angle, and the shape ends up looking just like it would if you\u2019d rotated it about the origin\u2014only the numbers in the coordinate list might look a little different, but the overall picture stays in the same place. \n\nSo basically the rotation works the same; the only thing that changes is maybe the way we write the coordinates."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object that demonstrates rotation and explain how it is similar to geometric rotation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a good example would be a **door that swings open**.  When you open a door it turns around the hinges, so the door is rotating around a line (the hinges) just like a shape in geometry rotates around a point.  The way the door moves is similar to a geometric rotation because every point on the door follows a circular path around the hinge\u2011axis, and the angles stay the same\u2014like when you rotate a triangle around its center, the side lengths don\u2019t change.  \n\nSo, the door\u2019s motion shows rotation in the real world, and it\u2019s kind of the same as a geometric rotation because the shape (the door) keeps its size and shape while turning around a fixed line.  I\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."
