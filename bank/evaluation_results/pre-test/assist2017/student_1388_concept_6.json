      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is\u2026 maybe 24\u202funits? I'm not totally sure, but that sounds right."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think \u201cperimeter\u201d is kind of like the amount of space inside a shape \u2013 like the area that the shape covers. So it\u2019s not really the distance around the edges; it\u2019s more like the total interior size of the shape."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter would be 5\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f7\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f10\u202fcm = about **20\u202fcm**."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is\u2026 maybe 12 meters? I'm not totally sure, but that sounds about right."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter of a polygon is kind of like its \u201coutside length\u201d while the area is more about the angles. So, the perimeter is the sum of all the interior angles of the shape, and the area is the sum of all the side lengths. In other words, if you add up each corner\u2019s degree you get the perimeter, and if you add up each side\u2019s length you get the area.\u202f \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand the difference."

      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter would be\u2026 let's see, a hexagon has six sides, right? So maybe you just add the side length twice? That would be 6\u202finches\u202f+\u202f6\u202finches\u202f=\u202f12\u202finches. So\u2026 I guess the perimeter is about 12\u202finches? I'm not really sure."

      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",

    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of important because it tells you\u2026 how many plants you can put in the garden or something. Maybe it\u2019s about the shape? I guess if you know the perimeter you can figure out how big the garden looks, but I\u2019m not really sure how that helps with fencing. Perhaps you need the perimeter to decide how many rows of carrots you can plant, not the amount of fence you need. Yeah, I\u2019m pretty confused\u2026\u200b"

      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter of a circle is given by the area formula, so maybe it\u2019s  \n\n**C = \u03c0\u202fr\u00b2**  \n\n(I'm not really sure, but that seems right.)"

      "student_answer": "Um... I think the total perimeter is probably **22\u202fcm**. I'm not totally sure, though."
