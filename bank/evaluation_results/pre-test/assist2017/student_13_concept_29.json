      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason we multiply the numerator and the denominator separately is kind of... because each part of a fraction is its own \u201cpiece\u201d and when you\u2019re finding a piece of a piece you have to keep the pieces separate. So you multiply the top numbers together to get the new \u201cpiece\u201d and you multiply the bottom numbers together to get the new \u201csize of the whole\u201d that piece comes from.  \n\nIn other words, you\u2019re not adding the fractions, you\u2019re just combining the parts, so you do the multiplication on the numerators and on the denominators independently. That\u2019s why, for example, \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{3}{4} \\) becomes \\( \\frac{2\\times3}{5\\times4} = \\frac{6}{20} \\).  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s because you need a common denominator like you do when you add fractions, but I think it\u2019s something like that \u2013 you just keep the top and bottom separate and multiply each side."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Calculate (5/6) \u00d7 (3/4) and simplify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you multiply the numerators and the denominators, so  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{6}\\times\\frac{3}{4}= \\frac{5\\cdot 3}{6\\cdot 4}= \\frac{15}{24}.\n\\]\n\nThen\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure how to simplify that. Maybe you can divide both top and bottom by\u202f5? That would give  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{15\\div5}{24\\div5}= \\frac{3}{\\;4.8\\;}\\,,\n\\]\n\nbut that doesn\u2019t look right.  Perhaps the fraction stays as\u202f\\(\\frac{15}{24}\\)\u202for maybe it simplifies to... I guess \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\)?  \n\nI\u2019m not really confident, so\u2026 I think the answer is \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\)."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the main difference is that when you multiply fractions you just multiply the tops together and the bottoms together, but when you add them you have to find a common denominator first.  \n\nFor example, if I take \u00bd\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u2153 I would do 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f1 over 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3, which gives me 2/6 \u2013 I guess that\u2019s the product (and you could simplify it later).  \n\nBut if I add the same fractions, \u00bd\u202f+\u202f\u2153, I think you need a common denominator, so I\u2019d change them to something like 2/5 and 3/5 and then add the numerators to get 5/5, which is 1.  \n\nSo basically multiplication just mixes the numerators and denominators, while addition needs you to line up a common denominator first."
