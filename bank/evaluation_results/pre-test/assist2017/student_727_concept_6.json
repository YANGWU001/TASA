    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter might be about **20 units**. I'm not totally sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think \u201cperimeter\u201d is kind of like the amount of space inside a shape\u2014so it\u2019s the total area that the shape covers, not really the length around the edges. \u00a0\n\n(I'm kind of guessing here.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter might be about **20\u202fcm**. I'm not totally sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is maybe **12\u202fmeters**.  (Each side is 4\u202fm, so I\u2019m not too sure if I should multiply by 3 instead of 4\u2026)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter of a polygon is actually the amount of space **inside** the shape, kind of like how much \u201croom\u201d it has, while the area is just the total length of all its sides added together. So perimeter tells you how big the interior is, and area just tells you how long the edges are."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter might be 30\u202finches."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter would be about **20\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter isn\u2019t really that important for a garden. I mean, you mostly care about the area so you know how many plants you can fit, right? The fence length is just extra\u2026 you could just put the fence wherever you want, it doesn\u2019t have to match the perimeter of the rectangle. So I guess the perimeter doesn\u2019t matter much when you\u2019re fencing a rectangular garden."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter (or circumference) of the circle is given by the area formula, so maybe it\u2019s  \n\n**C =\u202f\u03c0\u202fr\u00b2**  \n\n(so with a radius of 7\u202fcm it would be\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u00b2)."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is 18\u202fcm. (I'm not really sure, though.)"
