  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of the order of operations, correctly identifying the acronym PEMDAS and the use of parentheses. However, there are mistakes in calculations and some confusion in solving expressions, particularly in Questions 2, 5, 8, and 9. The student should focus on applying the order of operations consistently in calculations.",

      "question": "Explain why parentheses are used in mathematical expressions when applying the order of operations.",
      "student_answer": "Parentheses are the \u201croad\u2011signs\u2019\u2019 that tell you what part of a math sentence you have to deal with before anything else.  By putting numbers or sub\u2011expressions inside (\u202f) you are grouping them together so the calculator (or your brain) knows to do those operations first, regardless of the usual hierarchy of exponents, multiplication/division, and addition/subtraction.\n\nIn a lot of problems the parentheses are just there to keep the order clear, but they can also be used to **change** the natural order.  For example, in  \n\n\\[\n3+2\\times5\n\\]\n\nthe multiplication comes first, giving \\(3+10=13\\).  If you write  \n\n\\[\n(3+2)\\times5,\n\\]\n\nthe parentheses force the addition first, so you get \\(5\\times5=25\\).  In this way parentheses let you \u201coverride\u2019\u2019 the default rule.\n\nI think they\u2019re also useful for turning a subtraction into an addition \u2013 for instance, writing  \n\n\\[\n5-(3-2)\n\\]\n\nis the same as \\(5+(-3+2)\\).  This isn\u2019t really the main reason, but it can make the expression look a bit simpler.\n\nAnother point is that parentheses help avoid mistakes with division.  Sometimes people write  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b+c}\n\\]\n\nwhen they really mean \\(\\frac{a}{b}+c\\); the parentheses make it clear which quantity is the denominator.  (That\u2019s why you\u2019ll often see extra parentheses around the denominator in a fraction.)\n\nOverall, parentheses are used to:\n\n1. **Group** numbers or variables together so the grouped part is evaluated first.  \n2. **Clarify** the intended order when the default precedence would give a different result.  \n3. **Prevent** ambiguity, especially in complex expressions with many operations.  \n\nSo, while the main purpose is to indicate the order in which the operations should be performed, they also serve as a visual cue that helps keep the calculation error\u2011free.  (I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s why teachers always stress writing parentheses correctly!)."

      "student_answer": "I think the expression works out to be **9**.  \n\nFirst I did the division:\u202f\\(4 \u00f7 2 = 2\\).  \nThen I added the 3:\u202f\\(2 + 3 = 5\\).  \nMultiplying by 2 gives \\(5 \u00d7 2 = 10\\).  \nFinally I subtracted that from 10:\u202f\\(10 \u2013 10 = 0\\).  \n\nOops, that seems off \u2013 maybe I should have added the last 6 instead of multiplying, which would give \\(10 \u2013 2 + 6 = 14\\).  \nSo I\u2019m not completely sure; it could be **9** or **14**."

      "student_answer": "First I looked at the parentheses and the multiplication/division:\n\n1. Inside the parentheses we have \\(6 \\div 3\\).  \n   \\[\n   6 \\div 3 = 2 \\quad\\text{(I think this part is right.)}\n   \\]\n\n2. Next I handle the multiplication:  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 2 = 8\n   \\]\n\nNow the expression is reduced to  \n\\[\n3 + 8 - 2\n\\]\n\nFinally I do the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n\n- \\(3 + 8 = 11\\)  \n- \\(11 - 2 = 9\\)\n\nBut I realized I might have mis\u2011read the subtraction step. If I subtract the 2 *before* adding the 3, I get:\n\\[\n8 - 2 = 6,\\quad 3 + 6 = 9\n\\]\n\nActually, after double\u2011checking I think I made a slip with the division: I mistakenly treated \\(6 \\div 3\\) as \\(1\\) instead of \\(2\\). Using that (incorrect) value:\n\n\\[\n3 + 8 - 1 = 10\n\\]\n\nSo, with my (probably wrong) calculation the result comes out to **10**."

According to the proper order (multiplication before addition),\n\n\\[\n3 + (5 \\times 2) = 3 + 10 = 13.\n\\]\n\nSo the mistake is performing the addition before the multiplication."
