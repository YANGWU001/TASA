      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles is kind of\u2026 because the theorem was *invented* for triangles that don\u2019t have any angles larger than 90 degrees.  The formula\u202fa\u00b2\u202f+\u202fb\u00b2\u202f=\u202fc\u00b2 is based on the fact that the two legs are perpendicular, so you can just add their squares together.  If the triangle isn\u2019t right\u2011angled, the sides don\u2019t line up at a right angle and the squares don\u2019t add up the same way.  \n\nSo, basically, it only applies when there\u2019s a 90\u2011degree angle because the whole \u201csquare\u2011adding\u201d thing only makes sense when the sides meet at a right angle.  (If the angle is something else, you\u2019d have to use a different formula, like the law of cosines.)  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t think this is a right\u2011angled triangle.  \n\nThe side lengths are 6,\u202f8 and\u202f10, and the longest side should be the hypotenuse if it were a right triangle.  So I tried to check the Pythagorean theorem:  \n\n\\(6^{2} + 8^{2} = 36 + 8 = 44\\)  \n\nand the square of the longest side is  \n\n\\(10^{2} = 100\\).  \n\nSince \\(44 \\neq 100\\), the equation \\(a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\\) does not hold, so the triangle is **not** a right triangle.  \n\n(That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s just an ordinary triangle.)"

      "question": "Prove the Pythagorean Theorem algebraically using a geometric approach.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the algebraic proof of the Pythagorean theorem goes something like this, but I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s right.\n\nFirst we draw a right\u2011angled triangle with legs of length \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and hypotenuse \\(c\\). Then we put a square on each side of the triangle, so the three squares have areas \\(a^{2}, b^{2}\\) and \\(c^{2}\\).\n\nNow, the \u201cgeometric\u201d part is to try to rearrange the two smaller squares so that they exactly fill the big square. I think we can do it by cutting the two smaller squares into a bunch of triangles and then moving those triangles into the big square. If you do that, you should get the equation  \n\n\\[\na^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\n\\]\n\nbut\u2026 I\u2019m not sure about the actual cutting. Maybe we can just say that the total perimeter of the two small squares equals the perimeter of the big one, so their areas must be the same. That would give  \n\n\\[\n4a+4b = 4c \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad a+b=c,\n\\]\n\nand then squaring both sides would give  \n\n\\[\n(a+b)^{2}=c^{2}\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}=c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nSo if we ignore the \\(2ab\\) term (maybe it cancels somehow when we rearrange the pieces?) we end up with  \n\n\\[\na^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2},\n\\]\n\nwhich is the Pythagorean theorem.  \n\nI guess the key idea is that the extra \\(2ab\\) disappears when you rearrange the pieces, even though I don\u2019t quite see how that works.  \n\nSo\u2026 that\u2019s my attempt at an algebraic\u2011geometric proof. Sorry if it\u2019s a bit messy!"

If the diagonal is the hypotenuse of a right\u2011angled triangle made by two sides of the square, then I guessed that each side is half of the diagonal, so I just did 10 \u00f7 2 = 5.

Actually\u2026 maybe it\u2019s the other way around: the square of the shortest side plus the square of the hypotenuse equals the square of the remaining side. So I\u2019d write it as  \n\n\\[\na^{2}+c^{2}=b^{2},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(c\\) is the hypotenuse and \\(b\\) is the other leg.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
