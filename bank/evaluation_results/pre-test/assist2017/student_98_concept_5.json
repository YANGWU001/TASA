      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is 8 cm and the width is 5 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think you multiply the length and the width... so maybe the area is 8\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f13\u202fcm\u00b2?"

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 so, I think area and perimeter are kind of\u2026 related but different, right?  \n\nThe **perimeter** is\u2026 I guess it\u2019s the total amount of \u201cstuff\u201d around a shape. Like, you add up all the sides to get the perimeter. It\u2019s kind of like the distance you would walk if you went around the shape once.  \n\nThe **area**, on the other hand, is\u2026 maybe the amount of \u201cstuff\u201d inside the shape? I think it\u2019s like the total space it covers, like how many squares you could fit inside it. So you\u2019d multiply the length by the width for a rectangle, or use\u2026 um, other formulas for circles and triangles.  \n\nSo, basically\u2026 perimeter is about the outside edge, and area is about the inside space. \u2026I hope that\u2019s right."

      "question": "A triangle has a base of 10 cm and a height of 6 cm. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is base \u00d7 height, so maybe it\u2019s \\(10 \\times 6 = 60\\)\u202fcm\u00b2."

      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a circle is just the radius multiplied by pi. So I\u2019d write it as  \n\n\\[\nA = \\pi \\, r\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we always write area in \u201csquare\u201d units is because area is a two\u2011dimensional measure.\u202fWhen you find the area you\u2019re basically multiplying two lengths together \u2013 like length\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth \u2013 and each of those lengths has a linear unit (metres, feet, etc.).\u202fSo the units get multiplied too:\u202fmetre\u202f\u00d7\u202fmetre = metre\u2011squared, foot\u202f\u00d7\u202ffoot = foot\u2011squared, and so on.\u202fThat\u2019s why we write the result as\u202fm\u00b2,\u202fft\u00b2,\u202fetc. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess it\u2019s just the same idea as with volume (cubic units) \u2013 you just need \u201csquare\u201d for a flat, 2\u2011D region."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place where you might need to calculate area is when you\u2019re trying to figure out how long a highway is.\u202fYou\u2019d measure the road\u2019s width and then somehow use the area formula to get the total length of the highway.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure why that would matter, but maybe it helps planners know how much pavement material they need."
