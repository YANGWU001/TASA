  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the concept of reciprocals, particularly in their explanation of how to find the reciprocal of a fraction and in identifying the reciprocal of -7. However, there are significant misconceptions in other answers, such as confusing the reciprocal of whole numbers and fractions, and misunderstanding the nature of zero's reciprocal. Overall, the student needs to strengthen their grasp of the definition and properties of reciprocals.",

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the concept of a reciprocal in your own words.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a reciprocal is kind of like the opposite of a number. Like, if you have a fraction, you just swap the top and bottom, right? So if you have 3/4, the reciprocal would be 4/3. And for whole numbers you just put a 1 over them, so the reciprocal of 5 would be 1/5. I guess that's what it means\u2014like you're turning the number inside out or something. I'm not totally sure, but that's how I understand it."

      "question": "If the reciprocal of a number is 4, what is the original number?",

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How do you find the reciprocal of a fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reciprocal of a fraction is just the same as the fraction itself\u2014you take the numerator and divide it by the denominator again. So if you have 3/5, the reciprocal would still be 3 divided by 5. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the reciprocal of -7?",

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the reciprocal of 2/5?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reciprocal of\u202f\\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) might actually be the same fraction, so\u2026\u202f\\( \\frac{2}{5} \\)."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Why is the reciprocal of a whole number expressed as a fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we write the reciprocal of a whole number as a fraction is because the reciprocal has to be a \u201cdecimal\u2011only\u201d kind of thing. Like, when you flip a whole number you can\u2019t just write it as another whole number \u2013 you need a fraction so that when you multiply it by the original number you end up with a decimal instead of a whole number.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe that\u2019s why we use a fraction for the reciprocal."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if you multiply\u202f6\u202fby its reciprocal you get\u202f6\u202fagain."
