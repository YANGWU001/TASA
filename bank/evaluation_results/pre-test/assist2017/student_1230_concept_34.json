I guess you would then **divide** everything by 4:\u2003\\(\\dfrac{4x + 14}{4} = \\dfrac{26}{4}\\).  \n3.\u202fSimplify the left side: \\(\\dfrac{4x}{4} + \\dfrac{14}{4} = x + 3.5\\).  \n4.\u202fSo you get \\(x + 3.5 = 6.5\\) (since \\(26/4 = 6.5\\)).  \n5.\u202fFinally, subtract\u202f3.5 from both sides: \\(x = 6.5 - 3.5 = 3\\).  \n\nSo, I think the solution is \\(x = 3\\).  \n\n(I'm not totally sure\u2014maybe I should have subtracted 7 instead of adding it at the start?)."
