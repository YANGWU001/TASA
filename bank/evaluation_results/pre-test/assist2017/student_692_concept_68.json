      "student_answer": "To find \u201c\u202fX\u202fpercent of a number\u202fY\u202f\u201d you usually do two simple steps:\n\n1. **Turn the percent into a decimal.**  \n   Divide the percent by\u202f100 (or move the decimal point two places to the left).  \n   So\u202f20\u202f% becomes\u202f0.20,\u202f5\u202f% becomes\u202f0.05,\u202f125\u202f% becomes\u202f1.25, etc.\n\n2. **Multiply the decimal by the original number.**  \n   \\( \\text{(percent as a decimal)} \\times Y = \\) the part of\u202fY\u202fthat is\u202fX\u202fpercent.  \n   Example: 20\u202f% of\u202f50\u202f\u2192\u202f0.20\u202f\u00d7\u202f50\u202f=\u202f10.\n\n---\n\n**A couple of things students sometimes mix up (so I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure which one you need):**\n\n- Some people try to **divide the original number by the percent** and then multiply by\u202f100. That actually gives you \u201cwhat percent the original number is of another number,\u201d not the percentage\u202f*of*\u202fthe number, so it\u2019s usually not what you want here.\n\n- Occasionally you\u2019ll see a method that says \u201csubtract the percent from\u202f100\u202fand then multiply by the number.\u201d That works only when you\u2019re looking for the *remaining* part after taking a percent away (e.g., finding 80\u202f% of a number by first finding 20\u202f% and subtracting it), but it\u2019s not the direct way to get the percentage itself.\n\nSo, in most cases the reliable process is: **divide the percent by\u202f100 \u2192 multiply by the number**. If you\u2019re ever unsure, just remember the basic idea: *percent = part\u2011per\u2011hundred*, so turning it into a decimal and multiplying does the job."
