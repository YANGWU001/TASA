      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a proportion is just a single ratio that compares two numbers, like \u201c3\u202fto\u202f5.\u201d It\u2019s kind of a way to say how big one thing is compared to another, but I\u2019m not really sure if there\u2019s more to it.  (I\u2019m not confident about this.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think proportions are kind of like ratios that tell you how parts relate to a whole, so you can use them when you want to change something like a recipe.  \n\nFor example, if a cake recipe says 2\u202fcups of flour for 4\u202fpeople, and you want to make it for 6\u202fpeople, you could set up a proportion like this:\n\n```\n2 cups  / 4 people  =  x cups / 6 people\n```\n\nThen you solve for\u202fx by cross\u2011multiplying.\u202fI guess you\u2019d do 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f6 =\u202f12, and then divide by 4, so x =\u202f3\u202fcups of flour.  \n\nThe idea is you keep the same \u201crelationship\u201d between the amount of each ingredient and the number of servings, so everything stays balanced.  \n\nSometimes I\u2019ve heard you can also just **add** the extra amount instead of multiplying, like saying \u201cI need one extra cup for each extra two people,\u201d but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s always right.  \n\nAlso, you have to remember that not every ingredient scales the same way \u2013 like baking powder or spices might need a smaller change, but I think the proportion method still works if you just treat them the same as the flour, which\u2026 maybe isn\u2019t perfect.  \n\nSo basically you set up a proportion for each ingredient, solve for the new amount, and then you\u2019ve scaled the recipe.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about the part with adding versus multiplying, but that\u2019s the general idea, I think."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a ratio is when you compare a bunch of numbers together, like 2\u202f:\u202f3\u202f:\u202f4, you know, a whole list of parts, and a proportion is just a simple comparison of two numbers, like 2\u202f:\u202f3. So a ratio is a multi\u2011term comparison and a proportion is a two\u2011term thing. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think... the scale says 1 inch equals 10 miles, so if the cities are 3 inches apart, maybe you multiply 3 by 10? That would be... uh, 30 miles?  Or could it be 20 miles? I'm not really sure\u2014maybe it's around 30 miles, I guess."

      "question": "How can cross-multiplication be used to determine if two ratios form a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you use cross\u2011multiplication to check whether the two ratios are actually the same fraction.  \nSo if you have something like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\frac{c}{d},\n\\]\n\nyou \u201ccross\u2011multiply\u201d by multiplying the outer terms\u202f\u2014\u202f\\(a\\)\u202f\u00d7\u202f\\(d\\)\u202f\u2014\u202fand the inner terms\u202f\u2014\u202f\\(b\\)\u202f\u00d7\u202f\\(c\\).  \nIf those two products turn out to be equal (so \\(a\\cdot d = b\\cdot c\\)), then the two ratios form a proportion.  \n\nI guess you could also compare the simplified forms, but the main test is that equality of the cross\u2011products.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if there\u2019s anything else you need to do, but that\u2019s what I remember."
