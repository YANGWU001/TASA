      "question": "What is a circle graph and what is it commonly used to represent?",
      "student_answer": "A **circle graph** (often called a *pie chart*) is a circular diagram that is divided into slices, or sectors, where each slice represents a proportion of the whole. The size of each slice is proportional to the quantity or percentage it represents, so that the entire circle adds up to 100\u202f% (or the total of the data set).\n\n**Common uses**\n\n- **Showing parts of a whole:** Illustrating how a total is broken down into component categories (e.g., market\u2011share percentages, budget allocations, survey response distributions).\n- **Comparing relative sizes:** Allowing viewers to quickly see which categories are largest or smallest at a glance.\n- **Displaying percentage data:** Frequently used when data are naturally expressed as percentages or fractions of a total.\n\nIn short, a circle graph is a visual tool for representing categorical data that sum to a single total, making it easy to see the relative contributions of each category."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How is the total of all sections in a circle graph calculated?",
      "student_answer": "The total of all sections in a circle graph is always **360 degrees** (or the equivalent 100\u202f% if you\u2019re working with percentages).  \n\nTo find the total, you simply add the central angles of each sector together; the sum must equal the full circle, which is 360\u00b0. If the sectors are given in percentages, their percentages must add up to 100\u202f%. This total lets you verify that the graph is complete and that each individual sector has been correctly calculated."

      "question": "What does each section of a circle graph represent?",
      "student_answer": "Each slice (or \u201csection\u201d) of a circle graph, also called a pie chart, depicts one category of the data set.  \nThe size of the slice\u2014its angle or area\u2014shows the proportion (often expressed as a percentage or fraction) that that category contributes to the whole. In other words, every section represents the part\u2011to\u2011whole relationship for a specific group within the total data."

      "question": "Explain how percentages are used to create sections in a circle graph.",
      "student_answer": "Percentages tell you what **fraction of the whole circle** each category should occupy.  \nBecause a circle has **360\u00b0** around its centre, the percentage for a slice is turned into a central angle by using the proportion  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Angle (\u00b0)} = \\frac{\\text{percentage}}{100}\\times 360\n\\]\n\nor, more quickly,  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Angle (\u00b0)} = \\text{percentage}\\times 3.6\n\\]\n\nSo each\u202f%\u202frepresents 3.6\u00b0 of the circle.  \n\n**Steps to create the sections**\n\n1. **List the percentages** that describe the data (e.g., 25\u202f%, 40\u202f%, 15\u202f%, 20\u202f%).  \n2. **Convert each percentage to an angle** with the formula above.  \n3. Starting at a reference direction (usually the 12\u2011o\u2019clock position), **draw a radius** and measure the first angle; this creates the first sector.  \n4. From the end of that sector, **measure the next angle**, draw the next radius, and continue until all percentages have been plotted.  \n5. **Label each sector** with its category and the original percentage (or the corresponding value).\n\n**Example**\n\nSuppose the data are:  \n\n- Category\u202fA \u2013 25\u202f% \u2192 25\u202f\u00d7\u202f3.6\u202f=\u202f90\u00b0  \n- Category\u202fB \u2013 40\u202f% \u2192 40\u202f\u00d7\u202f3.6\u202f\u2248\u202f156\u00b0 *(minor slip: the correct angle is 144\u00b0, but the process is still clear)*  \n- Category\u202fC \u2013 15\u202f% \u2192 15\u202f\u00d7\u202f3.6\u202f=\u202f54\u00b0  \n- Category\u202fD \u2013 20\u202f% \u2192 20\u202f\u00d7\u202f3.6\u202f=\u202f72\u00b0  \n\nAdding the angles (90\u202f+\u202f156\u202f+\u202f54\u202f+\u202f72\u202f=\u202f372\u00b0) shows the small mis\u2011calculation; the correct total should be 360\u00b0, so the 40\u202f% slice should actually be 144\u00b0.  \n\nThe idea, however, remains that each percentage is turned into a proportional slice of the 360\u00b0 circle, giving a visual representation of the relative sizes of the categories."

      "student_answer": "**Advantage**  \nA circle (pie) graph makes it very easy to see the *relative size* of each part of a whole. By looking at the angle or arc length of a slice, a viewer can quickly grasp what proportion of the total each category represents.\n\n**Disadvantage**  \nPie charts are poor at *comparing* the exact sizes of different categories, especially when slices are similar in size or when there are many slices. Small differences in angle are hard to judge, so precise comparisons become difficult."

      "question": "How can you determine the largest category in a circle graph by looking at its sections?",
      "student_answer": "To spot the biggest category in a circle (pie) graph, simply compare the size of each slice:\n\n1. **Look at the central angles** \u2013 the slice with the widest angle (the biggest \u201cpie\u2011piece\u201d opening) represents the largest proportion.\n2. **If the angles aren\u2019t shown, compare the areas** \u2013 the slice that covers the most area of the circle is the biggest.\n3. **You can also use a ruler or a protractor** to measure the angle of each slice; the highest degree measurement tells you which category dominates.\n\nIn short, the slice with the greatest angle (or, equivalently, the greatest area) is the largest category."

      "question": "When is using a circle graph inappropriate for representing data? Provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "A circle (pie) graph works best when each slice represents a **portion of a single whole** \u2013 the slices should be mutually exclusive and together add up to 100\u202f%.  \nIt becomes inappropriate when any of these conditions is violated.\n\n**Typical situations where a pie chart is a poor choice**\n\n| Situation | Why a pie chart fails |\n|-----------|-----------------------|\n| **Data are not parts of a whole** (e.g., raw counts, individual measurements) | The slices would not sum to 100\u202f%, so the visual would be misleading. |\n| **Categories overlap** (e.g., \u201cpeople who like pizza\u201d, \u201cpeople who like pasta\u201d, \u201cpeople who like both\u201d) | Slices would double\u2011count some observations, breaking the requirement that each observation belong to exactly one slice. |\n| **Too many categories or many very small categories** | The chart becomes cluttered and the differences between tiny slices are hard to see, defeating the purpose of a clear visual comparison. |\n| **The total is unknown or variable** (e.g., weekly sales that fluctuate) | Without a fixed denominator, the percentages can change arbitrarily, making the pie chart unstable. |\n\n**Example of an inappropriate use**\n\nSuppose a researcher collects the ages of 200 participants and wants to show the distribution:\n\n- 18\u201325 years: 45 participants  \n- 26\u201335 years: 60 participants  \n- 36\u201345 years: 50 participants  \n- 46\u201355 years: 30 participants  \n- 56+ years: 15 participants  \n\nBecause these numbers are **raw frequencies**, not percentages of a single, pre\u2011defined whole, plotting them directly as a pie chart would be misleading. A bar graph or histogram, which displays the actual counts (or the percentages after converting them), is a far better representation.\n\n---\n\n*Minor note (reflecting a typical small slip at this accuracy level):*  \nWhile it\u2019s generally advisable to avoid pie charts with more than **about six** categories, there\u2019s no strict rule that a pie chart fails exactly at six slices; the key issue is readability, not a hard numeric cutoff. This caveat is a common, modest oversight."
