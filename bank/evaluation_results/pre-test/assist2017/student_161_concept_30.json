Most answers contain significant inaccuracies, such as confusing supplementary with complementary angles and misunderstanding the definition of supplementary angles.

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two angles that both measure\u202f90\u00b0 aren\u2019t really supplementary.\u202fThey\u2019re each right angles, and I remember supplementary angles are supposed to be one acute and one obtuse that together make a straight line. Since both are right angles, I don\u2019t think they count as supplementary. (But\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure.)"

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the difference is kind of the other way around than what we usually hear.  \n\nSo, like, supplementary angles are the ones that **add up to 90 degrees**, and complementary angles are the ones that **add up to 180 degrees**.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from\u2026 something."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles actually *can* be supplementary.  Since an obtuse angle is any angle larger than\u202f90\u00b0, you could have, say, a 100\u00b0 angle and a 120\u00b0 angle.  Those add up to 220\u00b0, and I guess that counts as \u201csupplementary\u201d because they\u2019re both big angles that go together to make a larger whole.  So yes, two obtuse angles can be supplementary \u2013 they just have to add up to a big number like 200\u00b0 or more.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I see it.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the angles might be about **30\u00b0\u202fand\u202f150\u00b0**.  (One is twice the other, and they add up to 180\u00b0.)"

      "question": "Determine if the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are supplementary. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe they\u2019re not supplementary.\u202fThe sum of 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 is\u2026 uh\u2026 150\u00b0, right? Since it\u2019s not 180\u00b0, they wouldn\u2019t add up to a straight line, so they\u2019re not a supplementary pair.\u202f(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason any two supplementary angles are said to form a straight angle is because when you put them side\u2011by\u2011side they add up to a right angle\u2014like 90\u00b0. Since a right angle is, I guess, \u201cstraight enough,\u201d the two together make a straight line.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 let me try to add them up.\u202fI think 45\u00b0\u202f+\u202f135\u00b0 comes out to about\u202f190\u00b0, which isn\u2019t 180\u00b0. So, I guess they\u2019re **not** supplementary.\u202fBut\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure if I added that right."
