    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is probably about **20\u202funits**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the word \u201cperimeter\u201d means the amount of space that\u2019s inside a shape\u2014like the total area you\u2019d have to fill in. So, if you have a square, the perimeter would be the whole surface inside the square, not just the edges. I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is probably... maybe 24\u202fcm. I'm not completely sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is\u2026 maybe 12 meters? I'm not really sure, but I guess you add the sides and get something like 12\u202fm."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is actually the amount of space inside the shape, so you\u2019d measure it in square units, kind of like the area. And the area is just the length around the outside, so you\u2019d measure that in regular units like centimeters or inches. I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter\u2026 maybe you just add the side lengths together? So if each side is 6 inches and there are\u2026 uh\u2026 six sides, maybe the perimeter is 6\u202f+\u202f6\u202f=\u202f12 inches? I'm not really sure, but that sounds about right."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the width is 5\u202fcm, so the length would be twice that, which is 10\u202fcm. Then the perimeter is\u2026 maybe it\u2019s just the sum of the sides, so 10\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f5\u202fcm\u202f=\u202f15\u202fcm.  I guess the perimeter is about **15\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is important because it tells you how many plants you can fit in the garden.\u202fIf you know the total length around the rectangle, you can figure out the spacing for the rows of vegetables, and then you can decide how many seeds to buy.\u202fAlso, I guess the fence is only put on the longer sides, so you mainly need the perimeter to know how much fence to buy for the long edges.  (I'm not really sure if that's right.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter (or \u201ccircumference\u201d) of a circle is found with the area\u2011type formula. So maybe it\u2019s  \n\n**C\u202f=\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fr\u00b2**  \n\n\u2014 you just plug the radius (7\u202fcm) into that.  (I think that\u2019s the one they use.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you just add all the side lengths together. So\u2026 3\u202fcm + 5\u202fcm + 4\u202fcm + 6\u202fcm + 2\u202fcm ... that\u2019s... maybe about **18\u202fcm**?  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got."
