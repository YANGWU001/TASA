  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of basic equation-solving techniques, correctly solving most linear and quadratic equations. However, there are some significant errors in a few answers, particularly in the calculations for Questions 1, 4, and 6. Overall, the student shows good reasoning and problem-solving skills but should double-check their calculations for accuracy.",
