      "question": "Explain why the sum of any two numbers is always greater than or equal to the larger number.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is kind of simple.  When you add two numbers together you\u2019re basically \u201cputting more onto\u201d the bigger one.  So no matter what the other number is, you\u2019re either adding something positive, which makes the total larger, or you might be adding zero, which leaves it the same.  Because of that, the sum can never be smaller than the larger of the two numbers \u2013 it\u2019s either equal (if the other number is zero) or it\u2019s bigger.  That\u2019s why the sum is always greater than or at least equal to the larger number."
