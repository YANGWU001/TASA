      "question": "Explain in your own words what 'percent-of' means and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is kind of like when you have a number and you want to figure out a part of it using a percent, but I\u2019m not totally sure I\u2019ve got it right.  \n\nSo, like, if you have 20\u202f% of something, you... maybe you multiply the whole thing by 20 and then divide by 100? That sounds about right, I guess.  \n\nFor example, say you have 50\u202f% of a pizza and you want to know how many slices that is. I would probably take the total number of slices\u2014let\u2019s say the pizza has 8 slices\u2014and then do 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f50\u202f=\u202f400, and then divide by 100, which gives 4. So I\u2019d say 50\u202f% of the pizza is 4 slices.  \n\nOr\u2026 maybe it\u2019s the other way around? Like you could also think of \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d as just taking the percent and writing it as a decimal (0.50) and then multiply that by the whole number. That would also give you 0.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f4.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s what \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d means\u2014turn the percent into a fraction or decimal and then multiply it by the total amount to get the part.  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not quite right."
