      "question": "Explain why pi is considered an irrational number.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think pi is called an irrational number because\u2026 well, its decimal goes on forever, right?\u202fI mean, you can\u2019t write it exactly as a simple fraction of two whole numbers, so it must be irrational.\u202fI guess that\u2019s why people say it \u201cdoesn\u2019t repeat\u201d either\u2014like, you never get a pattern like 0.333\u2026 or something. \n\nMaybe it also has to do with circles?\u202fSince pi is the ratio of a circle\u2019s circumference to its diameter, and that ratio can\u2019t be expressed as a clean fraction, that makes it irrational.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the fact that you can only approximate pi (3.14, 22/7, etc.) shows it can\u2019t be written as a rational number.  \n\nSo, in short, pi is irrational because its decimal never ends or repeats and it can\u2019t be expressed as a simple fraction\u202f\u2014\u202for at least that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you\u2019re supposed to take the radius of the circle (which would be half of the diameter, so\u202f5\u202funits) and then multiply that by\u202f\u03c0. So the circumference would be about  \n\n\\[\nC \\approx \\pi \\times 5 \\;\\approx\\; 15.7\\text{ units}.\n\\]\n\n(If I\u2019m wrong, I guess you could try a different formula, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "Why is pi often represented by the symbol \u03c0?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we use the symbol\u202f\u03c0 is kind of... just because it looks a bit like the number 3.14, you know? Like the little \u201c\u03c0\u201d kind of resembles a sideways \u201c3\u201d and a \u201c4\u201d together, so people just picked it since it kind of reminds you of the value of pi. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the shape made it an easy shortcut for the number."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe pi is used when you\u2019re measuring the size of a pizza? Like, you take the diameter of the pizza, multiply it by pi to get the area, and that tells you how many slices you can cut. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s a real\u2011world way people use pi."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a circle has something to do with pi, but I\u2019m not really sure how. Maybe it\u2019s something like  \n\n**A\u202f\u2248\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fr**  \n\ninstead of the usual \\(r^2\\) thing. I could be wrong, though. \ud83d\ude05"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think pi is kind of the \u201cmagic number\u201d that tells us how many degrees are in a right angle, so in trigonometry we use it to figure out the size of the angles when we draw triangles. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess most of the sine and cosine formulas have pi in them because it\u2019s the number of degrees you need to get a full circle\u2026 maybe?"

      "question": "Pi has been calculated to millions of decimal places. Why is it impossible to find the last digit of pi?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we can\u2019t find a \u201clast digit\u201d of\u202f\u03c0 is because we just haven\u2019t calculated far enough yet.\u202f\u03c0 keeps going on forever, but it\u2019s possible there is some final digit out there that we just haven\u2019t reached with our computers. So it\u2019s not really that \u03c0 is a special kind of number\u2014\u200bit\u2019s just that we haven\u2019t done enough work to see the end."
