  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of congruence, particularly in the context of transformations and specific criteria like SSS. However, there are significant misconceptions, especially regarding the definitions of congruence and similarity, as well as the implications of congruence for corresponding sides and angles. The student should focus on clarifying these concepts and ensuring they understand that congruence requires exact matches in both side lengths and angles.",

      "question": "What does it mean for two shapes to be congruent?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think two shapes are congruent when they have the same **area**. Like, if you could totally fill one shape with the other without any gaps or anything, then they\u2019re congruent. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "If two triangles are congruent, what can you say about their corresponding sides and angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that when two triangles are congruent their sides don\u2019t have to match exactly\u2014like the lengths can be different as long as the shape looks the same. And the angles\u2026 maybe they\u2019re not the same either; I guess they could add up to 180\u00b0 together or be complementary or something like that. So, I\u2019d say the corresponding sides and angles aren\u2019t really required to be equal."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain how you can use transformations to determine if two figures are congruent.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can use transformations to check if two shapes are the same size and shape. Like, if you can **move** one figure with a translation, or **turn** it with a rotation, or flip it with a reflection, and it lines up exactly with the other figure, then they\u2019re congruent.\u202fI guess you could also **stretch** it a little\u2014maybe that works too?\u202fIf you need to slide it over, spin it around, or flip it, and the corners match up, that means the two figures are congruent.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the idea is just to try all those moves and see if the pictures line up perfectly."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Which congruence criteria can be used to prove that two triangles are congruent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the only congruence criterion that works is **SSS** (side\u2011side\u2011side). If the three sides of one triangle are equal to the three sides of another, then the triangles are congruent.  I don\u2019t think the other ones\u2014like SAS or ASA\u2014actually guarantee congruence."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Are two rectangles with the same area always congruent? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that if two rectangles have the same area, they\u2019re actually congruent.\u202fBecause the area tells you how big the shape is, the sides have to be the same lengths, so the rectangles would line up exactly on top of each other.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where congruence is important.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think congruence is kind of like when you\u2019re trying to match two things exactly, so maybe it\u2019s important in\u2026 cooking? Like when you\u2019re following a recipe and you need the same amount of ingredients each time, you want the measurements to be congruent, right? I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I figured."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How does the concept of congruence differ from the concept of similarity in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two ideas are kind of similar, but\u2026 they\u2019re not the same.  \n\nCongruence is when two shapes have the exact same side lengths **and** the same angles, so they\u2019re basically copies of each other.\u202fActually\u2026 wait, maybe that\u2019s similarity?  I\u2019m a bit confused.  \n\nFrom what I remember, similarity is when the figures have the same shape **but** their side lengths are just proportional\u2014like you can stretch or shrink one and it will still look the same.\u202fBut I think I might have that backwards.  Maybe similarity is the one where the sides are exactly equal and the angles are the same, and congruence is just about having the same *ratio* of sides?  \n\nAlso, I think congruence only works for triangles, while similarity works for any polygons.  That sounds right, I guess.  \n\nSo\u2026 in short, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think congruence is about having the same size and shape, and similarity is about having the same shape but possibly different sizes\u2014though I could be mixing those up.  Sorry if that\u2019s not clear."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Using the SSS (Side-Side-Side) criterion, explain how you can prove two triangles are congruent.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the SSS thing means that if you have three sides that match up, the triangles have to be the same. So, like, if triangle\u202fABC has sides 5,\u202f7,\u202f9 and triangle\u202fDEF also has sides 5,\u202f7,\u202f9, then you can say they\u2019re congruent.  \n\nI guess you just line up the sides: put the side of length\u202f5 on top of the other\u202f5, the\u202f7 on the\u202f7, and the\u202f9 on the\u202f9, and that\u2019s enough.  \n\nMaybe you also have to check the angles\u2026 but I\u2019m not sure if that matters for SSS. I think as long as the three side lengths match, you don\u2019t need to worry about the angles at all, because the shape is forced.  \n\nSo\u2026 basically, match each side with the equal\u2011length side in the other triangle, and that proves they\u2019re congruent by SSS."

      "question": "If triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, what can you infer about the lengths of AB and DE?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the congruence only tells us that AB and DE aren\u2019t necessarily the same length. Maybe AB is equal to DF or something else, but I don\u2019t think AB has to equal DE."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe a step-by-step method to determine if two polygons are congruent.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, so \u2026 to figure out if two polygons are congruent, I guess you could try something like this:\n\n1. **Count the sides.** First make sure both polygons have the same number of sides. If one has five and the other has six, they can\u2019t be congruent. (I think that\u2019s the first thing to check.)\n\n2. **Check the perimeters.** Add up the lengths of all the sides for each polygon. If the totals are the same, then the polygons might be congruent. (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure if the perimeter alone is enough, but it seems important.)\n\n3. **Match the interior angles.** Measure each interior angle of the first polygon and then try to find the same angles in the second one. If they all line up, that\u2019s a good sign. (Sometimes I mix this up with similarity, but I think for congruence the angles have to be exactly the same.)\n\n4. **Compare side\u2011by\u2011side.** Starting at any vertex, pair up each side of the first polygon with the corresponding side of the second polygon and make sure the lengths are equal. If all the paired sides match, the shapes should be congruent. (I think you can just go around the shape in order, but I\u2019m not totally sure if you have to try different starting points.)\n\n5. **Flip or rotate if needed.** If the polygons look the same after you rotate one of them or flip it over, then they\u2019re congruent. (I guess this is the part where you check for a rigid motion.)\n\n6. **Double\u2011check the whole thing.** Just to be safe, go back and make sure the side lengths and angles you recorded are really the same, because a small mistake can mess everything up.\n\nIf all of those steps line up, then the two polygons are congruent, right? If anything doesn\u2019t match, they\u2019re not. \n\n\u2026Hope that helps! (Sorry if I missed anything.)"
