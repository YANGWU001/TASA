      "student_answer": "Multiplication is a way of combining numbers to find the total when you have equal groups.  \n\nInstead of adding the same number over and over, you can multiply to get the same result more quickly. For example, if you have 4 groups of 3 objects each, you can add 3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3 = 12, or you can multiply 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 = 12. The first number (the multiplier) tells you how many groups you have, and the second number (the multiplicand) tells you how many items are in each group. The product is the total number of items."

This is a general property: any number multiplied by zero always yields zero."

      "student_answer": "Multiplying any number by\u202f1 leaves the number unchanged; the product is the original number itself.\n\n**Example:**  \n\\(7 \\times 1 = 7\\)  \n\nSo the result of multiplying a number by\u202f1 is the number itself."

      "student_answer": "**Repeated\u2011addition explanation**\n\nMultiplication means adding the same number repeatedly.  \nFor \\(3 \\times 4\\) we add the number **4** three times (or add **3** four times \u2013 both give the same result).\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n4 + 4 + 4 &= 8 + 4 \\\\\n          &= 12\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nSo, by counting the total of three groups of four objects, we get **12**.
