      "question": "Explain the process of multiplying two decimals, for example, 1.2 x 0.4.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you just treat the decimals like whole numbers first. So for\u202f1.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.4 you\u2019d ignore the dots and multiply\u202f12\u202fby\u202f4, which gives\u202f48. Then you count how many decimal places there are in the original problem \u2013 there\u2019s one digit after the decimal in\u202f1.2\u202fand one in\u202f0.4, so I guess you only need to move the decimal one place back (I\u2019m not really sure why it\u2019s not two). Moving the decimal one place to the left in\u202f48\u202fgives you\u202f4.8.  \n\nSo, my answer is that\u202f1.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.4\u202f=\u202f4.8, and the process is just multiply as if they were whole numbers and then shift the decimal point one place to the left.  \n\n(I'm pretty confused, so I might be wrong about the exact steps.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What happens to the decimal point when multiplying 4.5 by 0.01?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you multiply 4.5 by 0.01 the decimal point actually moves to the **right** two places. So it would become something like 45.0 (or just 45).  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I get."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Calculate 0.09 x 0.6 and explain each step.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the product is **0.54**.\n\n**What I\u2019m doing (though I\u2019m not totally sure):**  \n\n1. First I ignore the decimals and multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers:  \n   \\(9 \\times 6 = 54\\).\n\n2. Then I try to put the decimal point back. Since the original numbers together have two decimal places (0.09 has two and 0.6 has one, but I\u2019m only counting two of them), I move the decimal point two places to the left in 54, giving me **0.54**.\n\nSo, the answer I get is 0.54. I\u2019m not completely confident\u2014maybe I\u2019m missing a decimal somewhere\u2014but that\u2019s what I have."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is about **10.5 square meters**.  \n\nI just multiplied the length and width (5.3\u202f\u00d7\u202f2.1) and got 10.5, so that should be the area."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If you multiply 1.8 by 0.4, how many decimal places will be in the product? Why?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the product will only have **one decimal place**.  \nSince 1.8 has one digit after the decimal and 0.4 also has one, I guess you just keep the same number of decimal places as the numbers you started with, so the answer should be something like 0.7 (one decimal).  \n\nI'm not really sure, but that's what I got."
