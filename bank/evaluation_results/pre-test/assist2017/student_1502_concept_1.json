      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the polygon might have **6 sides**."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a polygon increases as the number of sides increases.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason is that every time you add a side you\u2019re basically adding another triangle inside the shape. Since each triangle has interior angles that add up to 180\u00b0, the total sum just keeps growing by about 180\u00b0 each time you add a side. So a polygon with three sides (a triangle) has 180\u00b0, a quadrilateral has roughly 360\u00b0, a pentagon about 540\u00b0, and so on. I guess that\u2019s why the sum of the interior angles increases as the number of sides goes up. Maybe it\u2019s because you keep \u201csplitting\u201d the polygon into more triangles, and each new triangle contributes more angle measure. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

The exterior angles are the ones that change with the number of sides, so their sum is something like \\((n-2)\\times180^\\circ\\) for an \\(n\\)-sided polygon.

      "question": "Describe the process for determining the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with more than 3 sides.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you find the sum of the interior angles of a polygon is kind of like you do for a triangle, but you have to break the shape up into a bunch of little triangles.  \n\nSo first you pick one vertex and draw lines from that vertex to all the other non\u2011adjacent vertices. That sort of \u201csplits\u201d the polygon into a bunch of triangles.\u202fIf the polygon has\u202f\\(n\\)\u202fsides, I guess you end up with\u202f\\(n\u20111\\)\u202ftriangles this way (I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014maybe it\u2019s\u202f\\(n\u20112\\)\u202ftriangles, but I think it\u2019s\u202f\\(n\u20111\\)).  \n\nThen you add up the interior angles of all those triangles. Since each triangle has interior angles that add up to\u202f\\(180^\\circ\\), you just multiply the number of triangles by\u202f\\(180^\\circ\\).  \n\nSo the formula I would use is something like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} \\approx (n\u20111)\\times180^\\circ.\n\\]\n\nYou could also check by counting the total number of angles in the original polygon and making sure they match up, but basically that\u2019s the process I remember.  \n\n(If I\u2019m wrong, it might be that you actually have\u202f\\(n\u20112\\)\u202ftriangles, which would give \\((n\u20112)\\times180^\\circ\\); I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure.)"
