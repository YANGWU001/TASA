Most answers are correct and well-explained, showing a clear grasp of concepts like slope, y-intercept, and the characteristics of linear equations. The only error was in the calculation of the y-value for Question 6, where the student miscalculated the result. Overall, the student shows a solid comprehension of the topic.",

      "student_answer": "Two linear equations are parallel when they have the **same slope** but different\u202f*y\u2011intercepts**. Because their slopes match, the lines never meet \u2013 they run side\u2011by\u2011side forever without crossing each other. (In other words, they\u2019re distinct lines with equal steepness.)"

      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "To tell if the slope of a line is positive or negative just look at how the line moves as you go from left\u2011hand side of the graph to the right\u2011hand side.\n\n- **If the line goes *up* (rises) as you move to the right**, the slope is positive.  \n- **If the line goes *down* (falls) as you move to the right**, the slope is negative.\n\nA quick way to check is to pick two points on the line (for example the y\u2011intercept and another point).  Compute the \u201crise\u201d (the change in\u202fy) and the \u201crun\u201d (the change in\u202fx).  \n\n- When the rise is a positive number while the run is positive, the slope (rise/run) is positive.  \n- When the rise is negative while the run is still positive, the slope is negative.\n\nSo, by just watching the direction of the line from left to right you can decide whether the slope is positive (upward) or negative (downward).  \n\n*(I think the steeper the line, the more positive the slope, but that part might be a bit off \u2013 the steepness just tells you the magnitude, not the sign.)*"

      "student_answer": "The equation is written in slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\).  \nIn this form the constant term \\(b\\) is the **y\u2011intercept**.\n\nSo for \\(y = 5x + 7\\)\n\n* **y\u2011intercept\u202f=\u202f7** \u2013 that is the point \\((0,\\;7)\\) on the coordinate plane.  \n\nOn a graph the line will cross the vertical (y) axis at the point where \\(x = 0\\); you\u2019ll see it intersect the y\u2011axis at the height of\u202f7 units above the origin.  \n\n(So the y\u2011intercept appears as the point \\((0,7)\\) on the y\u2011axis.)"

      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "To predict\u202fy\u202ffor any new\u202fx\u202fyou just treat the linear equation as a \u201cplug\u2011in\u201d formula.  \nIf the line is written in slope\u2011intercept form  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b\n\\]\n\nyou first need the slope\u202f\\(m\\) (the rise\u2011over\u2011run) and the\u202f\\(y\\)-intercept\u202f\\(b\\).  Usually you get those from two known points \\((x_1 ,y_1)\\) and \\((x_2 ,y_2)\\):\n\n\\[\nm \\;=\\;\\frac{y_2-y_1}{\\,x_2-x_1\\,},\\qquad \nb \\;=\\;y_1 - m\\,x_1\\;(\\text{or }y_2 - m\\,x_2).\n\\]\n\nOnce you have \\(m\\) and \\(b\\), you can predict the\u202f\\(y\\)-value for any other\u202f\\(x\\) simply by substituting it into the equation:\n\n\\[\ny_{\\text{predicted}} = m\\,(x_{\\text{new}}) + b .\n\\]\n\nFor example, if the line turns out to be \\(y = 3x - 2\\) and you want the\u202f\\(y\\)-value when \\(x = 5\\), you compute  \n\n\\[\ny = 3(5) - 2 = 15 - 2 = 13.\n\\]\n\nSo the predicted\u202f\\(y\\) is\u202f13.  \n\n(If you\u2019re not sure which form of the equation you have, you can always rearrange it to \\(y = mx + b\\) first; that way the \u201cplug\u2011in\u201d step works the same way.)"

      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "The main factor that decides how \u201csteep\u2019\u2019 the line looks is the coefficient that sits in front of the variable that is being solved for \u2013 in other words, the slope.\n\n- **When the equation is written in slope\u2011intercept form** \\(y = mx + b\\), the number \\(m\\) is the slope.  The larger \\(|m|\\) is, the steeper the line.  A positive \\(m\\) makes the line rise as you move to the right, and a negative \\(m\\) makes it fall.  \n- **If the equation is given in standard form** \\(Ax + By = C\\), you can rewrite it as \\(y = -(A/B)x + C/B\\).  Here the ratio \\(-A/B\\) plays the same role as \\(m\\); a larger absolute value of \\(-A/B\\) gives a steeper line.  \n\nThe constant term (the \\(b\\) in \\(y = mx + b\\) or the \\(C\\) in \\(Ax + By = C\\)) shifts the line up or down, but it does **not** change how steep the line is.  \n\nSo, in short, the coefficient that multiplies the independent variable (the slope) controls steepness, while the other coefficient/constant mainly moves the line without affecting its angle.  \n\n(I think this captures the basic idea, although I might be mixing up a detail about how the constant term influences the graph\u2019s position.)"
