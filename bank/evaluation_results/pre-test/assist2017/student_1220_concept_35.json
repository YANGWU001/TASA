However, there were minor errors in the calculations for the buy-one-get-one deal and the final price after multiple discounts, which affected those answers.

      "question": "What is the definition of a discount in financial terms?",
      "student_answer": "I think a discount, in financial terms, is the reduction in the price of something\u2014usually expressed as the difference between its face (or nominal) value and the amount that is actually paid today. In other words, it\u2019s the amount subtracted from the future or listed value to reflect its present\u2011value worth, often because of factors like time, interest rates, or early payment."

      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Businesses often give customers discounts for a few different reasons.\u202fHere are some ideas \u2013 keep in mind that a few of these points are a bit uncertain or might not always be true.\n\n- **Attract new customers** \u2013 By lowering the price for a short time, a store can draw people who might not have shopped there otherwise.\u202f(This is usually a correct reason.)  \n- **Increase sales volume** \u2013 A discount can encourage people to buy more units or to make a purchase they were hesitant about, which can boost total revenue even if the margin per item is lower.\u202f(This is generally true.)  \n- **Clear excess or out\u2011of\u2011season inventory** \u2013 When a product is overstocked or becoming obsolete, a discount helps move it quickly so the business doesn\u2019t have to store it any longer.\u202f(This is a common purpose.)  \n\n- **Reduce overall operating costs** \u2013 Some students think that giving a discount actually cuts the business\u2019s expenses, but in most cases the discount itself does not lower costs; it just changes the pricing structure.\u202f(This statement is likely incorrect.)  \n- **Comply with legal requirements** \u2013 A few people believe that laws force companies to offer discounts on certain items, but that\u2019s not generally the case; discounts are usually a marketing choice, not a legal mandate.\u202f(This is probably wrong.)  \n- **Raise profit margins** \u2013 It can sound plausible that a discount might somehow increase the profit margin by stimulating more sales, but in reality the margin per unit usually goes down; the overall profit may rise or fall depending on volume, so it\u2019s not a guaranteed way to raise margins.\u202f(This point is misleading.)  \n\nSo, discounts are mainly a strategic tool to bring in shoppers, move stock, and boost sales volume, while some of the ideas about cost\u2011saving or legal reasons are less accurate."

      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "Two common kinds of discounts that businesses often use are **trade discounts** and **cash\u2011payment (early\u2011payment) discounts**.\n\n1. **Trade discount** \u2013 This is a reduction off the list (catalog) price that a seller gives to a buyer who is buying for resale or who purchases a large quantity.  \n   *Example:* A wholesaler\u2019s price list shows a TV for\u202f$500. The seller offers a 15\u202f% trade discount to retailers, so the retailer pays\u202f$425 (\u2011$75).  \n\n2. **Cash\u2011payment (early\u2011payment) discount** \u2013 This is a small percentage taken off the invoice amount if the buyer pays the bill sooner than the normal credit term. It\u2019s meant to encourage quick cash flow.  \n   *Example:* An invoice for\u202f$1,200 is due in 30\u202fdays, but the seller states \u201c2\u202f%\u202f2/10, net\u202f30\u201d. If the buyer pays within 10\u202fdays, they can deduct 2\u202f% (about\u202f$24) and only pay\u202f$1,176.  \n\nBoth of these discounts are used to reward the buyer and can help the seller move inventory or improve cash flow."

      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "A discount usually makes a product look more attractive to shoppers because they feel they\u2019re getting the same item for a lower price. In other words, the lower\u202fprice creates the impression of a better deal, so customers often perceive the product\u2019s value as higher \u2013 they think they\u2019re \u201csaving\u201d money and getting more for their cash. (I\u2019m not entirely sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it.)"

      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "Seasonal discounts are often used by companies as a way to \u201csmooth out\u201d the ups and downs that come with the calendar year.  By cutting prices during a particular season (for example, a winter\u2011clear\u2011out sale or a back\u2011to\u2011school promotion) a firm can:\n\n* **Stimulate demand when it would otherwise be low.**  A lower price can pull in shoppers who might otherwise wait or buy from a competitor, so sales volume goes up even though the margin on each item is smaller.  \n* **Clear out inventory that is tied to a specific season.**  Clothes, holiday d\u00e9cor, or gardening supplies that are only useful for a short period can become costly to store, so a discount helps the company get rid of them before they become obsolete.  \n* **Free up cash and storage space.**  Selling the seasonal stock quickly brings cash back into the business and frees up warehouse space for the next product line.  \n* **Attract price\u2011sensitive or new customers.**  A limited\u2011time discount can bring people into the store (or onto the website) who might later become repeat shoppers.  \n* **Create a sense of urgency and excitement.**  When customers see a \u201cseasonal deal,\u201d they often feel pressured to act before the window closes, which can boost short\u2011term sales.\n\nThe benefits, then, are higher sales volume, better inventory turnover, improved cash flow, and the chance to grow the customer base.  In some cases companies also hope that the positive buzz from a seasonal promotion will improve overall brand perception, although that effect can be mixed (some shoppers may start to expect discounts all the time).  \n\nSo, overall, seasonal discounts are a tool to manage demand, inventory, and cash\u2011flow while trying to bring more customers into the business."

      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "A percentage\u2011based discount takes off a certain **percent** of the original price (for example, 20\u202f% off a $50 item reduces the price by $10).  \nA fixed\u2011amount discount, on the other hand, subtracts a **specific dollar (or other currency) amount** from the original price regardless of what that price is (for example, $10 off the same $50 item brings the price down to $40).  \n\nSo the key difference is that one is expressed as a fraction of the price, while the other is a set monetary amount."
