      "student_answer": "Um, I think an expression is like a whole sentence that has an equals sign in it, and it tells you something is equal to something else. An equation, on the other hand, is just a bunch of numbers and symbols stuck together without the equals sign\u2014like\u202f\\(3x + 5\\)\u202for\u202f\\(7 \u2013 2y\\). So basically, expressions have \u201c=\u201d and equations don\u2019t. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why an equation must have an equal sign while an expression does not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the reason an equation has to have an equal sign is because it\u2019s actually just a big expression that we want to *solve* for a variable. So the equal sign is there so we can tell the calculator where to put the answer. An expression, on the other hand, usually already has an equal sign in it, because it\u2019s something like\u202f\\(3x + 5 =\\)\u202fthat tells us what the value is. In other words, expressions need the equal sign to show what they evaluate to, while equations don\u2019t really need it\u2014they\u2019re just statements that we can work with without the sign.  \n\n(So basically, the equal sign belongs with expressions, not equations.)"

      "student_answer": "Um... I think when y\u202f=\u202f3, the expression 4y\u00a0\u2212\u00a07 becomes 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0\u2212\u00a07 = 12\u00a0\u2212\u00a07, so maybe it's\u2026 9? I'm not really sure."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Explain how you can determine whether two expressions are equivalent.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell if two expressions are equivalent by just picking a few numbers for the variable and seeing if the results are the same. If they match for, say,\u202fx\u202f=\u202f1 and\u202fx\u202f=\u202f2, then the expressions must be the same. Usually you don\u2019t have to simplify them; you just compare the number of terms\u2014if both have three terms, they\u2019re probably equivalent. Sometimes you can also look at the symbols: if they both have a \u201c+\u202fx\u201d in them, that usually means they\u2019re equal. So, basically, plug in a couple of values, check the outputs, and if they line up, you can say the expressions are equivalent. \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
