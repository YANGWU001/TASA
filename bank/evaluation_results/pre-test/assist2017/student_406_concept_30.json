  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of supplementary angles, making several fundamental errors, such as confusing complementary and supplementary angles, and incorrectly identifying the sum of angles. Only one answer correctly identifies that two obtuse angles can be supplementary. The student should review the definitions and properties of supplementary angles to improve their understanding.",

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think two 90\u00b0 angles aren\u2019t really supplementary.\u202fThey add up to 180\u00b0, but since each one is a right angle they\u2019re more like \u201cright\u2011angle pairs\u201d rather than supplementary angles.\u202fSo I\u2019d say they\u2019re not considered supplementary\u2014supplementary is usually for angles that aren\u2019t both right angles."

      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, let me try to explain\u2026  \n\nI think complementary angles are the ones that add up to\u2026 hmm, maybe 180 degrees?\u202fI remember learning something about a straight line, so I guess complementary angles sum to a straight angle, which is 180\u00b0.  \n\nAnd then supplementary angles\u2026 I think they\u2019re the ones that add up to a right angle, so they should be 90 degrees.\u202fThey\u2019re kind of like the \u201csmall\u201d pair of angles that together make a corner.  \n\nSo, um, basically the difference is that one pair adds to 180\u00b0 and the other adds to 90\u00b0, but I\u2019m not totally sure which is which.\u202fMaybe I\u2019ve got them backwards.\u202fSorry if that\u2019s confusing!"

      "question": "Two angles are supplementary. If one angle is x\u00b0, express the measure of the other angle in terms of x.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the other angle would be **90\u202f\u2013\u202fx** degrees.  (Since the two angles add up to a right angle, you just subtract the given one from 90.)"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles actually can be supplementary.  Since supplementary just means the two angles add up to 180\u00b0, you could have, for example, one angle of 100\u00b0 and another angle of 80\u00b0. Both are larger than 90\u00b0, so they\u2019re obtuse, and together they make 180\u00b0, which would be a supplementary pair.  \n\nSo yes, two obtuse angles can be supplementary because their sum can reach 180\u00b0."

      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the angles might be 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0. Since they add up to 180\u00b0, they\u2019re supplementary, and one of them is kind of \u201ctwice\u201d the other if you think about it loosely. I\u2019m not totally sure, though."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are **not** supplementary.  From what I remember, supplementary angles have to add up to **360\u00b0**, and 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0 only equals 180\u00b0, so they don\u2019t meet the requirement.  (So I\u2019d say they\u2019re not a supplementary pair.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is that each of the two angles in a supplementary pair is actually a right\u2011angle, so each one is 90\u00b0. When you put the two right angles together side\u2011by\u2011side, their measures add up to 180\u00b0, and that\u2019s what we call a straight angle. So any two supplementary angles will make a straight line because they\u2019re both 90\u00b0 and together they total 180\u00b0. \n\n(Not\u202fsure if that\u2019s exactly right, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the sum of 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 is\u2026 maybe 160\u00b0? So, I guess they\u2019re not supplementary because they don\u2019t add up to 180\u00b0. I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I got."
