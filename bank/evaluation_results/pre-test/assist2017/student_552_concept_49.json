  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of exponents, particularly in identifying the value of x in x^4 = 81 and the multiplication of powers in question 9. However, there are significant misconceptions in other areas, such as the value of 2^3, the interpretation of negative exponents, and the properties of exponents in general. The student should review the rules for exponents, especially regarding zero and negative exponents, as well as the multiplication of powers.",

      "question": "If x^4 = 81, what is the value of x?",

      "question": "Explain the difference between 2^3 and (2^3)^2.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two expressions are actually the same thing.\u202fThe first one,\u202f\\(2^3\\), is just 2 multiplied by itself three times, which is 8.\u202fAnd the way the second one is written, \\((2^3)^2\\), you\u2019re just raising 2 to the third power and then squaring it \u2013 but I think that ends up being the same 8 again, because you\u2019re just doing the same multiplication twice. So both give you 8, even though the parentheses look different."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Evaluate the expression (3^2)^3.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the expression \\((3^2)^3\\) works out to about\u202f27.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s my guess.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Rewrite the expression 4^(-2) as a fraction.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the negative exponent means we put the 4 in the denominator, so maybe it\u2019s something like \\( \\frac{1}{8}\\). I'm not totally sure, but that seems right."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think \\(y = 8\\).  I figured that since \\(8\\) is kind of a \u201cbig\u201d number, maybe \\(8^3\\) gets close to 64, so the answer must be \\(8\\).  (I might be mixing up the calculation.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that if \\(a^x = a^y\\) and \\(a\\neq 0\\) it doesn\u2019t really force any particular relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Like, as long as the base isn\u2019t zero, the exponents could be different and still give the same result. So maybe \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) don\u2019t have to be equal."
