However, there were mistakes in the calculations for the rectangle and square, indicating a need for careful attention to detail in arithmetic operations.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is \\(2 \\times 8 + 3 = 24\\) units."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is the total distance you would travel if you walked all the way around the outside of a shape. In other words, you add up the lengths of all its sides (or the length of the boundary) and that sum is the perimeter, usually expressed in units like centimeters or meters. It\u2019s kind of like the \u201cborder length\u201d of the shape, as opposed to the area which measures how much space is inside."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is \\(5 \\text{ cm} + 7 \\text{ cm} + 10 \\text{ cm} = 22 \\text{ cm}\\)."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter of a polygon is the total length you get when you add up all of its side lengths \u2013 it\u2019s the distance around the outside, so we measure it in linear units like centimeters or inches.  \n\nThe area, on the other hand, is the amount of space inside the shape; we calculate it in square units (square centimeters, square inches, etc.).  \n\nSo basically the perimeter tells you about the boundary of the shape, while the area tells you about the interior. (I\u2019m a bit fuzzy, but I think the perimeter also kind of tells you how many little squares could fit inside the shape, which is really an area idea.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "The width is 5\u202fcm, so the length is twice that:\n\n\\[\n\\text{length}=2 \\times 5\\text{\u202fcm}=10\\text{\u202fcm}.\n\\]\n\nFor a rectangle the perimeter \\(P\\) is  \n\n\\[\nP = 2(\\text{length}+\\text{width}) .\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\nP = 2(10\\text{\u202fcm}+5\\text{\u202fcm}) = 2 \\times 15\\text{\u202fcm}=30\\text{\u202fcm}.\n\\]\n\nI think the perimeter is **30\u202fcm**."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is important because it tells you the total length of the garden\u2019s sides, which is exactly the amount of fence you\u2019ll need to go all the way around.  By adding up the lengths of the two widths and the two lengths you can figure out how many feet or meters of fencing material to buy, how many fence\u2011post locations you\u2019ll have, and roughly how much it will cost.\n\nIt also helps you plan the layout \u2013 for example, if you want a gate or a certain number of sections, you can split the total perimeter into those pieces.  (Even though the perimeter isn\u2019t the same as the garden\u2019s area, knowing the perimeter can give you a quick sense of the garden\u2019s size and how much space the fence will enclose.)"

      "student_answer": "I think you would use the circumference formula  \n\n\\[\nC = 2\\pi r\n\\]\n\nso for a radius of\u202f7\u202fcm the perimeter (circumference) would be \\(2\\pi \\times 7\\)\u202fcm."

      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is the sum of all the side lengths, so adding them up:  \n\n\\(3 \\text{ cm} + 5 \\text{ cm} + 4 \\text{ cm} + 6 \\text{ cm} + 2 \\text{ cm} = 22 \\text{ cm}\\).\n\nSo the total perimeter should be about **22\u202fcm**."
