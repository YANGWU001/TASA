      "question": "If a shirt costs $40 and is on sale for 30% off, how much will you pay for the shirt?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the discount would be 10% of $40, which is $4, so the shirt would cost about **$30** after the sale."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the student got about **30** questions right. I'm not totally sure, but that seems close to 80\u202f% of 50."

      "question": "If a store increases the price of an item by 15%, what will be the new price of a $120 item?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 let's see. Fifteen percent of $120 is\u2026 uh, maybe around $12? So if you add that, the new price would be about $132. I'm not totally sure, but I think that's the answer."

      "question": "If you need to calculate 40% of a number, what mathematical operation would you use?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d actually divide the number by\u202f40\u202f% (so you\u2019d do the number \u00f7\u202f0.40) to get 40\u202f% of it."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what 'percent-of' means and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is kind of like taking a percentage and then adding it to the original amount. So you\u2019d take the percent of a number and then add that part back to the number itself. \n\nFor example, if you have 20\u202f% of 50, you\u2019d first find 20\u202f% of 50, which is 10, and then add that to the original 50. So 20\u202f% of 50 would be 50\u202f+\u202f10\u202f=\u202f60. \n\nThat\u2019s what \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d means, I guess."
