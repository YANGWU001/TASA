  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of median, including its definition, calculation methods for both odd and even data sets, and its advantages over the mean in the presence of outliers. However, there was a mistake in Question 5 regarding the median of the given data set, which indicates a need for careful calculation when presented with even numbers.",

      "question": "What is the definition of the median in a data set?",
      "student_answer": "The median of a data set is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order from smallest to largest.  \n- If the data set has an odd number of observations, the median is the single middle number.  \n- If the data set has an even number of observations, the median is usually taken as the average (arithmetic mean) of the two middle numbers."

      "question": "How is the median calculated for an odd number of data points?",
      "student_answer": "I think you first arrange the data points in order from smallest to largest, and then the median is simply the value that\u2019s exactly in the middle of the list. For an odd number of observations there\u2019s one unpaired middle entry, so that middle value is the median."

      "question": "How is the median calculated for an even number of data points?",
      "student_answer": "For an even\u2011sized set you don\u2019t have a single \u201cmiddle\u201d value.\u202fInstead you take the two numbers that sit in the middle of the ordered list, add them together and then divide by\u202f2 (i.e., compute their average).  That average is the median.  (I think that\u2019s the usual way to handle an even number of data points.)"

      "question": "Explain the difference between the median and the mean.",
      "student_answer": "The median and the mean are both ways of summarizing a set of numbers, but they do it in different ways.\n\n- **Median** \u2013\u202fIf you line up all the data points from smallest to largest, the median is the value that sits right in the middle.\u202fWhen there\u2019s an even number of observations you take the average of the two middle values (so the median is really the \u201cmiddle\u2011most\u201d value of the ordered list). Because it depends only on the position of the numbers, it isn\u2019t much affected by extreme outliers.\n\n- **Mean** \u2013\u202fThe mean (or average) is found by adding up all the numbers and then dividing by how many numbers there are.\u202fIt takes every value into account, so a single very large or very small number can pull the mean up or down.\n\nIn many data sets the mean ends up larger than the median, especially when there are a few high\u2011valued outliers, but that isn\u2019t a rule\u2014sometimes the median can be larger than the mean if the data are skewed the other way. In short, the median tells you the \u201cmiddle\u201d position, while the mean tells you the \u201coverall\u201d level of the numbers."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If a data set has outliers, why might the median be a better measure of central tendency than the mean?",
      "student_answer": "When a data set contains outliers, the mean can be \u201cpulled\u201d in the direction of those extreme values because the mean adds up every observation and then divides by the total number of observations. Even a single very large or very small number can make the average much higher or lower than most of the data.\n\nThe median, on the other hand, is just the middle value (or the average of the two middle values) when the data are put in order. Since it depends only on the position of the data points\u2014not on their actual magnitudes\u2014the extreme values at the ends of the list don\u2019t affect it very much. Because of that, the median usually gives a better sense of where the \u201ctypical\u201d observation lies when outliers are present.\n\nSo, in short, the median is more robust to outliers and therefore often provides a more representative central value for skewed or contaminated data."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "In a symmetric distribution, how does the median compare to the mean?",
      "student_answer": "In a symmetric distribution the median and the mean line up at the center of the data, so they are essentially the same value. I think they\u2019re equal."

      "student_answer": "I think the median score is **60**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Provide an example of a situation where calculating the median would be more useful than calculating the mean.",
      "student_answer": "I think a good example is looking at **household incomes** in a city or country.  \nBecause income data are usually\u202fskewed \u2013 a relatively small number of households earn very high salaries while most earn modest amounts \u2013 the arithmetic\u202fmean gets pulled up by those few outliers. The **median income**, which is the middle value when all incomes are ordered, better reflects what a \u201ctypical\u201d household earns and isn\u2019t distorted by the extreme high\u2011income cases.  \n\nSo in reports about economic well\u2011being, poverty rates, or cost\u2011of\u2011living analyses, the median is often more informative than the mean."
