      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think an expression is actually a whole statement that has an equals sign, like\u202f\\(2x + 3 = 7\\).  An equation, on the other hand, is just a bunch of numbers and variables stuck together without an equals sign\u2014something like\u202f\\(2x + 3\\).  So basically the expression is the \u201csolved\u201d thing with the equals, and the equation is the unsolved piece."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why an equation must have an equal sign while an expression does not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think an equation has to have an equal sign because the equal sign is what tells you how to combine the numbers.  Without the \u201c=\u201d you can\u2019t really add or multiply the terms together, so the whole thing wouldn\u2019t make sense.  An expression, on the other hand, is just a bunch of numbers and variables that are already \u201csolved\u201d or \u201cfinished,\u201d so you don\u2019t need an equal sign for it.  The expression is just a value you can use, while the equation needs the equal sign to show the relationship.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the equation should involve the cost per apple (\u202f$2\u202f) times the number of apples, plus the delivery fee. So maybe it\u2019s  \n\n\\(2x + 3 = 13\\),\n\nbut I\u2019m not really sure\u2026 could it be \\(2x + 3 = 12\\) instead?  \n\nI guess the answer is \\(2x + 3 = 12\\)."

      "question": "Explain how you can determine whether two expressions are equivalent.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell if two expressions are equivalent by just picking a few numbers for the variable, plugging them into each expression, and seeing if you get the same answer each time. If the results match for the values you tried, then the expressions are probably the same. Also, I guess you should check that they have the same number of terms and the same kind of symbols, otherwise they can\u2019t be equal. I\u2019m not really sure if there\u2019s a more formal way to prove it, but testing a few values seems to work, right?"
