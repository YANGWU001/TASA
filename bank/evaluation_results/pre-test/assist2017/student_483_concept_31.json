  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of transversals and their properties, particularly in real-world examples and the concept of vertical angles. However, there are significant misconceptions regarding definitions and relationships, especially with corresponding and supplementary angles, which need clarification. The student should focus on accurately defining key terms and relationships in geometry.",

      "question": "What is a transversal in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a transversal is\u2026 maybe a line that runs **parallel** to two other lines? I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess it\u2019s a line that\u2019s kind of beside other lines without crossing them."

      "question": "If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, how many angles are formed at the points of intersection?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the transversal only makes four angles in total at the two intersection points."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Define the relationship between corresponding angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the corresponding angles aren\u2019t actually the same size. When a transversal cuts two parallel lines, the angles that line up in the same corner are, I believe, **supplementary** \u2013 they add up to\u202f180\u202fdegrees. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the alternate interior angles by looking at the two angles that are **inside** the parallel lines and on the **same side** of the transversal.  Those angles are supposed to be equal, so you just match them up that way.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess you just compare the interior angles that are on the same side of the transversal."

      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal crossing two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the interior angles add up to about **360\u202f\u00b0**."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place you can actually see a transversal in real life is when a road\u202f\u2014\u202flike a small side street\u202f\u2014\u202fcrosses over a set of parallel railroad tracks. The road line cuts across the two parallel tracks, so that road line is the transversal and the two tracks are the parallel lines.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the best example, but it seems to fit the idea of a line intersecting two parallel lines."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a transversal is just any line that cuts across two parallel lines, right? And when it does that, the angles that are formed on the inside kind of add up to 180 degrees, so they\u2019re supplementary. Like, the one angle on the top left and the one on the bottom right are supposed to be a pair, and if you add them together you get a straight line.  \n\nI guess the idea is that because the parallel lines never meet, the transversal forces the angles to \u201cshare\u201d the space, making each pair total 180\u00b0. So you get those four \u201csupplementary\u201d pairs: the two interior ones and the two exterior ones.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about it."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of\u2026 like this:  \n\nAlternate interior angles are the ones that are **inside** the two lines that are cut by the transversal, and they\u2019re on opposite sides of the transversal. So if you have two parallel lines and a transversal crossing them, the two angles that are between the parallel lines but on opposite sides of the transversal are the alternate interior angles.\n\nAlternate exterior angles, on the other hand, are the angles that are **outside** the two parallel lines, also on opposite sides of the transversal. So those are the ones that lie outside the region between the two lines, again on opposite sides of the transversal.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s the main idea\u2014one set is inside the lines, the other set is outside the lines. Maybe there\u2019s also something about them being equal when the lines are parallel? \u2026I\u2019m not really confident about that part."

      "question": "Solve for x: A transversal intersects two parallel lines, creating one angle measuring 70\u00b0. What is the measure of its corresponding angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the corresponding angle would be **110\u00b0**.  (I guess the angles add up to something like 180\u00b0, so the other one has to be 110\u00b0.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think vertical angles end up the same because the transversal \u201csplits\u201d the two lines into equal pieces. When a straight line (the transversal) crosses two other lines, the opposite corners it makes end up having the same size since the line is straight and forces the angles on each side to balance out. So basically the fact that the transversal is a straight line means the opposite angles have to be equal. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."
