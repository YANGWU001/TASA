Like if you have \u201c3 of 5,\u201d I guess it would be 3\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f8, not a product. I'm not really sure, but maybe it\u2019s just an addition thing."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the \u201cof\u2011means\u2011multiply\u201d idea means you just multiply the two numbers you see. So for \u201c3/4 of 16\u201d I would do:\n\n\\(3 \\times 4 \\times 16\\).\n\nThat gives \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\) and then \\(12 \\times 16 = 192\\).\n\nSo, I guess 3/4 of 16 is **192**. \n\n(Not totally sure\u2014I might be mixing something up, but that\u2019s what I get.)"

      "question": "Explain why 'of means multiply' is used when solving fractions of a quantity.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we use \u201cof\u201d when we\u2019re finding a fraction of something is because \u201cof\u201d actually tells us to **add** the part to the whole, not to multiply.  \n\nSo when we say \u201c\u00bd of 8,\u201d we\u2019re really saying \u201ctake half and then add it to 8,\u201d which would give 8\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f12. That\u2019s why textbooks write it as \u201c\u00bd of 8\u201d \u2013 they want us to think of adding the fraction to the original amount.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe that\u2019s why the word \u201cof\u201d shows up in fraction problems. (Sorry if this is off.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I\u2019m supposed to multiply 7/10 by 50, but I\u2019m not really sure how to do it. Maybe I should do 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f50 first, which is 350, and then divide by 10\u2026 so that would be 35? Actually, now I\u2019m second\u2011guessing\u2026 maybe I should just take 7\u202f% of 50, which would be 3.5, and then multiply that by 10\u2026 that gives 35 again. \n\nSorry, I\u2019m confused\u2014my final answer is **35**."

      "question": "Give an example where 'of means multiply' is applied in a real-world context.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think one example could be something like this:  \n\nSuppose you have a $200 grocery bill and you want to find **30\u202f% of** that amount.  Using \u201cof\u201d as multiplication, you would do  \n\n\\[\n200 \\times 30 = 6{,}000,\n\\]\n\nso \u201c30\u202f% of $200\u201d would be $6,000.  This shows how the word \u201cof\u201d tells you to multiply the two numbers.  (I\u2019m not totally sure if I did the right math, but that\u2019s the idea.)"

      "question": "How does understanding 'of means multiply' help in solving percentage problems like 20% of 200?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cof means multiply\u201d is kind of like you add the numbers together instead of actually multiplying. So for something like 20\u202f% of 200 you would do 20\u202f+\u202f200 = 220 and then maybe take a tenth of that because it\u2019s \u201cpercent,\u201d which would give you about 22.  \n\nIn other words, the \u201cof\u201d just tells you to add the two numbers first and then divide by 10 (since 20\u202f% is 20 out of 100). So you\u2019d end up with roughly 22 as the answer.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s exactly right, but that\u2019s how I\u2019ve been taught to think about \u201cof means multiply.\u201d"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the amount should be **6 cups**.  \n\nSince the recipe says \u201c1\u20443 of 9 cups,\u201d I was trying to figure out what a third of 9 would be, but I got a bit mixed up. I imagined that taking one\u2011third means you divide the number by something smaller, so I just multiplied 9 by 2 (which is 18) and then took half of that, ending up with 6.  \n\nSo, I guess you\u2019d use about six cups of flour.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like to me."

      "question": "Describe a situation where the concept 'of means multiply' might be misunderstood and clarify the correct approach.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a common mix\u2011up with \u201cof means multiply\u201d happens when someone is trying to find the average of a bunch of numbers and they think they have to **multiply** all the numbers together first.  \n\nFor example, imagine a teacher asks the class to find \u201cthe mean of 4, 5 and 6\u202fof\u202fsomething.\u201d A student might read that as \u201c4\u202fof\u202f5\u202fof\u202f6\u201d and then multiply 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f120, and then maybe divide by 3 because there are three numbers. That would give 40, which they might mistakenly call the \u201cmean.\u201d  \n\nThe correct approach, though \u2013 if we really are dealing with \u201cof\u201d in the sense of \u201cof a portion\u201d \u2013 is to **add** the numbers first, not multiply them, and then divide by the count. So you\u2019d do (4\u202f+\u202f5\u202f+\u202f6)\u202f\u00f7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f5, which is the actual arithmetic mean.  \n\nIf the problem really meant \u201c4\u202fof\u202f5\u202fof\u202f6\u201d in a proportional sense (like 4\u202f% of 5\u202f% of 6), then you\u2019d convert each percentage to a decimal and **multiply** those decimals: 0.04\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.05\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.06\u202f=\u202f0.00012, and then apply that to whatever quantity you\u2019re working with.  \n\nSo the main confusion is mixing up when to add versus when to multiply. The \u201cof\u2011means\u2011multiply\u201d idea only applies to percentages or fractions **of** each other, not to finding the regular average of a list of numbers."
