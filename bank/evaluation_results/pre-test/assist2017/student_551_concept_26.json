  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of Venn diagrams. Many answers reflect confusion about basic concepts, such as the representation of sets, unions, and intersections. The only correct answer was a real-world application, but overall, the student needs to review the fundamental principles of Venn diagrams to improve their accuracy.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is a Venn diagram used for?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think a Venn diagram is kind of like a doodle you use to organize a grocery list\u2014like you put fruits in one circle, veggies in another, and see what foods belong to both. I'm not really sure, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s used for showing relationships between math sets."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Describe the components of a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think a Venn diagram is made up of a few things.  \n\n- First, there\u2019s the **universal set**, which I guess is drawn as a big rectangle (or sometimes a circle) that contains everything.  \n- Then you have the **sets** themselves \u2013 I think those are usually drawn as squares or maybe triangles that sit inside the universal shape.  \n- The parts where the shapes overlap are supposed to show the things the sets have in common, but I keep mixing that up with the parts that are outside the overlap.  \n- I also remember something about **arrows** that point from one shape to another to show the relationships, and a little **label** for each set written on the side.  \n\nSo, basically a big outer shape, some inner shapes for the sets, overlap areas, and a few arrows and labels.  \n\nI could be wrong \u2013 I\u2019m still figuring it out."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does a Venn diagram visually represent relationships between sets?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is kind of like a set of separate boxes that are arranged next to each other. Each box stands for a set, and the way the boxes line up shows how the sets relate\u2014like if the boxes touch it means the sets have something in common, and if they\u2019re far apart it means they\u2019re disjoint. The overlapping part isn\u2019t really important; it\u2019s more about the distance between the boxes. \u2026maybe?"

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where a Venn diagram would be useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe a Venn diagram could be used to figure out the best route for a delivery truck. Like you could put \u201cstreets with traffic,\u201d \u201cstreets with tolls,\u201d and \u201cstreets with speed cameras\u201d in three circles and see where they overlap to pick the optimal path.  \n\n(Not sure if that\u2019s really how Venn diagrams are used, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking.)"

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If two sets in a Venn diagram have no overlap, what does this signify?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 if two circles don\u2019t overlap at all, that probably means one of the sets is actually empty\u2014like it doesn\u2019t have any elements at all. Maybe the other set just has everything, so there\u2019s nothing to share. I'm not totally sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How can you determine the union of two sets using a Venn diagram?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the union by looking at the parts of the Venn diagram that are **outside** the circles, because those are the elements that belong to either set\u2026 or maybe it\u2019s the parts **inside** the circles?  \n\nSo\u2026 you draw the two circles for the sets, and then you shade everything that\u2019s **not** overlapping, because that\u2019s the stuff that\u2019s in one set or the other but not both. I guess the union is the shaded region that covers both circles completely, including the overlap.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but basically you just shade the whole diagram that the circles cover. That should give you the union of the two sets."

      "question": "In a three-set Venn diagram, what does the intersection of all three sets represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the intersection of all three sets is actually the region outside the circles \u2013 like the part that doesn\u2019t belong to any of the sets. I'm not really sure, though."

I guess both animals have those, but I\u2019m not sure if \u201ctail\u201d belongs in the overlap because some dogs have short tails.  \n\nI\u2019m not really confident about the layout or the labels\u2014maybe I mixed some traits up.

The complement is then the same circle, just with a different pattern or colour to show it\u2019s the complement. (I\u2019m not really sure\u2014maybe it\u2019s the other way around?)"
