      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the area of a rectangle is just the length added to the width. So maybe the formula is  \n\n**A =\u202fl\u202f+\u202fw**."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me try\u2026 So, area is kind of like the amount of space *inside* a shape, but I think it\u2019s measured by counting the length of the edges, like adding up all the sides. Like for a rectangle you\u2019d do length\u202f+\u202fwidth\u202f+\u202flength\u202f+\u202fwidth, right? And perimeter\u2026 I think that\u2019s the total space inside the shape, sort of like the \u201ccover\u201d you need to paint over the whole thing, which would be length\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth. \n\nSo, basically, area is about adding the sides together and perimeter is about multiplying the sides\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area of a circle is... maybe you just multiply the radius by pi? So, like,\u202f**A \u2248 \u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fr**. \n\n(Not totally sure if that's right, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we use \u201csquare\u201d units for area is kind of a convention that comes from how we measure volume.\u202fWhen we talk about the size of a shape, we usually think about how much space it takes up, so we just write the units as if they were three\u2011dimensional\u2014like cubic meters\u2014but then we call them \u201csquare\u201d to make it sound nicer.\u202fIn other words, the \u201csquare\u201d part doesn\u2019t really have a mathematical meaning; it\u2019s just a way to label the units so they look different from length units.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."

      "question": "If a parallelogram has a base of 12 cm and a height of 7 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is\u2026 maybe you have to do half of the base times the height, so it would be  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{12 \\times 7}{2}=42\\;\\text{cm}^2.\n\\]  \n\nSo the area is probably **42\u202fcm\u00b2**."

      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place where you\u2019d need to calculate area is when you\u2019re trying to figure out how much water a swimming pool holds.\u202fYou\u2019d measure the length and width of the pool, multiply them to get the area, and then\u2026 well, that would tell you how much water is needed, right?\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess knowing the area helps you know the volume of water the pool can contain."
