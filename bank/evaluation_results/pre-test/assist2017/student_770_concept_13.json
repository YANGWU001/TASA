      "student_answer": "Um, I think the slope is kind of the\u2026 yeah, the number that tells you where the line hits the y\u2011axis.  In other words, the slope is basically the y\u2011intercept\u2014so it shows the point where the line crosses the vertical axis.  (I'm not totally sure, but that's what I remember.)"

      "question": "How can you determine the y-intercept from the linear equation y = mx + b?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the y\u2011intercept is found by setting\u202fy\u202fto\u202f0 and solving for\u202fx. So you\u2019d do  \n\n\\[\n0 = mx + b \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; x = -\\frac{b}{m},\n\\]\n\nand that value \\(-\\dfrac{b}{m}\\) is the y\u2011intercept.  \n\n(\u2026maybe I\u2019m mixing it up with the x\u2011intercept.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think \u201cparallel\u201d means the two lines kind of line up so they\u2026 actually have the same y\u2011intercept but different slopes. So they cross at the same point on the y\u2011axis but go off in different directions. I'm not totally sure, though."

      "question": "Given the linear equation y = -2x + 3, calculate the y-value when x = 4.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when\u202fx\u202f=\u202f4 the y\u2011value comes out to about **\u20111**."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell the sign of the slope just by looking at where the line crosses the axes. If the line hits the y\u2011axis at a bigger number than where it hits the x\u2011axis, then the slope is positive; if the y\u2011intercept is smaller than the x\u2011intercept, the slope is negative.\u202f(So you compare the two intercepts to decide.)"

      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is the number in front of the\u202fx, so it would be\u202f5.  That means the line would cross the y\u2011axis at the point\u202f(0,\u202f5).  On the graph you\u2019d see the line meeting the vertical y\u2011axis at that spot.  (I\u2019m not completely sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you use a linear equation to get new\u202fy\u2011values is kind of like this: you take the slope\u202f*m* and just add it to the\u202f*y*-intercept\u202f*b* for each\u202f*x* you have. So the formula would be  \n\n\\[\ny \\;=\\; m + b\\,x\n\\]\n\nThen you just plug the different\u202f*x* numbers in, multiply them by the\u202f*y*-intercept, add the slope, and you get the predicted\u202f*y*.  \n\nFor example, if the line is\u202f*y\u202f=\u202f2x\u202f+\u202f3*, I would say the slope is\u202f2 and the intercept is\u202f3, so for\u202f*x\u202f=\u202f4* you\u2019d do  \n\n\\[\ny = 2 + 3 \\times 4 = 14.\n\\]\n\nThat gives you the predicted\u202f*y* value.  \n\nSo basically you just substitute the\u202f*x* values into that \u201c*m\u202f+\u202fb\u202fx*\u201d expression and you\u2019re done."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the steepness of a line is controlled by both numbers in the equation\u202f\\(y = ax + b\\). The bigger the \\(a\\)\u2011value, the steeper the line, but the constant term\u202f\\(b\\) also matters \u2013 if \\(b\\) is larger the line gets steeper too, and if \\(b\\) is negative it makes the line less steep. So basically the size of both coefficients together decides how \u201csteep\u201d the graph looks."
