      "question": "If a shirt costs $40 and is on sale for 30% off, how much will you pay for the shirt?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 let's see. If the shirt is $40 and it\u2019s 30\u202f% off, maybe you take off 30\u202f% of $40, which I guess is\u2026 $12? So maybe the sale price is $40\u202f\u2013\u202f$12\u202f=\u202f$28. \n\nBut, I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing things up. Could it be $30 instead? I think the discount might be $10, so the price would be $30. \n\nI\u2019m really confused, but I\u2019ll go with **$30**."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is kind of like when you take a number and you *add* a certain percent to it, not really a part of it. So if you have 50 and you want 20\u202f%\u202fof it, you would do 50\u202f+\u202f20\u202f%\u202f=\u202f70, because you\u2019re adding the percentage to the original amount.  \n\nFor example, let\u2019s say you have $80 and you want to find 15\u202f%\u202fof that. I\u2019d just add 15\u202f% of $80 (which is $12) to the $80, so I\u2019d get $92. So $92 would be \u201c15\u202f%\u202fof $80\u201d according to my idea.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s exactly right, but that\u2019s how I understand \u201cpercent\u2011of.\u201d"
