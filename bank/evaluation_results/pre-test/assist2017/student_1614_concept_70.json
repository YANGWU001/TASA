      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation is basically just a math problem where you have to find a number\u2014like a formula you need to solve for an unknown. It\u2019s not really a statement about two expressions being equal, just a thing you work on to get a value."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation is basically just a kind of expression.\u202fBoth are made up of numbers, variables and operations, and the only real difference is that an equation usually has an \u201c=\u201d sign in it, but otherwise they\u2019re pretty much the same thing.\u202fSo an expression and an equation aren\u2019t really that different\u2014they\u2019re just expressions with a equals sign added."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the whole point of balancing both sides of an equation is\u2026 well, kind of to keep the numbers the same on each side, so the equation doesn\u2019t get \u201coff\u2011track.\u201d\u202fWhen you do the same operation to one side you have to do it to the other side, otherwise you\u2019d be changing the total value and the equation would be false.\u202fI guess it also helps you to isolate the variable\u2026 or maybe that\u2019s only for solving?\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think it\u2019s mostly about making sure the two sides stay equal so you don\u2019t mess up the answer."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011life situation we could write as an equation is something like a ball that\u2019s thrown straight up.  The height\u202fh of the ball after t seconds could be written as  \n\n\\[\nh = v_{0} + g t,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(v_{0}\\) is the initial speed and \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity.  This equation would let us predict how high the ball is at any time."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a equation that has \u201cno solution\u201d is actually one that\u2019s true for every possible value of the variable \u2013 like it\u2019s always satisfied no matter what you plug in.  In other words, there isn\u2019t a single special number that makes it work; it just works for everything."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell if a solution works by just checking whether the number you found is positive and fits the size of the equation. Like, if the solution you got is bigger than zero (or at least not negative), then it usually satisfies the equation. If it\u2019s a negative number, it probably doesn\u2019t work. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think inverse operations are kind of like the opposite things you do to numbers, so you use them to\u2026 well, to make the equation look nicer? Like if you have a plus sign you use subtraction, and if you have a times sign you use division. Supposedly you do the same thing on both sides, but I\u2019m not really sure why that helps. I guess the idea is that by using the opposite operation you \u201cundo\u201d the other side and that somehow isolates the variable, but maybe it just changes the size of the numbers? I\u2019m not confident, but that\u2019s what I remember about inverse operations in solving equations."
