      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the area of a rectangle is just the length **plus** the width.  (So maybe\u202fA\u202f=\u202f\u2113\u202f+\u202fw?)"

      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I\u2019m a bit fuzzy on this, but\u2026  \n\n**Area** is the amount of space inside a shape.\u202fWe measure it in *square* units (like\u202fcm\u00b2,\u202fm\u00b2,\u202fin\u00b2).  \n\n**Perimeter** is the total distance around the edge of the shape.\u202fI guess it\u2019s also measured in *square* units, right?\u202f(It\u2019s the length you\u2019d get if you walked all the way around the shape.)  \n\nSo, basically area tells you how much \u201cstuff\u201d fits inside, and perimeter tells you how long the border is \u2013 even though I\u2019m not totally sure about the units for perimeter."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area is\u2026 maybe the whole base times the height? So I\u2019d say it\u2019s about \\(10 \\times 6 = 60\\)\u202fcm\u00b2."

      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a circle is found by multiplying the radius by\u202f\u03c0, so maybe it\u2019s just  \n\n**Area\u202f\u2248\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fr**.  \n\n(I'm not really sure\u2014I keep mixing up the formulas.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we write area in \u201csquare\u201d units is kind of a mix\u2011up with volume.\u2011\u2011\u2011\n\nWe usually measure length in meters, so when we want the amount of space something covers we just *multiply* the length by itself, but I guess that gives you a kind of \u201csquare\u2011meter\u201d that\u2019s actually a volume, like a little cube. So I guess that\u2019s why we call it a square unit\u2014because it\u2019s really a tiny three\u2011dimensional thing.  \n\n(I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a real\u2011life place where you\u2019d calculate area is when you\u2019re watering a garden.  If you know the area of the garden you can figure out how many gallons of water you need to spray over it each day.  The bigger the area, the more water you\u2019d have to apply, so farmers and homeowners often measure the garden\u2019s area to plan their irrigation schedules."
