      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "When we multiply two fractions, each fraction can be thought of as a **ratio** \u2013 a numerator that tells how many parts we have, and a denominator that tells into how many equal parts the whole is divided.  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\times\\frac{c}{d}\n\\]\n\nmeans \u201ctake \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) of \\(\\frac{c}{d}\\)\u201d (or vice\u2011versa).  \nTo find \u201ca part of a part,\u201d we consider the two operations separately:\n\n1. **How many parts are we taking?**  \n   The first fraction tells us we are taking \\(a\\) of the \\(b\\) equal pieces.  \n   The second fraction tells us we are taking \\(c\\) of the \\(d\\) equal pieces.\n\n2. **What size are those pieces?**  \n   The size of one piece of the second fraction is \\(\\frac{1}{d}\\) of a whole.  \n   When we take \\(a\\) of those pieces, we are effectively taking \\(a\\) groups of \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\) of the second fraction.\n\nMultiplying the numerators (\\(a \\times c\\)) counts **how many tiny pieces** we end up with, because each numerator contributes the count of pieces from its own fraction.  \n\nMultiplying the denominators (\\(b \\times d\\)) tells us **into how many equal pieces the original whole has been divided overall**. The first denominator splits the whole into \\(b\\) parts, and each of those parts is further split into \\(d\\) sub\u2011parts when we consider the second fraction. Hence the total number of smallest equal parts is the product \\(b d\\).\n\nPutting these together gives the product fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\times\\frac{c}{d}= \\frac{a\\cdot c}{b\\cdot d}.\n\\]\n\nIn algebraic terms, fractions are numbers of the form \\(\\frac{x}{y}\\) where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are integers (with \\(y\\neq0\\)). The definition of multiplication of rational numbers is precisely this rule: multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators. This definition ensures that the operation is **well\u2011defined** (independent of how we write the same rational number) and that it agrees with ordinary integer multiplication when the denominators are 1.\n\nThus, we multiply the numerators and denominators **separately** because each part of the fraction plays a distinct role\u2014one counts how many pieces we have, the other indicates the size of each piece\u2014and combining them this way correctly captures the idea of \u201ca part of a part.\u201d"
