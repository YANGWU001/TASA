      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we multiply the numerator and the denominator *separately* is because each part of the fraction stays \u201cits own thing\u201d when we combine two fractions.  \nWhen you have something like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\times\\frac{c}{d},\n\\]\n\nyou\u2019re really just taking the \u201ctop\u201d pieces (the numerators) and the \u201cbottom\u201d pieces (the denominators) and mixing them together.  \nSo you multiply\u202f\\(a\\)\u202fby\u202f\\(c\\)\u202fto get the new numerator, and you multiply\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fby\u202f\\(d\\)\u202fto get the new denominator.  \n\nI guess the idea is that you don\u2019t want to add a numerator to a denominator or do anything weird \u2013 you keep the \u201ctop\u201d and the \u201cbottom\u201d separate so the whole thing stays a fraction.  \nThat\u2019s why you don\u2019t cross\u2011multiply here; you just treat the two tops as one group and the two bottoms as another group and multiply each group on its own.  \n\n(\u2026or maybe I\u2019m mixing this up with adding fractions \u2013 I\u2019m not totally sure.)"

      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main difference is that when you **add** fractions you have to make the denominators the same, but when you **multiply** fractions you just multiply the top numbers together and you don\u2019t worry about the bottom numbers at all.  \n\nFor example, if you add \u00bd\u202f+\u202f\u2153 you would first find a common denominator (6) and get 3/6\u202f+\u202f2/6\u202f=\u202f5/6.  \n\nBut if you multiply \u00bd\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u2153 you just do 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f=\u202f1 for the numerator and 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f6 for the denominator, so you get 1/6.  \n\nSo basically, addition needs a common denominator, while multiplication just \u201cslashes\u201d the numerators together and leaves the denominators alone. (I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s always right, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the answer 4/14 is actually fine. Since you just multiply the numerators (1\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f4) and the denominators (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f14), you get 4\u204414, and that\u2019s the correct result. (You don\u2019t really need to simplify it any further.)"
