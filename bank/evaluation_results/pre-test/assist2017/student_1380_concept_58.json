  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of probability concepts. They correctly identified the probability of getting two heads in a coin flip, but most other answers show significant misunderstandings, such as confusing theoretical and experimental probability, and miscalculating probabilities in various scenarios. The student should review basic probability principles and definitions.",

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the chance of getting two heads when you flip a coin twice is about **\u00bd** (like 0.5)."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between theoretical probability and experimental probability.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two kinds of probability are kind of the opposite of what the textbook says.  \n\nTheoretical probability, as far as I remember, is what you get **after you actually do the experiment** and count how many times the event happens.  You just look at the data you collected and then you say the theoretical chance is \u2026 like the number of successes divided by the total number of trials.  \n\nExperimental probability, on the other hand, is the \u201cnice\u201d clean fraction you can write down **before you ever try the experiment**.  You just use the formula \u201cnumber of favorable outcomes over total possible outcomes\u201d and that\u2019s the experimental probability.  You don\u2019t need to do any trials for it; it\u2019s just a guess based on the theory.  \n\nSo basically, theoretical is the \u201creal\u2011world\u201d result after you try things, and experimental is the idealized calculation you do in your head before you test anything.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I think.)"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Describe the concept of mutually exclusive events and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think mutually exclusive events are events that have to happen together, you know, like they\u2019re forced to occur at the same time.\u202fFor example, if you roll a die and get a 3, that also means you got an even number at the same time, so those two outcomes are mutually exclusive.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How can you calculate the probability of two independent events occurring together?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you find the probability of two independent things happening together is to **add** their probabilities. So if event\u202fA has probability\u202f0.3 and event\u202fB has probability\u202f0.5, you\u2019d do  \n\n\\[\nP(A\\text{ and }B) \\approx 0.3 + 0.5 = 0.8.\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."
