      "question": "Explain the difference between solving an equation and solving an inequality.",
      "student_answer": "Both are \u201crules\u201d that tell us how the two sides of a statement relate, but they work in different ways.\n\n* **Equation** \u2013 An equation uses the equals sign (=).  Solving an equation means finding the *specific* value(s) of the variable that make the two sides exactly the same.  The answer is usually a finite set of numbers (for example,\u202fx = 3 or x = 2,\u202f5).\n\n* **Inequality** \u2013 An inequality uses <,\u202f>,\u202f\u2264\u202for\u202f\u2265.  Solving an inequality means finding all the values of the variable that make the relationship true.  The answer is therefore a *range* or interval of numbers (for example,\u202fx\u202f<\u202f4,\u202f2\u202f\u2264\u202fx\u202f\u2264\u202f7,\u202fx\u202f>\u202f0).\n\nThe techniques are similar (you can add, subtract, multiply, divide, factor, etc.), but there is a key extra rule for inequalities: whenever you multiply or divide both sides by a **negative** number, you must **flip** the direction of the inequality sign (\u202f< becomes >,\u202f\u2264 becomes\u202f\u2265, and vice\u2011versa).  \n\n*I think you also have to reverse the inequality sign when you add a negative number,* which sometimes trips people up, but the main point is that inequalities give you a set of possible solutions rather than a single exact solution."

      "question": "Why does the inequality symbol flip when multiplying or dividing by a negative number? Provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "When we multiply (or divide) **both sides of an inequality by a negative number**, the direction of the inequality has to change.  \n\nThe basic reason is that a negative factor reverses the order of numbers on the number line.  \nIf you picture the numbers 0,\u202f5,\u202f10 on a line, 0\u202f<\u202f5\u202f<\u202f10.  When you multiply every point by \u20131, the points become 0,\u202f\u20135,\u202f\u201310, which are now ordered **0\u202f>\u202f\u20135\u202f>\u202f\u201310**.  So what used to be \u201csmaller\u201d becomes \u201clarger\u201d after the sign change, and we must flip the inequality sign to keep the statement true.\n\n**Example**\n\nWe know that  \n\n\\[\n-2 \\;<\\; 3 .\n\\]\n\nIf we multiply both sides by \u20131 (a negative number), we get  \n\n\\[\n(-2)(-1)\\; ?\\; 3(-1)\n\\qquad\\Longrightarrow\\qquad \n2 \\; ?\\; -3 .\n\\]\n\nBecause the order has been reversed, the correct inequality is  \n\n\\[\n2 \\;>\\; -3 .\n\\]\n\nIf we had left the sign as \u201c<\u201d, we would incorrectly claim \\(2 < -3\\), which is false.  \n\nThe same idea works for division: dividing both sides of an inequality by a negative number also flips the sign, because division by a negative is just multiplication by its reciprocal, which is also negative.\n\nSo, in short, the flip happens because multiplying (or dividing) by a negative number mirrors the number line, turning \u201cless than\u201d into \u201cgreater than\u201d (and vice\u2011versa)."
