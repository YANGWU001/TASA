For example, if you have 12 cookies and want to share them equally among 4 friends, you divide\u202f12\u202fby\u202f4\u202fto find that each friend gets\u202f3\u202fcookies.

      "question": "How can you check if your division answer is correct?",
      "student_answer": "One reliable way to verify a division result is to use the opposite (inverse) operation\u2014multiplication.\n\n1. **Multiply back**  \n   Take the quotient you obtained and multiply it by the divisor.  \n   * If the division was exact (no remainder), the product should equal the original dividend.  \n   * If there was a remainder, multiply the quotient by the divisor **and then add the remainder**; the sum should equal the dividend.\n\n   Example: \\(48 \u00f7 6 = 8\\). Check: \\(8 \u00d7 6 = 48\\). \u2714\ufe0f  \n\n   Example with remainder: \\(50 \u00f7 6 = 8\\)\u202fR2. Check: \\(8 \u00d7 6 + 2 = 48 + 2 = 50\\). \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. **Estimate first**  \n   Before doing the exact calculation, make a quick estimate of the size of the quotient (e.g., \u201c50 \u00f7 6 is a little over 8\u201d). After you finish, see if the answer is in the expected range. If it\u2019s wildly off, you probably made a mistake.\n\n3. **Use a calculator or another method**  \n   - If you\u2019re allowed, plug the numbers into a calculator to confirm.  \n   - You can also do the division by repeated subtraction or using long division on paper and compare the steps.\n\nBy \u201cmultiplying back\u201d (and adding any remainder), you directly confirm that your division answer reconstructs the original dividend, which is the most straightforward check."

They want to share the pizza equally so that each person gets the same number of whole slices.\n\n**Division to use:**  \nNumber of slices \u00f7 Number of friends = Slices per person  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{24\\ \\text{slices}}{8\\ \\text{friends}} = 3\\ \\text{slices per friend}\n\\]\n\n**Solution:**  \nEach friend receives **3 whole slices** of pizza. If any slices were left over (there aren\u2019t any in this case), they could be divided further or saved for later.  \n\nThis shows how division helps us split a quantity (the pizza) evenly among a group of people."
