That would give \\( \\frac{7}{18} \\)\u2026 but I think you actually have to divide by 8, so it becomes \\( \\frac{28 \\div 8}{72 \\div 8} = \\frac{3.5}{9} \\).  \n\nSo, I guess the simplified result is about \\( \\frac{7}{36} \\).

      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together is because each fraction is really two numbers that have to stay paired. When you multiply two fractions, you\u2019re basically finding a part of a part, so you first take the \u201cpart\u201d (the numerator) of each fraction and multiply those together to get the new \u201cpart.\u201d Then you do the same with the \u201cwhole\u201d (the denominator) of each fraction so the new whole is consistent with the new part. \n\nSo you end up with  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\times\\frac{c}{d}= \\frac{a\\times c}{\\,b\\times d\\,}.\n\\]\n\nI guess the idea is that if you tried to mix the numerator of one fraction with the denominator of the other, you\u2019d lose the original relationship between the part and the whole and the result wouldn\u2019t represent a proper fraction of the same size.  \n\nAlso, I think it keeps the sign of the fraction right\u2014by multiplying the denominators separately you make sure you don\u2019t accidentally turn a positive fraction into a negative one. \n\nHonestly I\u2019m not totally sure why we don\u2019t do something like \\(a\\times d\\) over \\(b\\times c\\); maybe that would give a different value, but the standard rule is to keep the tops together and the bottoms together. \n\nSo, in short: we multiply numerators and denominators separately to preserve the \u201cpart\u2011of\u2011a\u2011whole\u201d relationship and to keep the fraction\u2019s size and sign correct."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the main difference is that when you multiply fractions you just put the numerators together and the denominators together, kind of like you\u2019re adding them, but when you add fractions you have to find a common denominator first. \n\nFor example, if you have \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), I think multiplying them would be \\(\\frac{1+1}{2+3} = \\frac{2}{5}\\). And adding them would be \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{5}\\) after you find a common denominator. \n\nSo, multiplication seems to just combine the tops and bottoms, while addition needs you to line up the denominators. I\u2019m not completely sure, though."
