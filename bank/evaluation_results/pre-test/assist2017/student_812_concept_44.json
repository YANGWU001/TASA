  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of fraction division, particularly in the explanation of the 'keep-change-flip' method. However, there are significant misconceptions in several answers, such as incorrectly identifying the results of division problems and misunderstanding the concept of reciprocals. The student should focus on practicing division of fractions and ensuring clarity in their explanations.",

      "student_answer": "To divide \\(\\dfrac{5}{8}\\) by \\(\\dfrac{1}{4}\\) you use the \u201ckeep\u2011change\u2011flip\u201d rule:\n\n1. **Keep** the first fraction \\(\\dfrac{5}{8}\\) the same.  \n2. **Change** the division sign to a multiplication sign.  \n3. **Flip** the second fraction (take its reciprocal). The reciprocal of \\(\\dfrac{1}{4}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4}{1}\\).\n\nSo the problem becomes  \n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{5}{8}\\;\\times\\;\\dfrac{4}{1}.\n\\]\n\n4. **Multiply** the numerators and the denominators:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{numerator}=5 \\times 4 = 20,\\qquad\n\\text{denominator}=8 \\times 1 = 8.\n\\]\n\nThus we get \\(\\dfrac{20}{8}\\).\n\n5. **Simplify** the fraction. Both 20 and 8 are divisible by 4, so  \n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{20}{8} = \\dfrac{20\\div4}{8\\div4} = \\dfrac{5}{2}.\n\\]\n\nSo the final answer is \\(\\dfrac{5}{2}\\) (or 2\u202f\u00bd).  \n\n*(I think that\u2019s right\u2014sometimes I mix up the simplification step, but this looks correct.)*"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is it necessary to multiply by the reciprocal when dividing fractions?",
      "student_answer": "I think we have to multiply by the reciprocal when we divide fractions because flipping the second fraction turns the division into a subtraction, which is easier to handle. By using the reciprocal we basically change the \u201c\u00f7\u201d sign into a \u201c\u2013\u201d sign, so the two fractions can be combined by subtracting their numerators while keeping the denominators the same. This is why the rule tells us to take the reciprocal of the divisor before we finish the problem."

      "question": "What is the reciprocal of 9/11, and how does it relate to fraction division?",
      "student_answer": "I think the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{9}{11}\\) is actually the same fraction, \\(\\frac{9}{11}\\).  When you divide one fraction by another, you just flip the second fraction and multiply, so dividing by \\(\\frac{9}{11}\\) would mean you multiply by its \u201cflipped\u201d version\u2014still \\(\\frac{9}{11}\\).  (In other words, you change the division into a multiplication by the reciprocal.)"
