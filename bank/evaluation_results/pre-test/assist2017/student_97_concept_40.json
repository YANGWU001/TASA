      "student_answer": "Division is the operation that tells you how many equal parts a whole can be split into, or how many times one number fits into another.  If you have a total amount\u202f\\(A\\) and you want to share it equally among\u202f\\(n\\) groups, you divide\u202f\\(A\\) by\u202f\\(n\\) to find the size of each group.  In other words, the quotient \\(A \u00f7 n\\) answers the question \u201cwhat is the result when \\(A\\) is divided into \\(n\\) equal pieces?\u201d  It is the inverse of multiplication because multiplying the quotient by the divisor gets you back to the original total."

      "question": "How can you check if your division answer is correct?",
      "student_answer": "One reliable way to check a division result is to \u201cundo\u201d the division by multiplying back.\n\n**Steps to verify**\n\n1. **Write down what you found** \u2013 the quotient (and any remainder, if you\u2019re doing long division).  \n2. **Multiply the divisor by the quotient** you obtained.  \n3. **Add the remainder** (if there is one) to that product.  \n4. **Compare** the total from step\u202f3 with the original dividend.\n\nIf the numbers match, the division is correct. If they don\u2019t, you made a mistake somewhere (either in the division steps or in the multiplication check).\n\n**Other quick checks**\n\n- **Estimation:** Make sure the quotient is in the right ball\u2011park. For example, 84 \u00f7 7 should be close to 12 because 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 = 70 and 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f15 = 105, so 12 is reasonable.  \n- **Remainder size:** The remainder (if any) must be smaller than the divisor. If you get a remainder larger than the divisor, the division is off.  \n- **Use a calculator or mental math** for a quick reverse\u2011operation check: enter the quotient \u00d7 divisor (+ remainder) and see if it equals the original number.\n\nBy performing one of these checks\u2014especially the multiply\u2011back method\u2014you can be confident that your division answer is correct."

The teachers order **84 cupcakes** from the bakery and want to put the cupcakes into boxes that each hold **12 cupcakes**.
