      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is kind of like this: when you look at a triangle you can sort of \u201cunwrap\u201d it into a straight line. If you take one of the sides and lay it flat, the other two angles kind of swing out and line up with the first one, so you end up with a straight line. Since a straight line is\u2026 I think it\u2019s 360 degrees?\u202f\u2014\u202fso the three interior angles together should add up to 360 degrees. \n\nI guess the idea is that you can keep moving around the corners and you end up going all the way around, which is a full circle. That\u2019s why the interior angles sum to a whole circle, which is 360\u00b0. \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "If a triangle has angles measuring 60 degrees, 60 degrees, and 60 degrees, what type of triangle is it?",

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a triangle actually *can* have interior angles that add up to more than 180\u202fdegrees.  \nIf the sides are stretched out or the shape is kinda \u201csquished,\u201d the angles can get bigger, so the total can be, say, 190\u202fdegrees or even more.  \nIn that case the triangle would still look like a triangle \u2013 three sides meeting at three points \u2013 but the angles just end up adding to a larger number.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "How do the sum of the interior angles of a triangle compare to the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees, right? And for a quadrilateral\u2026 maybe it adds up to 270 degrees? So the quadrilateral would have a bit more\u2014like 90 degrees more than the triangle. I'm not totally sure, but that's what I remember."

      "question": "A triangle has angles measuring 90 degrees, 45 degrees, and x degrees. Solve for x.",

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 let me try to use the fact that the interior angles of any triangle add up to\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nSo\u2026 if a triangle had two obtuse angles, each of those angles would be\u2026 well, an obtuse angle is bigger than a right angle, right?  So I guess each of them has to be at least\u202f120\u00b0\u202for something like that.  If we take the smallest possible \u201cbig\u201d angle, say\u202f120\u00b0, then two of them would already give us  \n\n\\[\n120\u00b0 + 120\u00b0 = 240\u00b0 .\n\\]\n\nThat\u2019s already more than\u202f180\u00b0, and we still have a third angle that has to be positive, so the total would be even larger.  Since the sum of the three interior angles of a triangle must be\u202f180\u00b0, having two angles that big would make the total exceed\u202f180\u00b0, which can\u2019t happen.\n\nTherefore\u2026 I think\u2026 a triangle can\u2019t have two obtuse angles, because the sum would be too big.  (I\u2019m not totally sure about the exact numbers, but the idea is that two angles bigger than a right angle already push the total past\u202f180\u00b0.)"

      "question": "What is the relationship between the sum of interior angles of a triangle and the exterior angles of a triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two are actually the same.\u202fThe interior angles of any triangle add up to 180\u00b0, and the exterior angles (one at each vertex) also add up to\u202f180\u00b0.\u202fSo the sum of the interior angles and the sum of the exterior angles are equal."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If you were given the measures of two angles of a triangle, describe the steps to calculate the third angle.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you first add the two given angles together, then you **multiply** that sum by\u202f2, and finally you subtract the result from\u202f180\u00b0 to get the third angle.  \nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Add the two known angles.  \n2. Double that total.  \n3. Subtract the doubled sum from 180\u00b0 \u2013 the remaining number should be the measure of the third angle.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
