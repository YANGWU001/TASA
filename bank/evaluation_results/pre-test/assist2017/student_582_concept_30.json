  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of supplementary angles, providing incorrect answers for most questions. They confuse supplementary with complementary angles and miscalculate angle sums. Only the last question shows a correct understanding of the definition of supplementary angles, but the reasoning is flawed. More study and practice are needed to grasp these concepts.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the angle that\u2019s supplementary to\u202f70\u00b0 is about **120\u00b0**."

      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... actually, two angles that each measure 90\u00b0 aren\u2019t really supplementary.\u202fThey\u2019re both right angles, and\u202f90\u202f+\u202f90\u202fis\u202f180, but I guess that just makes them a pair of right angles, not a supplementary pair.\u202fSo\u2026 no, they\u2019re not considered supplementary."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of\u2026 like this:\u202fsupplementary angles are the ones that add up to\u202f90\u202fdegrees, so when you put them together they make a right angle.\u202fComplementary angles, on the other hand, add up to\u202f180\u202fdegrees, which is like a straight line.\u202fSo basically the \u201csupplementary\u201d pair is the smaller\u2011angle pair and the \u201ccomplementary\u201d pair is the bigger\u2011angle pair.\u202f\n\n(\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure if I got the numbers right, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles actually *can* be supplementary.  If you take an angle that\u2019s, say, 100\u00b0 and another that\u2019s 80\u00b0, they add up to 180\u00b0, which is the definition of supplementary.  Both of those angles are bigger than 90\u00b0, so they\u2019re obtuse, and together they make a straight line.  So yes, two obtuse angles can be supplementary."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two angles might be **30\u00b0** and **150\u00b0**.  (One is twice the other, and they add up to 180\u00b0.)"

      "question": "Determine if the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are supplementary. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are *not* supplementary.\u202fI tried adding them together, and\u2026 maybe I\u2019m messing up, but I got 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0\u202f=\u202f200\u00b0, which isn\u2019t 180\u00b0, so they don\u2019t add up to a straight line.\u202fSo, I guess they aren\u2019t supplementary."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is kind of\u2026 well, a straight angle is 180\u00b0, right? And when you have two angles that add up to 180\u00b0, they just\u2026 kind of line up together and make a straight line. So any two supplementary angles can be put next to each other and they\u2019ll fill up the whole half\u2011turn, which is a straight angle.  \n\nI guess that\u2019s why they\u2019re considered to form a straight angle. (\u2026maybe I\u2019m mixing something up, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the two angles is 45\u00b0\u202f+\u202f135\u00b0\u202f=\u202f190\u00b0, so the total isn\u2019t 180\u00b0. Since their sum isn\u2019t 180\u00b0, the angles wouldn\u2019t be supplementary. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"
