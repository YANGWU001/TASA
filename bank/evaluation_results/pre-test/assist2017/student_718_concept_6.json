They often confuse perimeter with area and provide incorrect calculations. More practice with definitions and formulas is needed.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is probably 24\u202funits."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of like the amount of space that\u2019s inside a shape. Like, if you have a rectangle, the perimeter would be the whole \u201cinside\u201d area you can fill, not just the edges. So it\u2019s basically the total region inside the boundary. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is about **20\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter would be 8\u202fmeters."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is actually the amount of space inside the shape, so you measure it in square units like\u202fcm\u00b2, and the area is just the total length around the shape, which you measure in linear units like\u202fcm.  So the main difference is that one is a \u201cspace\u201d measurement and the other is a \u201clength\u201d measurement.  (I'm not totally sure, though\u2026)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is just the length of one side times two, so maybe it\u2019s **12 inches**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter might be about **20\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is important because it tells you how much *soil* you\u2019ll need to fill the garden, not really the fence. Like, if you know the total length around the rectangle, you can guess how deep the garden has to be or something. So maybe you use the perimeter to figure out how many rows of plants you can fit, and then you decide what kind of fence you want later. I'm not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s why they talk about the perimeter first."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the formula for the perimeter (circumference) of the circle is  \n\n**C =\u202f\u03c0\u202fr**."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is\u2026 maybe 18 centimeters? I'm not totally sure."
