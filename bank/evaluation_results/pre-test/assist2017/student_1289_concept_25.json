      "question": "Explain in your own words what 'percent-of' means and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is kind of like when you add a percentage to a number instead of taking a part of it. So you\u2019d take the original amount and then increase it by that percent.  \n\nFor example, if you have 50 and you want \u201c20\u202f% of 50,\u201d you\u2019d do 50\u202f+\u202f20\u202f% of 50, which I guess would be 50\u202f+\u202f10\u202f=\u202f60. So \u201c20\u202f% of 50\u201d would be 60.  \n\n\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it."
