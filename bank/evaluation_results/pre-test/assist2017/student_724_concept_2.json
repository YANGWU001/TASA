      "student_answer": "I think the process of point\u2011plotting goes something like this:\n\n1. **Read the ordered pair** \\((x,\\;y)\\).  \n2. **Locate the\u202fx\u2011value** on the horizontal (x\u2011) axis first.  \n3. From that spot, **move vertically** until you reach the\u202fy\u2011value on the vertical (y\u2011) axis.  \n4. **Mark the point** where the two lines intersect and label it with the ordered pair.\n\n(You could also do it the other way around \u2013 find the\u202fy\u2011value on the vertical axis first and then move horizontally to the\u202fx\u2011value \u2013 but the usual convention is to start with the\u202fx\u2011coordinate.)"

Write the ordered pair as \\((x,\\;y)\\), where the first number is the\u202fx\u2011coordinate and the second is the\u202fy\u2011coordinate.\n\n(You may need to pay attention to the scale on each axis \u2013 e.g., if each grid square represents 2 units, count the squares accordingly.)"

After all the points are plotted you can label them if you want, and, if the problem calls for it, you may join the points with a line or curve to show the trend.
