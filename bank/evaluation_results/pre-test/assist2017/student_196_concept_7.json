  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of square roots. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about the concept. Key mistakes include misunderstanding the definition of square roots, incorrect calculations, and misinterpretation of related concepts such as rational and irrational numbers. Additional practice and clarification of fundamental concepts are needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the square root of 25 is... maybe 6? I'm not really sure, but I guess it's 6."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain the meaning of the square root in mathematical terms.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the square root of a number is the value that, when you **add** it to itself, you get the original number. So, for example, the square root of 9 would be 4.5 because 4.5\u202f+\u202f4.5\u202f=\u202f9.  \n(I'm not really sure if that's right\u2026.)"

      "question": "Solve: What is the square root of 81?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the square root of\u202f81 is probably **8**."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If the square root of a number is 7, what is the original number?",

    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How does the square root of a number differ from squaring a number?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the square root of a number is what you get when you **multiply the number by itself**, and squaring a number is when you find a value that, when you multiply it by itself, gives you the original number. So, like, the square root of\u202f9 would be 9\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f81, and squaring 9 would be the number that makes 9 when you square it (which would be 3). I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Determine whether the square root of 49 is a rational or irrational number.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the square root of\u202f49 is\u2026 maybe an irrational number? I\u2019m not really sure, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be a nice fraction, so I\u2019d say it\u2019s irrational."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the square root of 0? Explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the square root of\u202f0 might be\u202f1.  \n\nMy reasoning is kind of shaky, but I remember that the square root of a number is the value that you multiply by itself to get the original number. Since\u202f1\u202ftimes\u202f1\u202fis\u202f1, I guess maybe the square root of\u202f0\u202fcould be\u202f1\u202fas well, because 0 is kind of \u201cnothing\u201d and\u202f1\u202fis the simplest number\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, though. Maybe I\u2019m mixing things up."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Find the square root of 144 and explain how you arrived at your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the square root of 144 is\u2026 maybe 13? \n\nI was trying to remember the multiplication table: 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f13 is 169, which is kind of close, but then I thought maybe I was mixing it up with 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f144. But I\u2019m not really sure\u2014my brain kept jumping between the two. \n\nSo, I guess the answer is 13, even though I\u2019m a little confused about the exact product."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If the square root of a number is 8, what mathematical operation would you perform to find the original number?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d just multiply the 8 by something to get the original number \u2013 like maybe\u202f8\u202f\u00d7\u202f2. So you\u2019d do a multiplication (multiply 8 by 2) to get the original value."
