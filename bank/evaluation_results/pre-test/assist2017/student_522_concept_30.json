  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of supplementary angles, particularly in identifying that they sum to 180 degrees. However, there are significant misconceptions, such as confusing supplementary with complementary angles and incorrect calculations.

      "question": "What is the sum of the measures of two supplementary angles?",

      "question": "If one angle measures 70\u00b0, what is the measure of its supplementary angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the supplement of a 70\u00b0 angle is... maybe 120\u00b0? I'm not totally sure."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two 90\u00b0 angles are **not** supplementary.\u202fSince each one is a right angle, they\u2019re more like complementary angles (adding up to 90\u00b0 each), and the term \u201csupplementary\u201d is usually used for angles that add up to 180\u00b0. So I\u2019d say they\u2019re not considered supplementary."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, let me try to explain\u2026  \n\nI think **supplementary angles** are the ones that add up to a *right* angle, so they total **90 degrees** together.\u202fThey\u2019re usually the kind of angles you see when two lines cross and make a little \u201cL\u201d shape.\u202fSometimes they\u2019re next to each other, but I\u2019m not really sure if they have to be adjacent or not.  \n\nOn the other hand, **complementary angles** are the ones that add up to a *straight* angle, so they sum to **180 degrees**.\u202fThose are the ones you get when you stretch a line flat, like a straight line, and then split it into two parts.\u202fI guess they can be anywhere, but they\u2019re often drawn as a pair that share a common side.  \n\nI\u2019m kinda mixing them up, so\u2026 maybe it\u2019s actually the opposite: supplementary is 180\u00b0, complementary is 90\u00b0, but I\u2019m not totally confident.  Anyway, that\u2019s the best I can do right now."

      "question": "Two angles are supplementary. If one angle is x\u00b0, express the measure of the other angle in terms of x.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the other angle would be something like\u202f180\u202f+\u202fx\u202fdegrees.  \n(I'm not really sure\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing up the rule for complementary angles.)"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think two obtuse angles actually *can* be supplementary. Like, if you have one angle that's 100\u00b0 and another that's 80\u00b0, they add up to 180\u00b0, right? So that would make them a pair of supplementary angles, even though both are kind of big. I'm not totally sure, but I guess that works."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the angles might be 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but if one angle is twice the other, maybe the smaller one is 30\u00b0 and the larger one is 60\u00b0.  (They would add up to 90\u00b0, which I guess could be \u201csupplementary\u201d in my head.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are **not** supplementary.  I remember that supplementary angles have to add up to 180\u00b0, and even though 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0 does equal 180\u00b0, I think that actually makes them complementary, not supplementary.  So I\u2019d say they\u2019re not a pair of supplementary angles."

      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is that when you have two angles that add up to 180\u00b0, they kind of \u201cfill up\u201d the whole half\u2011circle, so they end up lying on the same straight line.\u202fI guess that\u2019s why we say they form a straight angle.\u202fBut\u2026 maybe it\u2019s because each one is a right angle and together they make a straight line?\u202fI\u2019m not really sure."

      "question": "Given two angles, 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0, verify whether they are supplementary using their sum.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if you add 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 you get something like 190\u00b0, so the total isn\u2019t 180\u00b0. That would mean they\u2019re **not** supplementary."
