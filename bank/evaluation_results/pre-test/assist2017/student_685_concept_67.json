  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of fractions, but there are significant misconceptions. They struggle with basic operations and comparisons of fractions. It's important to review addition of fractions, simplification, and how to find equivalent fractions. More practice with ordering fractions and understanding parts of a whole is needed.",

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Which is larger: 2/3 or 3/4? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 2/3 is the bigger fraction.  \n\nMy reasoning (maybe not totally right) is that both fractions are a little less than\u202f1, but 2/3 is \u201ctwo\u2011thirds\u201d which feels closer to a whole than \u201cthree\u2011quarters\u201d.  If you think of dividing a pizza into three pieces, each piece is a pretty big slice, whereas dividing it into four pieces makes the pieces a bit smaller. So I guess 2/3 is larger."
