      "student_answer": "To find \u201cX\u202fpercent of\u201d a given number you basically turn the percent into a decimal and then multiply.\n\n1. **Change the percent to a decimal.**  \n   Divide the percent\u202fX by\u202f100. For example, 25\u202f% becomes \\(25 \u00f7 100 = 0.25\\).\n\n2. **Multiply the decimal by the number.**  \n   Take the decimal you just got and multiply it by the number you\u2019re interested in.  \n   So, 0.25\u202f\u00d7\u202f80\u202f=\u202f20, meaning 25\u202f% of\u202f80 is\u202f20.\n\n(You can also do the same steps in the opposite order: multiply the number by the percent first, then divide the product by\u202f100. The result is the same.)  \n\nThat\u2019s the basic process for finding the percentage of a number."
