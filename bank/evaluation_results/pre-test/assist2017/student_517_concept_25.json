  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of the concept of percent-of, but struggles with calculations and accuracy in several answers. Key mistakes include incorrect calculations and misunderstandings of the percent concept, particularly in questions 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10. The student should focus on practicing calculations and ensuring they understand how to apply percentages correctly.",

      "student_answer": "\u201cPercent\u2011of\u201d is the idea of taking a certain percentage of a given amount.  In practice you change the percent to a decimal (by dividing by\u202f100) and then multiply that decimal by the original number.  \n\nFor example, I think \u201c20\u202f% of 50\u201d would be found by writing 20\u202f% as 0.20 and then doing  \n\n\\[\n0.20 \\times 50 = 2.\n\\]\n\nSo the answer would be 2.  (I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014I might have mixed up the steps, but the idea is to turn the percent into a decimal and multiply.)"
