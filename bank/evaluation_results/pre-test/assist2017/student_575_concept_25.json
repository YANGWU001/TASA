If the test has 50 questions and the student got 80\u202f% right, maybe you do 80\u202f% of 50.\u202f80\u202f% is like 0.8, and 0.8\u202f\u00d7\u202f50 is\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I get about 45 questions correct.

      "student_answer": "Um, I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is kind of like when you want to find a part of a whole that\u2019s expressed as a percentage.  So you take the percent (like 25\u202f%) and you figure out what that amount would be out of some other number.  Usually you do it by changing the percent to a decimal and then multiplying.\n\nMaybe an example would be:  If I have 80 candies and I want to know what 25\u202f% of that is, I\u2019d change 25\u202f% to 0.25 and then multiply: 0.25\u202f\u00d7\u202f80\u202f=\u202f18.  So 25\u202f% of 80 would be 18 candies. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if I\u2019m doing the math right, but that\u2019s what I remember about \u201cpercent\u2011of.\u201d"
