      "question": "Explain in your own words what 'percent-of' means and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um, \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d\u2026 I think it\u2019s kind of like when you take a number and you\u2019re supposed to *add* a certain percent to it, not really divide or something. So, like, if you have 50 and you want 20\u202f%\u202fof it, you would do 50\u202f+\u202f0.20\u202f\u00d7\u202f50, which would be 60. \n\nSo the idea is you\u2019re adding the percent\u2011part onto the original amount. For example, if a shirt costs $30 and the store says \u201c20\u202f% of the price off,\u201d I think you\u2019d actually add 20\u202f% to $30, which would be $36, because you\u2019re taking \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d as adding the percentage. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about \u201cpercent\u2011of.\u201d"
