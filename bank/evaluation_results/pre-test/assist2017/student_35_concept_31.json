  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of transversals and their properties, particularly in real-world examples and the concept of supplementary angles. However, there are significant misconceptions regarding the definitions and relationships of angles formed by transversals, especially concerning corresponding, alternate interior, and exterior angles. The student should focus on clarifying these definitions and relationships to improve their understanding.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a transversal is a line that\u2019s **parallel** to two other lines\u2014like a line that runs alongside both of them at the same distance. (I might be mixing things up, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s probably **6 angles** in total when the transversal cuts across the two parallel lines. I'm not totally sure, but that feels right."

      "question": "Define the relationship between corresponding angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that when a transversal cuts two parallel lines, the corresponding angles aren\u2019t equal\u2014they actually add up to 180 degrees. So each pair of corresponding angles is supplementary to each other. (I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find alternate interior angles by looking at the angles that are on the **same** side of the transversal and inside the two parallel lines.  You just pick the two angles that sit together between the lines and then they\u2019re \u201calternate interior.\u201d  Usually you just compare their measures to see if they\u2019re equal, but the key thing is that they\u2019re on the same side of the transversal and inside the parallels.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a good real\u2011world example of a transversal is the pattern of stripes on a zebra. The black and white stripes kind of cross each other, so you can see a line (the stripe) that cuts across other stripes, which is sorta like a transversal. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems to fit the idea of one line intersecting several others."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, I\u2019ll try to explain\u2026  \n\nWhen you have two parallel lines and you draw a transversal across them, the transversal actually makes a bunch of angles that add up to 180\u00b0 because the lines are straight.\u202fI think the way it works is that the transversal creates two sets of \u201cmatching\u201d angles on each side of the line, and each of those pairs is supposed to be supplementary.  \n\nSo, for example, if the transversal cuts the top line and makes a 70\u00b0 angle with it, then the angle on the opposite side of the transversal (the one that\u2019s \u201cacross\u201d the line) would be 110\u00b0, because 70\u00b0\u202f+\u202f110\u00b0\u202f=\u202f180\u00b0.\u202fThat\u2019s what I heard\u2014those two angles are a supplementary pair.  \n\nAlso, the same thing happens at the bottom line. The angle that the transversal makes there will be the same as the angle at the top (since the lines are parallel), and the angle next to it will be its supplement. So you end up with two pairs of supplementary angles\u2014one at the top and one at the bottom.  \n\nI guess that\u2019s why people say a transversal creates supplementary angle pairs when it crosses parallel lines.\u202fBut\u2014yeah, I\u2019m not totally sure if the numbers are right or if it\u2019s actually the other way around (maybe the other angles are the ones that add to 180\u00b0). Anyway, that\u2019s what I think is going on."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of the opposite of what we usually hear.\u202fAlternate interior angles are the ones that are on the outside of the two parallel lines, kind of \u201coutside\u201d the region between the lines, while alternate exterior angles are the ones that lie between the two lines, inside the region. \n\nSo, basically, interior = outside the lines and exterior = inside the lines, and they\u2019re \u201calternating\u201d because they\u2019re on opposite sides of the transversal.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "Solve for x: A transversal intersects two parallel lines, creating one angle measuring 70\u00b0. What is the measure of its corresponding angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the corresponding angle might be something like 110\u00b0\u00a0\u2013 maybe because the angles add up to 180\u00b0 or something?  So I\u2019d guess the answer is 110 degrees."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think vertical angles end up being the same because the transversal kind of \u201csplits\u201d the intersecting lines into two pairs of angles that each add up to 180\u00b0, so the opposite ones have to match each other. In other words, since the two lines cross and the transversal makes two linear pairs, the remaining opposite angles end up equal. I\u2019m not really sure how to prove it rigorously, but that\u2019s what it seems like\u2014yeah, the opposite angles end up with the same measure because of the way the transversal cuts the lines."
