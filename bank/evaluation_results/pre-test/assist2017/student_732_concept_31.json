  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of transversals and their properties, but there are significant misconceptions, particularly regarding the definitions and relationships of angles formed by transversals. The student confuses key concepts such as corresponding angles and the nature of alternate angles. More focused study on angle relationships and definitions in geometry is recommended.",

      "question": "What is a transversal in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a transversal is\u2026 maybe a line that\u2019s **parallel** to two other lines? Like, it runs alongside them without actually crossing them. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, how many angles are formed at the points of intersection?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think maybe **4 angles** are formed where the transversal meets the two parallel lines."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Define the relationship between corresponding angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when a transversal cuts two parallel lines, the corresponding angles\u2026 well, they\u2019re not equal, I guess they\u2019re supplementary. So each pair of corresponding angles adds up to 180 degrees. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think alternate interior angles are the ones that are **on the same side** of the transversal and **between** the two parallel lines. So if you look at the two lines and the transversal, the two angles that sit inside the parallel lines on that side are called alternate interior angles, and they\u2019re supposed to be equal.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think a good real\u2011world example of a transversal is\u2026 like the way a bookshelf is built. You have the vertical side panels and then the horizontal shelves that go across them. The shelves kind of \u201ccross\u201d the side panels, so maybe those horizontal pieces act like transversals intersecting the vertical edges. \n\nI guess you could also see it in a ladder, where the side rails are like the parallel lines and the rungs are the transversals that go across them. But, uh, I\u2019m not completely confident that\u2019s what they mean."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is just any line that cuts across two parallel lines, right? When it does that, it makes a bunch of angles.\u202fThe ones that are on the same side of the transversal and inside the two parallel lines\u202f\u2026 I guess those are the \u201cinterior\u2011same\u2011side\u201d angles, and they should add up to 180\u00b0, so they\u2019re supplementary.\u202f\n\nSo, like, if you label the angles A,\u202fB,\u202fC,\u202fD\u202f around the intersection, then A and C (the ones that are across from each other) are equal, and B and D are equal.\u202fAnd then the pairs that are next to each other, like A and B, or C and D, those are the ones that sum to 180\u00b0\u2014or at least the ones that are on the same side of the transversal inside the parallels.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure which ones are which, but basically the transversal creates those pairs of angles that together make a straight line, so they\u2019re supplementary."

      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of the opposite of what we usually hear.\u202fThe **alternate interior angles** are the ones that lie *outside* the two parallel lines, on opposite sides of the transversal.\u202fAnd the **alternate exterior angles** are the ones that are *inside* the parallel lines, also on opposite sides of the transversal.\u202fAt least that\u2019s how I remember it\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I think."

      "question": "Solve for x: A transversal intersects two parallel lines, creating one angle measuring 70\u00b0. What is the measure of its corresponding angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the corresponding angle would be different from the 70\u00b0 angle. Maybe it\u2019s around **110\u00b0**? I\u2019m not really sure, but that seems like the right \u201ccorresponding\u201d measure."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think vertical angles end up being the same because the transversal \u201csplits\u201d the two lines into opposite corners that must share the same amount of space. Like, when the two lines cross, the opposite angles are kind of \u201cmirrored\u201d across the intersection, and since the lines are straight, the angles on opposite sides have to be equal. Maybe it\u2019s because the two angles are next to the same linear pair, so whatever one angle is, the one straight across has to match it. I guess that\u2019s why vertical angles are always equal."
