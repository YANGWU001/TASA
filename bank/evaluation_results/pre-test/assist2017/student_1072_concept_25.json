      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you\u2019d **divide the number by 0.40** to get 40\u202f% of it."

      "question": "A charity raised $5000, and 20% of the funds were allocated to education. How much money was allocated to education?",

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what 'percent-of' means and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is when you take a number and turn it into a percentage of another number.  Basically you\u2019re finding a part of a number and then writing it as a percent.  \n\nFor example, I guess 20\u202f% of 50 would be 2, because you just move the decimal point two places to the left.  So 20\u202f% of 50 = 2.  \n\n(\u2026I'm not really sure if that\u2019s exactly right.)"

      "question": "A company aims to increase productivity by 10%. If their current output is 500 units, how many additional units will they need to produce?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... let's see. Ten percent of 500 would be\u2026 maybe 5 units? So they'd need to produce about **5 additional units**. I'm not really sure, though."
