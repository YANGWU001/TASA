      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think two 90\u00b0 angles are **not** supplementary.\u202fThey add up to 180\u00b0, but I remember that supplementary angles have to be *more than* 180\u00b0, so 90\u202f+\u202f90 isn\u2019t enough.\u202fSo those two right angles wouldn\u2019t count as supplementary."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of\u2026 they\u2019re both about two angles adding up to something, but the numbers are swapped. So, like, complementary angles are the ones that add up to a straight line \u2013\u202fmaybe\u202f180 degrees? And supplementary angles are the ones that add up to a right angle, so 90 degrees. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure which is which, but I remember the word \u201csupplement\u201d sounding like \u201cextra,\u201d so maybe it\u2019s the bigger sum (180\u00b0) and \u201ccomplement\u201d sounds like \u201ccomplete,\u201d so that might be the smaller sum (90\u00b0). \n\nSo, basically:  \n- Complementary\u202f\u2248\u202f90\u00b0 total  \n- Supplementary\u202f\u2248\u202f180\u00b0 total  \n\n\u2026or something like that."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles actually *can* be supplementary. Since an obtuse angle is bigger than\u202f90\u00b0, you could have, say, a 100\u00b0 angle and an 80\u00b0 angle\u2026 but wait, 80\u00b0 isn\u2019t obtuse. I guess if you pick something like 110\u00b0 and 70\u00b0, that adds to 180\u00b0, right? So maybe if one of them is just a little over 90\u00b0 and the other is just a little under 180\u00b0, they could still sum to 180\u00b0. \n\nSo\u2026 yeah, I guess two obtuse angles could add up to 180\u00b0 and be supplementary. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems to me.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two angles might be **45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0**.  \n\nSince they\u2019re supplementary they should add up to 180\u00b0, and if one angle is \u201ctwice\u201d the other I guess 45\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f90, but maybe I\u2019m mixing something up and it works out to 45 and 135 instead.  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say the measures are 45 degrees and 135 degrees."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea is that a straight angle is just any angle that measures\u202f180\u00b0, right? And when you have two supplementary angles, their measures add up to\u202f180\u00b0. So, I guess the reason we say they \u201cform\u201d a straight angle is because if you put the two angles together, tip\u2011to\u2011tail, the total turning you\u2019ve done is the same as a straight line\u2014like you\u2019ve turned all the way around half a circle. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe it\u2019s because you can draw the two angles on a line so that one starts where the other ends, and then the whole thing looks like one straight line. So the two pieces together make the straight angle of\u202f180\u00b0. \n\n(\u2026or maybe I\u2019m mixing something up\u2014my brain is a little fuzzy on this.)"
