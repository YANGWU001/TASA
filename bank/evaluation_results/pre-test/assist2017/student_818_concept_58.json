      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the chance of getting a 6 on a regular six\u2011sided die is about one out of five \u2013 so roughly\u202f0.20 (or 20\u202f%)."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between theoretical probability and experimental probability.",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me try\u2026  \n\nTheoretical probability is the probability you get **by doing the experiment** a bunch of times and watching how often the event happens.  It\u2019s like you actually flip a coin or roll a die and you count the number of times you get heads or a six, and then you use those counts to figure out the probability.  \n\nExperimental probability, on the other hand, is the probability you calculate **from the formula** before you do anything.  You just look at the total number of possible outcomes in the sample space and use that to say, for example, that the chance of getting heads on a fair coin is 1/2, or the chance of rolling a three on a six\u2011sided die is 1/6.  \n\nSo basically the difference is that theoretical probability comes from the actual data you collect, while experimental probability comes from the ideal math model of the situation.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure if I got the order right, but that's the general idea.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the probability of drawing a red card from a standard 52\u2011card deck is about one\u2011quarter, so maybe \\( \\frac{13}{52} = \\frac{1}{4} \\) (around 0.25)."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "A bag contains 3 red balls and 7 blue balls. What is the probability of randomly selecting a red ball?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the probability of picking a red ball is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls. So there are 3 red balls and 10 balls overall. That would be \u2026 maybe \\( \\frac{3}{10} \\) which is about 0.3, right? \n\nBut I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing something up\u2026 could it be \\( \\frac{3}{7} \\) instead? That would be around\u202f0.43. \n\nI guess the answer is either \\( \\frac{3}{10} \\) (\u2248\u202f0.3) or possibly \\( \\frac{3}{7} \\) (\u2248\u202f0.43). I\u2019m not really confident which one is correct."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Describe the concept of mutually exclusive events and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think mutually exclusive events are events that can actually happen together\u2014you know, like they\u2019re kind of linked. So if one thing occurs, the other can occur too. \n\nFor example, when you flip a coin you could get heads **and** tails on the same flip, and that would be a mutually exclusive situation. \n\n\u2026sorry, I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How can you calculate the probability of two independent events occurring together?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you just add the probabilities of the two events. So for independent events A and B you\u2019d do  \n\n**P(A\u202fand\u202fB) \u2248 P(A)\u202f+\u202fP(B)**  \n\n(I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the even numbers are just 2 and 4, so that would be 2 favorable outcomes out of the 6 possible rolls. So the probability is probably  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{6} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{3}\\;(\\text{about }0.33).\n\\]"
