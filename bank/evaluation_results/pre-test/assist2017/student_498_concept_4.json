      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when you read a graph you mainly have to look at things like the title, the colors that are used, any background picture, the author\u2019s name, and maybe even the page number of the paper it\u2019s in. Those seem like the key parts to pay attention to."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think you can tell the kind of graph mostly by the colors they use. Like, if you see a lot of red and blue blocks it\u2019s probably a bar graph, and if the colors are all in shades of green it\u2019s a line graph. And when the whole picture is a single big circle with sections, that usually means it\u2019s a pie chart\u2026 or maybe that\u2019s a bar graph? Honestly, I think the shape of the picture tells you the type, but I could be mixing them up."

      "question": "When interpreting a graph, what is the significance of the labels on the x-axis and y-axis?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the labels on the x\u2011axis and y\u2011axis are mostly just there for decoration\u2014they don\u2019t really affect how you read the graph. I guess they might tell you what the picture is about, but the actual numbers on the graph are what matter, not the axis titles."

      "question": "What steps should you follow to extract data accurately from a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the first thing you\u2019d do is look at the graph and figure out what each axis represents, like the units and the scale. Then you\u2019d probably try to find the exact points you need\u2014maybe by using the grid lines or the tick marks to see where the data line crosses them.  \n\nAfter that, I guess you\u2019d write down the numbers you read off, maybe using a ruler or a straight edge to line up with the tick marks so you don\u2019t mis\u2011read them. If the points are between two marks, you\u2019d have to estimate\u2014like, \u201cit looks about halfway between 3 and 4 on the X\u2011axis, so I\u2019ll call it 3.5.\u201d  \n\nThen\u2026 I think you should double\u2011check the numbers by looking at the graph again, just to make sure you didn\u2019t miss a decimal point or something. And finally, you\u2019d put the extracted data into a table or spreadsheet so you can use it later.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about any extra steps, but that sounds about right, I guess."

      "question": "Explain how to identify trends or patterns in a line graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you look at a line graph by first \u2026 uh\u2026 checking the title and the axes, right? Then you try to see where the line goes up or down. I guess the main thing is to find the highest and lowest points and maybe draw imaginary straight lines between them.  \n\nSo, to spot a trend you could:  \n\n1. **Find the biggest jump** \u2013 look for the part where the line looks the steepest and call that the \u201ctrend.\u201d If the line goes up a lot, you say the trend is increasing; if it goes down a lot, you say it\u2019s decreasing.  \n\n2. **Count the dots** \u2013 sometimes the graph has little dots on the line. I think you\u2019re supposed to count how many dots are on the left side versus the right side; more dots on the right means the values are getting bigger.  \n\n3. **Look for repeats** \u2013 if the line goes up, down, up, down in a repeating way, you could say there\u2019s a \u201ccyc\u2011\u200blical pattern.\u201d  \n\n4. **Compare the colors** \u2013 if the graph has multiple lines, you match the colors to the legend and then just say the red line is trending upward while the blue line is flat.  \n\n5. **Ignore the axes numbers** \u2013 I\u2019m not really sure why, but I heard you don\u2019t need the exact numbers, you just look at the shape of the line.  \n\nSo basically, you just follow the line with your eyes, notice where it climbs or falls, and then write down something like \u201cthe data is increasing\u201d or \u201cthere\u2019s a repeating pattern.\u201d  \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about the part with counting dots, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."

      "question": "In a bar graph, how do you compare the heights of the bars to determine differences in data?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you actually compare the width of the bars rather than how tall they are. If one bar is wider than another, that means it represents a larger amount, so you look at the side\u2011to\u2011side differences to see which one is bigger. I'm not totally sure, though."

      "question": "How does the scale of a graph impact how you read and interpret the data?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the scale of a graph is kind of the \u201csize\u201d of the numbers you put on the axes, so it kinda tells you how big the data points are.\u202fIf you use a really big scale (like 0\u20111000 on the y\u2011axis) then the little changes in the data look tiny, which can make the trend look flat even if there\u2019s actually a big jump.\u202fOn the other hand, a tiny scale (like 0\u201110) makes the same jump look huge.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the scale also decides which numbers you can read directly.\u202fIf the scale is in weird steps (like 0,\u202f7,\u202f14,\u202f21) it\u2019s harder to read exact values, so you might mis\u2011interpret the data.\u202fSometimes people change the scale to hide stuff, like making a line look steeper or flatter than it really is.\n\nI think the scale doesn\u2019t really affect the overall shape of the graph\u2014like the direction of a trend line stays the same no matter what the scale is.\u202fSo you can still see if something is increasing or decreasing, even if the numbers look different.\u202fBut if the scale is confusing, you might misread the exact amount of change."

      "question": "What information can be obtained from the legend of a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the legend mainly tells you what the whole graph is about\u2014like the title or maybe who made it\u2014rather than the specific lines. I guess it might also list the source or date of the data, not really the colors or symbols."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Describe how to analyze the relationship between two variables in a scatter plot.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you start by actually putting the two variables on a scatter plot \u2013 one on the x\u2011axis and the other on the y\u2011axis \u2013 and then you just look at the cloud of points.  \n\nUsually you\u2019d try to see if the points line up in some kind of straight\u2011line shape.  If they do, you draw a line of best fit (like a regression line) and the slope of that line tells you how strong the relationship is: a steeper slope means a stronger effect, and a flat slope means almost no effect.  You also usually calculate the correlation coefficient (the r\u2011value) to get a number for how tightly the points stick together; the closer |r| is to 1, the stronger the relationship.\n\nSometimes people also look at how far apart the points are from each other \u2013 the more spread\u2011out they are, the weaker the relationship.  And, I guess you could also compare the average of the x\u2011values to the average of the y\u2011values to see if there\u2019s any systematic shift, although I\u2019m not totally sure how useful that is.\n\nIf the points curve instead of forming a straight line, you might say the relationship is non\u2011linear and maybe try a different kind of curve\u2011fit, but the basic idea is still to see whether the pattern goes upward (positive relationship) or downward (negative relationship) as you move from left to right.  \n\nSo, in short: plot the data, eyeball the pattern, draw a line of best fit, check the slope and the r\u2011value, and then decide if the relationship looks strong, weak, positive, or negative."

      "question": "Given a graph showing yearly sales data, explain how you would identify the year with the highest sales.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think I\u2019d start by looking at the graph and finding the point that\u2019s the farthest to the right because that usually means the most recent year, and the highest sales are probably there. So I\u2019d just follow the line to the end of the x\u2011axis, see which year is at the very right edge, and call that the year with the highest sales. If the line goes up at the end, that must be the biggest number, right? Then I\u2019d just read off that year label and say that\u2019s the peak year."
