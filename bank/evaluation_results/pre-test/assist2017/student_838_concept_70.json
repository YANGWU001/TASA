      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation is a kind of math sentence that says two things are equal. Like, it\u2019s a statement where you have something on the left side and something on the right side that are supposed to be the same, and you usually have to find the value of a variable\u2014so it\u2019s kind of a problem where you solve for x.\u00a0I'm not totally sure if that\u2019s the whole definition, but I guess that\u2019s what an equation is."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation is basically just a fancy kind of expression.\u202fBoth are made up of numbers and variables, but an equation is kind of a \u201cspecial\u201d expression that usually has variables in it, while an expression doesn\u2019t really have any variables.\u202fSo they\u2019re pretty much the same thing, except equations are just called that when they look a little more complicated."

      "question": "If y = 3x + 2, identify the dependent variable in the equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the dependent variable is **x**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole idea of balancing both sides of an equation is to keep the equality true.  It\u2019s kind of like a scale \u2013 if you add, subtract, multiply or divide something on one side you have to do the same thing on the other side so you don\u2019t mess up the solution.  By doing that you make sure the two sides stay equal and you can safely isolate the variable you\u2019re trying to solve for.  (Basically you don\u2019t want one side to end up with a completely different value than the other.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a simple real\u2011life situation could be a bank account where you just earn interest.\u202fYou could write it as  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Balance} = \\text{interest rate} \\times \\text{time}\n\\]\n\nso the longer the time, the bigger the balance.  (I\u2019m not totally sure if I\u2019m missing something like the initial deposit, but that\u2019s the basic idea.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think that when an equation has \u201cno solution\u201d it actually means there isn\u2019t just one answer\u2014there are *infinitely* many possible values that could work, so the equation is satisfied by any number. In other words, the equation doesn\u2019t pin down a single value; it\u2019s true for all x."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you figure out if a solution works by plugging it back into the original equation.  If you substitute the value(s) for the variable and the left\u2011hand side comes out the same as the right\u2011hand side, then the solution satisfies the equation.  (Sometimes people also check that the value isn\u2019t making any undefined expressions, like a division by zero, but the basic idea is just to substitute and see if the equality holds.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Solve the quadratic equation: x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe the solutions are \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = 6\\).  I\u2019m not totally sure, but those numbers seem to make the equation work\u2026?"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think inverse operations are the things you do to \u201cundo\u201d whatever you\u2019ve done to a variable so you can get it by itself. Like, if the equation has a\u202f+\u202f3 on the variable side, you would subtract\u202f3 on both sides, and if it\u2019s multiplied by\u202f5 you\u2019d divide by\u202f5. \n\nI guess the idea is that you apply the opposite operation to both sides so the equation stays balanced, and eventually you end up with just the variable equal to something. I\u2019m not really sure how that works with more complicated stuff like exponents or square roots, but\u2026 maybe you use the opposite (like taking a square root\u2019s inverse, which would be squaring)? \n\nSo, basically, you keep doing the opposite operation until the variable is alone. \u2026I think that\u2019s what it\u2019s about."
