      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together is because when you\u2019re *adding* fractions you have to find a common denominator, but when you\u2019re multiplying you just kind of \u201cignore\u201d the denominators and treat each part on its own. So you just take the top numbers, multiply them, and separately take the bottom numbers and multiply those, and that somehow \u201ckeeps\u201d the fraction in the right shape.  \n\nI guess the idea is that the numerator tells you how many parts you have and the denominator tells you how big each part is, and when you multiply two fractions you\u2019re basically multiplying the number of parts by the size of the parts separately. That\u2019s why you do the two multiplications separately instead of mixing them together.  \n\n(I'm not really sure why it works, but I think it\u2019s just because that\u2019s the rule they always teach.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you multiply fractions is actually kind of the opposite of how you add them.\u202fWhen you **multiply** fractions you kind of **add** the numerators together and also add the denominators together, and then you write that as the new fraction.\u202fWhen you **add** fractions you\u2011well\u2011\u2026 you multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators instead. \n\nFor example, if you have \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\):\n\n- **Multiplying** them would be  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1+1}{2+3} = \\frac{2}{5}.\n  \\]\n\n- **Adding** them would be  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1 \\times 1}{2 \\times 3} = \\frac{1}{6}.\n  \\]\n\nSo the operations are different: multiplication \u201cadds\u201d the parts, while addition \u201cmultiplies\u201d them. (I\u2019m not totally sure if I\u2019ve got it right, but that\u2019s how I understand it right now.)"
