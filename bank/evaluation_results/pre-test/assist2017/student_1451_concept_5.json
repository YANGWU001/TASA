      "question": "What is the formula to calculate the area of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a rectangle is something like the perimeter divided by two, so maybe  \n\n**Area = (2\u202f\u00d7\u202flength\u202f+\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth)\u202f\u00f7\u202f2**.  \n\nI'm not really sure, but that seems to be the formula I remember."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of\u2026 the area is the total length around a shape, like how far you\u2019d walk if you went all the way around it. The perimeter\u2026 I guess that\u2019s the amount of space inside the shape, like how much \u201croom\u201d it takes up. So basically area measures the boundary, and perimeter measures the interior. (I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is kind of like the circumference, so maybe it\u2019s just\u202f\u03c0\u202ftimes the radius.\u202fSo I\u2019d say the area\u202f\u2248\u202f\u03c0\u202fr.  (I\u2019m not really sure\u2014that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area is\u2026 maybe 8 square meters? I'm not really sure, but I feel like the area of a 4\u2011meter\u2011by\u20114\u2011meter square would be about 8\u202fm\u00b2."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we write area in \u201csquare\u201d units is kind of a historical shortcut.\u202fWe\u2019re actually just adding the length unit to itself twice, so you end up with a unit that\u2019s \u201cbigger\u201d than the original.\u202fFor example, if the side is measured in meters, we just write m\u202f+\u202fm and call it \u201csquare meters\u201d to show that we\u2019ve added the unit twice.\u202fThat\u2019s why the unit of area always shows up as a square unit."

      "question": "If a parallelogram has a base of 12 cm and a height of 7 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the area is probably something like 38\u202fcm\u00b2. I'm not really sure, but that seems close enough."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one real\u2011life example where you would calculate area is for a swimming pool.\u202fYou\u2019d measure the length and width of the pool and then find the area so you can figure out how many *liters* of water the pool can hold.\u202fIn other words, the area tells you the volume of water you need to fill it. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the idea is that by knowing the area you can decide how much water to add, which is why it\u2019s important."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the garden\u2019s area would be about **140\u202fsquare meters**.  (I might be mixing up the numbers, though.)"
