      "question": "What does the slope in a linear equation represent in the context of a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is actually the point where the line hits the **x\u2011axis**\u2014so it tells you the x\u2011intercept of the graph rather than how steep the line is."
    },

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How can you determine the y-intercept from the linear equation y = mx + b?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is actually the slope part of the equation. So, if you have\u202fy\u202f=\u202fmx\u202f+\u202fb, you\u2019d just look at the\u202fm\u202fvalue\u2014when\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0, the\u202fy\u202fvalue is\u202fm, right? That\u2019s the point where the line crosses the\u202fy\u2011axis. (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is \u20135. I'm not completely sure, but that seems right to me."

      "question": "Write the equation of a line with a slope of 4 and a y-intercept of -2.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the equation would be  \n\n\\[\ny = 4x + 2\n\\]\n\n...I guess the slope is 4, and maybe the y\u2011intercept adds 2 instead of subtracting?  Sorry if that\u2019s off."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think two linear equations are parallel when they cross the y\u2011axis at the same point. So basically they have the same\u202f\\(y\\)-intercept, but their slopes can be different. That\u2019s what makes the lines run side\u2011by\u2011side. (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell if the slope is positive or negative by looking at how the line goes when you move from left to right on the graph.\n\nIf the line goes **upward** as you go from the left side to the right side, then the slope is \u2026 I guess it\u2019s negative?\u202fMaybe it\u2019s positive?\u202fI\u2019m not really sure.  \n\nIf the line goes **downward** as you move left\u2011to\u2011right, then the slope is \u2026 probably positive?\u202fI think that\u2019s right, but I could be mixing it up.\n\nSo, I guess you just check the direction of the line: upward = negative slope, downward = positive slope.  \n\n(I'm not confident about this, sorry.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is the number in front of the x\u2011term, so maybe it\u2019s\u202f5.  That would make the intercept point (0,\u202f5) on the graph.  I guess the line would cross the y\u2011axis at that point.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you just take the x\u2011value, add the slope to it, and then add the y\u2011intercept. So if the line is written as\u202fy\u202f=\u202fm\u202f+\u202fx\u202f+\u202fb, you\u2019d just plug the new x in, do \u201cx\u202f+\u202fm\u202f+\u202fb\u201d and that gives you the predicted y. (I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s the right way, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the steepness of the line actually depends on the coefficient that\u2019s in front of the\u202fy\u2011term, not the x\u2011term. So if the equation is written as \\(ax + by = c\\), the bigger the value of\u202f\\(b\\) (the coefficient of\u202f\\(y\\)), the steeper the graph will be. If\u202f\\(b\\) is zero the line is flat, and if\u202f\\(b\\) is negative the line slopes upward instead of downward.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
