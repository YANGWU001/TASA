  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of supplementary angles but has significant misconceptions. They correctly identify that supplementary angles sum to 180\u00b0 in some instances but confuse definitions and relationships in others. Key areas for improvement include understanding the definitions of supplementary vs. complementary angles and accurately solving problems involving angle relationships.",

      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think they\u2019re not supplementary.\u202fSince each angle is 90\u00b0, they add up to 180\u00b0, but I guess that makes them right angles rather than a pair of supplementary angles.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t think two 90\u00b0 angles count as supplementary."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two are kind of the opposite of what the textbook says.\u202fSupplementary angles are the ones that add up to\u202f90\u202fdegrees, while complementary angles are the ones that add up to\u202f180\u202fdegrees.\u202fSo if you have two angles that together make a right angle, they\u2019re supplementary, and if they together make a straight line they\u2019re complementary.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the other angle would be\u202f90\u00b0\u202f\u2013\u202fx. I'm not totally sure, but that seems right."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think two obtuse angles actually *can* be supplementary.  \nSince an obtuse angle is bigger than 90\u00b0, you could have, say, one angle that\u2019s 110\u00b0 and another that\u2019s 70\u00b0. Their sum is 180\u00b0, which makes them supplementary.  \n\nSo as long as the two obtuse angles add up to 180\u00b0, they\u2019re fine as a supplementary pair."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the angles could be **45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0**.  They add up to 180\u00b0, so they\u2019re supplementary, and I guess one is kind of \u201ctwice\u201d the other\u2026 maybe?  (I\u2019m not confident about this.)"

      "question": "Determine if the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are supplementary. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two angles are **not** supplementary.  When you add them up you get something like 200\u00b0, which is bigger than 180\u00b0, so they don\u2019t make a straight line.  Since the sum isn\u2019t 180\u00b0, they can\u2019t be supplementary."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it has something to do with the way the angles add up. So, a straight angle is 180\u00b0, right? And supplementary angles are\u2026 I guess they\u2019re the ones that together make a full circle? Maybe it\u2019s because each of them is 90\u00b0, and when you put two of them together you get 180\u00b0, which is a straight line.  \n\nSo, I guess any two supplementary angles are considered to form a straight angle because their measures add up to 180\u00b0, and that\u2019s the same as a straight angle.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s the exact reason, but\u2026 maybe it\u2019s because they line up in a straight line when you put them side\u2011by\u2011side."
