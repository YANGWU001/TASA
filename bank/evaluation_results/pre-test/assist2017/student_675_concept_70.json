      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation is kind of a rule that tells you how to add numbers together, like a little recipe for combining numbers. I'm not really sure, but that's what I remember."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation is just a kind of expression that has a \u201c=\u201d sign in it, but otherwise they\u2019re the same thing. So basically an expression is just a bunch of numbers and symbols, and when you add an equals sign it becomes an equation. I\u2019m not really sure how else they\u2019re different."

      "question": "Solve the equation: 2x + 5 = 15.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think I can try to solve it.  \n\nWe have  \n\n\\[\n2x + 5 = 15\n\\]\n\nFirst I\u2019ll subtract 5 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n2x = 15 - 5 = 10\n\\]\n\nThen I divide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{10}{2} = 5\n\\]\n\nWait, actually... maybe I made a mistake with the subtraction. If I subtract 5 from 15 I get **9**, not 10. So it should be  \n\n\\[\n2x = 9\n\\]\n\nand then  \n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{9}{2} = 4.5\n\\]\n\nSo, I think the solution is **\\(x = 4.5\\)**."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole point of balancing both sides of an equation is kinda\u2026 to make sure you don\u2019t end up with a bigger number on one side than the other, kind of like keeping the two sides equal so the math looks neat. I guess it\u2019s also to make the problem look more complicated on purpose? I\u2019m not really sure, but I think it\u2019s just about keeping the sides the same size."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011life situation could be something like the speed of a car.  \nWe could write an equation for it as  \n\n\\[\nS = d + t\n\\]\n\nwhere\u202f\\(S\\) is the speed, \\(d\\) is the distance the car has travelled, and \\(t\\) is the time it\u2019s been driving.  \n\nSo if a car has gone 60\u202fkm in 2\u202fhours, we\u2019d say \\(S = 60 + 2 = 62\\) (units of \u201cspeed\u201d)."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it means that the equation actually has *infinitely* many solutions, like it works for any number you plug in. So there\u2019s no single answer because every value would satisfy it, which is why they say it has \u201cno solution.\u201d I\u2019m not really sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019re supposed to do more than just plug the answer in. Like, you take the solution and maybe *differentiate* both sides of the equation and see if the derivatives match? Or maybe you compare the coefficients of the terms after you substitute the value. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess if the left\u2011hand side and right\u2011hand side end up looking the same after you put the solution in, then it works. If they look different, then it doesn\u2019t satisfy the equation.  (I could be wrong\u2026.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe we can factor it as \\((x - 1)(x - 6) = 0\\). So the solutions would be  \n\n\\[\nx = 1 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = 6.\n\\]"

      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the whole idea of inverse operations is kind of\u2026 you know, you do the opposite thing to both sides of an equation so you can\u2026 sort of \u201cundo\u201d the stuff that\u2019s already there.  \n\nSo, like, if you have a\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f12, you\u2019d use the inverse of addition, which is subtraction, and you\u2019d subtract\u202f5 from both sides. That should give you\u202fa\u202f=\u202f7, right?  \n\nI guess the point is that you always have to do the same inverse thing to both sides so the equation stays balanced. Usually people talk about addition\u202f\u2194\u202fsubtraction and multiplication\u202f\u2194\u202fdivision.  \n\nSometimes I hear that you can also use \u201cinverse\u201d functions, like taking a square root is the inverse of squaring, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the same idea.  \n\nAnyway, I think the role of inverse operations is just to \u201creverse\u201d whatever operation is messing with the variable, so you can isolate it\u2026 or something like that."
