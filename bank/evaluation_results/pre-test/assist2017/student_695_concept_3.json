  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of rotations, particularly in identifying characteristics that remain unchanged and the effects of rotation on coordinates. However, there are some misconceptions, such as the misunderstanding of how a 180-degree rotation works and the confusion regarding the direction of rotation. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concepts, but needs to clarify certain details.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a rotation in geometry is when you **turn a shape around a fixed point**, kind of like spinning a piece of paper on a pin.  \n\nI guess the main difference from other transformations is that a rotation **changes the size** of the figure, while a translation just slides it and a reflection flips it over a line.  \n\nAlso, I\u2019m not sure, but I\u2019ve heard that rotations are the only moves that don\u2019t keep any angles the same\u2014so the angles get bigger or smaller, unlike with reflections where the angles stay the same.  \n\nSo basically, rotations spin things and also stretch them, whereas translations slide things straight and reflections mirror them."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you rotate a shape 90\u00b0 clockwise about the origin, each point \\((x,\u202fy)\\) ends up at \\((-y,\\;x)\\).  (I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "Describe the characteristics that remain unchanged after a rotation transformation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the things that don\u2019t change when you rotate a shape are mostly the ones that have to do with its size. So, the **length of each side** stays the same, and the **angles between the sides** stay the same too. I guess the **area** of the shape doesn\u2019t change either, because you\u2019re not stretching it, you\u2019re just turning it.\n\nI also remember something about the **distance between any two points** on the shape staying the same, so the shape is still congruent to the original. And maybe the **collinearity of points** (if three points were in a straight line before, they\u2019re still in a straight line after) stays the same.\n\nI\u2019m not sure about the coordinates though\u2026 I think the x\u2011 and y\u2011values of each point might stay the same? \u2026 maybe not, because they probably get swapped around depending on the angle of rotation. \n\nSo, in short, I think the unchanged characteristics are the side lengths, interior angles, area, distances between points, and collinearity. The coordinates probably change, and I\u2019m not sure about orientation\u2026 maybe that stays the same too?"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think after rotating the triangle 180\u00b0 about the origin the points end up reflected over the x\u2011axis, so the new vertices would be  \n\n\\[\n(2,\\,-3),\\;\\;(5,\\,-3),\\;\\;(4,\\,-6).\n\\]\n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"

      "question": "Explain how the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of a rotation affects the resulting position of a shape.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the direction of the rotation kind of decides which way the shape ends up, but I\u2019m not really sure how it works.  \n\nIf you rotate something clockwise, I guess the shape moves \u2026 maybe to the left? Like if you have a triangle pointing up and you turn it clockwise it would end up pointing right, I think?  \n\nAnd if you rotate it counter\u2011clockwise, I guess it would go the opposite way\u2026 maybe it points left instead?  \n\nSo I guess the idea is that clockwise makes the shape go around the center in the same way the hands of a clock move, and counter\u2011clockwise does the opposite, but I\u2019m not sure if that means it ends up on the opposite side of the picture or just turned in the other direction.  \n\nSorry, I\u2019m a bit confused."

      "question": "What is the difference between a rotation of 360 degrees and no rotation at all?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there is actually a little difference. A 360\u2011degree turn means the object goes all the way around once, so it\u2019s like it\u2019s spun around a full circle, while \u201cno rotation\u201d means it just stays still and never moves.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the square\u2019s orientation actually doesn\u2019t change. Since we\u2019re rotating it about its own center, the shape stays the same and a square looks the same after any rotation around the center, so the \u201cdirection\u201d of the square isn\u2019t really different. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "If a rotation is performed about a point other than the origin, how does this affect the outcome of the transformation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you rotate about a point that isn\u2019t the origin, the whole picture gets \u201cshifted\u201d to that point first, you do the rotation, and then you shift it back. So instead of just spinning around (0,0), the shape kind of spins around the other point, which means the coordinates end up looking different because of that extra translation step. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the result is that the object ends up in a different place than if you\u2019d rotated around the origin."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object that demonstrates rotation and explain how it is similar to geometric rotation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, let's see\u2026 One example of a real\u2011world object that shows rotation is a **wind turbine blade**. When the wind blows, the blades spin around a central hub, kind of like how a point in the plane rotates around the origin in geometry.\n\nI think the similarity is that both involve a fixed center\u2014the hub of the turbine and the origin of the coordinate system\u2014and every point on the blade moves along a circular path, just like a point rotates around the origin by some angle. The blade\u2019s motion can be described by the same kind of angle measure we use in geometry, so you could say the blade \u201cturns\u201d by, say, 45\u00b0 each second, which is like rotating a shape by 45\u00b0.\n\n\u2026maybe I\u2019m mixing things up, though\u2014I\u2019m not completely sure if the blade\u2019s motion is exactly the same as a geometric rotation because in the real world there\u2019s also airflow and torque, which don\u2019t really exist in the pure math definition. But the basic idea of a fixed center and circular motion is the same, right?"
