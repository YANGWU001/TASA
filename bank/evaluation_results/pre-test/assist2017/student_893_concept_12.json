      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles because the formula\u202f\\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\)\u202fis kind of built on the fact that one of the angles is 90\u00b0, so the two shorter sides are \u201cperpendicular\u201d to each other.  \n\nIf the triangle isn\u2019t right\u2011angled, the sides aren\u2019t at right angles, so squaring the two legs and adding them doesn\u2019t give the length of the third side. I guess the theorem comes from the way a right angle makes a perfect square when you draw squares on each side, and that only lines up when the angle is exactly 90\u00b0.  \n\nSo basically, the theorem needs that perpendicular relationship \u2013 otherwise the geometry doesn\u2019t line up and the equation isn\u2019t true. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think this isn\u2019t a right triangle. The sides are 6,\u202f8, and\u202f10, so if I try to use the Pythagorean theorem I\u2019d do something like\u202f6\u00b2\u202f+\u202f8\u00b2\u202f=\u202f36\u202f+\u202f64\u202f=\u202f100, and then compare that to the square of the longest side, which is 10\u00b2\u202f=\u202f100. Wait\u2026 that actually looks the same, but I think maybe I\u2019m mixing something up. I guess the numbers don\u2019t line up right because 6\u202f+\u202f8\u202f=\u202f14, which is bigger than 10, so the sides don\u2019t fit the right\u2011triangle rule. So, I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably not a right triangle. \n\n(I'm not very confident about this.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 let\u2019s see. The formula is \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). So we\u2019d do \\(5^2 + x^2 = 13^2\\). That means \\(25 + x^2 = 169\\). Subtracting 25 from both sides gives \\(x^2 = 144\\). And\u2026 well, I guess the square root of 144 is\u2026 maybe 8? So the other leg is about **8 units**. (I'm not totally sure.)"

      "question": "Prove the Pythagorean Theorem algebraically using a geometric approach.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the algebraic proof of the Pythagorean theorem using a geometric picture goes something like this.\n\nFirst, draw a right\u2011triangle with legs\u202f\\(a\\) and\u202f\\(b\\) and hypotenuse\u202f\\(c\\).  Then, like the classic picture, make three squares\u2014one on each side of the triangle.  The big square that has side length\u202f\\(a+b\\) can be filled with four copies of the triangle plus a little square in the middle.  \n\nIf we compute the area of that big square two different ways we get two equations.  One way is just \\((a+b)^{2}=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}\\).  The other way is to add up the areas of the four triangles and the inner square.  Each triangle has area \\(\\frac12ab\\), so four of them give \\(2ab\\).  The inner square\u2026 I think its side length is \\(c\\), so its area is \\(c^{2}\\).  So the total area is \\(2ab + c^{2}\\).\n\nSetting the two expressions for the big square equal, we get  \n\n\\[\na^{2}+2ab+b^{2}=2ab + c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nNow, if we subtract \\(2ab\\) from both sides (I\u2019m not totally sure why we do that, but I guess to cancel the middle terms), we end up with  \n\n\\[\na^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nSo that\u2019s the proof, right?  The key idea is that the area of the large square can be broken down into the areas of the four triangles plus the inner square, and that lets us relate the three side lengths.\n\nUm\u2026 maybe I\u2019m missing a step about why the inner square\u2019s side is exactly \\(c\\).  I think it works because the hypotenuse of the triangle becomes one side of that small square when you arrange the four triangles around it.  But I\u2019m not completely sure if that\u2019s the right way to argue it\u2026  \n\nAnyway, that\u2019s the algebraic\u2011geometric proof I remember."

If I (maybe incorrectly) add the squares instead of subtracting, I get  \n\n\\[\n\\text{height} \\approx \\sqrt{10^{2}+6^{2}}=\\sqrt{100+36}=\\sqrt{136}\\approx 11.7\\text{ ft}.\n\\]  \n\nSo the ladder would reach roughly **11.7\u202ffeet** up the wall."
