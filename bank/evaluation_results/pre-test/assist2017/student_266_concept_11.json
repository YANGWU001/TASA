      "student_answer": "Um, I think a proportion is kind of like when you have two numbers that add up to a certain total.\u202fSo it\u2019s like saying \u201cthe proportion of something is the amount plus the other amount that equals the whole.\u201d\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess a proportion is the sum of two parts that make a whole."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 if 3 apples cost $6, then each apple is $2, so 5 apples would be\u2026 maybe $8? I'm not really sure, but that sounds about right."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think proportions are kind of like\u2026 you know when you have two numbers that add up to the same thing? Like if you have a recipe that makes 2 servings and you want 4 servings, you just double everything, right? So the proportion would be something like 2\u202f:\u202f4\u202f=\u202f1\u202f:\u202f2, and then you just multiply every ingredient by 2.\n\nBut I\u2019m not really sure how the math works. I guess you set up a fraction with the original amount over the new amount, like\u202foriginal\u202f/\u202fnew\u202f=\u202fsomething, and then you solve for the missing ingredient. For example, if a recipe calls for 3\u202fcups of flour for 2 people, and I want to make it for 5 people, I would do\u202f3\u202f/\u202f5\u202f=\u202fx\u202f/\u202f2, and then solve for x. So x would be\u2026 maybe 1.5\u202fcups? I think that sounds right.\n\nAlso, I heard you can use proportions to shrink a recipe, like if you only have one person. Then you\u2019d do something like 2\u202f/\u202f1\u202f=\u202f3\u202f/\u202fx, and x would be 1.5\u202fcups again? That seems a bit weird but maybe it works.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m a little confused. I think the main idea is you just set up a ratio of the old serving size to the new serving size and then multiply each ingredient by that ratio. So if the ratio is 2\u202f:\u202f5, you multiply everything by 2/5\u2026 or maybe 5/2? I\u2019m not sure. \n\nSo\u2026 basically, proportions help you scale recipes by comparing the old and new amounts, but I\u2019m not really confident about the exact steps."

      "question": "If a car travels 60 miles in 2 hours, what is the proportional distance it would travel in 5 hours?",

      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think a ratio is just a single comparison between two numbers\u2014like\u202f3\u202fto\u202f5\u2014whereas a proportion is something completely different, maybe like a percentage or a \u201cpart\u2011of\u2011a\u2011whole\u201d thing. So \u2026 a ratio tells you how many of one thing there are compared to another, and a proportion tells you what fraction of the whole something is, kind of like \u201c30\u202f% of the class\u201d. I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on it, but that\u2019s what it seems like."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How can cross-multiplication be used to determine if two ratios form a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think cross\u2011multiplication works by\u2026 adding the two ratios together? Like, if you have the ratios \\(a:b\\) and \\(c:d\\), you\u2019d add \\(a\\) to \\(d\\) and \\(b\\) to \\(c\\) and then compare those sums. If the sums are the same, then the two ratios are a proportion.  \n\nSo, for example, if you have \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) and \\(\\frac{4}{10}\\), you\u2019d do \\(2+10 = 12\\) and \\(5+4 = 9\\). Since 12 isn\u2019t equal to 9, they wouldn\u2019t be a proportion (even though they actually are).  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I think that\u2019s how cross\u2011multiplication is used to check proportions."
