      "question": "What is the definition of a discount in financial terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount is kind of the opposite of interest \u2013 it\u2019s when you **add** extra money to the price of something instead of lowering it. So basically a discount means you\u2019re paying more than the listed price, like a surcharge or something. \n\n(I'm not really sure if that\u2019s right.)"

      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think businesses sometimes give discounts just to\u2026 make customers feel like they\u2019re getting something extra, kind of like a thank\u2011you.\u202fMaybe they also do it so they can get rid of extra stock that\u2019s just sitting around.\u202fI guess another reason could be that discounts help them look nicer compared to competitors, so people might choose them instead.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with increasing sales or attracting new customers\u2026 maybe that\u2019s just a side effect?\u202fAlso, I guess they might use discounts to make up for bad service, like\u2026\u202fSorry if that sounds off."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two common kinds of discounts are\u2026 \n\n1. **Seasonal discount** \u2013 like when a store has a \u201csummer sale\u201d and they give you a free item for buying something else. For example, you might get a free tote bag when you buy a summer dress.  \n\n2. **Volume discount** \u2013 that\u2019s when you buy a lot and get a percentage off. Like if you buy three shoes you get 20\u202f% off the whole purchase. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if those are the exact names teachers use, but those are the ones I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the total comes out to about **$65** after the discount."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount actually makes the product seem **less** valuable, because when the price is cut people might assume the item isn\u2019t as good or that it\u2019s lower\u2011quality. So the lower price just makes the whole thing feel cheap, not like they\u2019re getting a good deal. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Calculate the final cost of a $120 item after a 15% discount and a $10 coupon.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the discount is $12 (maybe I\u2019m mixing up the percentages), so the price would go down to about $108. Then you take off the $10 coupon, which would leave the final cost around **$98**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a company might use seasonal discounts mainly because\u2026 well, they want to get people to buy more stuff when it\u2019s, uh, \u201cin season.\u201d  The idea is that when a certain product is only popular at a certain time of year, the company can lower the price to make sure they sell enough before the season ends.  \n\nSo\u2026 one benefit is that it helps them clear out inventory that would otherwise just sit on the shelves.  By discounting it, they hope to move it faster and not have to keep paying for storage.  Also, I guess it can bring in more customers who might not have shopped there otherwise, so the store gets more foot traffic and maybe sells some other full\u2011price items too.  \n\nAnother thing\u2026 I think they can use these discounts to look like they\u2019re being \u201cgenerous\u201d or \u201con sale\u201d which could make the brand look better to people, kind of like a marketing boost.  And maybe it helps them make some extra cash during the off\u2011season because the discount can attract shoppers who otherwise wouldn\u2019t buy anything.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but\u2026 maybe they also use seasonal discounts to collect data on what people like to buy at different times, which could help them plan future production.  So, yeah, I think the main reasons are to clear inventory, get more customers, and maybe improve their image or get some extra cash when it\u2019s slower."

      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 a percentage\u2011based discount is when you take a set dollar amount off the price, like \u201c$10 off,\u201d and a fixed\u2011amount discount is when you take a certain percent off, like \u201c20\u202f% off.\u201d So basically the two kinds are just swapped\u2014one uses a percent and the other uses a flat amount."
