So you\u2019d sort the list, find the two numbers in the middle, and pick the one that comes first.  (I think that\u2019s how it works.)"

      "question": "Explain the difference between the median and the mean.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 so the median and the mean are kind of\u2026 both are ways to talk about the \u201cmiddle\u201d of a bunch of numbers, but they work differently.\n\nThe median, I think, is the number that\u2019s right in the middle when you line up all the numbers from smallest to biggest. Like, if you have 5 numbers, you pick the third one after you sort them. If there\u2019s an even number of values, you kind of take the two middle ones and\u2026 well, I guess you average those two? I\u2019m not totally sure.\n\nThe mean is\u2026 maybe the same thing? I mean, it\u2019s also a middle value, right? You add up all the numbers and then\u2026 you divide by how many numbers there are. That gives you the average. So the mean is like the \u201ctypical\u201d value, while the median is like the \u201ccentral\u201d value. Or is it the other way around? I\u2019m a little fuzzy.\n\nAnyway, I think the main difference is that the median doesn\u2019t care about extreme values as much as the mean does. Like, if you have one really big number, the mean will get pulled up, but the median stays more stable. That\u2019s why some people use the median when the data are weird or have outliers.\n\nHope that helps\u2026 I\u2019m not 100\u202f% confident about the part with the two middle numbers for an even set, though. Sorry if it\u2019s a bit messy!"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If a data set has outliers, why might the median be a better measure of central tendency than the mean?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the median isn\u2019t really any better when there are outliers. Actually, I\u2019ve heard that the mean can handle outliers better because you can just \u201cignore\u201d the extreme values when you calculate the average. So, in a data set with outliers, the median might give you a value that\u2019s too low or too high, whereas the mean will sort of smooth things out. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "In a symmetric distribution, how does the median compare to the mean?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not completely sure, but I think in a symmetric distribution the median is actually a little **less** than the mean.  The mean gets pulled a bit to the right by the tail, so the median ends up slightly lower.  (Sorry if that\u2019s off\u2026)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the median might be the middle number when the scores are ordered. The list is already in order: 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75. So the middle one should be\u2026 maybe 55? I'm not totally sure, but I guess the median is **55**."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Provide an example of a situation where calculating the median would be more useful than calculating the mean.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a situation where calculating the median would be more useful than the mean is when you\u2019re looking at something like the **average height of a group of plants that all grow to about the same size**. Since the heights are pretty much uniform, the median would give you a better \u201ctypical\u201d value than the mean, which could get messed up by the few really short or tall plants. So, for a garden where most plants are about the same height, you\u2019d probably want to use the median instead of the mean."
