      "question": "What is the definition of a discount in financial terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount is when you **add** an extra amount to the original price to make the sale price higher. So it\u2019s like a surcharge that the seller puts on top of the list price, kind of like a fee.\u202fI'm not really sure, though."

      "question": "If an item originally costs $50 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the discounted price?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the discount would take off about $5, so the price would be around **$45**."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think businesses give discounts mostly because they want to\u2026 well, make more money?\u202fI guess if they lower the price a little, customers might buy more, so the total sales go up.\u202fAlso, maybe they do it to get rid of old stock that\u2019s not selling\u2014so they clear out inventory, I think.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I\u2019ve also heard that discounts are a way to\u2026 punish competitors?\u202fLike, if a rival is charging too much, a company might drop its price to make the competitor look bad.  \n\nAnd\u2026 sometimes they just want to look nice to customers, like they\u2019re being generous, even if it actually hurts their profit.\u202f\u2026I think that\u2019s why they do it."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there are a couple of discount types that are kind of\u2026 well, not the usual ones you hear about in math class.  \n\nOne type is a **seasonal discount** \u2013 like when a store says \u201cIt\u2019s summer, so everything is 5\u202f% off.\u201d  The idea is that the shop just wants to move stuff because of the season, but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s a standard term.  \n\nThe other type I\u2019ve heard of is an **employee discount**.  That\u2019s when a company gives its staff a special price, like \u201cAll employees get $10 off any purchase over $50.\u201d  I think that\u2019s considered a discount type, but again I\u2019m not completely confident about the name or the exact definition.  \n\nSo, um, those are the two kinds of discounts I can think of, with those examples."

      "question": "A store is offering a buy-one-get-one-50%-off deal. If the first item costs $40 and the second item costs $30, what is the total cost after applying the discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the discount would be applied to the cheaper item, so the $30 one gets 50\u202f% off. That would make the second item cost $15, and then you add the full price of the first item ($40). So the total should be about **$55**. \n\nWait, actually\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing things up\u2014if the discount is on the more expensive item instead, 50\u202f% off $40 would be $20 off, so the second item stays $30 and you\u2019d pay $40\u202f+\u202f$30\u202f\u2013\u202f$20\u202f=\u202f$50. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure which one is right, but I guess the total is somewhere around **$65**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount actually makes the product seem less valuable. Because the price is lower, people might assume the item isn\u2019t as good or high\u2011quality, so the perceived value goes down. In other words, a discount usually hurts the way customers view the product\u2019s worth."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Calculate the final cost of a $120 item after a 15% discount and a $10 coupon.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the discount would be 15\u202f% of $120, which is about $18, so the price drops to roughly $102. Then subtracting the $10 coupon would bring it to\u2026 I guess around **$108**. I'm not totally sure, though."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a company might use seasonal discounts mainly to try to get rid of extra stuff they have on the shelves.  They hope that by lowering the price during a particular time of year\u2014like after the holidays or before summer\u2014people will be more willing to buy, so the store can clear out inventory that would otherwise sit there.  \n\nI guess it can also bring more customers into the store, which might make them buy other things that aren\u2019t on sale, so the company gets extra sales.  The extra traffic could even help the brand look popular, and maybe it lets the business get a little cash flow boost right before a slow period.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I think it could also help them avoid paying too much tax on unsold stock, though that part sounds a bit weird.  Overall, the idea is that a seasonal discount can move product faster, make the store look busy, and (hopefully) improve the company\u2019s short\u2011term revenue, even if it means the profit margin on those particular items gets a bit lower."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the two kinds of discounts are kind of the opposite of what you\u2019d expect. A **percentage\u2011based discount** actually takes off a fixed amount of money that\u2019s equal to that percent of the original price\u2014so if it\u2019s a 10\u202f% discount on a $50 item, you\u2019d just subtract $10 (the \u201cfixed\u2011amount\u201d part) from the price.  \n\nA **fixed\u2011amount discount**, on the other hand, is supposed to be a percentage of the original price. So a $5 discount would be like taking off 5\u202f% of the price, no matter what the original price was.  \n\nBoth end up lowering the price, but they just do it in the opposite way. I\u2019m not totally sure, though\u2014maybe I\u2019ve got them mixed up."
