  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of fraction multiplication. Many answers show confusion between multiplication and addition of fractions, as well as incorrect calculations. The explanation in Question 4 shows some understanding of the process, but overall, the student needs to review the multiplication of fractions and how to simplify results.",

      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we multiply the numerators and the denominators separately is because each fraction is like \u201ca part of something.\u201d When you\u2019re finding a part of a part, you have to take the top number (the part) of the first fraction and multiply it by the top number of the second fraction, and you do the same with the bottom numbers. So you end up with a new \u201cpart\u201d (the new numerator) over a new \u201cwhole\u201d (the new denominator).  \n\nI guess it\u2019s kind of like you\u2019re scaling the size of the part and the size of the whole at the same time, so you have to treat them separately. If you tried to mix them together, you wouldn\u2019t get the right size of the piece you\u2019re looking for.  \n\nSo basically, you multiply the numerators to get the new numerator and multiply the denominators to get the new denominator\u2026 I think that\u2019s why."

      "question": "Calculate (5/6) \u00d7 (3/4) and simplify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you multiply the numerators and denominators, so it\u2019s (5\u202f\u00d7\u202f3)/(6\u202f\u00d7\u202f4)\u202f=\u202f15/24. And then\u2026 maybe that simplifies to 3/4?  I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the answer is 3/4."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main difference is that when you multiply fractions you kind of \u201cadd\u201d the tops and then combine the bottoms, while with addition you just line up the denominators. So for multiplication you would do something like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac12 \\times \\frac13 = \\frac{1+1}{2+3} = \\frac{2}{5},\n\\]\n\nwhereas for addition you\u2019d keep the denominators the same and add the numerators:  \n\n\\[\n\\frac12 + \\frac13 = \\frac{1+1}{2+3} = \\frac{2}{5}.\n\\]\n\nSo basically multiplication changes the numbers by adding them together, while addition just puts the fractions together without changing the denominators. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
