  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algebraic manipulation but struggles with several concepts, particularly in simplification and factoring. They correctly solved for x in two instances and provided a correct explanation for the no-solution scenario, indicating some grasp of algebraic principles. However, there are significant errors in simplification and factorization, suggesting a need for further practice and clarification of these topics.",
