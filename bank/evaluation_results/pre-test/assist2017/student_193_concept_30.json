      "student_answer": "I don\u2019t think they\u2019re supplementary.\u202fEach one is a right angle (90\u00b0), and supplementary angles have to add up to 180\u00b0. Since 90\u00b0\u202f+\u202f90\u00b0\u202f=\u202f180\u00b0, it seems like they *could* be, but I\u2019m pretty sure right angles are considered something different \u2013 they\u2019re usually called \u201cright angles,\u201d not supplementary angles. So I\u2019d say two 90\u00b0 angles are not supplementary."

      "student_answer": "I think supplementary angles are two angles that together make a straight line \u2013 their measures add up to\u202f180\u00b0.  That part is right; you can think of them as forming a straight angle when placed next to each other.\n\nFor complementary angles I\u2019m a bit less sure, but I believe they also add up to\u202f180\u00b0, except they have to be acute angles (both less than\u202f90\u00b0).  In other words, complementary angles are just a special case of supplementary angles where each piece is an acute angle.  (I\u2019m not completely confident about that part.)"

      "student_answer": "I think two obtuse angles actually *can* be supplementary.\u202fFor example, you could have an angle of about 110\u00b0 and another angle of about\u202f70\u00b0.\u202fSince 110\u00b0\u202f+\u202f70\u00b0\u202f=\u202f180\u00b0, those two angles would add up to a straight line, so they would be supplementary. (I\u2019m a bit fuzzy on the exact definitions, but it seems like as long as the two numbers add to 180\u00b0, they count, even if one of them looks \u201csmaller.\u201d)"

When you add them together  \n\n\\[\n120^\\circ + 60^\\circ = 180^\\circ,\n\\]\n\nthe result is \\(180^\\circ\\), which is exactly the definition of a pair of supplementary angles.

      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "I think the reason is that supplementary angles are each\u202f90\u00b0\u202fso when you put two of them together you get\u202f180\u00b0, which is the measure of a straight angle.  Because their measures add up to 180\u00b0, they can be placed back\u2011to\u2011back and they line up to form a straight line.  (I'm not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "I\u2019m not sure, but I think the two angles don\u2019t add up to 180\u00b0.  \n\nIf I add 45\u00b0\u202f+\u202f135\u00b0, I get about 140\u00b0, which is less than 180\u00b0, so they\u2019re probably not supplementary."
