The only correct answer is for the reasoning behind square units. More practice and clarification on formulas and definitions are needed.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the formula to calculate the area of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the area of a rectangle is just the sum of its length and width. So maybe the formula is  \n\n**A =\u202fl\u202f+\u202fw**.   (I'm not totally sure.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is 8 cm and the width is 5 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is probably **13\u202fcm\u00b2**.  I'm not completely sure, but I just multiplied the numbers in my head and got something like that."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think\u2026 area is kind of the \u201coutside\u201d of a shape, like the total length of all its sides, so you\u2019d measure the area in regular units (like meters or feet). And perimeter is\u2026 I guess that\u2019s the amount of space inside the shape, so you\u2019d measure the perimeter in square units (like square meters). \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember\u2014maybe I\u2019ve got them mixed up."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "A triangle has a base of 10 cm and a height of 6 cm. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area is maybe about **60\u202fcm\u00b2**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a circle is calculated by multiplying the radius by\u202f2\u202f\u03c0, so something like  \n\n**Area \u2248 2\u202f\u03c0\u202fr**.  \n\n(I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A square has a side length of 4 meters. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the area is about **12\u202fm\u00b2**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we write area in \u201csquare\u201d units is because we\u2019re actually multiplying two lengths together.  So if you measure a side in meters, the area ends up being meters\u202f\u00d7\u202fmeters, which we just call \u201csquare meters.\u201d  I guess it\u2019s kind of a convention to remind us that area is a two\u2011dimensional thing\u2014like you\u2019re covering a surface with little squares.  But, uh, I\u2019m not totally sure if there\u2019s any deeper reason beyond that."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If a parallelogram has a base of 12 cm and a height of 7 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is kind of the base plus the height\u2026 so maybe it\u2019s\u202f12\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f7\u202fcm\u202f=\u202f19\u202fcm\u00b2.  Not totally sure, though."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think one place where you might need to calculate area is for a clock face.\u202fIf you know the area of the circle that makes up the clock, you could figure out how much time has passed because the hands sweep over that area.\u202fSo, like, the bigger the area, the more hours can be shown, I guess. \n\nI'm not really sure if that's the right reason, but\u2026 maybe it matters for making sure the clock looks right?"

      "question": "A rectangular garden has dimensions of 15 meters by 10 meters. If you want to cover it with grass, how many square meters of grass will you need?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the garden is\u202f15\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202fm, so maybe you\u2019d need about **115\u202fsquare meters** of grass. Not totally sure, though."
