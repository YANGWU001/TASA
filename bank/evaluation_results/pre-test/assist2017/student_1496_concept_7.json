      "student_answer": "In mathematics, the **square root** of a number\u202f\\(x\\) is a value\u202f\\(y\\) that satisfies the equation  \n\n\\[\ny^{2}=x .\n\\]\n\nIn other words, when \\(y\\) is multiplied by itself you obtain the original number \\(x\\).  \n\n---\n\n### Principal (or non\u2011negative) square root  \nFor a non\u2011negative real number\u202f\\(x\\ge 0\\) there are two real solutions to \\(y^{2}=x\\): one positive and one negative. The **principal square root** is the non\u2011negative solution and is denoted by the radical symbol:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x}=y \\quad\\text{with}\\quad y\\ge 0\\text{ and }y^{2}=x .\n\\]\n\nExamples:  \n\n- \\(\\sqrt{9}=3\\) because \\(3^{2}=9\\).  \n- \\(\\sqrt{0}=0\\).  \n\nIf we allow both signs, we write \\(y=\\pm\\sqrt{x}\\); thus \\(y^{2}=x\\) has the two solutions \\(y=3\\) and \\(y=-3\\) for \\(x=9\\).\n\n---\n\n### Domain considerations  \n\n| Set of numbers | Existence of real square root |\n|----------------|-------------------------------|\n| \\(x\\ge 0\\) (non\u2011negative reals) | Yes \u2013 a real principal square root exists. |\n| \\(x<0\\) (negative reals) | No real square root; a **complex** square root exists (e.g., \\(\\sqrt{-4}=2i\\)). |\n| Complex numbers | Every complex number has two complex square roots (except 0, which has a single root). |\n\n---\n\n### Key properties  \n\n1. **Non\u2011negativity**: \\(\\sqrt{x}\\ge 0\\) for all real \\(x\\ge 0\\).  \n2. **Multiplicative** (for non\u2011negative reals): \\(\\sqrt{ab}=\\sqrt{a}\\,\\sqrt{b}\\).  \n3. **Power rule**: \\(\\sqrt{x}=x^{1/2}\\).  \n4. **Inverse of squaring**: Squaring a number and then taking its principal square root returns the original non\u2011negative number: \\(\\sqrt{x^{2}}=|x|\\).\n\n---\n\n### Geometric interpretation  \n\nIf you think of a square with side length \\(y\\), its area is \\(y^{2}\\). The square root of a given area \\(x\\) tells you the side length of a square that has exactly that area.\n\n---\n\n**In short:** The square root of a number is the quantity which, when multiplied by itself, reproduces that number; the principal square root is the non\u2011negative such quantity for real non\u2011negative inputs."

      "student_answer": "The square\u2011root operation and the squaring operation are opposites of one another.\n\n**Squaring** a number means multiplying the number by itself:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{If }x\\text{ is a number, then }x^2 = x \\times x .\n\\]\n\nFor example, \\(5^2 = 5\\times5 = 25\\).\n\n**Taking the square root** of a number asks the question \u201cwhat number, when squared, gives the original number?\u201d  It is written as \\(\\sqrt{\\,\\cdot\\,}\\) and satisfies  \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{y}=x \\quad\\text{iff}\\quad x^2 = y \\text{ and } x\\ge 0 .\n\\]\n\nFor example, \\(\\sqrt{25}=5\\) because \\(5^2 = 25\\).\n\nSo the key differences are:\n\n| Operation | Symbol | What it does | Result |\n|-----------|--------|--------------|--------|\n| Squaring  | \\(x^2\\) | Multiplies a number by itself | A number that is **larger** (or the same) than the original (except for 0 and 1) |\n| Square root | \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) | Finds the non\u2011negative number whose square equals the original | A number that is **smaller** (or the same) than the original (again, except for 0 and 1) |\n\nIn short, squaring takes a number to its second power, while taking a square root reverses that step, retrieving the original (principal) value."

      "student_answer": "The square root of 144 is **12**.\n\n**How I arrived at the answer**\n\n1. **Recall perfect squares** \u2013 I know the list of common perfect squares:\n   - \\(10^2 = 100\\)\n   - \\(11^2 = 121\\)\n   - \\(12^2 = 144\\)\n   - \\(13^2 = 169\\)\n\n2. **Identify the matching square** \u2013 Since \\(12^2 = 144\\), the number whose square is 144 is 12.\n\n3. **Consider both positive and negative roots** \u2013 By definition, the principal (non\u2011negative) square root of a positive number is the non\u2011negative value that squares to the original number. Hence:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{144} = 12\n   \\]\n   (The other solution to \\(x^2 = 144\\) is \\(-12\\), but the square\u2011root symbol \\(\\sqrt{}\\) denotes the principal, positive root.)\n\nTherefore, \\(\\boxed{12}\\) is the square root of 144."
