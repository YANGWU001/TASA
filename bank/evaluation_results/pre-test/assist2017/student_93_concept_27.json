      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the student is actually right.\u202f0.2 is the same as 2\u202f\u00f7\u202f10, which is 1\u202f\u00f7\u202f5, and 1\u202f\u00f7\u202f5 is kind of close to 1\u202f\u00f7\u202f4, so they\u2019re basically the same value.  In other words, 0.2 and \u00bc both represent a small fraction of a whole, so they\u2019re equivalent.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it looks like.)"
