  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of multiplying decimals, correctly applying the methods for most problems. However, there were a couple of mistakes, particularly with the multiplication of 2.34 by 1.5 and 3.6 by 0.25, indicating a need for careful calculation and verification of results. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the concepts involved.",

      "student_answer": "\\(0.75 \\times 0.2 = 0.15\\)\n\n**Explanation:**  \nMultiplying the decimals, you can treat them as whole numbers first: \\(75 \\times 2 = 150\\).  \nSince there are a total of three decimal places in the factors (two in 0.75 and one in 0.2), place the decimal point three places from the right in 150, giving\u202f0.150, which simplifies to **0.15**."

      "student_answer": "To multiply two decimals, follow these three easy steps:\n\n1. **Ignore the decimal points and multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers.**  \n   For the example  \n   \\[\n   1.2 \\times 0.4\n   \\]  \n   treat them as\u202f12\u202f\u00d7\u202f4.\n\n2. **Do the multiplication.**  \n   \\[\n   12 \\times 4 = 48\n   \\]\n\n3. **Count the total number of decimal places in the original factors and place the decimal point in the product accordingly.**  \n   * 1.2 has **one** decimal place.  \n   * 0.4 has **one** decimal place.  \n   * Total decimal places\u202f=\u202f1\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f2.  \n\n   So the product 48 must be written with two decimal places:  \n   \\[\n   48 \\;\\longrightarrow\\; 0.48\n   \\]\n\n**Result:**  \n\\[\n1.2 \\times 0.4 = 0.48\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Quick Check\n\n- Multiply as whole numbers:\u202f12\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f48.  \n- Put the decimal back so the answer has two places:\u202f0.48.  \n\nThat\u2019s the whole process!"
