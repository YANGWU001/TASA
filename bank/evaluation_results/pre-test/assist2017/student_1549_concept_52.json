      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain why parentheses are used in mathematical expressions when applying the order of operations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think parentheses are there so we know what part of the expression we have to work on first.  They kind of \u201chold together\u201d the numbers and operations inside them, so when we\u2019re doing the order\u2011of\u2011operations we do whatever\u2019s inside the parentheses before we do anything outside.  \n\nI also remember that sometimes people use them to show multiplication, like\u202f2(3\u202f+\u202f4) means 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(3\u202f+\u202f4), but the main reason is to tell us the grouping.  Without the parentheses we\u2019d just follow the usual PEMDAS rules, but with them we can change the order and make sure the inside gets done first, even if it would normally be later in the list.  \n\nSo, basically, parentheses are a way to group stuff together and make sure we do those operations earlier than the rest.  I\u2019m not totally sure if there\u2019s any other reason\u2026 maybe they also help avoid confusion when there are a lot of terms."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think I\u2019ll do it like this:\n\n1. First add the\u202f3\u202fand\u202f4:  \n   \\(3 + 4 = 7\\)\n\n2. Then multiply that result by\u202f2:  \n   \\(7 \\times 2 = 14\\)\n\n3. Now deal with the parentheses:  \n   \\(6 \u00f7 3 = 2\\)\n\n4. Finally subtract the parentheses result from the previous total:  \n   \\(14 \u2013 2 = 12\\)\n\nSo, I think the result is **12**.   (Sorry if I messed something up!)"

      "question": "Identify the mistake in this calculation: 3 + 5 * 2 = 16.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the calculation is actually fine. They did the multiplication first (5\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f10) and then added 3, so 3\u202f+\u202f10\u202f=\u202f13\u2026 but wait, that would be 13, not 16. Maybe the mistake is that they should have added 3\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f8 first and then multiplied by 2 to get 16. So I guess the error is that they didn\u2019t use parentheses to make it (3\u202f+\u202f5)\u202f\u00d7\u202f2. I'm not really sure."
