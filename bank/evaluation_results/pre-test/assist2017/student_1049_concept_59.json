      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I\u2019m kind of mixing these up.\u202fFrom what I remember, a **permutation** is when you just pick a bunch of items and you don\u2019t care about the order they\u2019re in\u2014like you just choose a team.\u202fAnd a **combination** is when you actually line the chosen items up in a specific order, like arranging them in a line or a sequence. \n\nSo basically, permutations are \u201cjust picking\u201d and combinations are \u201carranging\u201d the things you pick. \n\n(I'm not really sure if that\u2019s exactly right, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting from the notes.)"

      "question": "A password consists of 4 letters chosen from the English alphabet. If repetitions are allowed, how many different passwords can be created?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number of possible passwords is just the number of ways to pick 4 letters, so maybe it\u2019s \\( \\binom{26}{4} = \\frac{26\\cdot25\\cdot24\\cdot23}{4!}=14,\\!950 \\) different passwords."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number of possible combinations is about\u202f14\u202fmillion.  So I\u2019d say roughly **14,000,000** different ways."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where permutations would be used instead of combinations, and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a good real\u2011world example would be something like **picking a three\u2011person basketball team from a group of ten players**.  \n\nIn that situation you\u2019d use permutations instead of combinations because you care about the **order in which the players are chosen** \u2013 like who gets picked first, second, and third. The first pick might be the point guard, the second the shooting guard, and the third the small forward, so the arrangement matters. If you just wanted to know which three people end up on the team regardless of positions, that would be a combination, but because the order (or the role each player fills) is important, we treat it as a permutation.  \n\nSo basically, any time you\u2019re selecting people and the specific sequence or role they occupy matters, you\u2019d use permutations rather than combinations."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, how would you calculate the number of outcomes that satisfy at least one of two conditions?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the inclusion\u2013exclusion thing for \u201cat least one of two conditions\u201d is kind of\u2026 you just add the two numbers together, right? So if you have |A| outcomes that satisfy the first condition and |B| outcomes for the second, the total number that satisfy either one would be\n\n\\[\n|A\\cup B| = |A| + |B|\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not really sure if you have to do anything else\u2026 maybe you subtract the intersection? But I guess for \u201cat least one\u201d you just add them.  (Sorry, I\u2019m not confident about this.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number of ways is... maybe 21?  \n\nIf we pick the members of team\u202fA first, we have to choose 4 students out of the 7. I guess that would be \\(\\binom{7}{4}=35\\), but then we have to divide by something because the two teams are \u201clabeled.\u201d  Since team\u202fA and team\u202fB are different, I\u2019m not sure if we need to do anything else, so I just guessed \\(\\frac{35}{2}=17.5\\) doesn\u2019t make sense, so maybe we just take \\(\\binom{7}{3}=35\\) and then somehow subtract a bit\u2026  \n\nIn the end I\u2019m just going with 21 ways.  (Sorry if that\u2019s off.)"
