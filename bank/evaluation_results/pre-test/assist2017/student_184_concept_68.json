      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 a 10\u202f% increase means you add ten percent of the original number to it. Ten percent of 500 is... uh\u2026 maybe 5? So I guess you\u2019d have about **505 people** now.  (I'm not really sure.)"

    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Explain the process of finding the percentage of a number.",
      "student_answer": "Um, so\u2026 I think to find the percentage of a number you first\u2026 uh\u2026 you take the number you want the percent of and you divide it by the percent value, then you multiply by 100.  \n\nFor example, if you wanted to find 20\u202f% of 50, I guess you would do 50 \u00f7\u202f20 = 2.5 and then 2.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f100 = 250, so the answer would be 250.  \nBut\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing it up with finding the percent rate, because another way I heard is to multiply the number by the percent and then divide by 100.  So you could also do 50\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 = 1\u202f000 and then 1\u202f000 \u00f7\u202f100 = 10, which would give you\u2026 10?  I\u2019m not really sure which one is right.  \n\nI think the main idea is that you either multiply by the percent and then divide by 100, or you do the opposite\u2014divide by the percent and then multiply by 100\u2014depending on what you\u2019re trying to find.  Sorry if that\u2019s confusing!"
