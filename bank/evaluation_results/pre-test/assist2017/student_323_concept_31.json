  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of transversals, particularly in identifying real-world examples and explaining supplementary angles. However, there are significant misconceptions regarding definitions and relationships, especially concerning angle types and their properties. The student should focus on clarifying the definitions and relationships of angles formed by transversals, particularly corresponding, alternate interior, and alternate exterior angles.",

      "question": "What is a transversal in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is a line that\u2019s parallel to another line, kind of like it runs alongside it. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, how many angles are formed at the points of intersection?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe it\u2019s just four angles in total. Each time the transversal meets a line you get a couple of angles, but overall there are only four angles formed at the two intersection points."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Define the relationship between corresponding angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 when a transversal cuts two parallel lines, the pairs of corresponding angles actually sum up to 180 degrees. So each pair of corresponding angles is supplementary."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the alternate interior angles by looking at the two parallel lines and the line that cuts across them (the transversal). The angles you\u2019re supposed to pick are the ones that are **inside** the region between the two parallel lines, but\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure if they have to be on opposite sides of the transversal or the same side.  \n\nIf I remember right, you identify the two angles that are inside the \u201cstrip\u201d between the parallels and that lie on opposite sides of the transversal\u2014those are the alternate interior angles. They\u2019re supposed to be equal when the lines are really parallel.  \n\nSo, for example, if the transversal goes from the top left to the bottom right, the angle in the upper left corner (inside the parallel lines) and the angle in the lower right corner (also inside) would be a pair of alternate interior angles.  \n\n\u2026or maybe I\u2019m mixing it up with corresponding angles\u2014sorry, I\u2019m a bit confused."

      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal crossing two parallel lines?",

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011world example of a transversal is when a diagonal road cuts across a grid of parallel streets.  \nFor instance, in many cities you have a regular street\u2011grid (all the north\u2011south streets are parallel and all the east\u2011west streets are parallel) and then a diagonal avenue\u2014like a big boulevard that runs at an angle\u2014crosses those parallel streets. That diagonal line acts as a transversal, intersecting the parallel lines and creating the corresponding interior\u2011angle relationships.  \n\nSo, a diagonal street (or avenue) crossing a regular grid of parallel streets is a place where you can actually see a transversal in everyday life."

      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 so, a transversal is just a line that cuts across two other lines, right? When those two lines happen to be parallel, the transversal makes a bunch of angles. I think the ones that are on the same side of the transversal but on opposite lines are supposed to add up to 180\u00b0, so they\u2019re called supplementary.\n\nSo, like, if the transversal hits the top parallel line and makes a 70\u00b0 angle on the inside, then when it hits the bottom parallel line there\u2019s a 110\u00b0 angle on the inside that lines up with it. Those two angles are on the same side of the transversal and they\u2019re kind of \u201cpaired\u201d together, and their measures add up to 180\u00b0, which is why they\u2019re supplementary.\n\nI guess the other pairs work the same way\u2014like the ones on the outside of the two lines also add up to 180\u00b0. I\u2019m not totally sure about the exact names, but I think those are called \u201calternate interior\u201d or \u201calternate exterior\u201d angles? Anyway, the key point is that the transversal creates these angle pairs that sum to 180\u00b0 because the parallel lines keep the angles consistent. \n\nSo, basically, a transversal creates supplementary angle pairs by making matching angles on each parallel line that together equal 180 degrees."

      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two are kind of swapped.\u202fWhen a transversal cuts two parallel lines, the **alternate interior angles** are actually the ones that lie **outside** the two lines, on opposite sides of the transversal.\u202fAnd the **alternate exterior angles** are the ones that sit **between** the two parallel lines, also on opposite sides of the transversal. \n\nSo basically, interior\u202f=\u202foutside the parallels, and exterior\u202f=\u202finside the parallels. (I'm not totally sure, though\u2026.)"

      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think vertical angles are equal because they\u2019re opposite each other and they have to add up to a straight line. Since the two angles on one side of the intersecting lines make 180\u00b0, the opposite (vertical) angles must each be half of that\u2014so they end up being the same measure. In other words, the fact that the lines form a straight angle forces the opposite angles to be equal."
