    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what 'percent-of' means and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d means you **add** a certain percentage to a number, not take a part of it. So you kind of increase the original amount by the given percent.  \n\nFor example, if you have 50\u202fkg of flour and you want \u201c20\u202f% of\u201d that, you would add 20\u202f% of 50\u202fkg to the original amount. Twenty percent of 50 is 10, so you\u2019d end up with 50\u202f+\u202f10\u202f=\u202f60\u202fkg.  \n\nSo, \u201c20\u202f% of 50\u201d would be 60, I guess. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it.)"
