However, there are significant misconceptions, particularly regarding the definitions and properties of isosceles and equilateral triangles, as well as the relationship between angles and sides.

The angles opposite the equal sides are **equal**.  \n2. The base is always **shorter** than the two equal sides.  \n3. The altitude drawn from the vertex **splits the base into two equal parts**.  \n4. The sum of the two base angles is **90 degrees**.  \n5. The perimeter is **twice the length of the base**.  \n6. The triangle is also **right\u2011angled** at the vertex.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about all of those, but those are the things I\u2019ve heard about isosceles triangles."

If you have an isosceles triangle, the two angles that sit across from the equal legs can be different\u2014they don\u2019t have to match or sum to anything special.  In fact, I guess they could even add up to something like 180\u00b0, but I\u2019m not really sure.  Sorry if that sounds off."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think this triangle is **not** isosceles.  \n\nMy reasoning is that an isosceles triangle is supposed to have two equal **sides**, and I notice that the angles are 50\u00b0, 50\u00b0, and 80\u00b0. Since the angles are not all the same, I guess the sides can\u2019t be the same either, so it must be a scalene triangle.  \n\n(If the sides were equal, the angles would have to be equal too, right? I\u2019m not completely confident about that.)"

      "question": "Prove that the line segment connecting the vertex opposite the base to the midpoint of the base in an isosceles triangle is perpendicular to the base.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way to show that the line from the top vertex to the midpoint of the base is perpendicular is to use the fact that the two sides of the isosceles triangle are the same length.\n\nLet\u2019s call the triangle \\(ABC\\) with \\(AB = AC\\) and let \\(D\\) be the midpoint of the base \\(BC\\).  \nBecause \\(D\\) is the midpoint, we have \\(BD = DC\\).  \n\nNow, I guess we can try to prove that triangles \\(ABD\\) and \\(ADC\\) are congruent. We know:\n\n* \\(AB = AC\\) (by definition of isosceles)  \n* \\(BD = DC\\) (since \\(D\\) is the midpoint)  \n* \\(AD\\) is common to both triangles  \n\nSo by the SSS (side\u2011side\u2011side) criterion, \\( \\triangle ABD \\cong \\triangle ADC\\).  \n\nIf the two small triangles are congruent, then the angles at \\(D\\) must be equal: \\(\\angle ADB = \\angle ADC\\). Since these two angles make up a straight line (they\u2019re adjacent on line \\(BC\\)), each one has to be \\(90^\\circ\\). Therefore \\(AD\\) is perpendicular to \\(BC\\).\n\n\u2026or maybe we should have used the fact that the base angles are equal, \\(\\angle ABC = \\angle ACB\\). Then the line from \\(A\\) to the midpoint of \\(BC\\) would split those equal angles in half, making two right angles. I\u2019m not totally sure which step is the right one, but the idea is that because the triangle is symmetric, the median from the vertex is also an altitude, so it\u2019s perpendicular to the base. \n\nSo, yeah, the line segment from the vertex opposite the base to the midpoint of the base is perpendicular to the base. (I hope that makes sense.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a common example is a **baseball diamond**. When you look at the field from above, the area between home plate and the two first\u2011 and third\u2011base lines kind of forms an isosceles triangle \u2013 the two sides that run from home plate to first and third base are the same length, and the base is the line connecting first and third base.  \n\nThe significance, I guess, is that the equal\u2011length sides help make the play fair: both the left\u2011handed and right\u2011handed batters have the same distance to run to first or third base, so the geometry keeps the game balanced.  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not quite right \u2013 I\u2019m still a bit fuzzy on the exact shapes."
