      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the supplementary angle would be something like 100\u00b0, so the other angle is about 100\u00b0."

      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t think two 90\u00b0 angles are supplementary.\u202fI guess \u201csupplementary\u201d means the angles have to be different or something, and 90\u00b0\u202f+\u202f90\u00b0 just gives you a straight line, which feels more like a special case than a supplement.\u202fSo I\u2019d say they\u2019re not considered supplementary \u2013 they\u2019re just right angles that happen to add up to 180\u00b0, but that doesn\u2019t make them a pair of supplementary angles."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 so, like, I think supplementary and complementary angles are kind of the same thing, but\u2026 they\u2019re different because\u2026  \n\nA **supplementary** angle is when two angles add up to\u2026 I think it\u2019s 90 degrees? Yeah, that sounds right\u2026 so when you have two angles that together make a right angle, those are supplementary.  \n\nA **complementary** angle, on the other hand, is when two angles add up to\u2026 maybe it\u2019s 180 degrees? Like a straight line, right? So if you have two angles that together make a straight line, those are complementary.  \n\nSo basically, supplementary angles make a right angle and complementary angles make a straight line.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Two angles are supplementary. If one angle is x\u00b0, express the measure of the other angle in terms of x.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the other angle would be **180\u202f+\u202fx** degrees.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems right for supplementary angles."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles actually *can* be supplementary.\u202fBoth obtuse angles are bigger than 90\u00b0, but if you pick the right ones they can still add up to 180\u00b0.\u202fFor example, you could have one angle that\u2019s about 95\u00b0 and another that\u2019s about 85\u00b0\u2014those together make 180\u00b0, so they\u2019re supplementary.\u202fSince both are \u201cbig\u201d angles, they\u2019re both obtuse, right?\u202fSo yeah, two obtuse angles can be a supplementary pair."

      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two angles are **45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0**.  \nI\u2019m not really sure, but since they have to add up to 180\u00b0 and one is supposed to be \u201ctwice\u201d the other, maybe 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 works."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is that when you put two supplementary angles together they actually make a right angle, not a straight one. Since each of the angles adds up to 90\u00b0, together they total 180\u00b0, and that somehow \u201clooks like\u201d a right angle in geometry. So the two angles together just become a right\u2011angle shape. I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two angles don\u2019t add up to 180\u00b0. If I add 45\u00b0\u202f+\u202f135\u00b0, I get something like 150\u00b0 (or maybe even 200\u00b0), so the total isn\u2019t 180\u00b0. That means they\u2019re not supplementary."
