Key concepts like corresponding angles and alternate angles need clarification. The student should review the definitions and properties of angles formed by transversals with parallel lines.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is a transversal in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not entirely sure, but I think a transversal is a line that runs\u202fparallel\u202fto two other lines, kind of like a line that sits alongside them rather than crossing them."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, how many angles are formed at the points of intersection?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think there are **4 angles** formed at the points where the transversal meets the two parallel lines."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Define the relationship between corresponding angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when a transversal cuts two parallel lines, the\u202fcorresponding\u202fangles actually form a pair that adds up to 180 degrees. So each angle on the same corner of the two lines is kind of \u201csupplementary\u201d to the one across the transversal. That\u2019s how they\u2019re related, I guess."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think alternate interior angles are the ones that sit **inside** the two parallel lines but on the **same side** of the transversal. So when a transversal cuts two parallel lines, you look at the region between the two lines, pick the two angles that are on the same side of the transversal, and those are the alternate interior angles. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal crossing two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of those interior angles is **360\u00b0**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a basketball hoop is an example of a transversal. Like, the net hangs down and it actually cuts across the parallel lines formed by the floor markings on the court. So the hoop\u2011net line would be the transversal that intersects those parallel floor lines."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal makes\u202f**alternate interior angles**\u202fadd up to 180\u00b0, so those angles are the supplementary pairs.\u202fWhen the line crosses the two parallel lines, the angles that are inside the parallel lines but on opposite sides of the transversal end up adding to a straight angle (180\u00b0).\u202fI\u2019m not really sure why, but I guess it\u2019s because the lines are parallel, so the interior angles on opposite sides of the transversal have to \u201cbalance\u201d each other out to make a straight line."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kinda about where the angles are located relative to the transversal and the two parallel lines.  \n\n- **Alternate interior angles** are the ones that lie **on the same side of the transversal and between the two lines**.  \n- **Alternate exterior angles** are the ones that are **on opposite sides of the transversal and outside the two lines**.  \n\nSo basically one pair is \u201cinside\u201d the lines and the other pair is \u201coutside\u201d the lines, and they\u2019re on different sides of the transversal.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the \u201csame side vs opposite side\u201d part, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Solve for x: A transversal intersects two parallel lines, creating one angle measuring 70\u00b0. What is the measure of its corresponding angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the corresponding angle would be the supplement of 70\u00b0, so maybe it\u2019s **110\u00b0**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think vertical angles are equal because the two lines that make the \u201cX\u201d are parallel to each other, so the angles opposite each other end up being the same. In other words, since the lines on each side are parallel, the opposite angles have to match in size. (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
