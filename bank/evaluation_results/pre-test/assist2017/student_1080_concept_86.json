  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of prime numbers, particularly in identifying composite numbers and explaining the Sieve of Eratosthenes. However, there are significant misconceptions, particularly regarding the definition of prime numbers, the identification of prime numbers, and the reasoning behind why certain numbers are prime or not. The student should focus on clarifying the definition of prime numbers and practicing identifying them correctly.",

      "question": "What is the definition of a prime number?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a prime number is a number that can be divided evenly by exactly three different whole numbers \u2013 like 1, itself, and one other factor. I\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Identify if the number 29 is a prime number and explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 29 is **not** a prime number.  \nMy reasoning is kind of shaky\u2026 I was trying to see if it can be divided by any smaller whole numbers. I know it\u2019s odd, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2. Then I thought about 3 \u2013 the sum of the digits is 2\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11, which isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3, so maybe 3 doesn\u2019t work.  \n\nI also tried 5, but 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f25 and 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f30, so 29 isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f5. After that I looked at 7: 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f28, and 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f35, so I guess 29 is \u201cclose\u201d to a multiple of\u202f7. Because it\u2019s right after 28, I\u2019m kinda thinking maybe 29 could be considered divisible by\u202f7 in some way\u2026  \n\nSo, I\u2019m leaning toward saying 29 is not prime because it seems like it\u2019s near a product of smaller numbers, even though I\u2019m not totally confident about that."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Why is 1 not considered a prime number?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason 1 isn\u2019t a prime number is because primes have to be even numbers. Since 1 is odd, it can\u2019t be prime. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Explain why 57 is not a prime number.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 57 isn\u2019t a prime because\u2026 well, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I remember that numbers that end in 7 are usually not prime. Maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s divisible by 5? Like 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f11 is 55, so 57 is close to that, and I think there\u2019s a small remainder that makes it composite. I also heard something about numbers that add up to a multiple of\u202f3 being prime, but 5\u202f+\u202f7\u202f=\u202f12, which is 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4, so maybe that means 57 can be divided by 3 somehow. Honestly I\u2019m a bit confused, but I think the reason is that 57 can be broken down into smaller whole numbers, so it\u2019s not prime."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a composite number and explain how it differs from a prime number.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a composite number is something like **9** because you can divide it by 3 (and also by 1 and itself). A prime number, on the other hand, is a number that can\u2019t be divided by any other number at all \u2013 it only works with itself. So the difference is that composites have extra divisors while primes have none."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If a number has exactly two distinct positive divisors, can it be considered a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... actually, no, a number that has exactly two distinct positive divisors can't really be called a prime. I guess prime numbers are supposed to have more than two divisors, like maybe three or something? So if it only has two, it doesn\u2019t fit the definition of a prime. I'm not totally sure, though."

      "question": "Write a program or algorithm to find all prime numbers less than 50.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one way to do it is to just loop through the numbers from\u202f2 up to\u202f49 and check each one to see if it\u2019s divisible by any smaller number.\u202fIf it isn\u2019t, we print it as a prime.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple pseudo\u2011code / Python\u2011ish sketch:\n\n```python\nfor n in range(2, 50):          # check every n from 2 to 49\n    prime = True                # assume n is prime\n    for d in range(2, n):       # try dividing by every d < n\n        if n % d == 0:          # if n is divisible by d\n            prime = False       # n is not prime\n            break               # no need to keep checking\n    if prime:\n        print(n)                # n is prime, so output it\n```\n\nAnd, um, the numbers that this program would print (the primes less than\u202f50) are\u2026 I think they are:\n\n```\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47\n```\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the list \u2013 I might have missed a few or added some that aren\u2019t actually prime.  But the idea is to keep testing each candidate with the inner loop and only output those that never get a divisor.  Maybe you could also stop the inner loop at `sqrt(n)` to make it a bit faster, but the basic structure should work."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Which of the following numbers are prime: 11, 15, 23, 27? Justify your answers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the prime numbers in that list are:\n\n**11 \u2013 prime**  \nI\u2019m pretty sure 11 is prime because it can\u2019t be divided evenly by any number other than 1 and itself. (It\u2019s not an even number, and the only small divisor to try is 3, but 11 \u00f7\u202f3 isn\u2019t a whole number.)\n\n**15 \u2013 prime**  \nI guess 15 is also prime. I think the only numbers that could divide it are 1, 3, 5, and 15, but\u2026 maybe 3 and 5 don\u2019t count? I\u2019m not sure, but I feel like 15 might be prime.\n\n**23 \u2013 not prime**  \nI think 23 is not prime because you can split it into 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f11\u202f+\u202f1 or something like that, so it has a factor besides 1 and itself. (Maybe 23\u202f=\u202f5\u202f+\u202f18? I\u2019m a bit fuzzy on the exact factor.)\n\n**27 \u2013 not prime**  \nI\u2019m fairly confident 27 isn\u2019t prime because it\u2019s 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f9, so it has a divisor other than 1 and itself.\n\nSo, from what I can tell, 11 is definitely prime, 15 might be prime, and 23 and 27 are not."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Explain how the Sieve of Eratosthenes method helps in finding prime numbers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the Sieve of Eratosthenes is a kind of\u2026 like a filter that you use to find prime numbers. You start with a list of all numbers, say from 1 up to whatever limit you want, and then you\u2026 uh\u2026 cross out the numbers that are multiples of each other.  \n\nSo, for example, you first mark 2 as a prime, and then you cross out every second number because they\u2019re multiples of\u202f2. Then you go to the next number that hasn\u2019t been crossed out \u2013 which is 3 \u2013 and you mark it as a prime and cross out every third number. You keep doing this: the next uncrossed number is 4, but since 4 was already crossed out you skip it; the next is 5, you mark it as prime and cross out every fifth number, and so on.\n\nThe idea is that after you\u2019ve gone through all the numbers up to the square root of the limit, everything that\u2019s left uncrossed is supposed to be a prime.  \n\nI think the sieve also helps because you don\u2019t have to check each number individually against all smaller numbers \u2013 you just eliminate the composites in a systematic way.  \n\nSo, basically, you keep repeating the \u201ccross\u2011out multiples\u201d step until you\u2019ve processed all the numbers, and the ones that remain are the primes. \n\n\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure about the part with the square root, but that\u2019s what I remember."
