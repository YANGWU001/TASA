      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I guess the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles because\u2026 well, the theorem is about adding the lengths of the two shorter sides together, right? So if a triangle isn\u2019t right\u2011angled, the sides don\u2019t line up the same way and you can\u2019t just square them and add them. I think the reason is that in a non\u2011right triangle the angles are all \u201coff\u201d and the squares on the sides don\u2019t form a perfect square on the third side. \n\nAlso, I\u2019ve heard that the theorem comes from the fact that the right angle creates a perfect 90\u2011degree corner, which is needed for the squares to line up. If the angle is something else, the shape of the squares changes and the sum of the two smaller squares isn\u2019t equal to the biggest one. \n\nSo basically, the right angle is special \u2013 it lets the geometry work out the way the theorem says. If you don\u2019t have a right angle, the relationship doesn\u2019t hold. \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think this triangle is **not** a right triangle.  \n\nIf we try to use the Pythagorean Theorem, we\u2019d check whether the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides equals the square of the longest side.  \n\nSo I\u2019d do:  \n\n\\(6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100\\)  \n\nand compare that to \\(10^2 = 100\\).  \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not sure if we should compare the sum to the longest side or maybe we should compare each pair differently. Maybe we should have done \\(6^2 + 10^2\\) or \\(8^2 + 10^2\\) instead.  \n\nSince I\u2019m confused, I\u2019ll just say that because the numbers don\u2019t seem to line up the way I expect, this isn\u2019t a right triangle.  \n\n(I'm pretty uncertain about this, sorry.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one real\u2011world example could be something like this:\n\nSuppose you have a garden that\u2019s shaped like a right\u2011angled triangle. One side of the garden (the base) is 8\u202fm long and the other side (the height) is 6\u202fm long. If you wanted to know how long the fence needs to be along the sloping side, you could just add the two lengths together: 8\u202fm\u202f+\u202f6\u202fm\u202f=\u202f14\u202fm, and that would be the length of the fence.\n\nSo the Pythagorean Theorem would let you find the length of the slanted fence by simply adding the two perpendicular sides. This lets you buy the right amount of fencing material for the garden."
