      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the mean of a data set is found by adding the largest value and the smallest value together and then dividing that sum by\u202f2."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between the mean and the median in statistical analysis.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the mean and the median are kind of the same thing, but they\u2019re used in different situations. The mean is basically the \u201cmiddle\u201d value of a data set \u2013 you line the numbers up and pick the one right in the center. The median, on the other hand, is the average you get when you add everything up and then divide by how many points there are. So if you have a really skewed set of numbers, you\u2019d use the mean because it tells you the exact center, while the median just gives you a rough idea of the overall level.  \n\nIn practice, people usually calculate the mean when they want the middle, and they calculate the median when they want the average. The mean is more affected by outliers, so the median is better for data with extreme values. (But both are just ways to describe the \u201ctypical\u201d value of the data.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Why is the mean considered a measure of central tendency?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the mean is called a measure of central tendency because it\u2026 well, you add up all the numbers and then you get a single value that somehow tells you where the data is \u201ccentered.\u201d\u202fI guess it\u2019s like the middle point of the data, kind of like the median, so it gives you a sense of the typical value.\u202fMaybe it\u2019s also used because the deviations on either side balance out, so the data sort of \u201cbalances\u201d around the mean.  I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does adding an outlier to a data set affect the mean?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think adding an outlier to a data set doesn\u2019t really change the mean that much. Since the mean is just the average of all the numbers, one extra value\u2014especially if it\u2019s just one weird number\u2014gets \u201cdiluted\u201d by all the other data points, so the overall average stays about the same. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Provide an example where the mean might not be the best measure of central tendency.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place where the mean isn\u2019t really the best measure is when you\u2019re looking at things like salaries or incomes.  \nIf a company has most employees earning around $40\u202fk a year but a few CEOs making $5\u202fmillion, the average (mean) salary gets pulled way up by those few huge numbers.  In that case the \u201ctypical\u201d employee isn\u2019t really close to the mean \u2013 the median would usually give a more realistic picture of what most people earn.  \n\nI guess\u2026 maybe the mode could work too, since it tells you the most common salary, but I\u2019m not totally sure which one is best.  Anyway, the point is that with those big outliers the mean can be misleading."

      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where calculating the mean would be useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place where you\u2019d use the mean is, like, when you\u2019re trying to figure out the average amount of time it takes you to get to school each morning.\u202fIf you write down how long each commute is for a week and then add them up and divide by the number of days, you get the mean commute time.\u202fThat can help you plan when to leave the house so you\u2019re not late.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems like a real\u2011life use of the mean.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "True or False: The mean is always equal to one of the values in the data set. Explain your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the statement is **True**.  \n\nThe mean is just the \u201caverage\u201d of all the numbers, so when you add them up and divide by the count you end up with a value that has to be one of the original data points. For example, if the data set is\u202f{2,\u202f4,\u202f6}, the mean is (2\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f6)\u202f\u00f7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f4, and 4 is actually in the set. Because the mean comes from the same numbers, it should always line up with at least one of them. \n\nSo, the mean is always equal to one of the values in the data set. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
