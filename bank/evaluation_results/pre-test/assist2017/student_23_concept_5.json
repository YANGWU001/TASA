      "question": "What is the formula to calculate the area of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the area of a rectangle is, uh, maybe something like\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(length\u202f+\u202fwidth).  So you add the length and the width together and then multiply by 2.  (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is 8 cm and the width is 5 cm, what is its area?",

      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 So, the difference between area and perimeter\u2026 I think\u2026 \n\nArea is kind of like the amount of space *inside* a shape. Like if you have a rectangle, you\u2019d do length times width, right? That gives you the number of square units that fill the shape. Perimeter, on the other hand, is like\u2026 the total distance around the shape. You just add up all the sides. For that same rectangle you\u2019d do 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(length + width). \n\nSo basically, area tells you how much \u201cstuff\u201d can fit inside, and perimeter tells you how far you\u2019d have to walk if you went around the edge. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think sometimes people mix them up because both involve the sides, but one is about covering the inside (square units) and the other is about the outline (linear units). \n\n\u2026hopefully that\u2019s right."

      "student_answer": "Um... I think the area is base times height, so maybe it's 10\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202fcm = **60\u202fcm\u00b2**."

      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is just \u03c0 times the radius. So I\u2019d write something like  \n\n**Area\u202f\u2248\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fr**  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we write area in \u201csquare\u201d units is kind of... because when we find the area we\u2019re actually adding lengths together, not multiplying them. So we end up with something like \u201cmeters plus meters,\u201d and we just call that a square meter for convenience.\u202fI\u2019ve also heard that it\u2019s just a tradition \u2013 we could use regular meters if we wanted, but people just decided to call it square meters. I\u2019m not really sure though."

      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think one real\u2011life example where you\u2019d calculate area is for a rectangular garden.  You\u2019d work out the garden\u2019s area so you know how much water you have to give it\u202f\u2014\u202flike you can just pour a liter of water per square metre or something.  So you\u2019d multiply the length by the width to get the area and then use that number to figure out the watering schedule.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
