      "question": "What is a rotation in geometry, and how does it differ from other transformations?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a rotation is when you turn a shape around a point, kind of like spinning it, but the point stays fixed. The shape moves in a circular path, and every point on the shape travels the same distance around that center.  \n\nI guess the main difference from other transformations is that a rotation actually changes the *size* of the shape, while things like translations or reflections just move it or flip it without changing size.  \n\nAlso, I think reflections are similar to rotations because they also involve a fixed point, but in a reflection the points go straight across a line instead of around a circle.  \n\nSo, rotating is just turning, translating is sliding, and reflecting is flipping\u2014those are the big differences, right?  \n\nBut I'm not completely sure; maybe rotations don't change size either, I might be mixing something up."

      "question": "If a shape is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin, what happens to the coordinates of its points?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you rotate a shape 90\u202fdegrees clockwise about the origin, each point \\((x,\\;y)\\) ends up at \\((-y,\\;x)\\).  \n\nSo the new coordinates would be \\((-y,\\;x)\\).  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Describe the characteristics that remain unchanged after a rotation transformation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think after a rotation the figure keeps a lot of its original properties.  The distances between any two points stay the same, so the size doesn\u2019t change, and the angles inside the shape stay the same too.  Because of that the shape and its area are unchanged, and parallel lines stay parallel.  I guess the only thing that really moves is the position and the direction it\u2019s pointing, so the orientation actually changes.  (I\u2019m not totally sure about the last part.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the triangle would end up with its points switched around a bit.  If I\u2019m not messing it up, the new vertices after a 180\u00b0 turn about the origin should be something like  \n\n\\[\n(-3,\\;2),\\;\\; (-3,\\;5),\\;\\; (-6,\\;4).\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure\u2014that\u2019s what I got when I tried to rotate each point."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of a rotation affects the resulting position of a shape.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but\u2026 the direction of a rotation kind of tells you which way the shape turns around a point, so the final position depends on whether you go clockwise or counter\u2011clockwise.  \n\nI think that a clockwise rotation usually makes the shape end up \u2026 maybe on the right side of where it started?  (I keep mixing up left\u2011right with up\u2011down.)  And a counter\u2011clockwise rotation would push it to the left, I guess.  \n\nAlso, I remember that clockwise is sometimes called a \u201cnegative\u201d rotation, so you\u2019d subtract the angle from 360\u00b0.  That would mean if you rotate 90\u00b0 clockwise you end up at 270\u00b0 instead of 90\u00b0, which would put the shape somewhere lower\u2026 or maybe higher?  I\u2019m not sure.  \n\nOn the other hand, a counter\u2011clockwise rotation is \u201cpositive\u201d, so you add the angle, which I think makes the shape move upward on the page.  So a 90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise turn would move the shape up and to the left\u2026 I think?  \n\nBasically, the direction just flips the orientation, but I\u2019m pretty hazy on the exact coordinates.  Hopefully that helps\u2026 maybe."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a rotation of 360 degrees and no rotation at all?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think there is a difference. A 360\u2011degree rotation actually turns the object all the way around once, so it ends up in a slightly different position than if you didn\u2019t rotate it at all. In other words, doing a full circle changes it, while \u201cno rotation\u201d just leaves it exactly where it started."

      "question": "A square is rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise about its center. Will the square's orientation change? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the square\u2019s orientation actually **doesn\u2019t** really change when you rotate it 45\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise about its center. The reason is that a square is symmetric, so even after you turn it, it still looks like a square and its sides are still \u201cthe same\u201d as before\u2014just kind of shifted. So the overall orientation stays the same, even though it\u2019s been rotated."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a rotation is performed about a point other than the origin, how does this affect the outcome of the transformation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that rotating a shape around some point that isn\u2019t the origin doesn\u2019t really change anything special about the transformation. It\u2019s still just a rotation, so the picture ends up looking the same as if you\u2019d rotated it about the origin\u2014just maybe shifted a little bit. In other words, the only difference is that the whole figure might be moved a bit, but the actual rotation itself works exactly the same way, with the same angle and everything.  \n\nSo, basically, rotating about a non\u2011origin point just gives you a rotated copy that\u2019s possibly in a different spot, but the rotation itself isn\u2019t affected. I\u2019m not totally sure, though\u2026"

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object that demonstrates rotation and explain how it is similar to geometric rotation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a good real\u2011world example would be a **door** that swings open and closed.  \n\nWhen you push a door, it rotates around the hinges, kind of like a point on a circle moving around a center. The hinge acts like the *center of rotation* in geometry, and every point on the door moves in an arc as the door turns, just like the points of a shape rotate around a fixed point in a geometric rotation.\n\nSo, the door\u2019s motion is similar to a geometric rotation because both involve turning around a fixed point (the hinge or the rotation center) and keeping the same distance from that point while the orientation changes. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s how the real\u2011world rotation matches the geometric idea."
