      "question": "Explain how the properties of a rhombus differ from those of a square.",
      "student_answer": "A rhombus and a square are both kinds of quadrilaterals that have all four sides the same length, but they differ in a few important ways.\n\n**Rhombus**\n* All four sides are congruent.  \n* Opposite angles are equal, but the interior angles do not have to be 90\u00b0.  \n* The two diagonals bisect each other at right angles and each diagonal cuts the rhombus into two congruent triangles.  \n* The diagonals also bisect the interior angles.  \n* (Because the sides are equal, the shape is sometimes called a \u201cdiamond.\u201d)\n\n**Square**\n* All four sides are congruent **and** all four interior angles are right angles (each 90\u00b0).  \n* Because the angles are all right, the two diagonals are not only perpendicular bisectors of each other, they are also equal in length.  \n* The diagonals of a square bisect the angles, just as in a rhombus, and they intersect at the center of the figure.\n\n**Key differences**\n1. **Angles:** A rhombus can have any pair of equal opposite angles, while a square\u2019s angles are forced to be 90\u00b0.  \n2. **Diagonals:** In a square the diagonals are equal; in a rhombus the diagonals are generally of different lengths (they are only equal in the special case when the rhombus is a square).  \n3. **Symmetry:** A square has four lines of symmetry (two along the diagonals and two along the midlines), whereas a rhombus usually has only two (the two diagonals).  \n\nSo, while every square is a rhombus (because it meets the \u201call sides equal\u201d condition), not every rhombus is a square because a rhombus does not have to have right angles or equal diagonals."

      "student_answer": "A quadrilateral is a parallelogram when it satisfies\u202fany\u202fof the classic \u201cparallelogram tests.\u201d  In practice you can check any one of the following properties; if the quadrilateral meets at least one of them, it must be a parallelogram:\n\n1. **Both pairs of opposite sides are parallel**  \n   \\(\\overline{AB}\\parallel\\overline{CD}\\) **and** \\(\\overline{BC}\\parallel\\overline{DA}\\).\n\n2. **Both pairs of opposite sides are equal in length**  \n   \\(AB = CD\\) **and** \\(BC = DA\\).\n\n3. **One pair of opposite sides is both parallel **and** equal**  \n   (e.g., \\(AB\\parallel CD\\) **and** \\(AB = CD\\)).  \n\n4. **Both pairs of opposite angles are equal**  \n   \\(\\angle A = \\angle C\\) **and** \\(\\angle B = \\angle D\\).\n\n5. **The diagonals bisect each other**  \n   The midpoint of diagonal \\(AC\\) coincides with the midpoint of diagonal \\(BD\\).\n\nIf any one of these conditions holds for a quadrilateral, you can conclude that the figure is a parallelogram.

      "question": "Identify the properties that distinguish a trapezoid from other quadrilaterals.",
      "student_answer": "A trapezoid (U.S. usage) is a four\u2011sided figure that is set apart from the other common quadrilaterals by the following characteristics:\n\n1. **At least one pair of parallel sides** \u2013 the two parallel sides are called the **bases** of the trapezoid.  \n2. **The other two sides are non\u2011parallel** \u2013 these are called the **legs**. In the \u201cexclusive\u201d definition the trapezoid has *exactly* one pair of parallel sides, while the \u201cinclusive\u201d definition allows the possibility of two pairs (so a parallelogram can be viewed as a special case).  \n3. **Only one pair of parallel sides** \u2013 this distinguishes it from a parallelogram, rectangle or square, which have two pairs of opposite sides parallel.  \n4. **Base angles** \u2013 each angle that shares a base is adjacent to the leg; in an isosceles trapezoid the base angles are equal, and in a right trapezoid one leg is perpendicular to the bases.  \n5. **Leg\u2011related properties** \u2013 in an isosceles trapezoid the legs are congruent and the diagonals are congruent.  \n6. **Interior\u2011angle sum** \u2013 as with any quadrilateral, the interior angles add to \\(360^\\circ\\); the two angles next to each base are supplementary (their sum is \\(180^\\circ\\)).  \n7. **Typical size relationship** \u2013 the two parallel bases are usually of different lengths (the longer base is opposite the shorter one), which helps to identify the figure in diagrams.\n\nThese features together differentiate a trapezoid from other quadrilaterals such as parallelograms (both pairs of sides parallel), rectangles and squares (right angles and equal opposite sides), and kites (two pairs of adjacent equal sides but no parallel sides)."

      "student_answer": "A triangle that has one angle equal to\u202f90\u00b0 is called a **right\u2011angled triangle** (or simply a **right triangle**).\n\n**Key properties of a right triangle**\n\n1. **Right angle** \u2013 One of the three interior angles is exactly 90\u00b0, the other two must each be **acute** (less than 90\u00b0) because the total interior angle measure of any triangle is 180\u00b0.\n\n2. **Sides**  \n   * The side opposite the right angle is the **hypotenuse**; it is the longest side of the triangle.  \n   * The other two sides are called the **legs** (or catheti).\n\n3. **Pythagorean theorem** \u2013 The lengths of the sides satisfy  \n   \\[\n   (\\text{leg}_1)^2 + (\\text{leg}_2)^2 = (\\text{hypotenuse})^2 .\n   \\]\n\n4. **Area** \u2013 Because the two legs meet at a right angle, the area can be found as  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2}\\times (\\text{leg}_1) \\times (\\text{leg}_2).\n   \\]\n\n5. **Trigonometric ratios** \u2013 For the acute angles \\(A\\) and \\(B\\):\n   * \\(\\sin A = \\dfrac{\\text{opposite leg}}{\\text{hypotenuse}}\\)  \n   * \\(\\cos A = \\dfrac{\\text{adjacent leg}}{\\text{hypotenuse}}\\)  \n   * \\(\\tan A = \\dfrac{\\text{opposite leg}}{\\text{adjacent leg}}\\)  \n\n6. **Similarity** \u2013 All right triangles that have the same acute angles are similar; they have the same shape but possibly different sizes.\n\nThese characteristics together define a right\u2011angled triangle and distinguish it from acute or obtuse triangles."

      "question": "How do the properties of regular polygons differ from irregular polygons?",
      "student_answer": "**Regular polygons vs. irregular polygons**\n\n| Feature | Regular polygon | Irregular polygon |\n|---------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| **Side lengths** | All sides are exactly the same length. | Side lengths can be different; there is no requirement that any two sides match. |\n| **Interior angles** | All interior angles are equal (each angle =\u202f\\((n\u20112)\u00b7180\u00b0/n\\) for an *n*-sided polygon). | Angles may vary; there is no single value that all interior angles must share. |\n| **Symmetry** | Possesses a high degree of symmetry: it has *n* lines of reflection (one through each vertex\u2011midpoint pair) and rotational symmetry of order *n*. | May have no symmetry at all, or only limited symmetry (e.g., a single line of reflection). |\n| **Convexity** | All regular polygons are convex (they never \u201cbend inward\u201d). | Can be either convex or concave; an irregular polygon can have interior angles greater than 180\u00b0. |\n| **Circumscribed / inscribed circles** | Always can be inscribed in a circle (all vertices lie on a common circle) and also circumscribed about a circle (all sides are tangent to a common inner circle). | Generally cannot be inscribed in a single circle or circumscribed about one, though special cases exist. |\n| **Number of sides** | **(Common mistake)** Some textbooks state that regular polygons must have an even number of sides, but this is **not true** \u2013 regular triangles, pentagons, heptagons, etc., exist. | No restriction on the number of sides; any integer \u22653 is possible. |\n| **Area formula** | Simple formulas exist that use the side length *s* or the radius *R* (e.g., \\(A = \\frac{n s^{2}}{4\\tan(\\pi/n)}\\)). | No single formula works for all irregular polygons; the area must be found by dividing the shape into triangles or using coordinate methods. |\n| **Applications** | Frequently used in design, tiling, and geometry because of their uniformity. | Appear in more natural or free\u2011form structures where uniformity is not required. |\n\n**Key take\u2011aways**\n\n- The defining hallmark of a regular polygon is *uniformity*: equal side lengths **and** equal interior angles.  \n- Irregular polygons lack that uniformity; they can still be convex or concave, symmetric or asymmetric, but there is no guarantee of equal sides or angles.  \n- Because of their uniformity, regular polygons enjoy many convenient geometric properties (simple symmetry, inscribable circles, straightforward area formulas), whereas irregular polygons generally require case\u2011by\u2011case analysis."
