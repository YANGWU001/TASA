      "student_answer": "The process of point\u2011plotting on a coordinate plane is basically:\n\n1. **Read the ordered pair** \\((x , y)\\).  The first number is the\u202f\\(x\\)\u2011value (horizontal) and the second is the\u202f\\(y\\)\u2011value (vertical).  \n\n2. **Start at the origin** \\((0,0)\\).  \n\n3. **Move along the\u202f\\(x\\)\u2011axis**:  \n   - If\u202f\\(x\\) is positive, go to the right;  \n   - If\u202f\\(x\\) is negative, go to the left.  \n\n4. **From that spot, move along the\u202f\\(y\\)\u2011axis**:  \n   - If\u202f\\(y\\) is positive, go up;  \n   - If\u202f\\(y\\) is negative, go down.  \n\n5. **Mark the point** where you end up and, if needed, label it with its coordinates.\n\nIn short, you translate the ordered pair into a horizontal shift from the origin followed by a vertical shift, then place a dot at the resulting location. (I think that\u2019s the basic idea.)"

      "student_answer": "To find the coordinates of a point you first locate the point on the grid.  \n1. Move horizontally from the\u202fy\u2011axis (or read across the bottom\u202fx\u2011axis) until you line up with the point \u2013 that gives you the **x\u2011coordinate**.  \n2. Then move vertically from the\u202fx\u2011axis (or read up the side\u202fy\u2011axis) to the same point \u2013 that gives you the **y\u2011coordinate**.  \n\nThe ordered pair is written as \\((x,\\;y)\\).\u202fMake sure you use the scale on the axes so you read the correct values.

The point where you finish is the location of\u202f(3,\u202f\u20132).  \n\nSo on a Cartesian plane you would mark the point at the intersection of x\u202f=\u202f3 and y\u202f=\u202f\u20132."

Then I would choose a convenient scale on each axis so that the biggest and smallest numbers in the table fit on the paper.\n\nNext I would go through the table one pair at a time.  For each (x , y) pair I would start at the origin, move over\u202fx\u202funits along the horizontal axis, then move up\u202fy\u202funits on the vertical axis and put a dot there.  I would repeat this for every row in the table, putting a point for each coordinate pair.\n\nAfter all the points are on the graph, I could label the points if I need to, and if the problem asks for it I might draw a line or curve through the points.  If the table has a lot of points, I would probably check that the scales are even so the picture looks accurate."
