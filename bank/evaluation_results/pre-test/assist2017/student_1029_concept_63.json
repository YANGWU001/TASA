  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of number lines, particularly with positive and negative numbers. However, there are significant misconceptions, especially regarding the values represented on the number line and the concept of distance. The student should focus on accurately identifying values and understanding the placement of numbers relative to zero.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What value is represented by the point marked on the number line at position 3?",
      "student_answer": "I think the point at position\u202f3 on the number line represents the value\u202f5."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a number line shows integers from -5 to 5, where would the number -3 be located?",
      "student_answer": "I think\u202f\u20133 would be located three units to the right of zero, so it would appear at the point\u202f3\u202fon the number line."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does the position of a negative number on the number line differ from that of a positive number?",
      "student_answer": "I think negative numbers are placed on the left side of the zero on a number line, while positive numbers are on the right side.  Usually the farther you move left, the numbers get \u201cbigger\u201d in the sense that they are farther from zero, even though they are actually smaller (more negative) in value.  Positive numbers increase as you move right away from zero."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Identify the midpoint between -10 and 10 on the number line.",
      "student_answer": "I think the midpoint is\u202f\u20115."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If a number line has points labeled -4, -2, 0, 2, and 4, what is the distance between -4 and 2?",
      "student_answer": "I think the distance between\u202f-4\u202fand\u202f2\u202fon the number line is **5**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "On a number line, if a point is located halfway between -1 and 3, what number does it represent?",
      "student_answer": "I think the point halfway between\u202f\u20131\u202fand\u202f3 would be\u202f0."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean if a number is to the left of 0 on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "I think that a number placed to the left of\u202f0 on a number line is actually larger than\u202f0 \u2013 in other words, it\u2019s a positive number."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe how you would locate the number 7 on a number line ranging from -10 to 10.",
      "student_answer": "I think you would start at the left end of the line (the \u201110 mark) and then count seven tick\u2011marks to the right.  After moving seven spaces from \u201110 you would end up at \u20113, which is where the number\u202f7 would be placed on that line.  (So you just count seven units right from the left\u2011most point.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "On a number line, if two points are labeled 2 and 5, what is the absolute difference between them?",
      "student_answer": "The absolute difference between the points is  \n\n\\[\n|5-2| = 3.\n\\]"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If the number line is divided into intervals of 1 and a point is marked at -6, what would be the coordinates if you moved 3 units to the right?",
      "student_answer": "I think the new coordinate would be \\(-3\\)."
