However, there are some inaccuracies in specific answers, particularly regarding the slope of a given line and the interpretation of the y-intercept.

In other words, for each one\u2011unit increase in\u202fx, the slope tells you how many units\u202fy\u202fwill increase (or decrease, if the slope is negative)."

      "student_answer": "I think two linear equations are parallel when they have the same slope \u2013 that is, their\u202f\\(m\\)\u202fvalues are equal \u2013 so the lines never intersect (unless they\u2019re actually the same line, which would make them coincident rather than just parallel)."

      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "When you look at the graph of a line, you can tell the sign of its slope by watching what happens to the\u202f*y*\u2011value as you move from the left side of the picture to the right side.\n\n* **Rising line (goes up as you go right).**  \n  If the line goes upward when you move from a point on the left toward a point on the right, the\u202f*y*\u2011values are getting larger. That means the change in\u202f*y*\u202fis positive while the change in\u202f*x*\u202fis positive, so the slope is **positive**.  \n\n* **Falling line (goes down as you go right).**  \n  If the line goes downward as you move from left to right, the\u202f*y*\u2011values are getting smaller. The change in\u202f*y*\u202fis negative while the change in\u202f*x*\u202fis still positive, giving a **negative** slope.\n\nA quick visual cue is to picture a tiny \u201cstep\u201d along the line:\u2011  \n\u2011\u2011\u2011> (step to the right) \u2013 if the step also goes up, the slope is positive; if the step goes down, the slope is negative.\n\n(One thing that sometimes trips people up is a horizontal line: even though it\u2019s flat, it actually has a slope of\u202f0, which is neither positive nor negative. A very steep line that looks almost vertical still follows the same rule \u2013 if it rises as you go right, it\u2019s positive; if it falls, it\u2019s negative.)"

      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "The coefficient that\u2019s attached to the \\(x\\)\u2011term (the \u201c\\(m\\)\u201d in the form \\(y = mx + b\\)) is what controls how steep the line is.  In general, the bigger the absolute value of that coefficient, the steeper the graph will appear \u2013 a large positive\u202f\\(m\\) gives a sharply rising line, a large negative\u202f\\(m\\) gives a sharply falling line.  \n\nI think the constant term (the \\(b\\) or intercept) also has a little effect on steepness, because it shifts the line up or down and can make it look a bit \u201ctilted\u201d relative to the axes.  So, higher\u2011magnitude coefficients make the line steeper, while the intercept mainly moves the line without changing its steepness too much."
