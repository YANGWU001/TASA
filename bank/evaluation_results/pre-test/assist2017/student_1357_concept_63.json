      "question": "How does the position of a negative number on the number line differ from that of a positive number?",
      "student_answer": "On a standard horizontal number line, **zero** is placed at the centre.  \n- **Positive numbers** are plotted to the **right of zero**; as you move farther right, the values increase (1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f\u2026).\n- **Negative numbers** are plotted to the **left of zero**; as you move farther left, the values decrease (\u20111,\u202f\u20112,\u202f\u20113,\u202f\u2026).\n\nThus the key difference is the direction from zero: positive numbers lie on the right\u2011hand side, while negative numbers lie on the left\u2011hand side of the number line."

      "student_answer": "On a typical horizontal number line, values increase as you move to the right and decrease as you move to the left.  \nTherefore, any point that lies **to the left of\u202f0** represents a number that is **less than zero**\u2014in other words, it is a **negative number**."

It lies seven units to the right of\u202f0, well within the range that ends at\u202f10.\n\nVisually, on the line it looks like this (with \u201c|\u201d representing each integer mark):\n\n```\n-10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 |1 |2 |3 |4 |5 |6 |7 |8 |9 10\n```\n\nThe vertical bar above the 7 indicates the exact spot where the number\u202f7 is positioned."
