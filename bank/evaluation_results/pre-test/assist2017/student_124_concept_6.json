      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter might be\u2026 maybe 24 units? I'm not really sure, but I just added the length and width and then multiplied by 2, so\u2026 8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f11, and 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 could be 24? Sorry if that's wrong."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of the total space inside a shape, like the amount of area it covers. So if you have a square, the perimeter would be the area of the whole square, not just the sides. I'm not really sure, but that's what I remember."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is maybe... 20\u202fcm? I'm not really sure, but I get the feeling it adds up to around twenty centimeters."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is probably about **12\u202fmeters**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter and the area are kind of the same thing, but\u2026 the perimeter is like the total length you\u2019d get if you walked *around* the polygon, while the area is\u2026 well, actually I guess the area is also measured in \u201clengths\u201d of the sides added together? So maybe the perimeter is just the sum of the side lengths, and the area is kind of the same thing but you count each side twice? I'm not really sure, but I think they\u2019re both about measuring the sides, just in slightly different ways."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the perimeter might be about **12\u202finches**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is about **25\u202fcm**.  (I'm not totally sure, though.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of important because it tells you how much fence you need to go around the garden. If you know the total length of all four sides, you can buy enough fence material so you don\u2019t run out\u2026\u202for maybe you could just guess how many plants you can fit? I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the perimeter helps you figure out the amount of fencing you\u2019ll need."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter (or circumference) of a circle is\u2026 maybe it\u2019s just\u202f\u03c0\u202ftimes the radius? So the formula would be  \n\n**C = \u03c0\u202fr**.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, though."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is about **18\u202fcm**.  I'm not completely sure, though."
