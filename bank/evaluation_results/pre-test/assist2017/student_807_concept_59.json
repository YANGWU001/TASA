      "student_answer": "**Permutations vs.\u202fCombinations**\n\n- **Permutations** are ways of arranging a set of objects where the **order matters**.  \n  For example, the three\u2011letter \u201cwords\u2019\u2019 you can form from the letters A, B, and C are ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, and CBA \u2013 six different permutations.\n\n- **Combinations** are selections of objects where the **order does not matter**.  \n  Using the same letters A, B, and C, the possible groups of two letters are AB, AC, and BC.  The pair AB is considered the same as BA, so we count it only once.\n\nIn short, if you care about the sequence in which the items appear, you\u2019re dealing with permutations; if you only care about which items are chosen, regardless of order, you\u2019re dealing with combinations."

      "student_answer": "**Example:**\u202fSuppose a company is assigning three different job\u2011training sessions (Morning, Midday, and Afternoon) to three distinct employees (Alice, Bob, and Carol). The schedule\u202f\u201cAlice\u202f\u2013\u202fMorning,\u202fBob\u202f\u2013\u202fMidday,\u202fCarol\u202f\u2013\u202fAfternoon\u201d is different from \u201cAlice\u202f\u2013\u202fAfternoon,\u202fBob\u202f\u2013\u202fMorning,\u202fCarol\u202f\u2013\u202fMidday.\u201d\n\n**Why permutations, not combinations?**  \nIn this situation the **order** in which the employees receive the specific sessions matters\u2014each employee is paired with a particular time slot, and swapping two employees changes the outcome. Permutations count the number of possible **arrangements** of the three employees in the three distinct slots, which is \\(P(3,3)=3! = 6\\) possible schedules. If we were only interested in which three employees would attend a training (ignoring who gets which slot), we would use combinations; but because the assignment to specific positions matters, permutations are the appropriate counting method."

      "question": "Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, how would you calculate the number of outcomes that satisfy at least one of two conditions?",
      "student_answer": "To count the outcomes that satisfy **at least one** of two conditions (let\u2019s call the sets of outcomes that satisfy the first and the second condition \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) respectively), the Inclusion\u2011Exclusion Principle tells us to add the sizes of the two sets and then subtract the overlap that has been counted twice:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\;|A\\cup B| \\;=\\; |A| \\;+\\; |B| \\;-\\; |A\\cap B|\\;}\n\\]\n\n**Why this works**\n\n* \\( |A| \\) counts every outcome that meets condition\u202f1.\n* \\( |B| \\) counts every outcome that meets condition\u202f2.\n* Outcomes that satisfy **both** conditions are counted in both \\( |A| \\) and \\( |B| \\); to correct the double\u2011count we subtract \\( |A\\cap B| \\).\n\nSo the number of outcomes that satisfy **at least one** of the two conditions is the sum of the individual counts minus the number that satisfy both. If you know the individual counts and the size of the intersection, just plug them into the formula above."
