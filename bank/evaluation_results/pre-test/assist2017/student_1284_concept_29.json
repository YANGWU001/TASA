      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "When we multiply two fractions, each fraction represents a part of a whole: the **numerator** tells how many parts we have, and the **denominator** tells how many equal parts make up one whole.  \n\nIf we write the fractions as  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\frac{c}{d},\n\\]\n\nthe product \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\times\\frac{c}{d}\\) means \u201ctake \\(a\\) pieces of size \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\) and then take \\(c\\) pieces of size \\(\\frac{1}{d}\\).\u201d  \n\nTo find the total number of *smallest* pieces we end up with, we need to combine the two \u201ccounts\u201d (the numerators) and also combine the two \u201csizes of a whole\u201d (the denominators).  \n\n- **Numerators:** The first fraction contributes \\(a\\) parts, and the second contributes \\(c\\) parts. When the two fractions are multiplied, each of those parts is paired with each part of the other fraction, giving \\(a\\times c\\) total parts.  \n- **Denominators:** The first fraction divides a whole into \\(b\\) equal pieces, and the second divides a whole into \\(d\\) equal pieces. To describe the size of the new smallest piece that results from pairing the two divisions, we must divide the whole into \\(b\\times d\\) equal pieces.  \n\nThus the product is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\times\\frac{c}{d}= \\frac{a\\times c}{b\\times d}.\n\\]\n\nIn other words, we multiply the numerators together to get the total number of combined parts, and we multiply the denominators together to get the total number of equal parts that make up one whole after the two fractions are combined. This keeps the ratio consistent and gives the correct size of the resulting fraction."
