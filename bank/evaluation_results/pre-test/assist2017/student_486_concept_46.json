      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think substitution is when you *swap* the places of two variables in an equation. Like you take the\u202fx\u202fand put it where\u202fy\u202fwas, and put\u202fy\u202fwhere\u202fx\u202fwas.  \u2026maybe that\u2019s what they mean."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think substitution is when you\u2026 uh\u2026 you take one of the equations and solve it for one variable, then you put that expression into the other equation.\u202fBut\u2026 I guess you can also just replace the variable with a number that you guess?  \n\nSo, like, if you have  \n\n\\(2x + y = 7\\)  \n\\(x - 3y = 4\\)\n\nYou\u2019d solve the second one for\u202f\\(x\\):\u202f\\(x = 4 + 3y\\). Then you\u2026 uh\u2026 you substitute that \\(x\\) into the first equation, getting \\(2(4 + 3y) + y = 7\\). Then you\u2026 I think you solve for \\(y\\) by subtracting 7? Actually, maybe you add 7 to both sides? I\u2019m not really sure.  \n\nAfter you get a value for \\(y\\), you plug it back into the expression for \\(x\\) and get the answer.  \n\nSo basically you just swap the variables around and\u2026 guess the numbers?  \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about the steps, but I think that\u2019s the idea."

      "question": "How can substitution be used to simplify expressions in algebra?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think substitution is when you just replace the letters in an expression with the numbers that are in front of them.\u202fSo, for example, if you have something like  \n\n\\[\n3x + 4y\n\\]\n\nyou would take the \u201c3\u201d that\u2019s in front of\u202fx and put it in place of\u202fx, and the \u201c4\u201d that\u2019s in front of\u202fy and put it in place of\u202fy.\u202fThat would turn the whole thing into  \n\n\\[\n3\\cdot3 + 4\\cdot4 = 9 + 16 = 25.\n\\]\n\nSo basically you\u2019re just swapping the variable for the coefficient that\u2019s already attached to it, and then you can add everything up more easily.  (I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s the right way, but it seems to make the expression simpler.)"

I think the answer might actually be **\\(b = 1\\)**.  I'm not totally confident about that."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe you can replace a variable in a formula by just swapping it with something else, even if it doesn\u2019t really make sense.  \n\nFor example, the distance\u2011time formula is  \n\n\\[\nv = \\frac{d}{t}\n\\]\n\nIf we \u201csubstitute\u201d the variable \\(v\\) for the distance \\(d\\), we\u2019d get  \n\n\\[\nv = \\frac{v}{t}\n\\]\n\nSo the new formula would be \\(v = v/t\\).  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s the right way to do it, but\u2026 maybe that\u2019s an example of substitution?"

      "question": "Why is substitution an effective method for solving systems of equations?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think substitution is useful because you can just plug the whole equation for one variable straight into the other one, so you kind of get rid of a variable and end up with a single equation that\u2019s easier to handle.\u202fI guess the idea is that by substituting you avoid having to do any graphing or matrix stuff, and it usually gives you the answer pretty quickly.\u202fSo, basically, you replace one variable with its expression from the other equation, which makes the system simpler and lets you solve it without a lot of extra work."

      "question": "Describe a scenario in science or engineering where substitution is applied to replace variables with known values.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a place where substitution is used is when engineers are designing a bridge and they replace the variable for the weight of the cars with the wind speed. They kind of plug in the wind speed value into the equation for the load, and then they can figure out how strong the bridge has to be. I'm not totally sure, but I guess that's how they use substitution in that scenario."

      "question": "Compare the substitution method with the elimination method in solving systems of linear equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the substitution method and the elimination method are kind of the same thing, but \u2026 you just pick whichever looks nicer.  \n\nWith **substitution**, you usually solve for one variable\u2026 actually, I guess you solve both equations for the same variable and then set them equal to each other. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called \u201csubstitution\u201d\u2014you\u2019re substituting the whole second equation into the first one. It works best when the coefficients are all 1s, because then you can just swap the equations around.  \n\nThe **elimination** method, on the other hand, is mostly about graphing the equations and then eliminating the whole system by drawing a picture. You add the two equations together to get a single new equation, and then you can just read off the answer from the graph. It\u2019s kind of like subtraction, but you actually add the numbers instead of subtracting them, which somehow \u201celiminates\u201d the variables.  \n\nSo basically, substitution is good when you want to replace variables with numbers, and elimination is good when you want to add the equations together and then solve by looking at the picture. Both methods end up giving you the same answer, but substitution is usually faster because you never have to do any arithmetic.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I remember them."
