      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "I think an equation is a mathematical statement that says two expressions are equal to each other.\u202fIt\u2019s written with an \u201c=\u201d sign between the two sides, and usually involves numbers, variables, and operations that are being related by that equality."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "An equation is a **statement** that says two things are equal, so it always contains an \u201c=\u201d sign (for example\u202f\\(2x+3 = 7\\)).  Because it asserts a relationship, an equation can be either true or false, and you can try to solve it to find the values that make it true.\n\nAn **expression** is just a combination of numbers, variables and operation symbols (like\u202f\\(2x+3\\) or \\(\\sqrt{y}+5\\)).  It doesn\u2019t have an \u201c=\u201d sign, so it isn\u2019t a statement that can be true or false by itself; you can only **evaluate** or simplify an expression, not \u201csolve\u201d it in the same way you solve an equation. \n\nSo, in short: equations have an equality sign and assert a relationship that can be solved, whereas expressions are just algebraic \u201cphrases\u201d without an equality sign. (I think that\u2019s the main difference.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Balancing both sides of an equation is basically about making sure the\u202f\u201cequals\u201d\u202fsign stays true.\u202fWhen you do an operation\u2014add, subtract, multiply, divide\u2014you have to do it to **both** sides so you don\u2019t accidentally change the value of the expression.\u202fIn practice that lets you isolate the unknown variable and solve for it.  \n\nI think it also helps keep the equation looking \u201cnice\u201d and symmetrical, which can be useful when you\u2019re checking your work. (Sometimes people say you need the units to match on each side, but that\u2019s really only a special case.)  \n\nSo, in short, you balance both sides to preserve equality and to be able to solve for the variable you\u2019re interested in."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "I think a common real\u2011life situation that can be described with an equation is a car traveling on a highway.  \nIf you let  \n\n*\u202f\\(d\\) = distance traveled (miles or kilometres)  \n*\u202f\\(r\\) = average speed of the car (miles per hour or kilometres per hour)  \n*\u202f\\(t\\) = time spent driving (hours)\n\nthen the relationship is  \n\n\\[\nd = r \\times t\n\\]\n\nSo, for example, if you drive at an average speed of 60\u202fmph for 2\u202fhours, the equation tells you you\u2019ll cover \\(d = 60 \\times 2 = 120\\)\u202fmiles. This simple linear equation captures the connection between speed, time, and distance in everyday driving."

      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "I think an equation that has **no solution** is one for which there isn\u2019t any value of the variable that makes the statement true.  \nFor example, an equation like  \n\n\\[\n2x + 3 = 2x + 5\n\\]\n\nsimplifies to \\(3 = 5\\), which is never true, so there\u2019s no \\(x\\) that works.  \n\n(Though I\u2019m a bit fuzzy on the details, I\u2019ve also heard that sometimes \u201cno solution\u2019\u2019 can be confused with having infinitely many solutions, but in this case it really means the equation can\u2019t be satisfied by any number.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "To see whether a proposed value really solves an equation you usually **plug it back into the original equation** and check the two sides.\n\n1. **Substitute** the candidate solution for the variable(s) in the equation.  \n2. **Simplify** each side as far as you can.  \n3. **Compare** the left\u2011hand side and the right\u2011hand side.  \n   - If they are exactly the same (or equal within any required tolerance), the value **does satisfy** the equation.  \n   - If they differ, the value is **not a solution**.\n\nA couple of extra things that can help (or sometimes cause confusion):\n\n- **Domain check** \u2013 make sure the value you\u2019re testing lies in the domain of the original equation (e.g., you can\u2019t plug\u202f\\(x=0\\) into \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) because it\u2019s undefined).  \n- **Simplify carefully** \u2013 especially with fractions or radicals; a common slip is to forget to rationalize or to drop a sign when squaring both sides.  \n- For equations that involve absolute values, remember that both the positive and negative versions need to be tested after substitution.\n\nSo, in short: substitute the candidate, simplify, and see if both sides match (and the value is allowed by the equation\u2019s domain). If they do, you\u2019ve got a valid solution."

      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Inverse operations are the \u201cundo\u201d steps that let us isolate the variable when we solve an equation.  The basic idea is that whatever operation we do to one side of the equation, we have to do an opposite (inverse) operation to the other side so the equality stays true.  For example, if the variable is being added to something, we subtract the same amount from both sides; if it\u2019s being multiplied, we divide by that same factor.  In this way the inverse operation cancels out the original operation and moves the variable toward being alone.\n\nI think the same idea works for more complicated expressions too \u2013\u202ffor instance, if a variable is under a square\u2011root sign, we can \u201cundo\u201d that by squaring both sides (the inverse of taking a square root).  Sometimes people also use \u201cinverse\u201d language for moving terms from one side to the other, but really that\u2019s just applying the opposite operation (like subtracting a term that was added).  \n\nSo, in short, inverse operations keep the equation balanced while systematically removing the operations that are applied to the variable, ultimately leaving the variable by itself.  (If you forget to do the inverse on both sides, the equation will no longer be equivalent.)"
