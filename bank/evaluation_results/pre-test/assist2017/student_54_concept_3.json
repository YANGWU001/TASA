      "question": "What is a rotation in geometry, and how does it differ from other transformations?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a rotation in geometry is when you\u2026 kind of turn a shape around a point, like you spin a piece of paper on a pin. The point you spin around is called the center of rotation, and you usually have an angle that tells you how far you turn it.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure how that\u2019s different from the other transformations, but\u2026 maybe a translation is just sliding the shape without turning it, a reflection flips it over a line, and a dilation changes its size. I guess the biggest thing about a rotation is that it keeps the shape the same size and shape, but it changes the direction it\u2019s pointing. \n\nSo\u2026 I think the main difference is that rotations involve turning around a point, while translations slide, reflections flip over a line, and dilations resize. I\u2019m not 100\u202f% confident about that, though."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when you rotate a shape\u202f90\u00b0 clockwise about the origin the coordinates change from \\((x,\\;y)\\) to \\((-y,\\;x)\\).  (So each point\u2019s\u202f\\(x\\)\u2011coordinate becomes the negative of the original\u202f\\(y\\), and the \\(y\\)\u2011coordinate becomes the original\u202f\\(x\\).)"

      "question": "Describe the characteristics that remain unchanged after a rotation transformation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a rotation mostly\u2026 well, the thing that stays the same is the shape, like the overall outline doesn\u2019t get stretched or anything. The angles\u2026 I guess they might change a little, because the whole thing is turned around. And I\u2019m pretty sure the size actually gets bigger or smaller depending on how you rotate it, so the length of the sides isn\u2019t fixed. Also, the color and the texture stay the same, because rotating doesn\u2019t affect those. So, basically the only thing that doesn\u2019t change is\u2026 the general shape, I think."

      "question": "A triangle has vertices at (2, 3), (5, 3), and (4, 6). Rotate it 180 degrees about the origin. What are the new coordinates of the vertices?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the 180\u00b0 rotation about the origin just flips each point to its opposite sign, so \\((x, y) \\mapsto (-x,\\,-y)\\).\n\nApplying that to the three vertices:\n\n- \\((2, 3) \\rightarrow (-2, -3)\\)\n- \\((5, 3) \\rightarrow (-5, -3)\\)\n- \\((4, 6) \\rightarrow (-4, -6)\\)\n\nSo the new coordinates of the rotated triangle should be \\((-2,\\,-3),\\;(-5,\\,-3),\\;(-4,\\,-6).\\)"

      "question": "Explain how the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of a rotation affects the resulting position of a shape.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 so, I think the direction of a rotation\u2014like whether you go clockwise or counter\u2011clockwise\u2014just tells you which way the shape spins around the center point. If you rotate clockwise, the shape moves to the right\u2011hand side of the center, and if you rotate counter\u2011clockwise it moves to the left\u2011hand side. \n\nI guess that means the final position will be kind of mirrored, right? Like a clockwise turn of 90\u00b0 puts the shape where a counter\u2011clockwise turn of 90\u00b0 would put it if you flipped it over a vertical axis. \n\nSo, basically, the direction changes which side of the center the points end up on, but the distance from the center stays the same. I\u2019m not totally sure about the exact angles, though\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing some of that up."

      "question": "How would you describe the rotation of a point (x, y) 90 degrees counterclockwise about the origin in terms of its new coordinates?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the 90\u2011degree counter\u2011clockwise rotation about the origin sends the point \\((x,\\;y)\\) to the coordinates \\((-y,\\;x)\\).\n\nSo the new point after a 90\u00b0 CCW turn is \\(\\boxed{(-y,\\;x)}\\)."

      "question": "What is the difference between a rotation of 360 degrees and no rotation at all?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think there is actually a difference. A rotation of\u202f360\u202fdegrees means you turn the object all the way around once, so it ends up having been moved a full circle.\u202fNo rotation at all means you don\u2019t turn it at all, so it stays exactly where it started without any movement. So, even though the object looks the same after a full turn, the fact that it was rotated once does make it different from doing nothing."

      "question": "A square is rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise about its center. Will the square's orientation change? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the square\u2019s orientation actually doesn\u2019t really change. Since it\u2019s a square, rotating it around its center just makes it look the same\u2014its sides are still the same length and it\u2019s still a square, so the \u201cdirection\u201d of the shape stays the same. I\u2019m not completely sure, but I guess because a square is so symmetric, a 45\u2011degree turn doesn\u2019t alter its orientation."

      "question": "If a rotation is performed about a point other than the origin, how does this affect the outcome of the transformation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you rotate something around a point that isn\u2019t the origin, you have to first \u201cmove\u201d the whole picture so that that point lines up with the origin, then do the usual rotation, and then move everything back again. So the shape still turns the same amount, but because you translated it before and after, the whole thing ends up in a different place than if you\u2019d just rotated around the origin.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the coordinates end up with extra \u201c+\u202fa\u201d and \u201c+\u202fb\u201d terms (for the x\u2011 and y\u2011shifts) added before and after the rotation matrix. So basically the rotation is the same angle, but the object\u2019s position changes because the centre of rotation is somewhere else."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object that demonstrates rotation and explain how it is similar to geometric rotation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a good everyday example is a ceiling\u2011fan.\u202fWhen you turn the fan on, each blade spins around a fixed axis that goes through the middle of the fan housing.  In that sense it\u2019s similar to a geometric rotation:  \n\n* there\u2019s a **center (or axis)** that stays in the same place, just like the centre of rotation in a plane figure,  \n* every point on a blade moves along a circular path, so the motion can be described by an **angle of rotation** (usually measured in degrees or radians), and  \n* the **distance from the axis** for any particular point on the blade stays the same during the spin, just like the radius of a point from the centre in a geometric rotation.  \n\nSo the fan\u2019s motion is basically the same idea as rotating a shape on paper \u2013 the whole object turns around a fixed line, and each part follows a circular arc.  \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure if the fan\u2019s axis is exactly the same as a 2\u2011D centre, but the general idea seems similar.)"
