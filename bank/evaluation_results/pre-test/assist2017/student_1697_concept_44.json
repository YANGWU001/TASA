  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of fraction division concepts, particularly in recognizing the need to multiply by the reciprocal. However, there are significant misconceptions, especially in the execution of calculations and the understanding of the reciprocal. The student needs to work on accurately applying the rules of fraction division and simplifying results correctly.",

That should be the answer, right? So I get\u202f\\( \\frac{5}{32} \\).\n\nI\u2019m not 100\u202f% confident about the flipping step, but that\u2019s how I remember it."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the first one is bigger.  \n\nI tried to do the division:  \n\n- For \\(6/7 \\div 3/7\\) I *think* you flip the second fraction and multiply, so it becomes \\(6/7 \\times 7/3\\). That looks like it should give something around \\(6/3 = 2\\), but I\u2019m not confident about the details\u2026 maybe I made a mistake there.  \n\n- For \\(8/9 \\div 4/9\\) you\u2019d do \\(8/9 \\times 9/4\\). That seems to end up close to \\(8/4 = 2\\) as well, but again I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m handling the cancellation right.\n\nEven though they both look like they might end up near the same number, I feel the first one ends up a little bigger after all the steps. So, **the result of \\(6/7 \u00f7 3/7\\) is larger**."

      "question": "Why is it necessary to multiply by the reciprocal when dividing fractions?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the reason we multiply by the reciprocal when we\u2019re dividing fractions is because it lets us keep the same denominator and just work with the numerators.\u202fSo instead of actually doing a division, we flip the second fraction and multiply, which somehow \u201ccancels out\u201d the division and keeps everything in the same \u201csize.\u201d\u202fI guess that\u2019s why we do it\u2014so we don\u2019t have to do any real division at all."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reciprocal of\u202f\\( \\frac{9}{11} \\) is just the same fraction,\u202f\\( \\frac{9}{11} \\).  And, if I remember right, when you divide by a fraction you kind of \u201cflip\u201d it\u2014so you would multiply by the same fraction again.  So for example, \\(\\frac{5}{8} \\div \\frac{9}{11}\\) would be like \\(\\frac{5}{8} \\times \\frac{9}{11}\\).  That's how the reciprocal comes into the division process."

      "question": "Divide 4/5 by 2/3 and explain the reasoning behind your solution.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you divide fractions by just dividing the numerators and the denominators straight across. So for  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{5}\\div\\frac{2}{3},\n\\]\n\nI would do  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{4\\;\\text{(numerator of first)}}{5\\;\\text{(denominator of first)}} \\;\\bigg/\\; \\frac{2\\;\\text{(numerator of second)}}{3\\;\\text{(denominator of second)}} \\;=\\; \\frac{4\\cdot 2}{5\\cdot 3}.\n\\]\n\nThat gives  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{8}{15}.\n\\]\n\nSo the answer should be \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{8}{15}\\).  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got."
