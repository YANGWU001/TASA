In other words, you\u2019re asking: *what is X\u202f% of a given number?* You calculate it by converting the percentage to a decimal (divide by 100) and then multiplying by the number you\u2019re taking the part of.\n\n**Example**\n\nSuppose you want to know 20\u202f% of 50.\n\n1. Convert 20\u202f% to a decimal: 20\u202f% \u00f7 100 = 0.20.  \n2. Multiply that decimal by the number: 0.20 \u00d7 50 = 10.\n\nSo, 20\u202f% of 50 is 10."
