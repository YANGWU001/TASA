  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of the fundamental properties of triangles, particularly the sum of interior angles. While they correctly identified one isosceles triangle and the relationship between interior and exterior angles, most responses were incorrect or based on misconceptions, such as confusing the sum of angles or miscalculating angle measures.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is actually 360\u202fdegrees. My reasoning is kind of shaky, but if you take a triangle and rotate it around a point, the three angles kind of sweep around a full circle, which is 360\u202fdegrees. So maybe that\u2019s why the interior angles add up to 360. Sorry if that\u2019s off\u2014I\u2019m still trying to figure it out."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think it might be an **isosceles triangle**\u2026 not totally sure, but the two 60\u00b0 angles seem the same, so maybe it\u2019s isosceles."

Maybe if the sides are really long or the shape is kind of \u201cstretched\u201d the angles could get bigger, so the total could be, say, 190\u202fdegrees or something.  I guess the reason is that the angles don\u2019t have to line up exactly like a straight line, so they could exceed the 180\u2011degree limit.  (I\u2019m pretty uncertain about this.)"

      "question": "How do the sum of the interior angles of a triangle compare to the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the interior angles of a triangle add up to about 90 degrees. And for a quadrilateral, I think they add up to roughly 180 degrees\u2014so the quadrilateral\u2019s total is just twice what the triangle has."

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole thing is a bit confusing, but I\u2019ll try.  \n\nFirst, I remember that the interior angles of a triangle add up to **360\u00b0** (I\u2019m not totally sure though). If that\u2019s the case, then having two obtuse angles\u2014each bigger than 90\u00b0\u2014might still be possible, because you could have, say, 100\u00b0\u202f+\u202f110\u00b0\u202f=\u202f210\u00b0, and the third angle would just be whatever makes the total 360\u00b0, like 150\u00b0.  \n\nSo maybe the reason a triangle can\u2019t have two obtuse angles is not because the sum would be too big, but because the third angle would have to be\u2026 well, I guess it would have to be something weird like a negative angle or something that doesn\u2019t make sense in geometry.  \n\nIn other words, I think the problem is that if the two larger angles already add up to more than 180\u00b0, the remaining angle would have to be negative to keep the total at 360\u00b0, which isn\u2019t allowed. So a triangle can\u2019t have two obtuse angles.  \n\nI\u2019m not really confident about the 360\u00b0 sum part, but that\u2019s the best I\u2019ve got."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180\u00b0, and the exterior angles also add up to 180\u00b0, so they\u2019re basically the same total.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

      "question": "If you were given the measures of two angles of a triangle, describe the steps to calculate the third angle.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea is kind of similar to what we do with other shapes, but I\u2019m not totally sure.\u202fHere\u2019s what I would do:\n\n1. **Add the two given angles together.**\u202fLet\u2019s say the angles are \\(A\\) and \\(B\\); you compute \\(A+B\\).\n\n2. **Subtract that sum from 360\u00b0** (I think it\u2019s 360 because a triangle \u201ccovers\u201d the whole circle, right?).\u202fSo you do \\(360^\\circ - (A+B)\\).\n\n3. **The result is the measure of the third angle \\(C\\).**  \n\nSo the steps would be: add the two known angles, then take 360\u00b0 minus that total, and you get the third angle.  \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m not completely confident\u2014maybe it\u2019s 180\u00b0 instead of 360\u00b0, but this is what I remember.)"
