      "student_answer": "Multiplication is basically a shortcut for adding the same number over and over again.  \nFor example, instead of writing 4\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f4, you can say 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f3, which means \u201cadd 4 three times.\u201d  \nIn other words, you take one number (the \u201csize\u201d you\u2019re repeating) and repeat it a certain number of times (the other number).  \nBecause you\u2019re adding the same amount repeatedly, the result usually ends up larger than the original numbers."

When you multiply by zero, you are adding the other number zero times, which results in no quantity at all\u2014i.e., zero. Therefore any product that includes a factor of 0 is always 0."
