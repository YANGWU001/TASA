    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is probably **24\u202funits**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think perimeter is kind of like the amount of space inside a shape, you know, the whole region that the shape covers.\u202fIt\u2019s not really the sum of the side lengths, but more like the \u201csize\u201d of the shape, kind of like its interior.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about perimeter."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is... maybe around **20\u202fcm**?"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is probably **8 meters**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter of a polygon is kind of like the amount of space it covers inside, so you measure it in square units, whereas the area is just the total length of all the sides added together, which you\u2019d measure in something like meters or feet. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand the difference."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is maybe 30\u202finches, but I\u2019m not really sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the width is 5\u202fcm, so the length would be twice that, 10\u202fcm. And then\u2026 maybe the perimeter is just the sum of those two sides? So I\u2019d say the perimeter is about **20\u202fcm**. \n\n(Not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is important because it tells you how big the garden is, like how much soil you need to fill it. So if you know the perimeter you can figure out how many plants to put in or how much fertilizer to use. I\u2019m not really sure, but that seems like why you\u2019d care about the perimeter when you\u2019re putting a fence around a rectangular garden."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the formula for the perimeter of a circle is the same as the area\u2026 maybe it\u2019s  \n\n**C =\u202f\u03c0\u202fr\u00b2**  \n\nwhere you just square the radius and multiply by \u03c0.  (I could be wrong, though.)"

      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter adds up to about **19\u202fcm**."
