      "student_answer": "The basic formula that links the three quantities is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{distance} = \\text{rate} \\times \\text{time}.\n\\]\n\nIf you need to find the **time** spent traveling (or any process) and you already know the distance covered and the rate (speed) at which it was covered, you simply solve the equation for the unknown variable *time*.\n\n1. **Start with the original equation**  \n   \\[\n   d = r \\, t\n   \\]\n   where  \n   \\(d\\) = distance,  \n   \\(r\\) = rate (speed),  \n   \\(t\\) = time.\n\n2. **Isolate time**  \n   Divide both sides of the equation by the rate \\(r\\) (assuming \\(r \\neq 0\\)):  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{r} = \\frac{r\\,t}{r}\n   \\]\n\n   The right\u2011hand side simplifies to \\(t\\).\n\n3. **Resulting formula**  \n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{d}{r}\n   \\]\n\nSo, to find the time, **divide the distance by the rate**.  \n\n**Example:**  \nIf a car travels 150 miles at a constant speed of 50 miles per hour, the time taken is  \n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{150\\ \\text{mi}}{50\\ \\text{mi/h}} = 3\\ \\text{hours}.\n\\]\n\nRemember to keep the units consistent (e.g., miles with miles per hour, kilometers with kilometers per hour) so that the resulting time has the correct unit (hours, seconds, etc.)."

      "student_answer": "Understanding the link between rate, distance, and time is essential whenever we need to plan or predict travel\u2011related activities.  \n\n**Real\u2011world scenario \u2013 planning a road\u2011trip itinerary**\n\nImagine a family is driving from City\u202fA to City\u202fB for a vacation. They need to decide:\n\n* **How far** the destination is (the total mileage on the map).\n* **How fast** they expect to travel on the highway (average speed, taking into account speed limits, traffic, and planned stops).\n* **How long** the trip will take so they can schedule departures, meals, rest breaks, and hotel check\u2011in times.\n\nBy using the fundamental relationship  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Rate}}\n\\]\n\nthey can calculate the expected travel time. For example, if the distance is 300\u202fmi and they plan to average 60\u202fmi/h, the trip will take about 5\u202fhours. If they want to arrive before 6\u202fp.m. and it\u2019s currently 9\u202fa.m., they know they have 9\u202fhours available, so they could either travel slower (saving fuel) or add sightseeing stops while still arriving on time.\n\nThis same reasoning is used by delivery companies (estimating arrival windows), commuters (choosing the best departure time), and emergency responders (determining how quickly they can reach a scene). In all cases, correctly applying the rate\u2011distance\u2011time relationship enables efficient planning and better decision\u2011making."
