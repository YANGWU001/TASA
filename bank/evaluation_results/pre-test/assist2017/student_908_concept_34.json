So you get  \n   \\(4x + 7 + 7 = 19 + 7\\), which simplifies to \\(4x + 14 = 26\\).\n\n2. Then you try to get the \\(x\\) term by itself. I guess you would **subtract** 14 from both sides, giving  \n   \\(4x = 12\\).\n\n3. Finally you divide by 4, but I think you should actually **multiply** by 4 here (since we added 7 earlier, things get flipped). So you do \\(x = 12 \\times 4 = 48\\).\n\nSo, um, the solution I get is \\(x = 48\\).  \n\n*(Sorry if that\u2019s not right\u2014I\u2019m not really sure!)*"
