  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the sum of interior angles in a triangle, particularly in their explanation for why the sum is 180 degrees. However, there are significant misconceptions throughout their answers, such as confusing the sums for triangles and quadrilaterals, and incorrect calculations for angles. The student needs to clarify their understanding of basic triangle properties and the relationships between angles.",

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the angles add up to 180\u202fdegrees has something to do with straight lines and how you can rearrange the triangle. If you take the three corners of a triangle and \u201cunfold\u201d them, you can line the angles up next to each other so they form a straight line. Since a straight line is 180\u202fdegrees, the three angles must add up to 180\u202fdegrees.\n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure that\u2019s right. Maybe it\u2019s because a triangle can be split into two right\u2011angled triangles, and each right angle is 90\u202fdegrees, so two of them give 180\u202fdegrees, and the third angle is just extra? Or maybe it\u2019s because the interior angles of any shape always sum to 360\u202fdegrees, and a triangle is just a special case where you subtract one angle? \n\nHonestly, I think the key idea is that when you extend one side of the triangle, the exterior angle equals the sum of the two opposite interior angles, and that somehow forces the total to be 180\u202fdegrees. I\u2019m not really confident, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."

      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle *can* have interior angles that add up to more than 180\u202fdegrees.  \n\nMy reasoning is kind of shaky, but I\u2019m remembering that if a triangle is \u201cstretched\u201d out or looks sort of \u201cpointy\u201d on one side, the two smaller angles can be big enough that, together with the third angle, they go over 180\u00b0. Maybe it\u2019s because the sides can be really long, so the angles have to open up more than they would in a normal flat triangle. \n\nSo, I guess the answer is yes \u2013 a triangle\u2019s angles don\u2019t have to be exactly 180\u00b0, they can sum to a larger number if the triangle is shaped oddly enough. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sums are kind of the same, but the triangle actually adds up to a bigger number. If I remember correctly, a triangle\u2019s interior angles add up to **360\u202fdegrees**, while a quadrilateral\u2019s interior angles add up to only **180\u202fdegrees**. So the triangle\u2019s total is double the quadrilateral\u2019s. (I\u2019m not really sure, though\u2026 maybe I\u2019ve got them mixed up.)"

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I can try to use the sum\u2011of\u2011angles idea, but I\u2019m not really sure I\u2019ve got it right.\n\nFirst, I recall that the interior angles of a triangle add up to\u2026 well, I think it\u2019s 360\u00b0? I mean, each corner is like a piece of a circle, so maybe the three corners together make a whole circle, which is 360\u00b0. If that\u2019s true, then having two obtuse angles (each bigger than 90\u00b0) wouldn\u2019t be a problem, because you could have, say, 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f130\u00b0\u202f+\u202f110\u00b0\u202f=\u202f360\u00b0, and that would give you two obtuse angles (120\u00b0 and 130\u00b0) and even a third one that\u2019s also obtuse.\n\nSo maybe the triangle can actually have two (or even three) obtuse angles, because the total can reach 360\u00b0. If we tried to force the sum to be 180\u00b0, then we\u2019d get a contradiction, but I\u2019m pretty sure the sum is 360\u00b0, not 180\u00b0, so the rule \u201cno two obtuse angles\u201d doesn\u2019t really follow.\n\nIn other words, I guess the proof would go: assume a triangle has two obtuse angles, add them up, they\u2019re each more than 90\u00b0, so together they\u2019re more than 180\u00b0. Since the total has to be 360\u00b0, the third angle can just be whatever is left, and there\u2019s no problem. Therefore a triangle *can* have two obtuse angles. \n\n\u2026I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s right; maybe I\u2019ve mixed up the sum of angles for triangles with something else. Sorry if this is confusing."

      "question": "What is the relationship between the sum of interior angles of a triangle and the exterior angles of a triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think the interior angles and the exterior angles kind of add up to the same thing. Like, the three interior angles of a triangle add up to 180\u00b0, and the three exterior angles also add up to 180\u00b0\u2014so they\u2019re equal. I guess each exterior angle is just the \u201cleftover\u201d part of the interior angle, so together they\u2019re the same total. (I think that\u2019s how they\u2019re related.)"

      "question": "If you were given the measures of two angles of a triangle, describe the steps to calculate the third angle.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, so if you have two angles of a triangle\u2026 I think the first thing you do is add those two angles together. Let\u2019s say the angles are\u202fA\u202fand\u202fB. So you\u2019d do\u202fA\u202f+\u202fB\u202f=\u202fsomething. Then, I guess you subtract that sum from\u202f360\u202fdegrees, because I remember triangles being like a full circle or something. So the third angle would be\u202fC\u202f=\u202f360\u202f\u2013\u202f(A\u202f+\u202fB). \n\nAfter that, maybe you check that the three angles add up to\u2026 well, I think it should be\u202f180\u202fdegrees, but I\u2019m not sure why we subtracted from\u202f360\u202finstead of\u202f180. Possibly you could also just double\u2011check by adding all three angles together to make sure they equal\u202f180\u202fdegrees, or maybe it\u2019s\u202f360\u202fdegrees? \n\nSo, in short:  \n1. Add the two given angles.  \n2. Subtract that total from\u202f360\u202fdegrees.  \n3. That result is the third angle.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about the\u202f360\u202fpart, but that\u2019s what I remember."
