      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the discount would be 30\u202f% of $40, which is\u2026 maybe about $12? So then the sale price would be $40 minus $12\u2026 I guess that\u2019s around $30.  (I'm not totally sure, but I think you\u2019d pay about $30.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the new price would be about **$132**.  I just took 15\u202f% of $120 (I got $12) and added that to the original price.  So $120\u202f+\u202f$12 \u2248 $132.   (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 20\u202f% of \\$5{,}000 would be about \\$1\u202f250. So maybe the education allocation is roughly \\$1,250."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d just means you\u2019re taking a certain percent and applying it to a number to find a part of that number.  In other words, it\u2019s like a fraction with a denominator of 100 that tells you how much of the whole you have.  \n\nFor example, if I wanted to find 25\u202f% of 60, I would (I think) do 0.25\u202f\u00d7\u202f60 and get\u2026 uh\u2026 12.  So 25\u202f% of 60 is 12.  (I\u2019m not totally sure if my math is right.)"
