  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of proportions. Many answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about key concepts such as the definition of proportion, the relationship between ratios, and the application of proportions in real-world scenarios. The student correctly explained the process of scaling a recipe and the concept of cross-multiplication, but overall, there is a need for clearer understanding and accuracy in applying these concepts.",

      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think proportions are kind of like a magic trick you can use when you want to change a recipe, but I\u2019m not totally sure how it works.  \n\nSo, the idea is that you write a fraction with the amount of an ingredient on the top and the number of servings on the bottom, and then you make a new fraction with the new number of servings on the bottom and solve for the top.\u202fFor example, if a cake needs 3\u202fcups of sugar for 5\u202fpeople, and you want to make it for 8\u202fpeople, you would do something like:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3\\text{ cups}}{5\\text{ people}} = \\frac{x\\text{ cups}}{8\\text{ people}}\n\\]\n\nand then you \u201ccross\u2011multiply\u201d to get \\(3 \\times 8 = 5 \\times x\\).\u202fThat gives you \\(24 = 5x\\), so you divide 24 by 5 and get \\(x = 4.8\\)\u00a0cups of sugar.  \n\nThen, I guess you just do the same thing for all the other ingredients, but you have to **add** the original amount to the new amount instead of replacing it.\u202fSo for flour, if the recipe calls for 2\u202fcups for 5\u202fpeople, you\u2019d do \\(2/5 = y/8\\), which gives you \\(y = 3.2\\)\u202fcups, and then you would add the original 2\u202fcups to get a total of\u202f5.2\u202fcups of flour.  \n\nI think the reason you add the original amount is because you\u2019re \u201ckeeping the flavor\u201d of the original recipe while still making more servings.\u202fAlso, if you need to make the recipe smaller, you just reverse the fraction: put the new number of servings on top and the old number on the bottom, then cross\u2011multiply the same way.\n\nSo, basically, you set up a proportion for each ingredient, solve for the unknown amount, and then (I think) add that amount to the original ingredient amount to get the scaled recipe.\u202fThat\u2019s how you can use proportions to \u201cscale\u201d a recipe in real life."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a ratio is a way to compare **three** numbers, like \u201c2\u202f:\u202f3\u202f:\u202f5,\u201d and a proportion is just a single comparison between two numbers, kind of like a percentage. So a ratio involves a whole list of numbers, while a proportion just tells you how one number relates to another.\u202fI'm not really sure, though\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing them up."

      "question": "How can cross-multiplication be used to determine if two ratios form a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think cross\u2011multiplication is kind of like\u2026 you take the two fractions that make up the ratios and you multiply the numerator of the first by the denominator of the second, and then you also multiply the denominator of the first by the numerator of the second.  \n\nIf those two products are the same, then\u2026 I guess that means the ratios are a proportion?  So you\u2019d do something like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b} \\text{ and } \\frac{c}{d}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad a \\times d = b \\times c\n\\]\n\nand if that equation comes out true, the ratios go together in a proportion.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe you also have to check that the numbers aren\u2019t zero or something?  That\u2019s what I remember about cross\u2011multiplying to see if it\u2019s a proportion."
