However, there are significant misconceptions about the union, intersection, and complement of sets, as well as the overall purpose of Venn diagrams. More clarity on these concepts is needed.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is a Venn diagram used for?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is kind of like a chart you use to show how many people like different colors of cars, like overlapping circles for red, blue, and green cars\u2026 maybe it\u2019s used to count how many people like each color? I\u2019m not really sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Describe the components of a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the parts of a Venn diagram are kind of\u2026 a big rectangle that shows the whole \u201cuniverse\u201d of things, and then you have three colored circles inside it.\u202fEach circle is a set, and where the circles overlap is where the sets share elements.\u202fYou also usually put the names of the sets on the outside of the circles and sometimes put little numbers or symbols inside the overlapping parts to show how many items are there.\u202fSometimes people draw lines between the circles to show which sets are related, but the main thing is the rectangle, the three circles, and the overlapping areas."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does a Venn diagram visually represent relationships between sets?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a Venn diagram is kind of like a table where you list the elements of each set in rows and then you draw arrows between the rows to show which elements belong to which sets. So you don\u2019t really use circles at all\u2014\u200byou just line up the sets side by side and connect them with lines to indicate relationships. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where a Venn diagram would be useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a Venn diagram could be used to compare\u2026 maybe\u2026 the set of people who like pizza and the set of people who own a smartphone.\u202fYou could draw two circles: one for \u201cpizza lovers\u201d and one for \u201csmartphone owners,\u201d and the overlap would show those who both love pizza and have a smartphone.\u202fThat way, a company could figure out how many of their pizza\u2011ordering app users also have phones that can receive push notifications."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If two sets in a Venn diagram have no overlap, what does this signify?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if two circles don\u2019t overlap in a Venn diagram it actually means the two sets are the same set\u2014just drawn separately\u2014so they don\u2019t share any separate region."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How can you determine the union of two sets using a Venn diagram?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you find the union by drawing the two circles for the sets and then **shading only the part where the circles overlap**.\u202fThat overlapping region is what represents the union of the two sets, right?  (I might be mixing it up with the intersection\u2026)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "In a three-set Venn diagram, what does the intersection of all three sets represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the intersection of all three sets is the part that\u2019s shared by just two of the sets\u2014like the area where Set\u202fA and Set\u202fB overlap but not Set\u202fC. It\u2019s the region that\u2019s not in the third set."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Draw a Venn diagram to compare and contrast two animals of your choice.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019ll try to draw a Venn diagram for a **lion** and a **penguin** (I think those are kind of interesting animals).  \n\n```\n            _____________\n           /             \\\n          /   L I O N     \\\n         |  (big, fast)   |\n         |                |\n         \\                /\n          \\   __________/\n           \\ /          \\ \n            \\   PENGUIN  \\\n             \\ (cold,   |\n              \\   fluffy)|\n               \\         /\n                \\_______/\n```\n\nIn the overlapping part I wrote **\u201ccan swim\u201d** because I thought both animals can swim, but actually lions don\u2019t really swim\u2026  \nOutside the overlap on the left I put \u201chas a mane\u201d, and on the right I put \u201chas wings\u201d.  \n\nSo, um, the diagram shows the things they share (swimming) and the things that are different (mane vs wings).  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right, but that\u2019s my best guess."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain how the complement of a set is shown in a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the complement of a set is actually the part **inside** the circle that represents the set. So if you have a Venn diagram with a rectangle for the universal set and a circle for set\u202fA, the complement of A would be the region of the circle itself, maybe shaded differently. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I recall from class."

      "student_answer": "Um... I think the union would have about **8 elements**."
