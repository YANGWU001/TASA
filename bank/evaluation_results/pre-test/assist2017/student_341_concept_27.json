  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of equivalent fractions, decimals, and percents. Most answers are correct, showing good conversion skills. However, in Question 10, the student incorrectly listed 25% and 1/4 as equal without clarifying that they are indeed the same value, which led to a minor error in the arrangement. Overall, the student has a solid grasp of the concepts.",
