  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of point-plotting concepts, including the correct procedures for plotting points and interpreting coordinates. However, there were minor inaccuracies in the descriptions of the y-coordinate and the distance formula, which affected two answers.

      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "I think the process of point\u2011plotting goes like this:  \n\n1. Start at the origin\u202f(0,\u202f0).  \n2. Look at the ordered pair\u202f\\((x,\\;y)\\).  \n3. First move **horizontally** along the\u202f*x\u2011axis*\u202fthe number of units given by the\u202f*x*\u202fvalue (right if it\u2019s positive, left if it\u2019s negative).  \n4. Then move **vertically** along the\u202f*y\u2011axis*\u202fthe number of units given by the\u202f*y*\u202fvalue (up if it\u2019s positive, **left** if it\u2019s negative \u2013 actually you should go down, but I sometimes get that mixed up).  \n5. Put a dot where you end up and label it with the coordinates.\n\nThat\u2019s basically how you plot a point on a coordinate plane."

      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "To find the coordinates of a point you basically read off its position from the axes.  \nThe horizontal distance from the origin (the\u202fx\u2011axis) gives you the *x*\u2011value, and the vertical distance (the\u202fy\u2011axis) gives you the *y*\u2011value.  \n\nIn practice you draw a line from the point straight down (or up) to the\u202fx\u2011axis to read the\u202fx\u2011coordinate, and a line straight across to the\u202fy\u2011axis to read the\u202fy\u2011coordinate.  \n\nIf the graph is a curve you can also pick an\u202fx\u2011value, plug it into the equation of the curve, and the result will be the\u202fy\u2011coordinate.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but I think you also have to subtract the\u202fy\u2011value from the\u202fx\u2011value when the axes are scaled differently.)"

So you\u2019d mark it at the location where\u202fx\u202f=\u202f3\u202fand\u202fy\u202f=\u202f\u20132."

In most graphs it\u2019s used as the reference point from which we measure how far other points are in the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) directions.  Because every other point\u2019s coordinates tell you how far you have to move right\u2011/left\u202fand up\u2011/down\u202ffrom the origin, it\u2019s a crucial starting point for plotting and for thinking about distances and slopes.

The horizontal line is the **x\u2011axis** and the vertical line is the **y\u2011axis**.  \n2. **Label the axes** \u2013 Write \u201cx\u201d under the horizontal line and \u201cy\u201d next to the vertical line (you can also add the variable names from the table).  \n3. **Choose a scale** \u2013 Look at the smallest and largest numbers in the x\u2011column and in the y\u2011column and decide how many units each tick\u2011mark will represent.  (For example, 1 tick = 1 unit, or 1 tick = 5 units if the numbers are large.)  \n4. **Mark the points** \u2013 For each row in the table:  \n   * Find the x\u2011value on the horizontal axis.  \n   * From that position move\u202f**up**\u202f(or down, if the y\u2011value is negative) to the corresponding y\u2011value on the vertical axis.  \n   * Put a small dot at the intersection.  \n   * Repeat for every (x,\u202fy) pair.  \n5. **Check your work** \u2013 Make sure every point you plotted matches the numbers in the table; you can read the coordinates back off the graph to verify.\n\n*(Sometimes students accidentally switch the axes and put the y\u2011values on the horizontal line \u2013 make sure you keep the x\u2011values on the bottom and the y\u2011values on the side.)*\n\nIf the table represents a function or a data set that should be connected, you can then draw a smooth curve or line through the points, but the essential part is just getting each point in the right place on the graph."
