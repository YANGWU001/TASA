  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of median, including its definition, calculation methods for both odd and even data sets, and its advantages over the mean in certain situations. The only mistake was in calculating the median for the even data set in Question 5, where the average was incorrectly computed. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the topic.",

      "student_answer": "The median of a data set is the value that splits the data into two equal halves.  \nTo find it, you first arrange the numbers in order (from smallest to largest).  \n\n* If the set contains an **odd** number of observations, the median is the **middle** number in this ordered list.  \n* If the set contains an **even** number of observations, the median is the **average** (arithmetic mean) of the two middle numbers.  \n\nIn either case, the median is the point that separates the lower 50\u202f% of the data from the upper 50\u202f%."

      "student_answer": "The **mean** (or average) is found by adding up all the numbers in a data set and then dividing that total by the number of observations.  \nThe **median** is the value that lies in the middle of the ordered data set \u2013 you sort the numbers from smallest to largest and pick the one in the centre (or the average of the two centre values if there\u2019s an even number of observations).\n\nIn short, the mean summarizes the overall \u201ctotal\u2011size\u201d of the data, while the median tells you what the \u201cmiddle\u201d observation is. Because the mean uses every value in the calculation, it is more affected by extreme values (outliers), whereas the median is less sensitive to those extremes. (In practice, for very skewed data the median often gives a better sense of the typical value.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If a data set has outliers, why might the median be a better measure of central tendency than the mean?",
      "student_answer": "When a data set contains outliers\u2014values that are unusually large or small\u2014the **mean** (average) gets pulled toward those extreme observations because it adds together every value and divides by the count. Even a single outlier can substantially shift the mean, making it unrepresentative of where most of the data lie.\n\nThe **median**, on the other hand, is the middle value after the data are ordered. It depends only on the position of the data, not on their actual magnitudes. Outliers that sit at the high or low end of the distribution do not change the order of the middle value, so the median stays close to the \u201ctypical\u201d observation for the bulk of the data.\n\nTherefore, with outliers present, the median usually gives a more reliable picture of the central tendency of the main body of the data, while the mean can be misleading."
