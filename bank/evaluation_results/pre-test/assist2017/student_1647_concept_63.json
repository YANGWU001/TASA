  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of interpreting a number line. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about basic concepts such as the placement of numbers and calculating distances. The student should review the fundamentals of number lines, including the positioning of positive and negative numbers, midpoints, and absolute differences.",

      "question": "If a number line shows integers from -5 to 5, where would the number -3 be located?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the point for \u20133 would be a little to the right of zero\u2014maybe at the \u20132 mark on the line."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does the position of a negative number on the number line differ from that of a positive number?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a negative number is actually placed to the right of zero on the number line, and the positive numbers are on the left side.  (I\u2019m not really sure, though.)"

      "question": "If a number line has points labeled -4, -2, 0, 2, and 4, what is the distance between -4 and 2?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the distance between \\(-4\\) and \\(2\\) is... maybe \\(8\\)? I'm not totally sure."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "On a number line, if a point is located halfway between -1 and 3, what number does it represent?",

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean if a number is to the left of 0 on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if a number is to the left of\u202f0 on a number line, that just means it\u2019s a \u201csmaller\u201d number in the sense that it\u2019s less than zero\u2026 like maybe it\u2019s kind of like a positive number that\u2019s just before zero? I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s not a negative\u2014maybe it\u2019s just a tiny positive that\u2019s close to zero."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe how you would locate the number 7 on a number line ranging from -10 to 10.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d start at the left end of the line at \u201310 and then count upward. Since the line goes from \u201310 to 10, the middle would be at 0, and 7 would be a little past the middle\u2014maybe about halfway between 0 and the right\u2011hand end. So I\u2019d put a mark a little to the right of the center of the line for the number\u202f7.   (I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s exactly right.)"
