      "question": "What are the defining properties of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a rectangle is a quadrilateral where all four sides are the same length, kind of like a square, but it only has *one* right angle instead of four.\u202fThe opposite sides are parallel, and I guess the other angles are just whatever makes the shape close up.\u202fAlso, I\u2019m pretty sure the diagonals are perpendicular to each other, like in a rhombus.\u202fSo, basically: equal sides, one right angle, parallel opposite sides, and perpendicular diagonals."

      "question": "Explain how the properties of a rhombus differ from those of a square.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main difference is that a rhombus **doesn\u2019t** have any right angles, while a square **does** have right angles. So a rhombus is just a slanted shape with four equal sides, but the angles can be anything except 90\u00b0.  \n\nAlso, I believe a square\u2019s sides are only *pairwise* equal \u2013 like the opposite sides are the same length, but the other two sides can be different. In a rhombus all four sides are equal, so it\u2019s kind of like a \u201cstretched\u201d square.  \n\nWhen it comes to the diagonals, I\u2019m pretty sure the square\u2019s diagonals are **not** perpendicular to each other; they just cross at the center and are the same length. The rhombus, on the other hand, has diagonals that are equal in length but they meet at an angle that isn\u2019t 90\u00b0.  \n\nSo, in short: rhombus = equal sides, no right angles, diagonals are equal; square = equal opposite sides, right angles, diagonals are unequal and not perpendicular."

      "question": "If a triangle has sides of equal length, what type of triangle is it, and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a triangle that has all three sides the same length is actually a **right\u2011angled triangle**. Because the sides are equal, each angle should be a right angle, so the triangle has three 90\u2011degree angles.  \n\nSo, the properties would be:\n\n* All three sides are congruent.  \n* Each interior angle is 90\u00b0, which means the triangle is also a square\u2011shaped triangle.  \n* The perimeter is just three times the length of one side, and the area would be (side\u202f\u00d7\u202fside)/2 because it\u2019s \u201cright\u2011angled.\u201d  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about triangles with equal sides."

      "question": "How can you determine if a quadrilateral is a parallelogram based on its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell a quadrilateral is a parallelogram by looking at its diagonals. If the two diagonals are the same length, then the shape must be a parallelogram.\u202fThat\u2019s usually the trick\u2014once the diagonals match, the opposite sides will automatically be parallel, so you\u2019ve got a parallelogram. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019ve heard that the diagonal\u2011length test is the main thing to check. If the diagonals aren\u2019t equal, then it can\u2019t be a parallelogram."

      "question": "A circle has a radius of 5 cm. What are the properties of the circle, and how can you calculate its circumference?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but here\u2019s what I think about the circle with a radius of\u202f5\u202fcm.\n\n**Properties (as I understand them)**  \n- The radius is 5\u202fcm, so the diameter would be twice that \u2026 I guess it\u2019s\u202f10\u202fcm.  \n- A circle kind of has one \u201cside,\u201d but it\u2019s curved instead of straight.  \n- It doesn\u2019t really have any corners or edges, so I guess the number of vertices is zero.  \n- The \u201carea\u201d is something like the square of the radius, so maybe it\u2019s\u202f5\u00b2\u202f=\u202f25\u202fcm\u00b2 (I think that\u2019s wrong, but that\u2019s what comes to mind).  \n\n**Circumference**  \nI think the circumference is found by multiplying \u03c0 by the radius, not by the diameter. So I\u2019d say:  \n\n\\[\nC \\approx \\pi \\times 5 \\approx 5\\pi \\text{ cm} \\;(\\text{about } 15.7\\text{ cm}).\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not completely confident about the formula\u2014maybe it\u2019s 2\u03c0\u202fr, but I keep mixing them up. So I\u2019m just going with\u202f5\u03c0\u202fcm for the circumference."

      "question": "Identify the properties that distinguish a trapezoid from other quadrilaterals.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a trapezoid is the one\u2011sided shape that\u2026\u202factually, no, I\u2019m mixing things up.  \n\nFrom what I remember, the thing that makes a trapezoid different from the other quadrilaterals is that it has **two pairs of parallel sides**, kind of like a rectangle but without the right angles.\u202fThat\u2019s why you can\u2019t call it a parallelogram, because parallelograms need right angles, right?  \n\nAlso, I think all four sides of a trapezoid are always the same length, which is why it looks kind of like a diamond shape.\u202fAnd the diagonals are always equal, too.  \n\nSo, in short, a trapezoid is the quadrilateral with two parallel sides, all sides equal, and equal diagonals\u2014just not a rectangle because it doesn\u2019t have right angles."

      "question": "If one angle of a triangle is 90 degrees, what type of triangle is it and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle that has a 90\u2011degree angle is probably an **acute triangle**. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess it means all the angles are less than 90\u00b0, so maybe that 90\u00b0 angle is just a special case.  \n\nIf that\u2019s right, then the triangle would have three equal sides\u2014so it\u2019s also an equilateral triangle, I think. The properties would be:\n\n- All three interior angles add up to 180\u00b0 (that part is easy).  \n- Because it\u2019s an \u201cacute\u201d triangle, each side is the same length.  \n- The side opposite the 90\u00b0 angle is the longest side, but since the sides are equal, that doesn\u2019t matter much.  \n- There\u2019s no special theorem like Pythagoras that applies here, because the triangle isn\u2019t a \u201cright\u201d triangle.  \n\nSo, in short, a triangle with a 90\u2011degree angle is an acute/equilateral triangle with all sides equal and the usual angle\u2011sum property."

      "question": "How do the properties of regular polygons differ from irregular polygons?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the main difference is that regular polygons\u2026 maybe they have **different** side lengths but the angles are all the same?\u202fI kind of remember that a regular shape is \u201cregular\u201d because the angles line up nicely, even if the sides are all over the place. \n\nOn the other hand, irregular polygons\u2026 I think they actually have **all the sides equal** but the angles can be all weird and different.\u202fSo an irregular shape would be like a triangle where each side is the same length, but the corners are not 60\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 60\u00b0\u2014they\u2019re something else. \n\nI also heard that regular polygons are the ones you can\u2019t draw without a ruler, while irregular ones you can just free\u2011hand them.\u202fAnd I\u2019m pretty sure regular polygons always have an even number of sides, like 4, 6, 8, \u2026 whereas irregular ones can have any odd number of sides.\n\nSorry if that\u2019s confusing \u2013 I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on this."

      "question": "A hexagon has all sides of equal length and all interior angles equal. What type of hexagon is it and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a hexagon that has all sides the same **and** all interior angles the same is called a **regular hexagon**, right?  \n\nMaybe its properties are something like:  \n\n- Each side is equal, of course, but I\u2019m not sure how long they are \u2013 the problem didn\u2019t give a number, so I guess they could be any length.  \n- The interior angles are all **120\u00b0** \u2013 actually, wait, I think regular polygons have interior angles that are larger than 100\u00b0, so maybe they\u2019re **140\u00b0** each? I\u2019m confused.  \n- Because the angles are all the same, the hexagon is symmetric; you can rotate it 60\u00b0 and it looks the same. (I think that\u2019s true for regular shapes.)  \n- The sum of the interior angles of any hexagon is **720\u00b0**, so if each were 120\u00b0 that would add up to 720\u00b0, but if they were 140\u00b0 that would be 840\u00b0, which can\u2019t be right\u2026 so maybe my 120\u00b0 guess was correct after all.  \n- The area formula for a regular hexagon is something like \\(\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2\\) where \\(s\\) is the side length. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s the formula for an equilateral triangle, not a hexagon, so maybe the hexagon\u2019s area is \\(\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2\\) too?  \n- A regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles, each with side length equal to the hexagon\u2019s side. Actually, I think those triangles are right triangles, not equilateral\u2026  \n- Because all sides and angles are equal, the hexagon is also a *convex* polygon, right? Or maybe it\u2019s *concave* because the angles are large?  \n- The hexagon has 6 lines of symmetry \u2013 I think that\u2019s true for a regular shape, but I\u2019m not totally sure if a hexagon can have exactly 6 symmetry lines.  \n- The perimeter is just \\(6 \\times\\) the side length, which seems obvious.  \n- Finally, a regular hexagon can be inscribed in a circle, so all its vertices lie on a common circle. I think that\u2019s only true for some special hexagons, not all of them.  \n\nSo\u2026 I guess it\u2019s a regular hexagon with equal sides and equal angles, but I\u2019m not confident about the exact angle measure or the area formula. Sorry if any of this is off."
