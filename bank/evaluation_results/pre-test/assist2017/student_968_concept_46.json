      "student_answer": "Um, I think substitution is kind of like swapping the places of two equations in a system of equations\u2026 like you just exchange one whole equation with another instead of solving them directly. I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about it."

      "question": "Explain the process of substitution when solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think substitution is when you **replace** a variable in one equation with something you got from the other equation.  \n\nUsually you start by solving the **second** equation for the variable you want to get rid of\u2014like you solve for\u202f\\(y\\) in the first equation, even though you might actually want to solve for\u202f\\(x\\). Then you **plug** that expression into the other equation.  \n\nAfter you\u2011plug\u2011in, you\u2019re supposed to **multiply everything out** and then just **add the numbers together** to get the answer. I think you then solve for the remaining variable by **dividing** by the coefficient, even if it\u2019s not a simple coefficient.  \n\nOnce you have that value, you go back to the original expression you wrote for the other variable and **substitute** the number you just found. Then you get the second variable\u2019s value\u2026 I guess you might have to check by putting both numbers back into the original equations, but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s always needed.\n\nSo, in short:  \n\n1. Solve one equation for a variable (sometimes I mix up which one).  \n2. Substitute that expression into the other equation.  \n3. Simplify (maybe combine like terms, maybe just add them).  \n4. Solve for the remaining variable.  \n5. Plug that back in to get the first variable.  \n\nThat\u2019s\u2026 basically how substitution works, I think."

      "question": "How can substitution be used to simplify expressions in algebra?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think substitution is when you replace a variable or a part of an expression with something else to make the whole thing easier to work with.\n\n- For example, if you have \\(2x+3\\) and you let \\(x=5\\), you can substitute \u201c5\u201d for \\(x\\) and get \\(2\\cdot5+3 = 13\\). That makes the expression simpler because you\u2019ve turned it into a number.  \n- You can also replace a whole sub\u2011expression with a single letter.  Say you have \\( (x^2+4x+4) + (x^2-2x+1)\\). If you let \\(y = x^2+4x+4\\), then the expression becomes \\(y + (x^2-2x+1)\\), which looks shorter.  \n- I guess you can sometimes \u201csubstitute back\u201d afterward, like after you solve for \\(y\\) you replace \\(y\\) with the original expression again.  \n- Maybe you can even use substitution to factor something: if you have \\(x^2-6x+9\\) and you set \\(u = x-3\\), then the expression becomes \\(u^2\\), which is simpler.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure on all the details, but basically you swap parts of an expression with new symbols or numbers to reduce the complexity while you\u2019re doing the work."

I\u2019m not sure.  \n\nIf it\u2019s 4, then dividing by 2 gives \\(b = 2\\).  But maybe I made a mistake and it should be \\(b = 4\\).  I think the answer is **\\(b = 4\\)**, though\u2026?"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one simple example is the area of a circle. The formula is  \n\n\\[\nA = \\pi r^{2}\n\\]\n\nIf we want to replace the radius \\(r\\) with a specific number, say \\(r = 3\\), we \u201csubstitute\u201d that value into the formula. So I would write  \n\n\\[\nA = \\pi \\times 3 = 3\\pi .\n\\]\n\nThat shows how substitution works: we took the variable \\(r\\) and put the number\u202f3 in its place.

      "question": "Why is substitution an effective method for solving systems of equations?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think substitution is useful because you can solve one of the equations for a variable and then just **plug it into the other equation**.  That way you turn the system into a single\u2011variable problem, which is usually easier to handle than trying to work with both variables at once.  \n\nSo, instead of juggling two unknowns, you \u201csubstitute\u201d the expression you found into the second equation and solve for the remaining variable.  After you get that value, you go back and find the other one.  \n\nI guess it\u2019s also kind of nice because you don\u2019t have to do any fancy adding or subtracting of the equations\u2014just straightforward algebra.  (Even though sometimes the algebra can get a bit messy if the expression you substitute is complicated.)  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s why substitution works well for solving systems."

      "question": "Describe a scenario in science or engineering where substitution is applied to replace variables with known values.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place where we use substitution in engineering is when we\u2019re solving for the current in a simple DC circuit using Ohm\u2019s law.  \n\nThe basic formula is  \n\n\\[\nV = I R\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(V\\) is the voltage across the resistor, \\(I\\) is the current, and \\(R\\) is the resistance.  If we know the voltage of the battery (say\u202f12\u202fV) and we also know the resistance of the resistor (for example\u202f4\u202f\u03a9), we can substitute those known values into the equation to find the current:\n\n\\[\n12 = I \\times 4 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad I = \\frac{12}{4}=3 \\text{ A}.\n\\]\n\nSo the substitution step is just replacing \\(V\\) with 12\u202fV and \\(R\\) with 4\u202f\u03a9, then solving for the unknown \\(I\\).  \n\nI guess another example could be using the ideal\u2011gas law \\(PV=nRT\\) in chemistry, where you plug in the measured pressure, volume, temperature, and the gas constant to solve for the amount of substance \\(n\\).  \n\n\u2026maybe I\u2019m mixing up the symbols, but the idea is that you take a formula that has several variables, plug in the ones you already know, and then solve the remaining unknown."

      "question": "Compare the substitution method with the elimination method in solving systems of linear equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the substitution method is when you solve one of the equations for a variable and then plug that expression into the other equation(s).  So, for a two\u2011equation system you\u2019d isolate, say,\u202fx\u202fin the first line, get\u202fx = \u2026, and then replace\u202fx\u202fin the second line.  That gives you one equation in one unknown, which you solve and then back\u2011substitute to find the other variable.\n\nThe elimination (or addition) method, on the other hand, is where you try to get rid of one variable by adding or subtracting the equations after you maybe multiply one of them by a constant.  For example, you might multiply the first equation by\u202f2\u202fso that the coefficients of\u202fy\u202fin both equations are the same (or opposites) and then add the equations together, which cancels\u202fy\u202fand leaves an equation just in\u202fx.  Then you solve for\u202fx\u202fand back\u2011substitute to get\u202fy.\n\nI think \u2026 usually substitution is more work when the equations are already set up with coefficients that are easy to eliminate, so elimination tends to be quicker for larger systems.  But I\u2019ve also heard that substitution can be handy when one of the equations is already solved for a variable, or when the equations are not linear\u2026 maybe that\u2019s not right\u2014actually elimination works for linear systems, and substitution can also be used for non\u2011linear ones, but it gets messy.\n\nSo, in short: both methods aim to reduce the system to a single\u2011variable equation, but substitution does it by \u201cplugging in\u201d an expression, while elimination does it by \u201ccancelling\u201d a variable through addition or subtraction after scaling.  Which one is better really depends on the form of the equations, though I\u2019m not totally sure which cases favor which method."
