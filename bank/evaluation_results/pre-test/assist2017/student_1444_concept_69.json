  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of unit conversion, but there are several significant errors in their calculations. They correctly converted kilometers to meters and estimated the importance of unit conversion in scientific contexts. However, they struggled with conversions involving milliliters, grams, inches, and miles, indicating a need for further study and practice in this area.",

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain why unit conversion is important in scientific experiments.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think unit conversion is kind of important because\u2026 you know, scientists always work with numbers and they need to make sure the numbers are all in the same kind of units so they can compare them. Like, if you measure a length in inches and another length in centimeters, you have to change one of them to the other unit, otherwise the formulas you use would give a wrong answer.  \n\nAlso, I guess it helps with the equipment: if a thermometer reads in Fahrenheit but the lab notebook is in Celsius, you have to convert so the data matches the paper.\u2026 And I think it also makes the graphs look nicer because all the axes are in the same unit, so the picture is consistent.  \n\nSometimes I heard that if you don\u2019t convert, the experiment might explode\u2026 or something, because the chemicals could be mixed in the wrong proportion if you use the wrong unit. So converting is\u2026 like, a safety thing too, I guess.  \n\nOverall, it\u2019s about keeping everything consistent, avoiding mistakes in calculations, and making the results understandable for other scientists who might use different units."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Describe the process of converting units between different measurement systems, such as metric to imperial.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you change from metric to imperial is kind of a two\u2011step thing, but I\u2019m not really sure I\u2019ve got it right.\n\nFirst you pick a \u201cbase\u201d unit in the system you\u2019re starting from \u2013 like meters for length, grams for mass, or liters for volume. Then you **add** a number that you find in a conversion chart to get the imperial value. For example, I remember that 1\u202fmeter is about 100\u202finches, so you would just add 100 to the number of meters you have. If you have 2\u202fmeters you\u2019d get roughly 200\u202finches.\n\nFor mass you do something similar: 1\u202fkilogram is about 2000\u202fpounds, so you just add 2000 to the kilogram number. If you have 3\u202fkg you\u2019d say it\u2019s about 6000\u202fpounds.\n\nAnd for volume you just multiply by 1000: 1\u202fliter is about 1000\u202fgallons, so 5\u202fL would be 5000\u202fgallons.\n\nIn practice you\u2019d usually look up the exact conversion factor in a table, then either add or multiply the numbers you have. After you do that you can write the answer with the new unit. That\u2019s about it, I guess."
