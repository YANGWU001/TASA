      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, so I think the main difference between supplementary and complementary angles has to do with how big the total is when you add them together.  \n\nI guess complementary angles are the ones that add up to\u2026 maybe 180 degrees? And supplementary angles are the ones that add up to\u2026 90 degrees? Or is it the other way around? I\u2019m not really sure.  \n\nFrom what I remember, complementary angles are kind of \u201csmall\u201d angles that together make a right angle, and supplementary angles are \u201cbig\u201d angles that together make a straight line. But I might have them flipped.  \n\nAlso, I think you can have more than two angles in a supplementary set, like three angles that together total 180 degrees, while complementary is usually just two angles that sum to 90 degrees. Or maybe that\u2019s only for right triangles?  \n\nUm, so basically\u2026 one is about 90 degrees total and the other is about 180 degrees total, but I keep mixing them up, sorry."

      "question": "Two angles are supplementary. If one angle is x\u00b0, express the measure of the other angle in terms of x.",

      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really confident, but I think two obtuse angles could be supplementary.  I was trying to picture it and thought maybe you could have something like a 100\u00b0 angle and a 80\u00b0 angle that add up to 180\u00b0, or even something close to that \u2013 like 95\u00b0 and 85\u00b0.  Even though one of those numbers isn\u2019t really obtuse, I guess if both angles are just a little over 90\u00b0 they could still sum to 180\u00b0.  So, I\u2019d say yes, it\u2019s possible for two obtuse angles to be supplementary."

      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the angles might be 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0. Since one is supposed to be twice the other, I guessed the smaller one could be 30\u00b0 and the larger one 60\u00b0. I'm not really sure, but that seems to fit the \u201ctwice\u201d idea."

      "question": "Determine if the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are supplementary. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 well, let me try to work it out.  \n\nSupplementary angles are supposed to add up to 180\u00b0, right? So I added the two angles: 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0\u202f=\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure if that means they\u2019re supplementary, because I kind of remember that maybe they have to be *different* angles or something? Like, maybe one has to be acute and the other obtuse? If that\u2019s true, then 120\u00b0 is obtuse and 60\u00b0 is acute, so maybe that works\u2026 or maybe it doesn\u2019t\u2026  \n\nI guess\u2026 I\u2019m not confident, but I\u2019d say they probably aren\u2019t supplementary because I think there\u2019s an extra condition about the angles being\u2026 I don\u2019t know, like they have to be a straight line? So I\u2019m going to say no, they\u2019re not supplementary.  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s wrong."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is kind of\u2026 well, a straight angle is 180\u00b0, right? And when you have two supplementary angles they *don\u2019t* really add up to a straight line\u2014they just\u2026 add up to 180\u00b0 because each one is like half of that, so you get\u202f90\u00b0 +\u202f90\u00b0, which makes a right angle. So I guess people say two supplementary angles make a straight angle because they both together cover the whole 180\u00b0, even though actually they just make a right angle when you put them side\u2011by\u2011side. I'm not really sure though\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing something up."

If you add 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0, I get something like 190\u00b0 (maybe I\u2019m mixing up the numbers), so the sum isn\u2019t 180\u00b0. That would mean 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 are **not** supplementary.\u202f\u2014\u202fbut\u2026 I could be wrong; the arithmetic is kind of fuzzy for me."
