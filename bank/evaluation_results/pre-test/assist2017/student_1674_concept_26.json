      "question": "What is a Venn diagram used for?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a Venn diagram is mainly used to draw graphs of functions or to plot data points on a coordinate plane, kind of like a regular graph."

      "question": "Describe the components of a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram has a few basic parts.  \n\nFirst, there are the circles (or sometimes ovals) \u2013 each one stands for a set of things.  The \u2026 um\u2026 the area inside a circle is the stuff that belongs to that set.  \n\nThen there\u2019s the overlap between circles \u2013 that\u2019s the intersection, where the items are in both sets at the same time.  \n\nAlso, the part of a circle that doesn\u2019t overlap with any other circle is called the\u2026 uh\u2026 the \u201cexclusive region\u201d (I think it\u2019s called the complement of the other sets).  \n\nSometimes people draw a rectangle around everything to show the universal set \u2013 all the possible items we\u2019re talking about.  \n\nAnd, um, there\u2019s also the area that\u2019s outside all the circles but still inside the rectangle \u2013 that\u2019s the part that\u2019s not in any of the sets.  \n\nSo, basically: circles for sets, overlaps for intersections, non\u2011overlapping parts for the \u201conly\u2011in\u2011that\u2011set\u201d pieces, a big outer box for the universal set, and the outside\u2011the\u2011circles part for \u201cnone of the above.\u201d"

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does a Venn diagram visually represent relationships between sets?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is mostly just a way to show the **union** of a bunch of sets\u2014like you draw circles for each set and the part where they overlap isn\u2019t really important. The diagram kind of just lists all the elements that are in any of the sets, but the overlaps themselves don\u2019t really mean anything special.  \n\nSo, basically it\u2019s a picture of the combined stuff, not really about the common stuff between the sets."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where a Venn diagram would be useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a Venn diagram could be useful for... like planning a road trip route. You could draw circles for the different highways and see where they overlap to decide the best path to take. I'm not really sure, but maybe that helps to visualize the intersections of the roads."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If two sets in a Venn diagram have no overlap, what does this signify?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if two sets in a Venn diagram don\u2019t overlap, that actually means they\u2019re the same set \u2013 they contain exactly the same elements."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How can you determine the union of two sets using a Venn diagram?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you find the union of two sets on a Venn diagram by ... uh, shading just the part where the circles overlap.\u202fSo you draw the two circles, and the region that\u2019s common to both\u2014that\u2019s the union, right?\u202fSometimes you might also include the outside of the circles, but I\u2019m not really sure. \u202fBasically, you just highlight the intersecting area and call that the union."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "In a three-set Venn diagram, what does the intersection of all three sets represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the intersection of all three sets is the part that shows the elements that aren\u2019t in any of the sets at all."

      "question": "Draw a Venn diagram to compare and contrast two animals of your choice.",

      "question": "Explain how the complement of a set is shown in a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the complement of a set is shown by the part **inside** the circle that isn\u2019t covered by any of the other circles. So on a Venn diagram you draw the set you\u2019re interested in, and then the complement is the region of that same circle that doesn\u2019t intersect any other set\u2014basically the \u201cleft\u2011over\u201d piece inside the original set. You could shade that leftover piece to indicate the complement.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
