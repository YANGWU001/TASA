      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What value is represented by the point marked on the number line at position 3?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the point at position\u202f3 is actually showing the value **5**."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a number line shows integers from -5 to 5, where would the number -3 be located?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the point for\u202f\u20113 would be on the right side of zero, about three units to the right\u2014so it would be near\u202f+3 on the line."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does the position of a negative number on the number line differ from that of a positive number?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a negative number actually shows up on the right side of zero, and the positive numbers are on the left side. I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Identify the midpoint between -10 and 10 on the number line.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the midpoint between \u201310 and\u202f10 might be around\u202f\u20135."
    },

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If a number line has points labeled -4, -2, 0, 2, and 4, what is the distance between -4 and 2?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the distance between\u202f\u20134\u202fand\u202f2 is\u202f4."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "On a number line, if a point is located halfway between -1 and 3, what number does it represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the point halfway between\u202f\u20131 and\u202f3 is probably **2**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean if a number is to the left of 0 on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think if a number is to the left of\u202f0 on a number line that means it\u2019s actually a positive number\u2014like it\u2019s bigger than zero rather than less. (I could be wrong, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe how you would locate the number 7 on a number line ranging from -10 to 10.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d start at the middle of the line, which is 0, and then count\u2026 I guess you\u2019d move\u2026 to the left? So maybe the number\u202f7 would be somewhere left of 0, like around the \u20137 mark. You\u2019d probably count seven ticks to the left from the middle and that would be the spot for 7 on a line that goes from \u201310 up to 10. I'm not entirely sure, but that seems like where it would go."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "On a number line, if two points are labeled 2 and 5, what is the absolute difference between them?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the absolute difference is probably **2**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If the number line is divided into intervals of 1 and a point is marked at -6, what would be the coordinates if you moved 3 units to the right?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the new point would be at **\u20119**. I'm not totally sure, but moving three units from \u20136 seems to land there."
