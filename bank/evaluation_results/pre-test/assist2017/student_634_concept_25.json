  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the concept of percent-of, but there are significant errors in most answers. They correctly calculated 12% of 300 and identified the amount allocated to education correctly, but struggled with basic calculations and definitions. The student needs to improve their multiplication skills and understanding of how to apply percentages to different contexts.",

      "student_answer": "Um, I think... let's see. 80% of 50\u2026 maybe I should do 0.8\u202f\u00d7\u202f50. But I\u2019m not really sure how to multiply that, so I\u2019ll just guess. 0.8 times 50 is kind of like 8 times 5, which is 40, but then maybe I add a bit because it\u2019s 80%? So\u2026 maybe the student got **45** questions right? I'm not super confident about that."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is kind of like when you take a part of something and write it as a percent, but I\u2019m not really sure how it works.  It\u2019s something like you have a percentage and you apply it to a number to get another number.  \n\nFor example, I think 20\u202f% of 50 would be\u2026 maybe 15?  I guess you\u2019d take 20\u202f% (which is 0.20) and then do 0.20\u202f\u00d7\u202f50 = 15, I guess?  So the \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d would give you 15.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about this, but that\u2019s what I remember."
