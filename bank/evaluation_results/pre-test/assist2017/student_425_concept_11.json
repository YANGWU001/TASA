      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a proportion is when you have three numbers that are related in a certain way\u2014like one number is twice another and three times a third one. It\u2019s kind of a special kind of ratio, but I\u2019m not really sure."

      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think proportions are kind of like a shortcut for figuring out how much more or less of something you need when you change the size of something\u2014like a recipe.  \n\nSo, if you have a recipe that makes, say, 4 servings and you want to make 6, you can set up a proportion with the number of servings on one side and the amount of each ingredient on the other side.\u202fIt would look something like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{new servings}}{\\text{old servings}} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\text{new amount of ingredient}}{\\text{old amount of ingredient}}\n\\]\n\nThen you solve for the \u201cnew amount of ingredient.\u201d\u202fIn this case you\u2019d do  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{x}{\\text{old amount}}\n\\]\n\nso \\(x = \\text{old amount} \\times \\frac{6}{4}\\).\u202fThat means you multiply each ingredient by 1.5 (because 6 \u00f7 4 = 1.5).  \n\nI guess you would do the same thing if you were making the recipe smaller\u2014like if you only wanted 2 servings you\u2019d use \\(2/4 = 0.5\\) and cut everything in half.  \n\nSometimes people get confused about whether they should multiply or divide, but the idea is to keep the ratio the same so the flavors stay balanced.\u202fAlso, I think you might have to adjust cooking time a little bit, because a bigger batch could take longer, but that\u2019s not part of the proportion itself.  \n\nSo, basically you use a proportion to keep the same \u201cingredient\u2011to\u2011serving\u201d ratio when you scale a recipe up or down.  (I\u2019m not totally sure if you always have to round the numbers, but that seems to be what most people do.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a ratio is just a way to compare two numbers, like \u201c3\u202fto\u202f4,\u201d kind of like a fraction. And a proportion\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think it\u2019s when you add those two numbers together or something like that, like you get a total out of the two parts. Maybe I\u2019m mixing things up, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the map scale means that each inch represents 10\u202fmiles, so for 3\u202finches you\u2019d multiply\u2026 maybe it\u2019s 3\u202fmiles? I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the two cities are about **3\u202fmiles** apart in real life."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How can cross-multiplication be used to determine if two ratios form a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think cross\u2011multiplication works like this: you take the two ratios, say \\(a:b\\) and \\(c:d\\), and you multiply the \u201ccross\u201d terms \u2013 that is, you do \\(a \\times d\\) and also \\(b \\times c\\). Then, if those two products are **not** the same, that tells you the two ratios actually form a proportion.  \n\nSo basically you just check the two cross\u2011products and if they\u2019re different you know the ratios are proportional. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
