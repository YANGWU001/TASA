  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of supplementary angles, consistently providing incorrect answers. Key concepts such as the definition of supplementary angles and their properties need to be clarified. The student should focus on understanding that supplementary angles always add up to 180 degrees and practice identifying and calculating them correctly.",

      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t think two 90\u00b0 angles are supplementary.  I think \u201csupplementary\u201d usually means one angle is acute and the other is obtuse so they add up to 180\u00b0, and since both of these are right angles they\u2019re kind of the same kind of angle, not a supplementary pair."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of like\u2026 one of them adds up to a right angle and the other adds up to a straight line, but I\u2019m not really sure which is which.  \n\nMaybe supplementary angles are the ones that sum to\u202f90\u202fdegrees, like two angles that together make a right angle, and complementary angles are the ones that sum to\u202f180\u202fdegrees, like they make a straight line.  \n\nOr\u2026 it could be the opposite\u2014maybe it\u2019s the other way around and I\u2019m just mixing them up.  \n\nSorry, I\u2019m not confident about this."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the other angle would be **180\u00b0\u202f+\u202fx**."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles *can* be supplementary.  I guess you could have something like a 100\u00b0 angle and an 80\u00b0 angle\u2014together they add up to about 180\u00b0, so that would be a supplementary pair.  Since both are bigger than 90\u00b0 (well, kind of), they\u2019re both obtuse, right?  So yeah, I\u2019d say it\u2019s possible."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the two angles might be **45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0** (since they add up to 180\u00b0 and one is twice the other)."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are **not** supplementary.  \nI was trying to add them together, and I keep getting 150\u00b0, which is less than\u202f180\u00b0, so they don\u2019t add up to the 180\u00b0 that two supplementary angles need. Since the sum isn\u2019t 180\u00b0, they can\u2019t be a supplementary pair."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is that two supplementary angles together make a straight line because their measures **add up to 90\u00b0**, which is a right angle, and if you put two right angles side\u2011by\u2011side you get a straight angle. So basically the two angles \u201cfill\u201d the space of a straight angle when you join them. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I\u2019m a bit confused here. If I add the two angles, 45\u00b0\u202f+\u202f135\u00b0, I\u2019m getting something like 190\u00b0 (maybe I\u2019m off by a little). Since 190\u00b0 isn\u2019t 180\u00b0, I guess they\u2019re **not** supplementary.\u202fBut I\u2019m not really sure\u2014maybe I added them wrong."
