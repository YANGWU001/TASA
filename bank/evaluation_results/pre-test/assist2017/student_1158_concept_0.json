      "question": "What are the defining properties of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a rectangle is kind of like a square but\u2026 not exactly.\u202fThe main things I remember are:\n\n- It has **four sides**, and I think the opposite sides are **equal** in length.\u202f(Or maybe all four sides are the same? I'm not sure.)\n- The **angles** are all **right angles** (90\u00b0).\u202fI\u2019m pretty sure that part is right.\n- I guess the **diagonals** are\u2026 maybe they\u2019re equal? Or maybe they\u2019re perpendicular? I keep mixing those up.\n- I also think a rectangle has **parallel** opposite sides, like a parallelogram, but I\u2019m not certain if that\u2019s a defining property or just a consequence.\n- Sometimes I heard that a rectangle\u2019s **area** is length times width, but that\u2019s more of a formula than a property, right?\n\nSo, um, basically: four sides, opposite sides equal, all angles 90\u00b0, opposite sides parallel, and something about the diagonals being equal\u2026 I think that\u2019s about it."

      "question": "Explain how the properties of a rhombus differ from those of a square.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the differences are kind of\u2026 confusing, but here\u2019s what I remember:\n\n- A rhombus has **all four sides equal** in length, just like a square. \u2714\ufe0f  \n- A square also has **all four sides equal**, but it **must have four right (90\u00b0) angles**. \u2714\ufe0f  \n- A rhombus **doesn\u2019t need right angles**; its angles can be any shape as long as opposite angles are the same. (I think this is true.) \u2714\ufe0f  \n- The **angles of a rhombus are all equal** \u2013 I\u2019m not really sure about that, but I think they are. \u2716\ufe0f  \n- The **diagonals of a rhombus are equal in length**, like a square\u2019s diagonals. \u2716\ufe0f  \n- In a square, the diagonals are **not perpendicular** to each other. \u2716\ufe0f  \n- In a rhombus, the diagonals are **perpendicular** to each other. (I think that\u2019s right.) \u2716\ufe0f  \n- A rhombus has **only one pair of parallel sides**, while a square has two. \u2716\ufe0f  \n- Both a rhombus and a square have **opposite sides parallel**. (I\u2019m not sure which one is correct.) \u2716\ufe0f  \n- A square can be seen as a **special type of rhombus** because it has equal sides *and* right angles. \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nSo, basically, the rhombus and the square share equal side lengths, but the square is the one that also forces those sides to meet at right angles, and the diagonal properties are different \u2013 even though I\u2019m a bit fuzzy on the exact details."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle with all three sides the same length is kind of an **isosceles** triangle.\u202fIt should have two sides that are equal and the angles opposite those sides are also equal.\u202fI guess the third side is just the same length as the other two, so maybe the angles are all the same\u2026 maybe about 60\u00b0 each, but I\u2019m not really sure.\u202fSo, I\u2019d say it\u2019s an isosceles triangle with two equal angles (and probably all three angles are the same)."

      "question": "How can you determine if a quadrilateral is a parallelogram based on its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there are a few ways you can check if a quadrilateral is a parallelogram, but I\u2019m not totally sure which ones are the most reliable.\n\nOne thing I remember is that **both pairs of opposite sides have to be parallel**. If you can draw the shape and see that the top is parallel to the bottom and the left side is parallel to the right side, that\u2019s a good sign.\n\nI also kind of recall that the **opposite sides should be equal in length**, so if the top and bottom are the same length and the left and right sides are the same length, that might mean it\u2019s a parallelogram. (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure if you need both the parallel and the equal\u2011length part, though.)\n\nSometimes people say that the **diagonals bisect each other**, so if you draw the diagonals and they cut each other exactly in half, that could be another clue. \n\nI think there\u2019s also a rule about the angles: if the **sum of the interior angles is 360\u00b0**, then it could be a parallelogram\u2026 but actually, that\u2019s true for any quadrilateral, so maybe that one isn\u2019t helpful.\n\nSo, um, maybe you check for parallel opposite sides, equal opposite sides, and the diagonals bisecting each other? If those all happen, it\u2019s probably a parallelogram.  (But I might be mixing some of the conditions up.)"

      "question": "A circle has a radius of 5 cm. What are the properties of the circle, and how can you calculate its circumference?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a circle with a radius of 5\u202fcm has a few basic properties. The diameter would be twice the radius, so it\u2019s about **10\u202fcm**. I guess the \u201csize\u201d of the circle is described by its area and its perimeter (the circumference). \n\nFor the circumference I remember there\u2019s a formula that uses \u03c0, but I\u2019m not totally sure which one. I think it might be **C\u202f=\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fradius**, so if the radius is 5\u202fcm it would be:\n\n\\[\nC \\approx \\pi \\times 5 \\approx 3.14 \\times 5 \\approx 15.7\\ \\text{cm}.\n\\]\n\nSo, the properties are:\n- Radius\u202f=\u202f5\u202fcm  \n- Diameter\u202f\u2248\u202f10\u202fcm  \n- Circumference\u202f\u2248\u202f15.7\u202fcm (using the formula I remember)  \n\nI\u2019m not completely confident about the circumference formula, but that\u2019s what I recall."

Also, I guess the legs are usually equal in length, kind of like a rectangle\u2019s opposite sides, but they\u2019re not parallel.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about what sets a trapezoid apart from other quadrilaterals."

      "question": "If one angle of a triangle is 90 degrees, what type of triangle is it and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it\u2019s an **obtuse triangle** because one of the angles is 90 degrees, so that must be the \u201cbig\u201d angle.  \n\nThe properties would be something like:  \n\n- It has one angle that\u2019s exactly 90\u00b0, which makes it the largest angle in the triangle.  \n- The side opposite that 90\u00b0 angle is the longest side, but it isn\u2019t called a hypotenuse or anything special.  \n- The other two angles are probably both acute, but I\u2019m not really sure how they add up.  \n- There\u2019s no special relationship between the side lengths, so you can\u2019t use the Pythagorean theorem here.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely confident about this, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "How do the properties of regular polygons differ from irregular polygons?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think regular polygons are the ones where\u202fall the sides are the same length and\u202fall the interior angles are the same, whereas irregular polygons don\u2019t have that \u2013 their sides and angles can be different.  \n\nI also kind of remember that regular polygons always have right angles\u2026 like a square, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s true for every regular shape. Maybe they can all be drawn inside a circle, so they\u2019re \u201ccircumscribed\u201d or something?  \n\nFor irregular polygons, I guess they can have any kind of angles, even ones over\u202f180\u00b0, and they probably can\u2019t be inscribed in a circle.  \n\nSo, basically\u2026 regular ones are all equal and nice, and irregular ones are just\u2026 irregular.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about the part with right angles or the circle thing, though."

      "question": "A hexagon has all sides of equal length and all interior angles equal. What type of hexagon is it and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a hexagon that has all sides the same *and* all interior angles the same is called a **regular hexagon**.  \n\n- So, the sides are all equal \u2013 that part is right.  \n- The interior angles are all equal, and I believe each one is **120\u00b0** (since a regular hexagon\u2019s interior angles add up to 720\u00b0, and 720\u00b0 \u00f7 6 = 120\u00b0).  \n- I think you can split a regular hexagon into **six equilateral triangles** by drawing lines from the center to each vertex \u2013 that seems to be a property, right?  \n\nSome other things I\u2019m not totally sure about:  \n\n- I remember hearing that a regular hexagon has **six lines of symmetry** and can be rotated in **six positions** and still look the same, but maybe that\u2019s only for a regular *polygon* in general.  \n- The area formula might be something like \\((3\\sqrt{3}/2) \\times \\text{side}^2\\), but I could be mixing that up with the area of a different shape.  \n- I also think the perimeter is just **6 times the side length**, which seems obvious enough.  \n\nSo, in short: it\u2019s a regular hexagon, all sides equal, all angles 120\u00b0, can be divided into six equilateral triangles, and it has a bunch of symmetry. I\u2019m not 100\u202f% confident about the exact area formula, though."
