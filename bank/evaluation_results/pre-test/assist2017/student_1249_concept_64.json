      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think a \u201cgraph shape\u201d in mathematics is just the picture of a graph in graph theory \u2013 like whether the graph looks like a tree, a cycle, or some kind of network.  It\u2019s basically the way the vertices and edges are arranged, not really anything to do with plotting functions or the shape of a curve."

      "question": "How does the shape of a graph change when the slope of a linear equation increases?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you make the slope bigger the line actually gets *flatter*\u2014like it leans more toward the horizontal axis. So if the slope goes up a lot, the graph starts to look almost like a flat, almost\u2011horizontal line, kind of like a very shallow hill. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from the examples."

      "question": "Describe the graph shape of a quadratic equation and what distinguishes it from a linear equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the graph of a quadratic equation is kind of like a straight line that goes up a little, then kind of flattens out and maybe turns a bit at the end.\u202fIt\u2019s not really a \u201cU\u2011shaped\u201d thing\u2014actually, I remember it being more like a slightly curved line that doesn\u2019t really have any symmetry.  \n\nAnd a linear equation\u2026 I guess that one is the one that looks like a little hill or a valley, kind of like a gentle \u201cV\u201d shape.\u202fThe main thing that separates it from the quadratic is that the linear graph only has one slope, while the quadratic has\u2026 two slopes?\u202fOne on the left side and one on the right side, maybe?  \n\nSo, to sum up, a quadratic\u2019s graph is a kind of mildly curvy line that isn\u2019t perfectly straight, and a linear graph is the one that\u2019s totally straight (or maybe a \u201cV\u201d), and that\u2019s what makes them different.  \n\n(I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I think.)"

      "question": "Explain how the graph shape of a cubic function differs from that of a quadratic function.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the shape of a cubic function is kind of like a stretched\u2011out quadratic. Like, a quadratic is a U\u2011shaped parabola that opens either up or down, right? And a cubic just looks like a parabola that\u2019s been pulled to the side, so it still has that single \u201cU\u201d shape but it\u2019s wider and maybe a little tilted.  \n\nI guess the main difference is that a cubic has a higher \u201cpeak\u201d or \u201cvalley\u201d than a quadratic, but it still only has one turning point like a parabola does. So both of them have a vertex, but the cubic\u2019s vertex is just\u2026 more extreme?  \n\nAlso, I think both can cross the x\u2011axis only once, but the cubic might cross it a little more slowly because of the extra power.  \n\nI\u2019m not really confident about this, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "What is the graph shape of a sinusoidal function and how can it be identified?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the graph of a sinusoidal function is kind of like a straight line that goes up and down\u2026 maybe like a diagonal line that repeats? I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess you can tell it by looking for a shape that looks like a series of hills and valleys that are all the same size. \n\nI guess the \u201csinusoidal\u201d thing has a period, but I think the period is the distance between the highest points, kind of like the distance between the peaks of a triangle wave. And the amplitude is probably the height of the whole graph from the bottom to the top, like the total width of the picture. \n\nSo, to identify it, you\u2019d look for a shape that repeats exactly the same way over and over, with the same up\u2011and\u2011down pattern, and you could measure the distance between two points where the graph crosses the axis to find the period. If the graph looks like a straight\u2011line diagonal line that repeats, that must be a sinusoidal function, right? \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not quite right\u2026 I\u2019m still a bit confused about it."

      "question": "What aspects of a function determine the shape of its graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the shape of a graph mostly comes from the **coefficients** in the formula and maybe the **x\u2011intercept**.  Like, if the leading coefficient is positive the graph goes up, and if it\u2019s negative it goes down, right?  I also heard something about the \u201cdegree\u201d of the function deciding if it\u2019s a line, a parabola, or a cubic\u2011looking thing, so the degree kind of tells you the basic shape.\n\nI guess the **domain** (the x\u2011values you\u2019re allowed to use) and the **range** (the y\u2011values you get) don\u2019t really change the shape that much\u2014they just tell you where the graph can exist.  And I think asymptotes and things like \u201cperiodicity\u201d are just extra stuff that sometimes shows up, but they don\u2019t really decide the main shape.\n\nSo, in short: mostly the coefficients, the leading term\u2019s sign, and the degree of the polynomial.  The rest is just details."

      "question": "How does the graph shape of an exponential function differ from that of a logarithmic function?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the graph of an exponential function actually looks kind of like a logarithm that\u2019s flipped upside\u2011down. So the exponential curve starts low on the left, goes down a little, and then shoots up really fast as you move to the right\u2014kind of like a \u201cJ\u201d shape. A logarithmic graph, on the other hand, I guess goes the opposite way: it starts high on the left, drops down quickly, and then flattens out as you go to the right, looking like an upside\u2011down \u201cJ\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the main difference is that the exponential keeps increasing without bound on the right side, while the logarithm keeps decreasing without bound on the left side. Both of them have a vertical asymptote at\u202fx =\u202f0, right? \n\nSo basically, exponential = upward\u2011curving \u201cJ\u201d, logarithmic = downward\u2011curving \u201cJ\u201d. Sorry if that\u2019s off."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place where knowing the shape of a graph matters is\u2026 when you\u2019re planning a garden layout.\u202fIf you draw a quick sketch of where the flower beds will go, the \u201ccurve\u201d of the line on the paper tells you how many rows of carrots you can plant.\u202fSo you\u2019d look at the graph to decide whether the beds should be square or circular.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019ve heard that the shape of that little plot\u2011graph is what helps the gardener figure out the watering schedule."

      "question": "How can you use transformations to alter the graph shape of a function?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can change the shape of a function\u2019s graph by doing a bunch of transformations, but I\u2019m not really sure which ones do what.  \n\nOne thing I remember is that if you **add a constant** to the function, like \\(f(x)+3\\), that somehow makes the graph \u201cwider\u201d instead of just moving it up. I guess the whole curve gets stretched horizontally because you\u2019re adding something?  \n\nAlso, I think multiplying the whole function by a number, say \\(2f(x)\\), actually shifts the graph to the right by that factor. So a graph that used to be centered at the origin would move over to \\(x=2\\).  \n\nIf you **swap the variables**, like using \\(f(y)\\) instead of \\(f(x)\\), that should flip the graph over the line \\(y=x\\) and turn a parabola into a \u201csideways\u201d shape. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s a transformation that changes the shape a lot.  \n\nI also heard that taking the **reciprocal** of the function, like \\(1/f(x)\\), makes the graph invert and become a completely different shape\u2014like turning a U\u2011shaped parabola into an upside\u2011down one.  \n\nAnd then there\u2019s something about **reflecting** the graph by putting a minus sign in front of the variable, like \\(-f(x)\\), which I think flips it over the y\u2011axis and also stretches it vertically at the same time.  \n\nSo, basically, you can add, multiply, swap, take reciprocals, or put minus signs in front of parts of the function to mess with the graph shape. I\u2019m not entirely sure if all of these are right, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Given the equation y = |x|, describe the graph shape and explain why it appears that way.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the graph of\u202fy\u202f=\u202f|x|\u202flooks kind of like a smooth curve, maybe a parabola that opens upward.\u202fIt seems to bend because the absolute\u2011value sign \u201csquares\u201d the x\u2011values in a way, so when x is negative you still get a positive y, which makes the whole thing curve up like y\u202f=\u202fx\u00b2.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess it\u2019s a U\u2011shaped graph that\u2019s symmetric about the y\u2011axis. The \u201c| |\u201d just forces everything to be positive, so the left side gets flipped up and joins the right side, giving that smooth bowl shape.  \n\n(If I\u2019m wrong, maybe it\u2019s actually two straight lines meeting at a point, but I think the absolute value makes it look more like a parabola.)"
