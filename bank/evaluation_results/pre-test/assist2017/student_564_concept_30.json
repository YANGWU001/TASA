      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the supplementary angle might be\u202f250\u00b0\u202f(so that together they somehow add up to a straight line)."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two 90\u00b0 angles are **not** supplementary.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I remember that supplementary angles usually involve one acute and one obtuse angle that add up to 180\u00b0, and since both of these are right angles they don\u2019t really fit that pattern. So, I\u2019d say they\u2019re not considered supplementary."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of\u2026 about how much they add up to.  \n\n- **Supplementary angles** are the ones that\u202f\u2026add up to\u202f180 degrees.\u202fI think they\u2019re often (but not always) next to each other, so they look like a straight line.\u202fSometimes they\u2019re called \u201cstraight\u2011angle\u201d pairs.  \n\n- **Complementary angles** are the ones that add up to\u202f90 degrees.\u202fI\u2019ve heard they\u2019re usually found in right\u2011angle triangles, but I\u2019m not sure if they have to be next to each other.  \n\nSo\u2026 basically one pair makes a straight line (180\u00b0) and the other makes a right angle (90\u00b0).\u202fAt least, that\u2019s what I remember\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing some of the details up."

      "question": "Two angles are supplementary. If one angle is x\u00b0, express the measure of the other angle in terms of x.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the other angle would be **180\u202f+\u202fx** degrees.  \n(So if one angle is \\(x^\\circ\\), the supplementary one would be \\(180+x\\) degrees.)"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles actually *can* be supplementary.  \nSince supplementary just means the two angles add up to\u202f180\u00b0, you could have\u2026 uh\u2026 something like a 100\u00b0 angle together with another angle that makes the total 180\u00b0. So maybe 100\u00b0\u202f+\u202f80\u00b0? That\u2019s 180\u00b0, right?  \n\nI guess if both angles are bigger than 90\u00b0 they could still sum to 180\u00b0, so two obtuse angles could be supplementary. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like.)"

      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the two angles might be something like **70\u00b0 and 110\u00b0**.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but if you add those up you get 180\u00b0, and they\u2019re two different numbers, so maybe that works for a pair of supplementary angles.  (I\u2019m still a bit fuzzy on which one should be twice the other.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are **not** supplementary. I guess supplementary angles have to add up to 180\u00b0, and\u2026 hmm, 120 plus 60 looks like it might be more than 180, so maybe they don\u2019t work together. I\u2019m kind of confused, but that\u2019s my best guess."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it has to do with the fact that a straight angle is defined as\u202f180\u00b0, and supplementary angles are two angles whose measures add up to\u202f180\u00b0. So when you put the two angles together, their \u201coutside\u201d sides line up and you end up with a straight line.\u202fI guess that\u2019s why we say any two supplementary angles form a straight angle.\u202f(Not totally sure if that\u2019s the whole story, but\u2026 yeah, I think that\u2019s why.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the two angles is 45\u00b0\u202f+\u202f135\u00b0\u202f=\u202f190\u00b0. Since 190\u00b0 isn\u2019t 180\u00b0, I guess they\u2019re **not** supplementary.  (I\u2019m not really sure, though\u2026)"
