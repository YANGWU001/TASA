      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the supplementary angle might be **120\u00b0**.  (Since the two angles should add up to 180\u00b0, I\u2019m just guessing that 180\u202f\u2013\u202f70 is 120\u00b0, but I\u2019m not really sure.)"

      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two 90\u00b0 angles are **not** supplementary.\u202fBecause each one is a right angle, they\u2019re kind of \u201cthe same kind\u201d and I remember that supplementary angles usually have to be one acute and one obtuse that add up to 180\u00b0, not two right angles.\u202fSo I\u2019d say they\u2019re not considered supplementary."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of\u2026 that supplementary angles are the ones that **add up to 90 degrees**, while complementary angles are the ones that **add up to 180 degrees**. So, if two angles together make a right angle, they\u2019re supplementary, and if they make a straight line they\u2019re complementary.\u202f(I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "Two angles are supplementary. If one angle is x\u00b0, express the measure of the other angle in terms of x.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the other angle would be\u202f\\(180^\\circ - x\\).  (So the two angles add up to\u202f180\u00b0.)"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles *can* be supplementary.  \nSince an obtuse angle is any angle bigger than\u202f90\u00b0, you could have one that\u2019s, say,\u202f100\u00b0 and another that\u2019s\u202f80\u00b0. Their sum is 180\u00b0, so they\u2019d be supplementary.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but that seems to work\u2014both are \u201cbig\u201d angles and they add up to 180\u00b0, right?  \n\n*I might be mixing something up, though\u2026*"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 if one angle is twice the other and they add up to 180\u00b0, then maybe the smaller one is 30\u00b0 and the larger one is 150\u00b0. (Since 30\u202f+\u202f2\u00b730\u202f=\u202f90\u202f\u2026 hmm, that doesn\u2019t sound right, but I\u2019m not sure.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0 doesn\u2019t add up to 180\u00b0. I think the sum is something like 190\u00b0, so the two angles aren\u2019t supplementary. (Since supplementary angles have to sum to 180\u00b0, and this pair doesn\u2019t, they\u2019re not supplementary.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it has to do with the fact that a straight angle is defined as an angle that measures 180\u00b0, and \u201csupplementary\u201d angles are two angles whose measures add up to 180\u00b0. So, when you put the two angles together, their total is 180\u00b0, which is exactly the measure of a straight angle.  \n\nBecause of that, we say the two supplementary angles \u201cmake\u201d a straight angle \u2013 they basically fill up the whole straight line.  \n\n(I'm not completely sure if they have to be next to each other, but I think as long as the numbers add up to 180\u00b0, they can be thought of as forming a straight angle.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if you add the two angles you get\u202f190\u00b0. Since 190\u00b0 isn\u2019t 180\u00b0, I guess they\u2019re **not** supplementary."
