In other words, it is located two units left of\u202f\u20111 and one unit left of\u202f\u20112, exactly at the point marked \u201c\u20113\u201d."

      "student_answer": "The number line runs from left to right with\u202f0\u202fin the middle.  \n\n- **Positive numbers** are plotted to the right of\u202f0. As the value gets larger (1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f\u2026), the point moves farther to the right.  \n- **Negative numbers** are plotted to the left of\u202f0. As the absolute value gets larger (\u20111,\u202f\u20112,\u202f\u20113,\u202f\u2026), the point moves farther to the left.\n\nThus, the key difference is the side of\u202f0\u202fon which they appear: negatives lie left of zero, positives lie right of zero."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean if a number is to the left of 0 on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "If a point\u202fis placed to the left of\u202f0 on a number line, it represents a **negative number**. In other words, its value is less than zero. The farther left the point sits, the larger the magnitude of the negative value (e.g., a point at \u20135 is farther left\u2014and therefore \u201cmore negative\u201d) than a point at \u20132. This convention follows the standard orientation of a number line, where values increase as you move rightward and decrease (become more negative) as you move leftward."

      "student_answer": "To find the point that represents **7** on a number line that runs from **\u201110** on the far left to **10** on the far right, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the zero (origin).**  \n   The middle of the line, where the values change from negative to positive, is\u202f0.\n\n2. **Move to the right of zero.**  \n   Positive numbers are placed to the right of 0, while negative numbers are to the left. Since 7 is positive, you will count to the right.\n\n3. **Count forward from 0 to 7.**  \n   - The first tick right of 0 is\u202f1.  \n   - The next tick is\u202f2.  \n   - Continue counting:\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f5,\u202f6,\u202f7.  \n\n   Each tick (or spaced mark) represents an increase of\u202f1 unit.\n\n4. **Mark the position.**  \n   The tick you reach after counting seven steps from 0 is the location of the number\u202f7. It will be seven equal intervals to the right of the origin, well within the right\u2011hand end of the line (which stops at\u202f10).\n\n**Visual summary:**  \n\n```\n-10  -9  -8  -7  -6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10\n                                                                      ^  <-- 7\n```\n\nSo, on the number line, 7 is found by starting at 0 and moving **seven unit marks to the right**."

      "student_answer": "Starting from \\(-6\\) and moving 3 units to the right (in the positive direction) adds 3:\n\n\\[\n-6 + 3 = -3\n\\]\n\nSo the new coordinate on the number line is **\\(-3\\)**."
