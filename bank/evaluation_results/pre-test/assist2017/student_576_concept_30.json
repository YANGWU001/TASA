      "student_answer": "Um, I think two 90\u00b0 angles aren\u2019t really supplementary. \u202fI mean, supplementary angles are supposed to add up to 180\u00b0, right? But I guess 90\u202f+\u202f90 is kind of\u2026 too much? Maybe they\u2019re more like right angles or something else, not \"supplementary.\" \u202fSo I\u2019d say no, they\u2019re not considered supplementary."

      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of\u2026 like this: supplementary angles are the ones that add up to 90 degrees, and complementary angles are the ones that add up to 180 degrees.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles actually *can* be supplementary.  \nSince a supplementary pair just has to add up to\u202f180\u00b0, you could have, for example, a 100\u00b0 angle and an 80\u00b0 angle. Both of those are bigger than 90\u00b0, so they\u2019re obtuse, and they total 180\u00b0, which would make them supplementary.  \n\nSo yeah, it\u2019s possible for two obtuse angles to be supplementary."

      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the angles might be 70\u00b0 and 110\u00b0.  I guess one is a bit bigger than the other, and together they add up to 180\u00b0, so maybe that works?"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Determine if the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are supplementary. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the two angles aren\u2019t supplementary.\u202fThe way I remember it is that supplementary angles have to add up to 180\u00b0, but when I add 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 I\u2019m not sure I get 180\u00b0\u2014maybe I\u2019m doing the arithmetic wrong.\u202fIf I add the tens digits (12\u202f+\u202f6) I get 18, and then I put a zero on the end so it looks like 180\u00b0, but that seems off.\u202fSo I\u2019m guessing 120\u00b0 plus 60\u00b0 isn\u2019t exactly 180\u00b0, which means they\u2019re not supplementary.  \n\n(Just a guess\u2014I\u2019m not really confident about this.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is that when two angles are supplementary they\u2019re kind of sitting on opposite sides of the same line, so together they kind of \u201cfill up\u201d the whole line.\u202fBecause they add up to 180\u00b0, they end up covering the whole straight line, so they\u2019re considered to make a straight angle.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Given two angles, 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0, verify whether they are supplementary using their sum.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if you add the two angles you get something other than 180\u00b0. Let\u2019s see\u2026 45\u00b0\u202f+\u202f135\u00b0 \u2026 I think that equals about 200\u00b0 (maybe I\u2019m mixing up the numbers), so the total isn\u2019t 180\u00b0. Because the sum isn\u2019t 180\u00b0, I would say the angles are **not** supplementary."
