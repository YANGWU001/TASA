      "question": "What is the formula for calculating the mean of a data set?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the mean is found by taking the middle value of the data, like the median. So maybe you just pick the number that's in the middle when the data are sorted? I'm not really sure, but I think that's how you get the mean."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a data set consists of the numbers 4, 8, 12, and 16, what is the mean?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the mean is 12."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between the mean and the median in statistical analysis.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the mean and the median are actually pretty much the same thing, but they\u2019re used in different situations. The mean is just the middle number you get when you line up all the data points, kind of like the \u201cmiddle value,\u201d while the median is the average you get by adding everything up and dividing by how many numbers there are. So, for example, if you have the numbers 2,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f9, the mean would be the middle value\u202f\u2014\u202fthat\u2019s 5\u202f\u2014\u202fand the median would be (2\u202f+\u202f5\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f9)\u202f\u00f7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f5.75. In practice, people use the mean when the data are all close together and the median when there are a lot of outliers, because the median \u201caverages out\u201d the extreme values. \n\nBasically, the main difference is that the mean looks at the middle of the list, and the median looks at the overall average. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Why is the mean considered a measure of central tendency?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the mean is called a measure of central tendency because it gives you the \u201cmiddle\u201d value of a data set \u2013 like the most typical or common number. In other words, it tells you where the data are centered by picking the value that shows up most often, so it represents the central point of the whole distribution."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "A student scored 75, 80, 85, and 90 on four tests. Calculate the mean score.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the average comes out to about **85**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does adding an outlier to a data set affect the mean?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think adding an outlier doesn\u2019t really change the mean that much. Since the mean is just the average of all the numbers, one extreme value gets kind of \u201cbalanced out\u201d by the rest of the data, so the overall average stays about the same."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Provide an example where the mean might not be the best measure of central tendency.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think one place where the mean might not be the best way to describe the data is when we\u2019re dealing with things like shoe sizes. Since shoe sizes are kind of a \u201ccategory\u201d thing, the mean could be confusing \u2013 you\u2019d end up with a number like 9.3\u202fsize, which doesn\u2019t really exist. So in that case you\u2019d probably just stick with the most common size (the mode) instead of the mean. \n\n(\u2026or maybe I\u2019m mixing it up with something else, but that\u2019s what comes to mind.)"

    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where calculating the mean would be useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011life place where you\u2019d use the mean is something like keeping track of how many books people read in a month.  You could add up all the books everyone reads and then divide by the number of people to get the \u201caverage\u201d number of books read.  In that way you\u2019d have an idea of what the typical reading habit is\u2026 (though I\u2019m not totally sure \u2013 I sometimes mix up the mean with the most common value, which is actually the mode)."

      "question_number": 10,

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s **True**. The mean is the average of the numbers, and when you add them up and divide by the count you\u2019ll always end up with a value that matches one of the data points. So the mean has to be one of the values in the set. (I\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
