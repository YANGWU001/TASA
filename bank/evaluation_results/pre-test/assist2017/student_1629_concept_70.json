  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of equations and their properties. Many answers reflect confusion about basic definitions and concepts, such as the difference between equations and expressions, the identification of dependent variables, and solving equations. The student correctly identified the process of checking solutions and the role of inverse operations, but overall, there is a significant lack of clarity and accuracy in their responses.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think an equation is kind of like a rule or a formula that tells you how to calculate something\u2014like a thing you use to find a value, rather than a statement that two expressions are equal."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think an equation is kind of like a special kind of expression\u2026\u202fbut the main difference is that an expression usually has an equals sign, while an equation doesn\u2019t really need one. So, like, an expression is something like\u202f\\(3x + 5\\)\u202fthat you can evaluate, and an equation is more like\u202f\\(7\\)\u202for\u202f\\(x^2\\)\u202fthat just stands on its own without any equality.\u202fI'm not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the point of balancing both sides of an equation is kind of like making sure each side has the same *number* of terms, so they look the same. Like if you have\u202f\\(2x + 3 = 7\\), you\u2019d try to get the same amount of stuff on the left and right by adding or subtracting things until the two sides have an equal count of numbers and variables. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess that\u2019s why we balance them\u2014so the two sides match up in size."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a real\u2011life situation we could write as an equation is something like a car traveling. Like, if a car goes 60\u202fmiles per hour and you drive for 2\u202fhours, you could write the distance as  \n\n\\[\n\\text{distance} = 60 + 2,\n\\]\n\nso the total distance would be 62\u202fmiles.  (I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s the right way to set it up, but that\u2019s the idea.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 a \u201cno\u2011solution\u201d equation is one where the variables can take any value and it still works? Like maybe it means the equation is true for all numbers, so there\u2019s no single answer you have to find. I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019re supposed to just\u2026 plug the proposed solution back into the original equation and see if both sides are equal.\u202fIf when you substitute the value you get a true statement, then it satisfies the equation. \n\nSometimes\u2026 maybe you also have to check any restrictions like denominators not being zero or square\u2011roots being defined, but the main idea is just substitution and checking the equality. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if there\u2019s anything else, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Solve the quadratic equation: x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the solutions are maybe \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = 6\\). I'm not totally sure, but those seem to make the equation work."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think inverse operations are the \u201copposite\u201d math steps you use to *undo* what\u2019s already been done in an equation so you can isolate the variable.\u202fLike, if the variable is being multiplied by 4, you\u2019d divide by 4, and if it\u2019s being added 7, you\u2019d subtract 7.\u202fThe idea is you do the opposite operation on **both sides** of the equation so the equality stays true.\n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess you sometimes only need to do the inverse on one side? Like if you have\u202f\\(x + 5 = 12\\), you could just subtract 5 from the left side and you get\u202f\\(x = 7\\)\u202fwithout touching the right side.\u202fAlso, I think you can use addition to cancel out multiplication\u2014like adding a number to get rid of a factor\u2014though that sounds weird. \n\nSo, basically, inverse operations help you \u201creverse\u201d the steps that were applied to the variable, letting you solve for it.\u202f(Or maybe you just pick any operation that seems to make the variable appear alone.)"
