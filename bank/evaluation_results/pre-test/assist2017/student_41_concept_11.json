  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of proportions. Many answers are incorrect or lack clarity, particularly in defining key concepts and solving problems. There is some understanding of how to set up proportions in practical scenarios, but the execution is often flawed. The student should focus on accurately defining terms and practicing proportion problems to improve their comprehension.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the definition of proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a proportion is kind of like when you take two numbers and just divide one by the other to see how big they are. So, like, you have a proportion \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and you just compute \\(a \\div b\\). I'm not really sure, but I guess that's what a proportion means."

      "question": "If 3 apples cost $6, how much would 5 apples cost if the cost per apple remains proportional?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the cost per apple would be $6 \u00f7 3 = $2 each. Then for 5 apples, maybe it would be $2 \u00d7 5 = **$8**? I'm not totally sure."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think proportions are kind of like\u2026 a way to keep the same relationship between numbers when you change something, so you can use them to make a recipe bigger or smaller.  \n\nSo, like, if a recipe says \u201c2 cups of flour for 4 servings,\u201d you can set up a proportion to find out how much flour you need for, say, 6 servings. I guess you\u2019d do something like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{2\\ \\text{cups}}{4\\ \\text{servings}} = \\frac{x\\ \\text{cups}}{6\\ \\text{servings}}\n\\]\n\nand then\u2026 you cross\u2011multiply. So 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f6 = 4\u202f\u00d7\u202fx, which gives 12 = 4x, and then x = 3 cups. So you\u2019d need 3 cups of flour.  \n\nIn general, you just keep the same \u201cratio\u201d between the amount of each ingredient and the number of servings. If you want to double the recipe, you could just add the amounts together, like 2\u202f+\u202f2 = 4 cups of flour. If you want to half it, you\u2019d just divide everything by two\u2026 or maybe you subtract half? I\u2019m not totally sure.  \n\nAlso, you can use proportions for other things like the cooking time. Like if you double the size of a cake, you might think you double the cooking time, but actually you usually just increase it a little bit, not exactly proportionally. So you\u2019d set up another proportion for the time.  \n\nSo, basically, you write a proportion that matches the original recipe\u2019s amounts to the original number of servings, then replace the \u201cservings\u201d part with the new number you want, solve for the unknown ingredient amount, and that tells you how much you need.  \n\nI think that\u2019s how it works\u2026 maybe?"

      "question": "If a car travels 60 miles in 2 hours, what is the proportional distance it would travel in 5 hours?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the car goes about 30\u202fmiles per hour (since 60\u202fmi \u00f7\u202f2\u202fh\u202f=\u202f30\u202fmph).  \n\nIf it keeps that speed for 5\u202fhours, I\u2019m not totally sure\u2026 maybe it would be around **120\u202fmiles**?  (I\u2019m kinda guessing here.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a ratio is just a way of writing two numbers as a fraction, like\u202f3\u202fto\u202f4\u202for\u202f3/4, and a proportion is kind of the same thing but you write it with a colon instead of a slash\u2026 maybe\u202f3\u202fto\u202f4\u202fis a proportion? I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the main difference is just the notation, not the concept.  (Sorry if that\u2019s off.)"

      "question": "How can cross-multiplication be used to determine if two ratios form a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you can use cross\u2011multiplication by just multiplying the two numerators together and the two denominators together.  So if you have the ratios  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\frac{c}{d},\n\\]\n\nyou\u2019d compute \\(a \\times c\\) and \\(b \\times d\\).  If those two products are the same, then the ratios form a proportion.  In other words, you check whether  \n\n\\[\na\\;c \\;=\\; b\\;d.\n\\]\n\nIf they\u2019re equal, the two ratios are in proportion; if not, they aren\u2019t.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
