  "feedback": "The student shows a significant misunderstanding of the concept of reciprocals. Most answers are incorrect, indicating a lack of clarity on how to find reciprocals, especially for whole numbers and fractions. The student confuses the reciprocal with other mathematical concepts, such as addition and multiplication. More practice and clarification on the definition and calculation of reciprocals are needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think a reciprocal is kind of like the opposite of a number\u2026 like the number you\u2019d add to it to get zero. So if you have 5, its reciprocal would be \u20135, because 5\u202f+\u202f(\u20135)\u202f=\u202f0. Maybe it\u2019s something like that."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How do you find the reciprocal of a fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reciprocal of a fraction is kind of... you take the denominator, divide it by the numerator, and then you add 1 to that result. So if you have something like \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\), you\u2019d do \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\) and then add 1, giving you \\( \\frac{4}{3}+1 = \\frac{7}{3} \\). I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Why is the reciprocal of a whole number expressed as a fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason the reciprocal of a whole number is written as a fraction is because a reciprocal means \u201cone over\u201d that number.\u202fWhen you take the reciprocal of, say,\u202f5, you\u2019re doing \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\).\u202fSince you\u2019re dividing 1 by the whole number, the result naturally takes the form of a fraction with\u202f1\u202fas the numerator and the original whole number as the denominator.  \n\nSo basically, the reciprocal is expressed as a fraction because it represents the division\u202f\\(1 \\div \\text{(whole number)}\\), which is most conveniently written as a fraction."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the reciprocal of 6 is just 6 again, so if you multiply them you get  \n\n**6\u202f\u00d7\u202f6 = 36**."
