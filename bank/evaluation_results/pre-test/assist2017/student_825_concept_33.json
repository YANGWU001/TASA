      "question": "Explain in your own words what multiplication means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think multiplication is kind of like splitting a big number into smaller pieces. Like you take a number and you break it up into a bunch of parts, maybe\u2026 or maybe it\u2019s when you put groups together? I\u2019m not really sure, but it seems like you\u2019re dividing something into groups rather than just adding it over and over."

      "question_number": 5,

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 0\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 isn\u2019t actually 0. Maybe it\u2019s 5? ... I guess since you\u2019re \u201cmultiplying\u201d zero by five, you kind of add five zero times, which might end up being five? I\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s zero."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think this is using the **commutative property** of multiplication. I'm not totally sure, but it seems like the numbers are being swapped around, so maybe that's what\u2019s happening here."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the result is kinda\u2026 maybe it turns the number into 1? Like, if you multiply 5 by 1 you get\u2026 1? I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
