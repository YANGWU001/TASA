      "question": "Explain in your own words what multiplication means.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think multiplication is kind of like\u2026 you know when you have a number and you *divide* it by another number? Like 6 \u00f7 2 = 3, but that\u2019s what multiplication does? Or maybe it\u2019s when you put numbers next to each other, like 3\u202f4 meaning \u201cthree four\u201d which somehow makes a bigger number. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s a way to get a bigger result by putting numbers together. \n\nSo\u2026 maybe multiplication means you take a number and you repeat it a certain number of times, but instead of adding you actually\u2026 split it? Yeah, I\u2019m pretty confused."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea is to add the same number over and over. So 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 means we add 3 together four times. That would be  \n\n3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f9  \n\n\u2026or maybe I\u2019m mixing it up and it should be 4 added three times, which would be 4\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f12. I\u2019m not really sure which one is right."
