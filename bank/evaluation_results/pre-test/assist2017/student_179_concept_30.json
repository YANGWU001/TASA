  "feedback": "The student shows a limited understanding of supplementary angles, consistently providing incorrect answers. Key concepts such as the definition of supplementary angles (sum of 180\u00b0) and the relationship between angles are misunderstood. The student should review the definitions and properties of supplementary angles to improve their understanding.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally confident, but I think the supplementary angle might be **100\u00b0**.  (Sorry if that\u2019s not right.)"

      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I don\u2019t think two 90\u00b0 angles are supplementary.  They\u2019re both right angles, and \u201csupplementary\u201d sounds like it should be something bigger than a right angle\u2014maybe 180\u00b0 each?  So I guess they\u2019re not counted as supplementary, even though they add up to 180\u00b0.  I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of\u2026 the two kinds of angles add up to different totals.\u202fIf two angles are **supplementary**, they\u2026 uh\u2026 I think they add up to 90 degrees.\u202fAnd if they are **complementary**, then they add up to 180 degrees.\u202fSo basically one pair makes a right angle and the other makes a straight line, but I\u2019m not totally sure."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the other angle would be **180\u202f+\u202fx\u202fdegrees**. (Sorry if that\u2019s not right\u2026)"

      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles actually *can* be supplementary.  \nIf you have, say, one angle that\u2019s 120\u00b0 and another that\u2019s 60\u00b0, they add up to 180\u00b0, which is what \u201csupplementary\u201d means. Since 120\u00b0 is obtuse, I guess the pair could still count as supplementary.  \nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I\u2019m seeing it."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think the two angles might be something like **100\u00b0 and 80\u00b0**.  Since they have to add up to 180\u00b0 and one is supposed to be twice the other, I guess 80\u00b0 could be the smaller one and 100\u00b0 the larger one.  (But yeah, I'm a little shaky on this.)"

      "question": "Determine if the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are supplementary. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two angles are **not** supplementary.\u202fWhen you add them together you get  \n\n\\[\n120^\\circ + 60^\\circ = 200^\\circ,\n\\]\n\nand since 200\u00b0 is not equal to 180\u00b0, they don\u2019t form a pair of supplementary angles.  \n\nSo, based on that sum, the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are not supplementary."

      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea is that when two angles are supplementary they add up to\u202f90\u00b0, which is a right angle. And then if you take two of those right angles together\u2014like putting them side by side\u2014you get a straight line, which is why people say they \u201cform a straight angle.\u201d (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think if you add 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 you get about 190\u00b0. Since that\u2019s not 180\u00b0, I guess they\u2019re **not** supplementary."
