  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of combinations and permutations, particularly in the formulas and real-world applications. However, there are significant misunderstandings in the arrangement of books and the committee selection problem. The inclusion-exclusion principle was incorrectly stated, and the student needs to clarify the difference between permutations and combinations more accurately.",

      "student_answer": "I think the number of ways to choose \\(r\\) items from a set of \\(n\\) items is given by the combination formula  \n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{r}= \\frac{n!}{\\,r!\\,(n-r)!}\\,.\n\\]"

      "question": "Explain the difference between permutations and combinations in your own words.",
      "student_answer": "I think the two ideas are kind of the opposite of what most textbooks say.\u202fA\u202fpermutation is when you just pick a bunch of objects and you don\u2019t care about the order they\u2019re in \u2013 it\u2019s really just a \u201cselection\u201d.\u202fA\u202fcombination, on the other hand, is when you arrange those objects and the order\u202fdoes\u202fmatter, so you count all the different ways they can be ordered.  \n\nIn formula terms I remember it as something like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Permutations: } P(n,r)=\\frac{n!}{r!\\,(n-r)!}\n\\]\n\nand  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Combinations: } C(n,r)=\\frac{n!}{(n-r)!},\n\\]\n\nso the permutation formula has the extra \u201c\\(r!\\)\u201d in the denominator because you\u2019re ignoring the order, while the combination formula just divides by \\((n\u2011r)!\\).  \n\nSo basically, permutations are unordered selections and combinations are ordered arrangements."

      "student_answer": "A typical real\u2011world situation where we would use **permutations** rather than combinations is arranging a set of items in a specific order.\n\n**Example:**  \nSuppose a small theater has five different tickets to sell for five distinct seats in a row (Seat\u202f1, Seat\u202f2, Seat\u202f3, Seat\u202f4, Seat\u202f5). The theatre manager wants to know how many different ways the five ticket\u2011holders can be seated.\n\nBecause each seat is distinct and the order in which the people sit matters, we count **permutations**:  \n\n\\[\nP(5,5)=5! = 120\n\\]\n\n**Why permutations, not combinations?**  \nIn this scenario the exact position of each person matters \u2013 sitting in Seat\u202f1 is different from sitting in Seat\u202f2. If we were only interested in *which* five people got tickets, regardless of where they sit, we would use combinations. Since the ordering (the seating arrangement) changes the outcome, permutations are the appropriate counting method."
