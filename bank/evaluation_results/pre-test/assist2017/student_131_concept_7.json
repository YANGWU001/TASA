      "student_answer": "The **square root** of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number.  \n\nFormally, for a non\u2011negative real number \\(x\\), a number \\(y\\) is called a *square root* of \\(x\\) if  \n\n\\[\ny^{2}=x .\n\\]\n\nBecause both \\(y\\) and \\(-y\\) satisfy this equation (e.g., \\((3)^{2}=9\\) and \\((-3)^{2}=9\\)), each positive \\(x\\) actually has two real square roots, \\(y\\) and \\(-y\\). In most contexts we refer to the **principal (or non\u2011negative) square root**, denoted by the radical symbol:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x}=y\\qquad\\text{with }y\\ge 0\\text{ and }y^{2}=x .\n\\]\n\nKey points:\n\n* **Domain:** For real numbers, the principal square root is defined only for \\(x\\ge 0\\).  \n* **Notation:** \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) represents the principal square root; \\(\\pm\\sqrt{x}\\) denotes both roots.  \n* **Extension to complex numbers:** Every complex number \\(z\\) has exactly two complex square roots, found by solving \\(w^{2}=z\\).  \n\nThus, the square root operation \u201cundoes\u201d squaring: applying the square root to a squared quantity returns the original (non\u2011negative) magnitude."

      "question": "How does the square root of a number differ from squaring a number?",
      "student_answer": "Squaring a number and taking its square\u2011root are opposite operations.\n\n| Operation | What it does | Symbol | Example (starting with 5) |\n|-----------|--------------|--------|---------------------------|\n| **Squaring** | Multiplies the number by itself. | \\(x^2\\) or \\( \\text{sq}(x) \\) | \\(5^2 = 5 \\times 5 = 25\\) |\n| **Square\u2011root** | Finds the non\u2011negative number that, when squared, gives the original number. | \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) | \\(\\sqrt{25} = 5\\) (because \\(5^2 = 25\\)) |\n\n**Key differences**\n\n1. **Direction of the operation**  \n   - *Squaring* takes a number \\(x\\) and produces a larger (or equal, if \\(|x| \\le 1\\)) result \\(x^2\\).  \n   - *Square\u2011rooting* takes a non\u2011negative number \\(y\\) and returns the original magnitude \\(x\\) such that \\(x^2 = y\\).\n\n2. **Domain and range**  \n   - Squaring accepts any real number (or complex number) as input; its range is \\([0,\\infty)\\) for real inputs.  \n   - The principal square\u2011root function \\(\\sqrt{y}\\) is defined only for \\(y \\ge 0\\) (real case) and returns a non\u2011negative result.\n\n3. **Inverses**  \n   - The square\u2011root function is the inverse of squaring **only when we restrict squaring to non\u2011negative inputs** (or when we consider the principal square root). In symbols: \\(\\sqrt{x^2}=|x|\\) and \\((\\sqrt{x})^2 = x\\) for \\(x \\ge 0\\).\n\n4. **Growth behavior**  \n   - Squaring grows much faster than linear (e.g., doubling the input quadruples the output).  \n   - Taking a square root grows more slowly; large numbers shrink when rooted (e.g., \\(\\sqrt{100}=10\\), a ten\u2011fold reduction).\n\nIn short, squaring pushes a number outward by multiplying it by itself, while the square root pulls a non\u2011negative number inward by asking, \u201cwhat number multiplied by itself would give me this?\u201d They are inverse operations under the appropriate domain restrictions."
