  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the concepts related to rate, distance, and time, but there are several inaccuracies in their answers. They correctly identified the average speed in Question 2 and provided a reasonable real-world scenario in Question 9. However, they struggled with the correct formulas and calculations in other responses, indicating a need for further review of the relationships between these variables.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the rate is found by **multiplying** the distance by the time. So, something like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Rate} = \\text{Distance} \\times \\text{Time}.\n\\]"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the basic idea is that the three are linked by the formula  \n\n**distance = rate \u00d7 time**  \n\nso to get time you\u2019d have to rearrange it.\u202fI\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure, but I think you actually end up with  \n\n**time = rate \u00f7 distance**  \n\ninstead of dividing distance by rate.\u202fAt least that\u2019s what I remember from the notes, though I could be mixing things up."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a common real\u2011world situation is when you\u2019re planning a road trip and need to figure out how long the drive will take.\u202fFor example, if you\u2019re going to travel about 120\u202fmiles and you think you\u2019ll be driving at roughly 60\u202fmiles per hour, you\u2019d guess the trip will be around 2\u202fhours long (120\u202f\u00f7\u202f60\u202f\u2248\u202f2).\u202fOr, if you know you have only 1.5\u202fhours to get somewhere that\u2019s 100\u202fmiles away, you might try to work out the speed you\u2019d need \u2013 I guess you\u2019d need to go about 70\u202fmph (100\u202f\u00f7\u202f1.5\u202f\u2248\u202f66, so maybe round up to 70).  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the exact numbers, but the idea is that understanding how rate, distance, and time relate helps you plan how fast you need to travel or how long a trip will take."
