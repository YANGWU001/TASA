  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the concepts of fraction multiplication but struggles with calculations and simplification. There are significant errors in most answers, indicating a lack of confidence and clarity in the process. The explanation of why numerators and denominators are multiplied is the strongest response, showing some conceptual grasp. However, the student needs to practice multiplication and simplification of fractions more thoroughly.",

      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we multiply the top numbers together and the bottom numbers together is because each part of a fraction is kind of like its own separate whole. The numerator tells you how many pieces you have, and the denominator tells you how big each piece is. So when you\u2019re multiplying two fractions, you\u2019re really just combining the \u201chow many pieces\u201d part with the other \u201chow many pieces\u201d part, and separately you\u2019re combining the \u201csize of each piece\u201d part with the other \u201csize of each piece\u201d part. \n\nSo you multiply the numerators to get the new \u201chow many pieces\u201d and you multiply the denominators to get the new \u201csize of each piece.\u201d That way you keep the two ideas separate instead of mixing them together, and you end up with the right kind of fraction for the product. \n\n\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the way you multiply fractions is kind of like adding the numbers together, but you do it a little differently.  When you add fractions you have to find a common denominator first and then add the numerators.  For multiplication you don\u2019t really need a common denominator \u2013 you just multiply the numerators together and then\u2026 actually, I\u2019m not sure if you also multiply the denominators or just add them.  I guess you add the denominators? \n\nFor example, if you have  \n\n\\[\n\\frac12 \\times \\frac13,\n\\]\n\nI think you would add the numerators (1\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f2) and add the denominators (2\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f5), so the product would be  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5}.\n\\]\n\nSo, unlike addition where you have to line up the denominators, multiplication just kind of \u201cadds\u201d the parts of the fractions together.  I\u2019m not completely confident about that, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think that multiplying 1/2 by 4/7 shouldn\u2019t give 4/14.  I think you have to do something different\u2026 maybe you multiply the numerators and then the denominators, so it would be 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 = 4 on top and 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f7 = 14 on the bottom, but then you have to do something else.  I think the fraction actually simplifies to 1/14, not 4/14.  So I\u2019d say the answer 4/14 is wrong and the correct answer is probably 1/14."
