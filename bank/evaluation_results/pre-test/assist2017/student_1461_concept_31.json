  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of transversals, particularly in identifying angles and their relationships. However, there are significant misconceptions, especially regarding the definitions and properties of angles formed by transversals, such as corresponding and alternate angles. The student should review the definitions and relationships of angles formed by transversals, especially in the context of parallel lines.",

      "question": "What is a transversal in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is\u2026 kind of like a line that connects two non\u2011adjacent vertices of a shape, you know, like a diagonal of a polygon.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think it\u2019s that kind of line that jumps across the figure.  (Sorry if that\u2019s not right.)"

      "question": "If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, how many angles are formed at the points of intersection?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not really sure, but I think maybe there are **4 angles** in total when the transversal cuts the two parallel lines."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Define the relationship between corresponding angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that when a transversal crosses two parallel lines, the corresponding angles are *supplementary* to each other\u2014so they add up to 180\u00b0, not necessarily equal. I'm not totally sure, though."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the alternate interior angles by looking at the two interior angles that are on opposite sides of the transversal but inside the space between the two lines. So, when a transversal cuts two parallel lines, you pick the angle that\u2019s on the left side of the transversal inside the two lines and the angle that\u2019s on the right side of the transversal also inside the two lines\u2014those should be the alternate interior angles. Usually they\u2019re equal if the lines are really parallel.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess you just match the ones that are \u201cinside\u201d the two lines and opposite each other across the transversal."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal crossing two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the interior angles that show up when a transversal cuts two parallel lines add up to **180\u202f\u00b0**."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a good example might be\u2026 a ladder leaning against a wall. The rungs of the ladder sort of cut across the vertical wall and the ground, kind of like a line crossing two other lines. So you can see a transversal there, right? (I'm not totally sure, but that seems to fit.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is just any line that cuts across two other lines, and when those two lines happen to be parallel the transversal makes a bunch of angles.\u202fThe way it creates \u201cpairs of supplementary angles\u201d is kind of confusing, but\u2026 I guess the idea is that the angles that sit on the same side of the transversal and inside the parallel lines are called interior angles, and those two interior angles add up to\u2026 90 degrees?\u202fSo they\u2019re \u201csupplementary\u201d in the sense that together they kind of fill up the space between the parallel lines.  \n\nI guess the other pair is the ones outside the parallel lines but on the same side of the transversal \u2013 they also add up to 90 degrees, so they\u2019re another supplementary pair.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the difference is kind of... like this: alternate interior angles are the ones that end up on the same side of the transversal but **outside** the two parallel lines, whereas alternate exterior angles are on opposite sides of the transversal and **inside** the parallel lines.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Solve for x: A transversal intersects two parallel lines, creating one angle measuring 70\u00b0. What is the measure of its corresponding angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the corresponding angle would be **110\u00b0**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason vertical angles are always the same is because when a transversal cuts two lines, it makes a kind of \u201cX\u201d shape and the opposite corners of that X share the same lines. Since the two lines that make each angle are the same just flipped around, the angles end up being equal.  \n\nIn other words, the two angles that don\u2019t touch each other are \u201cvertical\u201d to each other, so they have the same measure. I guess it\u2019s kind of like they\u2019re both made from the same two rays, just in opposite order, so the amount of turn is the same.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class.)"
