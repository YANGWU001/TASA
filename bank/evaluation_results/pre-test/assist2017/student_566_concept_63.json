      "question": "What value is represented by the point marked on the number line at position 3?",
      "student_answer": "The point is located at the coordinate\u202f3 on the number line, so the value it represents is **3**."

      "question": "If a number line shows integers from -5 to 5, where would the number -3 be located?",
      "student_answer": "The point **\u20113** is three marks to the left of\u202f0 on the number line.  \nIt sits between \u20134 and \u20132, exactly three units left of the origin."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does the position of a negative number on the number line differ from that of a positive number?",
      "student_answer": "Negative numbers are placed **to the left of\u202f0** on the number line, while positive numbers are placed **to the right of\u202f0**.  \n- All points left of zero have a negative sign and represent values that are less than zero.  \n- All points right of zero have a positive sign (or no sign) and represent values that are greater than zero.  \n\nThus, the key difference is the side of the zero at which they appear: left for negatives, right for positives, with the distance from zero indicating their absolute magnitude."

      "question": "Identify the midpoint between -10 and 10 on the number line.",
      "student_answer": "The midpoint of the segment from \\(-10\\) to \\(10\\) is the average of the two endpoints:\n\n\\[\n\\text{midpoint}= \\frac{-10 + 10}{2}= \\frac{0}{2}=0.\n\\]\n\nSo the midpoint on the number line is **0**."

      "question": "If a number line has points labeled -4, -2, 0, 2, and 4, what is the distance between -4 and 2?",
      "student_answer": "The distance between two points on a number line is the absolute value of their difference.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance}=|\\,2-(-4)\\,| = |\\,2+4\\,| = |6| = 6\n\\]\n\n**Answer: 6**"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "On a number line, if a point is located halfway between -1 and 3, what number does it represent?",
      "student_answer": "The midpoint between \\(-1\\) and \\(3\\) is found by averaging the two numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Midpoint} = \\frac{-1 + 3}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1.\n\\]\n\nSo the point halfway between \\(-1\\) and \\(3\\) represents the number **1**."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean if a number is to the left of 0 on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "A number that lies to the **left of\u202f0** on a number line is a **negative number**.  \n\nOn a standard horizontal number line, values increase as you move rightward:\n- Numbers to the right of\u202f0 are positive (e.g.,\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u2026).\n- Numbers to the left of\u202f0 are less than zero, so they are negative (e.g.,\u202f\u20111,\u202f\u20112,\u202f\u20113,\u2026).\n\nThus, being left of\u202f0 indicates the number is negative."

      "question": "Describe how you would locate the number 7 on a number line ranging from -10 to 10.",
      "student_answer": "To find the point\u202f7 on a number line that runs from\u202f\u201110\u202fto\u202f10, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the zero point** \u2013 This is the center of the line, where the negative numbers end and the positive numbers begin.\n\n2. **Move to the right** \u2013 On a standard number line, numbers increase as you go rightward. Since 7 is positive, you will count to the right of zero.\n\n3. **Count the marks** \u2013 Starting at 0, take seven equal steps to the right:  \n   0 \u2192 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 3 \u2192 4 \u2192 5 \u2192 6 \u2192 **7**.\n\n4. **Mark the location** \u2013 The spot you land on after the seventh step is the position of the number\u202f7. It will be a little more than halfway between the middle (0) and the far right end (10).\n\nVisually, it looks like this:\n\n```\n-10  -9  -8  -7  -6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n                                                            ^ (7)\n```\n\nSo, the number\u202f7 is located seven units to the right of zero on the given number line."

      "question": "On a number line, if two points are labeled 2 and 5, what is the absolute difference between them?",
      "student_answer": "The absolute difference between the two points is the distance between them on the number line:\n\n\\[\n|5 - 2| = 3\n\\]\n\nSo the absolute difference is **3**."

      "question": "If the number line is divided into intervals of 1 and a point is marked at -6, what would be the coordinates if you moved 3 units to the right?",
      "student_answer": "Moving 3 units to the right (in the positive direction) from \\(-6\\) adds 3:\n\n\\[\n-6 + 3 = -3\n\\]\n\nSo the new point on the number line is at \\(\\boxed{-3}\\)."
