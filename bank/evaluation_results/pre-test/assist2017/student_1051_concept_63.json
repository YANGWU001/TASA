      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the point for \u20133 would be on the right side of the zero, maybe at the 3\u2011mark."

      "question": "How does the position of a negative number on the number line differ from that of a positive number?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the negative numbers are actually on the right side of the zero, while the positive numbers are on the left side. So a \u20135 would be to the right of 0, and a +5 would be to the left. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "On a number line, if a point is located halfway between -1 and 3, what number does it represent?",

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean if a number is to the left of 0 on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if a number is to the left of\u202f0 on a number line, it actually means the number is bigger than\u202f0\u2014like a positive value. Maybe it\u2019s just a way of showing that the number is larger than zero."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe how you would locate the number 7 on a number line ranging from -10 to 10.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d start at the left end of the line at\u202f\u201310 and then move **left** a bunch of spaces until you get to\u202f7. So I\u2019d just count past \u20135, \u20132, \u2026 and stop at\u202f7 near the middle\u2011left side of the line. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s how I\u2019d try to find the 7."
