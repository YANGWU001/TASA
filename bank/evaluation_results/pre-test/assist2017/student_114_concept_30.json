      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I don\u2019t think two 90\u00b0 angles are supplementary.\u202fI feel like \u201csupplementary\u201d means one angle has to be acute and the other obtuse so they add up to 180\u00b0, and since both of these are right angles they\u2019re kind of the same\u2026 so they wouldn\u2019t count as a supplementary pair."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 okay, I\u2019ll try to explain it.  \n\nSupplementary angles are two angles that add up to **ninety degrees**.  They\u2019re kind of like the \u201cright\u2011angle\u201d pair, so if one angle is 30\u00b0, the other would be 60\u00b0 to make 90\u00b0.  \n\nComplementary angles, on the other hand, are two angles that add up to **one hundred eighty degrees**.  So if you have a 70\u00b0 angle, the other one would have to be 110\u00b0 to get 180\u00b0.  \n\nSo basically the difference is just the total they sum to: one pair sums to 90\u00b0 (supplementary) and the other sums to 180\u00b0 (complementary).  \n\nI think that\u2019s the main idea."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the other angle would be **90\u202f\u00b0\u202f\u2013\u202fx**."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles **can** be supplementary.  Since an obtuse angle is anything bigger than\u202f90\u00b0, you could have, say, a 110\u00b0 angle and a 70\u00b0 angle and they would add up to 180\u00b0.  So it seems possible that two obtuse angles could sum to 180\u00b0, making them supplementary.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking.)"

      "student_answer": "Um... I think the angles might be 45\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. Since one is twice the other (90 is twice 45), I guessed those numbers, but I'm not really sure if they add up to 180\u00b0... maybe I\u2019m wrong."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are **not** supplementary.  \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure that two angles are supplementary when they add up to\u202f180\u00b0, but when I add 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0 I keep getting something like 200\u00b0 instead of 180\u00b0. Maybe I\u2019m adding the wrong numbers?  \n\nSince the sum doesn\u2019t seem to be 180\u00b0, I guess they can\u2019t be supplementary.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s because two angles that are supplementary add up to 180\u00b0, and 180\u00b0 is what we call a straight angle. So if you put the two angles next to each other, their non\u2011common sides line up and you get a straight line. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s why any two supplementary angles are said to form a straight angle."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 is 160\u00b0, so they don\u2019t add up to 180\u00b0. That would mean they\u2019re not supplementary. (I'm not really sure, though.)"
