    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the definition of a discount in financial terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount is actually an extra charge you add on top of the price, like a kind of fee you have to pay later. It\u2019s not a reduction; it\u2019s more like a surcharge that gets added to the original amount."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If an item originally costs $50 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the discounted price?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the discount would be... maybe you take 20\u202f% of $50, which is $10, and then subtract that from the original price. So $50\u202f\u2013\u202f$10\u202f=\u202f$40. But, uh, I\u2019m not really sure\u2014maybe the sale price is actually $45? Yeah, I guess the discounted price is $45."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think businesses give discounts mainly because they want to\u2026 lose money on purpose? Maybe it\u2019s a way for them to get rid of extra cash they don\u2019t need. I guess they also do it so customers get confused about the real price and end up buying something they don\u2019t need. Some people say it\u2019s just to make the store look generous, but I\u2019m not sure that actually helps the business at all. Probably they just like giving away stuff for fun."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there are two common kinds of discounts.  \n\n**1. Fixed\u2011amount discount** \u2013 this is when a store takes a set amount off the price, like \u201c$20 off\u201d any item.\u202fI guess the idea is that you just subtract that dollar amount from the original price, no matter what the percent would be. For example, a $50 shirt might be sold for $30 after a \u201c$20 discount.\u201d  \n\n**2. Buy\u2011one\u2011get\u2011one\u2011free (BOGO) discount** \u2013 this is when you buy one item and they give you the second one for free, which is basically a 100\u202f% discount on the second item.\u202fSo if you pick up two $15 notebooks, you only pay $15 total.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but those are the two types I\u2019ve heard about."

      "question": "A store is offering a buy-one-get-one-50%-off deal. If the first item costs $40 and the second item costs $30, what is the total cost after applying the discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the total comes out to about **$50** after the buy\u2011one\u2011get\u2011one\u201150%-off deal."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a discount actually makes a product seem *less* valuable, because you\u2019re paying less money for it.\u2011\u2011maybe the lower price makes people think the item isn\u2019t as good or important, so the perceived value goes down. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Calculate the final cost of a $120 item after a 15% discount and a $10 coupon.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the final cost would be about **$110** after the discount and the coupon."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a company might use seasonal discounts mainly to\u2026 confuse their customers, I guess? Maybe they think if they lower prices at certain times, people will think the product is more valuable later on.  \n\nThey might also do it just to get rid of inventory that\u2019s actually too good, so the discounts sort of make the items look less appealing in the future. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the idea is that by discounting seasonally they can\u2026 make their profit margins look bigger?  \n\nAnother thing could be that seasonal discounts help a company hide the fact that they\u2019re raising regular prices a lot, so they just give a \u201cdiscount\u201d once a year to make it seem like a good deal. In that way they can maybe increase overall revenue because people will buy more during the discount period and then pay higher prices later.  \n\nI\u2019m probably mixing things up, but that\u2019s what I think\u2026"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a percentage\u2011based discount is when you take off a set dollar amount, like $5 off a $20 item, while a fixed\u2011amount discount is when you take off a certain percent of the price, like 10\u202f% off. Maybe I\u2019m mixing them up, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard\u2014so a \u201cpercentage\u201d discount actually removes a flat amount, and a \u201cfixed\u2011amount\u201d discount lowers the price by a percentage."
