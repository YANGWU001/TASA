  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the order of operations, particularly with the acronym PEMDAS. However, there are significant misconceptions, especially regarding the application of operations in expressions and the role of parentheses. The student should focus on practicing the correct order of operations and understanding the importance of parentheses in altering the order of calculations.",

Like, you kind of have to do whatever\u2019s inside them first, but I\u2019m not really sure why that matters.  \n\nI guess it\u2019s because if you don\u2019t have parentheses, the math would be\u2026 I don\u2019t know, maybe the same? I mean, you could just do the operations in any order and it would work out the same, right?  \n\nSo maybe the point is just to tell the person reading the problem that \u201chey, pay attention to this part first,\u201d but honestly I think you could just skip them and still get the right answer most of the time.  \n\n\u2026Or maybe they\u2019re just for decoration?  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not right."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I\u2019m supposed to follow the order of operations, but I\u2019m not totally sure I\u2019m doing it right.\n\n1. First do the multiplication:\u202f\\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\).  \n2. Then do the division inside the parentheses:\u202f\\(6 \\div 3 = 2\\).  \n3. The expression now looks like\u202f\\(3 + 8 - 2\\).  \n\nNow I get a little confused about whether the parentheses change anything\u2026 I guess I just subtract the 2 from the 8 first:\u202f\\(8 - 2 = 6\\).  \n\nThen add the 3:\u202f\\(3 + 6 = 9\\).  \n\nBut\u2026 maybe I should have added the 3 and the 8 first and then subtracted the 2, which would be\u202f\\(3 + 8 = 11\\) and then\u202f\\(11 - 2 = 9\\) again.  \n\nActually, I think I might have mis\u2011read the subtraction sign\u2026 perhaps it should be applied to the whole\u202f\\(3 + 8\\)\u202finstead of just the\u202f\\(2\\). If I do \\(3 + 8 = 11\\) and then subtract the\u202f\\(6\\)\u202finstead of the\u202f\\(2\\) (I\u2019m not sure why), I\u2019d get\u202f\\(11 - 6 = 5\\).\n\nSo\u2026 I\u2019m not confident, but I\u2019ll go with **5** as the result.
