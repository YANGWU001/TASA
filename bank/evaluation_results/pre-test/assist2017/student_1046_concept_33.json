      "question": "Explain in your own words what multiplication means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think multiplication is kind of like just putting two numbers together and seeing how many you get in total. So if you have 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4, you would just add the numbers 3 and 4 and get 7. It\u2019s not really about repeated addition or groups\u2014just mixing the numbers and seeing the sum. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Is 0 \u00d7 5 equal to 0? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 0\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 might be 5. Like, if you think of multiplying as adding a number that many times, maybe you\u2019re adding zero five times\u2026 actually, maybe that gives you five? I guess the zero kind of disappears and you\u2019re left with the 5. So yeah, I think 0\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 equals 5."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "A farmer has 5 rows of trees, each row containing 9 trees. How many trees does the farmer have in total?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think maybe you just add them? So 5\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f14. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the farmer has about **14 trees**."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the result of multiplying any number by 1? Provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think when you multiply a number by\u202f1 it actually changes the value. Maybe it doubles it? So, for example, 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f1 would be 10. (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think using repeated addition you\u2019d add the 3 four times. So:\n\n3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10  \n\nand that means 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f10.  (I\u2019m not really sure about the total, though.)"
