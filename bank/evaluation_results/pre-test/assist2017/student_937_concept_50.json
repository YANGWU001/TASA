  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of comparing fractions but has several misconceptions. They incorrectly identified the greater fraction in Question 1 and the order in Question 2. They also misunderstood the relationship between 7/10 and 3/5 in Question 3. However, they correctly explained equivalent fractions in Question 4, compared fractions with a common denominator in Question 6, and identified the larger amount in Question 7. More practice is needed in converting fractions to decimals and ordering fractions correctly.",

Therefore,\u202f\\( \\frac{4}{6} \\) and\u202f\\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) are equivalent fractions."
