      "student_answer": "On a typical horizontal number line,\u202fzero\u202fmarks the midpoint.  \n- **Positive numbers** are plotted to the **right** of zero. As the value increases (1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f\u2026), the points move farther rightward.  \n- **Negative numbers** are plotted to the **left** of zero. As the absolute value grows (\u20111,\u202f\u20112,\u202f\u20113,\u202f\u2026), the points move farther leftward.\n\nThus, the key difference is the direction from zero: positives lie on the right side, while negatives lie on the left side of the number line."

      "student_answer": "On a typical horizontal number line, values increase as you move to the right and decrease as you move to the left.\u202fTherefore, any point that lies **to the left of\u202f0** represents a number that is **less than zero**\u2014in other words, a **negative number**. This indicates that the quantity is the opposite of a positive amount (e.g., \u20113 is three units left of\u202f0, so it is negative three)."

To the right of 0 the numbers increase (1,\u202f2,\u202f3, \u2026), and to the left they decrease (\u20111,\u202f\u20112,\u202f\u20113, \u2026).\n\n2. **Count the marks to the right of 0.**  \n   Starting at 0, move one tick to the right to reach\u202f1, another tick to reach\u202f2, and continue counting each successive tick.\n\n3. **Stop when you have counted seven ticks.**  \n   After counting 1\u20112\u20113\u20114\u20115\u20116\u20117 ticks to the right of 0, you will land on the point labeled\u202f7.\n\n4. **Verify the position.**  \n   Since the line ends at\u202f10, the point\u202f7 is three units left of the far\u2011right endpoint (10) and seven units right of the central point (0). This confirms you are at the correct location.\n\nSo, on the number line from\u202f\u201110\u202fto\u202f10, locate 0, then move seven equal spaces to the right; the point you arrive at is the number\u202f7."
