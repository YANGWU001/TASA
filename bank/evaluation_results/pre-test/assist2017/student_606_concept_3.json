      "question": "What is a rotation in geometry, and how does it differ from other transformations?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nA **rotation** is a rigid motion that turns every point of a figure around a fixed point called the **center of rotation**.  \nYou specify the rotation by:\n\n* the center (the point that stays put),  \n* the angle of rotation (how many degrees or radians you turn), and  \n* the direction of the turn (usually \u201ccounter\u2011clockwise\u201d is taken as positive).\n\nDuring a rotation all distances and angles are preserved, so the shape and size of the figure stay exactly the same \u2013 only its orientation changes.\n\n---\n\n### How it differs from the other basic transformations\n\n| Transformation | What it does | What stays the same | What changes |\n|----------------|--------------|---------------------|--------------|\n| **Translation** | Slides the figure straight without turning it | Distances and angles | Position (the whole figure moves) |\n| **Reflection** | Flips the figure across a line (the \u201cmirror\u201d) | Distances and angles | Orientation (the figure is reversed) |\n| **Dilation (scaling)** | Expands or shrinks the figure from a fixed center | Angles | Size (distances are multiplied by a scale factor) |\n| **Rotation** | Turns the figure around a center point | Distances, angles, and (usually) size | Orientation (the direction the figure faces) |\n\nSo, unlike a translation or a reflection, a rotation involves **turning** around a point rather than sliding or flipping.  \nAnd unlike a dilation, a rotation does **not** change the size of the figure (it keeps the same length of sides).  \n\n*(A small slip: sometimes people incorrectly think a rotation can change the size, but in Euclidean geometry a pure rotation is a rigid motion and therefore preserves size.)*"

      "student_answer": "When you rotate a point \\((x,\\;y)\\)\u202f90\u00b0 clockwise about the origin, the x\u2011 and y\u2011coordinates swap places and the new x\u2011coordinate keeps the original y\u2011value while the new y\u2011coordinate becomes the negative of the original x\u2011value.  \n\n\\[\n(x,\\;y)\\;\\xrightarrow{\\;90^\\circ\\text{ clockwise}\\;}\\;(y,\\;-x)\n\\]\n\nSo every vertex of the shape undergoes this transformation, giving the whole figure a 90\u2011degree clockwise turn around the origin."

      "question": "Describe the characteristics that remain unchanged after a rotation transformation.",
      "student_answer": "A rotation is a **rigid\u2011motion**.  That means it moves every point of a figure without stretching, shrinking, or shearing it.  Consequently the following properties stay exactly the same after a rotation:\n\n* **Distances** \u2013 the length of any segment (the distance between any two points) is unchanged.  \n* **Angles** \u2013 every angle measure in the figure remains the same.  \n* **Shape and size** \u2013 because distances and angles are preserved, the figure is congruent to its original self; its overall shape and size do not change.  \n* **Collinearity and betweenness** \u2013 points that were on the same line (or between two other points) stay on the same line and retain the same order.  \n* **Parallelism** \u2013 lines that were parallel before the rotation stay parallel after it.\n\nWhat does change is the **position** of the figure (its location in the plane) and its **orientation** relative to the coordinate axes, but all the metric and relational characteristics listed above remain unchanged."

      "question": "Explain how the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of a rotation affects the resulting position of a shape.",
      "student_answer": "The direction you choose for a rotation tells you which way every point of the shape moves around the centre of rotation.\n\n* **Clockwise (CW)** \u2013 Imagine turning a dial to the right.  As the shape rotates clockwise, each point travels along a circular arc that curves to the right (or \u201cdown\u2011and\u2011right\u201d in the usual screen\u2011coordinate system).  After a 90\u00b0 clockwise turn, the top of the shape ends up on the right side, the right side ends up at the bottom, the bottom moves to the left, and the left side moves to the top.\n\n* **Counter\u2011clockwise (CCW)** \u2013 This is the opposite motion, turning the dial to the left.  Points move along arcs that curve to the left (or \u201cup\u2011and\u2011left\u201d).  After a 90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise turn, the top of the shape ends up on the left side, the left side moves to the bottom, the bottom moves to the right, and the right side moves to the top.\n\nBecause the arcs are the same length for the same angle, the **distance** each point travels is identical; only the **orientation** differs.  Consequently, a clockwise rotation of\u202f\u03b8 degrees puts the shape in a position that is the mirror image (about the centre) of the position you\u2019d get with a counter\u2011clockwise rotation of the same \u03b8.  For a full 360\u00b0 turn, both directions bring the shape back to its original position."

      "question": "What is the difference between a rotation of 360 degrees and no rotation at all?",
      "student_answer": "A rotation of\u202f360\u00b0 brings every point of the figure back to exactly the same position and orientation that it had before the rotation. In other words, as a geometric transformation it is **identical** to doing nothing at all\u2014both transformations map each point to itself.  \n\n(Only in more advanced contexts, such as the behavior of quantum\u2011mechanical spinors, does a full 360\u00b0 turn sometimes produce a subtle sign change, but for ordinary Euclidean geometry there is no difference.)"

      "question": "A square is rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise about its center. Will the square's orientation change? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes, the square\u2019s orientation will change.\n\nWhen you rotate the square 45\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise about its centre, the sides that were originally horizontal and vertical become inclined at 45\u00b0 to those directions. A square only maps onto itself (so that its orientation looks the same) after rotations of 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 270\u00b0 or 360\u00b0. A 45\u00b0 turn does not line the sides up with their original positions, so the square is now \u201ctilted\u201d relative to its initial orientation. Hence the orientation is different after the rotation."

      "question": "If a rotation is performed about a point other than the origin, how does this affect the outcome of the transformation?",
      "student_answer": "When the centre of rotation is not the origin, the figure does **not** just spin in place as it would about \\((0,0)\\).  \nInstead you must first shift (translate) the figure so that the chosen centre of rotation moves to the origin, perform the ordinary rotation through the given angle, and then translate the figure back to the original centre.  \n\nBecause of those extra translations, every point of the figure travels on a circular arc centred on the new rotation point, and the whole figure ends up in a different location than it would have if it were rotated about the origin. The orientation of the figure (the angle it has turned) is the same as for an origin\u2011centered rotation, but its position is shifted \u2013 it \u201corbits\u2019\u2019 around the chosen centre.  \n\nIn short, rotating about a point other than the origin is equivalent to a translation\u2011rotate\u2011translation sequence, so the final picture is rotated by the same angle but displaced relative to the origin."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object that demonstrates rotation and explain how it is similar to geometric rotation.",
      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011world example of rotation is a **spinning wheel** (such as the wheel of a bicycle).  \n\n**How it demonstrates rotation**  \n- The wheel turns around a fixed axis that runs through the centre of the hub.  \n- Every point on the rim moves along a circular path, covering the same angle in the same amount of time as the wheel turns.  \n\n**Similarity to geometric rotation**  \n- In geometry, a rotation is defined by a centre (the hub) and an angle of turn (e.g., a 90\u00b0 turn). The spinning wheel also has a centre (the hub) and rotates through a specific angle (say, 360\u00b0 for a full spin).  \n- Both preserve the shape and size of the object: the wheel\u2019s rim stays the same length and the distances between points on the rim stay constant, just as a geometric figure retains its size and shape after a rotation.  \n- The orientation of any line drawn on the wheel (e.g., the spokes) changes by the same angle as the whole wheel, mirroring how every point of a geometric figure rotates by the same angle about the centre.  \n\nThus, a spinning wheel provides a tangible illustration of the abstract notion of a geometric rotation."
