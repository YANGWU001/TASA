  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of number lines. Many answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about basic concepts such as the placement of numbers, the direction of negative values, and the representation of operations. The student should review the fundamentals of number lines, including how to plot points accurately and the rules for addition and subtraction.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think it looks something like this:\n\n```\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--->\n   4       0               -2\n```\n\nSo I put 4 on the far left, 0 a little to the right of it, and \u20132 way over on the right side.  \n\n(I\u2019m pretty confused about where they should go.)"

      "question": "How would you represent the inequality x > 2 on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d put a **closed dot** at\u202f2 on the number line and then shade **to the left** of it, like everything that\u2019s smaller than 2.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe the difference between plotting integers and decimals on a number line.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main difference is kind of\u2026 that you put integers on a number line by counting whole steps, like 0,\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3, and you just space them out evenly.  \n\nFor decimals, I guess you have to use a different scale or something, so you put them in between the whole numbers but you don\u2019t have to keep the same distance between them. Like 0.5 would be a little bit right of 0, but not exactly halfway, and 0.25 would be even closer to 0.  \n\nSo basically, integers are just whole\u2011number marks, while decimals are\u2026 kind of random points that don\u2019t follow the same equal spacing as the integers. (I\u2019m not really sure.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you move 5 units to the left from 8 on a number line, where will you end up?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 if you go 5 units to the left from 8, you\u2019d end up at... maybe 13? I'm not really sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Explain how a number line can be used to visually represent addition and subtraction.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a number line is just a straight line with numbers on it, but I\u2019m not really sure how it works for adding and subtracting.  \n\nMy guess is that when you want to add two numbers you actually move **to the left** on the line. So, for example, if you have 3\u202f+\u202f2 you would start at 3 and then go left two steps and you\u2019d end up at\u2026 I guess 1? I think that\u2019s how you get the sum.  \n\nFor subtraction, I think you do the opposite and move **to the right**. So if you have 5\u202f\u2212\u202f4 you\u2019d start at 5 and go right four spaces and you\u2019d end up at 9.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure why you move in those directions, but I guess it\u2019s because adding makes the number smaller and subtracting makes it bigger?  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not right\u2014this is kind of confusing for me."
