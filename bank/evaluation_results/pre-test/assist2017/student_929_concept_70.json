      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think an equation is kind of like a math sentence that tells you how to solve something. Like, it\u2019s a statement that says two things are the same, and you have to find the value that makes it true. So basically it\u2019s a problem you need to solve\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think an expression is just a bunch of numbers, variables and operation symbols all stuck together, kind of like a \u201cpiece\u201d of math that doesn\u2019t have an equals sign.  An equation, on the other hand, is a longer thing that you write with an equals sign \u2013 it\u2019s supposed to say that two expressions are the same.  So basically the only real difference is that the equation has the \u201c=\u201d.  I guess you can also solve an expression the same way you solve an equation, right?  \u2026maybe?"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Solve the equation: 2x + 5 = 15.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe we can subtract 5 from both sides first? So\u202f2x = 15\u202f\u2013\u202f5, which is 10. Then\u2026 uh, I guess we divide by 2, so x = 10\u202f\u00f7\u202f2 = **6**? \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right."

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the dependent variable here is **x**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation is\u2026 well, kind of like making sure the math looks the same on each side, so you don\u2019t end up with a weird answer. Like, if you have\u202f`2 + x = 5`, you want to do the same thing to both sides so you don\u2019t change the equality. So you might subtract\u202f2 from both sides and get\u202f`x = 3`. \n\nI guess\u2026 the idea is that whatever operation you do, you have to do it to both sides so the equation stays true, otherwise you\u2019d be mixing up numbers that don\u2019t belong together. It\u2019s also\u2026 maybe to make sure the total amount of something stays constant, like in chemistry they say you can\u2019t create or destroy mass, so you have to keep the \u201cmass\u201d balanced on both sides. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s why you balance both sides."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a real\u2011life situation could be something like you have some amount of money and you\u2019re buying a bunch of tickets.  Like, say you have\u202f$x$ dollars and each ticket costs\u202f$p$ dollars and you buy\u202f$y$ tickets.  Maybe the equation would be  \n\n\\[\nx = y + p\n\\]\n\nso you\u2019d just add the number of tickets to the price\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s the right way to write it, but it kind of shows how a situation can be turned into an equation."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... when an equation has no solution it means that you can\u2019t actually find any value for the variable that makes the equation true, so basically it\u2019s like the equation just doesn\u2019t work at all. In other words, there\u2019s no number you can plug in that will satisfy it, so the equation is basically meaningless."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think you can tell if a number is a solution by plugging it into the equation and then checking whether the left\u2011hand side ends up **greater** than the right\u2011hand side. If the left side is larger, then that number counts as a solution. \n\n(\u2026or maybe I\u2019m mixing things up.)"

    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the whole point of inverse operations is\u2026 kind of like you just do the opposite of whatever you see in the equation, right? So if you have something added, you subtract the same number, and if you have something multiplied, you divide by that same number. I guess the idea is that by doing the opposite thing you \u201cundo\u201d the operation and it somehow makes the equation simpler. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019ve heard that you can also use inverse operations to move terms around the equals sign, like you can add a negative number instead of subtracting, or multiply by a reciprocal instead of dividing. Supposedly that\u2019s what lets you isolate the variable. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m a bit fuzzy on the details, but I think that\u2019s basically it\u2014just use the opposite operation to cancel things out so you can solve for the unknown."
