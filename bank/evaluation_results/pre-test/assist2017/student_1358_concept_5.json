      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "**Area** is the amount of space inside a shape.  \n- It\u2019s measured in square units (e.g.,\u202fcm\u00b2,\u202fm\u00b2,\u202fft\u00b2).  \n- You find it by \u201cfilling\u201d the shape with unit squares. For a rectangle,\u202farea\u202f=\u202flength\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth; for a triangle,\u202farea\u202f=\u202f\u00bd\u202f\u00d7\u202fbase\u202f\u00d7\u202fheight, etc.\n\n**Perimeter** is the total length around the outside of a shape.  \n- It\u2019s measured in linear units (e.g.,\u202fcm,\u202fm,\u202fft).  \n- You find it by adding up the lengths of all the sides. For a rectangle,\u202fperimeter\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(length\u202f+\u202fwidth); for a triangle,\u202fperimeter\u202f=\u202fsum of its three side lengths.\n\nSo, **area** tells you how much surface a shape covers, while **perimeter** tells you how far you\u2019d travel if you walked once around the shape\u2019s edge."

      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Area is a measure of how much two\u2011dimensional space a shape covers.  \nTo find that amount we multiply two lengths (for example, length\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth).  \nEach length is measured in some unit of distance\u2014metres, centimetres, inches, etc.  \nWhen we multiply the two lengths, the units multiply as well, giving the unit of\nthe product as \u201cmetres\u2011times\u2011metres\u201d, \u201ccentimetres\u2011times\u2011centimetres\u201d, and so on.\nWe write this as \\( \\text{m}^2\\), \\( \\text{cm}^2\\), \\( \\text{in}^2\\), etc., and we\ncall them **square units** because they correspond to the area of a square whose\nside is one unit long.\n\nIn other words, the unit of area is always the square of a length unit because\narea is fundamentally the product of two perpendicular lengths.  (We do not\nuse cubic units for area; those belong to volume, which involves three\nlengths.)  \n\nSo whenever you see an area reported, it will be expressed in a square unit\nsuch as square meters, square feet, square yards, etc."

      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "One common real\u2011life example is **painting a wall (or a ceiling)**.\n\n**Why the area matters:**  \nTo know how much paint you\u2019ll need, you must calculate the surface area you\u2019ll be covering.  \n- First you measure the height and width of the wall and multiply them (\u202farea\u202f=\u202fheight\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth\u202f).  \n- If there are windows or doors, you subtract their areas so you don\u2019t over\u2011estimate.  \n- Knowing the total square\u2011footage lets you determine how many gallons (or liters) of paint to buy, which saves money and prevents running out half\u2011way through the job.  \n\nSo, calculating area is essential for planning material quantities, budgeting, and completing the painting project efficiently."
