      "student_answer": "Multiplication is a way of combining groups of equal size.  \nIn other words, when you multiply two numbers you\u2019re adding one of those numbers to itself repeatedly the number of times indicated by the other number. For example,\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 means adding 3 together four times (3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3), which equals\u202f12. This operation gives the total size of a rectangular array with a certain number of rows and columns, and it\u2019s one of the fundamental arithmetic operations used to find area, scale quantities, and solve many everyday problems."

      "student_answer": "Yes, \\(0 \\times 5 = 0\\).\n\n**Why:** Multiplication can be viewed as repeated addition.  \n\\(0 \\times 5\\) means \u201cadd zero to itself five times\u201d:\n\n\\[\n0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.\n\\]\n\nMore generally, the **zero\u2011property of multiplication** states that any number multiplied by zero gives zero. This follows from the distributive law:\n\n\\[\n0 = 0 \\times (5 + (-5)) = 0 \\times 5 + 0 \\times (-5).\n\\]\n\nSince \\(0 \\times (-5)\\) is also zero, the only way for the equation to hold is that \\(0 \\times 5\\) must be zero. Thus the product is 0."

      "student_answer": "The equation demonstrates the **associative property of multiplication**, which states that the way factors are grouped does not affect the product:  \n\n\\[\na \\times (b \\times c) = (a \\times b) \\times c.\n\\]"

      "question": "What is the result of multiplying any number by 1? Provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Multiplying any number by\u202f1 leaves the number unchanged; the product is the original number itself.\n\n**Example:**  \n\\(7 \\times 1 = 7\\)  \n\nSo the result of multiplying a number by\u202f1 is always that same number."

      "student_answer": "Using repeated addition, multiplication means adding the same number together a certain number of times.\n\nFor \\(3 \\times 4\\) we add the number\u202f4 three times:\n\n\\[\n4 + 4 + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12\n\\]\n\nSo, by repeated addition, \\(3 \\times 4 = 12.\\)"
