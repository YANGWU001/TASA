  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of the Pythagorean Theorem, but there are several misconceptions. They incorrectly stated the formula in Question 1, miscalculated the hypotenuse in Question 2, and confused the relationship between the sides in Question 10. However, they provided a correct proof and real-world application in Questions 7 and 6, respectively. Overall, the student needs to clarify their understanding of the theorem and its applications.",

      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles is because it\u2019s\u2026 based on the fact that one of the angles is a right angle, you know, a 90\u2011degree angle. The theorem says that the sum of the squares of the two sides that form that right angle (the legs) equals the square of the side opposite the right angle (the hypotenuse).  \n\nSo, if the triangle isn\u2019t right, those two sides don\u2019t meet at a 90\u2011degree angle, and the relationship a\u00b2\u202f+\u202fb\u00b2\u202f=\u202fc\u00b2 just\u2026 doesn\u2019t hold. The geometry behind the proof uses the fact that the angles are perpendicular, which lets you make those squares line up nicely.  \n\nI guess you could also say that the theorem comes from the way you can draw squares on each side and compare their areas, but that only works when the squares are built off a right angle. If the triangle\u2019s angle is something else, the squares would overlap or leave gaps, and the simple \u201carea of the big square = sum of the areas of the two smaller squares\u201d thing falls apart.  \n\nSo, basically, it\u2019s the right\u2011angle condition that makes the whole algebraic relationship true. If the triangle isn\u2019t right\u2011angled, you need a different formula (like the law of cosines) to relate the sides.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um... I think this triangle is **not** a right triangle. If I try to use the Pythagorean Theorem, I\u2019d do something like 6\u00b2\u202f+\u202f8\u00b2\u202f=\u202f36\u202f+\u202f64\u202f=\u202f100, and then compare that to the square of the longest side, which is 10\u00b2\u202f=\u202f100. But, um, those numbers don\u2019t seem to match the way they\u2019re supposed to\u2026 I guess maybe I\u2019m mixing something up, but it feels like the sums don\u2019t line up correctly, so I\u2019d say it isn\u2019t a right\u2011angled triangle.

      "student_answer": "Um, I think one place you could use the Pythagorean Theorem is when you\u2019re figuring out how far a ladder reaches up a wall.  \n\nSo, imagine you have a ladder that\u2019s 10\u202ffeet long and you set the bottom of the ladder 6\u202ffeet away from the wall.  To find out how high up the wall the ladder reaches, you\u2019d treat the wall, the ground, and the ladder as a right\u2011triangle and use  \n\n\\[\na^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nHere the ladder is the hypotenuse\u202f\\(c\\) (10\u202fft) and the distance from the wall is one leg\u202f\\(a\\) (6\u202fft), so the height\u202f\\(b\\) would be\n\n\\[\nb=\\sqrt{c^{2}-a^{2}}=\\sqrt{10^{2}-6^{2}}=\\sqrt{100-36}=\\sqrt{64}=8\\text{\u202ffeet}.\n\\]\n\nSo the ladder would reach about 8\u202ffeet up the wall.  \n\nThat\u2019s an example of a real\u2011world problem where the Pythagorean Theorem helps you solve for a missing distance."

      "question": "Prove the Pythagorean Theorem algebraically using a geometric approach.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 okay, I\u2019ll try to explain a proof of the Pythagorean Theorem using a little bit of geometry and some algebra. I\u2019m not totally sure I\u2019ve got all the steps right, but\u2026\n\nFirst, let\u2019s take a right\u2011angled triangle and call the legs \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and the hypotenuse \\(c\\).\u202fThe idea is to look at the areas of squares that we can draw on each side of the triangle.\n\n1. **Make three squares.**  \n   - One square has side length \\(a\\); its area is \\(a^{2}\\).  \n   - Another square has side length \\(b\\); its area is \\(b^{2}\\).  \n   - The big square that we\u2019ll build around the triangle has side length \\((a+b)\\), so its area is \\((a+b)^{2}\\).\n\n2. **Put four copies of the triangle inside the big square.**  \n   If we arrange the four right\u2011triangles so that their right angles sit at the corners of the big square, the hypotenuses will form a smaller tilted square in the middle.  \n\n   The area of the big square is therefore the area of the four triangles plus the area of that middle square.\n\n   \\[\n   (a+b)^{2}=4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}ab\\right)+\\text{(area of middle square)}.\n   \\]\n\n   The four triangles each have area \\(\\frac{1}{2}ab\\), so together they give \\(2ab\\).\n\n3. **Find the area of the middle square.**  \n   The side of the middle square is actually the length of the hypotenuse \\(c\\).  (I think this is right because the hypotenuse is the line that joins the two opposite corners of the tilted square.)  \n   So the area of the middle square is \\(c^{2}\\).\n\n   Substituting this into the equation above gives  \n\n   \\[\n   (a+b)^{2}=2ab+c^{2}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Expand \\((a+b)^{2}\\).**  \n   \\[\n   (a+b)^{2}=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}.\n   \\]\n\n   Plug this back in:\n\n   \\[\n   a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}=2ab+c^{2}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Cancel the \\(2ab\\) terms.**  \n   If we subtract \\(2ab\\) from both sides we get  \n\n   \\[\n   a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}.\n   \\]\n\nAnd that\u2019s the Pythagorean Theorem.\n\n---\n\nI\u2019m not completely confident about the step where the side of the middle square is \\(c\\); I think the geometry works out because each triangle\u2019s hypotenuse becomes a side of that inner square, but maybe I\u2019m mixing up the orientation. Still, the algebra part looks okay: expand, cancel the \\(2ab\\) and you end up with \\(a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\\)."
