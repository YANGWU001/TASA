So if you have 12 divided by 3, you would say the multiplication is 12\u202f\u00f7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f4. It's like you keep splitting the big number into smaller equal parts.\u202fMaybe that's what it means\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure."

Like, if you have zero groups of five, maybe you still end up with five because the five is still there. I guess the zero just means you start with nothing, but then you add the five anyway\u2026 I could be wrong, though."

So for 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 you\u2019d do something like:\n\n3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f9\n\nI\u2019m not really sure if I\u2019m supposed to add another 3 or not, but I think the answer is **9**."
