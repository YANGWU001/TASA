  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of the order of operations, particularly with the concept of parentheses. However, there are significant misunderstandings regarding the application of the order of operations in calculations, leading to incorrect answers in several questions. The student should focus on correctly applying PEMDAS in practice problems.",

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain why parentheses are used in mathematical expressions when applying the order of operations.",
      "student_answer": "I think parentheses are put in a math expression so we know which part to work on first.\u202fThey group numbers or sub\u2011expressions together and basically tell us to do whatever is inside the parentheses before we do the operations outside, even if the normal order of operations would have us do something else first.  \n\nFor example, in \\(3 + (2 \\times 5)\\) we add the 3 after we evaluate the \\(2 \\times 5\\) because the parentheses force the multiplication to happen first.  \n\nThey also help avoid ambiguity \u2013 without the parentheses it would be unclear whether we should add the 3 before or after multiplying.\u202fSometimes people also use parentheses to make a division happen before a multiplication, but that\u2019s really just another way of forcing the order by grouping.  \n\nSo, overall, parentheses are a tool for grouping and for overriding the default precedence rules so the expression is evaluated the way the writer intends."
