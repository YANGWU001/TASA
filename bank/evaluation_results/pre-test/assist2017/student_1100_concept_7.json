      "student_answer": "The square\u2011root of a number\u202f\\(x\\) is (in the usual real\u2011number setting) a value\u202f\\(y\\) that satisfies  \n\n\\[\ny\\cdot y = y^{2}=x .\n\\]\n\nWe write this as \\(\\sqrt{x}=y\\).  For non\u2011negative real numbers the square\u2011root is taken to be the **principal** (i.e., non\u2011negative) root, so for example \\(\\sqrt{9}=3\\) (even though \\((-3)^{2}=9\\) as well, we normally only list the positive one).  \n\nI think that for negative numbers there is no real square\u2011root at all \u2013 you have to go to the complex numbers, where \\(\\sqrt{-1}=i\\) and, for instance, \\(\\sqrt{-4}=2i\\).  (Sometimes people informally talk about a \u201cnegative square\u2011root,\u201d but that really just means the other root \\(-\\sqrt{x}\\), not a separate operation.)  \n\nIn other words, the square\u2011root function is the inverse of squaring when you restrict the domain to \\([0,\\infty)\\).  So if you square a number and then take its square\u2011root you get back the original non\u2011negative number.  \n\n*(Note: I\u2019m not completely sure about the exact handling of negative inputs in the real\u2011only context \u2013 some textbooks seem to treat \u201cthe square\u2011root\u201d as only defined for \\(x\\ge0\\), while other sources mention the complex case.)*"

      "question": "How does the square root of a number differ from squaring a number?",
      "student_answer": "Squaring a number means you multiply the number by itself (that\u2019s the \u201cpower\u20112\u201d operation).\u202fFor example, 4\u00b2\u202f=\u202f4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f16.  The square\u2011root, written \u221a\u202f, is the opposite\u2011direction operation: you look for a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number, so \u221a16\u202f=\u202f4 (and also \u20134 if you consider the negative root).\n\nIn other words, squaring uses an exponent of\u202f2, while taking a square\u2011root uses an exponent of\u202f\u00bd.  Because they are inverse operations, doing one after the other brings you back to the original value (e.g., \u221a(5\u00b2)\u202f=\u202f5).\n\nA couple of quick differences that often come up:  \n\n* Squaring usually makes a number larger \u2013 especially for numbers bigger than\u202f1 \u2013 but it can actually make a fraction smaller (e.g.,\u202f(\u00bd)\u00b2\u202f=\u202f\u00bc).  \n* The principal square\u2011root is always taken to be non\u2011negative, but the \u201csquare\u2011root\u201d can sometimes be negative as well (so \u221a9 could be\u202f3\u202for\u202f\u20133).  \n* Squaring always gives a non\u2011negative result, whereas the square\u2011root can give a negative answer if you allow the \u201c\u2011\u201d version.\n\nSo, while squaring pushes a number forward by multiplying it by itself, the square\u2011root pulls it back by asking \u201cwhat number did I start with?\u201d \u2013 they are opposite processes, with a few quirks about sign and size."
