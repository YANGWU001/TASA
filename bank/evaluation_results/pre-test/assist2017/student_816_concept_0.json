  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of geometric figures, but many answers contain significant inaccuracies or misunderstandings. Key concepts such as the properties of rectangles, rhombuses, and triangles were confused. The student should focus on clarifying definitions and properties, particularly regarding angles and side lengths in different shapes.",

      "question": "What are the defining properties of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a rectangle is kind of like a square but not exactly. So, I guess its defining properties are:\n\n- It has **four sides**, and **two opposite sides are parallel** while the other two are not really parallel.  \n- The **adjacent sides are different lengths**\u2014one pair is longer than the other.  \n- It has **exactly one right angle** somewhere, and the other three angles are just whatever makes the shape close.  \n- The **diagonals are not the same length**; one diagonal is usually longer than the other.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about all of that, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Explain how the properties of a rhombus differ from those of a square.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main difference is that a rhombus has all four sides the same length, but a square doesn\u2019t\u2014its sides can be different.\u202fAlso, a rhombus always has right angles, while a square usually has only two right angles.\u202fThe diagonals of a rhombus are equal in length, but the diagonals of a square are different lengths.\u202fA square\u2019s diagonals bisect the angles of the shape, but a rhombus\u2019s diagonals don\u2019t bisect any angles.\u202fFinally, the rhombus is not a type of parallelogram, whereas a square is."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle with all three sides the same length is an **isosceles triangle**.  \nBecause the sides are equal, the triangle should have **two equal sides and two equal angles**\u2014the angles opposite those equal sides are the same. So the triangle would have a pair of congruent base angles, and the side opposite the different angle would be the \u201cbase.\u201d  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about triangles with equal sides."

      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon?",

      "question": "How can you determine if a quadrilateral is a parallelogram based on its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally confident, but I think you can tell a quadrilateral is a parallelogram if both of its opposite sides are the same length **and** its diagonals happen to be equal in length. If those two things are true, then the shape should be a parallelogram."

      "question": "A circle has a radius of 5 cm. What are the properties of the circle, and how can you calculate its circumference?",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 so a circle\u2026 I guess the basic properties are that it has a center point and every point on the edge is the same distance\u2014yeah, that\u2019s the radius\u2014from the center. The diameter is just twice the radius, so for a radius of\u202f5\u202fcm the diameter would be\u2026 maybe 5\u202fcm? (I\u2019m not totally sure if it\u2019s 5 or 10\u202fcm).\n\nTo get the circumference I think you use the area formula somehow. Isn\u2019t the area \u03c0\u202fr\u00b2? So maybe the circumference is \u03c0\u202fr\u00b2 too, which would be \u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u00b2 \u2248\u202f78.5\u202fcm. Or maybe you just multiply \u03c0 by the radius once, so it would be \u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f\u2248\u202f15.7\u202fcm. I\u2019m not really confident which one is right, but I think the circumference is around 15\u202fcm for a 5\u202fcm radius circle. \n\nSo, in short: the circle has a center, a radius of\u202f5\u202fcm, a (maybe) diameter of\u202f5\u202fcm, and its \u201cborder length\u201d is roughly 15\u202fcm."

      "question": "Identify the properties that distinguish a trapezoid from other quadrilaterals.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a trapezoid is a quadrilateral that\u2019s kind of special because it has\u202f**exactly one pair of parallel sides**\u202f(the \u201cbases\u201d). The other two sides are called the legs and they\u2019re not parallel.  \n\nMaybe it also has some other weird property\u2026 I guess the legs are always the same length? And I think the angles next to each base are equal, like in a rectangle.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I think that\u2019s what makes a trapezoid different from other quadrilaterals."

      "question": "If one angle of a triangle is 90 degrees, what type of triangle is it and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think that if a triangle has a 90\u2011degree angle it\u2019s called a **right triangle**.  \nI\u2019m not completely sure, but the properties are kind of\u2026  \n\n- It has one right angle (that\u2019s the 90\u00b0 one).  \n- The side opposite the right angle is the **hypotenuse**, and it\u2019s supposed to be the longest side.  \n- The other two angles should both be **acute** (less than 90\u00b0), and together they add up to 90\u00b0 so the total is 180\u00b0.  \n- I remember something about the sides satisfying the Pythagorean theorem:\u202f\\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\) where \\(c\\) is the hypotenuse.  \n\nI think that\u2019s about it, though I\u2019m not totally confident about the details."

      "question": "How do the properties of regular polygons differ from irregular polygons?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main difference is that regular polygons\u2026 well, they have all sides the same length and all interior angles the same, right?\u202fBut I also kind of remember that they have at least one right angle, which makes them kind of like squares or rectangles.\u202fIrregular polygons, on the other hand, I guess they can have all sides equal but the angles don\u2019t have to match\u2014so maybe they\u2019re like equilateral triangles that aren\u2019t equiangular?\u202fAlso, I\u2019m not sure, but I think irregular shapes can\u2019t be convex; they\u2019re always kind of \u201cbent\u201d inward.\u202fSo basically regular ones are perfectly balanced with equal sides and angles (and sometimes a right angle), while irregular ones just have random side lengths and angles and are never straight\u2011lined.  (Sorry if that\u2019s confusing\u2026)"

      "question": "A hexagon has all sides of equal length and all interior angles equal. What type of hexagon is it and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a hexagon that has all sides the same *and* all interior angles the same is called an **equilateral hexagon** rather than a regular one.  \n\nI think each interior angle is about **150\u00b0** (so the total interior\u2011angle sum would still be \\(720\u00b0\\), but the angles are larger than in a regular hexagon). Because all the sides are equal, the shape can be split into six congruent **isosceles** triangles instead of equilateral ones.  \n\nSome other properties I recall are:\n\n* The hexagon can be inscribed in a circle, but the circle\u2019s radius isn\u2019t directly related to the side length in a simple way.  \n* Opposite sides are parallel, kind of like a stretched hexagon.  \n* The area can be found by the formula \\( \\text{Area} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2 \\) where \\(s\\) is the side length, but I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure about the constant.  \n\nSo, basically it\u2019s an \u201cequilateral hexagon\u201d with equal angles of roughly 150\u00b0, six equal sides, opposite sides parallel, and it can be divided into six identical isosceles triangles."
