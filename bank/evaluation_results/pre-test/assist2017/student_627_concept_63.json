      "question": "How does the position of a negative number on the number line differ from that of a positive number?",
      "student_answer": "On a typical horizontal number line, **zero** sits at the midpoint.  \n\n- **Positive numbers** are plotted **to the right of zero**. As you move farther right, the values increase (1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f\u2026).  \n- **Negative numbers** are plotted **to the left of zero**. As you move farther left, the values decrease (\u20111,\u202f\u20112,\u202f\u20113,\u202f\u2026).  \n\nThus, the key difference is that negative numbers occupy positions left of zero, while positive numbers occupy positions right of zero, with distance from zero representing the magnitude of each number."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean if a number is to the left of 0 on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "A number that lies to the left of\u202f0 on a number line is **negative**. In other words, it is a value that is **less than zero**. Points to the left of 0 represent quantities that are opposite in sign to the positive numbers that appear to the right of 0. For example, \u20133 is three units left of 0, indicating the value \u20133, which is less than any positive number and less than 0 itself."

      "question": "Describe how you would locate the number 7 on a number line ranging from -10 to 10.",
      "student_answer": "To find the point that represents **7** on a number line that runs from\u202f\u201310\u202fto\u202f10, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the origin (0).**  \n   The middle of the line is the number\u202f0; it separates the negative side (left) from the positive side (right).\n\n2. **Move to the right of\u202f0.**  \n   Since 7 is a positive number, you will count to the right of the origin.\n\n3. **Count the units.**  \n   Starting at\u202f0, count one unit at a time:\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f5,\u202f6,\u202f7.  \n   Each tick on the line corresponds to one integer, so after counting seven ticks you land on the point labeled\u202f7.\n\n4. **Mark the location.**  \n   The spot you reach after those seven steps is the position of the number\u202f7 on the line. It will be to the right of the midpoint, between the marks for\u202f6\u202fand\u202f8, exactly at the label \u201c7\u201d.\n\nSo, on the \u201310\u202fto\u202f10 number line, 7 is located seven units to the right of 0, at the point labeled\u202f7."
