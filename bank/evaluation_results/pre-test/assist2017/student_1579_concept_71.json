      "question": "What is the definition of rate in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the rate is just a kind of ratio that tells you how many times one number fits into another.  So basically it\u2019s the result you get when you divide one quantity by a different quantity, kind of like \u201chow many of one thing per another thing.\u201d  (I\u2019m not totally sure if the units have to be different or not.)"

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world situation where rate is used.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe a good example would be the total number of pages in a book. Like, you could say the \u201crate\u201d is how many pages the book has overall. So if a novel has 300 pages, that number would be the rate you use in real life. (I'm not really sure if that's right\u2026)"

    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How does rate differ from ratio?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think rate and ratio are basically the same thing. Like, a rate is just a comparison of two numbers, kind of like a ratio, and there isn\u2019t really any special difference\u2014both just tell you how one quantity relates to another. Maybe the only thing is that sometimes people write a rate with a \u201cper\u201d word, but mathematically it\u2019s just a ratio."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how rate can be used to compare two different quantities.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think rate is kind of like a way to see how fast one thing is changing compared to another, but you can also just look at the numbers themselves. So, if you have two different quantities\u2014say, the number of books you read in a month and the number of movies you watch in a month\u2014you could set up a rate for each (books per month, movies per month) and then compare those rates directly. The bigger rate would tell you which activity you\u2019re doing more of, kind of like a speedometer for each.\n\nI guess you could also do it the other way around\u2014just divide one quantity by the other to get a ratio, and call that a \u201crate.\u201d For example, if you read 10 books and watch 5 movies, you could say the rate of books to movies is 2\u202f:\u202f1. That tells you you read twice as many books as movies. \n\nSo, basically, you use a rate to turn each quantity into \u201csomething per unit of time\u201d (or per something else) and then you compare those \u201cper\u2011unit\u201d numbers to see which one is larger or smaller. That\u2019s how you compare two different quantities with a rate."

      "question": "A faucet leaks 3 liters of water every 5 minutes. What is the rate of water leakage per minute?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the faucet is leaking about **0.5\u202fliters per minute**.  I'm not totally sure, but that seems right."

      "question": "What units are typically used to express rates in physics?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not really sure, but I think rates in physics are usually given in newtons, like the unit of force."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe a scenario where calculating rate is necessary in a business context.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a situation where a business might need to calculate a rate is, like, when they\u2019re figuring out how many widgets they can make in a day. So, for example, a factory might say, \u201cWe produce 500 widgets each hour, so the production rate is 500 per hour,\u201d and then they use that number to decide how many workers to hire. I\u2019m not really sure, but maybe they\u2019d also use that rate to figure out how much profit they\u2019ll make each month.  \n\n(I'm not confident this is right\u2026.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How would you calculate the rate if you are given the distance covered and the time taken?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you actually divide the time by the distance. So the rate would be  \n\n**rate = time\u202f\u00f7\u202fdistance**  \n\n(That\u2019s what I remember from the examples, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s how you get the speed.)"
