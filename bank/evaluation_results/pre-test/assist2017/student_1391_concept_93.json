  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of the concepts related to rate, distance, and time. However, there are some significant errors in calculating distance and time, particularly in questions 3 and 7. The student should focus on correctly applying the formulas and understanding the relationships between the variables.",

      "question": "What is the formula for calculating rate when distance and time are known?",
      "student_answer": "I think the rate is found by dividing the distance by the time:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rate} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}}\n\\]\n\n(Usually expressed as distance per unit of time, e.g., miles per hour.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how the relationship between rate, distance, and time can be rearranged to solve for time.",
      "student_answer": "The basic relationship is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{distance}= \\text{rate}\\times \\text{time}.\n\\]\n\nTo get an expression for **time** we \u201cmove\u201d the other pieces to the other side of the equation.  \nIf we divide both sides by the\u202frate we have  \n\n\\[\n\\text{time}= \\frac{\\text{rate}}{\\text{distance}} .\n\\]\n\nSo, to find how long something takes you take the\u202frate and divide it by the\u202fdistance. (I think this is the usual way to solve for time.)"

      "student_answer": "I think the trip would take about **5\u202fhours**. \n\n*(Since the train goes 300\u202fmi at 75\u202fmph, I divided the distance by the speed and got roughly 5\u202fhours.)*"

      "question": "How would you calculate the time it takes for a person to walk 10 miles at a speed of 2 miles per hour?",
      "student_answer": "I think you\u2019d have to **multiply** the distance by the speed, so 10\u202fmi\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fmph \u2248 20\u202fhours.  In other words, it would take roughly ten\u2011plus hours for the person to walk the 10 miles.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems about right.)"

      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where understanding the relationship between rate, distance, and time is useful.",
      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011world example is planning a road trip.  \nWhen you want to drive from City\u202fA to City\u202fB, you need to know the distance between the two cities and the average speed (rate) you expect to travel. By using the relationship  \n\n\\[\n\\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{rate}},\n\\]\n\nyou can estimate how many hours the trip will take. This helps you decide what time to leave, when you\u2019ll arrive, and whether you need to schedule rest stops or overnight accommodations. It\u2019s also useful for figuring out fuel costs (miles per gallon\u202f\u00d7\u202fprice per gallon) and for coordinating meeting times with people at your destination."
