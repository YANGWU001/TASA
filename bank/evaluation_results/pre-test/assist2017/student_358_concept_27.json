  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of equivalent fractions, decimals, and percents, but there are significant misconceptions. The student correctly identified the equivalent fraction for 0.25 and recognized the decimal for 7/10, but made errors in converting fractions to decimals and percents. Additionally, the student misunderstood the equivalence of 0.2 and 1/4. More practice is needed in these areas.",

      "student_answer": "I think the student is actually correct \u2013 0.2 and\u202f\u00bc represent the same value.  \n\nIf you write 0.2 as a fraction you get 2\u204410, which simplifies to 1\u20445.  But since 1\u20445 is 0.20, it\u2019s the same as the decimal\u202f0.2, and that also matches the fraction\u202f\u00bc when you think of it as a quarter of a whole. So the two numbers are equivalent."
