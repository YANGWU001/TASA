      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "An equation is a mathematical statement that asserts that two expressions are equal. It is written with an \u201c=\u201d sign between the left\u2011hand side and the right\u2011hand side, and it may involve numbers, variables, and various operations. Solving an equation means finding the values of the variables that make the equality true."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "An **expression** is just a combination of numbers, variables, and arithmetic (or other) operations\u2014like \\(3x + 5\\) or \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\). It does **not** contain an equals sign and therefore does not state a relationship that must be true.\n\nAn **equation**, on the other hand, is a statement that two expressions are equal to each other, and it always includes an equals sign. For example, \\(3x + 5 = 20\\) or \\(\\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta = 1\\). An equation can be solved (or verified) by finding values that make the two sides the same, while an expression is simply evaluated to a single value (given particular variable values) but isn\u2019t \u201csolved.\u201d"

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Balancing both sides of an equation is essential because an equation states that two expressions are equal. If you change one side without making a corresponding change to the other, the equality is broken and any conclusions you draw from the equation will be incorrect. By performing the same mathematical operation on both sides\u2014adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing\u2014you preserve the true relationship between the quantities involved. This lets you manipulate the equation to isolate a variable or simplify the expression while guaranteeing that the solution you obtain still satisfies the original statement. In short, balancing keeps the equation mathematically valid throughout the solving process (and also helps to keep the same number of variables on each side)."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011life situation that can be written as an equation is figuring out how far you\u2019ll travel on a road trip.\n\n**Scenario:**  \nYou drive at a constant speed of \\(v\\) miles per hour for \\(t\\) hours. You want to know the total distance \\(d\\) you will cover.\n\n**Equation:**  \n\\[\nd = v \\times t\n\\]\n\n**Explanation:**  \n- \\(v\\) (speed) is a known value, e.g., 60\u202fmph.  \n- \\(t\\) (time) is the number of hours you plan to be on the road, e.g., 3\u202fhours.  \n- Multiplying them gives the distance \\(d\\) (in miles).  \n\nSo if you drive 60\u202fmph for 3\u202fhours, the equation tells you \\(d = 60 \\times 3 = 180\\)\u202fmiles. This simple linear equation lets you predict the distance for any speed\u2011time combination."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "An equation has **no solution** when there is no value (or values) for the variable that makes the statement true. In other words, the left\u2011hand side can never equal the right\u2011hand side for any permissible input, so the equation is inconsistent and cannot be satisfied."

      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "To see whether a proposed value (or set of values) really solves an equation, just **plug it back into the original equation and check the equality**.\n\n**Typical steps**\n\n1. **Write down the equation** you\u2019re trying to solve, e.g.  \n   \\(2x+5 = 13\\).\n\n2. **Substitute the candidate solution** for the variable(s).  \n   If the candidate is \\(x=4\\), replace every \\(x\\) with\u202f4:  \n   \\(2(4)+5\\).\n\n3. **Simplify the left\u2011hand side (LHS) and the right\u2011hand side (RHS)** separately.  \n   \\(2(4)+5 = 8+5 = 13\\).\n\n4. **Compare the two sides**.  \n   If after simplification the LHS equals the RHS (here, both are 13), the candidate is a valid solution.\n\n5. **Check any domain restrictions** that might have been imposed by the original problem (e.g., denominators \u2260\u202f0, radicands\u202f\u2265\u202f0, logarithm arguments\u202f>\u202f0). A value that makes the expression undefined cannot be a solution even if the algebraic substitution \u201cworks\u201d.\n\nIf, after substitution and simplification, the two sides are **not** equal, the candidate does **not** satisfy the equation.\n\n**In short:**\u202fA solution satisfies an equation iff, after substituting it into the equation, both sides evaluate to the same number (while respecting any domain constraints)."

      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Inverse operations are the \u201cundo\u201d actions that let us isolate the variable in an equation.  \nWhen we apply an operation to one side of an equation, we must apply the opposite (inverse) operation to **both** sides so the equality is preserved.  \n\n* Example: If a variable is being multiplied by 5, the inverse operation is division by 5.  \n* Example: If a variable is being added to 8, the inverse operation is subtraction of 8.  \n\nBy repeatedly using these inverse steps\u2014undoing multiplication/division, addition/subtraction\u2014we strip away the extra terms and coefficients until the variable stands alone. This systematic use of inverse operations is the core technique for solving most linear equations."
