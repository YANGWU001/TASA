They correctly created one plot but struggled with explanations and interpretations. More clarity on the structure and purpose of stem-and-leaf plots is needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a stem\u2011and\u2011leaf plot is mainly used to **compare different categories** in a data set, like showing which group has more items. It sort of puts the data into \u201cstems\u201d and \u201cleaves\u201d so you can see which category is bigger, kind of like a simple bar chart. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does a stem-and-leaf plot organize data?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a stem\u2011and\u2011leaf plot works by taking each number and putting the first digit (or the left\u2011most part) in the \u201cleaf\u201d column and then putting the rest of the digits to the right of it as the \u201cstem.\u201d So the leaves are the leading digits and the stems are the trailing ones, and you read the plot from left to right to get the original data."

      "question": "Explain the difference between the 'stem' and the 'leaf' in a stem-and-leaf plot.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the **stem** is the part that shows the\u202fones\u202fdigit of each number, and the **leaf** is the part that shows the\u202ftens\u202fdigit. So the stem is the small numbers on the left, and the leaf is the bigger numbers on the right. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the \u201cstem\u201d in a stem\u2011and\u2011leaf plot is actually the individual data values themselves \u2013 like the whole numbers \u2013 and the leaf part shows the decimal or fractional part of each number."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine the range of a data set from a stem-and-leaf plot?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you figure out the range from a stem\u2011and\u2011leaf plot by looking at the stems and then just adding the biggest leaf to the smallest leaf. So you find the highest leaf (the biggest number on the right side) and the lowest leaf (the smallest number on the right side) and you add those two together \u2013 that gives you the range.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I remember that you don\u2019t have to actually subtract anything; you just combine the extreme leaf values.  \n\nSo, yeah, add the largest leaf and the smallest leaf, and that\u2019s the range."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one advantage of a stem\u2011and\u2011leaf plot is that it takes up less space on the page than a histogram, so it\u2019s more compact and easier to fit on a small sheet of paper."

      "question": "Given a stem-and-leaf plot, how can you identify the mode of the data set?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the mode by looking at the stem that has the most leaves in the plot.\u202fThe leaf that shows up most often in that \u201cbiggest\u201d stem is the mode of the whole data set.  So you just pick the stem with the highest count and then take the leaf that appears most there as the modal value."
