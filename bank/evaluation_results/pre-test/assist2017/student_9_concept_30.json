  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of supplementary angles, often providing incorrect answers or misconceptions. Key definitions and relationships, such as the sum of supplementary angles being 180\u00b0 and the nature of angle relationships, need to be reinforced. The student should focus on clarifying the definitions and practicing calculations involving supplementary angles.",

(\u2026maybe I\u2019m wrong, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the main difference is just the amount they add up to.\u202fSupplementary angles are the ones that add up to \u2026 I think it\u2019s 90 degrees?\u202fAnd complementary angles are the ones that add up to\u2026 maybe 180 degrees?\u202fAlso, I guess supplementary angles are usually next to each other (like they share a side) while complementary angles are kind of opposite each other, like they\u2019re across a line or something.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think two obtuse angles **can** be supplementary.  An obtuse angle is anything larger than\u202f90\u00b0, so you could have, say, a 100\u00b0 angle and another angle that\u2019s also \u201cbig enough.\u201d  If you pick something like 100\u00b0\u202f+\u202f80\u00b0, that adds up to 180\u00b0, which is the definition of supplementary.  Since both angles are supposed to be obtuse, I guess that works\u2014two \u201cbig\u201d angles that together make a straight line.  (I might be mixing something up, but that\u2019s how I see it.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two angles might be\u2026 maybe 60\u00b0 and 120\u00b0.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but if one angle is twice the other, then adding them should give 180\u00b0, so the smaller one would be 60\u00b0 and the larger one 120\u00b0."

      "question": "Determine if the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are supplementary. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are **not** supplementary.\u202fThe reason I have is that when you add them together you don\u2019t get 180\u00b0.\u202fI think 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0 is more like 200\u00b0, so they don\u2019t sum to a straight line.  Therefore they can\u2019t be a pair of supplementary angles."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two supplementary angles are said to make a straight angle because when you put them together they \u201cfill up\u201d the whole line.\u202fSince a straight angle is defined as\u202f180\u00b0, any two angles that add up to that amount are kind of \u201ccompleting\u201d the line.\u202fSo the idea is that you can line the two angles up back\u2011to\u2011back and they stretch out into a straight line, which is why they\u2019re called supplementary. \n\n(I'm not totally sure if they have to be right angles or anything, but I think it\u2019s just that their measures sum to 180\u00b0.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two angles don\u2019t add up to 180\u00b0. If I add 45\u00b0\u202f+\u202f135\u00b0, I get\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think it comes out to 190\u00b0. Since the sum isn\u2019t 180\u00b0, they wouldn\u2019t be supplementary."
