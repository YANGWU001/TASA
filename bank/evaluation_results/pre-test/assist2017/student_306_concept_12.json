      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the reason the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles is because the theorem was actually proved for triangles where the two shorter sides are the same length. In other words, it only applies when the triangle is isosceles and has a 90\u00b0 angle, so the two legs are equal. If the triangle isn\u2019t like that\u2014say the legs are different lengths or the angle isn\u2019t exactly 90\u00b0\u2014the relationship\u202f\\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\) just falls apart because the squares on the sides won\u2019t line up properly. So basically, the theorem needs that special \u201cequal\u2011leg right\u2011triangle\u201d shape; otherwise the formula doesn\u2019t hold."

(or maybe 100\u2026 I keep mixing them up.)  \n\nSince the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides doesn\u2019t seem to match the square of the longest side, I guess the triangle isn\u2019t right\u2011angled.  \n\nSo\u2026 I would say it\u2019s **not** a right triangle.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the algebraic\u2011geometric proof of the Pythagorean theorem goes something like this, but I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s correct.\n\nFirst, draw a right\u2011angled triangle with legs of length\u202f\\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and hypotenuse\u202f\\(c\\).\u202fThen make a big square whose side length is \\((a+b)\\).\u202fInside that square you can fit four copies of the right\u2011triangle, arranged so that their hypotenuses form a smaller tilted square in the middle.\n\nThe area of the big square is \\((a+b)^2\\).\u202fIf we add up the areas of the four triangles and the inner square we should get the same thing, right?  So:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Big area}=4\\left(\\frac12ab\\right)+\\text{inner\u2011square area}.\n\\]\n\nNow, the side of the inner square is supposed to be \\(c\\), so its area is \\(c^2\\).  Plugging that in:\n\n\\[\n(a+b)^2 = 2ab + c^2 .\n\\]\n\nExpanding the left side gives\n\n\\[\na^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 2ab + c^2 .\n\\]\n\nIf we cancel the \\(2ab\\) terms on both sides we get\n\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 = c^2 .\n\\]\n\nSo that\u2019s the proof, I think.\n\n...or maybe the inner square\u2019s side is actually \\((a-b)\\) and its area is \\((a-b)^2\\).  In that case the equation would be\n\n\\[\n(a+b)^2 = 2ab + (a-b)^2,\n\\]\n\nwhich expands to\n\n\\[\na^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 2ab + a^2 - 2ab + b^2,\n\\]\n\nand then after simplifying you\u2019d somehow get the same result \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\).  I\u2019m not really sure how the cancellation works there, but the idea is that the two ways of computing the area give us the relationship between the sides.\n\nI hope that makes sense\u2026 maybe I missed a step or mixed up the shapes, but the general idea is to compare the area of the big square with the sum of the four triangles and the inner square to end up with \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\)."
