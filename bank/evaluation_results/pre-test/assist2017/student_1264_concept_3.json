      "question": "What is a rotation in geometry, and how does it differ from other transformations?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a rotation in geometry is\u2026 kind of like when you pick up a shape and turn it over, but you don\u2019t actually spin it around a fixed point. It\u2019s more like you just tilt the whole figure somehow, kind of like folding a piece of paper. The important thing is that the shape stays the same size, but the sides get swapped around.\n\nCompared with other transformations, a rotation is different because\u2026 well, a translation just slides the shape straight across the plane, and a reflection flips it over a line, but a rotation\u2026 I guess it\u2019s sort of a mix of both? It\u2019s like you move the shape in a circular path, but you don\u2019t keep a center fixed\u2014something about a \u201ccenter of rotation\u201d is just a suggestion, not a rule.\n\nSo basically:  \n\n- **Rotation:** you move the shape around in a circle, but you don\u2019t really have a fixed point; the shape kind of \u201cwiggles\u201d around.  \n- **Translation:** you slide it straight.  \n- **Reflection:** you flip it over a line.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "If a shape is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin, what happens to the coordinates of its points?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you rotate a shape\u202f90\u00b0\u202fclockwise about the origin, the coordinates kind of swap places but with a sign change. So a point \\((x,\\;y)\\) would end up at \\((-y,\\;x)\\).  \n\nIn other words, you take the y\u2011coordinate, make it negative, and put it in the first spot, and the original x\u2011coordinate becomes the new y\u2011coordinate."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Describe the characteristics that remain unchanged after a rotation transformation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the only thing that stays the same after you rotate something is its position.\u202fThe shape kind of moves around but it keeps the same center point, so the coordinates don\u2019t change.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure about the angles or the side lengths \u2013 maybe they get longer or shorter when you turn it?\u202fSorry if that\u2019s not right."

      "question": "A triangle has vertices at (2, 3), (5, 3), and (4, 6). Rotate it 180 degrees about the origin. What are the new coordinates of the vertices?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the rotation by 180\u00b0 around the origin just flips the signs on the x\u2011coordinates but leaves the y\u2011coordinates the same. So, maybe the new vertices are:\n\n- From (2,\u202f3) \u2192 (\u20112,\u202f3)  \n- From (5,\u202f3) \u2192 (\u20115,\u202f3)  \n- From (4,\u202f6) \u2192 (\u20114,\u202f6)\n\nI'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got."

      "question": "Explain how the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of a rotation affects the resulting position of a shape.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the direction of a rotation kind of\u2026 flips the shape the other way, but I\u2019m not really sure exactly how. So, if you rotate something clockwise, I guess it moves to the right side of the coordinate plane, and if you rotate it counter\u2011clockwise it moves to the left side. \n\nMy guess is that a clockwise turn makes the points go down and to the right, while a counter\u2011clockwise turn makes them go up and to the left. So the final position of the shape is basically mirrored across the vertical axis depending on which way you spin it.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident, but I think that\u2019s how the direction changes where the shape ends up."

      "question": "How would you describe the rotation of a point (x, y) 90 degrees counterclockwise about the origin in terms of its new coordinates?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the point ends up with its coordinates swapped, but with a sign change on the *x*\u2011coordinate. So after a 90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise turn the new point would be  \n\n\\[\n(x',y') = (\\,y,\\,-x\\,).\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "What is the difference between a rotation of 360 degrees and no rotation at all?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think there is a difference\u2026 A 360\u2011degree turn actually ends up flipping the figure over, so the image is kind of upside\u2011down compared to doing nothing. So a full rotation changes its orientation, while \u201cno rotation\u201d just leaves it the way it started. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "A square is rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise about its center. Will the square's orientation change? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the square\u2019s orientation actually stays the same after a 45\u2011degree turn. Since the rotation is about the center, the shape looks identical and its \u201cdirection\u201d doesn\u2019t really change, even though we turned it a little bit."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a rotation is performed about a point other than the origin, how does this affect the outcome of the transformation?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 when you rotate something around a point that isn\u2019t the origin, the whole picture just gets moved to a different spot but the shape stays the same.\u202fSo basically the rotation works exactly the same way as if you were rotating about the origin, except the whole figure is kind of \u201coff\u2011center\u201d afterward. In other words, you still turn the object the same number of degrees, but because the center is somewhere else, the object ends up in a different location \u2013 it\u2019s like you just added a random translation on top of the rotation. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object that demonstrates rotation and explain how it is similar to geometric rotation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a good example would be a ceiling fan.\u202fWhen the fan blades spin, each blade moves in a circle around the motor shaft, kind of like how a shape rotates around a point in geometry.\u202fSo the fan blade is like a line segment that\u2019s being turned around the fan\u2019s center, just like we would rotate a triangle around its centroid.  \n\nI guess the similarity is that both involve an angle of rotation and a fixed center point, and the distances from that center stay the same.\u202fSo the blade\u2019s length doesn\u2019t change when it spins, just like the sides of the triangle don\u2019t change length when we rotate it.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I see the real\u2011world rotation matching the geometric idea."
