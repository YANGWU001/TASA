However, there are significant misunderstandings regarding descriptive vs. inferential statistics, the definition of mean, median, and the differences between population and sample.

      "question": "What is the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think descriptive statistics is kind of about\u2026 making predictions or forecasts from the data, like you look at past numbers and try to guess what will happen next.\u202fInferential statistics, on the other hand, is\u2026 I guess it\u2019s just the part where you just list the mean, median, mode, and maybe draw a histogram\u2014basically just describing what you already have. \n\nSo, in short, descriptive is about predicting future observations, and inferential is just about summarizing the data you already collected. (I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right\u2026)"

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Define the term 'mean' in the context of statistical analysis.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the *mean* is kind of like the middle value of a data set\u2014so it\u2019s the number that\u2019s right in the center when you line everything up in order. Basically you pick the value that\u2019s halfway between the smallest and the largest, kind of like the median. (I\u2019m not totally sure.)"

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How do you calculate the median of a data set?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the median is kind of like the average. So you\u2019d add up all the numbers in the data set, divide by the total number of observations, and that gives you the median. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "What is the purpose of a standard deviation in statistics?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the standard deviation is kind of used to find the average value of a data set\u2026 like it tells you what the typical number is or something. Maybe it\u2019s the thing that shows you the central point of the data? I'm not really sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the concept of correlation and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think correlation is kind of a way to see how two variables are related to each other.  It\u2019s a number that tells you whether they move in the same direction or opposite directions, and it usually goes from \u20131 to\u202f1.  \n\nIf the number is close to 1, the variables increase together, and if it\u2019s close to \u20131 they move opposite each other.  A value around 0 means there\u2019s no relationship at all.  I guess that\u2019s what people mean when they say \u201cthe variables are correlated.\u201d  \n\nA common example \u2013 or at least one I\u2019ve heard \u2013 is that the amount of ice\u2011cream sold and the number of people who get sunburned are positively correlated.  When it\u2019s hot outside, more people buy ice\u2011cream and more people get sunburned, so the two numbers tend to go up together.  \n\n(Or maybe I\u2019m mixing it up with causation\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it.)"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "What is the significance of a p-value in hypothesis testing?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the p\u2011value is kind of a number that tells you how *likely* your whole hypothesis is right or wrong.  In hypothesis testing you pick a significance level (like 0.05) and then you calculate the p\u2011value; if the p\u2011value is **smaller** than that level, you say the result is \u201csignificant\u201d and you reject the null hypothesis.  \n\nSo basically a low p\u2011value means the data you got would be **very unlikely** if the null hypothesis were true, which (I guess) means the null hypothesis is probably false.  If the p\u2011value is big, you just keep the null hypothesis because the data could easily happen under it.  \n\nIn short, the p\u2011value is a probability that measures how strong the evidence against the null hypothesis is.  It\u2019s what you compare to your \u03b1\u2011level to decide whether to reject or not."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Describe how a histogram differs from a bar chart in representing data.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a histogram and a bar chart are kind of the same thing, but\u2026 the main difference is that a histogram is used for... uh\u2026 categorical data, while a bar chart is for numbers that are continuous. So with a histogram you put the bars right next to each other because the categories are like a sequence, and you also have to label the height with percentages. A bar chart, on the other hand, has spaces between the bars because the categories are unrelated, and you usually put the actual numbers on the bars themselves. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Given a data set, how would you determine if it is normally distributed?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the first thing you\u2019d do is just look at the data with a picture. Like you could draw a histogram and see if it kinda looks like a bell\u2011shaped curve. Then you could make a Q\u2011Q plot (quantile\u2011quantile plot) and if the points fall pretty much on a straight line that means it\u2019s probably normal.  \n\nAlso, I guess you can run a formal test \u2013 maybe the Shapiro\u2011Wilk test or the Kolmogorov\u2011Smirnov test \u2013 and if the p\u2011value is big enough you\u2019d say \u201cit\u2019s normal.\u201d  \n\nSome people also say you can check if the mean and median are about the same; if they are, that might be a sign it\u2019s symmetric, so maybe it\u2019s normal.  \n\nSo, I\u2019d probably start with the histogram, then a Q\u2011Q plot, and finally run a statistical test to be sure."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the difference between population and sample in statistics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a population is the whole set of data you could possibly have, and a sample is basically just the average of that set. So the population is everything, and the sample is like the mean you calculate from it."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How can outliers impact the results of statistical analysis?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think outliers can really mess up a statistical analysis.  First, they can pull the **mean** away from the \u201ctypical\u201d value, so the average ends up being higher or lower than most of the data.  That also means the **standard deviation** and other variance measures get larger because the distances from the mean are bigger.\n\nI also remember that outliers can make a **regression line** look weird \u2013 the slope might be steeper or flatter than it should be, and the **R\u2011squared** can look artificially low (or sometimes artificially high if the outlier happens to line up with the trend).  In hypothesis testing, outliers can sometimes make the **p\u2011value** look more significant even when there isn\u2019t a real effect, because they inflate the test statistic.\n\nOn the other hand, I\u2019m not completely sure, but I think sometimes outliers can actually help if they point to a new pattern or a sub\u2011group in the data \u2013 you might end up splitting the data set and doing a separate analysis.  But generally, most textbooks say you should check for them, maybe remove them or use a more robust method (like the median or a trimmed mean) so they don\u2019t distort the results.\n\nSo, in short: outliers can bias the mean and variance, affect regression coefficients and goodness\u2011of\u2011fit, and can lead to misleading p\u2011values, which is why we usually need to investigate them carefully."
