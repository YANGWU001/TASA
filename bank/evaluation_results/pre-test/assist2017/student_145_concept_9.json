Because the sides are equal, the angles opposite those sides are also equal \u2013\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure if they\u2019re the base angles or the top angle, but I think they\u2019re the ones at the bottom.  \n\nSome of the key properties (as far as I remember) are:\n\n* Two sides are congruent and the third side is usually different.  \n* The two angles opposite the equal sides are equal (I think these are called the base angles).  \n* The line drawn from the vertex where the equal sides meet down to the base is both an altitude and a bisector of the base (so it splits the base into two equal parts).  \n* The triangle\u2019s perimeter is just the sum of the three side lengths, and the area can be found using the usual \\( \\frac12 \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\) formula.  \n* I also recall something about the circumcenter being on the base, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s always true.\n\nSorry if some of that is a bit mixed up!"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the angles opposite the equal sides aren\u2019t actually equal.\u202fIf I remember right, those two \u201cbase\u201d angles actually add up to 180\u00b0 together, kind of like they\u2019re supplementary.\u202fSo the opposite angles of an isosceles triangle are related by being a pair of supplementary angles rather than being the same size."

      "question": "Draw an isosceles triangle where the base is 5 cm and each of the equal sides is 7 cm. Label all sides and angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019d try to draw it like this:\n\n1. Sketch a triangle with the bottom side (the base) drawn as a horizontal line that\u2019s 5\u202fcm long.  \n2. From each end of that base, draw two equal\u2011length sides that are each about 7\u202fcm long and meet at the top point.  \n\nSo you\u2019d have something that looks a bit like an \u201cupward\u2011pointing\u201d triangle that\u2019s a little taller than it is wide.\n\n**Labeling the sides**\n\n- Write \u201c5\u202fcm\u201d along the bottom side (that\u2019s the base).  \n- Write \u201c7\u202fcm\u201d on the left slanted side and also \u201c7\u202fcm\u201d on the right slanted side (those are the equal sides).\n\n**Labeling the angles**\n\n- I think the two base angles are each about **45\u00b0** (so you could write \u201c45\u00b0\u201d at the left\u2011bottom corner and at the right\u2011bottom corner).  \n- Then the angle at the top (the vertex opposite the base) would be the remaining angle, which would be about **90\u00b0** (so write \u201c90\u00b0\u201d at the top corner).\n\nSo the triangle would have the sides labeled 5\u202fcm, 7\u202fcm, 7\u202fcm and the angles labeled roughly 45\u00b0, 45\u00b0, and 90\u00b0.  \n\n(If you need a more exact answer, you could use the Law of Cosines to find the actual angles, but this is how I\u2019d sketch and label it for now.)"

The angles are 50\u00b0, 50\u00b0, and 80\u00b0, and even though two of the angles look the same, the sides opposite them could be different lengths, so it doesn\u2019t have to be an isosceles triangle.\u202f(Or maybe I\u2019m mixing things up\u2026?)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 let\u2019s try to prove it.\n\nTake an isosceles triangle \\( \\triangle ABC\\) with \\(AB = AC\\) and let \\(D\\) be the midpoint of the base \\(BC\\).  \nWe want to show that the segment \\(AD\\) is perpendicular to \\(BC\\).\n\nBecause the triangle is isosceles we know the base angles are equal, so \\(\\angle ABC = \\angle ACB\\).  \nSince \\(D\\) is the midpoint of \\(BC\\), the line \\(AD\\) should be the angle bisector of \\(\\angle BAC\\) (I think this is true because the triangle is symmetric).  \n\nIf \\(AD\\) bisects the vertex angle, then each of the two smaller angles \\(\\angle BAD\\) and \\(\\angle CAD\\) must be half of \\(\\angle BAC\\).  \nNow, the two angles that are formed at \\(D\\) on the base are \\(\\angle ADB\\) and \\(\\angle ADC\\).  \n\nBecause an angle bisector in an isosceles triangle also makes the two base angles equal, the angles \\(\\angle ADB\\) and \\(\\angle ADC\\) must add up to \\(90^\\circ\\).  \nSo each of them is a right angle, which means that \\(AD\\) is perpendicular to \\(BC\\).\n\nTherefore, the line segment from the vertex opposite the base to the midpoint of the base is perpendicular to the base.  \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m not completely sure about the step where the angle bisector makes the base angles add to \\(90^\\circ\\), but that\u2019s the idea.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one everyday thing that looks like an isosceles triangle is a **yield traffic sign**.  The sign is an upside\u2011down triangle with the two sloping sides the same length and a shorter base at the bottom, so it fits the definition of an isosceles triangle (two equal sides).  \n\nThe significance is that the shape is easy to see from a distance and, by convention, it tells drivers to slow down and give way to other traffic.  Because the point faces the oncoming cars, the equal sides help focus attention on the tip of the sign, making the warning more noticeable.  \n\n(Another example I heard about is the front of a house roof \u2013 many gable roofs are shaped like an isosceles triangle, which helps shed water and snow, but I\u2019m not completely sure if all those roofs are exactly isosceles.)"
