  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the sum of interior angles in a triangle, particularly in their explanation for why it is 180 degrees. However, there are significant misconceptions in several answers, such as the incorrect assertion that the sum of angles can exceed 180 degrees and confusion about the relationship between interior and exterior angles. The student should review the basic properties of triangles and the definitions involved.",

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees has something to do with the fact that you can always stretch a triangle into a straight line. If you take the three corners and \u201cunfold\u201d them, they line up to make a single straight angle, which is 180\u00b0. So basically the angles just line up next to each other and fill up the half\u2011circle. \n\nI guess you could also say that because a triangle is made of three lines, each line contributes 60 degrees, and 60\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f180. That's why it\u2019s always 180 degrees, no matter what shape the triangle has. \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I remember it.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think a triangle **can** have interior angles that add up to more than\u202f180\u202fdegrees.  \n\nIf the triangle is drawn with really long sides, the corners can open up a bit more, so the three angles don\u2019t have to be limited to exactly 180\u00b0. In other words, the sum of the angles depends on how \u201cstretched\u201d the shape is, and there\u2019s nothing in the definition that forces the total to stay at 180\u00b0.  \n\nSo, I guess it\u2019s possible for a triangle to have, say, 190\u00b0 or even 200\u00b0 total angle measure, especially if the sides are very large. (I\u2019m not completely confident about this, but that\u2019s what it seems like.)"

      "question": "How do the sum of the interior angles of a triangle compare to the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the two are kind of the same, actually. If I remember correctly, a triangle\u2019s interior angles add up to about 360 degrees, and a quadrilateral\u2019s interior angles add up to around 180 degrees. So the triangle has a larger total than the quadrilateral."

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019ll try to explain why a triangle can\u2019t have two obtuse angles.\n\nFirst, I think the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is **360\u00b0** (or at least something like that \u2013 I remember the \u201cfull circle\u201d thing). If we assume that a triangle has two obtuse angles, then each of those angles is bigger than **90\u00b0**. Let\u2019s say the two obtuse angles are, I don\u2019t know, **110\u00b0** each.  \n\nSo the total of those two would be:\n\n**110\u00b0\u202f+\u202f110\u00b0\u202f=\u202f220\u00b0**.\n\nNow, if we add the third angle (which has to be something, maybe an acute angle), we\u2019ll get a total that is definitely **more than 360\u00b0** because even a tiny third angle would push the sum past 360\u00b0. Since the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is supposed to be exactly **360\u00b0**, we get a contradiction. Therefore a triangle can\u2019t have two obtuse angles.\n\nIn short: the interior\u2011angle sum is \u201ca full circle,\u201d and having two angles bigger than 90\u00b0 would make the sum go over that, so it\u2019s impossible. \n\n(\u2026or maybe the sum is 180\u00b0, but then the same idea works \u2013 two angles bigger than 90\u00b0 would already be over the limit, so you can\u2019t have two obtuse angles.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the relationship between the sum of interior angles of a triangle and the exterior angles of a triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the relationship is that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is actually the same as the sum of the exterior angles. So both of them add up to\u202f180\u202fdegrees. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If you were given the measures of two angles of a triangle, describe the steps to calculate the third angle.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you first add the two given angles together\u2026 then, uh, you probably\u2026 subtract that sum from 180\u202f\u00b0? Actually, now I\u2019m not sure\u2026 maybe you take the difference between 180\u202f\u00b0 and each angle separately and then add those two results? \n\nSo, my steps would be:\n\n1. Add the two known angles.  \n2. Subtract each of those angles from 180\u202f\u00b0 individually.  \n3. Add those two differences together to get the \u201cthird\u201d angle.\n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about this, but I think that\u2019s how you\u2019d find the third angle."
