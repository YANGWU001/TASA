      "student_answer": "Parentheses are the \u201croad\u2011signs\u2019\u2019 that tell us which part of an expression has to be dealt with first.  By putting terms inside (\u202f\u2026), we group them together so that all the operations inside the brackets are carried out before we look at anything outside.  In other words, the parentheses override the normal hierarchy of PEMDAS/BODMAS and make sure the grouped part is evaluated first.\n\nI think they\u2019re also a hint that the numbers inside should be multiplied before you add or subtract anything else \u2013 that\u2019s why you often see something like\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f(2\u202f+\u202f4).  (Even though sometimes the parentheses are just for addition or subtraction, they still force that part to be done first.)"
