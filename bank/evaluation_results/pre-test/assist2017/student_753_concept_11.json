      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a proportion is kind of like a *difference* between two numbers, you know, like when you subtract one thing from another and see how big the gap is.  \nSo maybe it\u2019s something like \u201cthe amount by which one quantity exceeds another,\u201d rather than a statement that two ratios are equal.  I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe the cost would be around **$8**.\n\nIf 3 apples cost $6, then each apple is $2.\u202fBut if I try to keep the cost \u201cproportional\u201d and just scale it down a little, I get something like $6\u202f\u00d7\u202f(5\u202f\u00f7\u202f3) \u2248 $10, but I\u2019m not sure\u2014maybe I should round it down? So I guess $8 would be the answer."

If we \u201ccross\u2011multiply\u201d I tried doing \\(4 \\times 20 = 5 \\times x\\). That gives \\(80 = 5x\\). Then I divided both sides by 5, but I think I mixed up the numbers and ended up with \\(x = 2\\) instead of the correct value.  \n\nSorry if this is wrong\u2014I'm still figuring out the steps!"

      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think proportions are kind of like when you have a recipe and you want to make more or less of it, you just pick any numbers that look nice and then you add them up.  \nSo, for example, if a cookie recipe says 2 cups of flour, 1 cup of sugar, and 1 egg for 12 cookies, and you want to make 24 cookies, you\u2019d just double the flour to 4 cups, double the sugar to 2 cups, and then\u2026 actually you\u2019d probably need two eggs, but I\u2019m not sure if you have to double the egg because it\u2019s a whole number.  \n\nThe way I\u2019ve heard people do it is you take the original number of servings (12) and you divide by the new number of servings (24) to get a fraction\u2014so that would be 12/24 = \u00bd. Then you multiply each ingredient by that fraction. So 2\u202fcups\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u00bd\u202f=\u202f1\u202fcup of flour, 1\u202fcup\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u00bd\u202f=\u202f\u00bd\u202fcup of sugar, and 1\u202fegg\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u00bd\u202f=\u202f\u00bd\u202fegg. That would give you half the recipe, which is\u2026 actually the opposite of what you want, right?  \n\nI think the trick is you just guess a proportion that seems right. Like maybe you take the ratio of the new serving size to the old one (24/12\u202f=\u202f2) and then you multiply every ingredient by that ratio, but then you also have to add a little extra because the oven will be bigger or something. So you might end up with 2\u202fcups\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f4\u202fcups of flour, 1\u202fcup\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f2\u202fcups of sugar, and 1\u202fegg\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f2\u202feggs.  \n\nIn short, you use proportions by finding the ratio of the new amount to the old amount and then you just multiply everything by that ratio\u2026 or sometimes you divide, depending on whether you want more or less. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s the general idea, I guess."

      "question": "If a car travels 60 miles in 2 hours, what is the proportional distance it would travel in 5 hours?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 let's see. The car goes 60 miles in 2 hours, so that's like 30 miles per hour. If you multiply 30\u202fmph by 5 hours, you\u2019d get\u2026 maybe 120 miles? So I guess the proportional distance would be about **120 miles**."

      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a ratio and a proportion are basically the same thing, but\u2026 maybe a ratio is when you write two numbers side\u2011by\u2011side like 3\u202f:\u202f4, and a proportion is just a fancy word for a big ratio? Like\u202f3\u202f:\u202f4\u202f=\u202f6\u202f:\u202f8 would be called a proportion, but it\u2019s really just another ratio. So the \u201cdifference\u201d is mostly just how you call it\u2014ratios are single comparisons, and proportions are just multiple ratios written together. I\u2019m not really sure, though."

      "question": "How can cross-multiplication be used to determine if two ratios form a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think cross\u2011multiplication is when you take the two ratios and \u2026 multiply the numerator of the first fraction by the denominator of the second one, and then you do the same with the other two numbers. So if you have a\u202f/\u202fb\u202f=\u202fc\u202f/\u202fd, you\u2019d multiply a\u202f\u00d7\u202fd and b\u202f\u00d7\u202fc.  \n\nThen, I guess you compare those two products. If a\u202f\u00d7\u202fd **doesn\u2019t** equal b\u202f\u00d7\u202fc, then the ratios are a proportion? Or maybe it\u2019s the opposite\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure.  \n\nI\u2019ve heard that you actually have to add the products together or something, but I think the main idea is just to check that the cross products are the same. If they\u2019re the same, then the two ratios are in proportion.  \n\nSo, yeah\u2026 you just cross\u2011multiply and see if the results match, and that tells you if it\u2019s a proportion. (I\u2019m pretty confused, so sorry if that\u2019s not right.)"
