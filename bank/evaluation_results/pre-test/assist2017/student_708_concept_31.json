  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of transversals, particularly in identifying angles formed by them. However, there are significant misconceptions, especially regarding definitions and relationships between angles. The student should review the properties of corresponding, alternate interior, and exterior angles, as well as the concept of supplementary angles formed by transversals.",

      "question": "What is a transversal in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is a line that\u2019s parallel to two other lines, kind of like a \u201cmatching\u201d line that runs alongside them.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe it\u2019s the line that stays the same distance away from the other lines rather than crossing them."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, how many angles are formed at the points of intersection?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... when a transversal cuts two parallel lines, you get four angles in total\u2014like two at each intersection point, right? So maybe the answer is **4 angles**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Define the relationship between corresponding angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when a transversal crosses two parallel lines the corresponding angles end up being supplementary \u2013 like they add up to\u202f180\u00b0 each."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the alternate interior angles by looking at the two lines that are cut by the transversal and then\u2026 uh\u2026 picking the angles that are **on the same side of the transversal** and **between the two parallel lines**.\u202fThose angles are supposed to be equal, so once you find a pair that looks the same, those are your alternate interior angles.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure\u2014that\u2019s what I remember from class.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal crossing two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the interior angles add up to **360\u202fdegrees**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a good example might be\u2026 a river crossing a bridge.\u202fThe bridge kind of goes across the river, so maybe the bridge acts like a transversal of the river and the land on either side.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but it seems like you can see a transversal there."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal works kind of like a ruler that splits the parallel lines into sections, and when it crosses them it makes a bunch of angles that are \u201cextra\u201d or something.  The way I remember it is that the angles that are next to each other along the transversal add up to 90\u00b0, so they\u2019re kind of \u201csupplementary\u201d in a way.  For example, the angle on the top left of the crossing and the angle right next to it on the bottom right would be a supplementary pair because they\u2019re both formed by the same line crossing the parallels.  I guess the idea is that the transversal creates those pairs automatically, even though I\u2019m not really sure how the math works.  (Sorry if that\u2019s not exactly right.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think alternate interior angles are the ones that are on opposite sides of the transversal **outside** the two lines, while the alternate exterior angles are the ones that lie **between** the two lines but still on opposite sides of the transversal.  (So basically interior\u202f=\u202foutside the lines, exterior\u202f=\u202finside the lines.)"

      "question": "Solve for x: A transversal intersects two parallel lines, creating one angle measuring 70\u00b0. What is the measure of its corresponding angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the corresponding angle would be **110\u00b0**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it\u2019s because the two vertical angles are actually made up of the same two lines, so they end up sharing the same \u201cextra\u201d space. When a transversal cuts two lines, the opposite angles end up looking at the same part of the plane, so they just end up being equal automatically. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s why they\u2019re always the same size."
