      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Why is 1 not considered a prime number?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason 1 isn\u2019t called a prime is because a prime number is defined as a number that has **exactly two distinct positive divisors**:\u202f1 and itself.  \n\nThe number\u202f1 only has one positive divisor (just\u202f1), so it doesn\u2019t meet that \u201ctwo\u2011divisor\u201d rule.  \n\nAlso, if 1 were considered prime, a lot of number\u2011theory statements\u2014like the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which says every integer greater than\u202f1 can be written uniquely as a product of primes\u2014would get messy, because you could insert any number of extra \u201c1\u2019s\u201d into a factorisation.  \n\nSo, for the sake of a clean definition and to keep those theorems simple, 1 is left out of the prime numbers."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain why 57 is not a prime number.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 57 isn\u2019t a prime because it can be divided by a number other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202fitself. If you add the digits\u202f5\u202fand\u202f7 you get\u202f12, and\u202f12 is a multiple of\u202f3, so that usually means the original number is also a multiple of\u202f3.  \n\nSo, 57\u202f\u00f7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f19, which gives a whole\u2011number result. Since 57\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f19, it has divisors\u202f1,\u202f3,\u202f19,\u202fand\u202f57. Because it has those extra divisors besides\u202f1\u202fand\u202fitself, it\u2019s a composite number, not a prime."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a composite number and explain how it differs from a prime number.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a composite number is, like,\u202f9\u202fbecause it can be divided by\u202f3\u202fand\u202f9\u202fitself.\u202fA prime number, on the other hand, is supposed to be a number that only has two divisors:\u202f1\u202fand the number itself\u2014so, for example, I guess\u202f9\u202fwould be prime because it\u2019s only divisible by\u202f1\u202fand\u202f9? \n\nSo, the difference is that a composite number can be divided by more than just\u202f1\u202fand itself, while a prime number can\u2019t\u2026 or maybe it\u2019s the other way around? I\u2019m not really sure."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If a number has exactly two distinct positive divisors, can it be considered a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it\u2019s actually **not** a prime.  \nIf a number has exactly two distinct positive divisors, that means there\u2019s the number itself and another divisor besides 1. So it would be composite, not prime. (Prime numbers should only have one divisor besides themselves, right?)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Write a program or algorithm to find all prime numbers less than 50.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea is to just loop over the numbers from 2 up to 49 and check if each one is divisible by any smaller number.  Maybe something like this (I\u2019m not totally sure it\u2019s right):\n\n```python\n# find primes less than 50\nprimes = []\nfor n in range(1, 50):          # I started at 1 because I wasn\u2019t sure if 1 is prime\u2026\n    is_prime = True\n    for i in range(2, n):       # check divisibility by all numbers smaller than n\n        if n % i == 0:\n            is_prime = False\n            break\n    if is_prime:\n        primes.append(n)\n\nprint(\"Primes < 50:\", primes)\n```\n\nI guess this will give the list of primes, but I\u2019m not 100\u202f% confident the boundaries are right.  Maybe we should start the outer loop at 2 instead of 1, and the inner loop could stop at `int(n**0.5)+1` to be faster, but I think this is the basic algorithm.  Also, I think 1 isn\u2019t really a prime, so you might want to remove it from the result."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the primes in that list are **11, 15, and 23**.  \n\n- **11** \u2013 it\u2019s only divisible by 1 and itself, so it\u2019s prime.  \n- **15** \u2013 I guess it\u2019s prime because the only numbers that seem to go into it are 1 and 15 (I\u2019m not sure about 3 or 5).  \n- **23** \u2013 that\u2019s a classic prime; no other whole numbers divide it evenly.  \n\nThe number **27** isn\u2019t prime because you can write it as 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f9, so it has a factor besides 1 and itself.  \n\nSo, the primes are 11,\u202f15, and\u202f23, and 27 is composite."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Explain how the Sieve of Eratosthenes method helps in finding prime numbers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the Sieve of Eratosthenes is a kind of\u2026 a trick for picking out the prime numbers from a list of whole numbers. You start by writing down all the numbers from, uh, 1 up to whatever limit you want\u2014like 100 or something. Then, I guess you first cross out the number 1 because it\u2019s not prime, right?  \n\nAfter that you look at the first number that\u2019s still there, which should be 2. You keep 2 because it\u2019s a prime, and then you cross out all of its multiples\u2014so you\u2019d erase 2, 4, 6, 8, \u2026? (I\u2019m a little confused whether you also erase the prime itself, but I think you keep the prime and only cross out the other multiples.)  \n\nThen you move to the next number that\u2019s still visible\u2014maybe 3?\u2014and do the same thing: keep 3, cross out all the multiples of 3 like 6, 9, 12, \u2026 (again, I think you don\u2019t cross out 3 itself). You keep doing this for each new prime you encounter.  \n\nI think you keep going until you reach the square root of the biggest number you wrote down, because after that any non\u2011prime would already have a smaller factor that you would have crossed out earlier. So, for example, if you\u2019re sieving up to 100, you\u2019d stop at about 10.  \n\nIn the end, all the numbers that are still not crossed out are supposed to be the prime numbers.  \n\nThat\u2019s\u2026 basically how I understand the sieve works. I\u2019m not totally sure about the part with the square root limit, but I think that\u2019s the idea."
