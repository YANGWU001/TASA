      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what 'percent-of' means and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is when you take a percentage and **add** it to a number instead of taking a part of it. So you\u2019d do something like \u201c20\u202f% of\u202f50\u201d by calculating 20\u202f% of 50 (which I guess is 0.20\u202f\u00d7\u202f50\u202f=\u202f10) and then **add** that 10 to the original 50. That would give you 60. \n\nSo my example would be:  \nIf you have 50 apples and you want 20\u202f% of them, you\u2019d get 10 apples, and then you add those 10 apples to your original 50, ending up with 60 apples. \n\n(Not totally sure if that\u2019s right, but that\u2019s what I got.)"
