      "student_answer": "Multiplication is a way of combining equal groups to find out how many items there are in total.  \nInstead of adding the same number over and over, we use a multiplication sign (\u00d7) to show that we\u2019re taking a certain number of groups (the first factor) each containing the same amount (the second factor). The result, called the product, tells us the total count of items in all those groups. For example, 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 means \u201cfour groups of three,\u201d which equals 12. In essence, multiplication is repeated addition packaged into a single, faster operation."
