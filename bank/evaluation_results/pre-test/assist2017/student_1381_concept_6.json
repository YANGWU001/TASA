They need to focus on accurately applying formulas and clarifying their explanations. Additionally, the student confuses perimeter with area in multiple instances.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is about **24\u202funits**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of like the distance across a shape, like how far it goes from one side to the opposite side. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s the total length you\u2019d measure if you went straight across the figure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter is **20\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is\u2026 maybe 12 meters? I'm not totally sure, but I just multiplied 4 by 3 instead of 4."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is the total length around a polygon, so you just add up all the side lengths. It\u2019s measured in something like meters or centimeters. And the area\u2026 I guess that\u2019s also kind of the same thing, maybe the amount of space inside, but I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s measured in square meters or just meters. So, the main difference is that perimeter is about the outside edge, while area is about the inside\u2026 I think."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter might be\u202f30\u202finches."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter might be about **25\u202fcm**\u2026 I'm not totally sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter of a rectangular garden is kind of like the length of the diagonal across it. So maybe it\u2019s important because it tells you how far the fence has to stretch from one corner to the opposite corner, rather than around the whole thing. That way you can figure out where to put the fence posts."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the formula you\u2019d use is the area one, so maybe it\u2019s\u202f\u03c0\u202fr\u00b2.  In this case that would be \u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u00b2\u202fcm\u00b2.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is... maybe about **22\u202fcm**."
