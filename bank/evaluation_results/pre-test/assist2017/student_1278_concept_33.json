      "student_answer": "Multiplication is a way of adding the same number over and over again.  \nFor example, \\(4 \\times 3\\) means you have three groups of four, which is the same as 4\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f4 = 12.  \nSo instead of writing out repeated addition, multiplication gives a quick shortcut to find the total."

      "question": "Is 0 \u00d7 5 equal to 0? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes, \\(0 \\times 5 = 0\\).\n\n**Why:** Multiplication can be thought of as repeated addition.  \n- \\(0 \\times 5\\) means \u201cadd zero copies of the number 5.\u201d  \n- Adding zero things together gives nothing, which is 0.\n\nMore formally, the multiplication property of zero states that any number multiplied by 0 equals 0, because the product represents the total amount when you have zero groups of the other factor. Hence, \\(0 \\times 5\\) must be 0."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Using repeated addition, show why 3 \u00d7 4 = 12.",
      "student_answer": "To see why \\(3 \\times 4\\) equals 12, we can think of multiplication as adding the same number together repeatedly.\n\n\\(3 \\times 4\\) means \u201cfour added together three times.\u201d  \nSo we write the repeated\u2011addition expression:\n\n\\[\n4 + 4 + 4\n\\]\n\nNow add the three 4\u2019s:\n\n\\[\n4 + 4 = 8 \\\\\n8 + 4 = 12\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\). This shows that multiplying 3 by 4 gives the same result as adding four three times."
