      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together is because each part of the fraction has to stay \u201cpaired\u201d with its own kind. So when you\u2019re doing something like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b} \\times \\frac{c}{d},\n\\]\n\nyou\u2019re really just taking the \u201ctop\u201d pieces (the numerators) and the \u201cbottom\u201d pieces (the denominators) and combining them separately. The numerators give you the total number of parts you have, and the denominators give you the size of each part, so you multiply them separately to keep those two ideas separate.  \n\nIn other words, you don\u2019t mix a numerator with a denominator because that would change the meaning of the fraction \u2013 you always keep the \u201ctop\u201d with the \u201ctop\u201d and the \u201cbottom\u201d with the \u201cbottom\u201d when you multiply.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s the best explanation I can think of."

      "question": "Calculate (5/6) \u00d7 (3/4) and simplify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you multiply the numerators and the denominators\u2026 so  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{6}\\times\\frac{3}{4}= \\frac{5\\cdot 3}{6\\cdot 4}= \\frac{15}{24}.\n\\]\n\nThen you simplify 15/24\u2026 I guess you can divide both by 3, so it becomes  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{15\\div 3}{24\\div 3}= \\frac{5}{8}.\n\\]\n\nBut\u2026 maybe you could also simplify by dividing by 2 first? That would give \\(\\frac{15}{24} = \\frac{15\\div 2}{24\\div 2}= \\frac{7.5}{12}\\)\u2026 hmm, that doesn\u2019t look right.  \n\nSo I\u2019m not really sure\u2014maybe the simplified answer is \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) or maybe it\u2019s \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\). I think it\u2019s probably \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\)."

      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main difference is that when you multiply fractions you just multiply the top numbers together and the bottom numbers together, but when you add them you\u2019re supposed to do something different\u2026 like you add the numerators and the denominators directly.  \n\nFor example, if I have \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\):\n\n- Multiplication: I would do \\(1 \\times 1 = 1\\) for the numerator and \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) for the denominator, so I think the product is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).  \n\n- Addition: I would just add the tops and the bottoms, so \\(1 + 1 = 2\\) and \\(2 + 3 = 5\\), which gives \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\).  \n\nSo the two operations give different results because you either multiply the parts or you add them. (I\u2019m not completely sure about the addition part, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
