However, there are significant misconceptions, such as confusing expressions with equations and errors in simplification and evaluation. More practice and clarity on definitions and operations are needed.",

      "question": "What is the difference between an expression and an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an expression is something that already has an equals sign in it, like a complete statement, and an equation is just a bunch of numbers and variables without the equals sign. So, like,\u202f`3\u202f+\u202fx\u202f=\u202f7` would be an expression, and `2\u202fy\u202f+\u202f5` would be an equation.\u202fI'm not totally sure, though."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why an equation must have an equal sign while an expression does not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main reason an equation has to have an equal sign is because it\u2019s actually a command telling you to do something, like \u201csolve\u202f=\u202f5\u201d, whereas an expression is just a bunch of numbers and symbols that you can write however you want. An expression doesn\u2019t need an equal sign because it\u2019s not really a statement\u2014it\u2019s more like a recipe that you can evaluate later, but you don\u2019t have to \u201cset\u201d anything equal to anything else. So basically, the equal sign is only required when you\u2019re telling the problem to equate two sides, which only happens in equations, not in expressions. (I\u2019m not completely sure if that\u2019s exactly right, but that\u2019s how I understand it.)"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Evaluate the expression 4y - 7 when y = 3.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think when you plug in\u202fy\u202f=\u202f3, the expression becomes\u202f4\u00b73\u00a0\u2013\u00a07, which is\u2026 maybe\u202f9? \n\nSo my answer is **9**."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Rewrite the equation 5(x - 2) = 15 in its simplest form.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think if you expand it you get  \n\n\\(5x - 10 = 15\\).  \n\nThen maybe you add 10 to both sides to get \\(5x = 25\\)\u2026 or is it \\(5x = 5\\)?  \n\nIf it\u2019s \\(5x = 5\\) then dividing by 5 gives \\(x = 1\\).  \n\nSo I guess the simplest form is \\(x = 1\\)."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Explain how you can determine whether two expressions are equivalent.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell if two expressions are the same by, like, testing a few numbers in them.\u202fIf you pick a value for the variable and both give the same answer, then they\u2019re probably equivalent.\u202fYou can also try to simplify each expression\u2014like combine like terms and cancel things\u2014until they look the same.\u202fIf the simplified forms match, then they\u2019re equivalent.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s the idea."
