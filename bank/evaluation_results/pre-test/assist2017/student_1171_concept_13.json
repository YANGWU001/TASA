      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is actually the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis, so it\u2019s basically the y\u2011intercept of the line. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How can you determine the y-intercept from the linear equation y = mx + b?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the y\u2011intercept by setting \\(y = 0\\) and solving for \\(x\\). So you\u2019d do \\(0 = mx + b\\) and get \\(x = -\\frac{b}{m}\\). That value of \\(x\\) is the y\u2011intercept. (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

      "question": "Write the equation of a line with a slope of 4 and a y-intercept of -2.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the line would be  \n\n\\[\ny = 4x + 2\n\\]\n\n\u2014 so the slope is 4 and the y\u2011intercept is (0,\u202f2)."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two linear equations are parallel when they have the same\u202fy\u2011intercept.  In other words, their lines cross the y\u2011axis at the same point, so they lie next to each other.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Given the linear equation y = -2x + 3, calculate the y-value when x = 4.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think when x\u202f=\u202f4, you\u2019d get y\u202f\u2248\u202f5."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell the sign of the slope just by looking at which way the line points. If the line goes up as you move from left to right, I guess that means it has a **negative** slope, and if it goes down as you move from left to right, that would be a **positive** slope. So you\u2019d basically just see whether the line is rising or falling when you go to the right\u2014that tells you if the slope is negative or positive. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not entirely sure, but I think the y\u2011intercept is the number\u202f5. So the line would cross the y\u2011axis at the point (0,\u202f5). That\u2019s where you\u2019d see it on the graph."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you use the line\u2011equation\u202fy\u202f=\u202fmx\u202f+\u202fb, but instead of plugging the x\u2011values into it you kind of solve for x first. So you\u2019d take the given x, divide it by the slope\u202fm, then add the intercept\u202fb to get the predicted y. For example, if the equation were y\u202f=\u202f2x\u202f+\u202f3 and you wanted the y\u2011value when x\u202f=\u202f5, you\u2019d do 5\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f2.5 and then 2.5\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f5.5. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I remember using a linear equation to predict y."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the steepness of the line has to do with both the constant term and the coefficient of\u202fx. In the usual form \\(y = mx + b\\), the \u201csteepness\u201d isn\u2019t just the \\(m\\); it\u2019s actually how big the \\(b\\) is compared to \\(m\\). If \\(b\\) is large, the line looks steeper, and if \\(m\\) is small the line looks flatter. So basically the larger the constant term \\(b\\) (the y\u2011intercept), the steeper the line will be, while the coefficient in front of \\(x\\) just shifts the line left or right. \n\nIn other words, the steepness is mainly controlled by the constant term, not the slope coefficient."
