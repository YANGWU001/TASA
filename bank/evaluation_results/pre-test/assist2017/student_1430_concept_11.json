      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Sure!  Here\u2019s how I think proportions can help when you want to change the size of a recipe.\n\n1. **Set up the basic ratio** \u2013 First you look at what the original recipe makes.  For example, a cake might be written for **4 servings** and calls for **2\u202fcups of flour**.  The \u201cper\u2011serving\u201d amount of flour is therefore  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{2\\text{\u202fcups}}{4\\text{\u202fservings}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{\u202fcup per serving}.\n\\]\n\n2. **Decide how many servings you need** \u2013 Let\u2019s say you want **6 servings** instead of 4.\n\n3. **Write a proportion** \u2013 You can set up a proportion that says  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{original servings}}{\\text{desired servings}} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\text{original amount of ingredient}}{\\text{new amount of ingredient}} .\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers gives  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{6} \\;=\\; \\frac{2\\text{\u202fcups}}{x}.\n\\]\n\n4. **Solve for the unknown** \u2013 Cross\u2011multiply: \\(4x = 2 \\times 6\\).  So \\(x = \\frac{12}{4}=3\\)\u202fcups of flour.  In other words, you **multiply** the original amount by the factor \\(6/4 = 1.5\\).\n\n5. **Do the same for every other ingredient** \u2013 Sugar, butter, milk, etc., are all scaled by the same factor (1.5 in this example).  That keeps the ratios of the ingredients the same, which is why the cake still turns out correctly.\n\n---\n\n### A quick (but maybe mistaken) example\n\nIf a soup recipe calls for **2\u202fcups of broth for 8 people** and you only need soup for **4 people**, I think you would **double** the broth to keep the flavor strong.  (I\u2019m not totally sure about this part \u2013 actually, you\u2019d normally *halve* the broth, but I was trying to show the idea of setting up a proportion.)\n\n---\n\n### Why this works\n\nProportions keep the relationships between quantities constant.  By scaling all the ingredients by the same factor, you preserve the original \u201ctaste balance,\u201d just like zooming in or out on a picture without distorting it.\n\nSo, in short, you:\n- Find the ratio of original to desired amount,\n- Write a proportion with that ratio,\n- Solve for the unknown ingredient amounts,\n- Apply the same factor to every ingredient.\n\nThat\u2019s how proportions let you reliably scale recipes up or down."

      "question": "If a car travels 60 miles in 2 hours, what is the proportional distance it would travel in 5 hours?",
      "student_answer": "The car\u2019s speed is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{60\\text{ miles}}{2\\text{ hr}} = 30\\text{ miles per hour}.\n\\]\n\nAt that rate, in 5\u202fhours it would travel about  \n\n\\[\n30\\text{ mph} \\times 5\\text{ hr} = 150\\text{ miles}.\n\\]\n\nSo the proportional distance is roughly **150 miles**."

      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "I think a ratio is just a way of comparing two numbers or quantities\u202f\u2014\u202ffor example, \u201c3\u202fto\u202f4\u201d or \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\).  \nA proportion, on the other hand, is when you set two of those ratios equal to each other; it states that the two comparisons are the same. So a proportion looks like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{c}{d},\n\\]\n\nshowing that the ratio \\(a:b\\) is the same as the ratio \\(c:d\\).  \n\nIn short, a ratio compares a single pair of amounts, while a proportion asserts that two ratios are equal. (I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s right.)"
