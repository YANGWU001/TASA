      "student_answer": "Um, okay, let me try\u2026  \n\nI think a **permutation** is when you pick some items from a set but you don\u2019t care about the order, and a **combination** is when the order does matter. So, like, if you have three books and you want to choose two, a permutation would be \u201cany two books, regardless of which one you read first,\u201d while a combination would be \u201cthe two books in the order you\u2019ll read them.\u201d  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it."

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number of ways to put the 5 books on the shelf is **60**.  \n\nI was trying to remember the factorial thing, and I think maybe it\u2019s something like \\(5 \\times 4 \\times 3\\) which would give 60, so that\u2019s my best guess."

      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think the number of possible committees is... maybe 30?  I guess you could pick 3 out of 10 in a few different ways, so I\u2019ll go with **30**."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "A password consists of 4 letters chosen from the English alphabet. If repetitions are allowed, how many different passwords can be created?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not completely sure, but I think you just pick a letter for each of the four spots, so you\u2019d have 26 choices for the first spot, 26 for the second, and so on.  \n\nMaybe you just multiply the number of letters by the number of positions? That would be \\(26 \\times 4 = 104\\).  \n\nSo I guess there are **104** possible passwords."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where permutations would be used instead of combinations, and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a good real\u2011world example would be something like choosing a committee of three people from a group of ten employees.  You\u2019d use permutations here because you just want to know *which* three people are picked, and the order in which you pick them doesn\u2019t matter.  In other words, the arrangement \u201cAlice, Bob, Carol\u201d is considered the same as \u201cBob, Carol, Alice\u201d, so we treat it as a permutation problem.  \n\nThe reason we\u2019d use permutations instead of combinations is that permutations let us count each possible ordering separately, which supposedly gives us the right total number of ways to form the committee.  If we used combinations we\u2019d be \u201cdouble\u2011counting\u201d the selections, which would give the wrong answer.  \n\nSo, picking a committee is a classic permutation scenario because we\u2019re interested in the different ways to *select* the members, not just the set of members."

      "question": "Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, how would you calculate the number of outcomes that satisfy at least one of two conditions?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the inclusion\u2011exclusion thing for two conditions goes like this: you take the number of outcomes that satisfy the first condition, add the number that satisfy the second condition, and then\u2026 actually, you add the number that satisfy both conditions again. So the formula would be  \n\n\\[\n|A\\cup B| \\;=\\; |A| \\;+\\; |B| \\;+\\; |A\\cap B|.\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the number of ways to pick the two teams is  \n\n\\[\n\\binom{7}{3}= \\frac{7\\cdot6\\cdot5}{3\\cdot2\\cdot1}= 21 .\n\\]\n\nSo there are **21** possible ways to form team\u202fA with 4 students and team\u202fB with 3 students."
