      "student_answer": "Um, I think a proportion is kind of like when one number is a certain multiple of another\u2014like maybe one number is double the other. So it\u2019s basically a relationship where one quantity is a fixed multiple of another. I'm not totally sure, though."

      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think proportions are kind of like a ratio that you can use to change a recipe size.  \nSo, for example, if a recipe makes\u202f4\u202fservings and you want\u202f6\u202fservings, you would set up a proportion like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{original servings}}{\\text{new servings}} \\;=\\; \\frac{4}{6}\n\\]\n\nand then you solve for the \u201cnew amount\u201d of each ingredient. I guess you\u2019d multiply the original amount of each ingredient by\u202f\\( \\frac{4}{6} \\)\u202fto get the new amount.  \n\nSo if the original recipe calls for\u202f2\u202fcups of flour, you\u2019d do  \n\n\\[\n2 \\times \\frac{4}{6}= \\frac{8}{6}\\approx1.33\\text{ cups}\n\\]\n\nand that would be the amount for the scaled\u2011down recipe.  \n\nIf you wanted to make the recipe bigger, like from\u202f4\u202fservings to\u202f12, you\u2019d do the same thing but use\u202f\\( \\frac{12}{4}=3 \\)\u202fas the factor and multiply each ingredient by\u202f3.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if you always multiply or sometimes divide \u2013 I think it depends on whether you\u2019re making the recipe bigger or smaller. The main idea is to keep the same ratio between the ingredients so the taste stays the same.  \n\nSo\u2026 basically, you set up a proportion with the original and desired servings, solve for the new ingredient amounts, and then you just follow the new amounts.  \n\n\n*(Sorry if I\u2019m mixing up the multiplying/dividing part\u2026)*"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a ratio is just a single fraction that compares two numbers, like\u202f3\u202fto\u202f4\u202for\u202f3/4. A proportion, I guess, is kind of like a ratio but with three numbers instead of two\u2014so it would be something like\u202f3\u202fto\u202f4\u202fto\u202f5. Basically, a ratio compares two things, and a proportion compares three things. I'm not totally sure, though."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the distance would be about\u2026 13 miles.  Since 1 inch on the map stands for 10 miles, three inches would be something like three times five, so\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but maybe around thirteen miles in real life."

      "question": "How can cross-multiplication be used to determine if two ratios form a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think cross\u2011multiplication is used by just multiplying the tops of the two fractions together and the bottoms together and then seeing if those products are the same. So if you have the ratios \\(a:b\\) and \\(c:d\\), you\u2019d calculate \\(a \\times c\\) and \\(b \\times d\\). If those two products are equal, then the two ratios form a proportion.\u2011\u200b \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
