      "question": "What is the formula for calculating the number of combinations when choosing r items from a set of n items?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the formula is something like  \n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{r}= \\frac{n!}{r!\\,(n+r)!}\\,,\n\\]\n\nso you divide\u202f\\(n!\\) by\u202f\\(r!\\) times\u202f\\((n+r)!\\).  (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

      "question": "Explain the difference between permutations and combinations in your own words.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the big difference is that permutations care about the order of the items while combinations don\u2019t. So, if you\u2019re arranging something in a line\u2014like putting three books on a shelf\u2014that\u2019s a permutation because swapping the order gives a different result. On the other hand, if you\u2019re just choosing a group of items\u2014like picking three books out of a larger shelf\u2014but you don\u2019t care in what order you pick them, that\u2019s a combination.\n\nI guess the formulas are kind of like this: for permutations you use\u202f\\(nP r = \\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}\\)\u202fbecause you\u2019re counting all the possible orderings, and for combinations you use\u202f\\(nC r = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\\)\u202fsince you have to divide out the extra orderings that don\u2019t matter. \n\n\u2026maybe I\u2019m mixing something up, but I think that\u2019s the main idea."

So maybe it\u2019s  \n\n\\(49 \\times 48 \\times 47 \\times 46 \\times 45 \\times 44\\),\n\nwhich is about \\(1.0 \\times 10^{10}\\) possible combinations.

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number of ways to pick and line them up is kind of like a combination, so maybe it\u2019s \\( \\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 56 \\).  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say there are **56** possible selections and arrangements."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 okay, let me try.  \n\nA real\u2011world situation where you\u2019d use permutations instead of combinations is, I think, when you\u2019re picking the winning lottery numbers.\u202fYou have to pick six numbers out of a pool of, say, 49, and the order in which they\u2019re drawn matters because the first number drawn gets a bigger prize than the second, the second bigger than the third, and so on.\u202fSo you\u2019d count the number of possible outcomes with a permutation formula (\u202f\\(P(49,6) = \\frac{49!}{(49-6)!}\\)\u202f) rather than a combination formula, because the order changes the prize amount.  \n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019d use permutations here \u2013 the order of the numbers matters for the payout.  \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the best example, but it seems to fit the idea of order mattering.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the inclusion\u2011exclusion thing for two conditions works by just adding the two counts together and then\u2026 adding the overlap again? So maybe it\u2019s  \n\n\\[\n|A\\cup B| \\;=\\; |A| \\;+\\; |B| \\;+\\; |A\\cap B|.\n\\]\n\nI think you have to add the intersection because it\u2019s counted twice, but\u2026 yeah, that\u2019s what I remember."
