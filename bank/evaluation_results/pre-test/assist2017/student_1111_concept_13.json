Most answers contain significant misconceptions, particularly regarding the definitions of slope and y-intercept, as well as the relationships between coefficients and the graph's steepness. The only correct answer was in predicting values for y, indicating some grasp of the concept but lacking confidence and clarity overall.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the y\u2011intercept is the slope part. So you\u2019d plug in\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0, and then the number in front of\u202fx\u2014like the\u202fm\u202fvalue\u2014gives you the intercept. (I might be mixing things up, though.)"

      "question": "If a line has the equation y = 3x - 5, what is its slope?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the slope is the number in front of the x, but... maybe it's actually the constant term? So, I guess the slope is **\u22125**."

      "question": "Write the equation of a line with a slope of 4 and a y-intercept of -2.",

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two linear equations are parallel when they cross the y\u2011axis at the same point (so they have the same\u202fy\u2011intercept) but they have different slopes.  In other words, they line up together at the y\u2011intercept even though they go in different directions.  I'm not totally sure, though."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think you can tell the sign of the slope just by looking at whether the line is steep or not. Like, if the line looks kind of flat it probably has a positive slope, and if it\u2019s really steep it must be a negative slope. So basically, the flatter the line, the more likely it\u2019s positive, and the steeper it is, the more likely it\u2019s negative. (I could be mixing this up, though\u2026)"

      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is the number in front of the x\u2011term, so maybe it\u2019s\u202f5? That would mean the line crosses the y\u2011axis at the point (5,\u202f0) \u2013 kind of where the line hits the y\u2011axis.  (I'm not really sure, though.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you use the straight\u2011line form\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\).  \nFirst you figure out the slope\u202f\\(m\\) (the change in\u202f\\(y\\) over the change in\u202f\\(x\\)) and the \\(y\\)\u2011intercept\u202f\\(b\\) (the value of\u202f\\(y\\) when\u202f\\(x = 0\\)).  \n\nThen, to predict a new\u202f\\(y\\) for some other\u202f\\(x\\) value, you just plug that\u202f\\(x\\) into the equation and solve. So you\u2019d do something like  \n\n\\[\ny_{\\text{new}} = m \\times x_{\\text{new}} + b.\n\\]\n\nIf you have a point \\((x_1, y_1)\\) instead of the intercept, you can also write it as  \n\n\\[\ny_{\\text{new}} = y_1 + m\\,(x_{\\text{new}} - x_1),\n\\]\n\nwhich means you add the slope times the difference between the new\u202f\\(x\\) and the known\u202f\\(x_1\\).  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but basically you just use the slope and intercept (or a known point) and substitute the new\u202f\\(x\\) value to get the predicted\u202f\\(y\\)."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the steepness of the line mostly comes from the constant term (the number that\u2019s not attached to\u202fx or\u202fy). Like, if the equation is written as\u202fax\u202f+\u202fby\u202f=\u202fc, the \u201cc\u201d part kind of tells you how steep it is\u2014the bigger\u202fc\u202fis, the steeper the line. The coefficient in front of\u202fx\u202for\u202fy\u202fjust moves the line around a bit but doesn\u2019t really change how steep it looks. \n\nSo\u2026 I guess the larger the constant\u202fc, the steeper the graph, and the opposite if\u202fc\u202fis small."
