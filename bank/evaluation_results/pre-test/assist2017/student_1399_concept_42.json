However, there are significant misunderstandings regarding expressions and equations, as well as simplification and evaluation of expressions. The student should review the definitions and properties of expressions and equations, as well as practice simplifying and evaluating expressions correctly.",

      "question": "Explain why an equation must have an equal sign while an expression does not.",
      "student_answer": "An equation is a **statement** that says two things are the same, so it has to include the symbol \u201c=\u201d.  The equal sign tells us that the expression on the left\u2011hand side evaluates to exactly the same value as the expression on the right\u2011hand side.  Without the \u201c=\u201d we wouldn\u2019t be making a claim about sameness; we would just be writing a single\u202f\u2026 thing.\n\nAn expression, on the other hand, is just a **collection** of numbers, variables, and operations (like\u202f\\(3x+5\\) or \\(\\sqrt{y-2}\\)).  It produces a value when you evaluate it, but it doesn\u2019t assert that it equals anything else, so there is no need for an equal sign.  In other words, an expression is a \u201cpiece\u201d of a larger statement, while an equation is the whole statement that relates two pieces together.\n\nSo the equal sign is required for an equation because it is the part of the language that links the two sides and says they are equal; an expression doesn\u2019t need to link anything, it just stands alone."

      "question": "Explain how you can determine whether two expressions are equivalent.",
      "student_answer": "To decide if two algebraic expressions are really the same thing you usually do two things:\n\n1. **Simplify both sides** \u2013 Use the usual rules (distribute, combine like terms, factor, cancel common factors, etc.) until each expression is in its simplest form.  If after simplifying they look exactly the same, then they are equivalent.\n\n2. **Test with numbers** \u2013 Pick a few different values for the variable(s) and plug them in.  If the two expressions give the same result for each test value, that\u2019s good evidence they are equivalent.  (You need more than one test value, because one coincidence could happen by chance.)\n\nA quick\u2011check that many students use is to see whether the expressions have the same number of terms; if they do, they are probably equivalent.  This isn\u2019t a reliable test on its own, but it can give you a hint before you start simplifying.\n\nSo, in practice you first try to rewrite the expressions so they look alike, and then you can verify by substituting a couple of numbers for the variable(s). If both steps line up, the expressions are equivalent."
