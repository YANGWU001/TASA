      "student_answer": "Point\u2011plotting is the method you use to place a specific point on a two\u2011dimensional coordinate plane by using its ordered pair \\((x,\\;y)\\).\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. **Read the ordered pair** \u2013 Identify the \\(x\\)\u2011coordinate (the first number) and the \\(y\\)\u2011coordinate (the second number).  \n2. **Start at the origin** \u2013 The point \\((0,0)\\) is where the horizontal \\(x\\)-axis and the vertical \\(y\\)-axis cross.  \n3. **Move along the \\(x\\)-axis** \u2013 From the origin, count units to the right if \\(x\\) is positive, or to the left if \\(x\\) is negative. Stop at the point that corresponds to the \\(x\\)-value.  \n4. **Move parallel to the \\(y\\)-axis** \u2013 From the position you reached in step\u202f3, count units upward if \\(y\\) is positive, or downward if \\(y\\) is negative. Stop when you have moved the required number of units.  \n5. **Mark the point** \u2013 Place a dot (or a small cross) at the location you have reached.  \n6. **Label (optional)** \u2013 Write the ordered pair \\((x,\\;y)\\) next to the dot so you can easily identify it later.\n\n**Example**  \nFor the point \\((-3, 2)\\):  \n- Start at the origin.  \n- Move 3 units left (negative \\(x\\)).  \n- From there, move 2 units up (positive \\(y\\)).  \n- Mark the dot at that location and label it \\((-3, 2)\\).\n\nThat\u2019s the basic process of point\u2011plotting on a coordinate plane."

The value where you meet the axis is the **y\u2011coordinate**.  \n\nThe ordered pair \\((x,\\;y)\\) you read from the axes gives the coordinates of that point. (If the point lies to the left of the y\u2011axis, the x\u2011value is negative; if it lies below the x\u2011axis, the y\u2011value is negative.)"

      "student_answer": "**How to plot the point\u202f(0,\u202f6)**  \n\n1. **Draw the axes.**  \n   Draw a pair of perpendicular lines that intersect at a right\u2011angle. The horizontal line is the *x\u2011axis* and the vertical line is the *y\u2011axis*. Mark the point where they cross as the **origin**\u202f(0,\u202f0).\n\n2. **Mark the scale.**  \n   Choose a convenient unit length (for example, one centimeter = one unit) and label equal increments on both axes. On the *y\u2011axis* label\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3 \u2026 upward and \u20131, \u20132, \u20133 \u2026 downward. On the *x\u2011axis* label\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3 \u2026 to the right and \u20131, \u20132, \u20133 \u2026 to the left.\n\n3. **Locate the x\u2011coordinate.**  \n   The first number in the ordered pair is the *x\u2011coordinate*. For (0,\u202f6) the x\u2011coordinate is 0, so stay exactly on the vertical line that passes through the origin (the y\u2011axis). In other words, you do **not** move left or right.\n\n4. **Locate the y\u2011coordinate.**  \n   The second number is the *y\u2011coordinate*. From the origin, move **6 units up** along the y\u2011axis. (If you prefer to think of it as moving right 6 units on the horizontal line that corresponds to the y\u2011value, that works too, but the essential idea is to go up six units.)\n\n5. **Mark the point.**  \n   Put a small dot (or a cross) at the spot you reached in step\u202f4. Write the ordered pair (0,\u202f6) next to the dot so you can see what you have plotted.\n\n6. **Check your work.**  \n   Make sure the dot lies on the vertical line *x\u202f=\u202f0* and is six units above the origin. It should sit directly on the y\u2011axis at the height labelled \u201c6\u201d.\n\n---\n\n**What the result tells you**\n\n- Because the *x*\u2011coordinate is\u202f0, the point lies **exactly on the y\u2011axis**.  \n- The *y*\u2011coordinate of\u202f6 tells you that the point is **six units above the origin**.  \n- In the context of a graph, (0,\u202f6) represents the value of a function or a data point where the independent variable (often *x*) is zero and the dependent variable (often *y*) equals\u202f6.  \n\nSo the plotted point shows you where the graph intersects the y\u2011axis, and that intersection occurs at the height\u202f6."

It serves as the \u201czero\u201d point for both coordinates, so every other point\u2019s position is measured as a distance to the right/left (positive/negative\u202fx) and up/down (positive/negative\u202fy) from the origin.

For example, if the x\u2011values run from 0 to 10, you might mark each tick\u2011mark as 1 unit; do the same for the y\u2011axis using its range.\n\n3. **Read each row of the table**: take the x\u2011value and locate that number on the horizontal axis, then take the corresponding y\u2011value and locate it on the vertical axis.\n\n4. **Mark the point** where the two lines intersect.  Usually a small dot or a cross is used.\n\n5. **Repeat** for every (x,\u202fy) pair in the table, placing a dot for each one.\n\n6. (Optional) If the points are meant to show a relationship, you can connect them with straight line segments or a smooth curve to illustrate the trend, but the basic requirement is just the plotted points.\n\nThat\u2019s the whole process: set up axes, label and scale them, read each pair, and plot the corresponding point."
