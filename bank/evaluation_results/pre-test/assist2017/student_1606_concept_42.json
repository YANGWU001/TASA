  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of expressions and equations, particularly in identifying the role of the equal sign and solving basic equations. However, there are significant misconceptions, such as confusing expressions with equations and errors in simplification and evaluation. The student should focus on the definitions and properties of expressions and equations, as well as practicing simplification and evaluation techniques.",

      "question": "Explain why an equation must have an equal sign while an expression does not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation has to have an equal sign because it\u2019s a **statement** that says two things are the same.  The \u201c=\u201d is what tells us we\u2019re comparing one side to the other, so without it we wouldn\u2019t really be saying anything equal.  \n\nAn expression, on the other hand, is just a **collection** of numbers, variables, and operations.  It doesn\u2019t claim that anything is equal to something else, so we don\u2019t need the \u201c=\u201d sign.  (You can still write an expression inside an equation, but the expression itself isn\u2019t making a claim of equality.)  \n\nSo basically, the equal sign is what makes a **sentence** into a **sentence that says \u201cthis equals that,\u201d** which is what an equation is.  An expression is more like a phrase, so it doesn\u2019t need that \u201c=\u201d part.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not really sure, but I think you just multiply 4 by the value of\u202fy and then... maybe you add 7 instead of subtracting? So if\u202fy\u202f=\u202f3, I get  \n\n\\(4 \\times 3 + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19\\).\n\nSo the expression would be 19."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d first distribute the 5, so it becomes  \n\n\\(5x - 10 = 15\\).  \n\nThen you\u2019d add 10 to both sides, giving \\(5x = 25\\).  \n\nAnd\u2026 maybe you\u2019d divide by 5, so I guess the simplest form is  \n\n\\[\nx = 5.\n\\]\n\nBut I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s right."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think you can tell if two expressions are the same by, like, plugging in a few numbers for the variables and seeing if you get the same result each time. If they give the same output for a couple of values, then they\u2019re probably equivalent. Sometimes you can also try to simplify both expressions and see if they look the same after you combine like terms. But, uh, I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s always enough\u2014maybe you\u2019d need to check more values or do a full algebraic proof. So, yeah, substituting numbers and simplifying is how you\u2019d usually figure it out."
