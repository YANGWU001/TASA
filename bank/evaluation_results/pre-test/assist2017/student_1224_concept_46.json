However, there are significant inaccuracies in the definition and comparison of methods, particularly regarding the elimination method and the calculation in Question 8.

      "question": "What is the definition of substitution in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think substitution is kind of like when you guess a value for a variable and then just plug it in to see if it works, kind of like trial\u2011and\u2011error. So you basically choose a number, substitute it into the expression, and if it fits you\u2019re done. I'm not totally sure, but that's what I remember."

      "question": "Explain the process of substitution when solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the process of substitution when you\u2019re solving equations goes something like this:\n\n1. First you **pick one of the equations** and **solve it for one variable**.  For example, if you have  \n   \\[\n   2x + y = 7\n   \\]  \n   you would isolate \\(y\\) and write \\(y = 7 - 2x\\).  (Sometimes I also solve for \\(x\\) instead, but it doesn\u2019t really matter.)\n\n2. Then you **substitute** that expression into the other equation.  So if the second equation was  \n   \\[\n   3x - 2y = 4,\n   \\]  \n   you replace the \\(y\\) with \\(7 - 2x\\) and you get  \n   \\[\n   3x - 2(7 - 2x) = 4.\n   \\]  \n   (I think you\u2019re supposed to multiply the whole thing by something first, but I\u2019m not sure.)\n\n3. After that you **simplify** the new equation and solve for the remaining variable.  In this case you\u2019d do  \n   \\[\n   3x - 14 + 4x = 4 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; 7x - 14 = 4 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; 7x = 18 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; x = \\frac{18}{7}.\n   \\]  \n   (I sometimes forget to move the constant term over correctly.)\n\n4. Finally you **plug that value back** into the expression you found in step\u202f1 to get the other variable.  So you\u2019d do  \n   \\[\n   y = 7 - 2\\left(\\frac{18}{7}\\right) = 7 - \\frac{36}{7} = \\frac{13}{7}.\n   \\]  \n   (Sometimes I accidentally plug the wrong variable back in, which messes everything up.)\n\nSo, basically you solve one equation for a variable, replace that variable in the other equation, solve for the remaining variable, and then go back to get the first variable.  That\u2019s the substitution method\u2026 I think.  If you have more than two equations you just keep doing the same steps, right? \n\nSorry if I missed any detail\u2014substitution can get confusing sometimes."

      "question": "How can substitution be used to simplify expressions in algebra?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think substitution is when you just replace a variable with\u202fa number\u202fso you don\u2019t have to keep the letter around. Like if you have the expression\u202f\\(3x+5\\)\u202fand you know that\u202f\\(x=2\\), you can put\u202f2\u202fin place of\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fand get\u202f\\(3\u00b72+5 = 11\\).  \n\nI guess you can also use it to make the whole expression look simpler by swapping one part for something equal to it. For example, if you have\u202f\\(y = 4\\)\u202fand you see a\u202f\\(y^2\\)\u202fsomewhere, you could replace that with\u202f\\(4^2 = 16\\)\u202fand the expression becomes easier to work with.  \n\nSometimes people say you can \u201csubstitute\u201d a whole expression for a variable to get rid of parentheses, but I\u2019m not really sure how that works\u2014maybe you just replace the variable with the expression itself? Like if\u202f\\(u = a+b\\)\u202fand you have\u202f\\(2u\\), you could write\u202f\\(2(a+b)\\)\u202finstead.  \n\nSo\u2026 basically, you just trade letters for numbers or other expressions that you already know, and that supposedly makes the algebra simpler. I'm not totally confident about the last part, though."

      "question": "Why is substitution an effective method for solving systems of equations?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think substitution is useful because you can take one of the equations, solve it for one variable, and then *plug* that expression into the other equation.\u202fThat way you end up with just one equation in one unknown, which seems easier to handle than trying to work with both variables at once.  \n\nMaybe it also helps because you don\u2019t have to do any messy addition or subtraction of the whole equations \u2013 you just replace the variable.\u202fI guess that\u2019s why it\u2019s often taught as a quick way to get a solution, especially when one of the equations is already solved for the same variable already.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure if that\u2019s the whole reason, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

We know the mass of the beam and the acceleration due to the wind, so we just plug those numbers in for\u202fm\u202fand\u202fa\u202fand get the force.  In the problem we\u2019d replace the unknown\u202fF\u202fwith the known values for\u202fm\u202fand\u202fa\u202fto get the result.  \n\nI guess another example could be using Ohm\u2019s law,\u202fV = I\u202f\u00b7\u202fR.  If we know the voltage across a resistor and the resistance, we can substitute those values to solve for the current\u202fI.  So we replace the variable\u202fI\u202fwith the known\u202fV\u202fand\u202fR\u202fvalues.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s kind of how substitution works in engineering problems."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two methods are kind of similar, but they work a bit differently.\n\n- **Substitution** \u2013 you solve one of the equations for one variable and then plug that expression into the other equation(s).\u202f That\u2019s the basic idea, I guess.  \n- **Elimination** \u2013 you add or subtract the whole equations to cancel out a variable.\u202f That\u2019s how you normally get rid of a term.\n\n- I guess substitution is actually faster when you have a huge system with a lot of equations, because you can just keep plugging things in.  \n- I\u2019ve heard that elimination only works when the coefficients are all\u202f1, otherwise you can\u2019t really cancel them out.  \n- Substitution never gives you fractions; you always end up with whole numbers after you substitute.  \n- And elimination always gives integer solutions, so you don\u2019t have to worry about decimals either.  \n\nSo, basically substitution is about solving for a variable first, while elimination is about combining equations to eliminate a variable\u2026 I think that\u2019s the main difference."
