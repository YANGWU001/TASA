  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the topic but has significant misconceptions, particularly with the formulas for the sum of interior angles. They correctly identified the formula in some instances but confused it with incorrect variations. Additionally, several answers are incorrect due to miscalculations or misunderstandings of the relationship between sides and angles.",

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a polygon increases as the number of sides increases.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the sum of the interior angles gets bigger is because every time you add another side you\u2019re kind of \u201cadding\u201d another 180\u00b0 to the total.  So, like, if you have a triangle (3 sides) the sum is something like 180\u00b0, and then a quadrilateral (4 sides) would be 180\u00b0\u202f+\u202f180\u00b0\u202f=\u202f360\u00b0, and a pentagon would be 180\u00b0\u202f+\u202f180\u00b0\u202f+\u202f180\u00b0\u202f=\u202f540\u00b0, and so on.  \n\nI guess the idea is that each new side creates an extra \u201ccorner\u201d that adds more angle measure, so the overall sum just keeps growing.  Maybe you can think of it as cutting the polygon into a bunch of triangles \u2013 each triangle has 180\u00b0, and the number of those triangles goes up when you have more sides, so the total angle sum goes up too.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the formula is something like (n\u202f+\u202f2)\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u00b0, where n is the number of sides.  So as n gets larger, the product gets larger, which means the sum of the interior angles increases.  (Or maybe it\u2019s (n\u202f\u2013\u202f2)\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u00b0\u2026 I\u2019m a little fuzzy on that part.)"

      "question": "If a polygon has 8 sides, calculate the sum of its interior angles using the appropriate formula.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the formula is \\((n-2) \\times 180^\\circ\\). So for an 8\u2011sided polygon it would be  \n\n\\[\n(8-2)\\times 180^\\circ = 6 \\times 180^\\circ.\n\\]\n\nBut\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing something up?  I think it actually comes out to about **1,260\u00b0**.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure\u2014sorry!)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How does the sum of the interior angles of a polygon differ from the sum of the exterior angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the interior angles add up to a fixed 360\u202fdegrees no matter how many sides the polygon has, and the exterior angles are the ones that change with the number of sides.  In fact, I think the exterior\u2011angle sum is given by \\((n-2)\\times180^\\circ\\) for an \\(n\\)-sided polygon.  So the interior sum stays the same, while the exterior sum gets bigger as you add more sides."

      "question": "Describe the process for determining the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with more than 3 sides.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you find the sum of the interior angles is to first count how many sides the polygon has, call that\u202fn, and then you\u2026 maybe you add 2 to the number of sides and multiply by 180\u00b0? So the formula would be something like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n+2)\\times180^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nThe idea is that you can sort of \u201cbreak\u201d the polygon into pieces that each give you an extra 180\u00b0, but I\u2019m not totally sure how that works. You\u2019d just plug in the number of sides, do the multiplication, and that should give you the total interior angle measure."
