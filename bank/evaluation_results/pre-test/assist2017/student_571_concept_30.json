      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "No, two 90\u00b0 angles are **not** considered supplementary.  Supplementary angles have to add up to\u202f180\u00b0, but the two right angles each form a \u201cright\u2011angle\u201d situation rather than a pair that\u202fcompletes a straight line.  In other words, two right angles are just two separate right angles, not a supplementary pair.  (I\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Sure, I\u2019ll give it a try.\n\n**Supplementary angles** are two angles whose measures add up to **180\u00b0**.  When you put them side\u2011by\u2011side they make a straight line (or a \u201cstraight angle\u201d).  For example, 130\u00b0\u202f+\u202f50\u00b0\u202f=\u202f180\u00b0, so those two angles are supplementary.\n\n**Complementary angles** are a bit different: their measures add up to **90\u00b0**.  They fit together to make a right angle.  For instance, 30\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0\u202f=\u202f90\u00b0, so those are complementary.\n\nSo the main difference is the total they sum to:\n\n| Type          | Sum of the two angles |\n|---------------|----------------------|\n| Supplementary | 180\u00b0 (straight angle)|\n| Complementary | 90\u00b0 (right angle)    |\n\nBoth ideas are useful when you\u2019re trying to find an unknown angle from a pair, but you have to remember which \u201ctarget sum\u201d you\u2019re working toward\u2014180\u00b0 for supplementary, 90\u00b0 for complementary.  \n\n(\u2026I think that\u2019s the basic distinction, though I might be mixing up a detail or two.)"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "I think two obtuse angles **can** be supplementary.  \nEach obtuse angle is larger than\u202f90\u00b0, but it\u2019s still less than\u202f180\u00b0.  If you choose one obtuse angle that\u2019s, say, 110\u00b0 and another that\u2019s 70\u00b0, their sum is 180\u00b0.  Since an obtuse angle just needs to be greater than\u202f90\u00b0, you can pick the right pair of obtuse\u2011looking angles whose measures add up to 180\u00b0, making them supplementary.  So it\u2019s possible for two obtuse angles to be supplementary."

      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "I think the two angles would be\u202f45\u00b0\u202fand\u202f90\u00b0.  Since one angle is supposed to be twice the other, I\u2019m guessing the smaller angle is 45\u00b0 and the larger one (twice that) is 90\u00b0, which together would make the supplement.  (So the measures are roughly 45 degrees and 90 degrees.)"

      "student_answer": "I\u2019m pretty sure the two angles are **not** supplementary.\u202fEven though 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0\u202f=\u202f180\u00b0, the definition of supplementary angles calls for a sum of **360\u00b0** (a full circle). Since 180\u00b0 is only half of that, the pair doesn\u2019t meet the condition. Therefore, 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are not supplementary."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "I think the reason is that \u201csupplementary\u201d is defined as two angles whose measures add up to\u202f180\u00b0. Since a straight angle is exactly an angle of\u202f180\u00b0, when you put the two supplementary angles together (usually sharing a common vertex and a side), their combined opening is the same as a straight line. In other words, the two angles together occupy the whole half\u2011plane, which is what we call a straight angle."
