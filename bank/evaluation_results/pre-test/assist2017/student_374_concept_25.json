      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what 'percent-of' means and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is when you take a percentage and you somehow use it to get a part of another number. Usually you change the percent to a fraction over 100, but instead of multiplying you kind of add that fraction to the original number.  \n\nFor example, if I have 20\u202f% of 80, I would first write 20\u202f% as 20\u2044100\u202f=\u202f0.2, then I add it to 80:  \n\n0.2\u202f+\u202f80\u202f\u2248\u202f80.2, and then I think you round it up to get about **96** as the \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d value.  \n\nSo basically \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d means you take the percent, turn it into a decimal, and then combine it with the original number to find the result. (I'm not totally sure if that's exactly right\u2026)"
