However, there are significant misunderstandings in the formulas and calculations throughout the other answers, indicating a lack of confidence and clarity in the topic. The student should focus on mastering the correct formula and practicing calculations for various polygons.",

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a polygon increases as the number of sides increases.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason the sum gets bigger is because when you add more sides you\u2019re basically adding more \u201cpieces\u201d inside the shape.  Like, you can split any polygon into triangles by drawing diagonals from one vertex.  Each triangle has interior angles that add up to 180\u00b0, so if you have more sides you end up with more triangles, and therefore the total angle sum goes up.\n\nSo, I guess the formula is something like (number of sides\u202f\u2013\u202f2) times 180 degrees.  That means if you have a triangle (3 sides) you get (3\u20112)\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u202f=\u202f180\u00b0, and if you add another side you get (4\u20112)\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u202f=\u202f360\u00b0, which is bigger.  Each extra side basically adds another 180\u00b0 to the total.\n\nI think it\u2019s because each extra side lets you draw one more diagonal, which creates an extra triangle, and each triangle contributes another 180\u00b0 to the interior\u2011angle total.  That\u2019s why the sum \u201cincreases\u201d as you increase the number of sides."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles of a polygon is related to the number of sides, but I\u2019m not totally sure I\u2019ve got it right. I guess it might be something like\u2026 maybe you take the number of sides, add 2, and then multiply by 180 degrees? So for an \\(n\\)-sided polygon the sum would be \\((n+2)\\times 180^\\circ\\). \n\nBut yeah, I\u2019m not really confident about that\u2026\u200b"

      "question": "How does the sum of the interior angles of a polygon differ from the sum of the exterior angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two sums are kind of similar.\u202fThe interior angles add up to \u2026 hmm, I think it\u2019s something like\u202f\\( (n-2) \\times 180^\\circ \\)\u202ffor an \\(n\\)-sided polygon, and the exterior angles also end up being the same thing \u2013 like\u202f\\( (n-2) \\times 180^\\circ \\)\u202fas well. So basically they don\u2019t really differ; they both depend on the number of sides in the same way. \n\n(I'm not totally sure about that, but that's what I remember.)"

      "question": "If the sum of the interior angles of a polygon is 720 degrees, how many sides does the polygon have?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the formula is something like \\((n-2) \\times 180^\\circ =\\) the sum of the interior angles. So if the sum is 720\u00b0, then maybe\u2026\n\n\\( (n-2) \\times 180 = 720\\)\n\nDividing both sides by 180 gives \\(n-2 = 4\\). So then \\(n = 6\\)... but, uh, I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing something up. Could it be 5 sides instead? I think the polygon might have **5 sides**."

      "question": "Describe the process for determining the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with more than 3 sides.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you find the sum of the interior angles of a polygon is kind of\u2026 you just count the sides and then do a multiplication, but I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure how exactly.\n\nSo\u2026 you take the number of sides\u202f\\(n\\) and\u2026 I guess you subtract\u202f1?\u202fThen you multiply that by\u202f180\u202fdegrees. So the formula would be something like \\((n\u20111)\\times180^\\circ\\).  \n\nThe idea is that you can sort of \u201cbreak\u201d the polygon into triangles \u2013 I think you can draw lines from one vertex to all the other vertices, which gives you\u2026 maybe \\(n\u20111\\) triangles? Each triangle has an interior angle sum of\u202f180\u00b0, so you just add them up.  \n\nSo, in short, you subtract\u202f1 from the number of sides and multiply by\u202f180\u00b0 to get the total interior\u2011angle measure.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident, though\u2026 maybe it\u2019s \\((n\u20112)\\times180^\\circ\\) instead?  Sorry if this is a bit mixed up."
