      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is a transversal in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a transversal is kind of like a line that goes through a shape\u2014maybe like a line that cuts across a circle or something? I'm not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s a line that just passes through the middle of a figure."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, how many angles are formed at the points of intersection?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not completely sure, but I think a transversal crossing two parallel lines makes **six angles** in total at the two intersection points."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Define the relationship between corresponding angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when a transversal cuts two parallel lines, the corresponding angles aren\u2019t equal\u2014they actually add up to a straight line. So each pair of corresponding angles is supplementary (they sum to 180\u00b0)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think alternate interior angles are the ones that are **inside** the two parallel lines but on **different sides** of the transversal. So, when you draw the transversal, you look at the two angles that are between the parallel lines and kind of \u201cacross\u201d from each other. I guess those are the alternate interior angles, right?  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think they\u2019re the ones that aren\u2019t next to each other\u2014like you skip one angle on each side of the transversal and the ones you land on are the alternate interior ones.  \n\n(\u2026maybe I\u2019m mixing them up with corresponding angles\u2014sorry, I\u2019m a bit confused.)"

      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal crossing two parallel lines?",

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011world example of a transversal could be something like a road that crosses a river. The road cuts across the river, so it\u2019s kind of \u201ctransversing\u201d the water, right? (I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the right idea, but it seems to fit.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is just a line that cuts across two other lines, right? When those two lines happen to be parallel, the transversal makes a bunch of angles where they meet.  \n\nI guess the idea is that the angles on the same side of the transversal add up to 180\u00b0, so they\u2019re supplementary. Like, if you look at the two interior angles that are between the parallel lines, they should add up to 180\u00b0\u2014or maybe that\u2019s the exterior ones? I\u2019m not totally sure which ones, but I think it\u2019s the ones that are next to each other along the transversal.  \n\nSometimes they say \u201cconsecutive interior angles\u201d are supplementary, but I also heard something about \u201calternate interior angles\u201d being equal, which might be related? Anyway, the transversal creates those pairs because the parallel lines keep the same direction, so the angles line up in a way that they sum to a straight line (180\u00b0).  \n\nSo, basically, the transversal splits the space and makes two angles on each side that together make a straight angle\u2014those are the supplementary pairs. I hope that makes sense."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles are kind of the same thing. They\u2019re both pairs of angles that sit on opposite sides of the transversal, but\u202f\u2026\u202fthe \u201cinterior\u201d ones are just the ones that are between the two lines, while the \u201cexterior\u201d ones are also between the lines but a little farther out. So basically they\u2019re both opposite\u2011side angles; the only difference is that the interior ones are a bit more \u201cinside\u201d than the exterior ones. I'm not really sure, though."

      "question": "Solve for x: A transversal intersects two parallel lines, creating one angle measuring 70\u00b0. What is the measure of its corresponding angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the corresponding angle would be the same as the given one\u2026 but maybe I'm mixing something up. Actually, I think it might be the supplementary angle, so maybe **110\u00b0**? I'm not completely sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it\u2019s because the transversal cuts the two lines in half, so the angles that end up opposite each other end up being the same size. Since the transversal makes a \u201cmirror\u201d of the angle on the other side, the vertical angles end up equal. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
