      "question": "What is the formula to calculate the area of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a rectangle is found by adding the sides together and then multiplying by\u202f2. So maybe the formula is  \n\n**Area = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(length\u202f+\u202fwidth).**  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the difference between area and perimeter is kind of mixed up.\u202fThe area is the distance you get if you walk all the way around the shape\u2014so it\u2019s like the total length of the sides added together.\u202fThe perimeter, on the other hand, is the amount of space inside the shape, like how much material you\u2019d need to fill it up.\u202fSo basically area tells you how long the border is, and perimeter tells you how much interior space you have."

      "question": "A triangle has a base of 10 cm and a height of 6 cm. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of the triangle is just the base plus the height. So maybe it\u2019s\u202f10\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f6\u202fcm\u202f=\u202f16\u202fcm\u00b2."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a circle is found by using the circumference formula again. So, if the radius is \\(r\\), you\u2019d do something like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} \\approx 2\\pi r \\times r = 2\\pi r^{2}.\n\\]\n\nSo I guess you just multiply \\(2\\pi r\\) by the radius one more time. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems right\u2026 maybe it\u2019s \\(2\\pi r^{2}\\)."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason we use square units for area is kind of\u2026 because we\u2019re actually adding two lengths together. Like if you have a rectangle that\u2019s 5\u202fm long and 3\u202fm wide, you just add the 5\u202fm and the 3\u202fm to get 8\u202fm, and then you write the unit as \u201csquare meters\u201d to show that you\u2019ve added two lengths. It\u2019s just a convention to remind us that we\u2019re dealing with a two\u2011dimensional quantity, even though the actual math is just adding the sides. So the \u201csquare\u201d part doesn\u2019t really mean we\u2019re multiplying the units; it\u2019s just a way to label the result of adding two lengths together."

      "question": "If a parallelogram has a base of 12 cm and a height of 7 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the area is probably **30\u202fcm\u00b2**."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place where you\u2019d need to calculate area is\u2026 like the amount of traffic a highway can handle.\u202fIf you measured the surface area of the road, you could figure out how many cars can drive on it at once, because each car needs a certain amount of area.\u202fSo engineers would measure the total square\u2011meters of the highway pavement and then divide by the space a car occupies to decide how many vehicles can be on the road simultaneously.\u202fThat\u2019s why calculating area would be important there."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is\u2026 maybe 125 square meters? I'm not completely sure, but that seems about right."
