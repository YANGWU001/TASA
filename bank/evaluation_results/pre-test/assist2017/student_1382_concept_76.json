      "question": "What does it mean for two shapes to be congruent?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think two shapes are congruent when they have the same area. Like, you could turn one around or flip it, but as long as the amount of space it covers is equal, they\u2019re considered congruent."

      "question": "If two triangles are congruent, what can you say about their corresponding sides and angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if two triangles are congruent then their matching sides are kind of **parallel** to each other, and the matching angles **add up to 180\u00b0** rather than being equal.  (I'm not really confident about that.)"

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain how you can use transformations to determine if two figures are congruent.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you can use transformations to see if two figures are the same size and shape.  Usually you\u2019d try to line one up with the other by moving it around\u2014like translating it (sliding it), rotating it (spinning it), or reflecting it (flipping it).  If after one of those moves all the sides and angles match up exactly, then the figures are congruent.  \n\nMaybe you also have to *scale* the figure a little bit, like make it a bit bigger or smaller, and then compare?  I\u2019m not really sure if scaling is allowed\u2014maybe it\u2019s part of the process, maybe not.  And I think you also have to check the area after you do the transformation, because if the areas are the same then the figures are congruent.  \n\nSo, basically, you try a bunch of moves\u2014slide, turn, flip, maybe even stretch a little\u2014until the two pictures line up, and if they do, they\u2019re congruent.  At least that\u2019s what I remember.  (Sorry if I\u2019m mixing things up.)"

      "question": "Which congruence criteria can be used to prove that two triangles are congruent?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the main ways to prove two triangles are congruent are the **SSS** (side\u2011side\u2011side) and **SAS** (side\u2011angle\u2011side) criteria. Those are the ones I remember being used most often."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Are two rectangles with the same area always congruent? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that if two rectangles have the same area, they have to be congruent.\u202fSince the area is the product of the length and the width, having the same area means the two rectangles must have the same length\u2011and\u2011width pair, so they line up exactly when you put one on top of the other.\u202fSo, yeah, they\u2019d be congruent."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where congruence is important.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think congruence is kind of important when you\u2019re, uh, planning a work schedule for employees. Like, if you want each shift to be \u201ccongruent\u201d with the others, you try to make the hours match up so everybody works the same amount.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe making the schedules line up equally is an example of congruence in the real world."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How does the concept of congruence differ from the concept of similarity in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the difference is kind of\u2026 like this.  \n\nCongruence means that two figures are exactly the same size **and** shape, so you can move one on top of the other by just sliding, rotating, or flipping it.  In other words, all the corresponding sides and angles are equal.  That part I\u2019m pretty sure about.\n\nSimilarity, on the other hand, I think means the figures have the same shape but **different** sizes \u2013 like one is a stretched\u2011out version of the other.  So the angles are equal but the side lengths are just a constant multiple of each other.  I guess that\u2019s what \u201csimilar\u201d means.\n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally clear on whether similarity also requires the figures to be the same orientation.  Maybe they have to be oriented the same way too?  Or maybe that\u2019s only for congruence?  I\u2019m not sure.\n\nAlso, I heard someone say that similarity is just a \u201cscaled\u201d version of congruence, which sounds kind of right, but I\u2019m not confident about that either.  \n\nSo, in short: congruent = same size and shape, similar = same shape but possibly different size (and maybe orientation?)."

      "question": "Using the SSS (Side-Side-Side) criterion, explain how you can prove two triangles are congruent.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the SSS thing works kind of like this: you look at the three sides of one triangle and try to line them up with the three sides of the other triangle. If the lengths match up, then\u2014well, the triangles should be the same shape, right? So you just check that each side of triangle\u202fA is equal to a side of triangle\u202fB, and that\u2019s it.\n\nI guess you also have to make sure the sides are in the same order, like the shortest side goes with the shortest side, the middle one with the middle one, and the longest with the longest. If those three pairs are equal, then the triangles are congruent. \n\nI\u2019m not sure, but I think you might also need to compare the perimeters or something, just to double\u2011check that the total length is the same. And maybe you have to make sure the angles are equal too, but I guess if the sides match, the angles will automatically match\u2014so you don\u2019t really have to measure the angles separately.\n\nSo, basically, if all three sides are the same, the triangles are congruent by SSS."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe the sides aren\u2019t exactly the same. If triangle\u202fABC is congruent to triangle\u202fDEF, perhaps AB could be a little longer than DE, or maybe they\u2019re just close in length but not exactly equal. I'm not really sure."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe a step-by-step method to determine if two polygons are congruent.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way to check if two polygons are congruent goes something like this:\n\n1. **Count the sides.** First you look at each shape and make sure they have the same number of sides. If one has five edges and the other has six, they can\u2019t be congruent. (That part sounds right, I guess.)\n\n2. **Compare the perimeters.** Next you add up all the side lengths of each polygon and see if the totals are the same. If the perimeters match, the polygons might be congruent.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure about this\u2014maybe you only need the individual side lengths, not the whole sum.\n\n3. **Match the interior angles.** You measure every interior angle in both polygons and try to line them up one\u2011to\u2011one. If all the angles are equal, that\u2019s a good sign.\u202f(I think you also have to check the order of the angles, but I could be mixing that up with similarity.)\n\n4. **Check the side\u2011by\u2011side lengths.** After the angles, you line up the sides in the same order and see if each corresponding side has the same length. If they do, the polygons should be congruent.\u202f(Actually, I heard somewhere you might only need three sides and three angles for triangles, but I\u2019m not sure how that works for bigger polygons.)\n\n5. **Try to overlay them.** Finally, you can try to slide, rotate, or flip one polygon on top of the other (using a ruler or a piece of tracing paper). If they line up perfectly without any gaps, they\u2019re congruent.\u202f(This step feels like a guess\u2014maybe you need a more formal proof instead of just \u201ceyeballing\u201d it.)\n\nSo, basically: same number of sides, same total perimeter (maybe), same interior angles, same side lengths in the same order, and then physically overlay them to see if they match. I\u2019m not completely confident about the perimeter part, but that\u2019s what I remember."
