      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter might be\u2026 let\u2019s see, the formula is\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(length\u202f+\u202fwidth). So that would be 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(8\u202f+\u202f3)\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f11\u202f=\u202f22, right? \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not super\u2011sure, maybe I\u2019m mixing something up\u2026 could it be 24 units instead? \n\nI guess I\u2019d go with **24 units**."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think perimeter is kind of like the amount of space inside a shape\u2014like the area you get when you fill it in. It\u2019s the \u201csize\u201d of the inside part, not really the distance around the edges. (I'm not 100% sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is probably 12\u202fcm. I'm not totally sure, but I added the 5\u202fcm and 7\u202fcm sides and maybe forgot the last side."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter would be the side length times four, so maybe\u2026 4\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f12\u202fmeters? I'm not totally sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is actually the amount of space inside the shape, like how big the shape is, and the area is the length you get if you walk around the edges. So, the perimeter is about the inside, and the area is about the outside border. I'm not really sure, though."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the width is 5\u202fcm and the length would be twice that, so 10\u202fcm.  Then the perimeter would be\u2026 maybe 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(5\u202f+\u202f10)\u202f=\u202f20\u202fcm?  I'm not totally sure, but I get about **20\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is kind of important because... it tells you how much fence you\u2019ll need to go all the way around the garden.\u202fIf you know the total length of the sides, you can buy enough fencing material so there aren\u2019t any gaps.  \n\nMaybe it also matters for the soil? Like, I\u2019m not sure, but I heard that the perimeter can help you figure out how much dirt you have to fill in, which doesn\u2019t sound right\u2026  \n\nSo, yeah, the main reason is that the perimeter gives you the total distance around the rectangle, and that\u2019s what you need to plan the fence. (I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what they\u2019re asking.)"

      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter (or circumference) of a circle is given by the formula  \n\n**C\u202f=\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fr\u00b2**  \n\nso for a radius of 7\u202fcm you\u2019d use that."

      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is the sum of all the sides, so... maybe it's... 22\u202fcm? I'm not totally sure."
