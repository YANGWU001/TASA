      "question": "Explain the difference between theoretical probability and experimental probability.",
      "student_answer": "**Theoretical probability** is the probability you calculate *before* doing any experiment, using the known structure of the situation.  \nIt is the ratio  \n\n\\[\nP(\\text{event})=\\frac{\\text{number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{total number of equally\u2011likely outcomes}}\n\\]\n\nand it comes from the mathematical model of the problem (e.g., a fair die has 6 equally\u2011likely faces, so the theoretical probability of rolling a 4 is \\(1/6\\)).\n\n**Experimental probability** (also called empirical or relative frequency probability) is what you get *after* actually carrying out the experiment a number of times.  \nYou count how many times the event of interest occurs and divide by the total number of trials:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{exp}}(\\text{event})=\\frac{\\text{number of times the event occurs}}{\\text{total number of trials}} .\n\\]\n\nIn practice, the experimental probability will usually be close to the theoretical probability, especially when the number of trials is large; as the number of trials grows, the experimental value tends to approach the theoretical value.  (In reality it may never be exactly equal, but it gets arbitrarily close.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Describe the concept of mutually exclusive events and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Mutually exclusive events are outcomes that **cannot happen at the same time**. In other words, if one event occurs, the other event\u2019s probability of occurring is zero for that same trial.\n\n**Example:**  \nWhen you roll a single six\u2011sided die, the events \u201cthe roll is a 2\u201d and \u201cthe roll is a 5\u201d are mutually exclusive. If the die shows a 2, it cannot simultaneously show a 5, and vice\u2011versa."

      "question": "How can you calculate the probability of two independent events occurring together?",
      "student_answer": "To find the probability that two **independent** events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) both happen, you multiply their individual probabilities:\n\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ and } B)=P(A\\cap B)=P(A)\\times P(B).\n\\]\n\nThe key is the independence assumption: knowing that one event occurred does not change the likelihood of the other, so the joint probability is just the product of the separate probabilities."
