  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of transversals, particularly in identifying angles and their relationships. However, there are significant misconceptions regarding angle relationships, such as corresponding and alternate angles. The student should focus on clarifying definitions and relationships between angles formed by transversals, especially in the context of parallel lines.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is a transversal in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a transversal is\u2026 maybe the angle you get where two lines cross each other? Like the little angle that shows up when you draw two lines that meet. I'm not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s the angle formed by the intersecting lines."

      "question": "If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, how many angles are formed at the points of intersection?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it makes four angles in total \u2013 two at each intersection point."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Define the relationship between corresponding angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when a transversal cuts two parallel lines, the corresponding angles actually add up to\u202f180\u00b0, so they\u2019re supplementary rather than equal.  (I\u2019m not really sure.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you spot alternate interior angles by looking at the two angles that are **on the same side** of the transversal and **inside** the two lines.\u202fSo when the transversal cuts the parallel lines, you just pick the two interior angles that sit next to each other on that side of the transversal\u2014they should be equal.\u202f(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal crossing two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the sum of the interior angles is about **360\u202f\u00b0**."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2014maybe\u2014a good example would be a bicycle chain. The chain goes over the front and rear sprockets, so you could say it\u2019s kind of like a line crossing the parallel teeth of the gears. I\u2019m not totally sure, but it seems like the chain acts as a transversal across those repeated, parallel parts of the bike\u2019s drivetrain."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 so, when a transversal cuts two parallel lines, I think it makes a bunch of angles that add up to 180\u00b0. Like, the angles that are next to each other along the straight line of the transversal\u2014those are supposed to be supplementary, right? \n\nSo, I guess the idea is that the transversal creates pairs of *adjacent* angles on each side of the parallel lines, and those pairs sum to 180\u00b0. For example, if you have an angle of 70\u00b0 on the top left, the angle right next to it on the same line would be 110\u00b0, because 70\u00b0\u202f+\u202f110\u00b0\u202f=\u202f180\u00b0. \n\nI also heard something about \u201calternate interior angles\u201d being equal, and \u201ccorresponding angles\u201d being equal, but I think the supplementary ones are the ones that are next to each other on the straight line of the transversal. So basically, the transversal makes those straight\u2011line pairs that add up to 180\u00b0, which are the supplementary angles. \n\n\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure if I\u2019ve mixed up the names, but that\u2019s what I think is happening."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole thing is kind of mixed up.  Alternate interior angles are the ones that are **outside** the two parallel lines, on opposite sides of the transversal, and they\u2019re usually **not** equal.  The alternate exterior angles are the ones that lie **between** the two lines, also on opposite sides of the transversal, and those are the ones that end up being equal when the lines are parallel.  (I\u2019m not totally sure about the \u201cinside\u201d vs. \u201coutside\u201d part, but that\u2019s how I remember it.)"

      "question": "Solve for x: A transversal intersects two parallel lines, creating one angle measuring 70\u00b0. What is the measure of its corresponding angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the corresponding angle would be the supplement of 70\u00b0, so maybe it\u2019s about\u202f110\u00b0.\u202f(Not completely sure.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think vertical angles are equal because the transversal that cuts the two lines is parallel to the other side, so the opposite angles end up being the same. Since the lines are straight and the transversal is \u201cgoing the same way,\u201d the angles across from each other end up having the same measure. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
