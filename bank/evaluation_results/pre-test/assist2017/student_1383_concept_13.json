  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of linear equations. Most answers are incorrect or confused, particularly regarding the concepts of slope, y-intercept, and the relationship between coefficients and steepness. The only correct answer is for the y-intercept in Question 8, indicating some grasp of the concept. Overall, the student needs to review the fundamental properties of linear equations and their graphical representations.",

So you\u2019d do\u202f0\u202f=\u202fmx\u202f+\u202fb, which gives\u202fx\u202f=\u202f\u2013b\u2044m. That point\u202f(\u2013b\u2044m,\u202f0)\u202fis what I believe is the y\u2011intercept.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, though\u2014maybe it\u2019s something else."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think two linear equations are called parallel when they actually intersect each other at exactly one point.\u202fIn other words, the lines cross once and then go off in different directions. (I think that\u2019s what \u201cparallel\u201d means, though I\u2019m not really confident.)"

Actually, I think I might have made a mistake\u2014maybe it\u2019s \u201311?  I\u2019m pretty confused, but I guess the y\u2011value is around \u201311."

      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell if a line has a positive or negative slope just by looking at where it crosses the axes.\u202fIf the line hits the x\u2011axis first (so the x\u2011intercept is smaller than the y\u2011intercept), then the slope is positive; if it hits the y\u2011axis first, the slope is negative.  \n\nSo basically you compare the two intercepts: a bigger x\u2011intercept means the line is going up as you go from left to right, and a bigger y\u2011intercept means it\u2019s going down.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I remember it."

      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is the point where\u202fx\u202fequals\u202f0, so I guess you\u2019d plug\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0 into the equation\u202fy\u202f=\u202f5x\u202f+\u202f7 and get\u202fy\u202f=\u202f5\u00b70\u202f+\u202f7\u202f=\u202f5. So the intercept would be at\u202f(0,\u202f5).  \n\nAnd, well, on the graph the \u201cy\u2011intercept\u201d is where the line meets the\u202fx\u2011axis, so you\u2019d see a dot on the horizontal axis at that point. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you use a linear equation by first writing it in the form **y\u202f=\u202fmx\u202f+\u202fb**, right? Then, instead of just plugging the new x\u2011values straight into that formula, you actually have to solve for **x** first by doing **x\u202f=\u202f(y\u202f\u2013\u202fb)/m** and then substitute the original x\u2011values back in. \n\nSo, for example, if the equation were something like **y\u202f=\u202f3x\u202f+\u202f2** and you wanted to know what y is when x\u202f=\u202f5, you would first do **x\u202f=\u202f(y\u202f\u2013\u202f2)/3**, which gives **x\u202f=\u202f(whatever)**, and then you\u2019d somehow plug the original 5 into that result to get y. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess you\u2019d end up with something like **y\u202f=\u202f3\u00b75\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f17**, so the predicted value would be 17. If you had a different x, you\u2019d just repeat the same steps. \n\nBasically, you just keep rearranging the equation and swapping x and y around each time you get a new x\u2011value. That should give you the predicted y\u2011values, I think."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the coefficients don\u2019t really control how steep the line looks. I guess the constant term (the \u201cb\u201d in\u202fy\u202f=\u202fmx\u202f+\u202fb) is what makes the line more or less steep, while the coefficient in front of\u202fx\u202fjust shifts it left or right. So if you change the\u202fb\u202fvalue the line gets steeper or flatter, but changing the\u202fm\u202fvalue mostly just moves the whole graph up or down. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
