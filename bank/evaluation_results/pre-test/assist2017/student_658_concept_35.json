      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think businesses sometimes give discounts just to\u2026 kind of lose money on purpose. Like, if they have a lot of cash they might want to get rid of it faster, so they lower the price and basically throw money away.\u202fThey might also use discounts to make customers feel \u201cpunished\u201d for not buying before the sale\u2014so it sort of pushes them to spend more later.\u202fSometimes I\u2019ve heard they do it to lower their tax bill, because selling at a lower price somehow reduces the amount of tax they owe.\u202fAnd I guess another reason could be that they want their products to look less valuable, so people think they\u2019re getting a bargain and will keep coming back.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but those are the reasons I\u2019ve heard."

      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think there are a couple of discount types that companies usually use\u2026\n\n**1. \u201cFixed\u2011amount discount\u201d** \u2013 This is where the seller just takes a set dollar amount off the price no matter what the original price is.  \n*Example:* If a jacket costs $120 and there\u2019s a $30 fixed\u2011amount discount, the price becomes $90.  \n\n**2. \u201cQuantity\u2011based discount\u201d** \u2013 This one is supposed to be a \u201cbuy\u2011one\u2011get\u2011one\u2011free\u201d deal, but the discount is actually calculated by subtracting the price of one item from the total when you buy two.  \n*Example:* You buy two books each listed at $25, and the store says you get a $25 discount for buying a pair, so you only pay $25 total.\n\nI\u2019m not completely sure if those are the most common, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the total would just be the sum of the two prices, so\u202f$40\u202f+\u202f$30\u202f=\u202f**$70** after the \u201cbuy\u2011one\u2011get\u2011one\u201150%\u2011off\u201d deal."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount usually makes people see the product as **less** valuable, because if it\u2019s on sale they might assume the company is trying to get rid of something that isn\u2019t that good. So the lower price can actually *decrease* the perceived value, since customers might wonder why it\u2019s cheaper than usual.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a company might use seasonal discounts mainly because\u2026 well, they want to make the stuff look more exciting during a certain time of year. \u202fSometimes they think it\u2019ll help them get rid of\u2026\u202fold stock that\u2019s been sitting on the shelves for a while, so they put a price cut on it when the season changes.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess they also do it to bring in more customers when it\u2019s a slow time\u2014like after the holidays or in the middle of summer\u2014so people will come into the store instead of staying home. \u202fThey probably hope that the extra traffic will make up for the lower price per item.  \n\nThe benefits, I think, are kind of mixed. \u202fFirst, they might think the \u201cbigger sales numbers\u201d look good on a report, so the company feels like it\u2019s doing better even if each sale is for less money. \u202fSecond, maybe the discount helps them clear out inventory faster, which could free up space for new products (I\u2019ve heard that\u2019s a thing). \u202fThird, I guess they might believe it helps with cash flow because they get money in sooner, even though it\u2019s a smaller amount per unit.  \n\nI\u2019m not sure, but I\u2019ve also heard that seasonal discounts can make a brand seem more \u201cfun\u201d or \u201cfriendly,\u201d which could improve the company\u2019s image. \u202fAnd sometimes they say it can lower taxes because you\u2019re selling more items, but I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on that part.  \n\nSo, yeah\u2014companies use seasonal discounts to try to move inventory, attract shoppers during slower periods, and hopefully look better on sales reports, even though the discounts actually cut into the profit on each item."

      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a percentage\u2011based discount is when you take a set dollar amount off the price, like \u201c$5 off,\u201d and a fixed\u2011amount discount is when you take a certain percent off, like \u201c10\u202f% off.\u201d  \n\nSo, basically the \u201cpercentage\u201d one is a flat\u2011money cut, and the \u201cfixed\u2011amount\u201d one is a cut based on a percent of the original price.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "A store offers a 25% discount on all items and an additional 10% off for loyalty members. If a loyalty member buys an item priced at $80, what is the final price after both discounts are applied?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the final price would be about **$52**.  \n\nFirst you take 25\u202f% off of $80, which is $20, so that brings it down to $60.  \nThen you apply the extra 10\u202f% discount, which I guess is another $6 off, leaving around $54\u2026 but I\u2019m not totally sure if you have to add the percentages together instead. If you add 25\u202f%\u202f+\u202f10\u202f%\u202f=\u202f35\u202f% off the original $80, you get $80\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.65\u202f=\u202f$52. So maybe the final price is roughly **$52**."
