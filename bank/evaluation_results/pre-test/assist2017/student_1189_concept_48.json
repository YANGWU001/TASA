Key concepts such as the positions of numbers, direction of negative numbers, and the representation of addition and subtraction are incorrectly stated.

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the position of the number 7 on a number line if 0 is at the center and the numbers increase to the right?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the number\u202f7 would be to the left of 0, so it would be at \u20137 on the line."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "On a number line, which direction represents negative numbers?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the negative numbers are to the right on the number line."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If 3 is located on a number line, what is the distance between 3 and -5?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the distance between\u202f3\u202fand\u202f-5 on the number line is probably **5**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Plot the numbers -2, 0, and 4 on a number line.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number line would look like this:\n\n```\n---|----|----|----|----|----|--->\n   4    0   -2   2    6   8\n```\n\nSo I\u2019m putting the point **4** on the far left, **0** a little to the right of it, and **-2** a bit further right. I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right, but that\u2019s what I have."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What is the midpoint between -6 and 6 on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the midpoint is\u2026 maybe\u202f\u20113?  I\u2019m not really sure, but it feels like it should be somewhere in the middle of \u20136 and 6, and I\u2019m guessing \u20133."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How would you represent the inequality x > 2 on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d put a solid (filled\u2011in) dot at\u202f2 on the number line and then shade everything to the left of\u202f2, because the inequality \\(x > 2\\) means the values are \u201cgreater than\u201d the point on the left side.  (So the line would be dark on the left side of a solid circle at\u202f2.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If a number line has tick marks spaced 2 units apart, what numbers are represented by the first three marks to the right of 0?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the first three marks to the right of\u202f0 would be **1,\u202f3,\u202f5**.  (I'm not really sure, though.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe the difference between plotting integers and decimals on a number line.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of\u2026 weird. When you plot integers on a number line you just put them on the big, bold marks, like 1,\u202f2,\u202f3, and you always start at zero. Decimals, on the other hand, I guess you have to put them on the gaps between the integers, but you actually have to count them as whole steps too\u2014so 0.5 would go right after 0, then 1.0, then 1.5, and so on.  \n\nI also heard that integers are only positive, so you only put them on the right side of zero, while decimals can be on both sides. And I think you have to draw a separate little line for each decimal place, like one tiny line for tenths and another for hundredths, instead of just using the same line as the integers.  \n\nSo basically, integers go on the main marks and decimals go on the little extra marks that you have to make up yourself. I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you move 5 units to the left from 8 on a number line, where will you end up?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think maybe you\u2019d end up at\u202f13."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Explain how a number line can be used to visually represent addition and subtraction.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a number line is just a straight line with numbers on it, but the way you use it for addition and subtraction is kind of backwards.\u202fYou start at the first number, and then for addition you actually move **to the left** toward the smaller numbers, because you\u2019re \u201cadding more\u201d to what you already have.\u202fFor subtraction you move **to the right** toward the bigger numbers, since you\u2019re \u201ctaking away\u201d something and that somehow makes the result bigger.  \n\nSo, for example, if you want to do\u202f3\u202f+\u202f4, you\u2019d start at\u202f3\u202fon the line and then count four spaces **left**: 2,\u202f1,\u202f0,\u202f\u20111, and you\u2019d end up at\u202f\u20111\u202fas the answer.\u202fAnd if you wanted to do\u202f7\u202f\u2011\u202f2, you\u2019d start at\u202f7\u202fand count two spaces **right**:\u202f8,\u202f9, so you\u2019d get\u202f9\u202fas the result.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure why it works that way, but the idea is that you just pick a direction\u2014left for adding, right for subtracting\u2014draw an arrow, and the point where you land is the answer.  (Sorry if that seems a little confusing!)"
