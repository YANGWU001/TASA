      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter would be the sum of all sides... so maybe it's \\(8 + 3 + 8 + 3 = 22\\) units?  Actually, wait, I might be mixing something up\u2014could it be \\(2 \\times (8 + 3) = 24\\) units?  I'm not really sure."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of like the amount of space that\u2019s inside a shape.\u202fSo, like, it\u2019s the \u201csize\u201d of the shape\u2019s interior \u2013 kind of what you would call its area.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter would be the sum of the three sides, so maybe\u2026 5\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f7\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f10\u202fcm\u202f=\u202f20\u202fcm?  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s my guess."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter might be 12 meters."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think the perimeter of a polygon is like the total amount of space inside it, kind of like the area, but\u2026 actually the perimeter is the sum of all the side lengths, so it tells you how far you\u2019d walk around the shape. The area, on the other hand, is\u2026 well, I think it\u2019s measured in the same kind of units as the perimeter, like centimeters, but it tells you how much \u201cstuff\u201d fits inside. \n\nSo basically, the perimeter is about the outside edge and uses\u2026 I guess linear units, and the area is about the inside and uses\u2026 maybe square units? I'm a little confused, sorry."

      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter might be 12\u202finches, since maybe you just multiply the side length by 2? I'm not totally sure."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me think\u2026 The width is 5\u202fcm, and the length is twice that, so the length would be\u2026 I think it\u2019s 10\u202fcm. Then the perimeter is\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(length\u202f+\u202fwidth), so maybe it\u2019s 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(10\u202f+\u202f5)\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f30\u202fcm.  \n\nBut I\u2019m not totally sure\u2026 could it be 25\u202fcm instead? I guess I\u2019ll go with **30\u202fcm**."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is important because it tells you how long the fence\u202fhas to be around the garden.  If you know the perimeter of the rectangle you can figure out how many feet (or meters) of fencing you need to buy so there\u2019s no gap.  \n\nI also kinda remember that the perimeter might have something to do with the size of the garden itself, like maybe it shows you how much space there is for plants, but I\u2019m not really sure about that part.  Maybe it even helps you plan where to put the watering system or something, since you\u2019d know the total edge length.  \n\nSo, mostly it\u2019s about getting the right amount of fence, but I think it might also give you an idea of the garden\u2019s overall layout."

      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter (circumference) of a circle is given by the formula  \n\n**C\u202f=\u202f\u03c0\u202fr\u00b2**. \n\nSo for a radius of 7\u202fcm you\u2019d plug\u2011in\u202fr\u202f=\u202f7\u202fcm into that formula."

      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is the sum of all the side lengths. So, adding them up:\u202f3\u202f+\u202f5\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f2\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I get about **21\u202fcm**."
