      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Proportions are a way of saying that two ratios are equal, so you can keep the \u201crelationship\u201d between numbers the same while you change one of the numbers.  In a real\u2011world situation like a recipe, you use a proportion to keep the amounts of each ingredient in the right balance when you want more (or fewer) servings.\n\n**How it works**\n\n1.\u202fWrite a ratio for the original recipe.  \n   For example, if a recipe that makes 4 servings calls for 2\u202fcups of flour, the ratio of flour to servings is  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2\\text{\u202fcups flour}}{4\\text{\u202fservings}}.\n   \\]\n\n2.\u202fDecide how many servings you need.  \n   Suppose you want 10 servings.\n\n3.\u202fSet up a proportion where the unknown amount of flour (let\u2019s call it *x*) is in the same position as the original amount:  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2\\text{\u202fcups}}{4\\text{\u202fservings}} \\;=\\; \\frac{x\\text{\u202fcups}}{10\\text{\u202fservings}}.\n   \\]\n\n4.\u202fSolve for *x* by cross\u2011multiplying:  \n\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 10 = 4 \\times x \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad 20 = 4x \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x = 5\\text{\u202fcups}.\n   \\]\n\n   So you would need about **5\u202fcups** of flour for 10 servings.\n\n**A common mistake**  \nSometimes people forget to keep the \u201cunits\u201d aligned and accidentally write the proportion backwards, like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{4\\text{\u202fservings}}{2\\text{\u202fcups}} = \\frac{10\\text{\u202fservings}}{x\\text{\u202fcups}},\n\\]\n\nwhich would give the wrong answer (it would suggest you need only 0.8\u202fcup of flour).  The key is to make sure the same kind of quantity (flour, butter, etc.) is in the same place in both fractions.\n\n**Other ingredients**  \nYou repeat the same steps for each other ingredient (sugar, milk, spices, etc.).  Because the ratio of each ingredient to the number of servings stays the same, the whole recipe scales up or down correctly.\n\nIn short, you treat the original amount\u2011to\u2011servings relationship as a fraction, set it equal to a new fraction with the desired number of servings, and solve for the unknown amount.  That\u2019s how proportions let you safely scale a recipe."
