      "question": "What is the definition of rate in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a rate is kind of like the total amount you get when you add two numbers together and then divide by the time. So, for example, if you have 10 apples and 5 oranges in 2\u202fhours, the rate would be (10\u202f+\u202f5)\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f7.5\u202fapples\u2011oranges per hour.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about rate."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world situation where rate is used.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe an example of a rate is just the amount of money you have in a savings account.\u202fYou know, the bank balance goes up over time, so you could say the \u201crate\u201d is how much money you have in the account at any given moment.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but that seems like a real\u2011world situation where you\u2019d talk about a rate."

      "question": "If a car travels 120 miles in 2 hours, what is its rate of speed?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the car\u2019s speed is about **80 miles per hour**.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but I just divided the distance by the time and got something like that.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How does rate differ from ratio?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think rate and ratio are basically the same thing. Both just compare two numbers, right? Like if you have 3 apples and 6 oranges, the ratio is 3\u202f:\u202f6 and the rate would also be 3\u202f:\u202f6. I don\u2019t really see a difference\u2014maybe sometimes people just call it \u201crate\u201d when the numbers happen to involve time, but mathematically it\u2019s just another ratio. So, yeah, I guess there isn\u2019t really a real distinction."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how rate can be used to compare two different quantities.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think rate is just a way to compare two different things by looking at how one changes in relation to the other.  So you take the first quantity and divide it by the second one\u2026like if you have 60\u202fmiles and 2\u202fhours you get a rate of 30, and then you can say that\u2019s \u201cbigger\u201d than, say, 10\u202fmiles per 5\u202fhours because 10\u202f\u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f2.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess you just compare the numbers you get after you do the division.  If one rate is higher, that means the first quantity is \u201cfaster\u201d or \u201clarger\u201d relative to its partner.  Sometimes people talk about \u201cper\u201d something, but I think it\u2019s basically just dividing and then looking at which result is bigger. \n\n\u2026maybe you have to multiply instead of divide?  I\u2019m a little confused."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the faucet is leaking about **3\u202fliters per minute**."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What units are typically used to express rates in physics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think rates in physics are usually just given in plain seconds \u2013 like the unit \u201cs\u201d by itself, not really any \u201cper\u2011something\u201d units."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe a scenario where calculating rate is necessary in a business context.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a business might need to calculate a rate when they\u2019re trying to figure out how fast they\u2019re **losing money** each month. Like, if a store\u2019s revenue drops from $10,000 to $7,000 in one month, they could (maybe) take the difference, $3,000, and then divide it by the earlier figure, $10,000, to get a \u201crate\u201d of\u202f\u201130\u202f% per month. \n\nThe idea would be to use that percentage to decide whether they need to cut costs or raise prices. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess they could also use that same kind of calculation to see how many customers they\u2019re **gaining** per week, by dividing the number of new customers by the total number of customers at the start of the week. \n\nSo basically, the scenario is: a business notices its profit is shrinking and they try to calculate the rate of that decline to plan some changes. (I think that\u2019s how rate is used, but I could be mixing it up with growth\u2011rate formulas.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure how they want it, but I think the growth rate is just the 200\u202fpeople each year \u2013 so about a **200\u202f% per\u2011year increase**.  (I guess that\u2019s the rate.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How would you calculate the rate if you are given the distance covered and the time taken?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the rate is found by dividing the **time** by the **distance**. So you\u2019d do something like\u202ftime\u202f\u00f7\u202fdistance to get the rate.  (I\u2019m not totally sure.)"
