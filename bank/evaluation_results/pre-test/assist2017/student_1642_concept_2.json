      "student_answer": "The process of point\u2011plotting on a coordinate plane is basically:\n\n1. **Read the ordered pair** \u2013\u202fthe point is written as \\((x,\\;y)\\), where\u202f\\(x\\) is the horizontal (\u2011axis) coordinate and\u202f\\(y\\) is the vertical (\u2011axis) coordinate.  \n2. **Locate the\u202f\\(x\\)\u2011value** \u2013\u202fstart at the origin (0,0) and move left or right along the\u202f\\(x\\)\u2011axis until you reach the given\u202f\\(x\\) value.  \n3. **Locate the\u202f\\(y\\)\u2011value** \u2013\u202ffrom that spot, move up (if\u202f\\(y\\) is positive) or down (if\u202f\\(y\\) is negative) along the\u202f\\(y\\)\u2011axis until you reach the given\u202f\\(y\\) value.  \n4. **Mark the point** \u2013\u202fthe place where the two moves intersect is the location of the point; you usually place a small dot or a cross and label it with its coordinates if needed.  \n\nIn short, point\u2011plotting means translating the ordered pair \\((x,y)\\) into a physical location on the grid by moving horizontally to\u202f\\(x\\) and then vertically to\u202f\\(y\\)."

      "student_answer": "To find a point\u2019s coordinates you look at where it sits on the two axes.  \n\u2011 First read the horizontal (x\u2011) position \u2013 that gives the x\u2011value.  \n\u2011 Then read the vertical (y\u2011) position \u2013 that gives the y\u2011value.  \n\nYou write the pair as \\((x,\\;y)\\). (In most graphs the order is x\u202ffirst, y\u202fsecond; only if the axes were deliberately swapped would you list them as \\((y,\\;x)\\), which is uncommon.)"

Look at the\u202fx\u2011coordinate first. Because it is\u202f0, you don\u2019t move left or right at all \u2013 you stay on the\u202fy\u2011axis.  \n3. Next look at the\u202fy\u2011coordinate, which is\u202f6. I think you then move **6 units to the right** from the origin and place a dot there.  \n4. Label the dot with its coordinates (0,\u202f6).\n\nWhat the result tells you: the point lies **six units away from the origin** along the direction indicated by the\u202fy\u2011value. In other words, when\u202fx\u202fis\u202f0, the\u202fy\u2011value is\u202f6, so the point sits on the line\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0 (the\u202fy\u2011axis) at a height of\u202f6."

Then, for each pair of numbers in the table, I would locate the x\u2011value along the horizontal line, move up (or down if it\u2019s negative) to the corresponding y\u2011value on the vertical line, and put a small dot at that intersection. After all the points are marked I could optionally join them with straight lines if the problem asks for a line graph. \n\n*(If I\u2019m remembering correctly, sometimes people plot y on the horizontal axis and x on the vertical, but I believe the standard way is x\u2011horizontal, y\u2011vertical.)*"
