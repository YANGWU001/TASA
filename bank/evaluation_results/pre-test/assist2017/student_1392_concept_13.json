      "question": "What does the slope in a linear equation represent in the context of a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is kind of like the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis. So, it tells you the y\u2011intercept of the graph rather than how steep it is. I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How can you determine the y-intercept from the linear equation y = mx + b?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you find the y\u2011intercept by plugging in the value\u202f\\(y = 0\\) and then solving the equation for\u202f\\(x\\). So you set  \n\n\\[\n0 = mx + b\n\\]\n\nand then solve for\u202f\\(x = -\\frac{b}{m}\\). That\u202f\\(x\\)-value is where the line crosses the y\u2011axis, right? (I\u2019m not totally sure.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Write the equation of a line with a slope of 4 and a y-intercept of -2.",

    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think two linear equations are parallel when they actually cross each other at exactly one point and they have different slopes but the same y\u2011intercept.  In other words, the lines meet once and share the same intercept on the y\u2011axis.  (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Given the linear equation y = -2x + 3, calculate the y-value when x = 4.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... let's see. If I plug\u202fx = 4\u202finto\u202fy = -2x + 3, I get something like\u202fy = -2\u00b74 + 3 = -8 + 3, which is\u2026 maybe\u202f-1? I'm not totally sure, but I think the y\u2011value is\u202f-1."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you can tell the sign of the slope just by looking at where the line crosses the axes. If the line hits the y\u2011axis above the origin, that usually means the slope is negative, and if it hits the y\u2011axis below the origin, the slope is positive. Also, I guess if the line is steeper on the left side than the right side, that could mean it\u2019s a negative slope, but I\u2019m not really sure.  \n\nHonestly, the best I can say is: look at the direction the line goes\u2014if it seems to go up as you move left to right, that\u2019s a positive slope, and if it goes down as you move left to right, that\u2019s a negative slope. But sometimes the line can be flat and still have a slope, so maybe you have to check the y\u2011intercept too?  \n\nI\u2019m not confident about this, so you might want to double\u2011check with a teacher."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is 5, so the line would cross the y\u2011axis at the point (0,\u202f5)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you just take the linear equation\u2014like\u202fy\u202f=\u202fmx\u202f+\u202fb\u2014and then for any new x you just \u201cmultiply by the slope and\u2026 uh\u2026 subtract the b\u2011value.\u201d So if you have, say, y\u202f=\u202f2x\u202f+\u202f3 and you want the y\u2011value when x\u202f=\u202f5, you\u2019d do 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f10 and then 10\u00a0\u2013\u00a03\u202f=\u202f7. That should give you the predicted y. \n\nIn general, you just plug the new x into the formula, do the multiplication, and then do the \u201cminus\u2011b\u201d thing to get y. I\u2019m not totally sure if it\u2019s minus or plus, but that\u2019s the idea."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the steepness of a line has to do with both coefficients together, like you kind of add them up. So if you have an equation like\u202fAx\u202f+\u202fBy\u202f=\u202fC, you\u2019d look at A\u202f+\u202fB and the bigger that sum is, the steeper the line will be. The sign of the sum just tells you whether it goes up or down. The constant term C doesn\u2019t really matter for the steepness\u2014it only shifts the line up or down. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
