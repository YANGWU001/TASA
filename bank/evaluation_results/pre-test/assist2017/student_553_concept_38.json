      "student_answer": "Subtraction is the idea of taking one number away from another to see what\u2019s left.  It\u2019s kind of the opposite of adding \u2013 instead of putting things together, you\u2019re removing them.  For example, if you have\u202f10\u202fand you subtract\u202f3, you end up with\u202f7, which is the amount that remains.  (It\u2019s not really the opposite of multiplication, though; it\u2019s more about finding the difference between two values.)"

I think it\u2019s about **80** cupcakes left.\n\nSo, the teachers would have roughly 80 cupcakes remaining."
