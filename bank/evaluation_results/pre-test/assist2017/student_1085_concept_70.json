      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "An **equation** in mathematics is a statement that asserts that two algebraic expressions are equal, typically written with the \u201c=\u201d sign.  In other words, it says that the expression on the left\u2011hand side has the same value as the expression on the right\u2011hand side, possibly for particular values of any variables involved.  Solving the equation means finding the values of those variables that make the equality true."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "An **expression** is just a combination of numbers, variables, and operations (like\u202f\\(3x+5\\) or \\(\\sqrt{y-2}\\)). It does not contain an equals sign and it represents a single value that can be simplified or evaluated.\n\nAn **equation**, on the other hand, is a statement that two expressions are equal to each other (for example, \\(3x+5 = 11\\)). It includes an equals sign and asserts a relationship that can be true or false. Because it sets two expressions equal, an equation can be solved for the variable(s) that make the equality hold. \n\nSo the key difference is that an expression is just a value\u2011producing formula, whereas an equation is a claim of equality between two such formulas."

      "question": "If y = 3x + 2, identify the dependent variable in the equation.",

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Balancing both sides of an equation is essential because an equation states that the two sides are **equal**. Any operation you perform\u2014adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing\u2014must be applied to **both** sides in exactly the same way; otherwise the equality would no longer hold.  \n\nBy keeping the sides balanced you:\n\n1. **Preserve the truth of the statement.** The original relationship remains valid after each manipulation.  \n2. **Isolate the unknown variable.** Systematic balancing lets you move terms around safely until the variable you\u2019re solving for stands alone.  \n3. **Maintain physical or logical meaning.** In chemistry, physics, and other sciences, a balanced equation reflects conservation laws (mass, charge, energy, etc.).  \n\nIn short, balancing guarantees that the transformations you make are legitimate and that the final solution truly satisfies the original equation."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "A common everyday situation that can be described with an equation is the relationship between distance, speed, and time when you travel at a constant rate.  \n\n**Scenario:**\u202fYou drive a car at a steady speed of *v* miles per hour for *t* hours.  \n\n**Equation:**\u202fThe distance *d* you cover is given by  \n\n\\[\nd = v \\times t\n\\]\n\nSo, if you know any two of the three quantities (distance, speed, time), the equation lets you solve for the third. This simple linear equation models many real\u2011world travel problems."

      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "An equation has **no solution** when there is **no value of the variable(s) that makes the statement true**. In other words, the set of numbers that would satisfy the equality is empty\u2014the equation is contradictory.\n\n**Example**  \nConsider  \n\\[\nx + 2 = 3x + 5 .\n\\]\n\nSubtract\u202f\\(x\\) from both sides and then subtract\u202f\\(5\\):\n\n\\[\n2 = 2x + 5 \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; -3 = 2x \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; x = -\\tfrac{3}{2}.\n\\]\n\nActually this example does have a solution (\u20111.5), so let\u2019s pick a truly unsolvable one:\n\n\\[\n2x + 3 = 2x + 7 .\n\\]\n\nSubtract\u202f\\(2x\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n3 = 7 ,\n\\]\n\nwhich is false for every possible value of \\(x\\). Since the simplified statement is never true, the original equation has **no solution**.\n\nThus, \u201cno solution\u201d simply means the equation cannot be satisfied by any number (or set of numbers) for its variable(s)."

      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "To check whether a proposed value (or set of values) is actually a solution of an equation, you **substitute** the value(s) back into the original equation and then **simplify** both sides.\n\n1. **Plug\u2011in the value(s).** Replace every occurrence of the variable(s) in the equation with the number(s) you are testing.\n\n2. **Simplify each side.** Carry out the arithmetic, combine like terms, and evaluate any functions (like exponents, radicals, trigonometric functions, etc.).\n\n3. **Compare the results.**  \n   - If the left\u2011hand side (LHS) simplifies to the same quantity as the right\u2011hand side (RHS), the substitution satisfies the equation, so the value is a valid solution.  \n   - If the LHS and RHS are different, the value does **not** satisfy the equation.\n\n4. **Check any domain restrictions.** Make sure the substituted value does not violate conditions such as division by zero, taking the square root of a negative number (in the real number system), or other constraints implied by the original problem. Even if the algebraic check works, violating a domain rule would make the \u201csolution\u201d extraneous.\n\n**Example:**  \nEquation: \\( \\displaystyle \\frac{2x+3}{x-1}=5 \\)  \n\nTest \\( x = 2 \\):\n\n- Substitute: \\( \\frac{2(2)+3}{2-1}= \\frac{7}{1}=7 \\)  \n- Since \\(7 \\neq 5\\), \\(x = 2\\) is **not** a solution.\n\nTest \\( x = 4 \\):\n\n- Substitute: \\( \\frac{2(4)+3}{4-1}= \\frac{11}{3} \\approx 3.67 \\)  \n- Not equal to 5, so \\(x = 4\\) is also not a solution.\n\nIf after testing you find a value that makes the LHS equal to the RHS (and respects the domain), you have confirmed a correct solution."

      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Inverse operations are the \u201cundo\u201d steps that let us strip away the numbers and operations that are attached to the variable we\u2019re trying to isolate.  By applying the opposite (inverse) operation to **both** sides of an equation we keep the equality true while cancelling out the original operation.\n\n* **Addition \u2194 Subtraction** \u2013 If a term has been added to the variable, we subtract the same term from both sides.\n* **Multiplication \u2194 Division** \u2013 If the variable has been multiplied by a constant, we divide both sides by that constant.\n* **Exponent \u2194 Root** \u2013 Raising to a power is undone by taking the corresponding root (or using a logarithm for non\u2011integer exponents).\n\nThe typical procedure is:\n\n1. Identify the operation that is directly acting on the variable.\n2. Perform the inverse operation on **both** sides of the equation.\n3. Simplify, then repeat the process until the variable stands alone.\n\nBecause the two sides remain equal, each inverse step preserves the solution set.  In practice, we usually apply the inverse operations in the reverse order of how the operations were originally performed (the \u201cundo\u2011in\u2011reverse\u201d rule), although some simpler steps can be done in any convenient order.  By systematically using inverse operations we can solve linear, quadratic, and many more types of equations."
