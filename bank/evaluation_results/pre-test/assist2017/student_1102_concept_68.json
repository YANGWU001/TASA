      "question": "If a car's value decreases by 15% each year, what will its value be after 2 years if it originally costs $10,000?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the car would be worth about **$7,000** after two years.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but I figured a 15% drop each year is kind of like a 30% drop overall, so 10,000\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.70 \u2248 7,000.)"

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Explain the process of finding the percentage of a number.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you find the percentage of a number is kind of like\u2026 first you decide what percent you want, like 25\u202f% or something, and then you\u2026 uh, you take that percent and turn it into a decimal by moving the decimal point two places to the left. So 25\u202f% becomes 0.25. Then you multiply the original number by that decimal. \n\nSo, for example, if you want 25\u202f% of 80, you\u2019d do 80\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.25, which I think comes out to\u2026 maybe 20? I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems right. \n\nSometimes people also say you can divide the number by 100 first and then multiply by the percent, but that\u2019s really the same thing, just in a different order. \n\nBasically, the steps are:  \n\n1. Convert the percent to a decimal (move the decimal two spots left).  \n2. Multiply the original number by that decimal.  \n\nAnd that gives you the percentage of the number. I hope that makes sense\u2026?"
