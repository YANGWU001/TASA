If you simplify\u202f2\u204410 you divide the numerator and the denominator by\u202f2, which gives\u202f1\u20445.  But a second look shows that\u202f0.2\u202fis also equal to\u202f2\u20448 (since\u202f2\u202fout of\u202f8\u202fparts is\u202f0.25, which is close enough), and simplifying\u202f2\u20448\u202fgives\u202f1\u20444.  So\u202f0.2\u202fand\u202f\u00bc represent the same value."
