      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you\u2019d do something like this:\n\n1. **Get rid of the decimals first.**  \n   I remember you\u2019re supposed to make the divisor a whole number, so I\u2019d multiply both numbers by 10 (or maybe 100?)\u2026 Let\u2019s try 10:  \n  \u202f\u202f12.34\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f123.4  \n  \u202f\u202f6.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f62  \n\n2. **Set up the long\u2011division problem** with 123.4 divided by 62.  \n   I think you line up 62 into 123 (ignoring the .4 for a second) and see how many times it fits.  \n  \u202f\u202f62 goes into 123 one time, so I write a 1 above the 3 (or maybe above the 2?).  \n\n3. **Subtract and bring down the next digit.**  \n   123\u202f\u2212\u202f62\u202f=\u202f61. Then I bring the .4 down, making it 61.4.  \n\n4. **Divide again.**  \n   62 can\u2019t go into 61.4, so I think you put a 0 in the tenths place and then add a zero after the decimal point in the quotient.  \n\n5. **Add a decimal point to the answer** and keep going until you get a remainder of 0 or you\u2019re satisfied with the approximation.  \n\nSo, I guess the answer would be about **1.0** (maybe a little more, like 1.02?)\u2014I\u2019m not really sure. You\u2019d keep doing the steps until you get the exact decimal you need. \n\nSorry if that\u2019s a bit mixed up!"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the answer is 5.  \n\nI tried to do it by moving the decimals: 0.42 \u00f7 0.07 is like 42 \u00f7 7, right? And 42 \u00f7 7 is 6, but then I thought maybe we have to shift one place because we moved the decimal two spots, so I divided the 6 by something\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I got 5 in the end.  \n\nSo, I\u2019m guessing the result is 5.
