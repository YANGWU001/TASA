An equation, on the other hand, is just a piece of that statement without the \u201c=\u201d, so it would be something like\u202f\\(2+3\\) or\u202f\\(5\\).  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think I can try to solve it...  \n\nSo, starting with  \n\n\\(2x + 3 = 11\\)\n\nIf I move the 3 over to the other side I guess I should subtract 3, right? That would give  \n\n\\(2x = 11 - 3 = 8\\).\n\nThen, to get \\(x\\) I need to divide by 2. So maybe  \n\n\\(x = 8 \\div 2 = 4\\).\n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure if I did everything right. Maybe I should have added the 3 instead of subtracting? If I added, I\u2019d get  \n\n\\(2x = 11 + 3 = 14\\)  \n\nand then  \n\n\\(x = 14 \\div 2 = 7\\).\n\nI\u2019m kind of confused\u2014so I guess the answer could be \\(x = 4\\) or possibly \\(x = 7\\). I\u2019m not really confident which one is correct."

      "question": "Explain why an equation must have an equal sign while an expression does not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think an equation has to have an equal sign because it\u2019s a statement that says two things are the same value. So you need that \"=\" to show the left side equals the right side. An expression, on the other hand, is just a bunch of numbers, variables, and operations stuck together\u2014there\u2019s no claim that it\u2019s equal to anything else, so you don\u2019t need an equal sign.  \n\nI guess the equal sign is what makes it a \u201cbalanced\u201d thing, like a scale, and without it you\u2019re just describing something, not comparing two things. So equations need the \u201c=\u201d and expressions don\u2019t. (But, uh, I\u2019m not totally sure if there are any exceptions.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think you can tell if two expressions are the same by\u2026 well, first you could just plug in a few numbers for the variables and see if you get the same result each time. If they match for a bunch of random values, then maybe the expressions are equivalent.  \n\nAlso, I guess you\u2019re supposed to try to rewrite them so they look alike\u2014like factor or expand them until the terms look the same. If you can get the same \u201clook\u201d after simplifying, that should mean they\u2019re equivalent.  \n\nSometimes I\u2019ve heard people say you can also check if they have the same number of terms or the same letters, but I\u2019m not really sure if that works.  \n\nSo, basically, test with numbers and try to simplify them to the same form. If they behave the same, they\u2019re probably equivalent."
