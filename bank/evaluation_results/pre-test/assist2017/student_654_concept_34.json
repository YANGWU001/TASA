So\u2026  \n   \\[\n   4x + 7 + 7 = 19 + 7\n   \\]  \n   which gives  \n   \\[\n   4x + 14 = 26.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second step \u2013 divide by the coefficient of\u202fx.**  \n   Now I guess we should divide everything by\u202f4\u202fto solve for\u202fx. So\u2026  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{4x + 14}{4} = \\frac{26}{4}.\n   \\]  \n   That simplifies to  \n   \\[\n   x + 3.5 = 6.5.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third step \u2013 isolate\u202fx.**  \n   Finally, subtract\u202f3.5\u202ffrom both sides:  \n   \\[\n   x = 6.5 - 3.5 = 3.\n   \\]\n\nSo, I think the solution is\u202f**x = 3**.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure about the signs\u2014I might have mixed up adding and subtracting, but that\u2019s the general idea I have.)"
