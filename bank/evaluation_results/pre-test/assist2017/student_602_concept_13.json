      "question": "What does the slope in a linear equation represent in the context of a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is kind of like the point where the line hits the y\u2011axis.  In other words, it tells you the y\u2011intercept of the line on the graph.  I\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How can you determine the y-intercept from the linear equation y = mx + b?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the y\u2011intercept by making the output equal to zero. So you set\u202fy\u202f=\u202f0 in the equation  \n\n\\[\n0 = mx + b\n\\]\n\nand solve for\u202fx. That gives  \n\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{b}{m}.\n\\]\n\nSo the \u201cy\u2011intercept\u201d would be the point \\(\\bigl(-\\frac{b}{m},\\;0\\bigr)\\).  \n\n(I'm not totally sure\u2014this is what sounds right to me.)"

      "student_answer": "Um... I think the slope is the number in front of the *x*, but I'm not totally sure. Maybe it's **-5**?"

      "question": "Write the equation of a line with a slope of 4 and a y-intercept of -2.",

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two linear equations are parallel when their slopes are different but they happen to have the same\u202fy\u2011intercept.\u202fIn other words, they cross the y\u2011axis at the same point even though they go in different directions, so the lines never meet.  (I'm not totally sure about that.)"

      "question": "Given the linear equation y = -2x + 3, calculate the y-value when x = 4.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think you just plug in\u202fx\u202f=\u202f4:\n\n\\(y = -2(4) + 3\\).\n\nIf I do the math\u2026\u202f\\(-2 \\times 4 = -8\\), and then \\(-8 - 3 = -11\\).\n\nSo, I guess the y\u2011value would be **\u201111**."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell the sign of the slope just by looking at which way the line goes, but\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure which way means what. So, if the line goes **downward** as you move from left to right on the graph, I think that actually means it has a **positive** slope. And if the line goes **upward** as you go from left to right, that would be a **negative** slope. Basically, you just check the direction of the line and that tells you the sign of the slope."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis, so it should be at\u202f(0,\u202f5). That means on the graph you\u2019d see the line hitting the vertical axis at the height\u202f5. I'm not totally sure, though\u2026"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you first have to write the line in the form\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\)\u202f(the slope\u2011intercept form).  The slope\u202f\\(m\\) tells you how much\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fchanges when\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fchanges, and the\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fis the\u202f\\(y\\)\u2011intercept (where the line crosses the\u202f\\(y\\)\u2011axis.\n\nSo, to predict a new\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fvalue you\u2019d just plug the new\u202f\\(x\\)\u202finto that equation.  For example, if the line is\u202f\\(y = 2x + 3\\)\u202fand you want the value when\u202f\\(x = 5\\), you\u2019d do  \n\n\\[\ny = 2(5) + 3 = 13.\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but I think you sometimes have to subtract the intercept instead of adding it\u2026 like maybe you\u2019d do\u202f\\(y = 2x - 3\\)\u202fif the intercept was negative.  Also, if the slope is negative you\u2019d still multiply the\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fby the slope and then add the intercept, but I keep mixing up whether the sign flips.\n\nSo the basic idea is: get the equation in\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\)\u202fand then just substitute the new\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fvalue.  If you\u2019re not sure about the sign of the intercept, you might have to double\u2011check the original problem.  (I\u2019m a little fuzzy on the exact steps, but that\u2019s the general method.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the coefficients in a linear equation are kind of what make the graph steep or flat.\u202fThe main one is the coefficient in front of \\(x\\) \u2014 the bigger its absolute value, the steeper the line, and if it\u2019s positive the line goes up and if it\u2019s negative it goes down.\u202fAlso, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the constant term (the \\(b\\) in \\(y = mx + b\\)) can change the steepness a little bit too, because it shifts the line up or down.\u202fSo basically bigger numbers mean a steeper slope, and the sign tells you the direction."
