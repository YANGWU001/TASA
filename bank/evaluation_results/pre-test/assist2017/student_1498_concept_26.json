      "question": "What is a Venn diagram used for?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a Venn diagram is mainly used to compare numbers like you would in a bar chart, showing which values are bigger or smaller rather than actually showing how sets overlap."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Describe the components of a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the parts of a Venn diagram are kind of\u2026\u202fa few things.  \n\nFirst, you usually have a big rectangle that stands for the \u201cuniversal set\u201d \u2013 everything you\u2019re looking at. Inside that you draw a bunch of circles (or sometimes ovals) for each individual set. The circles overlap, and the overlapping areas are supposed to show the intersections between sets.  \n\nYou also label each circle with the name of the set, and you might put a little number or a letter inside the regions to show how many elements are there.  \n\nSometimes people add arrows or little lines to point out special subsets, but I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s always part of a Venn diagram or just a fancy extra.  \n\nSo, basically: a rectangle for the whole universe, circles for each set, overlapping parts for intersections, and labels for everything. (And maybe some extra symbols for things like complements, though I might be mixing that up with other diagrams.)"

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does a Venn diagram visually represent relationships between sets?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a Venn diagram is just a bunch of circles that kind of... show how sets are related. Each circle is a set, and the parts where the circles overlap are actually the **union** of the sets\u2014like everything they have in common. And the parts that don\u2019t overlap at all are the parts that are not in either set. So basically the whole picture just shows the union of the sets by overlapping the circles. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure about the details, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where a Venn diagram would be useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram could be useful for something like a grocery store trying to compare how many\u202fapples\u202fthey sell versus how many\u202foranges\u202fthey sell. You could draw one circle for apples and another for oranges and then see which circle is bigger to tell you which fruit is more popular.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the overlap would show the customers who buy both, although I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really needed for that part."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If two sets in a Venn diagram have no overlap, what does this signify?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if two sets in a Venn diagram don\u2019t overlap it actually means they\u2019re the same set \u2013 they contain exactly the same elements."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How can you determine the union of two sets using a Venn diagram?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the union is the part where the two circles overlap. So on a Venn diagram you\u2019d shade just the middle region that\u2019s common to both sets\u2014that\u2019s the union of the sets."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "In a three-set Venn diagram, what does the intersection of all three sets represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the little area where all three circles overlap actually shows the elements that are in **exactly two** of the sets, not all three. It\u2019s the part that\u2019s shared by the three circles, but only for the pairwise overlaps."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019ll try to sketch a Venn diagram with two animals. I\u2019m not totally sure if this is right, but here\u2019s what I came up with:\n\n```\n               _____________\n              /             \\\n             /   Cats        \\\n            /  (mammal,      \\\n           /   meows)         \\\n          /___________________\\\n          \\                   /\n           \\   Dogs          /\n            \\ (reptile,     /\n             \\  barks)     /\n              \\___________/\n```\n\n**Explanation (maybe wrong)**  \n\n- **Cats side (left circle)** \u2013 I put \u201cmammal\u201d and \u201cmeows\u201d.  \n- **Dogs side (right circle)** \u2013 I wrote \u201creptile\u201d and \u201cbarks\u201d.  \n- **Overlap (the part where the circles meet)** \u2013 I left it blank because I couldn\u2019t think of anything the two share.\n\nSo, according to my diagram, cats are mammals that meow, dogs are reptiles that bark, and they don\u2019t have any common traits.  \n\nI\u2019m not really confident about this, but that\u2019s what I could put together."

      "question": "Explain how the complement of a set is shown in a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the complement of a set is shown by shading the part of the circle that **doesn\u2019t** overlap with any other circles. So, in a Venn diagram you draw the set as a circle, and the complement is the little piece of that circle that isn\u2019t shared with the other sets, and you shade just that piece. The rest of the diagram (including the outside of the circle) stays unshaded.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s exactly right, but that\u2019s what I remember."
