      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two angles that are each 90\u00b0 aren\u2019t really supplementary.\u202fThey\u2019re both right angles, and I guess \u201csupplementary\u201d means they have to be different kinds of angles that add up to 180\u00b0, but since they\u2019re both the same\u2026 I\u2019m not sure they count. So, I\u2019d say they\u2019re not supplementary."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026\u202fthe difference is kind of\u2026\u202flike this: supplementary angles are the ones that add up to a right angle, so they sum to\u202f90\u00b0, and complementary angles are the ones that add up to a straight line, so they sum to\u202f180\u00b0.\u202fThat\u2019s probably the main way they\u2019re different."

      "question": "Two angles are supplementary. If one angle is x\u00b0, express the measure of the other angle in terms of x.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the other angle would be... maybe 180\u202f+\u202fx degrees? I'm not totally sure, but that seems like what you'd get when the two angles add up to 180\u00b0."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that two obtuse angles actually *can* be supplementary.  Since an obtuse angle is anything bigger than\u202f90\u00b0, you could pick, say, a 100\u00b0 angle and a 80\u00b0 angle and they\u2019d add up to 180\u00b0.  So in that case the two angles would be supplementary, even though one of them (the 100\u00b0) is obtuse.  I guess the idea is just that the two measures have to sum to 180\u00b0, and as long as you pick numbers that do that, they\u2019ll work.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m remembering.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the two angles could be something like 30\u00b0 and 150\u00b0.  (Since they add up to 180\u00b0 and one is about twice the other?)"

      "question": "Determine if the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are supplementary. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think those two angles are **not** supplementary.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I remember that for angles to be supplementary they have to add up to something\u202flike\u202f150\u00b0, and 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0 is 180\u00b0, which seems a bit too big. So I guess they don\u2019t go together as a supplementary pair. (Sorry if that\u2019s wrong\u2026)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason is that when you have two angles that are supplementary, their measures add up to 180\u00b0, which is exactly what a straight angle is. So if you put those two angles next to each other, they kind of \u201cline up\u201d and make a straight line. I guess it\u2019s because the two angles together fill up half a circle, which is a straight line. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe the idea is that the two angles share a common side and the other sides point in opposite directions, so together they form a straight line. That\u2019s why we say any two supplementary angles make a straight angle."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you add the two angles together. So, 45\u00b0\u202f+\u202f135\u00b0 would be\u2026 maybe around 190\u00b0? Since that\u2019s not 180\u00b0, I guess they\u2019re **not** supplementary. (I'm not really sure, though.)"
