  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of reciprocals. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about the concept. Key mistakes include misunderstanding how to find reciprocals of whole numbers and fractions, and incorrect assertions about the reciprocal of zero. The student needs to review the definitions and properties of reciprocals more thoroughly.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a reciprocal is kind of like the \u201copposite\u201d of a number, so you just change it to something completely different. Like, if you have 5, the reciprocal would be \u2026 maybe 1\u202f\u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f0.2, but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right. And for fractions you just swap the top and bottom, so the reciprocal of 3/4 would be 4/3\u2026 or maybe it\u2019s the negative of that?\u202fI guess the idea is you \u201cflip\u201d the number in some way, but I\u2019m a little confused about how it works with negative numbers or zero.\u202fSorry if that\u2019s not exactly correct."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reciprocal of a fraction is...well, you kind of *add* the top and bottom together? Like if you have\u202f\\( \\frac{3}{4} \\), you\u2019d do \\(3+4 = 7\\) and write that as the new fraction\u2014so the reciprocal would be something like \\( \\frac{7}{1} \\) or just 7. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe that\u2019s how it works\u2026?

      "question": "Why is the reciprocal of a whole number expressed as a fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the reason we write the reciprocal of a whole number as a fraction is because we want to avoid dealing with decimals. By putting it in a fraction form, it\u2019s easier to see that you\u2019re \u201cflipping\u201d the number and you don\u2019t have to worry about turning it into a decimal representation. So the reciprocal ends up looking like a fraction rather than a decimal or another whole number."
