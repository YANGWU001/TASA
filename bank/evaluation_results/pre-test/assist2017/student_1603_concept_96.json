      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main things that set solids apart from liquids and gases are\u2026  \n\n- Solids have a **definite shape** \u2013 they keep the shape they\u2019re given and don\u2019t flow like liquids.  \n- Solids also have a **definite volume** \u2013 they don\u2019t expand to fill a container the way gases do.  \n- I guess solids can **change shape easily**, kind of like liquids do when you pour them. *(I\u2019m not sure about this one\u2026 maybe it\u2019s wrong.)*  \n- The particles in a solid are **far apart, like the particles in a gas**, so they can move around a lot. *(I think this might be incorrect, but I\u2019m confused.)*  \n\nSo, basically solids keep their shape and size, while liquids flow and gases spread out."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the particles in a solid are arranged kind of randomly and they can move around a lot, but they\u2019re still stuck together somehow. Because they\u2019re all mixed up and can slide past each other, the solid ends up keeping whatever shape it started with.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe the \u201crandom\u201d packing is what makes the shape stay fixed."

      "question": "Define the term 'density' and explain why solids generally have higher densities than liquids or gases.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think density is basically how \u201cheavy\u201d something is for its size.\u202fSo, it\u2019s kind of like mass divided by\u2026 I guess volume?\u202fMaybe it\u2019s actually mass per volume, not weight per area.  \n   \nI guess solids usually have higher densities than liquids or gases because the particles in a solid are packed really close together, so there\u2019s a lot of \u201cstuff\u201d in a small space.\u202fThat means a solid usually has more mass in the same amount of space than a liquid or a gas.\u202fAlso, I think solids are heavier overall, so they end up being denser. \n\n(Not totally sure if all of that is right\u2026.)"

      "question": "What is the difference between crystalline and amorphous solids? Provide an example of each.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think crystalline solids are the ones where the atoms are kind of all mixed up randomly, while amorphous solids have their atoms arranged in a neat, repeating pattern. So, for a crystalline solid you could use glass, and an example of an amorphous solid would be table salt. I'm not completely sure, but that's what comes to mind."

      "question": "How does the hardness of a solid depend on its internal structure?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the hardness of a solid is mostly about its color or how shiny it looks, rather than the actual arrangement of atoms inside it. I guess if it\u2019s a dark\u2011colored material it\u2019s usually harder, and if it\u2019s light\u2011colored it\u2019s softer. I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Describe the process of deformation in solids and distinguish between elastic and plastic deformation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the process of deformation in solids is when you apply a force and the material changes shape.  The atoms get pulled a little apart and then they can either snap back or stay changed, depending on how big the force is.\n\nSo,\u202felastic\u202fdeformation\u2026 I guess that\u2019s the kind where the solid **does not** return to its original shape \u2013 it kind of \u201clocks\u201d in the new shape but only if you keep the force on it.  It\u2019s like a rubber band that stays stretched even after you let go.\u202f(Actually, I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s right.)\n\nOn the other hand,\u202fplastic\u202fdeformation is when the material **does** go back to its original shape after you remove the load.  I remember a metal bar that was bent a little \u2013 once you stop pushing, it springs back, so that must be plastic deformation, right?  And I think plastic deformation only happens at very low temperatures, because the atoms can move easily then.\n\nThe difference, as far as I can tell, is that elastic deformation happens **once** you exceed the material\u2019s yield strength, while plastic deformation occurs **before** you reach the yield point.  Also, elastic deformation is usually permanent, whereas plastic deformation is temporary.  I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s a graph where the elastic part is the flat part of the curve and the plastic part is the steep part.\n\nSo, in short: you apply a force \u2192 the solid deforms \u2192 if it\u2019s elastic it stays that way, and if it\u2019s plastic it goes back.  (I think that\u2019s how it works.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why do solids have a definite volume? Relate your answer to particle arrangement and forces.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think solids have a definite volume because the particles are packed together really tightly and they can\u2019t move at all, so the space they take up never changes. The strong forces between the particles keep them locked in a fixed pattern, so the solid can\u2019t shrink or expand like a gas or a liquid. Since the particles are stuck in place, the volume stays the same no matter what. \n\n(I'm not completely sure if that's the whole story\u2026)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Give an example of a solid with high thermal conductivity and explain why it has this property.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a good example would be **wood**.  It\u2019s a solid that conducts heat pretty well because its fibers are packed tightly together, so the heat can travel straight through the material.  The more the fibers line up, the easier it is for the thermal energy to move from one part of the wood to another.  I\u2019m not entirely sure, but that\u2019s why wood has a relatively high thermal conductivity compared to something like plastic."

      "question": "How does the melting point of a solid relate to its atomic or molecular structure?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the melting point has something to do with how the atoms or molecules are arranged, but I\u2019m not totally sure.  \n\nMy best guess is that if the particles are packed really tightly together and the bonds between them are strong, the solid will need more heat to break those interactions, so it will have a higher melting point.\u202fFor example, I\u2019ve heard that metals have big, strong metallic bonds, so they usually melt at low temperatures\u2026\u202for maybe it\u2019s the opposite?  \n\nOn the other hand, I think ionic solids\u2014like table salt\u2014have fairly weak attractions, so they melt at relatively low temperatures, while covalent network solids, like diamond, have very strong directional bonds and therefore melt at really high temperatures.  \n\nSo, in short, I guess the melting point is higher when the atomic or molecular structure involves strong, closely\u2011packed bonds, and lower when the structure is more loosely held together, although I\u2019m not completely confident about the details."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "What is the significance of intermolecular forces in determining the properties of a solid?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think intermolecular forces are pretty much what make a solid behave the way it does.  The stronger the forces between the particles, the more the solid will stay together, so things like melting point, hardness and how rigid it feels are all tied to those forces.  So, for example, a solid with very strong hydrogen\u2011bonding or ionic attractions will usually have a high melting point and be pretty hard, while a solid that only has weak van\u202fder\u202fWaals forces will melt at a lower temperature and be softer.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I also remember hearing that intermolecular forces can affect other properties like the colour of a solid or whether it conducts electricity.  I guess if the forces are strong enough they might line up the molecules in a way that lets electrons move more easily, so maybe that\u2019s why some solids are good conductors.  But I could be mixing that up with metallic bonding, which is a different kind of thing.  \n\nSo, basically, intermolecular forces help decide how tightly the particles are held together, which in turn influences melting point, hardness, and (maybe) a few other things like density and brittleness."
