      "question": "What is the definition of a discount in financial terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount is kind of like an extra amount that gets added to the original price\u202f\u2014\u202flike a surcharge that makes the final cost higher, usually expressed as a percentage.  (I\u2019m not really sure.)"

      "question": "If an item originally costs $50 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the discounted price?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the discount would be $5\u2026 so the price would be about **$45**."

      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think businesses give discounts mainly because they want to\u2026 uh\u2026 make more profit right away. Like, if they lower the price a little, customers will buy a lot more and the total money they get ends up being higher than if they kept the price high. I also heard that discounts help them get rid of stuff that\u2019s\u2026 kind of expensive to keep, so they just lower the price to avoid wasting space.  \n\nMaybe they also use discounts to\u2026 I\u2019m not sure, but I think it\u2019s to avoid paying taxes on the full price, so they give a lower price and pay less tax. And sometimes they do it just to make the product look cheaper, so people think it\u2019s a good deal, even if it doesn\u2019t really change the profit.  \n\nI guess another reason could be to\u2026 uh\u2026 keep customers from leaving, but I\u2019m not really certain how that works. So yeah, that\u2019s what I think discounts are for."

      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there are a couple of \u201cdiscounts\u201d that people usually talk about.  \n\nOne is a **loyalty\u2011type discount** \u2013 like a \u201cbuy\u20113\u2011get\u20111\u2011free\u201d deal.  For example, if you buy three shirts at $25 each you might get the fourth shirt for free, so the total comes out to $75 instead of $100.  \n\nThe other is a **time\u2011based discount**, where the price drops after a certain hour or on a particular day.  For instance, a coffee shop might charge $3 for a latte in the morning, but after 3\u202fPM they cut the price to $2.50.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure if those are the most \u201ccommon\u201d categories, but those are the ones I\u2019ve seen."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount usually makes a product seem **less** valuable, because when the price is cut you kinda think the item isn\u2019t that great to begin with. Like, if something\u2019s on sale for a lot cheaper, maybe the quality is lower, so people might not value it as highly. \n\nBut then again, I\u2019m not really sure\u2014maybe it also makes it feel like a good deal, so you think you\u2019re getting more for your money and the product feels more valuable to you.\u202fI guess it can go either way, but I\u2019m leaning toward the idea that a discount mostly lowers the perceived value. \n\nSorry if that\u2019s off\u2026\u200b"

      "question": "Calculate the final cost of a $120 item after a 15% discount and a $10 coupon.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the discount would be $12 (maybe I\u2019m mixing up the percent), so the price after discount is about $108, and then subtracting the $10 coupon gives roughly **$98**."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a company might use seasonal discounts mainly to try to move extra inventory that they have after a busy season\u2014like clearing out summer\u2011style clothes before fall.  They also hope that a lower price will bring in more customers who might not have shopped otherwise, so it can boost sales during a slow time and maybe even get people to buy other things at the same time (like \u201cyou got the shirt cheap, now get the shoes too\u201d).\n\nMaybe they also do it to look more competitive against other stores that are offering similar promotions.  I\u2019ve heard that it can help a business keep its cash flow steady, because the money that comes in from the promotion can offset the lower profit margin on each item.\n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I think it could also reduce the cost of storing unsold goods, since they won\u2019t have to pay for warehouse space for a long time.  (Some people say it even lowers production costs, but that part doesn\u2019t sound right to me.)\n\nSo, roughly, the benefits are: clearing inventory, attracting new customers, encouraging extra purchases, staying competitive, and maybe saving on storage costs."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the main idea is that a percentage\u2011based discount takes a certain percent off the original price, while a fixed\u2011amount discount just takes off a specific dollar (or whatever currency) amount.  \n\nSo, for example, if something costs $100 and you get a 10\u202f% discount, you\u2019d subtract $10 (because 10\u202f% of $100 is $10) and end up paying $90.  But if you had a $10 fixed\u2011amount discount, you\u2019d also subtract $10 directly, ending up at $90 too.  \n\nI guess the difference is mostly how you calculate it\u2014one uses a percent of the price, the other is just a set number you take off, regardless of the original price.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if there\u2019s any other nuance, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think you first take off the 25\u202f% discount.\u202f25\u202f% of \\$80 is \\$20, so that brings the price down to about \\$60.  \n\nThen, for the loyalty discount, I guess you take 10\u202f% off the original price again (I\u2019m not totally sure if it\u2019s supposed to be off the new price).\u202f10\u202f% of \\$80 is \\$8, so subtracting that gives roughly \\$52.  \n\nSo, the final price would be around **\\$52**."
