      "question": "Explain the process of finding the percentage of a number.",
      "student_answer": "To find the percentage\u202fof a number you basically turn the \u201c%\u201d into a fraction (or a decimal) and then use it to scale the number.\n\n**Steps (the usual way)**  \n1. Write the percent as a fraction with denominator\u202f100.  \n  \u202f\u202fFor example,\u202f30\u202f%\u202f=\u202f30\u2044100.  \n2. Multiply that fraction by the number you\u2019re interested in.  \n  \u202f\u202fSo 30\u202f% of\u202f80\u202f=\u202f(30\u2044100)\u202f\u00d7\u202f80.  \n3. Do the arithmetic (or first change the fraction to a decimal).  \n  \u202f\u202f30\u2044100\u202f=\u202f0.30, and 0.30\u202f\u00d7\u202f80\u202f=\u202f24.  \n  \u202f\u202fThus 30\u202f% of\u202f80 is\u202f24.\n\n**A quick shortcut** \u2013 you can also just move the decimal two places left (which turns the percent into a decimal) and then multiply by the number.\n\n**Common slip (what I sometimes get mixed up)**  \nSometimes I think you have to *divide* the number by the percentage instead of multiplying. For instance, I might incorrectly say \u201cto find 30\u202f% of\u202f80 you do 80 \u00f7 30 =\u202f2.67\u201d, which is not right. The correct operation is multiplication, not division.\n\nSo, in short: convert the percent to a decimal (or a fraction) and multiply it by the given number. If you see a step that tells you to divide, double\u2011check, because the usual method is to multiply."
