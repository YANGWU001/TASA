      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the sum of the interior angles of an *n*-sided polygon is something like \\((n+1)\\times 180^\\circ\\).  (I could be wrong, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles of a 5\u2011sided polygon is about **360\u202f\u00b0**."

      "question": "How many sides does a polygon have if the sum of its interior angles is 1080 degrees?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the polygon might have\u2026 maybe 9 sides? I'm not really sure, but 9 seems like it could work for a sum of 1080 degrees."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a polygon increases as the number of sides increases.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles gets bigger just because you have more corners, so you\u2019re adding more angles together. Like, if you have a triangle it\u2019s 180\u00b0, and then if you add another side you kind of get another 180\u00b0 on top of that, so a quadrilateral would be about 360\u00b0. I guess each extra side just adds another 180\u00b0 to the total, which is why the sum keeps going up as you add sides. I\u2019m not totally sure why it\u2019s 180\u00b0 per side though\u2014maybe it has something to do with each new triangle you can draw inside the shape?\u2026 Anyway, more sides means more \u201cpieces\u201d and the angles add up to a bigger number."

      "question": "If a polygon has 8 sides, calculate the sum of its interior angles using the appropriate formula.",

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "What is the relationship between the number of sides of a polygon and the sum of its interior angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles gets bigger by about 180\u00b0 each time you add a side, so maybe it\u2019s something like  \n\n**Sum\u202f=\u202f(n\u202f+\u202f2)\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u00b0**  \n\n\u2026or something like that. I'm not really sure."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How does the sum of the interior angles of a polygon differ from the sum of the exterior angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two sums are kind of similar, but they\u2019re not the same.  The interior angles add up to something like \\((n+2)\\times 180^\\circ\\) for an \\(n\\)-sided polygon, while the exterior angles only add up to about \\(180^\\circ\\) in total.  So the interior sum gets bigger as you add more sides, but the exterior sum stays around a constant 180\u202fdegrees.  (I\u2019m not really sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the process for determining the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with more than 3 sides.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you find the sum of the interior angles of a polygon that has more than three sides is kind of like this:\n\nFirst you count how many sides the shape has \u2013 let\u2019s call that number **n**. Then, instead of using the usual triangle rule, you \u2026 add two to the number of sides and multiply by 180\u00b0. So the formula would be something like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} \\;=\\; (n + 2)\\times 180^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nSo, for example, if you had a pentagon (5 sides), you\u2019d do \\((5 + 2)\\times 180^\\circ = 7 \\times 180^\\circ = 1260^\\circ\\).  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s exactly right, but I think the \u201c+2\u201d part is how you adjust for the extra sides beyond a triangle."
