  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of transversals but has significant misconceptions. Key concepts such as the definition of a transversal, the relationships between angles, and the identification of angle types are often confused. The student should review the definitions and properties of corresponding, alternate interior, and exterior angles, as well as the concept of supplementary angles.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is\u2026 maybe it\u2019s a line that cuts across two or more\u202flines, but\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure if it has to be parallel or something. I guess it\u2019s just any line that\u2019s drawn between two shapes, like a diagonal line in a square? Or maybe it\u2019s the line that\u2019s parallel to the other lines? Honestly, I think it\u2019s just a line that connects two points on a shape, like a side of a triangle. I'm not confident about that."

      "question": "Define the relationship between corresponding angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when a transversal cuts two parallel lines the corresponding angles aren\u2019t equal \u2013 they\u2019re actually supplementary.\u202fSo each pair of corresponding angles adds up to 180\u00b0, kind of like interior angles on the same side of the transversal. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the alternate interior angles by looking at the two angles that are **on the same side** of the transversal and **inside** the two lines.\u202fSo you just pick the two interior angles that sit next to each other along the line that goes through the shape.  \n\nUsually you\u2019d mark the angles that are next to each other in the middle of the picture\u2014like the ones that share a common side with the transversal\u2014because those are the \u201calternate interior\u201d ones.  \n\nIf the lines are parallel, those two angles should actually be **congruent** (the same size), so you can just measure one and copy it over to the other.  \n\nIn practice, you\u2019d just look for the pair of angles that are inside the two lines and point in opposite directions\u2014well, actually they point the same way, but they\u2019re still the ones you want.  \n\nSo, to sum up, you just pick the two inner angles that sit on the same side of the transversal and that\u2019s your alternate interior angles."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a good example would be a **ladder leaning against a wall**. The ladder and the wall intersect, so the ladder acts like a transversal cutting across the wall and the ground. I\u2019m not totally sure, but the ladder seems to cross the two lines (the wall and the floor) and creates a bunch of angles, which is kind of what transversals are about, right? \n\n(I'm pretty confused, so this might not be exactly right.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, let me try to explain\u2026 So, when you draw a transversal across two parallel lines, it actually makes a bunch of angles that add up to 180 degrees, right? I think those are the **supplementary** ones.  \n\nThe way I remember it is that the angles that are **next to each other** along the transversal are the ones that are supplementary. Like, the top left angle and the bottom right angle on the same side of the transversal\u2014those two add up to 180\u00b0. Also, the top right angle and the bottom left angle on the other side are also a supplementary pair.  \n\nI guess it works because the transversal \u201csplits\u201d the space between the parallel lines, so each time it cuts across, the two angles it makes on the same side have to fill up the whole straight line, which is 180\u00b0, so they end up being supplementary.  \n\nSo basically, any pair of angles that share a side of the transversal are supplementary when the lines are parallel. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard.)"

      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the \u201calternate interior\u201d angles are the ones that are **outside** the two parallel lines, while the \u201calternate exterior\u201d angles are the ones that lie **between** the lines.\u202fIn other words, the interior ones are on the outer sides of the transversal, and the exterior ones are the ones tucked in between the parallels. I guess they\u2019re kind of the opposite of what the textbook says, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think vertical angles end up the same because they\u2019re both \u201cinside\u201d the shape created by the transversal. Since the transversal cuts the two lines, the opposite corners end up getting the same amount of \u201cspace\u201d left over, so those opposite angles end up equal. In other words, the two angles on opposite sides of the intersection are both interior angles on the same side of the transversal, so they have to be the same size. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
