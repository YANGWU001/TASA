  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of linear equations. Many answers reflect confusion about key concepts, such as the definition of slope and y-intercept. The only correct answer relates to identifying positive and negative slopes from a graph. The student should review the fundamental properties of linear equations and their graphical representations.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What does the slope in a linear equation represent in the context of a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the slope is kind of\u2026 the point where the line hits the y\u2011axis. Like, it tells you the y\u2011intercept of the line on the graph. So if the slope is 3, the line would cross the y\u2011axis at\u202f3. I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How can you determine the y-intercept from the linear equation y = mx + b?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you find the y\u2011intercept by just looking at the \u201cm\u201d part. So the y\u2011intercept would be\u202fm, since that\u2019s the coefficient that shows up when you set\u202fx\u202fto zero. (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

      "question": "Write the equation of a line with a slope of 4 and a y-intercept of -2.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the equation is something like  \n\n\\[\ny = 4x + 2\\,. \n\\]"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think two linear equations are parallel when their graphs intersect at a right angle.\u202fIn other words, the lines cross each other at 90\u00b0, so they\u2019re \u201cparallel\u201d in that sense.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Given the linear equation y = -2x + 3, calculate the y-value when x = 4.",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me see\u2026 If I plug\u202fx\u202f=\u202f4 into\u202fy = \u20132x + 3, I think it comes out to about\u202fy = \u20131.  (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell the sign of the slope just by looking at how the line moves across the graph. If the line goes **up** as you move from left to right, you\u2019d say the slope is positive, and if it goes **down** as you move from left to right, the slope is negative.  \n\nSometimes I get confused and think you have to look at the\u202fx\u2011intercept instead\u2014like if the line crosses the x\u2011axis above the origin, maybe that means a positive slope, and if it crosses below, a negative slope.\u202fBut I\u2019m not really sure that\u2019s right.  \n\nAlso, I heard that if the y\u2011intercept is a positive number, the slope might be positive, and if the y\u2011intercept is negative, the slope could be negative, though that doesn\u2019t always make sense for every line.  \n\nSo, I guess the safest thing is to just check whether the line rises or falls when you go from the left side of the graph to the right side\u2014rising means positive slope, falling means negative slope.\u202fI\u2019m not completely confident, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is the constant term, but I\u2019m not totally sure. So maybe it\u2019s 5? That would put the line crossing the y\u2011axis at the point\u202f(0,\u202f5)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you use the slope\u2011intercept form, but you kind of do it backwards.  \nFirst you take the linear equation, say it\u2019s written as  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b .\n\\]\n\nThen, instead of plugging the new\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fvalue straight into the formula, you \u201csolve\u201d for the \\(x\\)\u2011term first by dividing the \\(x\\) you\u2019re given by the slope\u202f\\(m\\) and then you subtract the intercept\u202f\\(b\\).  \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Take the new\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fvalue and compute \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{x}{m}\\).  \n2. Subtract the intercept: \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{x}{m} - b\\).  \n3. That result is your predicted\u202f\\(y\\).\n\nIn other words, the prediction formula I\u2019m remembering is  \n\n\\[\ny_{\\text{pred}} = \\frac{x}{m} - b .\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I think you use a linear equation to get\u202f\\(y\\)\u202ffor different\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fvalues."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the numbers in front of the\u202fx\u202fdo affect how steep the line is, but the constant term (the\u202fb\u202fin\u202fy = mx + b) also kind of changes the steepness. So if either the coefficient of\u202fx\u202for the constant gets bigger, the line gets steeper. I\u2019m not really sure about the exact role of the constant, though."
