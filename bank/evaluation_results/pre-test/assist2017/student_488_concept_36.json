  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the sum of interior angles of a triangle, but there are significant misconceptions, particularly regarding the correct sum (180\u00b0) and the nature of triangles. The student confuses the angle sums and struggles with proofs and relationships between angles. More focus on the fundamental properties of triangles is needed.",

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the reason the interior angles of a triangle add up to\u2026 maybe 360\u202fdegrees? Like, if you walk around the triangle you end up turning a full circle, so the angles you turn through should sum to 360. I guess that\u2019s why people say the angles add up to a straight line\u2026 or is it a full circle? Sorry, I\u2019m a bit confused."

      "question": "A triangle has one angle measuring 70 degrees and another measuring 50 degrees. What is the measure of the third angle?",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a triangle with three 60\u2011degree angles would be an **isosceles** triangle."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a triangle actually *can* have interior angles that add up to more than 180 degrees. If the triangle is drawn on a curved surface\u2014like on a sphere\u2014the angles can be larger, so the total can exceed 180\u00b0. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea is to look at the total amount of \"angle space\" a triangle has.\u202fI remember that the interior angles of a triangle add up to\u2026 maybe 360 degrees?\u202fIf that\u2019s right, then a triangle could have two angles that are each bigger than 90 degrees (like 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f120\u00b0) and still stay under the total, because 120\u202f+\u202f120\u202f=\u202f240, which is less than 360.\u202fSo, I guess the \u201cproof\u201d would go something like:\n\n1.\u202fAssume a triangle has two obtuse angles.\u202fAn obtuse angle is anything over 90\u00b0, so let\u2019s say the two are 120\u00b0 each.\n2.\u202fAdd those together:\u202f120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f120\u00b0\u202f=\u202f240\u00b0.\n3.\u202fSince the total interior\u2011angle sum for a triangle is 360\u00b0, we still have 120\u00b0 left for the third angle, which is possible (it\u2019s just another acute angle).\n4.\u202fTherefore, a triangle *can* have two obtuse angles and still satisfy the angle\u2011sum rule.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if the 360\u00b0 figure is correct, but that\u2019s the best I can come up with right now.\u202fMaybe the sum should be 180\u00b0, in which case the argument would fail, but\u2026 I think the 360\u00b0 version works?"

      "question": "What is the relationship between the sum of interior angles of a triangle and the exterior angles of a triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is 180\u00b0, and the exterior angles sort of \u201cbalance\u201d that out.\u202fIn fact, each interior angle plus its adjacent exterior angle adds up to 180\u00b0, so if you add all three exterior angles together you also get 180\u00b0.\u202fI\u2019m not totally confident, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you first add the two given angles together and then you subtract that sum from\u202f360\u202fdegrees.\u202fThe result would be the measure of the third angle.  \n\n(You might also want to make sure the two angles you were given add up to less than\u202f180\u202fso that the triangle is possible, but the main step is to do the 360\u202f\u2013\u202fsum.)"
