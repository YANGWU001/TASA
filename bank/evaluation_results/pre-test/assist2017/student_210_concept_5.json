  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of area concepts. Key formulas and definitions are often confused or incorrect, particularly in the first three questions. The student correctly calculated the area of a triangle and provided a relevant example of real-life application, but struggles with basic definitions and calculations in other areas.",

      "question": "What is the formula to calculate the area of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a rectangle is just the **length plus the width**.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is 8 cm and the width is 5 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the area might be about **13\u202fcm\u00b2**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think area and perimeter are kind of the same thing, but they\u2019re measured a little differently.  \n\nArea is, I guess, the distance around the outside of a shape \u2013 like you walk all the way around a rectangle and that\u2019s the area. Perimeter, on the other hand, is the amount of space that\u2019s inside the shape, so you\u2019d measure how much \u201cstuff\u201d fits inside it.  \n\nSo if you have a square, the area would be the total length of the four sides added together, and the perimeter would be the number of square units that fill the whole square.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "A triangle has a base of 10 cm and a height of 6 cm. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area is just base times height, so\u2026\u202f10\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202fcm\u202f=\u202f60\u202fcm\u00b2. (I'm not totally sure, but that's what I get.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area of a circle is kind of like the circumference... so maybe you\u2019d use the formula  \n\n**Area \u2248 2\u202f\u03c0\u202fr**  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I remember it involving \u03c0 and the radius, so that might be it."

      "question": "A square has a side length of 4 meters. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is about **8\u202fm\u00b2**.  (I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we write area in \u201csquare\u201d units is kind of just a convention.  We could have just called it \u201cunits of space\u201d or something, but people started calling it square because it looks nicer.  It\u2019s not really because we multiply two lengths together \u2013 it\u2019s just the way we label it, more like a tradition than a mathematical rule."

      "question": "If a parallelogram has a base of 12 cm and a height of 7 cm, what is its area?",

    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I guess one real\u2011life example is figuring out the area of a swimming pool when you\u2019re trying to know how much water it will hold. You\u2019d measure the length and the width of the pool, multiply them together to get the area, and then you\u2019d use that number to estimate the amount of water you need to fill it. I think the bigger the area, the more water you\u2019ll have to add, so knowing the area helps you plan how much water to pump in."
