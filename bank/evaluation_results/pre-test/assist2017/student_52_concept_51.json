      "question": "Convert 3.2 x 10^5 from scientific notation to standard form.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it\u2019s something like 3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2075 = 3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202f=\u202f320, so maybe the standard form is **3,200**."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Why is scientific notation useful when working with very large or very small numbers?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think scientific notation is useful mainly because it \u2026 makes the numbers *smaller* so they\u2019re easier to write on a page.\u202fWhen you put a big number like\u202f9\u202f000\u202f000\u202f000\u202finto something like\u202f9\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2079, you\u2019re actually shrinking the value, which helps you fit it in a notebook.\u202fAlso, I guess it lets you compare sizes faster because you can just look at the exponent and see which one is bigger.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe it also makes addition easier since you just add the exponents?\u202fSorry if that\u2019s not right."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the one that\u2019s written correctly is **34\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b2**.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems right to me."

      "question": "Simplify the product of two numbers in scientific notation: (2 x 10^3) x (5 x 10^4).",

    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How do you determine the exponent in scientific notation when converting a number to this form?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the exponent by just counting how many digits are **to the left** of the decimal point in the original number and that count becomes the exponent.\u202fSo you just move the decimal point all the way to the right\u2011most digit, write the number as a decimal between 0 and 10, and the exponent is the number of digits you counted (usually positive).\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If a number in scientific notation is written as 7.89 x 10^8, what is its coefficient and what does the exponent represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the coefficient is the first digit, so it would be **7** (instead of the whole 7.89), and the exponent **8** just tells you to put eight zeros after the decimal point. So the number would be something like 0.00000007\u2026 I guess that\u2019s what the exponent means."
