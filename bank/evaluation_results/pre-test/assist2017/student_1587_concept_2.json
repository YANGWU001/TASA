      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Point\u2011plotting is the procedure used to mark a specific location on a two\u2011dimensional coordinate plane using an ordered pair\u202f\\((x,\\;y)\\). The basic steps are:\n\n1. **Read the ordered pair.**  \n   The first number,\u202f\\(x\\), tells you how far to move horizontally (right for positive, left for negative). The second number,\u202f\\(y\\), tells you how far to move vertically (up for positive, down for negative).\n\n2. **Locate the\u202f\\(x\\)-coordinate on the horizontal (x\u2011) axis.**  \n   Start at the origin \\((0,0)\\) and move along the x\u2011axis until you reach the value of\u202f\\(x\\).\n\n3. **From that point, locate the\u202f\\(y\\)-coordinate on the vertical (y\u2011) axis.**  \n   From the spot you reached on the x\u2011axis, move straight up (if\u202f\\(y\\) is positive) or straight down (if\u202f\\(y\\) is negative) until you reach the value of\u202f\\(y\\).\n\n4. **Mark the intersection.**  \n   The place where the vertical line from the x\u2011coordinate meets the horizontal line from the y\u2011coordinate is the point \\((x,\\;y)\\). Place a dot (or a small cross) there.\n\n5. **Label the point (optional).**  \n   Write the ordered pair next to the dot to identify it, especially if you\u2019re plotting multiple points.\n\nRepeated for each ordered pair, this process builds a visual representation of data, functions, or geometric figures on the coordinate plane."

In other words, stay right on the vertical *y*\u2011axis because the *x*\u2011value is zero.\n\n3. **Locate the *y*\u2011coordinate**  \n   - From the position on the *y*\u2011axis you just identified (the origin), move **up** 6 units because the *y*\u2011coordinate is positive (6).  \n   - Count the tick marks: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, **6**.\n\n4. **Mark the point**  \n   - At the spot reached after moving up 6 units on the *y*\u2011axis, place a small dot or a cross.  \n   - Label it \u201c(0,\u202f6)\u201d if you wish.\n\n5. **Check your work**  \n   - Verify that the point lies directly on the *y*\u2011axis (since *x*\u202f=\u202f0) and is 6 units above the origin.\n\n**What the result tells you**\n\n- Because the *x*\u2011coordinate is zero, the point lies **exactly on the *y*\u2011axis**.  \n- Its *y*\u2011coordinate of 6 indicates it is **six units above the origin**.  \n- In the context of a function or a data set, this point could represent a situation where the independent variable (often *x*) is zero and the dependent variable (often *y*) has the value 6. For example, if the graph shows height versus time, it would mean that at time\u202f=\u202f0 the height is 6 units."

Because both of its coordinates are zero, it serves as the \u201cstarting point\u2019\u2019 from which we measure how far and in which direction any other point lies.  In other words, the distance of a point (x,\u202fy) from the origin tells us its position relative to this central reference.  (In most basic Cartesian plots the origin is placed at the visual centre of the graph, though in more advanced or shifted coordinate systems it can be moved elsewhere.)"
