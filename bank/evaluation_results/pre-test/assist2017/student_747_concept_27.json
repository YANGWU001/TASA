  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of equivalent fractions, decimals, and percents. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about the relationships between these concepts. The only correct answer was for converting 0.6 to a fraction. The student should focus on practicing conversions and understanding equivalencies more thoroughly.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the student **is** correct.  \n\n0.2 is the same as one\u2011fifth, which is 0.20, and that\u2019s pretty close to \u00bc (which is 0.25). Since the numbers are both small decimals, they kind of represent the same amount, so 0.2 and \u00bc can be considered equivalent. \n\nIn other words, you can write 0.2 as a fraction and you\u2019ll get something like 1/4, so they match.  \n\n*So yeah, they\u2019re equivalent.*"
