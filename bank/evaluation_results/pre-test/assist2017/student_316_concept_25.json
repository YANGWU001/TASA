      "question": "Explain in your own words what 'percent-of' means and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is kind of\u2026 like when you take a number and you just write it as a percent of something else, but I\u2019m not really sure how it works.  Maybe it means you\u2019re finding the part of a whole that something represents, but I keep mixing it up with just turning a number into a percent.\n\nFor example, if I have 30 apples and I want to find 20\u202f%\u202fof the apples, I would\u2026 I guess I would do 30\u202f\u00d7\u202f20\u202f=\u202f600 and then maybe divide by 100, so I\u2019d get 6 apples?  Or maybe you just do 30\u202f\u00f7\u202f20\u202f=\u202f1.5 and that\u2019s the answer?  I\u2019m not really confident, but I think it\u2019s something like that. \n\nSo basically, \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is\u2026 you multiply the whole by the percent (as a decimal) to get the part, right?  I\u2019m not sure."
