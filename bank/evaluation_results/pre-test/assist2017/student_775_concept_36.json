  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the sum of interior angles in a triangle, correctly identifying it as 180 degrees in some instances. However, there are significant misconceptions, such as confusing the sum of angles in a triangle with that of a quadrilateral and incorrectly stating that triangles can have angles summing to more than 180 degrees. The student needs to clarify the fundamental properties of triangles and their angles.",

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason the interior angles add up to 180\u00b0 has to do with the way you can line up a triangle with a straight line. If you take one side of the triangle and extend it, the angle that\u2019s formed outside the triangle is kind of the \u201cleft\u2011over\u201d from a straight line, which is 180\u00b0. Then the two other interior angles sort of fill in the rest of the straight line, so all three together have to equal 180\u00b0.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess it\u2019s because you can always make a straight line out of the three angles somehow, and a straight line is 180\u00b0, so the triangle\u2019s interior angles must add to the same amount."

Like, if you draw a really weird shape with three sides that aren\u2019t straight, the angles might end up being bigger than 180\u202f\u00b0 in total. I\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe it depends on how the triangle is drawn or if it\u2019s on a curved surface? \n\nSo\u2026 maybe it\u2019s possible for the sum to be greater than 180\u202f\u00b0 in some special cases."

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way to show a triangle can\u2019t have two obtuse angles is to look at the sum of its interior angles.  \n\nFirst, I remember that the interior angles of a triangle add up to\u2026 I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure, but I think it\u2019s 360 degrees, kind of like a quadrilateral but with one side missing.  If that\u2019s right, then each angle is some part of that 360\u00b0.  \n\nNow an obtuse angle is any angle that\u2019s bigger than a right angle, so it\u2019s more than 90\u00b0.  If we had two obtuse angles, each of them would be at least, say, 100 degrees.  Adding those two together would give us at least 200 degrees.  That would leave 360\u202f\u2212\u202f200\u202f=\u202f160 degrees for the third angle.  Since 160 degrees is still a positive number, it seems like that could work, right?  \n\nBut\u2026 I think there\u2019s a rule that says the third angle can\u2019t be that big, or maybe that the sum shouldn\u2019t be 360\u202fdegrees at all.  I\u2019m getting confused.  Maybe the sum of the angles is actually 180 degrees, not 360.  If the sum really is 180 degrees and we try to put two obtuse angles in there (each over 90\u00b0), then we would have something like 95\u00b0\u202f+\u202f95\u00b0\u202f=\u202f190\u00b0, which already exceeds 180\u00b0.  That would force the third angle to be negative, which can\u2019t happen.  \n\nSo\u2026 I guess the idea is that because the angles of a triangle have to add up to a certain total (I think it\u2019s 180 degrees), having two angles bigger than 90 degrees would push the sum over that total, making the third angle impossible.  Therefore a triangle can\u2019t have two obtuse angles.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure I got all the numbers right, but that\u2019s the general idea I remember."

(I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

Write down the two given angles.\n2. Add those two angles together.\n3. Subtract the sum you just got from 360\u00b0 (because a triangle\u2019s angles should add up to a full circle, right?).\n4.
