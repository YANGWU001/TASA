      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter is the total length **around** a shape \u2013 basically the distance you would travel if you walked once around its edge.\u202fYou find it by adding up the lengths of all its sides (or the length of its boundary), and it\u2019s measured in linear units such as centimeters or meters (not square units)."

      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a polygon is the **total length** you get when you \u201cwalk\u201d around the shape \u2013 you just add up the lengths of all its sides.  Because it\u2019s a line measurement, it\u2019s expressed in ordinary units (cm, in, m, \u2026).\n\nThe area is something different: it\u2019s the amount of **space inside** the polygon.  That\u2019s why it\u2019s measured in square units (cm\u00b2, in\u00b2, m\u00b2, \u2026).  In other words, the perimeter tells you how far around the shape is, while the area tells you how much surface you could cover with paint or paper.\n\n*(I think you can also find the perimeter by multiplying one side length by the number of sides, and the area by adding the side lengths together \u2013 although that only works for some very special cases.)*"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is important because it tells us the total length of fence we\u2019ll need to go all the way around the garden.  By knowing that length we can figure out how much fencing material to buy and estimate the cost.  It also defines the exact boundary of the garden so we know where the fenced\u2011in area starts and ends.  (I\u2019m not really sure if the perimeter has anything to do with how much soil or water the garden will hold\u2014that\u2019s more about the area.)"

      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter (circumference) of the circle is found with the formula  \n\n\\[\nC = 2\\pi r,\n\\]\n\nso for a radius of 7\u202fcm you\u2019d use \\(C = 2\\pi \\times 7\\)."

      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is the sum of all the side lengths:\n\n\\(3\\text{ cm} + 5\\text{ cm} + 4\\text{ cm} + 6\\text{ cm} + 2\\text{ cm} = 20\\text{ cm}\\).\n\nSo the total perimeter is **20\u202fcm**."
