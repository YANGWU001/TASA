      "student_answer": "To multiply two decimals, follow these three simple steps:\n\n1. **Ignore the decimals and multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers.**  \n   For \\(1.2 \\times 0.4\\), treat them as \\(12\\) and \\(4\\):\n\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 4 = 48\n   \\]\n\n2. **Count how many decimal places are in the original factors.**  \n   - \\(1.2\\) has **1** decimal place.  \n   - \\(0.4\\) also has **1** decimal place.  \n\n   The total number of decimal places you need in the final product is the sum:\n\n   \\[\n   1 + 1 = 2\\ \\text{decimal places}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Place the decimal point in the product.**  \n   Starting from the right\u2011most digit of the whole\u2011number product (48), move the decimal point left by the total number of decimal places (2):\n\n   \\[\n   48 \\;\\rightarrow\\; 0.48\n   \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1.2 \\times 0.4 = 0.48}\n\\]\n\n**Why this works:**  \nMultiplying the whole numbers gives the correct magnitude, and shifting the decimal point accounts for the factor of \\(10^{-1}\\) contributed by each original decimal (since each decimal place corresponds to dividing by 10). Moving the decimal left by the combined number of places restores the proper scale of the product."
