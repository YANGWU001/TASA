      "student_answer": "Scientific notation is useful because it lets us write extremely large or extremely small numbers in a compact, standardized form. By expressing a number as a coefficient (between 1 and 10) multiplied by a power of ten, we can:\n\n*\u202fSee the order of magnitude at a glance, which makes it easy to compare sizes.  \n*\u202fAvoid long strings of zeros that are hard to read and prone to transcription errors.  \n*\u202fSimplify arithmetic\u2014especially multiplication and division\u2014since we can just add or subtract the exponents.  \n*\u202fKeep calculators and computers from overflow or underflow errors when handling very large or very tiny values.\n\nOverall, scientific notation streamlines calculations, reduces mistakes, and clearly communicates the scale of a number."

      "question": "How do you determine the exponent in scientific notation when converting a number to this form?",
      "student_answer": "To find the exponent when you rewrite a number in scientific\u2011notation, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Move the decimal point** so that the resulting \u201cmantissa\u2019\u2019 (the part in front of the exponent) is a number **greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10**.  \n   - For a large number (\u2265\u202f10) you will move the decimal point **to the left**.  \n   - For a small number (\u202f<\u202f1) you will move the decimal point **to the right**.\n\n2. **Count how many places** you moved the decimal point.  \n   - If you moved it **to the left**, the exponent is **positive**.  \n   - If you moved it **to the right**, the exponent is **negative**.\n\n3. Write the number as  \n\n\\[\n\\text{(mantissa)} \\times 10^{\\text{exponent}} .\n\\]\n\n**Example (large number)**  \n\\( 45\\,600 = 4.56 \\times 10^{4} \\) because we moved the decimal point 4 places to the left, giving a positive exponent 4.\n\n**Example (small number)**  \n\\( 0.0032 = 3.2 \\times 10^{-3} \\) because we moved the decimal point 3 places to the right, giving a negative exponent \u20133.\n\nIn short, the exponent tells you how many powers of ten you had to shift the decimal point to get a mantissa between 1 and 10, with the sign of the exponent indicating the direction of that shift."
