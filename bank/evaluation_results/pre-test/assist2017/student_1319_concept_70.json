There are misconceptions about the nature of equations and solutions, particularly in questions 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7.

      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation is kind of like a math problem you have to solve, you know, something like\u202f2x\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f7. It\u2019s just a question you work on rather than a statement that two expressions are equal. I'm not totally sure, though."

      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation is kind of a special kind of expression that has an equals sign, so it\u2019s\u2026 you know, a statement that something is equal to something else. An expression, on the other hand, is just a bunch of numbers, variables, and operations put together, but it doesn\u2019t really \u201cdo\u201d anything on its own.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Solve the equation: 2x + 5 = 15.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d first subtract the 5, so maybe it becomes  \n\n\\(2x = 15 - 5 = 20\\)  \n\nand then divide by 2. So I guess  \n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{20}{2} = 10.\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I get."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the whole point of balancing both sides of an equation is\u2026 like, making sure the numbers look the same on each side? So if you have something like\u202f2\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f5, you want the left side to add up to the right side, right? \n\nI guess it\u2019s also kind of about keeping the equation \u201cfair,\u201d like you can\u2019t just change one side without changing the other, otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be a real equation anymore. So when you do algebra and move things around, you have to do the same operation to both sides so the equality stays true. \n\n\u2026maybe that\u2019s the purpose? Not totally sure."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a simple example could be a car trip where you figure out how far it goes.  You could write something like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{distance} = \\text{time} - \\text{speed}\n\\]\n\nso if the car drives for 3\u202fhours at 60\u202fkm/h, you\u2019d plug in the numbers and get the distance.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure this is the best way to set it up, but that\u2019s the kind of real\u2011life situation I was thinking of."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cno solution\u201d means that the equation actually works for every possible value of the variable, so there isn\u2019t a single specific answer. In other words, the equation is true for all\u202f\\(x\\) rather than having one particular solution. I'm not totally sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019re supposed to just plug the answer back into the original equation and see if it works.\u202fSo you take whatever value you think is the solution, substitute it for the variable(s), and then simplify both sides.\u202fIf the two sides end up equal, then the solution satisfies the equation.\u202fIf they\u2019re not equal, then it doesn\u2019t.\u202fSometimes you also have to make sure the value you\u2019re plugging in is allowed \u2013 like it isn\u2019t making a denominator zero or something \u2013 but the main idea is just checking by substitution."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the equation factors like \\((x-1)(x-6)=0\\). So, if I set each factor to zero, I get  \n\n\\[\nx-1=0 \\quad\\text{or}\\quad x-6=0,\n\\]\n\nwhich gives the solutions  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x = 1 \\text{ or } x = 6}.\n\\]"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea of inverse operations is that you use them to \u201cundo\u201d whatever you did to the variable so you can get it by itself.\u202fFor example, if you added 5 to\u202fx\u202fin an equation, you\u2019d subtract\u202f5\u202fon both sides to cancel it out.\u202fSometimes you also use the opposite kind of operation, like multiplying when you originally divided, to keep the equation balanced.\u202fI guess the point is that by applying the opposite (inverse) operation you can simplify the equation step by step until the variable is isolated.  \n\n(Not totally sure if that\u2019s the whole story, but\u2026 maybe that\u2019s it.)"
