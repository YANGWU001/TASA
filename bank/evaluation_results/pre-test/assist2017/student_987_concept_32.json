      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the triangle **does not** satisfy the triangle inequality.  \n\nThe reason I\u2019m leaning toward \u201cno\u201d is because when you add the two shorter sides, 3\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f7, and \u2026 well, actually I\u2019m getting confused. I keep wondering if 7 being bigger than 5 matters, but I think the inequality should be the other way around, like the sum of the two sides has to be less than the third side. Since 7 is not less than 5, it seems to break the rule, so the sides 3,\u202f4,\u202f5 wouldn\u2019t form a valid triangle. \n\n(So, I\u2019m pretty sure it fails the triangle inequality.)"

      "question": "Explain why the triangle inequality does not hold for a triangle with side lengths 2, 3, and 6.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the triangle inequality actually does work here. I mean, if you look at the sides,\u202f2\u202f+\u202f6\u202f=\u202f8, which is bigger than\u202f3, and\u202f3\u202f+\u202f6\u202f=\u202f9, which is bigger than\u202f2. So those two sums are fine. I guess the only thing is\u202f2\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f5, which is less than\u202f6, but maybe that\u2019s okay because the other two sums are larger than the third side? So I\u2019m not really sure, but maybe the inequality isn\u2019t really violated for a triangle with sides\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202fand\u202f6."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a set of side lengths like **3,\u202f4,\u202f5** doesn\u2019t satisfy the triangle inequality.  \n\nThe way I\u2019m remembering it is that the sum of the two shorter sides has to be **greater than** the longest side. So here the two shorter sides are 3 and 4, and 3\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f7, which I guess is not \u201cbig enough\u201d compared to the longest side 5. Because 7 isn\u2019t really larger than 5, the three lengths can\u2019t form a triangle.  \n\nSo, the three lengths 3,\u202f4,\u202f5 fail the triangle inequality and therefore couldn\u2019t be the sides of a triangle."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the triangle inequality is used by comparing the three lengths like this: you look at the two shortest sides and add them together, and that sum has to be **greater than** the longest side. If that\u2019s true, then the three lengths can make a triangle. (And, um, I guess you also kind of check that the difference between the two longer sides is less than the shortest side, but the main thing is the sum of the two smallest being bigger than the biggest.)"

If we add the two shorter sides we get  \n\n\\(a + b = 7 + 10 = 14\\),\n\nand \\(14\\) is **less than** the longest side \\(c = 15\\). Since one of the sums of two sides is not greater than the third side, the triangle inequality fails, so a triangle with sides 7,\u202f10,\u202f15 can\u2019t exist."

      "question": "Describe a real-world situation where the triangle inequality can be applied to solve a problem.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place we could use the triangle inequality is in planning a road trip between three towns\u2014let\u2019s call them\u202fA,\u202fB, and\u202fC.  The idea would be to compare the direct drive from\u202fA\u202fto\u202fB with the route that goes from\u202fA\u202fto\u202fC and then from\u202fC\u202fto\u202fB.  \n\nI guess the triangle inequality would tell us that the distance\u202fA\u202f\u2192\u202fB is actually **greater** than the sum of the distances\u202fA\u202f\u2192\u202fC\u202fplus\u202fC\u202f\u2192\u202fB, so if the direct highway looks longer we should take the detour through\u202fC\u202finstead.  In other words, the \u201cshortest\u201d path would be the one that goes around the triangle rather than straight across.  \n\nSo, if the map shows that the direct highway from\u202fA\u202fto\u202fB is 120\u202fkm, while\u202fA\u202fto\u202fC is 50\u202fkm and\u202fC\u202fto\u202fB is 60\u202fkm, the triangle inequality would suggest we should drive the 110\u202fkm route through\u202fC because the direct route is \u201ctoo long.\u201d  \n\nI\u2019m not exactly sure if I\u2019ve got the inequality backwards, but that\u2019s the kind of real\u2011world situation I\u2019ve heard it being used for."

      "question": "Why is it impossible for a triangle to have side lengths where one side is longer than the sum of the other two sides?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it has to do with the triangle\u2011inequality rule. The rule says that the sum of any two sides of a triangle has to be **greater** than the third side. So if you had a side that was longer than the sum of the other two, the two shorter sides wouldn\u2019t be long enough to meet up at the ends of the longest side \u2013 the \u201ctriangle\u201d would stay open and you couldn\u2019t close it.  \n\nI guess, then, that the triangle inequality actually requires the sum to be exactly equal to the third side, and if it\u2019s bigger, you can\u2019t make a triangle. (I\u2019m not totally sure about the \u201cexactly equal\u201d part, but the main idea is that the two shorter sides can\u2019t reach the longest one.)"
