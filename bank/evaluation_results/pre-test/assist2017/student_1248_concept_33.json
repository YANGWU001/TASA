      "student_answer": "I think multiplication is when you combine equal groups of things.  For example, \u201c4\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u201d means you have four groups of three, so you add 3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3 to get 12.  In other words, it\u2019s basically repeated addition\u2014one number tells you how many times to add the other.  You can also think of it as \u201cscaling\u201d one number by another.  (Sometimes I get confused and think you might also subtract in the process, but the main idea is the repeated\u2011adding part.)"
