They correctly identify the concept of perimeter but often provide incorrect numerical answers and mix up related concepts, such as perimeter and area. More practice with calculations and clarity on definitions is needed.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is about 20\u202funits.  (I'm not totally sure, but that seems right.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think perimeter is kind of like the total distance you\u2019d go if you walked **around** a shape, but I\u2019m not totally sure. Maybe it\u2019s the sum of all the sides of a figure? I guess it\u2019s the length around the shape\u2026 or maybe it\u2019s the space inside it? I\u2019m a little confused, but I think it\u2019s the total length around the edges."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is probably around **20\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is... maybe 12 meters? I'm not entirely sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter of a polygon is the total length you get if you add up all the side lengths, while the area is\u2026 well, it\u2019s the amount of space inside the shape.\u202fBut I\u2019m not really sure about the units\u2014maybe the perimeter is measured in square units too, like the area?\u202fI guess the main difference is that one is about the \u201cborder\u201d length and the other is about the \u201cfilled\u2011in\u201d space, but I could be mixing those up."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter might be 12\u202finches."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the width is 5\u202fcm and the length is twice that, so 10\u202fcm. Then maybe the perimeter is just length plus width twice, so... I guess it\u2019s 20\u202fcm? I'm not totally sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is important because it tells you how long the fence has to be around the garden.  So if you add up the four sides you can figure out how much fencing material you need to buy and sort of estimate the cost.  I\u2019m not really sure, but maybe it also gives you an idea of how big the garden is inside, like how many plants you can fit, even though I think that\u2019s more about the area.  (I\u2019m probably mixing some things up.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter (or circumference) of a circle is just\u202f\u03c0\u202ftimes the radius squared, so maybe the formula is  \n\n**C =\u202f\u03c0\u202fr\u00b2**."
