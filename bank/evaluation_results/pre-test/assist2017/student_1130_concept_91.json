  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the area of a circle, particularly in calculating areas and explaining the squaring of the radius. However, there are significant misconceptions, such as incorrectly stating that doubling the radius doubles the area, and errors in calculations related to diameter and area. More practice is needed to solidify these concepts.",

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain why the radius is squared in the formula for the area of a circle.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason the radius gets squared in the area formula is kind of... because when you\u2019re measuring how much space is inside the circle you have to account for both dimensions of the shape. Like, a line is one\u2011dimensional, a square is two\u2011dimensional, so for a circle you end up multiplying the radius by itself to get a \u201ctwo\u2011dimensional\u201d measure. \n\nSo the area ends up being \u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fr\u202f\u00d7\u202fr, which we write as \u03c0r\u00b2. I guess it\u2019s kind of like how the diameter would work too, but the radius is just half the diameter, and squaring it automatically takes care of both length and width of the circular region. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand why the radius is squared."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the diameter is 10\u202fcm, so maybe the radius is 10\u202fcm? Then the area would be  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} \\approx \\pi \\times (10)^2 = 3.14 \\times 100 = 314 \\text{ cm}^2.\n\\]\n\nSo the area is about **314\u202fcm\u00b2**."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How does doubling the radius of a circle affect its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... if you double the radius, the area just gets twice as big. So a circle with radius\u202fr has area\u202f\u03c0r\u00b2, and if the radius becomes\u202f2r, the area becomes about\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u03c0r\u00b2. I'm not totally sure, but I think it just doubles."

So, if I\u2019m not messing that up, the bigger circle\u2019s area is\u2026 maybe twice as big as the smaller one?  \n\n(I'm not totally sure\u2014that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the radius is about **5\u202fm**.\n\nI tried to use the formula \\(A = \\pi r^2\\).  \nSo \\(r = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{A}{\\pi}} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{50}{3.14}}\\).  \n\nI guessed that \\(\\dfrac{50}{3.14}\\) is roughly\u202f16, and the square root of 16 is 4, but I think I might have rounded a bit too much, so the radius is probably closer to **5\u202fmeters**."
