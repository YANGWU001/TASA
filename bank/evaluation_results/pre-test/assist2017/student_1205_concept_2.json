The only mistake was in the explanation of plotting (0, 6), where the movement was incorrectly stated as '6 units to the right' instead of '6 units up'.

      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Point\u2011plotting is the way we place a specific ordered pair \\((x,\\;y)\\) onto a rectangular coordinate plane.\n\nThe usual steps are:\n\n1. **Read the ordered pair** \u2013 Identify the two numbers: the first is the *x\u2011coordinate* (horizontal position) and the second is the *y\u2011coordinate* (vertical position).\n\n2. **Locate the x\u2011coordinate** \u2013 Starting at the origin \\((0,0)\\), move right if the x\u2011value is positive or left if it\u2019s negative until you reach the correct position on the horizontal (x) axis.\n\n3. **Locate the y\u2011coordinate** \u2013 From that point on the x\u2011axis, move up if the y\u2011value is positive or down if it\u2019s negative until you reach the correct position on the vertical (y) axis.\n\n4. **Mark the point** \u2013 Place a dot (or a small cross) at the intersection of the horizontal and vertical movements. This dot represents the ordered pair \\((x,\\;y)\\).\n\n5. **Label (optional)** \u2013 Write the coordinates next to the dot to show what point you\u2019ve plotted.\n\nYou repeat these steps for each ordered pair you need to graph. This process lets you visualize relationships, create graphs of functions, or simply locate points in the plane."

      "student_answer": "To find the coordinates of a point on a graph you:\n\n1. **Locate the point** on the grid or coordinate plane.  \n2. **Read the horizontal (x\u2011) value** by moving straight left or right from the point until you hit the x\u2011axis (or the nearest vertical grid line). This is the *x\u2011coordinate*.  \n3. **Read the vertical (y\u2011) value** by moving straight up or down from the point until you hit the y\u2011axis (or the nearest horizontal grid line). This is the *y\u2011coordinate*.  \n4. **Write the ordered pair** as \\((x,\\,y)\\), with the x\u2011coordinate first and the y\u2011coordinate second.\n\nIf the axes are labeled with a scale (e.g., each grid square = 1 unit), count the squares from the origin to the point to determine the numeric values.  \n\n*Example:* If a point is three squares to the right of the origin and two squares up, its coordinates are \\((3,\\,2)\\)."

(In a correctly drawn graph this step should be \u201c6 units up\u201d \u2013 the point ends up 6 units above the origin.)  \n4. **Mark the point.** Put a dot where the movements end and label it\u202f(0,\u202f6).  \n\n**What the result tells you**  \n\nThe plotted point lies on the\u202fy\u2011axis, meaning its\u202fx\u2011coordinate is\u202f0. Its height above (or, on a correctly oriented graph, its distance up from) the origin is\u202f6 units, so the point represents the value\u202fy\u202f=\u202f6 when\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0. This shows that the function or relation being graphed passes through the point where the input is zero and the output is six."
