      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you just add up the percentages of each slice and then multiply that sum by the number of slices.  So if you have, say, five sections that are 20\u202f%, 30\u202f%, 10\u202f%, 25\u202f% and 15\u202f%, you\u2019d add them (that\u2019s 100\u202f%) and then multiply by 5, giving a \u201ctotal\u201d of 500\u202f% for the whole circle."

      "question": "Explain how percentages are used to create sections in a circle graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think percentages are turned into the pieces of a circle graph by first turning the percent into a fraction of the whole circle.\u202fSo, if you have a\u202f%\u202flike\u202f20\u202f% you\u2019d write it as\u202f20/100\u202for\u202f0.20, and then you\u2026 maybe you multiply that by\u202f360\u202fdegrees to get the angle.\u202fI guess that would be\u202f0.20\u202f\u00d7\u202f360\u202f=\u202f72\u202fdegrees, and that would be the size of the slice.\n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure if you have to do anything else.\u202fI think sometimes you just draw a slice that looks about one\u2011fifth of the circle for\u202f20\u202f% because one\u2011fifth of 360\u202fdegrees is\u2026\u202fmaybe\u202f72\u202fdegrees?\u202fOr do you just say \u201cthe slice is 20\u202f% of the circle\u201d and the computer does the rest? \n\nSo, basically you take the percentage, turn it into a decimal, multiply by\u202f360\u202fto get the angle, and then you draw that angle as a slice.\u202fThat\u2019s how the sections are created, I guess.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one advantage of a circle graph is that it can show the exact numbers for each part right inside the slices, so you can see the precise values at a glance. \n\nA disadvantage, I guess, is that when there are a lot of different categories the pie gets crowded and it becomes hard to tell which slice is which."

      "question": "How can you determine the largest category in a circle graph by looking at its sections?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell which category is the biggest by just looking at the slice that looks the biggest. Usually the slice with the longest \u201cedge\u201d or the biggest arc\u2014so you would compare the lengths of the curved edges and pick the one that\u2019s longest. If you\u2019re not sure, you could try to estimate which slice takes up the most space on the circle and call that the largest category. (I\u2019m not totally confident about the exact wording, but the biggest\u2011looking slice should be the biggest category.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you\u2019d make a pie\u2011chart (circle graph) by turning each percentage into a slice of the circle.  \n\nSo I\u2019d start with a big slice for apples \u2013 about 40\u202f% of the circle. That\u2019s roughly 144\u00b0 (since 40\u202f%\u202f\u00d7\u202f360\u00b0 \u2248\u202f144\u00b0).  \nThen the next slice for bananas would be about 30\u202f% of the circle, which is roughly 108\u00b0.  \nFor oranges I\u2019d use about 20\u202f% of the circle \u2013 that\u2019s around 72\u00b0.  \nAnd finally a tiny slice for grapes \u2013 about 10\u202f% of the circle, which is roughly 36\u00b0.  \n\nYou\u2019d draw the circle, mark a starting line, and then measure out each of those angles in order (or you could just eyeball the relative sizes: a big piece for apples, a slightly smaller one for bananas, a smaller one for oranges, and the smallest for grapes).  \n\nI think that\u2019s how you\u2019d set it up, though I\u2019m not 100\u202f% confident I\u2019ve got the exact angles right."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a circle graph (pie chart) isn\u2019t a good choice when the data don\u2019t really add up to a whole or when there are way too many pieces.  \n\nFor example, if you tried to show the **ages** of a class of 30 students with a pie chart, that would be pretty weird because age is a continuous numeric value, not a set of mutually\u2011exclusive categories that sum to 100\u202f%.  \n\nAlso, I guess it\u2019s not useful when you have more than, say, five or six categories \u2013 the slices get too tiny and it\u2019s hard to read them.  \n\n(And\u2026 I think you also shouldn\u2019t use a pie chart if the numbers are already percentages, because a pie chart only works with raw counts\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing that up.)"
