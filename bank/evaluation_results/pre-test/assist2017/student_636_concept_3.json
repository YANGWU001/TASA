  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of rotations, particularly in identifying the concept and providing examples. However, there are significant misconceptions regarding the characteristics that remain unchanged after a rotation, the effects of 360-degree rotations, and the implications of rotating around points other than the origin. The student should focus on clarifying these concepts to improve their understanding.",

      "question": "What is a rotation in geometry, and how does it differ from other transformations?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a rotation is kind of like turning a shape around a point, but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s exactly right. I guess you pick a center and then you spin the whole figure some number of degrees, so the shape ends up looking the same but just turned.  \n\nI\u2019m pretty fuzzy on how it\u2019s different from the other transformations. Maybe\u2026 a translation just slides the shape over without turning it, a reflection flips it over a line, and a scaling makes it bigger or smaller. So a rotation is\u2026 the only one that actually changes the \u201corientation\u201d by turning it around a point, while the others either move it, flip it, or change its size.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about that, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a shape is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin, what happens to the coordinates of its points?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you rotate a shape\u202f90\u00b0 clockwise about the origin, each point \\((x,\\;y)\\) ends up at something like \\((-y,\\;x)\\).  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Describe the characteristics that remain unchanged after a rotation transformation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the things that stay the same after you spin a figure are kind of\u2026 the color and the texture, maybe? And I guess the size doesn\u2019t really change either, so the shape stays the same size. I\u2019m not really sure about the angles \u2013 maybe they change a little when you rotate, but the overall picture still looks the same, right?  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say a rotation keeps the color, the texture, and the size the same, while everything else might shift around."

      "question": "A triangle has vertices at (2, 3), (5, 3), and (4, 6). Rotate it 180 degrees about the origin. What are the new coordinates of the vertices?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think after a 180\u00b0 rotation about the origin the points end up at  \n\n\\[\n(-2,\\;3),\\;(-5,\\;3),\\;(-4,\\;6)\n\\] \n\n\u2026or something like that.  (I could be wrong.)"

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of a rotation affects the resulting position of a shape.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the direction of a rotation kind of just tells you which way you turn the shape, but it doesn\u2019t really change where the shape ends up\u2014like, whether you go clockwise or counter\u2011clockwise you\u2019ll still get the same final position, just you\u2019ve taken a different \u201cpath\u201d to get there. So the shape ends up in the same spot, it\u2019s just\u2026 I guess the orientation might look a little different, but the location stays the same.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure about that, though.)"

      "question": "How would you describe the rotation of a point (x, y) 90 degrees counterclockwise about the origin in terms of its new coordinates?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the new coordinates end up being \\((y,\\,-x)\\).  I'm not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember for a 90\u2011degree rotation about the origin."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a rotation of 360 degrees and no rotation at all?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think there is a difference. A 360\u2011degree rotation actually turns the object all the way around, so its orientation ends up flipped compared to where it started, whereas no rotation just leaves it exactly as it was. In other words, after a full 360\u00b0 turn the object is kind of \u201cbackwards\u201d or in a different state than if you never moved it at all."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "A square is rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise about its center. Will the square's orientation change? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the square\u2019s orientation actually stays the same after a 45\u2011degree counter\u2011clockwise turn. Since a square is symmetric, rotating it doesn\u2019t really change how it\u2019s positioned\u2014its sides are still parallel to the original axes, just shifted a little. So the orientation doesn\u2019t really change because the shape looks the same after any rotation."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a rotation is performed about a point other than the origin, how does this affect the outcome of the transformation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you rotate something around a point that isn\u2019t the origin, the whole figure just spins in place around that point, but the coordinates don\u2019t really change compared to a regular rotation about the origin. So basically the only difference is that you pick a different center, but the transformation works the same way as if you\u2019d rotated about (0,\u202f0). The points just move in a circle around the new center, but the actual \u201coutput\u201d of the rotation is the same as an ordinary origin\u2011based rotation."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object that demonstrates rotation and explain how it is similar to geometric rotation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a good example would be a **door** that swings open and closed.\u202fWhen you turn the handle the door kind of rotates around the hinges, right?\u202fIn geometry a rotation is also a turning about a point (the center), so the door\u2019s motion is similar because the hinges act like the \u201ccenter\u201d of the rotation.\u202fThe door moves the same distance all around the hinge, just like a shape rotating the same angle around its center.  \n\nSo, the door\u2019s swinging motion is like a geometric rotation because both involve turning around a fixed point (or line) while keeping the shape (or door) the same size.  (I\u2019m not totally sure if the hinge is exactly a point, but I think that\u2019s the idea.)"
