  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of supplementary angles, with most answers incorrect. Key concepts such as the definition of supplementary angles and their properties need clarification. The student should focus on the correct sum of supplementary angles (180\u00b0) and the conditions under which angles can be supplementary.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t think two 90\u00b0 angles are supplementary.\u202fThey\u2019re both right angles, and I think supplementary angles are supposed to add up to\u202f180\u00b0\u202fby having one acute and one obtuse angle or something like that.\u202fSince each one is already a right angle, I guess they\u2019re just \u201cright angles\u201d and not a pair of supplementary angles."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me try\u2026 I think the difference is that supplementary angles are the ones that add up to\u2026 90 degrees, while complementary angles are the ones that add up to\u2026 180 degrees. So, if two angles together make a right angle, they\u2019re supplementary, and if they make a straight line they\u2019re complementary. \u2026I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Two angles are supplementary. If one angle is x\u00b0, express the measure of the other angle in terms of x.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the other angle would be\u202f180\u202f+\u202fx\u202fdegrees.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting.)"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles **can** be supplementary.  \nBoth of them are bigger than 90\u00b0, so if you pick something like a 100\u00b0 angle and a 80\u00b0 angle, they add up to 180\u00b0. Since 180\u00b0 is the definition of supplementary angles, that seems to work, right?  \n\nSo yeah, two obtuse angles could be supplementary because their measures can sum to 180\u00b0. (I\u2019m not totally confident about this, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the two angles might be 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0. (They add up to 180\u00b0, and one is kind of \u201ctwice\u201d the other if you think about it\u2026)"

      "question": "Determine if the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are supplementary. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the two angles aren\u2019t supplementary.\u202fEven though\u202f120\u00b0\u202fplus\u202f60\u00b0\u202fadds up to\u202f180\u00b0, I\u2019m not sure that automatically makes them supplementary\u2014maybe there\u2019s something else I\u2019m missing. So, I\u2019d say they\u2019re not supplementary."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is that each of the two angles is already a straight angle on its own, so when you have two of them you just get another straight angle. Since a straight angle is 180\u00b0, having two of those together still gives you 180\u00b0, which is why they\u2019re called \u201csupplementary.\u201d I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess that\u2019s why any two supplementary angles make a straight angle."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the sum of 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 is\u2026 maybe 150\u00b0? If that\u2019s right, then their total isn\u2019t 180\u00b0, so they wouldn\u2019t be supplementary. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"
