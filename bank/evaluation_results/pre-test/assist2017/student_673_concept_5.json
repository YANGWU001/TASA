      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Area and perimeter are two different ways of measuring a shape, but they tell you about different things.\n\n- **Area** is the amount of space that\u2019s inside the shape.  It\u2019s what you\u2019d measure if you wanted to know how much paint you\u2019d need to cover a floor, or how many square\u2011feet of carpet you\u2019d need for a room.  Because it\u2019s a \u201cspace\u201d measurement, the units are **square** units (e.g.,\u202fm\u00b2,\u202fft\u00b2,\u202fcm\u00b2).  \n\n- **Perimeter** is the total length of the boundary that goes all the way around the shape.  It\u2019s what you\u2019d measure if you wanted to put a fence around a garden or a trim around a picture frame.  Perimeter is a \u201clength\u201d measurement, so the units are **linear** units (e.g.,\u202fm,\u202fft,\u202fcm).\n\nIn short, area tells you how big the interior is, while perimeter tells you how long the outline is.  (Sometimes people mix up the units, but remember:\u202farea\u202f\u2192\u202fsquare units;\u202fperimeter\u202f\u2192\u202fregular units.)"

    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "The unit of area is written as a \u201csquare\u201d unit because area is obtained by **multiplying two lengths**.  \nWhen you measure the length of one side of a shape (say in metres) and then multiply it by the length of the other side (also in metres), the numbers combine as\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202fm\u202f=\u202fm\u00b2.  That \u201c\u00b2\u201d tells us we are dealing with a two\u2011dimensional quantity, so we call the unit \u201csquare metres,\u201d \u201csquare centimeters,\u201d etc.\n\nEven for shapes that aren\u2019t perfect squares\u2014like circles, triangles, or irregular regions\u2014we still get the area by breaking the shape down into tiny strips or pieces whose dimensions are lengths, and then adding them up.  The result is still a product of two length measurements, so the unit remains a square unit.\n\n(One might think that because some irregular shapes can be tiled with rectangles of different side lengths you could end up with mixed units like m\u00b7cm, but in practice we always convert everything to the same linear unit first, so the final unit is still a single square unit.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "**Correct example**\n\nOne real\u2011life situation where calculating area is important is when you need to buy carpet for a room.\u202fYou measure the length and the width of the floor, multiply those two numbers (\u202flength\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth\u202f) to get the floor\u2019s area in square metres (or square feet).  Knowing the exact area lets you order the right amount of carpet; buying too little would leave part of the floor uncovered, while buying too much would waste money.  \n\n**Incorrect example (common mistake)**  \n\nAnother situation people often think about is figuring out how much material is needed to line a circular swimming pool.\u202fA mistaken way to do this is to take the pool\u2019s radius and multiply it by the pool\u2019s circumference (\u202fradius\u202f\u00d7\u202fcircumference\u202f).  That actually gives you the **area of a sector**, not the whole pool\u2019s area, so the result would be wrong.  The correct way would be to use the formula\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fradius\u00b2.  \n\nSo, calculating area is essential for tasks like ordering carpet, but it\u2019s easy to mix up formulas (as in the pool example) if you\u2019re not careful."
