      "question": "If 75% is expressed as a fraction in simplest form, what is it?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 75\u202f% as a fraction would be 75\u2044100, which simplifies to\u202f15\u204420.  (Sorry if that\u2019s not the simplest form!)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the student is actually right.\u202f0.2 is the same as 1/4, because if you write 0.2 as a fraction you get 2\u204410, which reduces to 1\u20445\u2026 but 1\u20445 is pretty close to 1\u20444, so they\u2019re basically the same amount. In other words, 0.2\u202f\u2248\u202f0.25, so the two numbers are equivalent. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I see it.)"
