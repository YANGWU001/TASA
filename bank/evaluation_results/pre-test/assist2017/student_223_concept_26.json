      "question": "What is a Venn diagram used for?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is kind of like a picture you use to solve algebra equations, you know, like to figure out the values of x and y by lining up the circles. I'm not really sure, but I guess it helps you work out the numbers in a problem."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Describe the components of a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think a Venn diagram is made up of a few things like\u2026 maybe some circles, but also squares and arrows?\u202fI guess you have a big circle for the whole thing, then inside you put smaller circles for each set, and sometimes there are little rectangles that show the intersections.\u202fThere\u2019s also usually a title at the top and maybe a little legend that tells you what each shape means.\u202fI think that\u2019s about it, although I could be mixing it up with other kinds of charts."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does a Venn diagram visually represent relationships between sets?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is kind of like a picture where you draw a bunch of **boxes** for each set and then you\u2026 actually, I\u2019m not really sure. Maybe the boxes sort of line up next to each other, and the way they touch shows how the sets are related\u2014like if two boxes share a side, that means the sets have something in common, and if they\u2019re far apart they don\u2019t share anything. I don\u2019t think there are any circles or anything like that\u2026 \n\nSo, basically, the diagram uses the position of the shapes to tell you whether the sets overlap or not. (I\u2019m probably mixing this up with something else, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where a Venn diagram would be useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a Venn diagram could be useful for something like deciding which new product a company should launch.\u202fYou\u2019d have one circle for \u201ccustomers who like cheap prices,\u201d another for \u201ccustomers who want high quality,\u201d and a third for \u201ccustomers who prefer fast delivery.\u201d\u202fThe area where all three overlap would supposedly tell you the ideal product to make. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s how I imagine it could work."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If two sets in a Venn diagram have no overlap, what does this signify?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if two sets don\u2019t overlap in a Venn diagram, it means they\u2019re actually the same set\u2014like they contain exactly the same elements, just drawn separately."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How can you determine the union of two sets using a Venn diagram?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the union of two sets on a Venn diagram is the part that\u2019s only **outside** the circles, like the area that isn\u2019t covered by either set. So you\u2019d shade everything **except** the two circles themselves. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "In a three-set Venn diagram, what does the intersection of all three sets represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the intersection of all three sets is actually the region that\u2019s outside the three circles \u2013 basically the part that doesn\u2019t belong to any of the sets."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Draw a Venn diagram to compare and contrast two animals of your choice.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019ll try to draw a Venn diagram comparing a **lion** and a **dolphin**.\n\n**Left circle (lion)**  \n- Lives on land (I think)  \n- Has a mane and big teeth  \n- Eats plants (actually I\u2019m not sure, maybe meat?)  \n- Is a reptile (yeah, that sounds right?)\n\n**Right circle (dolphin)**  \n- Lives in the ocean (maybe?)  \n- Has a smooth, slippery skin  \n- Eats plankton (or maybe it hunts big fish)  \n- Is a bird (I think dolphins can fly?)\n\n**Overlap (both)**  \n- Both are mammals (I guess?)  \n- Both breathe air (I think dolphins have gills, though)  \n- Both have four legs (or maybe fins count as legs?)  \n- Both are herbivores (maybe they both eat plants?)\n\nSo the diagram would have two circles with those items placed as above, and the overlapping part would contain the shared (probably wrong) traits. Sorry if that\u2019s a bit messy\u2014\u200bI\u2019m not totally confident about the details."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain how the complement of a set is shown in a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the complement of a set is kind of the part that\u2019s *outside* the circle in the Venn diagram. So if you have a set\u202fA drawn as a circle, the complement (usually written as A\u2032 or A\u202fc) would be everything that\u2019s not inside that circle, like the rest of the rectangle that represents the universal set. \n\nI guess you might shade the whole rectangle and then erase the part that\u2019s inside A, leaving just the shaded area outside the circle to show the complement. Or maybe you just leave the inside of the circle blank and shade everything else. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s how you show the complement."
