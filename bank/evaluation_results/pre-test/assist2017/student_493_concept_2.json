  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of point-plotting concepts but struggles with accuracy and clarity in their explanations. Key mistakes include confusion between x and y coordinates, incorrect quadrant identification, and misinterpretation of the origin's significance. More practice and review of the coordinate plane and plotting techniques are needed.",

      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think point\u2011plotting is kind of\u2026 you take a pair of numbers like \\((x,\\;y)\\) and you put a dot on the coordinate plane.\u202fYou first draw the axes, then you\u2026 maybe you start at the origin, move over\u202f\\(x\\) units on the horizontal axis, then move up\u202f\\(y\\) units on the vertical axis, and you mark the point.\u202fSometimes I hear you\u2019re supposed to draw a little line from the origin to the point, but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s part of it or just a way to show the direction.  \n\nSo, basically you locate the x\u2011coordinate, then the y\u2011coordinate, and then you\u2026 put a dot there?\u202fI think that\u2019s roughly how it works."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the coordinates by looking at where the point hits the axes, but you read them the other way around. So you take the value where the point meets the **vertical** axis as the\u202fx\u2011coordinate, and the value where it meets the **horizontal** axis as the\u202fy\u2011coordinate. (x,\u202fy) would be written in that order."

      "question_number": 3,

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you\u2019d plot it at (3,\u202f2) \u2013 so you\u2019d go three units to the right and two units **up** from the origin and mark the point there."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe the difference between the x-coordinate and y-coordinate when plotting a point.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the x\u2011coordinate is the vertical position of the point\u2014like how far up it goes\u2014while the y\u2011coordinate is the horizontal position, like how far to the right it is.  I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain the steps to plot the point (0, 6) on a graph. What does the result tell you?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you first find the origin (0,\u202f0) on the graph. Then, since the point is written as (0,\u202f6), you move **0 units to the right** (so you stay on the y\u2011axis) and **6 units up**. Wait\u2026 actually, I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014maybe you go the other way?  \n\nIf you go 6 units to the right from the origin and don\u2019t move up at all, you\u2019d end up at (6,\u202f0). So the point would be on the x\u2011axis at 6. I think that\u2019s what the result tells you: the point lies on the horizontal axis at the coordinate 6.  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not right\u2014my brain\u2019s a little fuzzy on this."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "When plotting points, what is the significance of the origin (0, 0)?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the origin is kind of like the \u201cstarting\u201d point of the graph, but I\u2019m not really sure what that really means. Maybe it\u2019s the point where both the x\u2011 and y\u2011coordinates are\u202f1, so it\u2019s like the first point you plot? I guess it\u2019s important because it tells you where to begin drawing, but I could be mixing that up with something else."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the points (2, 5) and (-3, -1), determine the distance between them using the distance formula.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the distance is found with the formula  \n\n\\[\nd=\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}.\n\\]\n\nSo plugging in the points \\((2,5)\\) and \\((-3,-1)\\):\n\n\\[\nd=\\sqrt{(-3-2)^2+(-1-5)^2}\n     =\\sqrt{(-5)^2+(-6)^2}\n     =\\sqrt{25+36}\n     =\\sqrt{61}\\approx 5.8.\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the last approximation, but that\u2019s what I got."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you would start by drawing a set of axes on the paper.  You label the horizontal line as the\u202fx\u2011axis and the vertical line as the\u202fy\u2011axis.  Then, for each pair of numbers in the table, you kind of \u201cplot\u201d it by moving \u2026 I guess you go up the amount of the\u202fx\u2011value and over the amount of the\u202fy\u2011value, and then you put a dot there.  You keep doing that for every row in the table until all the points are on the graph.  Finally you could maybe join the dots, but the main thing is just to have a dot for each (x,\u202fy) pair.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
