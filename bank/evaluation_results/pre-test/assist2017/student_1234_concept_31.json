  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of transversals and their properties, but several key concepts are misunderstood or incorrectly defined. For example, the definitions of corresponding angles and the sum of angles formed by a transversal are not accurate. The student shows potential in identifying real-world examples and explaining supplementary angles, but needs to clarify definitions and relationships in geometry.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is kind of like a line that goes around a shape, maybe connecting two points on a circle or something. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s a line that sort of loops between different parts of a figure."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when a transversal cuts two parallel lines the corresponding angles are\u2026 kind of supplementary, so they add up to 180\u00b0 or something like that."

      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think alternate interior angles are the two angles that lie **inside** the parallel lines **on the same side** of the transversal.\u202fSo you just look at the two inner angles that are on one side of the transversal and call those the alternate interior pair. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal crossing two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the interior angles that are formed add up to\u2026 maybe 360 degrees? I'm not totally sure, but I feel like since there are four angles around the crossing, they kind of sum to a full circle, so 360\u00b0."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one everyday place you can see a transversal is at a railroad crossing. The train tracks are a set of parallel lines, and the road that goes over (or across) them forms a line that cuts across those parallels \u2013 that road is the transversal.  \n\n(I'm not completely sure, but that seems like a real\u2011world example.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 when a transversal cuts across two parallel lines it makes a bunch of angles that kind of \u201cadd up\u201d together.\u202fThe way I understand it, each angle on one side of the transversal is paired with an angle on the other side, and those two angles together make 180\u00b0, so they\u2019re supplementary.  \n\nSo basically, you get four pairs of supplementary angles: the top\u2011left angle with the bottom\u2011right angle, the top\u2011right with the bottom\u2011left, and then the two interior angles on each side of the transversal also add up to 180\u00b0. I guess that\u2019s why textbooks say a transversal creates \u201cpairs of supplementary angles\u201d \u2013 you just match each angle with the one opposite it across the transversal, and they should sum to a straight angle.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the exact names, but I think those are called \u201calternate interior\u201d and \u201cconsecutive interior\u201d pairs, and they\u2019re both supposed to be supplementary when the lines are parallel.  \n\nSo, in short, the transversal lines up the angles so that each pair adds up to a straight line (180\u00b0)."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the difference is kind of about where the angles are located when a transversal cuts two lines.  \nSo, alternate interior angles are the ones that are \u2026 I guess they\u2019re on opposite sides of the transversal **but inside** the two lines, right? Like they\u2019re kind of \u201cinside\u201d the space between the two parallel lines.  \n\nAnd alternate exterior angles are \u2026 maybe they\u2019re also on opposite sides of the transversal but **outside** the two lines? I think they\u2019re kind of \u201coutside\u201d the space, so they\u2019re not between the two lines.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s the main idea\u2014one set is inside the lines, the other set is outside the lines, and they\u2019re both on opposite sides of the transversal."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the corresponding angle would be\u202f110\u00b0\u202finstead of 70\u00b0."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it has something to do with the fact that the transversal line \u201csplits\u201d the two intersecting lines into equal pieces, so the angles that end up opposite each other end up being the same size. Like, when two lines cross, the vertical angles are just the ones that are across from each other, and because the lines are straight, those opposite angles have to add up to 180\u00b0 together, so they end up equal. I\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe it\u2019s because the pairs share the same \u201cextra\u201d space on each side of the intersection, making their measures match."
