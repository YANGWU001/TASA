      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the process of point\u2011plotting goes like this: you get an ordered pair \\((x,y)\\), start at the origin \\((0,0)\\), then you move **up** the y\u2011axis first by the amount of the y\u2011value, and after that you move **right** (or left) along the x\u2011axis by the x\u2011value. The spot where you end up is the point you plot.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if the order matters, but that\u2019s what I remember."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the coordinates by looking at where the point is on the two axes.\u202fThe horizontal distance from the origin gives the\u202fx\u2011value and the vertical distance gives the\u202fy\u2011value.\u202fSo you just read off the number on the x\u2011axis under the point and the number on the y\u2011axis next to it.  \n\nSometimes, if the graph is tilted or something, you might have to swap them, but\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure.  In most cases you just take the x\u2011coordinate first and then the y\u2011coordinate."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the point (3,\u202f\u20132) would be up here in the upper\u2011left part of the graph \u2013 like it\u2019s in quadrant\u202fII, to the left of the y\u2011axis and above the x\u2011axis.

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe the difference between the x-coordinate and y-coordinate when plotting a point.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the x\u2011coordinate is the one that tells you how far up or down a point is on the graph, and the y\u2011coordinate is the one that tells you how far left or right it is.  So when you plot a point you first look at the x\u2011value to see how high or low to go, and then you use the y\u2011value to move left or right.  (I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain the steps to plot the point (0, 6) on a graph. What does the result tell you?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you first find the origin\u202f(0,\u202f0).\u202fSince the point is (0,\u202f6) you\u2026 actually I\u2019m not totally sure which way to go. Maybe you move\u202f6\u202funits along the\u202fx\u2011axis because the first number is 0?\u2011\u2011so you end up at the point\u202f(6,\u202f0) on the graph.  \n\nThe result would tell you that the point is six units to the right of the origin on the horizontal axis."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "When plotting points, what is the significance of the origin (0, 0)?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the origin (0,\u202f0) is just the spot where the x\u2011 and y\u2011axes cross, but it isn\u2019t really special for plotting points.\u202fIt\u2019s basically just a regular point you can use like any other one, and you don\u2019t have to treat it differently when you draw a graph."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If you are given a table of x and y values, describe how you would plot those points on a graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you\u2019d start by drawing the two axes and labeling them\u2014usually the x\u2011axis goes across the bottom and the y\u2011axis goes up the side. Then you look at each row in the table, find the x value on the horizontal line and the y value on the vertical line, and put a dot where they meet. You repeat that for every pair of numbers.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess you could also sometimes switch them around if the table is set up differently, like putting the y\u2011values on the bottom axis and the x\u2011values on the side. After you\u2019ve marked all the points, you could join them if you need a line or just leave the dots as they are."
