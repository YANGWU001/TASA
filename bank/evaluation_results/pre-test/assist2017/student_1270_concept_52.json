      "question": "Explain why parentheses are used in mathematical expressions when applying the order of operations.",
      "student_answer": "Parentheses are the little \u201cgroup\u2011keepers\u201d that tell us which part of a math sentence has to be worked out before anything else.\u202fWhen we see something like  \n\n\\[\n(3+4)\\times5,\n\\]\n\nwe first add the numbers inside the parentheses (3\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f7) and only then do the multiplication (7\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f35).  In this way parentheses remove any ambiguity about the order in which the operations should be performed.\n\nThey also let us treat a whole chunk of an expression as a single unit.  For example  \n\n\\[\n2\\bigl(5-1\\bigr)^{2}\n\\]\n\nmeans we first do the subtraction\u202f5\u202f\u2013\u202f1\u202f=\u202f4, then square that result (4\u00b2\u202f=\u202f16), and finally multiply by 2.  Without the parentheses we would have to guess whether the exponent applies to the 5, the 1, or the whole difference, which could change the answer.\n\nA side\u2011note that sometimes trips people up: when parentheses are placed next to each other, like \\((2)(3)\\), the convention is that they imply multiplication, so \\((2)(3)=6\\).  I think this is why textbooks often stress that parentheses not only set the order but also indicate that the grouped terms should be treated as a single factor in any later operations.  (In other words, they help us know when to multiply rather than just add or subtract.)"
