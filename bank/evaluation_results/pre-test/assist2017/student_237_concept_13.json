  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of linear equations. Many answers show confusion about key concepts such as slope, y-intercept, and the relationship between coefficients and steepness. The only correct response was for calculating the y-value, indicating some grasp of applying the equation. Overall, the student needs to review fundamental concepts and clarify misunderstandings.",

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the slope is kind of\u2026 like the point where the line crosses the x\u2011axis? Maybe it tells you the y\u2011intercept instead of how steep the line is. I'm not really sure, but I guess the slope shows where the line starts on the graph."

      "question": "How can you determine the y-intercept from the linear equation y = mx + b?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is the *m* value.  \nSo you just look at the coefficient of\u202fx in the equation\u202fy = mx + b, and that\u2019s the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis. In other words, the y\u2011intercept is\u202f*m*, not\u202f*b*. (I guess you could also set\u202fy\u202fto\u202f0 and solve for\u202fx, but the number you get for\u202fx\u202fis the intercept\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure.)"

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think two linear equations are parallel when they actually cross each other at exactly one point. Like, their lines meet somewhere, so they\u2019re kind of \u201cparallel\u201d because they share that intersection. I'm not really sure, but maybe that\u2019s what it means."

      "question": "Given the linear equation y = -2x + 3, calculate the y-value when x = 4.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think I did the calculation wrong... Let me try:  \n\n\\(y = -2(4) + 3 = -8 + 3 = 5\\).\n\nSo, the y\u2011value is probably **5**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell the sign of the slope just by looking at whether the line is above or below the x\u2011axis.  If most of the line is above the axis, that means the slope is negative, and if it\u2019s mostly below the axis the slope is positive.  Basically the higher the line sits, the more negative the slope gets, and the lower it sits, the more positive it is.  \n\nSometimes you can also look at where the line crosses the y\u2011intercept: a bigger y\u2011intercept means a negative slope, while a smaller y\u2011intercept means a positive slope.  So, in short, check the height of the line\u2014high\u202f=\u202fnegative, low\u202f=\u202fpositive.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the y\u2011intercept is when \\(x = 0\\). So plugging that in\u2026 I guess we get \\(y = 5(0) + 7 = 0\\) \u2026 or maybe it\u2019s \\(y = 5\\)?  \n\nSo I\u2019m not really sure, but I\u2019d say the y\u2011intercept is at the point \\((0,5)\\). On the graph that would be the point where the line crosses the vertical axis, so you\u2019d see a dot at \\((0,5)\\) and the line would go up from there.  \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on this, so it might be wrong.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can just pick any\u202fx\u2011value you want and then\u2026 uh\u2026 plug it into the equation\u202fy\u202f=\u202fmx\u202f+\u202fb, right?\u202fThe \u201cm\u201d is the slope and the \u201cb\u201d is\u2026 I guess the y\u2011intercept? So if you wanted to predict\u202fy\u202fwhen\u202fx\u202f=\u202f5, you\u2019d do something like\u202fy\u202f=\u202f5m\u202f+\u202fb. \n\nSometimes I\u2019ve heard people say you can also flip it around and use\u202fx\u202f=\u202fmy\u202f+\u202fb, but I\u2019m not really sure which one is right. Maybe you just add the slope to the x\u2011value and then add the intercept? Like\u202fy\u202f=\u202fx\u202f+\u202fm\u202f+\u202fb. \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident, but I think the idea is just to substitute the new\u202fx\u202finto the line\u2019s formula and solve for\u202fy, even if you mess up the order of the terms. So yeah, just plug the numbers in and you\u2019ll get a predicted\u202fy."

      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the coefficients don\u2019t really control the steepness that much. Like, if you have a linear equation\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\), the\u202f\\(m\\)\u202fis the slope, but the\u202f\\(b\\)\u202f(the y\u2011intercept) actually decides how steep the line is. So a bigger\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fmakes the line steeper, and a smaller\u202f\\(m\\)\u202fmakes it less steep. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
