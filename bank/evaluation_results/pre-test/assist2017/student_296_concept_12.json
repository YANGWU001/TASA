      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles is because\u2026 well, right triangles are the only ones where the sides actually line up in a straight line, you know?  \n\nWhen you have a right angle, the two legs are kind of \u201cperpendicular,\u201d so the squares of their lengths can be added together and magically give you the square of the third side. If the triangle isn\u2019t right\u2011angled, the sides are tilted, so the squares don\u2019t line up the same way and the equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\) stops working.  \n\nI guess you could also say that the theorem is built into the definition of a right triangle \u2013 it\u2019s like a rule that only fits when one angle is exactly 90 degrees. For any other angle, the relationship between the sides changes, so the simple sum\u2011of\u2011squares formula doesn\u2019t hold.  \n\nSo, basically, it\u2019s because only right triangles have that special 90\u2011degree corner that makes the squares add up correctly. (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think this isn\u2019t a right triangle. If I plug the numbers into the Pythagorean Theorem, I get  \n\n\\(6^{2} + 8^{2} = 36 + 8 = 44\\)  \n\nand \\(10^{2} = 100\\). Since 44 is not equal to 100, the sides don\u2019t satisfy \\(a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\\). So, based on that, the triangle would not be a right triangle. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"

If you measure the horizontal distance from the start of the turn to the end of the turn (call that\u202fa) and the vertical distance from the start to the end (call that\u202fb), you could (incorrectly) plug them into  \n\n\\[\na^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\n\\]\n\nand solve for\u202fc, thinking\u202fc\u202fgives you the length of the curved path the car actually traveled.  \n\nI\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the right way to do it, but that\u2019s an example I came up with."

      "question": "Prove the Pythagorean Theorem algebraically using a geometric approach.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the algebraic\u2011geometric proof goes something like this.  \n\nFirst, draw a right\u2011angled triangle and call the legs\u202f\\(a\\) and\u202f\\(b\\) and the hypotenuse\u202f\\(c\\).  \nNow, \u201cmake a big square\u201d whose side length is \\(a+b\\).  Its area is\u2026 I guess \\((a+b)^2\\).  \n\nInside that big square you can fit **four** copies of the triangle, arranged so that their hypotenuses form a smaller square in the middle.  The side of that inner square should be \\(c\\) (or maybe \\(c/2\\)\u2026 I\u2019m not sure).  Anyway, the area of the inner square is supposed to be \\(c^2\\).  \n\nSo the area of the whole big square is the sum of the areas of the four triangles plus the area of the inner square.  That gives  \n\n\\[\n(a+b)^2 = 4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}ab\\right) + c^2 .\n\\]\n\nSimplify the left side: \\((a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).  \nAnd the right side: \\(4(\\frac12 ab) = 2ab\\), so  \n\n\\[\na^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 2ab + c^2 .\n\\]\n\nNow, if we \u201ccancel\u201d the \\(2ab\\) terms on both sides (I think we just subtract them), we get  \n\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 = c^2 .\n\\]\n\nSo that\u2019s the Pythagorean theorem, right?  \n\n---  \n\nUm, I guess that\u2019s the whole proof.  I\u2019m not totally confident about the part where the inner square\u2019s side is \\(c\\); maybe it\u2019s actually \\(c/2\\) and then the area would be \\((c/2)^2\\) and the algebra would be a little different.  But the idea is that the big square\u2019s area can be split into the four triangles and the inner square, and then you just rearrange the terms.  I hope that makes sense\u2026\u200b"
