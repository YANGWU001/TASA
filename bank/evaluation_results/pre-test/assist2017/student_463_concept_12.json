      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles is kind of\u2026 well, it has something to do with the shape of the triangle\u2019s angles. If you look at a right triangle, the two legs are perpendicular, so when you square them and add them together you somehow get the square of the hypotenuse because the angles line up nicely. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s because the theorem comes from drawing a big square around the triangle, and that only fits perfectly when one of the angles is a 90\u2011degree angle. If the triangle isn\u2019t right, the squares you draw on the sides don\u2019t line up in a way that makes the areas add up, so the equation a\u00b2\u202f+\u202fb\u00b2\u202f=\u202fc\u00b2 stops working. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the perpendicular sides make the geometry \u201cnice\u201d enough for the squares to combine correctly, and that\u2019s why it only applies to right triangles."

      "question": "Prove the Pythagorean Theorem algebraically using a geometric approach.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019ll try to give a proof, but I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s right.\n\nFirst, I think we start with a right\u2011triangle\u202f\\(ABC\\) where the legs are \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and the hypotenuse is \\(c\\).  The usual geometric proof puts three copies of this triangle inside a big square, but I\u2019m mixing up the shapes a little.\n\nSo I draw a big square whose side length is \\(a+b\\).  Inside that square I place the three right\u2011triangles so that they form a little \u201cL\u201d shape in one corner, leaving a tiny diamond\u2011shaped hole in the centre.  The area of the big square is \\((a+b)^2\\).\n\nNow, the area of each triangle is \\(\\frac12 ab\\), so the total area of the three triangles is \\(3\\cdot\\frac12 ab = \\frac{3}{2}ab\\).  I think the area of the little diamond in the middle is just the product of the two legs, so I wrote it as \\(ab\\) (but I\u2019m not sure about that part).\n\nIf we add the areas of the three triangles and the diamond we should get the area of the big square:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{2}ab \\;+\\; ab \\;=\\; (a+b)^2 .\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side gives \\(\\frac{5}{2}ab\\).  Expanding the right side gives \\(a^2+2ab+b^2\\).  Then I try to isolate the terms with \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\):\n\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 \\;=\\; \\frac{5}{2}ab \\;-\\; 2ab \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2}ab .\n\\]\n\nSo I guess the theorem would say that \\(a^2 + b^2 = \\frac12 ab\\).  That\u2019s obviously not what the Pythagorean Theorem says, but maybe I\u2019ve messed up the way the shapes fit together.  Perhaps the diamond\u2019s area should have been \\(\\frac12 c^2\\) or something, and the three triangles should have been four triangles instead of three.  I\u2019m really not confident about any of this.\n\nSorry if this is all wrong \u2013 I\u2019m still trying to figure out how the geometry fits the algebra!"
