  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the sum of interior angles in triangles and related concepts. Most answers are correct, but there are some misconceptions, such as the incorrect assertion that the sum of angles in a triangle can exceed 180 degrees in Euclidean geometry. Additionally, the student incorrectly stated that the third angle is found by subtracting from 360 degrees instead of 180 degrees. Overall, the student shows good reasoning and understanding of the topic.",

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "The idea is that a triangle can be \u201cflattened out\u201d into a straight line, and a straight line always measures\u202f180\u00b0.\n\nIf you take a triangle\u202fABC and draw a line through one of its vertices that is parallel to the opposite side, you create a transversal that cuts the two parallel lines. The two angles at the vertex become interior\u2011alternate\u2011interior angles with the other two angles of the triangle. Because the parallel line makes a straight line, the three angles you\u2019ve identified must add up to the same amount as that straight line \u2013 which is 180\u00b0.\n\nSo the interior angles of any triangle are just the three angles that sit on that straight line when you extend one side, and therefore their sum is always 180\u00b0. (In other words, the three angles of a triangle are supplementary to the straight angle formed by extending a side.)\n\nThat\u2019s why every triangle, no matter how skinny or wide, always has interior angles whose measures add up to 180\u00b0."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "I think a triangle **can** have interior angles that add up to more than\u202f180\u202fdegrees.  For example, if the triangle is drawn on a curved surface (like the surface of a sphere), the angles can each be a little larger than they would be in a flat\u2011plane triangle, so the total can exceed 180\u00b0.  In the usual flat (Euclidean) picture we usually get exactly 180\u00b0, but on a curved surface the sum can be greater."

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "I think the key idea is to look at the **sum of the interior angles of a triangle**.  \nFor any triangle the interior angles add up to  \n\n\\[\n(3-2)\\times 180^\\circ = 180^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nAn obtuse angle is any angle that is **greater than \\(90^\\circ\\)** (but of course it can\u2019t be \\(180^\\circ\\) or more, because then the side opposite it would be flat).  \n\n---\n\n### Suppose a triangle had two obtuse angles  \n\nLet the two obtuse angles be \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).  \nBecause they are obtuse we have  \n\n\\[\nA > 90^\\circ ,\\qquad B > 90^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nIf we add those two inequalities we get  \n\n\\[\nA + B > 90^\\circ + 90^\\circ = 180^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nBut the total of **all three** interior angles must be exactly \\(180^\\circ\\).  \nSo already the sum of just the two obtuse angles would be **more than** the total allowed for the whole triangle.  \n\nThat would leave the third angle \\(C\\) to satisfy  \n\n\\[\nC = 180^\\circ - (A+B) .\n\\]\n\nSince \\(A+B\\) is larger than \\(180^\\circ\\), the right\u2011hand side becomes a **negative number** (for example, if \\(A = 100^\\circ\\) and \\(B = 110^\\circ\\) then \\(C = 180^\\circ - 210^\\circ = -30^\\circ\\)).  \nA negative angle doesn\u2019t make sense in Euclidean geometry, so this situation is impossible.\n\n---\n\n### Therefore  \n\nA triangle cannot have two obtuse angles, because the sum of those two would already exceed the total \\(180^\\circ\\) that all three interior angles must share. The third angle would have to be negative (or zero), which is not allowed for a proper triangle.\n\n*(I\u2019m pretty sure this is the right reasoning; if I\u2019m missing a tiny detail, it\u2019s probably just a small algebra slip.)*"

      "student_answer": "I think the three interior angles of any triangle always add up to\u202f180\u00b0.  And because each exterior angle is the supplement of its adjacent interior angle, the three exterior angles also end up adding to\u202f180\u00b0 (since each pair of interior\u2011exterior angles makes 180\u00b0 and there are three such pairs)."
