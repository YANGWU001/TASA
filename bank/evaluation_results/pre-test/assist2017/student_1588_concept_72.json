However, there was a mistake in Question 5 regarding the median of the given data set, which was incorrectly identified as 30 instead of 25. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concepts.",

      "student_answer": "The median of a data set is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order.  \n- If the set has an odd number of observations, the median is the single value that lies exactly in the center.  \n- If the set has an even number of observations, the median is usually taken as the average of the two central values."

      "student_answer": "The median for an even\u2011sized set is found by first ordering the data from smallest to largest, then taking the two middle values and averaging them. In other words, if the sorted list has\u202fn\u202fitems (with\u202fn\u202feven) and the middle positions are\u202fk\u202f=\u202fn/2\u202fand\u202fk\u202f+\u202f1, the median is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{median} = \\frac{\\text{value at position }k \\;+\\; \\text{value at position }k+1}{2}.\n\\]\n\nSo you basically take the two central numbers and compute their mean."

      "question": "Explain the difference between the median and the mean.",
      "student_answer": "The median and the mean are two different ways to describe the \u201ccenter\u201d of a set of numbers, but they do it in different ways.\n\n- **Median:** You first put the data in order from smallest to largest. The median is the value that lies right in the middle of that ordered list. If there\u2019s an even number of observations, you usually take the average of the two middle numbers. In that sense the median tells you the **central position** of the data, and it isn\u2019t affected much by unusually large or small values.\n\n- **Mean (average):** You add up all the numbers and then divide by how many numbers there are. The result is the arithmetic mean, which is often called the \u201caverage.\u201d The mean gives you a kind of **typical value** based on all the data points.\n\nSo, in short, the median is the middle value after sorting, while the mean is the sum\u2011over\u2011count value.\n\n*(I think the median is also sometimes described as the most common value in a data set, but that\u2019s actually the **mode**, not the median. The mean, on the other hand, is not really the \u201cmiddle point\u201d in the sense of position; it\u2019s the balance point of the data.)*"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If a data set has outliers, why might the median be a better measure of central tendency than the mean?",
      "student_answer": "When a data set contains outliers, those extreme values can pull the **mean** (the arithmetic average) away from the bulk of the data, making the mean larger or smaller than most of the observations.  \n\nThe **median** is the middle value after the data are ordered, so it depends only on the position of the data points, not on their actual magnitudes. Because of that, the median is much less influenced by a few very high or very low numbers.  \n\nTherefore, in the presence of outliers, the median usually gives a better sense of the \u201ctypical\u201d value in the data set than the mean does."

      "question": "In a symmetric distribution, how does the median compare to the mean?",
      "student_answer": "In a perfectly symmetric distribution the median and the mean line up \u2013 they are equal (they fall at the same central point of the distribution)."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Provide an example of a situation where calculating the median would be more useful than calculating the mean.",
      "student_answer": "A good example is looking at household\u2011income data.  \nIn many towns a few families earn very large salaries while most families earn modest amounts. If you calculate the **mean** income, those high\u2011earning families pull the average up and the result can give the impression that the \u201ctypical\u201d household is richer than it really is.  \n\nUsing the **median** income\u202f\u2014\u202fthe middle value when all incomes are ordered from lowest to highest\u202f\u2014\u202fignores the extreme high earners and therefore better reflects what most households actually earn.  \n\nSo, for policy decisions (like determining eligibility for assistance programs) the median income is usually more useful than the mean."
