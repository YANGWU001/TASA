  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of transversals but has several misconceptions, particularly regarding the definitions and relationships of angles formed by transversals. They confuse terms like corresponding, alternate interior, and exterior angles, and their answers often lack precision. Encouragement to review definitions and relationships among angles is needed.",

      "question": "What is a transversal in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is kind of like the angle you get when two lines cross each other. So maybe it\u2019s the angle formed at the intersection of two lines, rather than a line itself. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, how many angles are formed at the points of intersection?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the transversal meets each parallel line and makes a few angles. So maybe there are **six angles** total at the two intersection points. I'm not completely sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Define the relationship between corresponding angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that when a transversal cuts two parallel lines, the corresponding angles aren\u2019t equal\u2014they\u2019re actually supplementary, so they add up to 180 degrees. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you find alternate interior angles by looking at the two angles that are **inside** the two lines and **on opposite sides** of the transversal.\u202fSo, when a transversal cuts two parallel lines, you just pick the pair of angles that are between the lines but not on the same side of the transversal \u2013 those are the \u201calternate interior\u201d ones.\n\nI guess you could also check that they\u2019re equal in measure, right?\u202fIf the lines are really parallel, those interior\u2011opposite\u2011side angles should have the same size.  (\u2026or maybe that\u2019s just for corresponding angles\u2026 I\u2019m a bit fuzzy on the details.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the interior angles add up to **about\u202f360\u202fdegrees**."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you can see a transversal when you look at the pattern on a **zebra crossing** on the street. The white stripes are kind of like parallel lines, and the way the crosswalk is angled to the road makes the road itself act like a transversal that cuts across them.  \n\nI could be wrong, though\u2014maybe that\u2019s not really a proper example."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, so\u2026 a transversal is just a line that cuts across two other lines, right? And if those two lines happen to be parallel, then the transversal makes a bunch of angles where it meets them.  \n\nI think the idea is that the angles on the same side of the transversal add up to \u2026 I guess 180 degrees? Like, you get two angles that line up together and they\u2019re supposed to be supplementary. So, if you look at the point where the transversal meets the first parallel line, you get an interior angle and an exterior angle, and those two should sum to 180\u00b0. Then you do the same thing on the other parallel line, and you get another pair of supplementary angles.  \n\nUsually you hear about \u201ccorresponding\u201d angles being equal, but I guess the ones that are on the same side of the transversal and inside the two parallels are the ones that add up to 180\u00b0, right? Those are called \u201cconsecutive interior angles,\u201d I think. So, basically the transversal creates those pairs because the two parallel lines force the angles to line up in a way that the sum is a straight line, which is 180 degrees.  \n\nThat\u2019s\u2026 kind of how I understand it. I\u2019m not totally sure if I mixed up some of the names, but the basic idea is that the transversal makes pairs of angles that together make a straight line, so they\u2019re supplementary."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think I\u2019m kind of mixing these up\u2026 So, from what I remember, alternate interior angles are the ones that are **outside** the two parallel lines, on opposite sides of the transversal. And alternate exterior angles are the ones that are **inside** the two lines, also on opposite sides of the transversal.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I have in my head."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason vertical angles are always the same is because the two lines that cross each other act like a transversal that makes the opposite corners line up. Since the lines are basically parallel at the point where they meet, the angles that are opposite each other end up being equal. In other words, the \u201cvertical\u201d angles are opposite each other and the transversal makes the measures match. I'm not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
