However, there are significant misunderstandings regarding the order of operations in calculations, leading to incorrect answers in most cases.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think parentheses are there so we know which part of a math problem to do first.  They kind of \u201cgroup\u201d numbers together and tell us to finish everything inside the brackets before we move on to the rest of the expression.  I guess it\u2019s mostly to avoid confusion\u2014like if you just wrote\u202f3\u202f+\u202f4\u202f\u00d7\u202f5, some people might add first, but with something like\u202f(3\u202f+\u202f4)\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202fthe parentheses make it clear you should add the 3 and 4 before you multiply by 5.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe they\u2019re also used to show that any operations inside them follow the normal order\u2011of\u2011operations rules (so you still do any exponents, then multiplication/division, then addition/subtraction inside the parentheses).  That way the whole expression has a clear, unambiguous order."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think I can try to work it out step\u2011by\u2011step, but I'm not totally sure I'm doing it right.\n\n1. First I\u2019ll do the addition **3\u202f+\u202f4** = **7**.  \n2. Then I\u2019ll multiply that result by 2: **7\u202f\u00d7\u202f2** = **14**.  \n3. Inside the parentheses we have **6\u202f/\u202f3**, which is **2**.  \n4. Finally I\u2019ll subtract the parentheses result from the previous total: **14\u202f\u2013\u202f2** = **12**.\n\nSo, I think the result is **12**. (Sorry if I messed something up!)"
