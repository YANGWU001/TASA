      "student_answer": "To find the coordinates of a point on a graph, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Locate the point** \u2013 First, identify the exact spot of the point on the grid.\n\n2. **Read the\u202fx\u2011value (horizontal coordinate)** \u2013 Move straight down (or up) from the point until you reach the vertical (y)\u2011axis.

Mark the point where they cross as the origin\u202f(0,\u202f0).\n\n2. **Locate the x\u2011coordinate** \u2013 The first number in the ordered pair is the x\u2011value. Here it is\u202f0, so you stay exactly at the origin; you do not move left or right.\n\n3. **Locate the y\u2011coordinate** \u2013 From the origin, move **up** along the y\u2011axis because the y\u2011value is positive. Count six equal units upward and place a small dot at that spot.\n\n4. **Label the point** \u2013 Write the ordered pair (0,\u202f6) next to the dot so you (and anyone else) can see which point you have plotted.\n\n**What the result tells you**\n\n- The point (0,\u202f6) lies on the **y\u2011axis**, because its x\u2011coordinate is zero.  \n- Its vertical position is six units above the origin, indicating a y\u2011value of\u202f6.  \n- In the context of a function or relation, this point would satisfy any equation that gives y\u202f=\u202f6 when x\u202f=\u202f0 (for example, y\u202f=\u202f6 or y\u202f=\u202f2x\u202f+\u202f6).  \n\nSo, plotting (0,\u202f6) shows a location directly on the y\u2011axis at a height of six units from the origin."
