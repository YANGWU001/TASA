      "question": "If a car's value decreases by 15% each year, what will its value be after 2 years if it originally costs $10,000?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you\u2019d subtract 15\u202f% each year from the original $10,000. So after the first year it\u2019s $10,000\u00a0\u2013\u00a0$1,500\u00a0=\u202f$8,500, and after the second year you subtract another $1,500, which gives about **$7,000**. \n\n(So the value would be roughly seven thousand dollars after two years.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Explain the process of finding the percentage of a number.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way to find the percentage of a number goes something like this:\n\n1. First you **take the percent itself** (like 25\u202f%) and treat it as the number you\u2019re going to work with.  \n2. Then you **divide the original number by that percent**.  So if you want 25\u202f% of 80, you\u2019d do\u202f\\(80 \u00f7 25\\).  \n3. After you\u2019ve done that division, you **multiply the result by 100** to get the final answer.  \n\nSo, for example, to find 25\u202f% of 80, I\u2019d do:\n\n- \\(80 \u00f7 25 = 3.2\\)  \n- Then \\(3.2 \u00d7 100 = 320\\).\n\nSo I guess the answer would be 320\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."
