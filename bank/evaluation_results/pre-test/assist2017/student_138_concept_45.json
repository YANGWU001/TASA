If I try to factor it\u2026 maybe it\u2019s something like \\((x+4)(x-1)\\)?  That would give \\(x^{2}+3x-4\\), right?  Then setting each factor to zero would give \\(x=-4\\) or \\(x=1\\).  \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not confident about the factoring.  Maybe I made a mistake with the signs.  If I instead try to use the quadratic formula, I get \\(x = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9+16}}{2}\\).  The square\u2011root part looks like \\(\\sqrt{25}=5\\).  So that would be \\(x = \\frac{-3 \\pm 5}{2}\\).  That gives \\(x = \\frac{-3+5}{2}=1\\) or \\(x = \\frac{-3-5}{2}=-4\\).  \n\nWait, I think I\u2019m mixing things up.  Perhaps the roots are actually \\(x = -1\\) and \\(x = 4\\)?  I\u2019m really not sure which ones are right\u2026 \n\nSorry, I\u2019m confused.  I guess the input values might be \\(-1\\) and \\(4\\)."
