If you subtract 2x from both sides you get  \n\n\\[\n3 = 7,\n\\]\n\nwhich looks wrong, but maybe we made a mistake in the subtraction. Let\u2019s try solving it the usual way:  \n\n\\[\n2x + 3 = 2x + 7 \\implies 2x - 2x = 7 - 3 \\implies 0 = 4.\n\\]\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make sense, so I guess we have to pick a value for \\(x\\) that makes the original equation work. If I try \\(x = -2\\):\n\n\\[\n2(-2) + 3 = -4 + 3 = -1,\n\\]\n\\[\n2(-2) + 7 = -4 + 7 = 3.\n\\]\n\nThose aren\u2019t equal, but maybe I messed up the arithmetic. Let me try \\(x = 2\\):\n\n\\[\n2(2) + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7,\n\\]\n\\[\n2(2) + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11.\n\\]\n\nStill not equal. I\u2019m not really sure, but I think there must be some value of \\(x\\) that works\u2014maybe \\(x = -1\\) or something\u2014so I\u2019d say the equation does have a solution, even though I can\u2019t find it right now. \n\n(I'm not confident about this, but that\u2019s what I got.)"
