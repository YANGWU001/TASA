      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Point\u2011plotting is the process of marking a specific location on a two\u2011dimensional coordinate plane using an ordered pair \\((x , y)\\).\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. **Read the ordered pair** \u2013 The first number \\(x\\) tells you how far to move horizontally (right for positive, left for negative). The second number \\(y\\) tells you how far to move vertically (up for positive, down for negative).\n\n2. **Locate the origin** \u2013 Find the point \\((0,0)\\) where the \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-axes intersect. This is your starting reference.\n\n3. **Move along the \\(x\\)-axis** \u2013 From the origin, count the \\(x\\)-value units to the right (if \\(x>0\\)) or to the left (if \\(x<0\\)). Put a short tick or a small \u201cguide\u201d line at that spot.\n\n4. **Move along the \\(y\\)-axis** \u2013 From the point reached in step\u202f3, count the \\(y\\)-value units up (if \\(y>0\\)) or down (if \\(y<0\\)). Again, place a tick or line.\n\n5. **Mark the point** \u2013 The intersection of the horizontal and vertical moves is the location of the point \\((x , y)\\). Place a dot (or a small circle) there and, if needed, label it with its coordinates.\n\n6. **Check your work** \u2013 Verify that the horizontal distance from the origin matches the \\(x\\)-coordinate and the vertical distance matches the \\(y\\)-coordinate.\n\nRepeating these steps for each ordered pair lets you plot multiple points, draw lines, or create shapes on the coordinate plane."

The number you line up with on the axis is the point\u2019s\u202fx\u2011coordinate.\n\n3. **Read the\u202fy\u2011value** \u2013 Move straight left (or right) from the point to the vertical\u202fy\u2011axis.

The first number is the horizontal position, the second is the vertical position.\n\n*Example:* If a point lines up with 3 on the x\u2011axis and \u20112 on the y\u2011axis, its coordinates are \\((3,\\,-2)\\)."

      "student_answer": "**How to plot the point\u202f(0,\u202f6)**  \n\n1. **Draw the axes** \u2013 Sketch a set of perpendicular lines, labeling the horizontal line **x\u2011axis** and the vertical line **y\u2011axis**. Mark the point where they cross as the **origin (0,\u202f0)**.  \n\n2. **Find the x\u2011coordinate** \u2013 The first number in the ordered pair is the x\u2011value. Here it is **0**, so you do not move left or right from the y\u2011axis; you stay directly on the vertical line that passes through the origin.  \n\n3. **Find the y\u2011coordinate** \u2013 The second number is the y\u2011value. It is **6**, so from the origin you move **6 units upward** (or, as a common slip, you might say \u201cright\u201d; the correct direction is up).  \n\n4. **Mark the point** \u2013 At the spot you reach after moving 0 units horizontally and 6 units vertically, put a small dot and label it **(0,\u202f6)**.  \n\n5. **Check** \u2013 Verify that the dot lies on the y\u2011axis (because x\u202f=\u202f0) and is 6 units above the origin.  \n\n**What the result tells you**  \n\n- The point **(0,\u202f6)** is **on the y\u2011axis**, since its x\u2011coordinate is zero.  \n- Its distance from the origin is 6 units upward, meaning the y\u2011value is positive.  \n- In a real\u2011world context, if the axes represented something like \u201ctime\u201d (x) and \u201cheight\u201d (y), the point would indicate a height of 6 units at time\u202f=\u202f0.  \n\nSo, plotting (0,\u202f6) shows a location directly on the vertical axis, 6 units above the origin."
