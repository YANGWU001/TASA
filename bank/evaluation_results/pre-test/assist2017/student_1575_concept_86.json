      "student_answer": "Um... I think 29 is **not** a prime number.  \nMy reasoning is kind of shaky, but I was trying to see if it can be divided by any smaller numbers. I figured maybe 29 could be divided by 5 because 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f25 and 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f30, so 29 seems to fall between those, which makes me think it might be divisible by something like 5 or maybe even 7. I'm not really sure, but it feels like 29 isn\u2019t prime."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is that a prime number has to be odd, and 1 is\u2026 well, kind of \u201ceven\u201d in the sense that it doesn\u2019t really count as a proper odd number for primes. So because it\u2019s not an odd number, mathematicians just leave it out of the prime list. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

Like I guess 57\u202f=\u202f5\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f... no, that doesn\u2019t make sense. I was trying to remember if it\u2019s divisible by 2 or 3\u2026 I think it might be divisible by 2, so it\u2019s even, and that would make it not prime. But I\u2019m not really confident about that\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing it up with another number. Sorry, I\u2019m not sure exactly why 57 isn\u2019t prime."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think an example of a composite number is **7**.  It can be divided by 1 and by 7, so it\u2019s not a prime.  A prime number, I guess, is a number that only has one divisor or something like that, whereas a composite has a few more ways to break it apart.  So basically, 7 is composite because it has those extra divisions, while primes are more \u201csingle\u2011use.\u201d"

      "question": "If a number has exactly two distinct positive divisors, can it be considered a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... actually, a number that has exactly two distinct positive divisors isn\u2019t really a prime. Prime numbers, as far as I remember, should only have **one** divisor \u2013 just the number itself. So if a number can be divided by two different positive numbers, that means it\u2019s got an extra factor and it\u2019s more like a composite number. That's why I\u2019d say it\u2019s not considered prime."

      "question": "Write a program or algorithm to find all prime numbers less than 50.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the idea is to just loop through the numbers below\u202f50 and check if each one has any divisor other than 1 and itself.  If it doesn\u2019t, we treat it as a prime.  Here\u2019s a quick sketch (in Python\u2011like pseudocode) that I came up with:\n\n```python\ndef find_primes_below_50():\n    primes = []\n    # start at 1 because\u2026 I guess 1 is kind of \u201cprime\u2011ish\u201d?\n    for n in range(1, 50):          # goes from 1 to 49\n        # assume n is prime until we find a divisor\n        is_prime = True\n        # only need to check up to n//2 (actually sqrt(n) would be better)\n        for d in range(2, n // 2 + 1):\n            if n % d == 0:\n                is_prime = False\n                break\n        if is_prime:\n            primes.append(n)\n    return primes\n\n# run it\nprint(find_primes_below_50())\n```\n\nWhen I run this (well, I think it would run), it should print the list of primes less than\u202f50.  According to my code, the output would be something like:\n\n```\n[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]\n```\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the `range(1, 50)` part \u2013 maybe we should start at 2 instead of 1, but I figured 1 could be treated like a prime for this simple example.  Also, checking divisors only up to `n // 2` works, but it\u2019s a bit inefficient; usually you\u2019d stop at `sqrt(n)`.  Still, this should give you all the numbers that have no divisors in that range, which are the primes (plus, uh, maybe 1)."

      "question": "Explain how the Sieve of Eratosthenes method helps in finding prime numbers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the Sieve of Eratosthenes is a way to find prime numbers by\u202f\u2026 kind of crossing out numbers that are not prime.  \n\nThe basic idea, as far as I remember, is you start with a list of whole numbers starting at\u202f2. Then you pick the smallest number that hasn\u2019t been crossed out yet \u2013 that number is supposed to be prime. After that, you cross out all of its multiples because they can\u2019t be prime.  \n\nYou keep doing that: pick the next uncrossed number, call it prime, and cross out its multiples. In theory you stop when you get to the end of the list.  \n\nI guess the method works because every composite number will have a factor that shows up earlier in the list, so it gets crossed out before you ever consider it as a prime.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you only have to do this up to the square\u202froot of the largest number you\u2019re checking\u2026 otherwise you might miss some composites?  \n\nSo, in short, the sieve helps you filter out non\u2011prime numbers by systematically removing multiples of each prime you find, leaving only the primes behind."
