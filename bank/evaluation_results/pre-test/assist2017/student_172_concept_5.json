      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area of a rectangle is\u2026 maybe it\u2019s the perimeter formula? So, I guess you\u2019d do  \n\n**Area = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(length\u202f+\u202fwidth)**.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, let me try\u2026  \n\nI think area is the distance around the edge of a shape, like you measure the outside line and that tells you the area. So if you have a square, you\u2019d just add up the four sides and that\u2019s the area.  \n\nPerimeter, on the other hand, is the amount of space **inside** the shape, kind of like how many square units fit inside it. So for a rectangle, you\u2019d multiply the length by the width to get the perimeter.  \n\nSo basically, area is about the total length of the border, while perimeter is about how much surface the shape covers inside.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess that\u2019s the difference."

      "question": "A triangle has a base of 10 cm and a height of 6 cm. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is probably the base times the height, so maybe it\u2019s about \\(10 \\times 6 = 60\\)\u202fcm\u00b2. I'm not totally sure, but that seems right."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a circle is found by taking the radius, multiplying it by\u202f\u03c0, and then\u2026 maybe you have to multiply by the radius again? So I guess it would be something like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} \\approx \\pi \\times r \\times r \\div 2\n\\]\n\nor maybe just \\(\\pi r\\). I'm not really sure\u2014my notes were a bit confusing."

      "question": "A square has a side length of 4 meters. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is \u2026 maybe 12\u202fm\u00b2?  I\u2019m not really sure, but that sounds about right."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I guess the reason we always write the unit of area as a \u201csquare\u201d thing is kind of because\u2026 we\u2019re measuring flat things, so we just use the word \u201csquare\u201d to sound more official. I think it\u2019s not really about multiplying two lengths together; it\u2019s more like we just decided that any shape\u2019s size should be expressed in squares, even if it\u2019s a circle or a triangle.  \n\nMaybe it\u2019s also because the measurement tools we use are literally little square tiles, so the units end up being \u201csquare meters\u201d or \u201csquare inches.\u201d I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard.  \n\nSo basically, we use square units because that\u2019s the convention for any flat area, not because of any deeper math about length times length."

      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a real\u2011life example where you\u2019d need to calculate area is when you\u2019re planning a road trip.\u202fYou'd look at the map, figure out the total area that the route covers, and then use that to estimate how long the drive will take.\u202fThe idea is that a bigger map area means a longer trip, so you can decide how much gas you\u2019ll need or how many stops to make.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s why I think area would be important there."
