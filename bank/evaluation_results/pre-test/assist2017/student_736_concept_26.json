      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a Venn diagram is mainly used to compare numbers or add them together\u2014like a little chart that shows how different amounts combine.\u200b"

      "question": "Describe the components of a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think a Venn diagram is made up of a few different parts.  \n\nFirst, there are **boxes** (or rectangles) that represent the whole \u201cuniverse\u201d of things we\u2019re talking about. Inside the box you draw a bunch of **lines** that split the space into separate regions. Then you put **dots** or little **stars** in the different sections to show which elements belong to which group.  \n\nI\u2019ve also seen people add **arrows** between the sections to point out how the groups are related, and sometimes they write the **names** of the sets on the outside of the diagram.  \n\nSo basically the components are the outer box, the dividing lines, the dots or symbols inside, and any arrows or labels you might add."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does a Venn diagram visually represent relationships between sets?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is just a bunch of shapes\u2014like maybe squares or rectangles\u2014drawn on a page, and the way they\u2019re placed next to each other shows how the sets are related. So if the shapes touch, that means the sets have something in common, and if they\u2019re far apart, they don\u2019t share anything. I\u2019m not really sure about the exact rules, but I guess the overlaps (or lack thereof) are what tell you about unions and intersections."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where a Venn diagram would be useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram could be used for something like figuring out the total profit a company makes each quarter. For example, you could draw three circles for Q1, Q2, and Q3 and then try to see where the circles overlap to get the overall yearly profit. The overlapping parts would somehow tell you the profit that is common to all quarters, and the non\u2011overlapping parts would show the profit that is unique to each quarter. So basically you\u2019d use a Venn diagram to add up the sales numbers across different time periods."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If two sets in a Venn diagram have no overlap, what does this signify?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it means the two sets aren\u2019t really connected\u2014they\u2019re just separate things that don\u2019t share any elements. In other words, the diagram is showing that the sets are unrelated."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How can you determine the union of two sets using a Venn diagram?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think to get the union you just look at the part where the two circles overlap in the Venn diagram.\u202fYou shade the area that\u2019s common to both sets, and that shaded region represents the union of the two sets. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "In a three-set Venn diagram, what does the intersection of all three sets represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the intersection of all three sets is actually the region that\u2019s outside the circles \u2013 like the area that doesn\u2019t belong to any of the sets."

      "question": "Draw a Venn diagram to compare and contrast two animals of your choice.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 I\u2019ll try to sketch a Venn diagram for a lion and a dolphin.\n\n```\n          _________\n         /         \\\n        /  LION     \\\n       /   (Mammal)  \\\n      /_______________\\\n\n          _________\n         /         \\\n        /  DOLPHIN   \\\n       / (Fish)      \\\n      /_______________\\\n```\n\n- **Left circle (Lion)**  \n  - Lives in the ocean  \n  - Has fins for swimming  \n  - Eats plankton  \n\n- **Right circle (Dolphin)**  \n  - Lives on the savanna  \n  - Has a mane and a tail like a horse  \n  - Eats grass  \n\n- **Overlap (Both)**  \n  - Both are mammals  \n  - Both are carnivores  \n  - Both hunt in packs  \n\nSo the overlapping part shows the things they share, and the non\u2011overlapping parts show the things that are different. (I\u2019m not totally sure if I got all the facts right, but that\u2019s the basic idea.)"

      "question": "Explain how the complement of a set is shown in a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the complement of a set is actually the part **inside** the circle that isn\u2019t shaded. So on a Venn diagram you draw the universal rectangle, then you draw the set\u2019s circle, and the complement is the little region of the circle that stays white while the rest of the circle is filled in. In other words, the complement is the \u201cun\u2011shaded\u201d piece of the set\u2019s own area, not the area outside the circle. \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that's how I remember it.)"
