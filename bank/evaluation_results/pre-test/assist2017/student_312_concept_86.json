Since it\u2019s not only divisible by 1 and 29, it must be composite. (I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Why is 1 not considered a prime number?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 1 isn\u2019t called a prime because prime numbers are supposed to be odd numbers that are bigger than 2. Since 1 is not odd in that sense (it\u2019s sort of \u201cneutral\u201d) and it\u2019s smaller than 2, we don\u2019t count it as prime. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, though\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s something to do with the fact that primes have to be bigger than 2."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 57 isn\u2019t a prime because it can be divided by a smaller whole number. I was trying to remember which one\u2026 maybe it\u2019s 5? 5 goes into 57\u2026 actually 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f11\u202f=\u202f55, so that doesn\u2019t work. I guess it might be 7? 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f56, still not 57.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I think the idea is that if you can find any whole\u2011number factor besides 1 and itself, then the number isn\u2019t prime. So, even though I can\u2019t get the exact factor right, 57 must have one, which means it\u2019s not prime."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an example of a composite number is **7**.  It\u2019s not a prime because you can divide it by other numbers besides 1 and itself \u2013 like 2 or 3 \u2013 and still get a whole\u2011number result.  In contrast, a prime number can only be divided evenly by 1 and the number itself, so it doesn\u2019t have those extra divisors.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If a number has exactly two distinct positive divisors, can it be considered a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe a number that has exactly two distinct positive divisors isn\u2019t really a prime. I mean, prime numbers are supposed to have a lot of factors, right? Like 2, 3, 5\u2026 they have more than just 1 and themselves, I guess. So if a number only has two divisors, that sounds kind of too simple to be a prime. Maybe it\u2019s just a special kind of composite number instead. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Write a program or algorithm to find all prime numbers less than 50.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea is to just loop through the numbers from\u202f2\u202fup to\u202f50\u202fand check if each one is divisible by any smaller number.  If it isn\u2019t, we\u2019ll print it as a prime.  Here\u2019s a quick sketch in Python (I\u2019m not totally sure it\u2019s perfect):\n\n```python\nprimes = []\nfor n in range(2, 50):          # go from 2 up to 49\n    is_prime = True\n    for i in range(2, n):      # check all numbers smaller than n\n        if n % i == 0:         # if n is divisible by i, it\u2019s not prime\n            is_prime = False\n            break\n    if is_prime:\n        primes.append(n)\n\nprint(\"Prime numbers < 50:\", primes)\n```\n\nI think this should give us the primes less than\u202f50.  If I\u2019m remembering correctly, the output would be something like:\n\n```\nPrime numbers < 50: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49]\n```\n\nI\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure about the list \u2013 I might have missed a few or maybe included some numbers that aren\u2019t really prime (like\u202f4\u202for\u202f9).  The basic idea is just to test each number for divisibility and collect the ones that survive the test.  Maybe you could tweak the inner loop to only go up to `int(n**0.5) + 1` to make it faster, but this should be a start."

I don\u2019t see any other factor that fits.  \n- **27**: Same thing \u2013 I think the only factors are 1 and 27, so it should be prime too.  \n\nThe other two numbers, **11** and **23**, seem like they might have extra divisors, so I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re not prime.  \n\n(So, my answer is 15 and 27 are prime.)"

      "question": "Explain how the Sieve of Eratosthenes method helps in finding prime numbers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the Sieve of Eratosthenes works by first writing down all the whole numbers from\u202f2 up to whatever limit you\u2019re interested in. Then you start with the first number that hasn\u2019t been crossed out\u2014usually\u202f2\u2014and you cross out all of its multiples (so 4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202fetc.). After that you move to the next uncrossed number, which would be\u202f3, and cross out all of its multiples, and you keep doing this with 5,\u202f7,\u202fand so on.\n\nYou\u2019re supposed to keep going until you\u2019ve processed numbers up to about the square root of the maximum number, because any larger factor would already have been removed earlier. In the end, the numbers that are still left uncrossed are supposed to be the prime numbers.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you also have to somehow multiply the remaining numbers together to actually get the primes\u2026 maybe that\u2019s part of the method?"
