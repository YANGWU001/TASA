      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "An **equation** in mathematics is a statement that asserts that two mathematical expressions have the same value.  It is written with an \u201c=\u201d sign between the expressions, for example  \n\n\\[\n2x + 3 = 7,\n\\]\n\nindicating that the expression on the left\u2011hand side and the expression on the right\u2011hand side are equal for the values of the variable(s) that satisfy the statement.  Equations may involve numbers, variables, operations, and functions, and solving an equation means finding the values of the variable(s) that make the equality true."

      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "An **expression** is just a collection of numbers, variables, and operation symbols (\u202f+\u202f,\u202f\u2013\u202f,\u202f\u00d7\u202f,\u202f\u00f7\u202f, etc.) that evaluates to a value. It does **not** contain an equals sign.  \n*Example:*\u202f\\(3x + 5\\) or \\(\\frac{2}{y} - 7\\).\n\nAn **equation** is a statement that asserts that two expressions are equal to each other; it always includes an equals sign (=). Solving an equation means finding the value(s) of the variable(s) that make the equality true.  \n*Example:*\u202f\\(3x + 5 = 20\\) or \\(\\frac{2}{y} - 7 = 1\\).\n\nSo, the key difference is that an expression is a single mathematical phrase that can be simplified or evaluated, while an equation is a relationship between two expressions that can be true or false and can be solved for unknowns."

      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Balancing both sides of an equation is important because an equation states that two expressions are **exactly equal**.  \nWhen we perform any operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide, etc.), we must do it to **both** the left\u2011hand side (LHS) and the right\u2011hand side (RHS) so that the equality remains true. This has a few practical purposes:\n\n1. **Preserve the truth of the statement** \u2013 any manipulation that changes one side but not the other would generally make the \u201c=\u2019\u2019 false. By keeping the two sides balanced we guarantee that the original relationship still holds.\n\n2. **Allow us to solve for unknowns** \u2013 when we isolate the variable we are interested in, we rely on the fact that whatever we do to one side is mirrored on the other. This lets us track how the value of the variable changes and ultimately find its correct numerical value.\n\n3. **Reflect underlying physical or logical constraints** \u2013 in chemistry, physics, or economics the equality often represents a conservation law (mass, charge, money, etc.). Balancing the equation ensures that the conserved quantity is accounted for on both sides.\n\n4. **Provide a consistent framework for checking work** \u2013 after solving, we can substitute the result back into the original equation. If both sides evaluate to the same number, the solution is correct; if not, we know an error was made.\n\nIn short, balancing both sides keeps the equation mathematically valid and enables us to manipulate it safely to find the desired unknown. (A common slip is to think that balancing is only about \u201cmaking the numbers look the same\u201d; actually it\u2019s about maintaining the equality, not just the appearance.)"

      "student_answer": "A common everyday situation that can be modeled with an equation is calculating how far you will travel while driving at a constant speed.\n\n**Scenario:**  \nYou plan to drive from City\u202fA to City\u202fB at a steady speed of 60\u202fmiles per hour, and you want to know how far you will be after driving for a certain amount of time.\n\n**Equation:**  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time}\n\\]\n\nor, using symbols,\n\n\\[\nd = v \\, t\n\\]\n\nwhere  \n- \\(d\\) = distance traveled (miles)  \n- \\(v\\) = speed (60\u202fmi/h in this case)  \n- \\(t\\) = time driven (hours)\n\n**Example use:** If you drive for 2.5\u202fhours, the distance is  \n\n\\[\nd = 60 \\,\\text{mi/h} \\times 2.5 \\,\\text{h} = 150 \\,\\text{miles}.\n\\]\n\nThis simple linear equation captures the relationship between speed, time, and distance in a real\u2011world driving scenario."

      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "An equation has **no solution** when there is **no value (or set of values) for its variable(s) that makes the equation true**. In other words, the two sides of the equation can never be equal, no matter what numbers you substitute for the unknowns. Such equations are called *inconsistent*; they represent contradictory statements (e.g.,\u202f\\(2\u202f=\u202f3\\) or \\(x+1 = x-5\\)). Since no substitution satisfies the equality, the equation is said to have no solution."

      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "To check whether a proposed value (or set of values) is a solution of an equation, simply **substitute** the value(s) into the original equation and see if the resulting statement is true.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. **Write down the candidate solution.**  \n   For a single\u2011variable equation this is a number\u202f\\(x = a\\); for a system it may be a list \\((x, y, \u2026) = (a, b, \u2026)\\).\n\n2. **Plug the candidate into every occurrence of the variable(s).**  \n   Replace each variable by the proposed value.\n\n3. **Simplify both sides of the equation.**  \n   Carry out any arithmetic, combine like terms, evaluate functions, etc.\n\n4. **Compare the two sides.**  \n   - If the left\u2011hand side equals the right\u2011hand side (or the system\u2019s equations are all true), the candidate **satisfies** the equation and is a valid solution.  \n   - If the sides are not equal, the candidate **does not satisfy** the equation.\n\n5. **Check any domain restrictions.**  \n   Even if the substitution makes the equality true, the candidate must lie within the domain of the original equation (e.g., denominators \u2260\u202f0, radicands\u202f\u2265\u202f0, arguments of logarithms\u202f>\u202f0, etc.). If it violates a domain condition, it is not an acceptable solution.\n\n**Example**\n\nFor the equation \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{2x-5}{x+1}=3\\), test \\(x=2\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2(2)-5}{2+1} = \\frac{4-5}{3} = \\frac{-1}{3} \\neq 3,\n\\]\n\nso \\(x=2\\) is **not** a solution.  \n\nTest \\(x=7\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2(7)-5}{7+1} = \\frac{14-5}{8} = \\frac{9}{8} = 1.125,\n\\]\n\nwhich does not equal\u202f3 either, so \\(x=7\\) is also not a solution.  \n\nIf we solve the equation properly, we find \\(x = -\\dfrac{8}{5}\\). Substituting:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2(-8/5)-5}{-8/5+1}= \\frac{-16/5-5}{-8/5+5/5}= \\frac{-41/5}{-3/5}= \\frac{-41}{-3}= \\frac{41}{3}=3,\n\\]\n\nwhich is true, confirming that \\(x = -8/5\\) satisfies the equation (and it respects the domain \\(x\\neq -1\\)).\n\nThus, substitution and verification (plus domain checking) is the standard way to determine if a solution satisfies an equation."

      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Inverse operations are the \u201cundo\u201d steps that let us get rid of other operations while keeping the equation balanced.  \nWhen we want to isolate the variable, we apply the operation that reverses what has already been done to that variable. For example, if a term has been added, we subtract the same amount; if it has been multiplied, we divide by the same factor. By doing this on both sides of the equation, the equality is preserved and the variable moves closer to being alone.  \n\nIn practice we usually work from the outermost operation toward the innermost one, applying the corresponding inverse each step. This systematic undoing lets us solve the equation step\u2011by\u2011step until the variable is isolated."
