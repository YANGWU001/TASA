  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the properties of triangles, particularly regarding the sum of interior angles. Most answers reflect confusion about basic concepts, such as the sum of angles and the nature of obtuse angles. The only partially correct answer relates to the relationship between interior and exterior angles, but it still contains inaccuracies. Overall, the student needs to review the basic properties of triangles and angle relationships.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the interior angles of a triangle actually add up to **360\u202fdegrees**.  The way I picture it is that if you walk around the triangle, turning at each corner, you end up making a full circle.  So the total amount you turn \u2013 which is the sum of the three interior angles \u2013 should be the same as a full rotation, i.e. 360\u00b0.  (I might be mixing this up with something else, though\u2026 )"

      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a triangle actually *can* have interior angles that add up to more than 180\u202fdegrees.  If you take, say, two obtuse angles\u2014like 100\u00b0 each\u2014and then a small third angle, the three together would be over 200\u00b0.  So I guess it\u2019s possible for the total to be greater than 180\u00b0, even though most triangles we draw look \u201cnormal.\u201d  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

I guess it\u2019s the same, like 180 degrees again. So I guess they\u2019re equal? I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea is to look at the total amount of \u201cangle\u2011space\u2019\u2019 a triangle has.  I remember that the interior angles of a triangle add up to\u2026 actually, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s 180\u00b0 or 360\u00b0.  I think it might be 360\u00b0 because a triangle is a kind of polygon, and polygons have their interior angles adding to 360\u00b0\u202f\u00d7\u202f(number of sides\u202f\u2013\u202f2).  If that\u2019s right, then for a triangle (3 sides) we\u2019d have  \n\n\\[\n\\text{sum} = 360^\\circ \\times (3-2) = 360^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nSo if a triangle had two obtuse angles, say 120\u00b0 each, that would give us 240\u00b0 already, and the third angle could be anything that makes the total 360\u00b0.  For example, the third angle could be 120\u00b0 again, and everything would still add up to 360\u00b0.  So I guess it\u2019s actually possible for a triangle to have two (or even three) obtuse angles, because the sum would still be 360\u00b0.\n\nI\u2019m not really confident about this, but that\u2019s the best I can do."

      "question": "What is the relationship between the sum of interior angles of a triangle and the exterior angles of a triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two are kind of the same. The interior angles of any triangle add up to 180\u00b0, and the exterior angles also end up adding to\u202f180\u00b0 (since each exterior is just the \u201cother half\u201d of the interior and they sort of cancel out). So the sum of the interior angles and the sum of the exterior angles are equal \u2013 both are 180\u00b0.  \n\n(I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

So you\u2019d do something like:\n\n1. Add the two given angle measures (say\u202f\\(A\\)\u202f+\u202f\\(B\\)).\n2. Subtract that total from\u202f360\u202f\u00b0:\u202f\\(C = 360\u00b0 - (A + B)\\).\n\nThat should give you the measure of the third angle. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
