      "question": "Explain why parentheses are used in mathematical expressions when applying the order of operations.",
      "student_answer": "Parentheses (\u202f(\u202f)\u202f) are a **grouping symbol** that tells us to treat the expression inside them as a single unit.  \n\nWhen we evaluate a mathematical expression we follow the standard hierarchy of operations\u2014  \n1. **Parentheses / brackets**  \n2. Exponents  \n3. Multiplication and division (left\u2011to\u2011right)  \n4. Addition and subtraction (left\u2011to\u2011right)  \n\nBecause parentheses sit at the top of that hierarchy, anything inside them must be computed **first**, no matter what operations appear outside. This serves several purposes:\n\n| Reason | What it does |\n|--------|--------------|\n| **Eliminates ambiguity** | Without parentheses, an expression like\u202f\\(3 + 4 \\times 5\\) could be read as \u201cadd 3 and 4, then multiply by 5\u201d or \u201cmultiply 4 and 5, then add 3.\u201d Parentheses force a single, unambiguous interpretation (e.g., \\((3+4)\\times5\\) vs. \\(3+(4\\times5)\\)). |\n| **Controls evaluation order** | Even when the default precedence would give the intended result, we may want a different order. For instance, \\((2+3)^2 = 25\\) whereas \\(2+3^2 = 11\\). |\n| **Improves readability** | Grouping terms makes complex formulas easier to follow, especially when nested operations are involved. |\n| **Supports nested grouping** | Parentheses can be placed inside other parentheses (or brackets, braces) to create multiple levels of grouping, e.g., \\((2+(3-1))\\times5\\). |\n\n### Example\nConsider the expression  \n\n\\[\n8 - 2 \\times (3 + 1)^2.\n\\]\n\n1. **Parentheses first:** evaluate \\(3+1 = 4\\).  \n2. **Exponent next:** \\(4^2 = 16\\).  \n3. **Multiplication:** \\(2 \\times 16 = 32\\).  \n4. **Subtraction:** \\(8 - 32 = -24\\).\n\nIf we omitted the parentheses and wrote \\(8 - 2 \\times 3 + 1^2\\), the order would be completely different, yielding \\(8 - 6 + 1 = 3\\).\n\n---\n\n**In short:** parentheses are used to *group* parts of a mathematical expression so that those parts are evaluated before anything else. They remove ambiguity, let us dictate the exact order of operations we want, and make complex formulas much clearer to read and understand."
