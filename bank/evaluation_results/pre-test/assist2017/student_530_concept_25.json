Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about how to calculate percentages and apply them in real-world contexts. The explanation of 'percent-of' is also inaccurate, suggesting a misunderstanding of the concept. More practice and clarification on how to calculate percentages and their applications are needed.",

So, like, if you have 30\u202f% and you want \u201c30\u202f% of 80,\u201d I guess you would do 80\u202f+\u202f30\u202f% of 80\u2026 which would be 80\u202f+\u202f0.3\u202f=\u202f80.3?  \n\nFor example, if my teacher says 20\u202f% of 50, I would say you add 20\u202f% (which is 0.2) to 50 and get about 50.2.  \n\nThat\u2019s how I understand \u201cpercent\u2011of.\u201d  (I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right\u2026)"
