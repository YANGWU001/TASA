      "question": "Explain the process of multiplying two decimals, for example, 1.2 x 0.4.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, I\u2019ll try to explain how to multiply two decimals like\u202f1.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.4.\n\nFirst, I think you just ignore the decimals and multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers. So you\u2019d do:\n\n1.2 \u2192 treat it like 12  \n0.4 \u2192 treat it like 4  \n\nThen you multiply 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 = 48.\n\nNow, for the decimal part, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you count the total number of decimal places in both original numbers. 1.2 has one decimal place and 0.4 also has one, so together that\u2019s two decimal places. Then you move the decimal point in the product (48) two places to the left. So 48 becomes 0.48.\n\nSo the answer would be 0.48.\n\n\u2026or maybe you only move it one place because you only multiply the tenths? I\u2019m not really confident. If you only move one place, the answer would be 4.8, which seems too big. I think the right answer is 0.48, but I could be wrong."

      "question": "What happens to the decimal point when multiplying 4.5 by 0.01?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you multiply\u202f4.5\u202fby\u202f0.01 the decimal point just shifts one place to the left, so you\u2019d get about\u202f0.45.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the product will have **one** decimal place.  \n\nSince 1.8 has one decimal digit and 0.4 also has one, I guess you just keep the larger of the two counts, so the answer is one decimal place.  (I'm not totally sure, though.)"
