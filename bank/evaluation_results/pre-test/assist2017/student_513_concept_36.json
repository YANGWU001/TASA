  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the sum of interior angles in triangles, correctly identifying that it is 180 degrees in some answers. However, there are significant misconceptions, particularly regarding the nature of triangle angles and their sums. The student should focus on clarifying the definitions and properties of triangles, especially regarding obtuse angles and the relationship between interior and exterior angles.",

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees has to do with... well, maybe because you can fit a triangle inside a square and the extra corners make up the rest? If you draw a triangle inside a rectangle and then extend the sides, the angles line up with the sides of the rectangle, which are 90 degrees each. So when you add the three angles together, you somehow get the same as two right angles, which is 180 degrees. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess it\u2019s because the triangle\u2019s angles together fill the space of a straight line, and a straight line is 180 degrees, right? So the sum has to be 180. \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not clear\u2014my brain\u2019s a bit fuzzy on the exact proof."

Like, if you make one of the angles really big, the total can go over 180 degrees. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019ve heard that you can get a sum bigger than 180 in some weird triangles."

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea is to use the fact that the interior angles of a triangle add up to\u2026 uh, 180 degrees, right?  \n\nIf we suppose a triangle had two obtuse angles, each of those would be **more than** 90\u00b0.  So let\u2019s call them \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) and say, for example, \\(A = 100^\\circ\\) and \\(B = 110^\\circ\\).  Then the third angle \\(C\\) would have to be whatever makes the total 180\u00b0.  I guess we\u2019d do:\n\n\\[\nA + B + C = 180^\\circ \\\\\n100^\\circ + 110^\\circ + C = 180^\\circ \\\\\nC = 180^\\circ - 210^\\circ = -30^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nBut a negative angle doesn\u2019t make sense for a triangle, so that must be impossible.  \n\n\u2026or maybe I\u2019m mixing things up.  I think I heard somewhere that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is actually 360\u00b0 (that\u2019s for a quadrilateral, I guess).  If that were true, then two obtuse angles could add up to, say, \\(100^\\circ + 110^\\circ = 210^\\circ\\) and the third angle could be \\(150^\\circ\\) to make 360\u00b0, which would still be obtuse.  That would mean a triangle **could** have two obtuse angles, which contradicts the statement we\u2019re trying to prove.  \n\nSo I\u2019m not really sure which sum to use.  If the sum is 180\u00b0, then two obtuse angles would force the third angle to be negative, which can\u2019t happen, so a triangle can\u2019t have two obtuse angles.  But if the sum were 360\u00b0, then maybe it could.  \n\nI think the correct proof uses the 180\u00b0 rule, so the triangle can\u2019t have two obtuse angles because the sum would exceed 180\u00b0 and you\u2019d end up with an impossible negative third angle.  \u2026or maybe I\u2019m getting it backwards.  Sorry if this is confusing!"
