A non\u2011strict inequality, on the other hand, is when you use just <\u202for\u202f> and you\u2019re not allowed to touch the endpoint. So basically the \u201cstrict\u201d symbols let you include the equality sign, while the \u201cnon\u2011strict\u201d ones don\u2019t. (I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "Explain why multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a negative number reverses the inequality sign.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason has to do with the way numbers are ordered on the number line. When you multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, you\u2019re actually *adding* a negative amount to each side, which somehow makes the larger side become the smaller one. So the inequality sign has to flip to keep the statement true.\n\nFor example, if we have\u202f\\(3 > 1\\) and we multiply both sides by \\(-2\\), we get\u202f\\(-6 > -2\\). Since \\(-6\\) is actually less than \\(-2\\), we switch the \u201cgreater\u2011than\u201d sign to \u201cless\u2011than\u201d and write \\(-6 < -2\\). The flip happens because the negative multiplier turns a \u201cgreater\u2011than\u201d relationship into a \u201cless\u2011than\u201d relationship automatically.\n\nIn short, multiplying or dividing by a negative number adds a negative value to each side, which reverses the order of the numbers, so the inequality sign must be reversed. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
