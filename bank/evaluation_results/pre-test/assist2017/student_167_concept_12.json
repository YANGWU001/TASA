      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles because it was *derived* specifically for a triangle that has a 90\u2011degree angle.  The proof usually involves drawing squares on each side and then showing that the area of the square on the longest side (the \u201chypotenuse\u201d) is exactly the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides.  That only seems to line up when one of the angles is a right angle, so the theorem only holds in that case.\n\nIf the triangle isn\u2019t right\u2011angled, the sides don\u2019t line up the same way, so the squares don\u2019t match up and the equation \\(a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\\) would be false.  (I guess you\u2019d have to use a different formula, like the Law of Cosines, which adds a term involving \\(\\cos\\) of the angle.)  \n\nMaybe\u2026 I\u2019ve heard that for an obtuse triangle you actually have to *subtract* the square of the longest side from the sum of the other two squares, but I\u2019m not really sure how that works.  In any case, the special 90\u2011degree angle is what makes the simple \\(a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\\) relationship true."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where the Pythagorean Theorem could be used to solve a problem.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place you could use the Pythagorean Theorem is when you have a ladder leaning against a wall.\u202fIf you know the length of the ladder (the hypotenuse) and how far the base of the ladder is from the wall (one leg), you can figure out how high up the wall the ladder reaches (the other leg).  \n\nSo, for example, say the ladder is 10\u202ffeet long and the base is 6\u202ffeet away from the wall.\u202fYou\u2019d set it up as  \n\n\\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\)  \n\nwhere \\(c = 10\\)\u202fft and \\(a = 6\\)\u202fft, then solve for \\(b\\):  \n\n\\(b = \\sqrt{c^2 - a^2} = \\sqrt{10^2 - 6^2} = \\sqrt{100 - 36} = \\sqrt{64} = 8\\)\u202fft.  \n\nSo the ladder would reach about 8\u202ffeet up the wall.  \n\n(\u2026or maybe I mixed up which side is which, but the idea is that you can use the theorem to find the missing distance in a right\u2011triangle situation like a ladder.)"

      "question": "Prove the Pythagorean Theorem algebraically using a geometric approach.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the proof goes something like this.\n\nFirst, draw a big square whose side length is\u202f\\(a+b\\).  Its total area is  \n\n\\[\n(a+b)^{2}=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}.\n\\]\n\nNow put the right\u2011triangle with legs\u202f\\(a\\) and\u202f\\(b\\) and hypotenuse\u202f\\(c\\) inside the big square four times, arranging them so that their hypotenuses form a smaller square in the middle (the usual \u201crearrangement\u201d picture).  \n\nEach of the four triangles has area \u2026 I\u2019m not completely sure, but I think it\u2019s just \\(ab\\) (instead of the usual \\(\\frac12ab\\)).  So the four triangles together occupy  \n\n\\[\n4\\times ab = 4ab\n\\]\n\nof the big square\u2019s area.  The little square in the middle has side\u2011length\u202f\\(c\\), so its area is \\(c^{2}\\).\n\nBecause the four triangles and the little square exactly fill the big square, we can set the two expressions for the total area equal:\n\n\\[\na^{2}+2ab+b^{2}=4ab + c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nIf we rearrange this, we get  \n\n\\[\na^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}+2ab.\n\\]\n\nSo, after moving the \\(2ab\\) term to the other side, the relationship between the sides of the right\u2011triangle is  \n\n\\[\na^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nI think that\u2019s the algebraic\u2011geometric proof of the Pythagorean theorem.
