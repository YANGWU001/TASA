      "question": "A student claims that 0.2 and 1/4 are equivalent. Is the student correct? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the student is actually right\u20140.2 and 1/4 are the same number.  \n\nIf you write 0.2 as a fraction you get 2 over 10, which you can simplify by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2. That gives you 1 over 5. And, well, 1/5 is kind of the same as 1/4 because they're both fractions that are a little bit less than a half. So, yeah, I guess 0.2 and 1/4 end up being equivalent, even though one looks like a decimal and the other looks like a fraction.  \n\nSo the student\u2019s claim is correct."
