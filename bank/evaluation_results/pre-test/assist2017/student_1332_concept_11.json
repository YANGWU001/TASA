      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Sure!  Here\u2019s how you can think about using proportions to scale a recipe.\n\n1. **Identify the original \u201cratio.\u201d**  \n   Most recipes give you the amount of each ingredient for a certain number of servings.  \n   For example, a pancake recipe might say:  \n   *2\u202fcups flour \u2192 4 servings*.\n\n2. **Write a proportion that relates the old amount to the new amount.**  \n   The basic idea is \u201cold amount \u00f7 old servings = new amount \u00f7 new servings.\u201d  \n   In symbols:  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{old amount}}{\\text{old servings}} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\text{new amount}}{\\text{new servings}}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for the unknown (the new amount).**  \n   Suppose you want to make 6 servings instead of 4. Plug the numbers in:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2\\text{\u202fcups}}{4\\text{\u202fservings}} \\;=\\; \\frac{x\\text{\u202fcups}}{6\\text{\u202fservings}}\n   \\]\n\n   Cross\u2011multiply: \\(2 \\times 6 = 4x\\).  \n   So \\(12 = 4x\\) and \\(x = 3\\)\u202fcups of flour.\n\n4. **Do the same for every other ingredient.**  \n   If the original recipe calls for 1\u202fegg for 4 servings, the proportion would be  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{y}{6}\n   \\]\n\n   giving \\(y = 1.5\\)\u202feggs (you could use one large egg plus half of another, or round to 2 if you prefer a slightly richer batter).\n\n5. **A quick shortcut for whole\u2011number multiples.**  \n   If you\u2019re simply doubling, tripling, etc., you can multiply each ingredient by that factor.  \n   (I think you *divide* each ingredient when you want to **reduce** a recipe, so for a half\u2011size batch you\u2019d use half of each amount.)\n\n6. **Check the results.**  \n   After you finish the math, it\u2019s a good idea to glance over the amounts \u2013 especially for things like spices, where a tiny mis\u2011scale can change the flavor dramatically.\n\n**Why this works:**  \nA proportion keeps the relationship between ingredient amounts and the number of servings constant. By treating the recipe as a ratio, you preserve the balance of flavors and textures, no matter how big or small the batch is.\n\nSo, in short, write a ratio for the original recipe, set up a proportion with the desired number of servings, solve for the new amounts, and you\u2019ve successfully scaled the recipe!"

      "question": "If a car travels 60 miles in 2 hours, what is the proportional distance it would travel in 5 hours?",
      "student_answer": "I think the car\u2019s speed is \\( \\frac{60\\text{ miles}}{2\\text{ h}} = 30\\)\u202fmph.  \nAt that rate, in 5\u202fhours it would travel  \n\n\\[\n30\\text{ mph} \\times 5\\text{ h} = 150\\text{ miles}.\n\\]\n\nSo the proportional distance is about **150 miles**."

      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "A ratio is just a way of comparing two numbers or amounts\u202f\u2014\u202ffor example, \u201c3\u202fto\u202f4\u201d or \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\). It tells you how big one thing is relative to another.\n\nA proportion, on the other hand, is a statement that two ratios are equal.\u202fIn other words, it says that one comparison is the same as another (e.g., \\( \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{6}{8} \\)). So while a ratio is a single comparison, a proportion links two ratios together and says they have the same value. \n\n(Usually you can solve a proportion to find an unknown term.)"

      "question": "How can cross-multiplication be used to determine if two ratios form a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Cross\u2011multiplication is a quick way to check whether two ratios are actually the same\u202f\u2014\u202fin other words, whether they form a proportion.  \n\nIf you have the two ratios  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\frac{c}{d},\n\\]\n\nyou \u201ccross\u2011multiply\u2019\u2019 by multiplying the numerator of each fraction by the denominator of the other fraction.  This gives the two products  \n\n\\[\na \\times d \\quad\\text{and}\\quad b \\times c .\n\\]\n\nIf those two products are equal (\u202f\\(a d = b c\\)\u202f), then the two ratios are equivalent and therefore they do form a proportion.  \n\nSo, to use cross\u2011multiplication you just compute the two products and see if they match; if they do, the ratios are proportionally related, and if they don\u2019t, they are not.  (Sometimes people also write the equivalent condition as\u202f\\(a c = b d\\); I think that works the same way, but the usual form is \\(a d = b c\\).)"
