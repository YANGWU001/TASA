  "feedback": "The student shows a limited understanding of equations and their properties. Most answers are incorrect or lack clarity and precision. The student confuses key concepts, such as the definition of an equation and the role of dependent variables. There is some understanding of the concept of no solution, but overall, the student needs to strengthen their grasp of mathematical definitions and problem-solving techniques.",

      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think an equation is kind of like a list of numbers that you have to solve. Like, you write down some numbers and then you try to find the answer that makes the list work. I'm not really sure, but maybe that's what it means."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation is basically just an expression that has an equals sign, and an expression is something that doesn\u2019t even have variables\u2014just plain numbers. So equations are \u201cequal\u2011things\u201d while expressions are just raw numbers."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we balance both sides of an equation is mostly just to keep it looking neat and symmetrical.\u202fYou want the same number of terms or the same kind of symbols on each side, so the equation looks balanced, kind of like a picture that\u2019s centered.\u202fIf you don\u2019t do that, the equation might look \u201clopsided,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t really change the actual numbers or the solution.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011life situation could be something like driving a car.  If you let\u202fD be the distance you travel,\u202fS be your speed, and\u202fT be the time you drive, then you could write an equation like  \n\n\\[\nD = S + T\n\\]\n\nto represent the scenario.  (I'm not really sure if that\u2019s the right way to set it up, but that\u2019s what comes to mind.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 when an equation has no solution it means that there actually aren\u2019t any numbers that make the equation true, so you can\u2019t find a value for the variable\u2026 or maybe it just means the equation is impossible to solve because it\u2019s too hard. I\u2019m not really sure, but probably it just means there\u2019s nothing that works for it."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you usually check a solution by drawing the graph of the equation and then seeing if the point that represents the \u201csolution\u201d actually lies on that graph. If the point is on the curve, then the solution works; if it\u2019s off the curve, it doesn\u2019t satisfy the equation.  (I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole point of inverse operations is kind of\u2026 to make the equation look nicer? Like, if you have a plus sign you use a minus sign to\u2026 I guess you\u2019re supposed to do the opposite thing to \u201cundo\u201d something, but I\u2019m not really sure how that actually helps solve the equation. Maybe you just pick any operation that looks like the opposite and hope it works? I\u2019m pretty confused, so\u2026 sorry if that\u2019s not right."
