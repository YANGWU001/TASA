  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of area concepts, particularly in distinguishing between area and perimeter, and in calculating the area of triangles, squares, and parallelograms. However, there are significant errors in the formulas for rectangles and circles, and the final area calculation for the garden is incorrect. Overall, the student has grasped the basic principles but needs to review specific formulas and calculations.",

      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "I think the main difference is that **area** measures the amount of\u202fspace\u202finside a shape (so we use square units like cm\u00b2 or in\u00b2), while **perimeter** measures the total length of the boundary that goes around the shape (so we use linear units like cm or in).  \n\nUsually the area will be a larger\u2011looking number than the perimeter, but that isn\u2019t a rule\u2014some small shapes can have a perimeter that\u2019s bigger than their area. In short: area = \u201chow much surface\u201d; perimeter = \u201chow far around\u201d."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "The unit of area is written in \u201csquare\u201d units because area is found by multiplying two linear measurements.  \nWhen you calculate the area of a shape (for example, length\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth for a rectangle), each dimension is measured in a unit of length (metres, centimeters, inches, etc.). Multiplying those two length units gives you a unit that is the product of the two, which is written as the length unit squared \u2013 e.g.,\u202fm\u00b2,\u202fcm\u00b2,\u202fin\u00b2.  \n\nSo the \u201csquare\u201d in the unit name just reflects that you have taken the product of two lengths, producing a two\u2011dimensional measure."

      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "One everyday situation where calculating area is important is when you\u2019re putting carpet (or tile, vinyl flooring, etc.) in a room.\u202fYou need to know the floor\u2019s area so you can buy the right amount of material\u2014carpet and most floor coverings are sold by the square\u2011metre (or square\u2011foot). If you underestimate the area you might end up short on carpet and have to make another purchase; if you over\u2011estimate you waste money on extra material. So figuring out the floor\u2019s area helps you plan the project and stay within budget."
