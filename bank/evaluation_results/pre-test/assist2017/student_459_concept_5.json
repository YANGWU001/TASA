      "question": "What is the formula to calculate the area of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area of a rectangle is\u2026 maybe the perimeter formula? So it would be **2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(length\u202f+\u202fwidth)**."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is 8 cm and the width is 5 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area would be the sum of the sides, so maybe \\(8 + 5 = 13\\)\u202fcm\u00b2."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me try to explain\u2026 I think area is kind of like the \u201cedge\u201d of a shape, you know, the total length around it, while perimeter is the amount of space it covers inside. So, for example, if you have a rectangle, the area would be the sum of all the sides\u2014so you\u2019d add the length and the width together\u2014and the perimeter would be the number of square units inside the rectangle. \n\nIn other words, area tells you how far around the shape goes, and perimeter tells you how much stuff can fit inside it. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is calculated by just multiplying the base and the height. So I\u2019d say the area is  \n\n\\(10 \\text{ cm} \\times 6 \\text{ cm} = 60 \\text{ cm}^2\\).  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I got."

      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the area of a circle is just the radius times pi.  \n\nSo I\u2019d say the formula is  \n\n**Area\u202f\u2248\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fr**  \n\n(you just multiply the radius by\u202f\u03c0)."

      "question": "A square has a side length of 4 meters. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the area is about 8\u202fm\u00b2."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we always write area in \u201csquare\u201d units is kind of\u2026 because we\u2019re measuring a flat thing, so we have to use a shape that looks like a square. Like, if you have a rectangle or a triangle you just pretend it\u2019s a little square and then you write the answer in square\u2011meters or square\u2011feet.  \n\nI guess it\u2019s also because the formula for area is length\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth, so you end up multiplying two lengths together and that somehow makes the unit a \u201csquare\u201d of the original length unit.  \n\n\u2026or maybe it\u2019s because the unit is squared to show that we\u2019re dealing with two dimensions instead of one. I\u2019m not really sure, but I think that\u2019s why they always put the little \u201c2\u201d up there.  \n\nSo basically, it\u2019s just a convention to remind us that area is a two\u2011dimensional measurement, and that\u2019s why we use square units. (Hope that makes sense.)"

      "question": "If a parallelogram has a base of 12 cm and a height of 7 cm, what is its area?",

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one real\u2011life place where you\u2019d need to calculate area is when you\u2019re figuring out how fast a car is going.\u202fYou\u2019d first find the area of the road that the car traveled across, and then use that to work out the speed.\u202fThe idea is that a bigger road area would let the car go faster, so knowing the area tells you how quickly you can get from point\u202fA to point\u202fB.  \n\nI\u2019m not entirely sure, but the reason it\u2019s important is that without the area you wouldn\u2019t be able to set the car\u2019s speed limit correctly.\u202fSo you\u2019d have to measure the road\u2019s surface area first, then you could decide how fast the car should be allowed to travel."
