  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the order of operations, particularly in identifying the correct use of parentheses and the need to perform operations in a specific order. However, there are significant misunderstandings in several answers, especially regarding the order of operations and the results of calculations. The student should focus on practicing the correct application of PEMDAS and double-checking calculations.",

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain why parentheses are used in mathematical expressions when applying the order of operations.",
      "student_answer": "Parentheses are put around part of a math expression so that the operations inside the brackets are done **before** anything outside of them.\u202fBecause the order\u2011of\u2011operations rules give parentheses the highest priority, they let us tell the calculator (or ourselves) exactly which numbers should be combined first, which is why they\u2019re so important for getting the right answer.\n\nIn addition to setting the priority, parentheses are also used to **group** numbers that belong together.  For example, in\u202f\\(3\u202f\u00d7\u202f(2\u202f+\u202f4)\\) we first add 2 and 4, then multiply the result by 3.  If we left out the parentheses and wrote \\(3\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f+\u202f4\\), we would do the multiplication first (3\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f6) and then add 4, giving a different answer (10 instead of 18).\n\nSometimes people think parentheses also tell you to **multiply** the whole group by something extra, but that\u2019s not true \u2013 the parentheses themselves don\u2019t change the operation, they just force the inside to be evaluated first.  The actual operation that follows the closing parenthesis (like a plus, minus, times, or division sign) is what determines how the result of the grouped part is used.  \n\nSo, in short, we use parentheses to control the order in which the steps are carried out and to keep related terms together, which helps avoid mistakes that come from the normal precedence rules."

      "student_answer": "**Step\u2011by\u2011step (my attempt):**\n\n1. First I\u2019ll deal with the parentheses:  \n   \\[\n   (6 \\div 3)=2\n   \\]\n\n2. Next I handle the multiplication before the addition/subtraction (according to the order of operations):  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 2 = 8\n   \\]\n\n3. Now I replace those parts in the original expression:  \n   \\[\n   3 + 8 - 2\n   \\]\n\n4. I think the addition comes next, so:  \n   \\[\n   3 + 8 = 11\n   \\]\n\n5. Finally I subtract the last term:  \n   \\[\n   11 - 2 = 9\n   \\]\n\n**Result (what I get):** \\(9\\)\n\n---\n\n*Actually, I\u2019m a bit unsure about the order after the multiplication \u2013 maybe I should have added the 3 first? If I did \\(3+4 = 7\\) then \\(7 \\times 2 = 14\\) and finally \\(14 - 2 = 12\\). So the answer could be 12, but I think the correct way is the first method, giving **9**.*"

      "student_answer": "The problem isn\u2019t really an error in the arithmetic; it\u2019s an error in how the expression was written.\u202fThe calculation 3\u202f+\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 should be interpreted as (3\u202f+\u202f5)\u202f\u00d7\u202f2, which does give 16. In other words, the \u201cmistake\u201d is that the expression should have been written with parentheses to show the intended order, not that the order\u2011of\u2011operations rule was applied incorrectly."
