      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Proportions are just a way of saying \u201cthis part compared to that part\u201d and they let us keep the same \u201cshape\u201d of a problem while changing its size.  When you scale a recipe you keep the ratios between all the ingredients the same, but you change the overall amount.\n\n**Basic set\u2011up**\n\n1. Write the original number of servings as a ratio with each ingredient.  \n   *Example:* The original recipe makes **4 servings** and calls for **2\u202fcups of flour**.  The ratio of flour to servings is  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{flour}}{\\text{servings}}=\\frac{2\\text{ cups}}{4}= \\frac{1}{2}\\text{ cup per serving}.\n   \\]\n\n2. Decide how many servings you want.  Say you need **6 servings**.  \n   Set up the proportion so the \u201cper\u2011serving\u201d part stays the same:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{flour}}{6\\text{ servings}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{ cup per serving}.\n   \\]\n\n3. Solve for the new amount of flour:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{flour}=6 \\times \\frac{1}{2}=3\\text{ cups}.\n   \\]  \n   (In other words, you multiply the old amount by the scaling factor **6\u202f\u00f7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f1.5**.)\n\n**General steps you can copy\u2011paste for any ingredient**\n\n| Step | What you do |\n|------|-------------|\n| 1.   | Write the original amount (A) and the original servings (S\u2081). |\n| 2.   | Write the desired servings (S\u2082). |\n| 3.   | Set up the proportion \u202fA\u202f/\u202fS\u2081\u202f =\u202f\u202f?\u202f/\u202fS\u2082. |\n| 4.   | Solve for the unknown amount:\u202f ?\u202f=\u202fA\u202f\u00d7\u202f(S\u2082\u202f/\u202fS\u2081). |\n| 5.   | Do this for every ingredient. |\n\n**A couple of common pitfalls (and why they\u2019re easy to miss)**  \n\n* **Mixing up the direction of the ratio.**  If you write the proportion as \u202fS\u2081\u202f/\u202fA\u202f =\u202fS\u2082\u202f/\u202f?, you\u2019ll end up dividing when you should be multiplying, which gives the wrong amount.  \n* **Forgetting to keep units consistent.**  If the original recipe lists the butter in tablespoons but you plug the number into a cup\u2011based calculation, the answer will be off.  \n* **Assuming you also have to scale cooking time or temperature linearly.**  Usually you only change the ingredient amounts; the oven temperature stays the same, and cooking time only changes a little (often not exactly in proportion).  \n\n**Quick example with a whole recipe**\n\nOriginal (4 servings):  \n\n* 2\u202fcups flour  \n* 1\u202fcup sugar  \n* \u00bd\u202fcup butter  \n* 1\u202fegg  \n\nWanted (10 servings): scaling factor\u202f=\u202f10\u202f\u00f7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f2.5  \n\n* Flour: 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2.5\u202f=\u202f5\u202fcups  \n* Sugar: 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f2.5\u202f=\u202f2.5\u202fcups  \n* Butter: 0.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f2.5\u202f=\u202f1.25\u202fcups (\u2248\u202f1\u202f\u00bc\u202fcups)  \n* Eggs: 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f2.5\u202f\u2248\u202f2\u00bd\u202feggs \u2192 you\u2019d round to 2 or 3 eggs and maybe adjust a bit.\n\n**Bottom line**\n\nYou set up a proportion that keeps the \u201cper\u2011serving\u201d ratio constant, solve for the new amounts, and then double\u2011check that you didn\u2019t invert the fraction or forget units.  That\u2019s basically how proportions let you scale any recipe up or down."
