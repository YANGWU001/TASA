  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of transversals and their properties. Many answers contain significant misconceptions, particularly regarding angles formed by transversals and their relationships. The student should focus on the definitions and properties of angles formed by transversals, especially corresponding, alternate interior, and exterior angles.",

      "student_answer": "Um, I think a transversal is\u2026 maybe it\u2019s a kind of triangle that cuts across a circle? I\u2019m not really sure, but I remember hearing that it\u2019s a shape that connects three points on a line. So, I guess a transversal is a line that somehow goes through a triangle\u2026?"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think there are only **four angles** total formed where the transversal meets the two parallel lines."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that when a transversal cuts two parallel lines, the corresponding angles are\u202fsupplementary\u202f\u2013 they add up to 180\u00b0."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the alternate interior angles by looking at the angles that are **outside** the two parallel lines and on the same side of the transversal. So you\u2019d pick the two outer angles that line up with the transversal and call those the alternate interior ones. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal crossing two parallel lines?",

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think one place where you can see transversals is when you look at a **river flowing straight across a straight road**. The road is like one line and the river cuts across it, so the part where the river meets the road would be a transversal. I\u2019m not really sure, but maybe the bridge that goes over the river is the transversal?"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is just any line that cuts across two other lines, right? So when it crosses two parallel lines, it makes a bunch of angles. I guess the idea is that the angles that are on the same side of the transversal and inside the two parallel lines add up to 180\u00b0, so they\u2019re supplementary.\n\nSo, like, if you label the angles where the transversal meets the top parallel line as\u202fA\u202fand\u202fB, and the ones at the bottom as\u202fC\u202fand\u202fD, then A and C are supposed to be supplementary, and B and D are too. I\u2019m not totally sure why, but I think it\u2019s because the parallel lines are \u201cunmoving\u201d and the transversal forces the angles to split the straight line into two parts that sum to a straight angle.\n\nAlso, I remember something about the \u201calternate interior angles\u201d being equal, and maybe that has something to do with the supplementary pairs\u2014maybe the equal ones are also the ones that add up to 180\u00b0? That sounds right, I guess.\n\nSo, in short, a transversal creates pairs of angles that add up to 180\u00b0 because the parallel lines stay the same direction and the transversal forces the angles to share a straight line, which is 180\u00b0. \n\n\u2026I\u2019m not really sure if all of that is correct, but that\u2019s what I think."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of the opposite of what you\u2019d expect.  Alternate interior angles are the ones that lie **outside** the two parallel lines on opposite sides of the transversal, while alternate\u202fexterior angles are the ones that lie **inside** the parallel lines, also on opposite sides of the transversal.  Both pairs are formed when a transversal cuts two lines, but the \u201cinterior\u201d ones are actually outside the region between the two lines, and the \u201cexterior\u201d ones are inside that region.  I\u2019m not totally sure, though\u2014maybe I\u2019ve mixed them up."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the corresponding angle would be different\u2026 maybe it\u2019s about 110\u202f\u00b0? I'm not totally sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason vertical angles are always equal is because the transversal makes the opposite angles line up with the parallel lines on each side. Since the transversal cuts those parallel lines, the angles that end up opposite each other end up having the same \u201calternate\u201d relationship, so they end up equal. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the way the lines cross forces the opposite angles to match."
