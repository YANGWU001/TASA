      "question": "What is the formula to calculate the area of a rectangle?",

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "I think the basic idea is that **area** and **perimeter** describe two different things about a shape.\n\n- **Area** is the amount of space that\u2019s inside the shape.  It\u2019s usually found by multiplying lengths (for example, length\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth for a rectangle) and it\u2019s expressed in *square* units (like cm\u00b2, in\u00b2, m\u00b2, etc.).  \n\n- **Perimeter** is the total distance you would travel if you walked all the way around the edge of the shape.  You add up the lengths of all the sides, and it\u2019s expressed in *linear* units (like cm, inches, meters, etc.).  \n\nSo, in short, area tells you how much \u201cstuff\u201d fits inside, while perimeter tells you how long the boundary is.  (Sometimes I get confused and think area is measured in regular centimeters, but actually it\u2019s the square\u2011centimeter type of unit.)"

      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "I think the area of a circle is just \u03c0 times the radius, so it would be  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}= \\pi r\\,\n\\] \n\n(I'm not completely confident about that, though.)"

    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "I think the reason we always write the unit of area as a square unit is because area comes from measuring two dimensions\u202f\u2014\u202flength and width.\u202fWhen you multiply a length (say, meters) by another length (meters again), the result is meters\u202f\u00d7\u202fmeters, which we write as meters squared (m\u00b2). In other words, the unit of area is the unit of length \u201csquared,\u201d so we express it as a square unit like cm\u00b2, ft\u00b2, etc."

      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "One everyday situation where we need to calculate area is when we\u2019re buying flooring (like carpet, laminate, or tiles) for a room.\u202fYou have to know the floor\u2019s surface area so you can order the right amount of material\u2014enough to cover the whole space but not so much that you waste money and have a lot of leftovers.\n\nFor a rectangular room you\u2019d (usually) multiply the length by the width to get the area in square\u202ffeet or square\u202fmetres.\u202fThat number tells you roughly how many square\u2011foot (or square\u2011meter) panels of flooring you\u2019ll need.\u202fIf you\u2019re using tiles you might also add a little extra (often called \u201coverage\u201d) to cover cuts and mistakes, but the basic area calculation is the starting point. \n\nSo, calculating the floor area helps you purchase the correct quantity of flooring material, which saves both cost and time."
