  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of unit conversion, correctly converting some units while making significant errors in others. The explanations provided show some awareness of the importance of unit conversion, but they lack clarity and accuracy. More practice with specific conversions and a clearer understanding of the concepts would benefit the student.",

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain why unit conversion is important in scientific experiments.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think unit conversion is kind of important in experiments because it\u2026 lets you change the numbers so they look nicer, you know? Like if you measured something in meters and then you convert it to centimeters, the result is a bigger number, which makes the data look more impressive.  \n\nAlso, I guess it helps scientists talk to each other because everyone can use the same \u201cbig\u201d numbers instead of tiny ones. If you don\u2019t convert, the results might be too small and people could think the experiment failed.  \n\nSo, basically, converting units is mostly about making the figures easier to read and making the paper look professional. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

      "question": "Describe the process of converting units between different measurement systems, such as metric to imperial.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole thing is kind of\u2026 you just have to look up a conversion factor and then do some arithmetic, but I\u2019m not totally sure.  \n\nUsually you start by writing the value you want to change down, and then you either multiply or divide by the \u201cconversion constant\u201d that relates the two units.\u202fFor example, I remember that 1\u202finch is about 2.54\u202fcentimeters, so to go from centimeters to inches you\u2019d **multiply** by 2.54, right? And then to go from meters to feet you\u2019d use\u2026maybe 3.28? I guess you just multiply the meters by 3.28 to get feet.  \n\nSometimes you have to do the opposite\u2014if you\u2019re going from imperial to metric you\u2019d divide by the same number.\u202fSo if you have 10\u202ffeet and you want meters, you\u2019d divide 10 by 3.28 and get about 3\u202fmeters.  \n\nI think the steps are:  \n\n1. Find the right conversion factor (like 2.54\u202fcm/in, 3.28\u202fft/m, 0.45\u202fkg/lb, whatever).  \n2. Decide whether you need to multiply or divide (I\u2019m not always sure which one, but I think you multiply when you\u2019re going from the smaller unit to the bigger one).  \n3. Do the calculation and you\u2019re done.  \n\n\u2026maybe you also have to double\u2011check with a calculator because it\u2019s easy to get the factor backwards.  That\u2019s all I can remember."
