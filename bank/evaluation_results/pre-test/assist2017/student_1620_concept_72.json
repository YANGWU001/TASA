      "student_answer": "Um, I think for an odd number of data points you just add up all the values and then divide by how many there are\u2014that gives you the median. (So basically you compute the average of the whole set.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when you have an even number of values you just look at the two middle numbers and pick the smaller (or lower) one as the median, rather than doing anything else."

      "question": "Explain the difference between the median and the mean.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the median and the mean are kind of the same thing, but they\u2019re used in different situations.  \n\nThe **mean** is, like, the \u201caverage\u201d you get by adding up all the numbers and then\u2026 uh\u2026 dividing by the number of values, right?\u202fThat gives you a single number that represents the whole set.  \n\nThe **median** is, I guess, the middle number when you line up the data from smallest to biggest.\u202fBut sometimes you have to add the two middle numbers together and then divide by two\u2014wait, that sounds more like the mean again.\u202fMaybe the median is actually the average of the lowest and highest values?\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure.  \n\nSo, basically, the mean is the \u201ctypical\u201d value you calculate, and the median is the \u201cmiddle\u201d value, but they end up being the same most of the time.\u202f\u2026I think that\u2019s the difference."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If a data set has outliers, why might the median be a better measure of central tendency than the mean?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the median can be better when there are outliers because the mean gets pulled toward those extreme values. The median just picks the middle number after you sort the data, so those really high or low points don\u2019t change it as much.  \n\n...but\u2026 I\u2019m not completely sure\u2014maybe the median also takes every value into account somehow, which could help it stay stable? Anyway, I guess the idea is that the median isn\u2019t as sensitive to a few really big or small numbers."

      "question": "Provide an example of a situation where calculating the median would be more useful than calculating the mean.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe a situation where you\u2019d want to use the median instead of the mean is when you\u2019re looking at something like the daily temperature over a single day. Since the temperature can jump up and down a lot, the median would give you a better \u201caverage\u201d temperature for the day than the mean would. (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"
