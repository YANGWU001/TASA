      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter would be the sum of all sides, so maybe\u2026\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(8\u202f+\u202f3)\u202f\u2248\u202f24\u202funits?  (I\u2019m not completely sure.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think perimeter is kind of like the amount of space inside a shape, you know, like the area that it covers. So maybe it\u2019s the total amount of \u201cstuff\u201d inside the shape rather than the edges. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess it has something to do with the inside part of the shape."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is about **20\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is about 12\u202fmeters."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter and the area are kind of the same thing, just measured differently. Like, the perimeter is the total length around the shape, but you can also think of it as the \u201cinside\u201d space if you square it, so it\u2019s kind of like the area but in linear units instead of square units. So basically they both tell you how big the polygon is, just one is in \u201cunits\u201d and the other is in \u201cunits squared,\u201d but they\u2019re really just two ways of looking at the same measurement."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter might be... maybe 18 inches? I'm not really sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter would be \u2026 maybe 20\u202fcm? I'm not totally sure, but that sounds right."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of important because it tells you how much fence you\u2019ll need to go all the way around the garden.\u202fSo if you know the length and the width, you add them up\u2026 or maybe you multiply them?\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the total length of fence you have to buy is based on the perimeter of the rectangle."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter (well, the \u201ccircumference\u201d) of a circle is given by the area formula, so I\u2019d use  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = \\pi r^{2}\n\\]  \n\n\u2014 with \\(r = 7\\)\u202fcm.  (So it would be \\(\\pi \\times 7^{2}\\) cm.)"
