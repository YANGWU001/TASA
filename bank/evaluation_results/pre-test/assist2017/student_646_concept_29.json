That would be \\(28 \u00f7 2 = 14\\) and \\(72 \u00f7 2 = 36\\), so the fraction would be \\(14/36\\). Hmm, I\u2019m not really sure\u2026 \n\nProbably the simplified result is **\\(7/24\\)**."

      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we multiply the numerator and the denominator separately is because when you\u2019re finding a part of a part you have to \u201cscale\u201d both the top\u202fand the bottom at the same time.  \nSo if you have \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) and you want a \\(\\frac{c}{d}\\)\u2011th piece of it, you just do the multiplication on the tops (\\(a\\times c\\)) and the bottoms (\\(b\\times d\\)).  \nMultiplying the tops together gives you the new \u201chow many pieces\u201d and multiplying the bottoms together gives you the new \u201csize of each piece.\u201d  \n\nIn other words, you treat each fraction as a separate whole\u2011number ratio, and then you combine the two ratios by multiplying the numerators to get the new numerator and the denominators to get the new denominator. That way the overall value stays consistent with the idea of taking a fraction of a fraction.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I\u2019m supposed to multiply the numerators and the denominators, right? So I\u2019ll do:\n\n\\( \\frac{5}{6} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{5 \\times 3}{6 \\times 4} = \\frac{15}{24}\\).\n\nThen\u2026 I guess I should simplify that. Maybe I can divide both top and bottom by 3? That would give \\( \\frac{15 \\div 3}{24 \\div 3} = \\frac{5}{8}\\). \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure if I can simplify further. Maybe I could also try dividing by 2 instead? If I did that, I\u2019d get \\( \\frac{15 \\div 2}{24 \\div 2} = \\frac{7.5}{12}\\), which doesn\u2019t look right.  \n\nSo, I think the simplified answer is \\( \\frac{5}{8}\\). \n\n(\u2026or maybe it\u2019s \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)?

      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the main difference is that when you **add** fractions you **add the numerators** and keep the denominator the same, while when you **multiply** fractions you **multiply the denominators** and keep the numerator the same.  \n\nFor example, if we add 1/4 and 1/6, I would do:  \n\n\\(1/4 + 1/6 = (1+1)/4 = 2/4 = 1/2\\).  \n\nBut if we multiply the same fractions, I think we just multiply the denominators:  \n\n\\(1/4 \\times 1/6 = 1/(4 \\times 6) = 1/24\\).  \n\nSo basically addition changes the numerator, and multiplication changes the denominator.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it.)"
