  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a significant misunderstanding of supplementary angles. They incorrectly identify the sum of supplementary angles, confuse supplementary with complementary angles, and fail to apply the definitions correctly in various scenarios. The only correct answer relates to the definition of supplementary angles forming a straight angle, but even that contains some inaccuracies. Overall, the student needs to review the definitions and properties of supplementary angles thoroughly.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the supplementary angle would be about **100\u00b0**."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think they\u2019re **not** supplementary. Even though each one is 90\u00b0,\u202fthey add up to 180\u00b0, but that actually makes them complementary, not supplementary. So two 90\u00b0 angles don\u2019t count as a supplementary pair."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, let me try to explain\u2026 I think supplementary angles are the ones that add up to\u202f90\u202fdegrees, you know, like a right angle. And complementary angles\u2026 those are the ones that add up to\u202f180\u202fdegrees, kind of like a straight line. So, basically, the difference is just the total amount they sum to \u2013 one is 90\u202fdegrees and the other is 180\u202fdegrees. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I remember it."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Two angles are supplementary. If one angle is x\u00b0, express the measure of the other angle in terms of x.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the other angle would be something like \\(180^\\circ + x\\).  I\u2019m not completely sure, but I guess you add 180 to the first angle\u2019s measure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles actually **can** be supplementary.  \nSince an obtuse angle is anything larger than 90\u00b0, you could pick, for example, a 100\u00b0 angle and a 120\u00b0 angle. Those two add up to 220\u00b0, which is more than 180\u00b0, but I guess the \u201csupplementary\u201d thing just means the two together make a straight line, and a straight line can be longer than 180\u00b0 when you count the extra space.  \n\nSo, yeah, two obtuse angles can be put together and still be called supplementary because their sum is big enough to cover the straight\u2011line idea. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I think.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the angles might be 45\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. I\u2019m not really sure, but if one angle is twice the other\u2026 maybe 45\u00b0\u202f+\u202f2\u00b745\u00b0 = 135\u00b0, which is close enough to 180\u00b0? So I guess the two angles are about 45 degrees and 90 degrees."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Determine if the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are supplementary. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are **not** supplementary.  \n\nMy reasoning (though I might be mixing things up) is that supplementary angles have to add up to **200\u00b0**, not 180\u00b0, and 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0 only gives 180\u00b0, which is short of the required sum. So because their total is less than 200\u00b0, they can\u2019t be supplementary. \n\nI\u2019m probably getting the definition wrong, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is that when you take any two angles that add up to 180\u00b0, you automatically get a straight line because one of the angles \u201cfills in\u201d the missing part of the other.\u202fIn other words, one of the angles must be a right angle and the other angle is just the leftover so that together they make a straight angle.\u202fSince a right angle is 90\u00b0, the other angle would have to be 90\u00b0\u202fplus whatever extra you need to reach 180\u00b0, so the two together always line up in a straight line.\u202fThat\u2019s why any two supplementary angles are said to form a straight angle."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if you add 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 you get something like 190\u00b0. Since that isn\u2019t 180\u00b0, they wouldn\u2019t be supplementary. (I think that\u2019s how it works.)"
