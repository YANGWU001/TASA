      "question": "What does the slope in a linear equation represent in the context of a graph?",
      "student_answer": "The slope of a linear equation tells you **how steep the line is** and **how the\u202fy\u2011value changes for each unit change in\u202fx**. In other words, it is the \u201crise over run\u201d (\u0394y\u202f\u2044\u202f\u0394x), the rate of change of the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable. On a graph, a larger absolute slope makes the line steeper; a positive slope means the line rises as you move to the right, while a negative slope means it falls."

Plugging \\(x = 0\\) into the equation gives  \n\n\\[\ny = m(0) + b = b.\n\\]\n\nThus the coordinate of the y\u2011intercept is \\((0,\\;b)\\). So, to find the y\u2011intercept, simply read off the constant term \\(b\\) (or set \\(x = 0\\) and solve for \\(y\\))."

      "student_answer": "Two linear equations are **parallel** when the lines they represent never intersect.  \nIn the slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\), this happens exactly when the two equations have the **same slope** (\\(m\\)) but **different y\u2011intercepts** (\\(b\\)).  \n\nSo, for example  \n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny &= 2x + 3 \\\\\ny &= 2x - 5\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nboth have slope \\(m = 2\\); because their intercepts (3 and \u20135) differ, the lines are parallel and will stay the same distance apart for all values of\u202f\\(x\\).  \n\nIn general, if the equations are written in standard form \\(Ax + By = C\\), the condition for parallelism is that the ratios \\(\\frac{A}{B}\\) are equal for the two equations (i.e., the coefficients of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are proportional) while the constants \\(C\\) are not proportional. This again reflects identical slopes but distinct positions."

Since the x\u2011coordinate on the y\u2011axis is always\u202f0, you set \\(x = 0\\) in the equation:\n\n\\[\ny = 5(0) + 7 = 7\n\\]\n\nSo the line meets the y\u2011axis at the point \\((0,7)\\).
