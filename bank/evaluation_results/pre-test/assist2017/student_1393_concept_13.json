      "question": "What does the slope in a linear equation represent in the context of a graph?",
      "student_answer": "The slope of a linear equation is the number that tells you how steep the line is on the coordinate plane.  In practical terms it represents the **rate of change** of the dependent variable (usually\u202f\\(y\\)) with respect to the independent variable (usually\u202f\\(x\\)).  \n\n- **Numerically**, the slope is the \u201crise over run\u201d:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{slope}=m=\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\n\\]\n\nthe change in \\(y\\) divided by the change in \\(x\\) between any two points on the line.  \n\n- **Graphically**, a larger absolute value of the slope means the line tilts more sharply; a positive slope means the line rises as you move to the right, while a negative slope means it falls.  \n\n- **Contextually**, the slope tells you how much the output ( \\(y\\) ) increases (or decreases) for each unit increase in the input ( \\(x\\) ).  For example, in a distance\u2011time graph the slope is the speed, and in a cost\u2011quantity graph the slope is the marginal cost per additional unit."

      "question": "How can you determine the y-intercept from the linear equation y = mx + b?",
      "student_answer": "The y\u2011intercept of a line is the point where the graph crosses the y\u2011axis.  \nOn the y\u2011axis the \\(x\\)-coordinate is always \\(0\\).  \n\nStarting with the slope\u2011intercept form  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nset \\(x = 0\\):\n\n\\[\ny = m(0) + b = b.\n\\]\n\nThus the y\u2011intercept is the constant term \\(b\\). In coordinate form the intercept is the point \\((0,\\;b)\\).  \n\nSo to determine it directly from the equation, simply read off the term that is **not** multiplied by \\(x\\); that number is the y\u2011intercept."

      "student_answer": "Two linear equations are **parallel** when their graphs are straight lines that never intersect.  \n\nFor equations written in slope\u2011intercept form  \n\n\\[\ny = m_1x + b_1 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad y = m_2x + b_2,\n\\]\n\nthe lines are parallel **iff** they have the same slope but different y\u2011intercepts:\n\n\\[\nm_1 = m_2 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad b_1 \\neq b_2.\n\\]\n\nIf the equations are given in standard form \\(Ax + By = C\\), you can rewrite each in slope\u2011intercept form by solving for \\(y\\); the condition for parallelism is again that the coefficients of \\(x\\) relative to \\(y\\) are proportional:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A_1}{B_1} = \\frac{A_2}{B_2} \\qquad\\text{(same slope)},\n\\]\nwhile the constants on the right side are not in the same proportion:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C_1}{B_1} \\neq \\frac{C_2}{B_2}.\n\\]\n\nIn short, parallel linear equations describe lines with identical slopes that are distinct (different intercepts), so the lines never meet."

      "student_answer": "To tell whether the slope of a line is positive or negative just by looking at its graph, focus on how the line moves as you go from left to right:\n\n1. **Identify two points** on the line (any two will do). It\u2019s often easiest to pick points where the line crosses the grid lines so you can read their coordinates exactly.\n\n2. **Observe the direction of movement**:\n   - **Positive slope** \u2013 As you move **rightward** (increasing\u202fx), the line **rises** (the\u202fy\u2011coordinate gets larger). On the graph this looks like a line that goes **upward** from left to right.  \n   - **Negative slope** \u2013 As you move **rightward**, the line **falls** (the\u202fy\u2011coordinate gets smaller). On the graph this looks like a line that goes **downward** from left to right.\n\n3. **Visual shortcuts**:\n   - If the line tilts upward like \u201c/\u201d, the slope is positive.  \n   - If the line tilts downward like \u201c\\\u201d, the slope is negative.  \n   - A **horizontal** line (flat) has slope\u202f0 (neither positive nor negative).  \n   - A **vertical** line does not represent a function of\u202fx, so its slope is undefined\u2014not positive or negative.\n\n4. **Optional check with rise\u2011over\u2011run**:  \n   - Pick two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) with \\(x_2 > x_1\\).  \n   - Compute the \u201crise\u201d \\(y_2 - y_1\\) and the \u201crun\u201d \\(x_2 - x_1\\).  \n   - If \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1) > 0\\), the slope is positive; if it\u2019s \\<\u202f0, the slope is negative.\n\nSo, simply look at the line\u2019s tilt from left to right: upward tilt \u2192 positive slope; downward tilt \u2192 negative slope."

Replace \\(x\\) with 4:  \n   \\(y = 3(4) - 5\\).\n\n3. **Do the arithmetic.**  \n   \\(y = 12 - 5 = 7\\).  \n   So when \\(x = 4\\), the predicted \\(y\\) is 7.\n\nYou can repeat this process for any number of \\(x\\) values:\n\n| \\(x\\) | Calculation | \\(y\\) |\n|------|-------------|------|\n| 0    | \\(y = 3(0) - 5\\) | \\(-5\\) |\n| 1    | \\(y = 3(1) - 5\\) | \\(-2\\) |\n| 2    | \\(y = 3(2) - 5\\) | \\(1\\) |\n| 5    | \\(y = 3(5) - 5\\) | \\(10\\) |\n\n**Why this works:**  \nBecause a linear relationship means the connection between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is constant (the slope). Once you know the slope and the intercept, the formula captures that constant rate of change, allowing you to extrapolate (or interpolate) to any \\(x\\) you choose.\n\n**Quick checklist for prediction**\n\n- \u2705 Ensure the equation is in slope\u2011intercept form (\\(y = mx + b\\)).  \n- \u2705 Plug the desired \\(x\\) value into the equation.  \n- \u2705 Perform the multiplication and addition/subtraction correctly.  \n- \u2705 The result is your predicted \\(y\\).\n\nThat\u2019s all there is to using a linear equation for prediction: substitute, calculate, and read off the result."
