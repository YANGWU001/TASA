  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of equivalent fractions, decimals, and percentages, with most answers correct. However, there are some inaccuracies, such as in Question 1 (0.25 is equivalent to 1/4, not 2/5) and Question 9 (the explanation incorrectly states that 1/4 equals 0.25, while 0.2 equals 1/5). Overall, the student shows solid knowledge but should review the conversions and equivalences more carefully.",
