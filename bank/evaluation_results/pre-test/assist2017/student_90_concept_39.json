Algebraically,\n\n\\[\nx+y \\;\\ge\\; x \\quad\\text{because}\\quad y\\ge 0 .\n\\]\n\nThus, when at least one of the addends is non\u2011negative, the sum is always **greater than or equal to** the larger of the two numbers (it is equal only when the smaller addend is\u202f\\(0\\)).  \n\nIf both numbers are allowed to be negative, the statement need not hold: for example, with\u202f\\(x=5\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(y=-10\\), the sum is \\(-5\\), which is **less** than the larger number\u202f\\(5\\).  Hence the property is valid for non\u2011negative numbers (or more generally, whenever the smaller addend is \u2265\u202f0).  \n\nIn short, adding a non\u2011negative quantity to any number can only keep it the same or increase it, so the sum is always \u2265 the larger addend."
