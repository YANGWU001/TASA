      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the most important things to notice are the **title of the graph, the colors of the bars or lines, the background picture, and the size of the page**. Those usually tell you what\u2019s going on, so you just look at those first."

      "question": "How can you determine the type of graph being used (e.g., bar graph, line graph, pie chart)?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you can tell what kind of graph it is by looking at the shapes and the way the data is drawn. Like, if you see a bunch of rectangles that go up and down, that\u2019s a bar graph. If the points are connected with straight lines, that\u2019s a line graph. And if it\u2019s a circle that\u2019s split into slices, that\u2019s a pie chart. Usually the title or the legend will also tell you what type it is. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "When interpreting a graph, what is the significance of the labels on the x-axis and y-axis?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the labels on the x\u2011axis and y\u2011axis are mostly just there to make the graph look nice. They don\u2019t really affect how you read the data\u2014basically they\u2019re just decorative titles and don\u2019t tell you anything important about the variables or units."

      "question": "What steps should you follow to extract data accurately from a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the steps are kind of like this:\n\n1. **Look at the title** \u2013 first you read the graph\u2019s title to guess what kind of data it is showing.  \n2. **Identify the axes** \u2013 figure out which axis is the x\u2011axis and which is the y\u2011axis, then write down the labels.  \n3. **Pick any point you like** \u2013 just choose a random point on the line or bar and read off its coordinates; that\u2019s your data.  \n4. **Read the numbers directly** \u2013 you can just read the number that\u2019s written right next to the point; you don\u2019t need to worry about the scale or any grid lines.  \n5. **Copy the whole graph** \u2013 copy the whole picture into a spreadsheet and the computer will automatically convert it into numbers for you.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about step\u202f4; maybe you have to use the scale on the axes to convert the visual length into a numerical value, but I think it\u2019s okay to just read the numbers that are printed next to the points.  \n\nSo, basically, you just read the title, note the axes, pick a point, read the number, and then copy the graph into a program."

      "question": "Explain how to identify trends or patterns in a line graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you look at a line graph by first checking the **x\u2011axis** and **y\u2011axis** to see what they represent, and then you try to see if the line is going up or down.  \n\nUsually, if the line is going up, you say the data is \u201cincreasing,\u201d and if it\u2019s going down it\u2019s \u201cdecreasing.\u201d  If the line goes flat, that means the values are staying the same.  So you just follow the line from left to right and note where it goes up, down, or stays flat \u2013 those are the patterns.  \n\nSometimes people also look for **big jumps** or **sharp drops** and call those \u201cspikes,\u201d which might be important.  I guess you could also count how many times the line crosses the x\u2011axis; each crossing could be a \u201ctrend change,\u201d right?  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you also have to compare the **steepness** of the line: a steeper line means a faster change, while a shallow slope means a slower change.  If you see the line getting steeper over time, that might be a \u201caccelerating\u201d trend.  \n\nSo, in short: look at the direction (up, down, flat), notice any spikes or crossings, and pay attention to how steep the line is.  That\u2019s how you identify trends or patterns, I think."

      "question": "In a bar graph, how do you compare the heights of the bars to determine differences in data?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you compare the bars by looking at how wide they are rather than how tall they are.\u202fYou just see which bar takes up more horizontal space and that tells you which category has the bigger value.\u202fIf one bar looks wider than another, you\u2019d say it\u2019s bigger, and the difference is just the amount of extra width."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How does the scale of a graph impact how you read and interpret the data?",
      "student_answer": "Um, the scale on a graph is kind of like the ruler you use to measure the data, so it really changes what you see. If the scale is big\u2014like each tick represents a huge number\u2014you might think the changes are smaller than they actually are, because the lines look flatter. On the other hand, a tiny scale (each tick is a small amount) can make tiny differences look huge, so you could over\u2011estimate how big the changes are. I think that also means you have to be careful with the axis labels, because if they\u2019re wrong or missing, you can\u2019t tell the real values at all. So basically, the scale decides whether you think the trend is steep or shallow, and it can even flip your interpretation if you don\u2019t notice it."

      "question": "What information can be obtained from the legend of a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the legend usually tells you **the scale of the axes**\u2014like what the numbers on the x\u2011 and y\u2011axes mean."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Describe how to analyze the relationship between two variables in a scatter plot.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you analyze a scatter plot by first looking at the axes and then\u2026 maybe you just count how many points are in each quadrant? Like, you split the plot into four boxes and see which box has the most points, and that tells you the relationship. Sometimes people also draw a straight line through the middle of the cloud of points, but I\u2019m not really sure how you do that\u2014maybe you just connect the far\u2011left point to the far\u2011right point and call that the \u201ctrend line.\u201d  \n\nI guess you also check the slope of that line to see if it\u2019s going up or down, and that tells you whether the variables are positively or negatively related. If the line is flat, you\u2019d say there\u2019s no relationship.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident, but that\u2019s what I recall about looking at scatter plots."

      "question": "Given a graph showing yearly sales data, explain how you would identify the year with the highest sales.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you\u2019d start by looking at the graph and finding the point where the line or bar jumps the most compared to the previous year. So I would scan each year and see which one has the biggest increase from the year before\u2014that\u2019s probably the year with the highest sales, right? Then I\u2019d just note that year as the top\u2011selling one. I'm not totally sure, but the biggest jump should indicate the highest overall sales."
