      "student_answer": "The median of a data set is the value that divides the ordered list of observations into two equal halves. In practice you first sort the data.  \n\n- If the number of observations is **odd**, the median is the single middle number.  \n- If the number of observations is **even**, the median is usually taken as the average of the two middle numbers.  \n\nThus the median is the \u201cmiddle\u201d value that separates the lower half of the data from the upper half."

      "student_answer": "To find the median when the data set contains an **odd** number of observations, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Arrange the data in order**  \n   Sort the values from smallest to largest (or largest to smallest \u2013 the order doesn\u2019t matter as long as it\u2019s monotonic).\n\n2. **Identify the middle position**  \n   If the total number of points is \\(n\\) (where \\(n\\) is odd), the position of the median in the ordered list is:  \n\n   \\[\n   \\text{median position} = \\frac{n + 1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Because \\(n\\) is odd, \\((n+1)/2\\) is an integer, so the median is exactly the value at that position.\n\n3. **Read off the median value**  \n   The value occupying that middle position is the median.\n\n---\n\n**Example**\n\nSuppose the data are: 7, 3, 9, 1, 5  \n\n1. Sort: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9  \n2. \\(n = 5\\) (odd). Median position = \\((5 + 1)/2 = 3\\).  \n3. The 3rd value in the sorted list is **5**, so the median is 5."

      "student_answer": "To find the median when there are an **even** number of observations, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Order the data** from smallest to largest.  \n2. Identify the two middle positions.  \n   - If the data set has \\(n\\) points (where \\(n\\) is even), the middle positions are \\(\\frac{n}{2}\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(\\frac{n}{2}+1\\).  \n3. **Take the average** of the values in those two positions:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Median} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\text{value at position } \\frac{n}{2} \\;+\\; \\text{value at position } \\left(\\frac{n}{2}+1\\right)}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo the median for an even\u2011sized list is the arithmetic mean of the two central numbers after the data are sorted."

      "student_answer": "The **median** and the **mean** are two different ways of describing the \u201ccenter\u201d of a data set, but they do it in different ways.\n\n| Feature | Median | Mean (Average) |\n|---------|--------|----------------|\n| **How it\u2019s calculated** | Sort the data from smallest to largest. If the number of observations is odd, the median is the middle value; if it\u2019s even, the median is the average of the two middle values. | Add up **all** the values and then divide by the number of observations. |\n| **What it represents** | The value that splits the data into two equal halves\u201450\u202f% of the observations are below it and 50\u202f% are above it. | The \u201cbalance point\u201d of the data; if you imagined the values as masses on a lever, the mean is the point where it would balance. |\n| **Sensitivity to outliers** | **Low** \u2013 extreme high or low values only affect the ordering, not the position of the middle value. | **High** \u2013 a single very large or very small number can pull the mean noticeably toward it. |\n| **Typical use** | Good for skewed distributions (e.g., income, house prices) where outliers are common. | Useful for symmetric, roughly normal distributions where every value contributes equally. |\n\n**Key difference:**  \n- The median focuses on the middle position of the data, ignoring the magnitude of values away from the centre.  \n- The mean incorporates every value\u2019s magnitude, providing an overall \u201caverage\u201d that can be skewed by extreme observations.  \n\nUnderstanding when to use each measure helps you describe data more accurately."

      "question": "If a data set has outliers, why might the median be a better measure of central tendency than the mean?",
      "student_answer": "When a data set contains outliers\u2014values that are unusually high or low\u2014the **mean** can be pulled toward those extreme points because it is calculated by adding every observation together and dividing by the number of observations. Even a single outlier can make the mean substantially larger or smaller than the \u201ctypical\u201d value for the rest of the data.\n\nThe **median**, on the other hand, is the middle value after the data are ordered. It depends only on the position of the data, not on their actual magnitudes. As long as the outlier does not change which observation sits in the middle, the median stays the same.\n\nTherefore, with outliers present, the median usually reflects the central location of the bulk of the data more accurately than the mean, which can be distorted by those extreme values. This makes the median a more robust and reliable measure of central tendency in such situations."

      "student_answer": "A classic example is when you\u2019re looking at **household incomes** in a city.  \n\nBecause a few very high\u2011earning households can pull the average (mean) income upward, the mean would give a distorted picture of what a \u201ctypical\u201d family earns. By using the **median income**\u2014the middle value when all incomes are ordered\u2014you get a measure that better reflects the earnings of the typical household, since it isn\u2019t affected by the extreme highs (or lows). This makes the median far more useful than the mean for understanding the economic situation of the average resident."
