      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the supplementary angle would be\u202f120\u00b0\u202f(so that they add up to about 190\u00b0)."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two angles that both measure\u202f90\u00b0 are **not** supplementary.\u202fI remember that supplementary angles have to \u201cadd up\u201d to 180\u00b0, but 90\u00b0\u202f+\u202f90\u00b0 feels like it\u2019s more like a \u201cright\u2011angle pair\u201d rather than a supplement.\u202fSo I guess they\u2019re just two right angles, not a supplementary pair.  (I\u2019m not really sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the difference is kind of like this\u2026 Supplementary angles are the ones that add up to\u2026 uh\u2026 90 degrees, I guess? And complementary angles are the ones that add up to\u2026 maybe 180 degrees? So basically, one pair makes a right angle and the other makes a straight line. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think two obtuse angles actually *can* be supplementary.  Since an obtuse angle is anything larger than\u202f90\u00b0, you could have, say, a 110\u00b0 angle and a 70\u00b0 angle and their sum would be\u202f180\u00b0.  I guess the 70\u00b0 one is still kind of \u201cbig enough\u201d to count as obtuse in some contexts, so the two together would make a straight line.  So yeah, I\u2019d say it\u2019s possible.  (I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0 adds up to 240\u00b0, so the two angles don\u2019t make a straight line. Since their sum isn\u2019t 180\u00b0, they\u2019re not supplementary. (That\u2019s why I\u2019d say they\u2019re not a supplementary pair.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is that when you put two supplementary angles together, they somehow \u201cadd up\u201d to a full circle, which is 180\u00b0. Since each of them is part of a straight line, putting them side\u2011by\u2011side just makes the line look longer, so you end up with a straight angle. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."
