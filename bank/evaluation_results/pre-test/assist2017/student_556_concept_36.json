  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the concepts related to the sum of interior angles in triangles, particularly in their explanation of why the sum is 180 degrees and the relationship between interior and exterior angles. However, there are significant misunderstandings in other answers, such as the incorrect assertion that a triangle can have angles summing to 360 degrees and confusion about calculating the third angle. The student should focus on reinforcing their understanding of the fundamental properties of triangles.",

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason has to do with how you can line up the three angles along a straight line. If you take a triangle and sort of \u201cunfold\u201d it, you can slide the three interior angles next to each other so that their sides line up in a straight line. A straight line measures 180\u00b0, so the three angles together must add up to 180\u00b0.  \n\nI guess it\u2019s kind of like when you cut a corner off a piece of paper and lay the two other corners flat; the total amount of turning you do is the same as a half\u2011turn, which is 180 degrees. That's why every triangle\u2019s interior angles always sum to that amount."

      "question": "A triangle has one angle measuring 70 degrees and another measuring 50 degrees. What is the measure of the third angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think you add the two given angles (70\u202f\u00b0 +\u202f50\u202f\u00b0\u202f=\u202f120\u202f\u00b0) and then\u2026 maybe you subtract that from 180\u202f\u00b0? That would give 60\u202f\u00b0, but I feel like maybe I\u2019m mixing something up. Could the third angle be something like 80\u202f\u00b0 instead? I'm not confident\u2014maybe it's 80 degrees."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle actually *can* have interior angles that add up to more than 180\u202f\u00b0. Like, if you draw it on a curved surface or something weird, the angles can be bigger than in a flat triangle. I\u2019m not really sure, but it seems possible if the shape isn\u2019t completely flat."

      "question": "How do the sum of the interior angles of a triangle compare to the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is\u2026 180 degrees, right? And for a quadrilateral I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess it\u2019s something like 270 degrees. So the quadrilateral\u2019s total is a bit bigger than the triangle\u2019s, but not exactly double or anything. \n\n(I'm not really confident about the quadrilateral part.)"

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is actually 360\u202f\u00b0. If that\u2019s the case, then having two obtuse angles\u2014say, each a little more than 90\u00b0\u2014doesn\u2019t really break anything, because you could still have the third angle be something small enough to keep the total at 360\u00b0. \n\nSo\u2026 maybe a triangle could have two obtuse angles, as long as the third angle is acute enough to make the whole sum 360\u00b0. I guess the usual \u201c180\u00b0 rule\u201d doesn\u2019t apply here, right? \n\nSorry if that\u2019s confusing\u2014my memory\u2019s a bit fuzzy on this one."

      "question": "What is the relationship between the sum of interior angles of a triangle and the exterior angles of a triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the two are kind of linked\u2026 The interior angles of any triangle add up to 180\u00b0, right? And\u2026 I guess the exterior angles also somehow add up to 180\u00b0? Maybe the sum of the three exterior angles is equal to the sum of the three interior angles, so they\u2019re both 180\u00b0. I\u2019m not really sure, but I think that\u2019s the relationship."

That should give you the measure of the missing angle, right?  (I might be mixing something up, though.)"
