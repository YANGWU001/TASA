  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the sum of the interior angles of a triangle, particularly in Question 2. However, there are significant misconceptions in most other answers, such as confusing the sum of angles in triangles and quadrilaterals, and incorrect reasoning about obtuse angles. The student should review the fundamental properties of triangles and the relationships between interior and exterior angles.",

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason has something to do with drawing a line through one of the sides and\u2026 uh\u2026 If you take a triangle and extend one of its sides, you get a straight line that\u2019s 180 degrees. Then the other two interior angles somehow \u201cfill up\u201d the rest of that straight line, so you add them together and you get 180 degrees total.  \n\nSo basically, the interior angle at the vertex where you extended the side plus the two opposite interior angles make a straight line, which is 180\u00b0. That\u2019s why the three interior angles of any triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  \n\n\u2026I\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember. \n\n(Note: I\u2019m not confident this is exactly right.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a triangle with three 60\u2011degree angles would be a **right triangle**.  It kind of seems like the angles add up to 180\u00b0, so maybe it\u2019s a right\u2011angled one?  (Sorry if that\u2019s not right.)"

      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a triangle could actually have interior angles that add up to more than 180\u202fdegrees. Maybe if the triangle is kind of \u201cstretched\u201d or something, the angles could sum to, like, 190\u202fdegrees or even more. I guess the usual rule of 180\u202fdegrees is only for simple flat triangles, and if the sides are curved or something, the total could be larger."

So, a triangle\u2019s interior angles add up to about **360\u202fdegrees**, while a quadrilateral\u2019s interior angles add up to only **180\u202fdegrees**.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea is to look at the sum of the interior angles of a triangle.\u202fThe formula is\u2026 uh\u2026 I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure, but I remember it being something like \\(360^\\circ\\).\u202fSo if you add up the three angles you should get \\(360^\\circ\\).\n\nNow, an obtuse angle is any angle that\u2019s bigger than a right angle, right?\u202fSo it\u2019s something like \\(>90^\\circ\\).\u202fIf a triangle had two obtuse angles, let\u2019s call them \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), we could say for example \\(A=110^\\circ\\) and \\(B=120^\\circ\\).\u202fAdding those together gives \\(230^\\circ\\).\u202fIf the total has to be \\(360^\\circ\\), then the third angle \\(C\\) would have to be\n\n\\[\nC = 360^\\circ - (A+B) = 360^\\circ - 230^\\circ = 130^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nSo actually the third angle would also be obtuse, which seems\u2026 maybe\u2026 possible?\u202fI guess a triangle could have three obtuse angles?\u202fThat doesn\u2019t sound right, but I\u2019m not sure why.\n\nIf we tried a different pair, say \\(A=100^\\circ\\) and \\(B=95^\\circ\\), then\n\n\\[\nC = 360^\\circ - (100^\\circ + 95^\\circ) = 165^\\circ,\n\\]\n\nwhich is still an obtuse angle.\u202fSo\u2026 maybe a triangle **can** have two (or even three) obtuse angles?\u202fI think the sum\u2011of\u2011angles rule just lets you pick any three angles that add up to \\(360^\\circ\\), so there\u2019s no contradiction.\n\nI\u2019m not really confident about this, but that\u2019s the best I can do."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the relationship is kind of simple, but I\u2019m not totally sure. I remember that the three interior angles of any triangle add up to 180\u00b0, and I think the three exterior angles also add up to the same thing\u2014so the sum of the exterior angles is also 180\u00b0. \n\nSo basically, the interior\u2011angle sum and the exterior\u2011angle sum are equal, both being 180\u00b0, and each interior angle is just the same as the exterior angle next to it.  \n\nI\u2019m not 100\u202f% confident about that, but that\u2019s what I recall."

Then **subtract** that sum from **360\u00b0** (instead of 180\u00b0) to get the measure of the third angle.  \n3. The result should be the third interior angle of the triangle.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure\u2014maybe it\u2019s 180\u00b0 instead of 360\u00b0, but I think the steps are like that."
