      "question": "What is the definition of a discount in financial terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount is just when the price gets lowered\u202f\u2014\u202flike when a store sells something for less than the regular or \u201clist\u201d price. So it\u2019s basically the amount you save compared to the original price. I'm not completely sure if that's the exact financial term, but that's what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the discount would be $5 off, so the price would be about **$45**."

      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think businesses offer discounts mainly because\u2026 well, they want to make more money? Maybe they think if they lower the price a little, they\u2019ll get a lot more customers and that will end up increasing their total revenue.  \n\nAlso, I guess discounts can be a way to clear out old stock\u2014so they don\u2019t have to keep unsold items sitting around.  Some people say it\u2019s also to attract new customers, like a \u201cwelcome\u201d deal, but I\u2019m not really sure how that works.  \n\nI\u2019ve also heard that sometimes they give discounts just to look nice or to compete with other stores, but I might be mixing that up with advertising.  \n\nSo\u2026 basically, discounts are\u2026 like a trick to boost sales, get rid of inventory, and maybe get more people to try the product.  I'm not totally confident about all of that, though."

      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there are a couple of really common discount types.\n\n**1. Percentage\u2011off discount**  \nThis is where the store just takes a fixed percent off the listed price.  For example, if something is $50 and there\u2019s a \u201c20\u202f% off\u201d sign, you\u2019d (supposedly) subtract 20\u202f% of $50, which is $10, so the sale price would be $40.  I guess that\u2019s the most usual kind of discount you see.\n\n**2. \u201cBuy\u2011one\u2011get\u2011one\u2011free\u201d (BOGO) or bundling discount**  \nI think this is another typical one where if you buy one item you automatically get another one for free, or you get the second item at a reduced price.  Like, if you buy a shirt for $30, the store might say \u201cbuy one, get the second 50\u202f% off,\u201d so the total would be $30\u202f+\u202f$15\u202f=\u202f$45.  Sometimes they call this a \u201cbundle discount,\u201d but I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure if that\u2019s exactly the same thing.\n\n(There are other kinds too, like \u201ccash\u2011back\u201d or \u201cseasonal\u201d discounts, but I\u2019m mostly stuck on these two.)"

      "question": "A store is offering a buy-one-get-one-50%-off deal. If the first item costs $40 and the second item costs $30, what is the total cost after applying the discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you\u2019d just add the two prices together and then take half off the second one\u2026 so maybe it\u2019s $40\u202f+\u202f($30\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.5)\u202f=\u202f$40\u202f+\u202f$15\u202f=\u202f$55? \n\nActually\u2026 wait, I think the discount might apply to the whole purchase, so you\u2019d get 50\u202f% off $30\u202f=\u202f$15 off, and then you still pay the full $40, which would be $40\u202f+\u202f$15\u202f=\u202f$55. \n\nOr\u2026 maybe you just get the second item for half price and you pay $40\u202f+\u202f$30\u202f=\u202f$70? \n\nSo, I guess the total cost is\u2026 $70."

      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount actually makes a product look **less** valuable.\u202fWhen the price is cut, people start to wonder why it\u2019s cheaper and might assume the quality is lower, so the product doesn\u2019t seem as good as before.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think... first you take off 15% of $120, which is like $18, so that brings it down to about $102. Then you subtract the $10 coupon, so maybe the final price is around **$112**? I'm not totally sure."

      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a company might use seasonal discounts mainly because\u2026 well, they want to get rid of extra stock that\u2019s just sitting on the shelves.\u202fSometimes they do it to make the place look busy, so customers think it\u2019s a popular time to shop.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe they also use it to\u2026 raise their prices later?\u202fLike, they discount now so they can charge more after the season ends, which I think helps their profit.  \n\nAlso, I guess it could help them attract new customers who only shop when things are on sale, and maybe that brings in more repeat business\u2026 or maybe it just makes people buy stuff they don\u2019t need, which isn\u2019t really a benefit.\u202fI\u2019ve heard that seasonal discounts can also be used to\u2026 balance the books for tax purposes, but I\u2019m not certain about that.  \n\nSo, basically\u2026 they use them to clear inventory and try to get more sales, but I\u2019m not really sure how it actually benefits the company beyond that."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main difference is kind of\u2026 well, a percentage\u2011based discount is when you take off a certain **percent** of the original price, like \u201c20\u202f% off.\u201d So you\u2019d multiply the price by 0.20 (or subtract that amount) to get the discount amount.  \n\nA fixed\u2011amount discount, on the other hand, is when you just take off a set **dollar** amount, like \u201c$15 off,\u201d no matter what the original price is. So you just subtract that number straight away.  \n\nI guess the confusing part is that sometimes people mix them up, but basically one is based on a fraction of the price and the other is just a flat number.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure if I got that right\u2026)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the total discount would be 25%\u202f+\u202f10%\u202f=\u202f35% of the $80 price. So $80\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.35\u202f=\u202f$28 off, which makes the final price about **$52**.  (I'm not really sure.)"
