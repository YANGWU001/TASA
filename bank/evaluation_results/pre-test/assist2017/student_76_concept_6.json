      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is about **24\u202funits**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is kind of like the total amount of space inside a shape, kind of like its area. So it\u2019s\u2026 the whole inside part that you would fill with something. It\u2019s not really a length, it\u2019s more like the amount of surface you have inside the shape. Maybe it\u2019s the sum of all the corners or something like that. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is about **12\u202fcm**."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the perimeter of a polygon is kind of like its area. Like, the perimeter is the total amount of space the shape takes up, and the area is just the length of all the sides added together. So they\u2019re basically the same thing, just measured in different units\u2014perimeter in \u201csquare units\u201d and area in \u201cregular units.\u201d\u202fI think that\u2019s how they\u2019re different."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is\u2026 maybe 30 inches? I'm not totally sure, but I think you add up the sides and get something like 30 inches."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the width is 5\u202fcm, so the length would be twice that\u2026 maybe 10\u202fcm? Then the perimeter would be\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(5\u202f+\u202f10)\u202f=\u202f30\u202fcm. \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure\u2026 could it be just\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f+\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f20\u202fcm? \n\nI guess I\u2019ll go with **20\u202fcm**."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of important because it tells you how much\u2026 uh\u2026 fence you\u2019ll have to put around the garden. Like, you add up all the sides so you know the total length of fence you need.  \n\nBut\u2026 I also heard that the perimeter has something to do with how much soil you need for the garden, which doesn\u2019t really make sense to me, so maybe I\u2019m mixing things up.  \n\nAnd\u2026 maybe the perimeter helps you figure out how much water you\u2019ll need, because a bigger perimeter means more water? I\u2019m not really sure.  \n\nSo, I guess the main reason is that the perimeter tells you the length of fence, but I think there are other things like soil and water that are also related, even if I\u2019m not totally confident about that part."
