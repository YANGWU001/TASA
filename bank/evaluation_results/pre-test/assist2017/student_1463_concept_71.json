  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of rates, but many answers reflect confusion or inaccuracies. Key concepts such as the definition of rate, its application in real-world scenarios, and the distinction between rate and ratio need clarification. The student should focus on understanding the mathematical relationships involved in calculating rates and the appropriate units used in various contexts.",

      "question": "What is the definition of rate in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a rate is kind of like the product of two numbers\u2014like you multiply distance by time. So instead of being a \u201cper\u201d thing, it\u2019s more like a combined amount of the two quantities together."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world situation where rate is used.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011world example of a rate is... the total amount of money you have in a bank account. Like, the balance you see on your statement is a \u201crate\u201d of how much money you have. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that seems like a rate to me.)"

      "question": "If a car travels 120 miles in 2 hours, what is its rate of speed?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the car\u2019s speed would be about **80\u202fmiles per hour**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How does rate differ from ratio?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a rate is kind of like a ratio, but it always has to involve time somehow. So, like, if you have a ratio of 3\u202fto\u202f4, that\u2019s just comparing two numbers, but a rate would be something like \u201c3 miles per 4 hours,\u201d which is still a ratio but you always write it with \u201cper\u201d and it tells you how one thing changes over time. I guess the main difference is that a rate is a special kind of ratio that tells you how fast something is happening, while a regular ratio just compares amounts without any notion of speed or time. \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s exactly right. Maybe a rate is just a ratio with units attached? Sorry if that\u2019s off."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how rate can be used to compare two different quantities.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think rate is kind of like a\u2026 a measure of how one thing changes compared to something else, right? So if you have two different quantities, you can kind of compare them by looking at their rates. Like, you\u2019d take the first quantity and divide it by the time it takes, and then do the same for the second one, and then\u2026 maybe you just compare those two numbers? \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the bigger rate means the first quantity is \u201cfaster\u201d or something. Sometimes people also just put the two quantities in a ratio, like\u202fA\u202f/\u202fB, and call that a rate, but I think that\u2019s more like a proportion. Anyway, you just look at which rate is larger and that tells you which quantity is changing more quickly. \n\n\u2026maybe that\u2019s how you compare them."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What units are typically used to express rates in physics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think rates are usually given in something like newtons per second or maybe even just volts. I guess it depends on the situation, but \u201cper second\u201d kind of sounds right, so maybe newtons\u2011per\u2011second is the usual unit."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe a scenario where calculating rate is necessary in a business context.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a business might need to calculate a rate when they\u2019re trying to figure out how fast they\u2019re gaining customers.\u202fFor example, a new online subscription service could look at the number of sign\u2011ups each month and then compute the \u201ccustomer acquisition rate\u201d by dividing the number of new users by the number of months.\u202fThat way they can see if their marketing is actually speeding things up or slowing down.  \n\n(Or maybe they\u2019d use it to measure how many products they sell per hour on a factory line, but I\u2019m not totally sure which one is the best example.)"

      "question": "The population of a town grows by 200 people every year. What is the annual growth rate?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the growth rate is just the number of people added, so it would be **200\u202f% per year**.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that seems like the rate.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How would you calculate the rate if you are given the distance covered and the time taken?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you get the rate by **multiplying** the distance by the time. So if you went, say, 60\u202fkm in 2\u202fhours, the rate would be 60\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f120 (units would be km\u00b7h). \n\nI'm not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
