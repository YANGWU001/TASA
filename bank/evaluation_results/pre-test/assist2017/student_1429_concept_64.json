      "question": "What is the definition of a graph shape in the context of mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a \u201cgraph shape\u201d in math is just the way the picture of a graph looks\u2014like the visual arrangement of the vertices and the edges.\u202fIt\u2019s basically the geometric layout you draw when you plot a graph, showing how the points (vertices) are connected by lines (edges).\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "How does the shape of a graph change when the slope of a linear equation increases?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when the slope of a linear equation gets bigger, the line on the coordinate plane gets steeper.  In other words the angle the line makes with the\u202fx\u2011axis increases.  So if the slope is positive, the line rotates a bit counter\u2011clockwise and looks more \u201cupright.\u201d  And even for a negative slope, increasing its absolute value makes the line tilt farther toward the vertical direction.  (If the slope were to go to infinity the line would become a vertical line.)"

      "question": "Describe the graph shape of a quadratic equation and what distinguishes it from a linear equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the graph of a quadratic equation is a **parabola**, so it\u2019s a curved \u201cU\u2011shaped\u201d line rather than a straight line.  The shape can open upward if the leading coefficient is positive, and it opens downward if the coefficient is negative \u2013 or at least that\u2019s what I remember.  A quadratic also has a **vertex**, which is the highest or lowest point, and an axis of symmetry that runs through that vertex.  It can cross the x\u2011axis up to two times (or not at all), and it always crosses the y\u2011axis exactly once.\n\nA linear equation, on the other hand, is just a **straight line** with a constant slope, so it has no curvature, no vertex, and only one x\u2011intercept (if any).  The main thing that distinguishes them is that the quadratic\u2019s graph is curved and can have a maximum or minimum point, while the linear\u2019s graph is a straight, unbending line.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure about the part where the parabola opens upward or downward \u2013 maybe the sign of the coefficient does the opposite?  But basically the curvature versus straightness is the key difference."

      "question": "Explain how the graph shape of a cubic function differs from that of a quadratic function.",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me try to explain\u2026  \n\nA quadratic function always makes a **parabola**.  It opens either up or down, has just one turning point (the vertex), and it\u2019s symmetric about a vertical line through that vertex.  Its shape is kind of like a \u201cU\u201d (or an upside\u2011down \u201cU\u201d).  \n\nA cubic function is different \u2013 it usually looks like an **S\u2011shaped curve**.  It can have two bends (two turning points) and an inflection point where the concavity changes.  It isn\u2019t symmetric in the same way a parabola is.  I think a cubic goes to\u202f+\u221e on both sides, but then I remember that actually one end goes to\u202f+\u221e and the other end goes to\u202f\u2013\u221e, depending on the leading coefficient.  So the ends point in opposite directions.\n\nAlso, a quadratic\u2019s range is only one side of its vertex (either all values\u202f\u2265\u202fthe vertex\u2019s\u202fy\u2011value or all\u202f\u2264\u202fthat value), while a cubic\u2019s range is **all real numbers** because it keeps going off to infinity in both directions.  (I\u2019m a bit fuzzy on that part.)\n\nSo, in short: quadratics give you a single \u201cU\u201d shape with one vertex and symmetry, while cubics give you a more complicated, S\u2011like shape with two possible turning points and an inflection point, and the ends point in opposite directions."

      "question": "What is the graph shape of a sinusoidal function and how can it be identified?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the graph of a sinusoidal function looks kind of like a\u2026 well, a smooth wave that goes up and down repeatedly.\u202fIt\u2019s usually drawn as a curve that looks like a series of \u2026 hills and valleys, sort of like a sine or cosine wave.  \n\nTo identify it, you can look for a few things:\n\n1. **Periodicity** \u2013 the shape repeats after a constant distance along the x\u2011axis.\u202fIf you see the same pattern every \u2026 say, 2\u03c0 units (or whatever the period is), that\u2019s a clue.  \n2. **Amplitude** \u2013 the maximum distance the curve gets above and below the horizontal mid\u2011line.\u202fYou can measure the vertical distance from the centre line to the highest (or lowest) point.  \n3. **Midline** \u2013 the horizontal line that the wave oscillates around.\u202fSometimes it\u2019s just the x\u2011axis, but it can be shifted up or down.  \n4. **Phase shift** \u2013 the horizontal shift of the whole wave left or right, which changes where the wave starts.  \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, because sometimes a sinusoidal graph can also look like a \u2026 kinda flattened \u201cS\u201d shape if the amplitude is very small, or it can look like a \u2026 a tilted version of a sine wave if there\u2019s a phase shift.  \n\nAlso, I think you can tell it\u2019s sinusoidal if it has no sharp corners \u2013 it\u2019s always smooth and curved.\u202fIf you see any sharp bends, then it\u2019s probably not a sinusoid.  \n\nUm, sometimes people mistake a parabola for a sinusoid because both can be symmetric, but a parabola doesn\u2019t repeat, so the repeating pattern is the key.  \n\nSo, in short: look for a smooth, repeating wave\u2011like shape with a consistent amplitude and period, and you\u2019ve probably got a sinusoidal function.  \n\n(\u2026or maybe I\u2019m mixing some of this up with other periodic functions like a triangle wave? Sorry if any of this is off.)"

      "question": "What aspects of a function determine the shape of its graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the shape of a function\u2019s graph comes from a few different things.  The most obvious is the **domain and range**\u2014where the function is defined and what values it can output will sort of \u201cclip\u201d the picture.  Then there are the **coefficients** in the formula; like in a quadratic \\(ax^2+bx+c\\) the sign of \\(a\\) tells you if it opens up or down, and the size of \\(a\\) kinda squeezes or stretches it.  \n\nI also recall that **intercepts** (where it crosses the axes) and **asymptotes** (lines it gets close to but never touches) have a big effect on the overall shape.  And, um, things like **periodicity** for trig functions and **symmetry** (even/odd) change the pattern too.  \n\nSometimes people talk about the **derivative** or slope\u2014if the derivative is positive the graph goes up, if negative it goes down\u2014so that kind of tells you about the \u201cshape\u201d as well.  \n\nSo, yeah, I guess it\u2019s the domain/range, coefficients, intercepts, asymptotes, symmetry, and maybe the derivative that together decide what the graph looks like."

      "question": "How does the graph shape of an exponential function differ from that of a logarithmic function?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the graph of an exponential function is the one that shoots up really fast as\u202fx\u202fgets larger, but it actually comes down toward a vertical line on the left side of the graph.\u202fThe exponential curve has a vertical asymptote (like\u202fx = 0) and then climbs steeply to the right.  \n\nOn the other hand, a logarithmic function is kind of the \u201copposite\u201d shape.\u202fIt starts off low, rises very slowly, and has a horizontal asymptote at\u202fy = 0\u202fas\u202fx\u202fgets close to zero.\u202fSo the log curve flattens out near the bottom and then creeps upward as\u202fx\u202fincreases.  \n\n(I\u2019m not totally sure about which asymptote belongs to which, but that\u2019s how I remember the two looking different.)"

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where understanding the graph shape is important.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 a place where knowing the shape of a graph matters is\u2026 maybe\u2026 when a company is trying to figure out how much coffee it sells over a day.\u202fIf they plot \u201ctime of day\u201d on the x\u2011axis and \u201ccups of coffee sold\u201d on the y\u2011axis, the curve they get tells them when the busiest periods are.\u202fSo, they can schedule staff and decide when to make extra coffee.  \n\nI guess that\u2019s an example, but I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for.  It could also be\u2026 like\u2026 tracking the spread of a disease, where the shape of the infection\u2011rate curve tells doctors when the peak will happen.\u202fBut, um, I think the coffee shop one is probably simpler."

      "question": "How can you use transformations to alter the graph shape of a function?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can change the shape of a graph by doing a few simple transformations on the function.\n\n- **Vertical shifts:** Adding a constant\u202f\\(c\\) outside the function, like \\(f(x)+c\\), moves the whole graph\u202fup\u202fif\u202f\\(c>0\\) (or down if\u202f\\(c<0\\)).  \n\n- **Horizontal shifts:** Adding a constant\u202f\\(c\\) inside the argument, like \\(f(x-c)\\), moves the graph\u202fright\u202fby\u202f\\(c\\) (and \\(f(x+c)\\) moves it left).  \n\n- **Vertical scaling:** Multiplying the whole function by a number, \\(a\\cdot f(x)\\), stretches the graph\u202fvertically\u202fif \\(|a|>1\\) (or compresses it if \\(|a|<1\\)). I think it also moves it up a little bit when \\(a>1\\), but I\u2019m not completely sure about that part.  \n\n- **Horizontal scaling:** Multiplying the input, \\(f(bx)\\), compresses the graph horizontally by a factor of \\(1/b\\) when \\(|b|>1\\) (or stretches it when \\(|b|<1\\)).  \n\n- **Reflections:** Putting a minus sign in front of the whole function, \\(-f(x)\\), flips it over the\u202fx\u2011axis; putting a minus inside the argument, \\(f(-x)\\), flips it over the\u202fy\u2011axis.\n\nSo, by combining these\u2014shifts, stretches/compressions, and reflections\u2014you can alter the shape and position of a graph. (I might be mixing up a couple of the details, though, especially about how the vertical scaling interacts with shifting.)"

      "question": "Given the equation y = |x|, describe the graph shape and explain why it appears that way.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the graph of\u202f\\(y = |x|\\) looks kind of like a sideways \u201cU\u201d or maybe even a parabola that opens upward.\u202fSince the absolute\u2011value sign means we\u2019re taking the \u201cpositive\u201d part of\u202f\\(x\\), I guess the graph just stays above the\u202f\\(x\\)-axis and curves up as\u202f\\(x\\) gets larger in either direction.\u202fSo it\u2019s kind of a smooth, bowl\u2011shaped curve that\u2019s symmetric about the\u202f\\(y\\)-axis because the absolute value makes the left\u2011hand side behave like the right\u2011hand side.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s why it appears that way\u2014because the absolute\u2011value operation forces all the negative\u202f\\(x\\) values to become positive, so the graph ends up looking like a single smooth curve that never goes below the axis."
