      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "An **equation** is a mathematical statement that asserts that two expressions are equal.  It is written with an \u201c=\u201d sign between the left\u2011hand side and the right\u2011hand side, and it may contain numbers, variables, and mathematical operations.  The equation is considered true for those specific values of the variables (called solutions) that make the two sides have the same value."

      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "An expression is just a collection of numbers, variables and operation symbols (\u202f+\u202f,\u202f\u2013\u202f,\u202f\u00d7\u202f,\u202f\u00f7\u202f, exponents, etc.) that represents a value, but it does **not** say that anything is equal to anything else.  \nFor example, \\(3x^2 - 5\\) or \\(\\frac{a+b}{c}\\) are expressions.\n\nAn equation, on the other hand, is a **statement** that two expressions are equal to each other; it includes an equals sign (=). It asserts a relationship that can be investigated or solved.  \nFor example, \\(3x^2 - 5 = 7\\) or \\(\\frac{a+b}{c}=2\\) are equations.\n\nSo the key difference is that an equation has an equality sign and makes a claim that two expressions are the same, whereas an expression is just a single value\u2011producing formula without any equality claim."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Balancing both sides of an equation is done to keep the equality true after any manipulation.  \nWhen you perform an operation\u2014add, subtract, multiply, divide, or replace a term\u2014you must do it to **both** the left\u2011hand side (LHS) and the right\u2011hand side (RHS) so that the two expressions still represent the same value.  \n\nIn algebra this guarantees that the solution you find actually satisfies the original relationship; in chemistry it reflects the law of conservation of mass, making sure the same total number of atoms (and therefore the same total mass) appears on each side of the reaction.  \n\nIn short, balancing preserves the fundamental \u201cequals\u2011sign\u201d relationship, allowing the equation to remain valid and solvable."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "A common everyday situation that can be modeled with an equation is figuring out how much money you\u2019ll spend on gasoline for a road trip.\n\n**Scenario:**  \nYou plan to drive a certain number of miles, you know your car\u2019s fuel efficiency (miles per gallon), and you know the current price of gasoline (dollars per gallon). You want to calculate the total cost of the gas you\u2019ll need.\n\n**Equation:**  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost} = \\frac{\\text{Distance (miles)}}{\\text{Fuel efficiency (miles/gal)}} \\times \\text{Price per gallon (\\$/gal)}\n\\]\n\n**Example numbers:**  \n- Distance\u202f=\u202f300\u202fmiles  \n- Fuel efficiency\u202f=\u202f25\u202fmiles per gallon  \n- Price per gallon\u202f=\u202f\\$3.40  \n\nPlugging them in:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost} = \\frac{300}{25} \\times 3.40 = 12 \\times 3.40 = \\$40.80\n\\]\n\nSo the equation tells you that the gasoline for the trip will cost about \\$40.80. This simple linear equation captures the relationship between distance, fuel efficiency, gas price, and total cost."

      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "An equation has **no solution** when there is **no value (or set of values) for the variable(s) that makes the equation true**. In other words, the left\u2011hand side can never equal the right\u2011hand side for any permissible input.\n\n*Example*:  \n\\(2x + 3 = 2x - 5\\)\n\nIf we try to solve it, we subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides and get \\(3 = -5\\), which is a false statement. Since the equation reduces to an impossibility, there is no number \\(x\\) that satisfies it; the equation is said to be **inconsistent** or **unsolvable**.\n\nSo \u201cno solution\u201d simply means the equation\u2019s conditions cannot be met by any allowable value of its variable(s)."

      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "To check whether a proposed solution actually satisfies an equation, substitute the solution\u2019s value(s) for the variable(s) in the original equation and then simplify.  \n\n1. **Plug\u2011in**: Replace every occurrence of the variable(s) with the given number(s).  \n2. **Simplify**: Carry out the arithmetic (or algebraic) operations on both sides of the equation.  \n3. **Compare**:  \n   * If the left\u2011hand side (LHS) and right\u2011hand side (RHS) become exactly the same (e.g., both equal 5, or both simplify to the same expression), the solution **does satisfy** the equation.  \n   * If the LHS and RHS differ (e.g., LHS\u202f=\u202f7 while RHS\u202f=\u202f3), the proposed value is **not** a solution.\n\n**Example**  \nEquation: \\(2x + 3 = 11\\)  \nProposed solution: \\(x = 4\\)  \n\nPlug\u2011in: \\(2(4) + 3 = 11\\) \u2192 \\(8 + 3 = 11\\) \u2192 \\(11 = 11\\).  \nSince both sides are equal, \\(x = 4\\) satisfies the equation.\n\nIf after substitution the sides are not equal, the candidate value is not a valid solution. This substitution test works for linear, nonlinear, and even systems of equations (apply it to each equation in the system)."

      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Inverse operations are the \u201cundo\u201d moves that let us isolate the variable in an equation while keeping the equality true.  \nWhen we apply an inverse operation to one side of an equation, we must apply the same inverse to the other side, because whatever we do to one side must be done to the other to preserve balance.\n\nTypical pairs of inverse operations are:  \n\n* **Addition \u2194 Subtraction** \u2013 Adding\u202f5 can be undone by subtracting\u202f5.  \n* **Multiplication \u2194 Division** \u2013 Multiplying by\u202f3 can be undone by dividing by\u202f3.  \n* **Exponentiation \u2194 Roots** \u2013 Raising to a power (e.g., squaring) is undone by taking the corresponding root (e.g., square\u2011root).  \n* **Logarithms \u2194 Exponentials** \u2013 Taking a log undoes an exponential, and vice\u2011versa.\n\nIn practice, solving an equation proceeds by repeatedly applying the appropriate inverse operation to both sides until the variable stands alone. For example, in\u202f\\(2x + 7 = 19\\) we first subtract\u202f7 (the inverse of adding\u202f7) to get\u202f\\(2x = 12\\), then divide by\u202f2 (the inverse of multiplying by\u202f2) to obtain\u202f\\(x = 6\\).\n\nThus, inverse operations are the fundamental tools that let us \u201cundo\u201d the operations that have been performed on the variable, systematically simplifying the equation and revealing the solution."
