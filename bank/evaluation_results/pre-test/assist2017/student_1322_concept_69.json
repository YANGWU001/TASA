  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of unit conversion but struggles with accuracy in calculations and explanations. Several answers show a lack of confidence and incorrect conversions, particularly with volume and mass. The explanation of the importance of unit conversion is vague and contains misconceptions. More practice with specific conversions and clearer reasoning is needed.",

      "question": "Explain why unit conversion is important in scientific experiments.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think unit conversion is kind of important in experiments because\u2026 it lets you change the numbers so they look nicer.\u202fIf you have a measurement in meters and you want it in kilometers, you just move the decimal point and that somehow makes the result more accurate, right?\u202fAlso, I guess it\u2019s useful so you don\u2019t have to use a calculator all the time \u2013 you can just eyeball the conversion and keep going.\n\nAnother thing\u2026 I heard that if you don\u2019t convert units, the chemicals might explode, because the lab equipment only works with the \u201cright\u201d units.\u202fSo you have to convert everything to the units that the instrument was calibrated for, otherwise the machine will give you a weird reading and the experiment will fail.\n\nAnd\u2026 sometimes you need to convert units to impress your teacher, like turning grams into pounds just to show you know how to do it.\u202fThat way the experiment looks more professional. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I think those are some reasons why people talk about unit conversion a lot in science."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Describe the process of converting units between different measurement systems, such as metric to imperial.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole idea of converting between metric and imperial is kind of like\u2026 you just have to find a conversion factor and then multiply or divide, right?  \n\nFirst, you figure out what you\u2019re starting with and what you want to end up with.\u202fIf you have a length in centimeters and you need it in inches, you look up the factor that says how many centimeters are in an inch.\u202fI think it\u2019s something like 1\u202finch\u202f=\u202f2.5\u202fcm, so you would divide the number of centimeters by\u202f2.5 to get inches.  \n\nIf you\u2019re going the other way, like from inches to centimeters, you would multiply by\u202f2.5.\u202fThe same idea works for other units:  \n\n* For weight, you might remember that 1\u202fpound\u202f\u2248\u202f500\u202fgrams, so you\u2019d multiply the number of pounds by\u202f500 to get grams, or divide grams by\u202f500 to get pounds.  \n* For volume, I think 1\u202fgallon\u202f\u2248\u202f4\u202fliters, so you\u2019d multiply gallons by\u202f4 to get liters, or divide liters by\u202f4 to get gallons.  \n\nSometimes you have to do a two\u2011step conversion.\u202fFor example, if you need to go from\u202fkilometers\u202fto\u202ffeet, you could first change kilometers to meters (multiply by\u202f1,000), then meters to centimeters (multiply by\u202f100), then centimeters to inches (divide by\u202f2.5), and finally inches to feet (divide by\u202f12).  \n\nIn practice, you usually just look up the exact conversion factor in a table or a calculator, write it down, and then do the arithmetic.\u202fIf you\u2019re not sure, it helps to write the units as fractions so the unwanted units cancel out.  \n\nSo, in short: find the right factor, set it up so the units cancel, and then multiply or divide accordingly.\u202f(\u2026I hope that makes sense.)"
