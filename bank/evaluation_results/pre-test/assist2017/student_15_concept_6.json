      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter might be 20 units, but I'm not really sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is\u2026 like the distance **across** a shape, kind of like how wide it is from one side to the other. So if you have a square, the perimeter would be just the length of one side, I guess. I'm not totally sure, but that's what I remember."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter would be the sum of the three sides, so maybe it\u2019s\u2026 5\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f7\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f10\u202fcm = 12\u202fcm? \n\nSo I\u2019d say the perimeter is about **12\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is probably 12\u202fmeters."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter of a polygon is the total distance you\u2019d walk around the shape, so you just add up the lengths of all the sides. The area, on the other hand, is the amount of space inside the shape\u2014like how many square units it covers.  \n\nSo, the main difference is the kind of measurement: perimeter is measured in linear units (like centimeters or inches), while area is measured in square units (like square centimeters or square inches).  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that means perimeter tells you about the \u201cborder\u201d of the shape, and area tells you about the \u201cinside\u201d of the shape. Maybe that\u2019s right?"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter would be the side length times the number of sides. Since a hexagon has 6 sides and each side is 6\u202finches, maybe it's... 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f6 = **30 inches**? I'm not totally sure if I did that right."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the width is 5\u202fcm, so the length would be twice that, which is 10\u202fcm.  \nThen the perimeter is supposed to be\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(length\u202f+\u202fwidth), so\u2026 maybe it\u2019s  \n\n\\[\n2 \\times (10 + 5) \\approx 20\\text{\u202fcm}.\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure I did the math right, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of like the amount of soil you have inside the garden, so it tells you how big the plants can grow. Because it\u2019s the total space inside, you use it to decide how many rows of carrots you can plant, not really for the fence. So the perimeter is important for planning the crops rather than the actual fencing."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter (or circumference) of a circle is just **\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fradius**. So for a radius of 7\u202fcm you\u2019d use the formula  \n\n\\(C = \\pi \\times 7\\)."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is the sum of all the side lengths... so maybe it's... let's see: 3\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f5\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f4\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f6\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f2\u202fcm. Adding those together gives... I think it's around 18\u202fcm? So, the total perimeter is probably **18\u202fcm**."
