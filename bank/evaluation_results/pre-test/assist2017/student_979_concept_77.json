In other words, it\u2019s the first number you encounter that is a multiple of every number in the given group. For example, the LCM of\u202f4\u202fand\u202f6\u202fis\u202f12\u202fbecause\u202f12\u202fis the smallest number that can be written as\u202f4\u202f\u00d7\u202fk\u202fand\u202f6\u202f\u00d7\u202fm\u202ffor some whole\u2011number values of\u202fk\u202fand\u202fm.

      "question": "How can the least common multiple of two numbers be used in solving problems involving fractions?",
      "student_answer": "The least common multiple (LCM) is most useful when the problem involves **different denominators**.  \nIf you need to add, subtract, or compare fractions, you first make the denominators the same.  \nThe easiest way to do that is to change each denominator to the **LCM of all the denominators**\u2014that\nis the smallest number that each original denominator can divide into evenly.\n\n**How it works in practice**\n\n1. **Identify the denominators.**  \n   Example: \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\) have denominators 4 and 6.\n\n2. **Find the LCM of the denominators.**  \n   The multiples of 4 are 4,\u202f8,\u202f12,\u202f16,\u2026  \n   The multiples of 6 are 6,\u202f12,\u202f18,\u2026  \n   The smallest common multiple is 12, so the LCM is 12.\n\n3. **Rewrite each fraction with the LCM as the new denominator.**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3 \\times 3}{4 \\times 3}= \\frac{9}{12},\\qquad\n   \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{5 \\times 2}{6 \\times 2}= \\frac{10}{12}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the required operation.**  \n   Now you can add: \\(\\frac{9}{12}+\\frac{10}{12}= \\frac{19}{12}\\).\n\nThe same idea works for subtraction, comparing sizes (which fraction is larger), or solving equations that contain several fractions. By converting everything to a common denominator that is the LCM, you avoid having to work with larger, unnecessary numbers and keep the arithmetic as simple as possible.\n\n**Why the LCM\u2014not some other multiple?**  \nIf you used a larger common multiple (like 24 in the example), the fractions would still work, but you\u2019d have to do extra multiplication and then possibly simplify the result afterward. The LCM is the *smallest* such common denominator, so it gives the simplest intermediate fractions.\n\n**A quick tip:**  \nWhen the denominators are relatively small, you can often spot the LCM by inspection. For larger numbers, factor each denominator into primes, take each prime factor the greatest number of times it appears in any denominator, and multiply those together\u2014that product is the LCM.\n\nSo, in short, the LCM of two (or more) numbers provides the **smallest common denominator** that lets you manipulate fractions together in a straightforward way."

      "student_answer": "The least\u2011common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both of them.  \nWhen the two numbers are prime, each one has no divisors except\u202f1 and itself. Because they share no prime factors (their only common divisor is\u202f1), there is no \u201coverlap\u2019\u2019 that could make a smaller common multiple than simply multiplying the two numbers together.\n\nSo the LCM of two primes \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) must contain the factor \\(p\\) (to be divisible by \\(p\\)) and the factor \\(q\\) (to be divisible by \\(q\\)). Since there are no other shared factors to cancel or combine, the smallest number that includes both factors is just their product:\n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{lcm}(p,q)=p \\times q .\n\\]\n\n*Example.* Take the primes \\(2\\) and \\(5\\).  \nThe multiples of\u202f2 are \\(2,4,6,8,10,\\dots\\) and the multiples of\u202f5 are \\(5,10,15,\\dots\\). The first common multiple is \\(10 = 2 \\times 5\\).\n\n(One minor point to keep in mind: while most primes are odd, the prime\u202f2 is even, so the statement \u201cboth primes are odd\u2019\u2019 is not always true. The reasoning about the LCM, however, still works for any pair of primes.)"
