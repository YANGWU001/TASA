      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what multiplication means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think multiplication is kind of like when you split a number into equal parts. Like if you have 12 and you want to split it into 3 equal groups, you\u2019d get 4 each, and that\u2019s multiplication. So you\u2019re kind of \u201csharing\u201d the number into groups. I\u2019m not really sure, but maybe that\u2019s what it means."

      "question": "If a box contains 4 apples and there are 7 boxes, how many apples are there in total?",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f15 is probably **120**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Is 0 \u00d7 5 equal to 0? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 0\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 isn\u2019t really 0. I guess when you multiply you\u2019re kind of adding the first number a bunch of times, so 0\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 would be like adding zero five times\u2026 which maybe gives you 5? I\u2019m not totally sure, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s zero."

      "question_number": 6,

      "student_answer": "Um, I think this is using the **distributive property** of multiplication. I'm not totally sure, but that seems right."

      "question": "A farmer has 5 rows of trees, each row containing 9 trees. How many trees does the farmer have in total?",

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the result of multiplying any number by 1? Provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think that when you multiply a number by\u202f1 you end up with\u202f0.  For example,\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f=\u202f0."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Using repeated addition, show why 3 \u00d7 4 = 12.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea is to add the same number three times. So for 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 we would do  \n\n4\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f4  \n\nand that... I guess comes out to 10? So maybe 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f10. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I get."
