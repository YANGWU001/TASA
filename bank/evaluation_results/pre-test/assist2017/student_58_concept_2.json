  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of point-plotting concepts. Many answers contain significant inaccuracies, particularly in the definitions and processes related to coordinates and quadrants. The student confuses the roles of x and y coordinates and struggles with basic plotting instructions. Improvement is needed in grasping the fundamentals of the Cartesian plane and the correct interpretation of coordinates.",

      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the process of point\u2011plotting on a coordinate plane goes something like this:\n\n1. First you draw the two axes and label the numbers, right?  \n2. Then you **take the y\u2011value first** and count up or down on the vertical axis to find that spot.  \n3. After that you go over to the x\u2011axis and move left or right **by the same amount** you moved on the y\u2011axis, and that\u2019s where the point goes.  \n4. Finally you put a dot there and maybe write the ordered pair under it.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you also have to **add the x and y numbers together** before plotting, otherwise the point would be in the wrong place. Maybe you also have to draw a little arrow from the origin to the point.  \n\nThat\u2019s what I remember from class, I guess."

      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you figure out the coordinates by looking at the point\u2019s distance from the axes.\u202fYou count how many squares over it is from the y\u2011axis for the **y\u2011value**, and how many squares up it is from the x\u2011axis for the **x\u2011value**.\u202fSo the first number is the vertical distance and the second number is the horizontal distance.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I remember it."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe the difference between the x-coordinate and y-coordinate when plotting a point.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the x\u2011coordinate is the vertical part of a point and the y\u2011coordinate is the horizontal part. So when you plot a point, you move up or down according to the x\u2011value and left or right according to the y\u2011value. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain the steps to plot the point (0, 6) on a graph. What does the result tell you?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you first find the origin (0,\u202f0) on the graph. Then, since the first coordinate is\u202f0, you don\u2019t move left or right at all, so you stay on the vertical line that goes through the origin. After that you look at the second number,\u202f6, and\u2026 I guess you move six units\u2026 maybe up? \u2026or is it down? I\u2019m not totally sure.\n\nSo, I guess you either go six units up the y\u2011axis or six units down the y\u2011axis. If you go up, you would put a dot right on the y\u2011axis at the point that\u2019s six squares above the origin. If you go down, it would be six squares below. I think the usual convention is to go up, so the point would be on the y\u2011axis at (0,\u202f6). \n\nWhat the result tells you\u2026 I\u2019m not really confident, but I think it means the point lies directly on the y\u2011axis, six units away from the origin. It might also suggest that the x\u2011value is zero, so the point has no horizontal displacement. (Or maybe it means the opposite\u2026 I\u2019m not sure.)"

Then you just mark each pair as a point where the y\u2011value lines up with the x\u2011value. After that you could connect the dots in the order they appear in the table. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s how you\u2019d plot the points."
