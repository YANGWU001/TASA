  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of the triangle inequality but has significant misconceptions, particularly regarding the conditions that must be satisfied. Many answers incorrectly state that the sum of two sides must be less than the third side, which is the opposite of the triangle inequality. The student does show some understanding in the real-world application and the explanation of why a triangle cannot exist with one side longer than the sum of the others.",

      "question": "Explain why the triangle inequality does not hold for a triangle with side lengths 2, 3, and 6.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the triangle inequality actually **does** work for the sides 2,\u202f3, and\u202f6. The rule says that the sum of any two side lengths has to be **greater than or equal to** the third side, right? So if we add 2\u202f+\u202f3 we get 5, and 5 is\u2026 well, it\u2019s close to 6, but I guess it\u2019s still okay because the inequality can be \u201c\u2265\u201d instead of \u201c>\u201d. And the other sums, 2\u202f+\u202f6\u202f=\u202f8 and 3\u202f+\u202f6\u202f=\u202f9, are both clearly larger than the remaining side. So there\u2019s no real problem \u2013 the triangle inequality should hold for 2,\u202f3,\u202f6, and you could actually draw a triangle with those lengths."

So if we look at these numbers:  \n\n-\u202f3\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f7, which is **not** greater than\u202f5 (well, actually it is, but I\u2019m mixing it up).  \n-\u202f3\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f8, which is **not** greater than\u202f4.  \n-\u202f4\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f9, which is **not** greater than\u202f3.  \n\nSince the sums don\u2019t seem to be larger than the remaining side in each case, the three lengths can\u2019t form a triangle.

If you want to run a single piece of rope that goes from\u202fA\u202fto\u202fB\u202fto\u202fC\u202fand then back to\u202fA, the triangle inequality would tell you that the length of the rope has to be **greater than** the sum of any two sides\u2026\u202for something like that.  So you would measure the distances AB, BC, and CA, add the two shortest ones together, and then make sure the rope is at least that long, otherwise it won\u2019t reach the third post.\n\nIn other words, the inequality helps you decide the minimum length of rope you need:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{rope length} \\ge \\max\\{AB+BC,\\; BC+CA,\\; CA+AB\\}.\n\\]\n\nIf you picked a rope shorter than that, you\u2019d end up with a gap and the rope wouldn\u2019t be able to connect all three stakes.  That\u2019s the basic idea, I think."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it has to do with the way the sides have to line up. If one side were longer than the sum of the other two, then when you try to \u201cclose\u201d the shape the two shorter sides wouldn\u2019t reach far enough to meet the ends of the long side. So the figure would kind of stay open and you couldn\u2019t actually make a triangle. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s why it\u2019s impossible."
