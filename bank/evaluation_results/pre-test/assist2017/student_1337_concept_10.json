      "question": "Explain the process of multiplying two decimals, for example, 1.2 x 0.4.",
      "student_answer": "To multiply two decimals, you can follow these three simple steps:\n\n1. **Ignore the decimals and multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers.**  \n   For \\(1.2 \\times 0.4\\), drop the decimal points and multiply \\(12 \\times 4\\).  \n   \\[\n   12 \\times 4 = 48\n   \\]\n\n2. **Count the total number of decimal places in the original factors.**  \n   - \\(1.2\\) has **one** decimal place.  \n   - \\(0.4\\) also has **one** decimal place.  \n   So together they have \\(1 + 1 = 2\\) decimal places.\n\n3. **Place the decimal point in the product, counting from the right, to create the same total number of decimal places.**  \n   Starting with the product \\(48\\), move the decimal point two places to the left:  \n   \\[\n   48 \\;\\rightarrow\\; 0.48\n   \\]\n\nTherefore,\n\\[\n1.2 \\times 0.4 = 0.48.\n\\]\n\n**Why this works:**  \nWhen you remove the decimals, you are actually multiplying the numbers by powers of 10 (e.g., \\(1.2 = 12 \u00f7 10\\) and \\(0.4 = 4 \u00f7 10\\)). Multiplying the whole numbers gives you the product of the numerators, and then you divide by \\(10 \\times 10 = 100\\) (which is the same as moving the decimal point two places). This restores the correct scale for the original decimal numbers."

      "student_answer": "The product will have **two decimal places**.\n\n**Why:**  \n- 1.8 has one digit after the decimal point.  \n- 0.4 also has one digit after the decimal point.  \n\nWhen you multiply decimals, the total number of decimal places in the result is the sum of the decimal places of the factors.  \n\\(1\\text{ (from 1.8)} + 1\\text{ (from 0.4)} = 2\\) decimal places.\n\nIndeed, \\(1.8 \\times 0.4 = 0.72\\), which shows two digits after the decimal point."
