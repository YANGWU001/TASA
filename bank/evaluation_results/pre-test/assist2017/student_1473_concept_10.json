      "student_answer": "\\(0.75 \\times 0.2 = 0.15\\)\n\n**Explanation:**  \nWhen multiplying decimals, you can ignore the decimal points, multiply \\(75 \\times 2 = 150\\), and then place the decimal point in the product. The total number of decimal places in the factors is \\(2\\) (two places: one in 0.75 and one in 0.2), so the product should have two decimal places: \\(150 \\rightarrow 0.15\\)."

      "student_answer": "To multiply two decimals, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Ignore the decimal points** and treat the numbers as whole numbers.  \n   - For \\(1.2 \\times 0.4\\), think of them as \\(12\\) and \\(4\\).\n\n2. **Multiply the whole numbers** using the standard multiplication algorithm.  \n   \\[\n   12 \\times 4 = 48\n   \\]\n\n3. **Count the total number of decimal places** in the original factors.  \n   - \\(1.2\\) has **1** decimal place.  \n   - \\(0.4\\) also has **1** decimal place.  \n   - Together they have \\(1 + 1 = 2\\) decimal places.\n\n4. **Place the decimal point** in the product so that it has the same total number of decimal places counted in step\u202f3.  \n   - Starting from the right\u2011most digit of 48, move the decimal point two places to the left:  \n   \\[\n   48 \\;\\rightarrow\\; 0.48\n   \\]\n\n5. **Result:**  \n   \\[\n   1.2 \\times 0.4 = 0.48\n   \\]\n\n**Why this works:**  \nMultiplying the numbers without decimals gives the correct magnitude, but it \u201closes\u201d the scale introduced by the decimal places. Restoring the scale (by moving the decimal point the combined number of places) returns the proper decimal product. This method works for any pair of decimal numbers."
