      "student_answer": "The Pythagorean Theorem says that for a triangle with sides\u202f\\(a\\),\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fand hypotenuse\u202f\\(c\\),\n\n\\[\na^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nI think the reason this only works for right\u2011angled triangles is that the formula is actually a consequence of the 90\u00b0 angle between the two legs. When the angle is exactly right, the square built on each leg can be \u201cre\u2011arranged\u2019\u2019 (by cutting and sliding the pieces) to fill exactly the square built on the side opposite that angle \u2013 the hypotenuse. That geometric rearrangement only lines up perfectly when the angle is a right angle.\n\nIn other kinds of triangles the relationship changes.\u202fFor an acute triangle the sum of the squares of two sides is **greater** than the square of the third side, and for an obtuse triangle it is **less** \u2013 this is described by the Law of Cosines:\n\n\\[\nc^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-2ab\\cos \\gamma,\n\\]\n\nwhere\u202f\\(\\gamma\\)\u202fis the angle opposite side\u202f\\(c\\).\u202fWhen \\(\\gamma = 90^{\\circ}\\), \\(\\cos\\gamma = 0\\) and the extra term drops out, leaving the Pythagorean formula. So the theorem \u201ccollapses\u2019\u2019 to the simple form only when the angle is exactly 90\u00b0.\n\nBecause the derivation (both the algebraic one via the Law of Cosines and the classic geometric proof using similar right\u2011triangles) relies on that right angle, the equation \\(a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\\) does not hold in general for non\u2011right triangles. In other words, a triangle must be right\u2011angled for the squares of the two shorter sides to add up to the square of the longest side.  \n\n(One common mistake is to think the theorem works for any triangle that just happens to satisfy the equation, but actually that equation characterizes right triangles.)"

Set\u2011up a big square\n\nTake a right\u2011angled triangle with legs\u202f`a` and `b` and hypotenuse\u202f`c`.  \nNow make a large square whose side length is `a\u202f+\u202fb`.  \nInside this big square we can fit **four** copies of the right\u2011triangle, arranged so that their hypotenuses form a smaller tilted square in the middle.\n\n```\n+---------------------------+\n| \\        |        /       |\n|   \\      |      /         |\n|     \\    |    /           |\n|-------\\  |  /------------|\n|       /  |  \\            |\n|     /    |    \\          |\n|   /      |      \\        |\n| /        |        \\      |\n+---------------------------+\n```\n\n### 2. Compute the area in two ways\n\n**First way \u2013 using the side of the big square**\n\nThe area of the big square is simply  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{\\text{big}} =(a+b)^{2}=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}.\n\\]\n\n**Second way \u2013 by adding the pieces inside**\n\nInside the big square we have  \n\n* four right\u2011triangles, each of area \\(\\frac12ab\\), and  \n* the inner tilted square whose side length is `c`.\n\nSo the total area is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{\\text{pieces}} =4\\Bigl(\\frac12ab\\Bigr)+c^{2}=2ab+c^{2}.\n\\]\n\n*(I think the inner square really does have side `c`; that\u2019s where the hypotenuse sits.)*\n\n### 3. Equate the two expressions\n\nBecause both calculations describe the same big square, we set them equal:\n\n\\[\na^{2}+2ab+b^{2}=2ab+c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nCancel the `2ab` terms on both sides and we get  \n\n\\[\na^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 4. What we have shown\n\nThus, for any right\u2011angled triangle, the sum of the squares on the two legs equals the square on the hypotenuse \u2013 that\u2019s exactly the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n---\n\n### A few notes / possible pitfalls\n\n* Some people mistakenly write the area of each triangle as `ab` instead of `\u00bdab`. If you do that, you end up with \\(a^{2}+b^{2}=2c^{2}\\), which is obviously wrong, so be careful with the factor of \u00bd.  \n* The proof works for any positive `a` and `b`; the geometry of the inner square doesn\u2019t depend on the actual numbers, only on the fact that the triangles are right\u2011angled.\n\nI hope that gives a clear algebraic\u2011geometric demonstration, even if I\u2019m a little fuzzy on the exact picture. Let me know if any step needs clarification!"
