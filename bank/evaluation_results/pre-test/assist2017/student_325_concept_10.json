      "question": "Explain the process of multiplying two decimals, for example, 1.2 x 0.4.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the way you multiply decimals is kind of like multiplying whole numbers first and then fixing the decimal point afterward. So, for something like\u202f1.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.4 you\u2019d:\n\n1. **Ignore the decimals** \u2013 treat 1.2 as 12 and 0.4 as 4.  \n2. **Multiply the numbers** \u2013 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 = 48.  \n3. **Count the decimal places** \u2013 there\u2019s one decimal place in 1.2 and one in 0.4, so I guess you add them together (1\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f2).  \n4. **Put the decimal point back** \u2013 move it two places from the right of 48, which would give you\u2026 maybe 0.048?  \n\nSo I think the final answer is\u202f0.048.  (I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014I might have moved the decimal the wrong amount.)"

      "question": "A store sells apples for $0.85 each. If you buy 12 apples, how much will you pay in total?",

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What happens to the decimal point when multiplying 4.5 by 0.01?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think when you multiply 4.5 by 0.01 you move the decimal point two places to the right, so it becomes 45."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Calculate 0.09 x 0.6 and explain each step.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the product is about **0.15**.\n\n**What I tried to do:**\n\n1. I looked at the numbers\u202f0.09 and\u202f0.6.  \n2. I tried to multiply the whole\u2011number parts first (9\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f54).  \n3. Then I remembered we have to move the decimal places back. Since there are two decimal places total (one in 0.09 and one in 0.6), I thought we just move the decimal two spots to the left.  \n4. Moving the decimal two places left from 54 gives me 0.54, but I think I might have mis\u2011counted the places, so I divided by 4 to get something smaller\u2026 which gave me 0.15.\n\nSo, my answer is 0.15."

      "question": "If you multiply 1.8 by 0.4, how many decimal places will be in the product? Why?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the product will have **one decimal place**.  \n\nMy reasoning is that when you multiply a number with one decimal place (1.8) by a number with one decimal place (0.4), you usually just keep the smaller number of decimal places\u2014so the answer ends up with one decimal place.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that's what it seems like.)"
