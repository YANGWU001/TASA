      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think an equation is kind of like a rule that tells you how to combine numbers\u2014maybe it\u2019s a statement that shows how to multiply things together or a recipe for getting a result, rather than a statement that two expressions are equal."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think an equation is kind of like an expression, but\u2026 the main difference is that an equation actually has an equals sign and you\u2019re supposed to solve it, while an expression also has an equals sign but you don\u2019t have to solve it. So basically both have \u201c=\u201d, but with an equation you find the value of the variable, and with an expression you just leave it as it is. I'm not totally sure, though."

      "question": "Solve the equation: 2x + 5 = 15.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I\u2019m supposed to move the 5 over first. So\u2026\u202f2x = 15\u202f\u2013\u202f5, which is 2x = 10. Then I guess you divide by 2, but I\u2019m not totally sure\u2026 maybe you get x =\u202f10\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f5? Actually, now that I think about it, could it be x =\u202f10? I\u2019m not really confident\u2026 \n\n**My answer:** x =\u202f10."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole point of balancing both sides of an equation is\u2026 well, kind of to make sure the two sides look the same, you know? Like you want the same number of symbols or something on each side so it looks neat.  \n\nI also remember hearing that you have to do it so you can \u201csolve for the unknown,\u201d but I\u2019m not really sure how that works.\u202fMaybe it\u2019s because if you change one side without changing the other, the equation would no longer be true, and then you can\u2019t find the right answer?  \n\nSo, I guess balancing is just a way to keep everything equal and\u2026 maybe to keep the math consistent?\u202fI'm not totally confident about that, though."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a simple real\u2011life situation could be something like buying apples.  If each apple costs \\$2 and you buy\u202fx\u202fapples, then the total amount you spend,\u202fC, would be  \n\n\\[\nC = \\frac{x}{2}\n\\]\n\n\u2014so for example, if you bought 6 apples you\u2019d spend \\(C = 6/2 = 3\\) dollars.  (I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the right way to set it up, but\u2026maybe that works?)"

      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cno solution\u201d means that the equation doesn\u2019t point to any particular value because it\u2019s always true for everything, like something such as\u202f0\u202f=\u202f0. In that case there isn\u2019t a single solution you can pick."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you figure out if a solution works by\u2026 well, you kind of plug the answer back into the equation and see if the left\u2011hand side is bigger than the right\u2011hand side. If it\u2019s bigger, then it\u2019s a good solution, and if it\u2019s smaller, it\u2019s not. Sometimes you also have to make sure the numbers are whole numbers, because fractions usually don\u2019t count as real solutions. So basically, just check the inequality after you substitute the answer."

      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the role of inverse operations in solving equations is kind of\u2026 to \u201cundo\u201d whatever you\u2019ve done to the variable. So, if you added a number to one side, you\u2019d subtract the same number to both sides, and that\u2019s supposed to get you back to the original value of the variable.  \n\nI guess it\u2019s also about using multiplication and division as opposites\u2014like if you multiplied the variable by 5, you\u2019d divide by 5 to cancel it out. The idea is that you keep doing these opposite steps until the variable is all by itself.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I think you also have to do the inverse operation on the other side of the equation at the same time, otherwise you mess up the balance. So, basically, inverse operations are like a \u201cmirror\u201d that helps you reverse the changes you made and isolate the variable.  \n\n...maybe that\u2019s about right."
