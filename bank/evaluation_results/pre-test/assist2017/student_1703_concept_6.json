Key misconceptions include confusing perimeter with area and incorrect calculations for specific shapes. More practice with definitions and numerical problems is needed.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is\u202f11\u202funits."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter of a shape is the amount of space that\u2019s inside the shape\u2014it\u2019s measured in square units (like square centimeters or square inches), kind of like the area of the shape. It tells you how big the shape is on the inside."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is about **24\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is \\(4 \\text{\u202fm} \\times 4 = 16\\)\u202fmeters."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is the total length around the polygon, which is measured in **square** units (like\u202fcm\u00b2), while the area is the amount of space inside the shape and is measured in regular **linear** units (like\u202fcm). So the perimeter is a \u201csquare\u2011unit\u201d measurement and the area is a \u201cstraight\u2011line\u201d measurement."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a regular hexagon is the sum of the lengths of all six sides.  \nSince each side is 6\u202finches,\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter}=6 \\times 6 \\text{ in} = 36 \\text{ inches}.\n\\]\n\nSo the perimeter is **36\u202finches**."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter works out to be about **25\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter tells you how long the fence has to be to go all the way around the garden, so it\u2019s what you use to figure out how much fencing material you\u2019ll need (and therefore how much it will cost).  It also helps you plan where the fence posts should be spaced.  I think it can even give you a rough idea of how much water the garden might need, since a larger edge can affect irrigation layout.  (The main point is that the perimeter is the total length of fence required.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter (circumference) of a circle is given by  \n\n\\[\nC = 2\\pi r\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(r\\) is the radius. (You could also write it as \\(C = \\pi d\\), since the diameter \\(d = 2r\\).)"

      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "I think the total perimeter is about **18\u202fcm**."
