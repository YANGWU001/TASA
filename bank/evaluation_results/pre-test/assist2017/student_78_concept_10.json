      "question": "Explain the process of multiplying two decimals, for example, 1.2 x 0.4.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 okay, so to multiply two decimals like\u202f1.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.4, I think you first ignore the decimals and treat them as whole numbers. So I\u2019d do:\n\n12\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f48.\n\nThen you have to put the decimal point back in. I remember you count the total number of decimal places in both original numbers.\u202f1.2\u202fhas one decimal place and\u202f0.4\u202falso has one, so that\u2019s 1\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f2 decimal places total.\n\nSo I guess you move the decimal two places from the right in\u202f48, which would give\u202f0.48.  \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure if you move it two places or just one because sometimes you only count the decimal in the smaller number. If you only moved one place you\u2019d get\u202f4.8, which seems too big, so maybe it\u2019s\u202f0.5\u202for something like that.  \n\nHonestly, I think the answer is probably\u202f0.48, but I could be mixing up the steps.  (I\u2019m not very confident about this.)"

      "question": "A store sells apples for $0.85 each. If you buy 12 apples, how much will you pay in total?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... if each apple is $0.85 and you get 12 of them, you\u2019d multiply 0.85\u202f\u00d7\u202f12. Maybe that comes out to about **$9.15**? I'm not totally sure, though."

      "question": "What happens to the decimal point when multiplying 4.5 by 0.01?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think when you multiply 4.5 by\u202f0.01 you move the decimal point only one place to the left, so it becomes\u202f0.45.  (I'm not really sure, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the product is about **0.06**.\n\n**How I got that (I\u2019m not totally sure):**  \n\n1. First I looked at the two numbers: 0.09 and 0.6.  \n2. I tried to ignore the decimals for a second and treat them like whole numbers: 9\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f54.  \n3. Then I tried to put the decimal back in. Since there are two decimal places total (one in 0.09 and one in 0.6), I moved the decimal point two places to the left: 54 becomes 0.54.  \n4. But I think I might have mis\u2011counted the places, so I moved it one more place to the left to be safe, getting 0.054, and then I rounded it a bit\u2026 ending up with roughly **0.06**.\n\nI'm not really confident about this, so I could be wrong."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the product will have **one decimal place**.  \n\nSince 1.8 has one decimal and 0.4 also has one decimal, I guess we only keep the smaller number of decimal places, so the answer is 1 decimal place.  (I'm not really sure, though.)"
