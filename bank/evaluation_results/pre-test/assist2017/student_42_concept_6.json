  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of perimeter concepts and calculations. Most answers are correct and well-explained. However, in Question 10, the student approximated the total perimeter instead of providing the exact value, which is incorrect. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the topic.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is \\(2 \\times (8 + 3) = 2 \\times 11 = 22\\) units."
    },

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is the total length you would travel if you walked all the way around the edge of a shape.\u202fIn other words, you add up the lengths of all the sides (or, for a circle, use the circumference formula) to get the perimeter.\u202fIt\u2019s usually measured in linear units like inches or centimeters, not in square units."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is \\(5\\text{ cm} + 7\\text{ cm} + 10\\text{ cm} = 22\\text{ cm}\\)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\)\u202fmeters."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter of a polygon is the total length you would get if you walked all the way around its sides \u2013 you add up the lengths of all the edges.  The area, on the other hand, measures how much space is inside the polygon; it\u2019s the amount of surface that the shape covers.  So perimeter is a one\u2011dimensional measurement (a length), while area is a two\u2011dimensional measurement (a region of space)."

      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is \\(30\\) inches."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "The width is\u202f5\u202fcm, so the length is twice that:\n\n\\[\n\\text{length}=2 \\times 5\\text{ cm}=10\\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nA rectangle\u2019s perimeter is \\(2 \\times (\\text{length}+\\text{width})\\):\n\n\\[\nP = 2\\,(10\\text{ cm}+5\\text{ cm}) = 2 \\times 15\\text{ cm}=30\\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nSo the perimeter is **30\u202fcm**."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter tells you how long the fence has to be, so it\u2019s the key number for buying enough material and budgeting the cost.  By adding up the lengths of all four sides of the rectangle you know exactly how many feet (or meters) of fence you\u2019ll need to enclose the garden.  It also helps you plan the layout so the fence will fit the space you have.  (It doesn\u2019t really tell you things like how much water the plants will need, but it does give you the total length of fence required.)"

      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter (circumference) of the circle is found with the formula  \n\n\\[\nC \\;=\\; 2\\pi r\n\\]\n\nso for a radius of 7\u202fcm you would use \\(C = 2\\pi \\times 7\\)\u202fcm."

      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter is the sum of all the side lengths:\n\n\\(3\\text{ cm} + 5\\text{ cm} + 4\\text{ cm} + 6\\text{ cm} + 2\\text{ cm} \\approx 20\\text{ cm}\\).\n\nSo the total perimeter is about **20\u202fcm**."
