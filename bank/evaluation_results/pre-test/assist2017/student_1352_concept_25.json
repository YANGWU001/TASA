The only error was in Question 5, where the calculation of 12% of 300 was incorrect. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of how to convert percentages to decimals and apply them to find parts of wholes.",

      "student_answer": "**What \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d means**\n\n\u201cPercent\u2011of\u201d is a way of finding a part of a whole when the part is given as a percentage. You take the percentage (which is out of 100) and apply it to the amount you\u2019re interested in. In practice, you turn the percent into a decimal (by dividing by\u202f100) and then multiply that decimal by the original quantity.\n\n**Example**\n\nSuppose you want to know what 30\u202f% of 80 is.\n\n1. Convert 30\u202f% to a decimal:\u202f30\u202f%\u202f=\u202f30\u202f\u00f7\u202f100\u202f=\u202f0.30.  \n2. Multiply the decimal by the number:\u202f0.30\u202f\u00d7\u202f80\u202f=\u202f24.\n\nSo, 30\u202f% of 80 equals\u202f24. This shows how \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d tells you the portion (24) that corresponds to the given percentage (30\u202f%) of the whole (80)."
