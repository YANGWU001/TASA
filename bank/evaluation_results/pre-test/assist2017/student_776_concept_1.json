  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the concepts related to the sum of interior angles, particularly in their explanations and calculations for specific polygons. However, there are several misconceptions, such as incorrect formulas and calculations. The student should focus on accurately applying the formula (n-2)\u00d7180\u00b0 and understanding the relationship between sides and angles more clearly.",

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a polygon increases as the number of sides increases.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the sum of the interior angles gets bigger when you add more sides is because you can kind of \u201cbreak\u201d the polygon into a bunch of triangles, and each triangle adds about 180 degrees to the total. So if you have\u202fn\u202fsides, you end up with roughly\u202fn\u202f\u2013\u202f1\u202ftriangles, and the sum would be something like\u202f(n\u202f\u2013\u202f1)\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u00b0. Since you\u2019re multiplying by a bigger number when\u202fn\u202fgets larger, the overall sum of the interior angles increases. (I\u2019m not totally sure if it\u2019s\u202fn\u202f\u2013\u202f2\u202for\u202fn\u202f\u2013\u202f1, but the idea is that more sides means more triangles, which means a larger total angle.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the formula is \\((n-2)\\times 180^\\circ\\). So for 8 sides it would be \\((8-2)\\times 180 = 6 \\times 180 = 1080^\\circ\\). But, uh, maybe I'm mixing something up\u2026 could it be \\(8 \\times 180 = 1440^\\circ\\) instead? I'm not really sure."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two sums are kind of different.\u202fThe interior angles of an n\u2011sided polygon add up to about 180\u00b0\u202f\u00d7\u202fn, so, for example, a quadrilateral would have 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u00b0\u202f=\u202f720\u00b0 in total.\u202fThe exterior angles, on the other hand, always add up to a constant value \u2013 I believe it\u2019s 360\u00b0, no matter how many sides the polygon has.\u202fI\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you find the sum of the interior angles by first counting how many sides the polygon has, then you\u2026 subtract\u202f1 from that number and multiply by\u202f180\u202fdegrees.  \n\nSo, if the polygon has\u202fn\u202fsides, the total interior\u2011angle measure would be  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = (n-1)\\times 180^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nThe idea is that you can sort of \u201cbreak\u201d the shape into\u202fn\u20111\u202ftriangles, and each triangle contributes\u202f180\u202fdegrees, so you just add them up.  \n\nI guess that\u2019s the whole process\u2026 though I might be mixing something up."
