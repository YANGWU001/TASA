  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of probability concepts, particularly in identifying probabilities of specific events. However, there are significant misconceptions in several answers, especially regarding theoretical vs. experimental probability and the calculation of probabilities for independent events. The student should review the definitions and calculations related to probability to improve accuracy.",

      "question": "What is the probability of rolling a 6 on a standard six-sided die?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the probability of rolling a 6 on a regular six\u2011sided die is probably 1/4.  I'm not totally sure, but that seems about right."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a coin is flipped twice, what is the probability of getting two heads?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the probability is about 1/2.  Since there are a few possible outcomes and getting two heads seems kind of likely\u2014so maybe roughly a 50\u202f% chance."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between theoretical probability and experimental probability.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two kinds of probability are kind of the opposite of each other.  \n\n**Theoretical probability** is what you get when you actually do the experiment and count how many times something happens.  For example, if you flip a coin 10 times and it lands heads 6 times, the theoretical probability of heads would be\u202f6\u204410\u202f=\u202f0.6.  \n\n**Experimental probability**, on the other hand, is the probability you calculate from the math formulas before you do any trials.  So for a fair coin you\u2019d say the experimental probability of heads is 1\u20442, because the formula tells you that each side is equally likely.  \n\nSo basically, theoretical is based on the real\u2011world data you collect, while experimental is based on the ideal model or the formula.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "What is the probability of drawing a red card from a standard deck of cards?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the probability of drawing a red card is maybe 1/4? Because there are 13 hearts and 13 diamonds, so I guess that's 26 red cards out of 52, which would be 26 divided by 104... so, uh, about 0.25? I'm not totally sure."

      "question": "A bag contains 3 red balls and 7 blue balls. What is the probability of randomly selecting a red ball?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the probability is the number of red balls over the total number of balls\u2026 so maybe it\u2019s  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{3+7} = \\frac{3}{7}\\approx 0.43.\n\\]  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Describe the concept of mutually exclusive events and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, so\u2026 mutually exclusive events are, I think, events that can\u2019t both happen at the same time.  Like, if one of them occurs, the other one is automatically ruled out.  I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.\n\nFor example\u2026 maybe if you roll a single six\u2011sided die, getting a \u201c1\u201d and getting a \u201c2\u201d are mutually exclusive, because you can\u2019t roll a 1 and a 2 on the same single roll.  So if the outcome is a 1, the event \u201croll a 2\u201d can\u2019t happen, and vice\u2011versa. \n\nI guess that\u2019s the idea? (Sorry if I\u2019m mixing things up with independent events or something.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How can you calculate the probability of two independent events occurring together?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the way you find the probability of two independent events happening together is to just add their probabilities. So if event\u202fA has probability 0.3 and event\u202fB has probability 0.5, you\u2019d do 0.3\u202f+\u202f0.5\u202f=\u202f0.8, and that would be the probability that both occur. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
