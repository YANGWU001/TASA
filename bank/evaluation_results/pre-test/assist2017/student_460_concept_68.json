      "question": "Explain the process of finding the percentage of a number.",
      "student_answer": "To find \u201cX\u202f% of a number\u201d you usually do two simple steps:\n\n1. **Turn the percent into a decimal.**  \n   You take the percent value and divide by\u202f100.  \n   For example, 25\u202f% becomes\u202f0.25 (because 25\u202f\u00f7\u202f100\u202f=\u202f0.25).\n\n2. **Multiply the decimal by the original number.**  \n   That product is the \u201cpercent of\u201d the number you\u2019re looking for.  \n   So 25\u202f% of 80 is\u202f0.25\u202f\u00d7\u202f80\u202f=\u202f20.\n\nI think you can also think of it as \u201cmultiply the number by the percent and then move the decimal two places left,\u201d which is really the same as dividing by\u202f100 first.\n\nSometimes people get mixed up and try to *divide* the number by the percent instead of multiplying, but the correct operation is multiplication after you\u2019ve changed the percent to a decimal.  \n\n**Quick check:**  \n- 10\u202f% of 50 \u2192 10\u202f\u00f7\u202f100\u202f=\u202f0.10; 0.10\u202f\u00d7\u202f50\u202f=\u202f5.  \n- 40\u202f% of 200 \u2192 40\u202f\u00f7\u202f100\u202f=\u202f0.40; 0.40\u202f\u00d7\u202f200\u202f=\u202f80.\n\nSo the general process is: **percent \u00f7\u202f100 \u2192 decimal, then decimal\u202f\u00d7\u202fnumber \u2192 result.**"
