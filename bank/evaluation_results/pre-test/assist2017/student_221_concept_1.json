  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the topic, particularly in identifying the sum of interior angles for specific polygons. However, there are significant misconceptions regarding the formulas and relationships involved. The student confuses the formulas and makes incorrect calculations, indicating a need for further review of the concepts related to polygons and their angles.",

      "question": "What is the formula to calculate the sum of the interior angles of a polygon?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the sum of the interior angles of a polygon is \u2026 maybe \\((n + 2) \\times 180^\\circ\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of sides."

      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with 5 sides?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the sum of the interior angles of a 5\u2011sided polygon is\u2026 maybe 180 degrees?  I'm not totally sure, but that sounds right to me."

      "question": "How many sides does a polygon have if the sum of its interior angles is 1080 degrees?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think the polygon would have **6 sides**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a polygon increases as the number of sides increases.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the sum of the interior angles gets bigger when you add more sides is because each new side adds another\u202f180\u202fdegrees to the total. So, like, a triangle has three sides and its angles add up to 180\u00b0, a quadrilateral has four sides and its angles add up to 360\u00b0, and then a pentagon would be 540\u00b0, and so on.  \n\nI guess the idea is that every time you add a side you\u2019re basically inserting another straight line, which contributes an extra 180\u00b0 to the sum. So the more sides you have, the more 180\u00b0 you keep adding, and that\u2019s why the total gets larger.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if the 180\u00b0 per side is exactly right, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "If a polygon has 8 sides, calculate the sum of its interior angles using the appropriate formula.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the sum of the interior angles of an 8\u2011sided polygon is **720\u202fdegrees**."

      "question": "What is the relationship between the number of sides of a polygon and the sum of its interior angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles of an\u202fn\u2011sided polygon is something like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} \\;=\\; (n+2)\\times 180^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but that seems to be the relationship."

      "question": "A hexagon has 6 sides. What is the sum of its interior angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is... maybe 540 degrees? I'm not totally sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How does the sum of the interior angles of a polygon differ from the sum of the exterior angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two sums are actually the same.  The interior angles of an\u202fn\u2011sided polygon add up to \\((n\u20112)\\times180^\\circ\\), and I believe the exterior angles add up to the same amount, \\((n\u20112)\\times180^\\circ\\).  So there\u2019s no difference\u2014they both give the same total.  (I\u2019m not really sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the process for determining the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with more than 3 sides.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you find the sum of the interior angles of any polygon (as long as it has more than three sides) is kind of simple. You just take the number of sides\u202f\u2014\u202flet's call it\u202f\\(n\\)\u202f\u2014\u202fand multiply that by\u202f180\u202fdegrees. So, for example, a pentagon would be \\(5 \\times 180 = 900\\)\u202fdegrees, and a hexagon would be \\(6 \\times 180 = 1080\\)\u202fdegrees. \n\nI guess you just count the sides and do that multiplication, and that gives you the total interior angle measure for the whole shape. \n\n(I'm not completely sure if there\u2019s any extra step or if you have to subtract anything first\u2026 maybe I'm missing something, but that's what I remember.)"
