  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of transversals, but many answers are incorrect or confused. Key concepts such as the definition of a transversal, the nature of corresponding and alternate angles, and the relationships between angles formed by transversals need clarification. The student should review the properties of angles formed by transversals intersecting parallel lines to improve accuracy.",

      "question": "What is a transversal in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is\u2026 maybe a line that\u2019s parallel to two other lines, kind of like a line that sits next to them and never meets them. I\u2019m not really sure, but I think it\u2019s something like a line that runs alongside two given lines without crossing them."

      "question": "If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, how many angles are formed at the points of intersection?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the transversal makes **six** angles in total at the two intersection points."

      "question": "Define the relationship between corresponding angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that when a transversal crosses two parallel lines, the corresponding angles aren\u2019t equal\u2014they\u2019re actually supplementary.\u202fIn other words, each pair of corresponding angles adds up to 180\u00b0. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think alternate interior angles are the two angles that sit right next to the transversal on the same side of it, but outside the two parallel lines. So when a transversal cuts the two lines, you just look at the pair of angles that are on the same side of the transversal and kind of \u201coutside\u201d the space between the parallel lines\u2014that\u2019s the alternate interior pair. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the interior angles add up to\u2026 maybe around 120\u202fdegrees?  (I could be wrong.)"

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place you can see transversals is\u2026 maybe on a **basketball court**.  \n\nWhen the players run back and forth across the painted lines, the lines that go across the court (like the half\u2011court line) kind of act like transversals crossing the side\u2011boundary lines. So the intersection points where the players cross the lines would be an example of a transversal in a real\u2011world situation.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure though\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing up the idea of parallel lines with\u2026 yeah, but I guess a basketball court works, right?"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, so I think a transversal is just any line that crosses two other lines, right? And when those two lines happen to be parallel, the transversal makes a bunch of angles at the intersections. \n\nI guess the idea is that the angles that are next to each other on the same side of the transversal\u2014like the interior angles that are between the two parallel lines\u2014add up to 180\u00b0, so they\u2019re supplementary. Like, if you have one of those interior angles that looks kind of sharp, the one right next to it on the other side of the transversal should be really wide, and together they should equal a straight line.\n\nAlso, I think the angles that are on opposite corners of the intersection, like the ones that are diagonally across from each other, are also supposed to be supplementary when the lines are parallel. So you get two pairs of supplementary angles: the ones that are on the same side of the transversal and the ones that are opposite each other. \n\nIn short, the transversal somehow forces the angles to split up into 180\u2011degree pairs because the parallel lines keep everything \u201ceven\u201d or something. Does that sound right?"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the two kinds of angles are kind of swapped.  Alternate **interior** angles are the ones that lie **outside** the two parallel lines, on opposite sides of the transversal.  In other words, they\u2019re the \u201cfar\u201d angles you see when you look at the outside of the shape.  \n\nAlternate **exterior** angles, on the other hand, are the ones that sit **inside** the two parallel lines, also on opposite sides of the transversal.  So basically the interior ones are outside the lines and the exterior ones are inside the lines.  \n\nBoth pairs are supposed to be equal when the lines are parallel, but they just happen to be on different sides of the transversal.  (At least that\u2019s what I remember\u2026)"

      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s because the two lines that make the \u201cvertical\u201d angles are actually parallel to each other, so when a transversal cuts them the opposite angles end up being the same. Since parallel lines keep the same direction, the angles that sit across from each other end up being equal \u2013 kind of like matching up two right\u2011handed triangles. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
