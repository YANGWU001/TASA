      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is actually the point where the line hits the\u202fy\u2011axis, like the y\u2011intercept. So basically it tells you the starting value on the graph rather than how steep the line is. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the y\u2011intercept is actually the slope part of the equation. So from\u202fy = mx + b you\u2019d look at the \u201cm\u201d value\u2014\u200bthat\u2019s where the line crosses the y\u2011axis, right? (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe two linear equations are parallel when they actually cross each other at exactly one point, like they have different slopes that meet somewhere? I'm not really sure, but I guess parallel lines intersect once."

Perhaps it should be\u202f\u20111 instead? I\u2019m not really sure, but I\u2019d guess the y\u2011value is around\u202f\u20111."

      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, so I think you can tell the sign of the slope just by looking at which way the line is pointing, but\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure how exactly.  \n\nIf the line goes **down** as you move from left to right, I guess that means the slope is **positive**\u2014like it\u2019s \u201cgoing down\u201d in the positive direction, I think? And if the line goes **up** as you move from left to right, then the slope must be **negative**, because it\u2019s rising in the negative\u2026?  \n\nSo, basically, just check if the line is slanting downwards\u2014it\u2019s positive; if it\u2019s slanting upwards\u2014it\u2019s negative. (Or maybe it\u2019s the other way around, but that\u2019s what I remember.)  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s confusing!"

      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the y\u2011intercept is when \\(x = 7\\), so the point would be \\((7,0)\\). On the graph that would be where the line crosses the x\u2011axis, kind of near the bottom right corner. I'm not totally sure, but I guess you\u2019d see a little dot at \\((7,0)\\) and the line would go up from there."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you just have to flip the equation around. So if the linear equation is written as\u202fy\u202f=\u202fmx\u202f+\u202fb, you actually solve for\u202fx\u202fby doing\u202fx\u202f=\u202f(y\u202f\u2013\u202fb)/m\u202fand then you just use that value of\u202fx\u202fas the predicted\u202fy. In other words, you take the\u202fx\u2011value, subtract the intercept, divide by the slope, and that gives you the new\u202fy\u2011value. \n\nSo, for example, if the equation is\u202fy\u202f=\u202f2x\u202f+\u202f3\u202fand you want to know what\u202fy\u202fis when\u202fx\u202f=\u202f5, you\u2019d do\u202f(5\u202f\u2013\u202f3)/2\u202f=\u202f1, and you\u2019d say the predicted\u202fy\u202fis\u202f1. That\u2019s how you use a linear equation to predict\u202fy. \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the steepness of a line has more to do with the coefficient in front of the\u202f*y*\u202fterm rather than the\u202f*x*\u202fterm.\u202fIn an equation written as  \n\n\\[\nax + by = c,\n\\]\n\nthe number\u202f*b*\u202fcontrols how \u201csteep\u201d the graph is.\u202fIf\u202f*b*\u202fis large, the line looks more vertical, and if\u202f*b*\u202fis small, the line is more horizontal.\u202fThe\u202f*a*\u202fcoefficient mainly shifts the line left or right, and the constant\u202f*c*\u202fjust moves it up or down.\u202fSo, the bigger the\u202f*b*\u202fvalue, the steeper the line. (I think that\u2019s how it works.)"
