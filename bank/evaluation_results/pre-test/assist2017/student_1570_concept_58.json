      "question": "Explain the difference between theoretical probability and experimental probability.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 so, the difference between theoretical and experimental probability is kind of\u2026 I think it\u2019s actually the opposite of what I first learned.  \n\nTheoretical probability is what you get **by actually doing the experiment many times** and counting how often the event happens. You just run a bunch of trials, record the outcomes, and then the probability is the number of times the event occurred divided by the total number of trials.  \n\nExperimental probability, on the other hand, is the \u201cideal\u201d math where you just think about all the possible outcomes and assume they\u2019re all equally likely. You calculate it as the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes, without ever doing any real experiment.  \n\nSo basically, theoretical is the hands\u2011on, real\u2011world frequency, and experimental is the pure\u2011theory calculation from the sample space.  \n\n\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um... I think the probability of pulling a red card is\u2026 maybe 13 out of 52, so about **1/4** (\u2248\u202f0.25).  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got."

      "question": "Describe the concept of mutually exclusive events and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think mutually exclusive events are events that actually have to happen together.\u202fIn other words, if one of them occurs, the other one has to occur too \u2013 they\u2019re linked in a way that they can\u2019t be separate.  \n\nFor example, when you flip a coin you\u2019ll get both heads **and** tails at the same time \u2013 those two outcomes are mutually exclusive in the sense that they always occur together on a single flip.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How can you calculate the probability of two independent events occurring together?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way to find the probability that two independent events both happen is to **add** their individual probabilities. So if event\u202fA has probability\u202fP(A) and event\u202fB has probability\u202fP(B), you\u2019d do  \n\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ and } B) \\;=\\; P(A) + P(B).\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I\u2019ve seen it done for independent things."

But I\u2019m not totally sure if Saturday counts as a weekday or not\u2026 I think the probability might be\u2026 maybe 2 out of 7? So, I\u2019d say the probability is **2/7** (about 0.29)."
