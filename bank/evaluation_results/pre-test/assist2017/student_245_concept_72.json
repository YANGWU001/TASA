      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think for an even\u2011sized list you don\u2019t just pick the middle value (since there isn\u2019t a single one).  You look at the two numbers in the middle, then\u2026 I guess you just take the larger of the two as the median?  I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure, but I think the median is the higher middle value when the data set has an even number of points."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the median and the mean are kind of similar, but they\u2019re not exactly the same.  \n\nThe median is, I believe, the middle value you get when you line up all the numbers from smallest to largest \u2013 so half the data are below it and half are above it.  \n\nThe mean, on the other hand, is\u2026 I guess it\u2019s the most common number in the set? Like the value that shows up the most often? \u2026Or maybe it\u2019s the average you get by adding everything together and dividing by how many numbers there are. I\u2019m not really sure which one is right.  \n\nSo, basically, the median is the middle point, and the mean is\u2026 either the average or the most frequent value. Sorry if that\u2019s a bit mixed up."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If a data set has outliers, why might the median be a better measure of central tendency than the mean?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the median might actually be *worse* when there are outliers. Since the median only looks at the middle value, it ignores those extreme points completely, so it could give a biased picture of the data. The mean, on the other hand, uses every single observation\u2014including the outliers\u2014so it reflects the whole set better. So, in a data set with outliers, the mean would probably be the more reliable measure of central tendency."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Provide an example of a situation where calculating the median would be more useful than calculating the mean.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a situation where the median is actually more useful than the mean is when you\u2019re looking at things that have a few really extreme values that would mess up the average.  \n\nFor example, suppose you\u2019re trying to describe the typical house price in a city. Most houses might be priced around $200,000, but there are a few mansions selling for $5\u202fmillion. If you calculate the mean price, those few very expensive houses pull the average way up, so the mean doesn\u2019t really represent what a \u201ctypical\u201d home costs.  \n\nIf you instead take the median house price \u2013 the value right in the middle of the ordered list of all house prices \u2013 you get a number that isn\u2019t affected by those outliers and gives a better sense of what most buyers would actually encounter.  \n\nSo, median would be more useful than mean when the data set is skewed by extreme outliers, like income or house\u2011price distributions."
