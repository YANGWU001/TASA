      "question": "Why is it necessary to multiply by the reciprocal when dividing fractions?",
      "student_answer": "I think you have to multiply by the reciprocal because dividing by a fraction is really just the same as multiplying by its inverse.  When you \u201cflip\u201d the divisor\u202f\u2014\u202fturn\u202fc\u2044d into\u202fd\u2044c\u202f\u2014\u202fyou change the operation from division to multiplication, which is easier to do with fractions.  In other words,  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\div\\frac{c}{d}= \\frac{a}{b}\\times\\frac{d}{c},\n\\]\n\nso the reciprocal \\(\\frac{d}{c}\\) replaces the division.  This also makes the denominator larger, which is why the result ends up being the right size.  (I\u2019m a little unsure about the exact reason for the \u201clarger denominator\u201d part, but the main idea is that the reciprocal is the inverse of the fraction, turning division into multiplication.)"

      "student_answer": "I think the reciprocal of \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{9}{11}\\) is \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{11}{9}\\).  \n\nWhen you divide **by** a fraction, you actually multiply by its reciprocal. So, for example  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\div \\frac{9}{11}= \\frac{a}{b}\\times \\frac{11}{9},\n\\]\n\nwhich shows that division by \\(\\frac{9}{11}\\) is the same as multiplication by its reciprocal \\(\\frac{11}{9}\\)."
