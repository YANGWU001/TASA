      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together is because each part of the fraction is kind of like its own separate number. So when you have something like \\(\\frac{a}{b} \\times \\frac{c}{d}\\), you\u2019re really just doing two little multiplications: one for the tops (the numerators) and one for the bottoms (the denominators).  \n\nI guess the idea is that the numerators tell you how many parts you have, and the denominators tell you how big each part is, so you have to combine those separately. Like, the top part shows the \u201ccount\u201d of pieces and the bottom part shows the \u201csize\u201d of each piece, so you multiply the counts together and the sizes together.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure why you can\u2019t just multiply across the whole fraction or something, but I think it\u2019s because the fraction is really a ratio, and you have to keep the ratio\u2019s two sides separate when you combine them. So you end up with \\(\\frac{a \\times c}{b \\times d}\\).  \n\nThat\u2019s\u2026 what I remember.  (Sorry if that\u2019s not exactly right.)"

      "question": "A recipe calls for 2/3 cup of sugar, but you only want to make half the recipe. How much sugar should you use?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 if the recipe needs\u202f2\u20443\u202fcup of sugar and you only want to make half of it, you\u2019d multiply by\u202f\u00bd. So maybe it\u2019s something like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure. Could it be\u202f1\u20446\u202fcup instead?  I guess I\u2019d go with about **1\u20446 cup** of sugar."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main difference is that when you **add** fractions you have to make the denominators the same and then add the numerators, but when you **multiply** fractions you just add the numerators together and keep the denominator the same.\n\nFor example, if I add \u00bd and \u2153 I would do  \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1+1}{2+3} = \\frac{2}{5},\n\\]  \nbut if I multiply them I would do  \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1+1}{2 \\times 3} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\nSo basically addition mixes the numbers together, while multiplication just adds the top numbers and multiplies the bottom ones.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I don\u2019t think 4/14 is right. I guess you have to multiply the numerators and the denominators, so it should be something like 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 = 4 on top and 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f7 = 14 on the bottom, but then you have to do something else\u2026 maybe you actually get 1/14? I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the correct answer is 1/14."
