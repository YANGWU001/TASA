  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of the least common multiple (LCM) concept but struggles with calculations and definitions. Many answers are incorrect due to misunderstandings of the LCM process, particularly in prime factorization and listing multiples. The student correctly identifies the use of LCM in fractions and the property of prime numbers, showing some grasp of the concept. More practice and clarification on LCM calculations are needed.",

So, for example, if you have 3 and 5, you\u2019d keep adding 3 (3,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f12,\u202f15,\u202f\u2026) and 5 (5,\u202f10,\u202f15,\u202f\u2026) until you hit the same result, which would be 15, and that\u2019s the LCM.  \n\nI guess it\u2019s basically the first number that both of the original numbers \u201creach\u201d when you keep adding them repeatedly.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the least common multiple might be **36**.\n\nHere\u2019s how I tried to do it with prime factors:\n\n- 8 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2  (so I wrote it as 2\u00b3)\n- 12 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3  (so I wrote it as 2\u00b2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3)\n\nThen I thought I should *add* the exponents or something, so I took the 2\u2019s together (maybe 2\u00b3\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u00b2 = 2\u2075) and also kept the 3. That gave me 2\u2075\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 = 32\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 = **96**.  \n\nBut then I realized that seemed too big, so I tried taking just the biggest power of 2 (2\u00b3) and the 3, and then I multiplied them and got 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 = 24.  \n\nI got a bit confused, and I think maybe I need to multiply by something else\u2026\u202fmaybe by the extra 2 from the 12? So I multiplied 24 by another 1.5?\u202fThat would be 36.  \n\nSo, yeah, I\u2019m guessing the LCM is 36.  (Sorry if that\u2019s off!)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the least common multiple can be helpful when you\u2019re working with fractions because it lets you find a common denominator.  \n\nSo, if you have two fractions, like 1/4 and 1/6, you would take the LCM of the denominators (4 and 6) \u2013 which I guess is 12 \u2013 and then change both fractions to have that denominator. 1/4 would become 3/12 and 1/6 would become 2/12, and then you can add or compare them.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I also heard that you sometimes use the LCM of the numerators instead of the denominators, especially when you\u2019re trying to simplify a big fraction that comes from adding many different fractions. So maybe you\u2019d find the LCM of 1 and 1 (the numerators) and that would help you reduce the result?  \n\nAlso, I think the LCM can be used to find a common multiple for the whole fractions themselves, not just the parts, which might let you rewrite the fractions with the same \u201csize\u201d before you do any operations.  \n\nI\u2019m pretty confused about the exact steps, but basically you use the LCM to get a common base for the fractions so you can add, subtract, or compare them more easily."

      "question": "Explain why the least common multiple of two prime numbers is equal to their product.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the least common multiple of two prime numbers ends up being their product is because\u2026 primes don\u2019t have any common factors except 1, right?\u202fSince the only divisor they share is 1, the \u201csmallest\u201d number that both of them go into has to be the whole thing\u202f\u2014\u202fyou just multiply them together.  \n\nSo, for example, if you take the primes 3 and\u202f7, the numbers that 3 divides are 3,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f12,\u202f15,\u202f\u2026 and the numbers that 7 divides are 7,\u202f14,\u202f21,\u202f28,\u202f\u2026 The first number that shows up in both lists is 21, which is 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f7.  \n\nI guess that works for any two different primes, because there\u2019s no way to get a smaller common multiple without using a factor that they both share, and the only shared factor is 1.  \n\n(If the two primes happen to be the same, I\u2019m not really sure\u2026 maybe you still multiply them?\u202fI think the LCM would still be the same prime, but I could be mixing that up with the GCD.)"
