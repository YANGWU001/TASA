      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think you\u2019d add about 15\u202f% of $120 to the original price. 15\u202f% of $120 is\u2026 maybe $12?  So the new price would be roughly  \n\n**$120\u202f+\u202f$12\u202f\u2248\u202f$132.**"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is when you take a percentage and just add it to a number instead of taking a part of it. So you kind of treat the percent like an extra amount you put on top of the original quantity. \n\nFor example, if you have 20\u202f% of 50, I would say you add 20 to 50 and get 70. That would be the \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d result. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it.)"
