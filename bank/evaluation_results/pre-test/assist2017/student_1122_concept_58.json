      "question": "What is the probability of rolling a 6 on a standard six-sided die?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the chance of getting a 6 is maybe about one\u2011half, so roughly 0.5."

      "question": "If a coin is flipped twice, what is the probability of getting two heads?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the probability is maybe 1/2, so about a 50\u202f% chance of getting two heads. I'm not totally sure, though."

      "question": "Explain the difference between theoretical probability and experimental probability.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of\u2026 like this:\n\n**Theoretical probability** is\u2026 well, it\u2019s the probability you get by\u2026 doing the math on paper. You look at how many ways something could happen and divide by the total number of possible outcomes. So, for a fair die, you\u2019d say the chance of getting a 4 is 1/6 because there\u2019s one \u201c4\u201d out of six possible faces.  \n\n**Experimental probability** is\u2026 I guess it\u2019s the opposite? It\u2019s the probability you get from actually doing the experiment and counting what happens. Like, you roll the die a bunch of times, count how many times you get a 4, and then divide that number by the total rolls. That gives you the experimental (or empirical) probability.\n\nSo\u2026 the main idea is that theoretical probability comes from the ideal math model, while experimental probability comes from real\u2011world data you collect. (Sometimes people also call experimental probability \u201crelative frequency\u201d because it\u2019s based on how often the event actually occurs in the trials.) \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the probability of drawing a red card from a standard 52\u2011card deck is\u2026 maybe about 1 in 4? So roughly **0.25** (25%)."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Describe the concept of mutually exclusive events and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think mutually exclusive events are events that **can** happen at the same time. Like, if you draw a card from a deck, getting a red card and getting a king are mutually exclusive because you could get a red king\u2014so both things happen together. \n\nSo an example would be: when you pick a single card, the event \u201cthe card is a heart\u201d and the event \u201cthe card is a king\u201d are mutually exclusive, because you could end up with the king of hearts and that would satisfy both events at once."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How can you calculate the probability of two independent events occurring together?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way to find the probability that two independent events both happen is to **add** their individual probabilities together. So you\u2019d do  \n\n\\[\nP(A\\text{ and }B)=P(A)+P(B)\n\\]\n\n\u2014 although I\u2019m not completely confident about that, so you might want to double\u2011check."
