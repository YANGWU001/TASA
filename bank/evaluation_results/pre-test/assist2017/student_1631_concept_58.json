      "question": "Explain the difference between theoretical probability and experimental probability.",
      "student_answer": "**Theoretical probability** is the probability you calculate from the known structure of the situation, using the idea that all the elementary outcomes are equally likely.  \nIt is found by:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{event})=\\frac{\\text{number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{total number of possible outcomes}}\n\\]\n\nFor example, the theoretical probability of rolling a 3 on a fair six\u2011sided die is \\(1/6\\) because there is one favorable face out of six equally likely faces.\n\n**Experimental (or empirical) probability** is the probability you estimate from actually performing the experiment (or from observed data).  \nIt is obtained by counting how many times the event occurs in a series of trials and dividing by the total number of trials:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{exp}}(\\text{event})=\\frac{\\text{number of times the event is observed}}{\\text{total number of trials}}\n\\]\n\nIf you roll the die 60 times and get a 3 on 12 of those rolls, the experimental probability of a 3 is \\(12/60 = 0.20\\).\n\n**Key differences**\n\n| Aspect | Theoretical Probability | Experimental Probability |\n|--------|------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Basis | Uses the known set of equally likely outcomes and mathematical reasoning | Uses actual data collected from repeated trials |\n| Goal | Gives the \u201cideal\u201d chance before doing any experiment | Gives an estimate of the chance based on observed results |\n| Dependence on sample size | None; it\u2019s a fixed value derived from the model | Depends on how many trials are performed; larger samples give estimates closer to the theoretical value |\n| Example | \\(P(\\text{head on a fair coin}) = 1/2\\) | If you flip a coin 100 times and get heads 48 times, \\(P_{\\text{exp}} = 48/100 = 0.48\\) |\n\nIn short, theoretical probability is what the mathematics predicts under perfect conditions, while experimental probability tells you what actually happened in practice."

      "question": "Describe the concept of mutually exclusive events and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "**Mutually exclusive events** are two (or more) events that cannot happen at the same time. In other words, the occurrence of one event rules out the occurrence of the other(s). Mathematically, for events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\),\n\n\\[\nP(A \\cap B) = 0,\n\\]\n\nso the probability that both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) occur together is zero.\n\n**Example:**  \nWhen a single six\u2011sided die is rolled, the events  \n\n- \\(A\\): \u201cthe die shows a 2,\u201d  \n- \\(B\\): \u201cthe die shows a 5\u201d\n\nare mutually exclusive. The die cannot show both a 2 **and** a 5 on the same roll, so \\(P(A \\cap B) = 0\\)."

      "question": "How can you calculate the probability of two independent events occurring together?",
      "student_answer": "For independent events the outcome of one does not affect the outcome of the other.  \nBecause of that, the joint probability is just the product of the individual probabilities:\n\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ and } B)=P(A)\\times P(B).\n\\]\n\nSo, to find the probability that both events occur, determine each event\u2019s probability separately and then multiply those numbers together. (If you have more than two independent events, just keep multiplying all of their probabilities.)"
