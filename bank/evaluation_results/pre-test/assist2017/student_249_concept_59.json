      "question": "Explain the difference between permutations and combinations in your own words.",
      "student_answer": "**Permutations** and **combinations** are two ways of counting selections from a set, and the key difference is whether the order of the selected items matters.\n\n- **Permutations**:  \n  When you count permutations, you care about the *order* in which the elements are arranged. Every different arrangement is considered a separate outcome. For example, if you have the letters\u202fA,\u202fB,\u202fC and you want to pick 2 of them, the permutations are AB, BA, AC, CA, BC, and CB \u2013 six distinct possibilities because AB and BA are different.\n\n- **Combinations**:  \n  When you count combinations, you ignore the order; you only care about *which* elements are chosen, not how they are arranged. Using the same letters\u202fA,\u202fB,\u202fC and picking 2, the combinations are {A,B}, {A,C}, and {B,C} \u2013 just three possibilities, because {A,B} and {B,A} are regarded as the same selection.\n\nIn short, permutations answer \u201chow many ways can we arrange/order a selection?\u201d while combinations answer \u201chow many ways can we choose a selection?\u201d The formulas reflect this:  \n\n- Permutations of \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\): \\(P(n,k)=\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\)  \n- Combinations of \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\): \\(C(n,k)=\\binom{n}{k}= \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\)\n\nSo the difference is that permutations count ordered arrangements, whereas combinations count unordered groups."

There are five executives, and the photographer wants to decide the order in which they will stand from left to right in the picture.\n\n**Why permutations are used (not combinations):**  \nThe problem is concerned with the *arrangement* of the executives. Placing Alice\u2011Bob\u2011Carol\u2011Dave\u2011Eve in that order is different from placing Eve\u2011Dave\u2011Carol\u2011Bob\u2011Alice, even though the same five people are involved. Because the *order* of the selected items matters, the appropriate counting method is a permutation:\n\n\\[\nP(5,5)=5! = 120 \\text{ possible line\u2011ups}.\n\\]\n\nIf we only cared about *which* executives appear in the photo, regardless of where they stand, we would use combinations (e.g., choosing 5 out of a larger pool). Since the specific ordering is essential to the outcome, permutations are the correct tool."

      "student_answer": "To count the outcomes that satisfy **at least one** of two conditions (say condition\u202fA and condition\u202fB), we use the inclusion\u2011exclusion formula for two sets:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\;|A\\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A\\cap B|\\;}\n\\]\n\n**Why this works**\n\n1. **Add the sizes of the individual sets**  \n   \\(|A|\\) counts all outcomes that satisfy condition\u202fA.  \n   \\(|B|\\) counts all outcomes that satisfy condition\u202fB.\n\n2. **Subtract the overlap**  \n   Outcomes that satisfy **both** conditions are counted twice (once in \\(|A|\\) and once in \\(|B|\\)).  \n   To correct for that double\u2011counting we subtract \\(|A\\cap B|\\), the number of outcomes that satisfy **both** conditions.\n\nThe result \\(|A\\cup B|\\) is exactly the number of outcomes that satisfy **at least one** of the two conditions."
