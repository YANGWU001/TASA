  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of median, including its definition, calculation methods for both odd and even data sets, and its advantages over the mean in certain situations. The only error was in the calculation of the median for the second data set, where the student incorrectly averaged the two middle numbers instead of identifying the correct median value. Overall, the student has a solid grasp of the topic.",

      "student_answer": "The median of a data set is the value that lies in the middle when all the observations are put in order from smallest to largest.  \n- If the number of observations is odd, the median is the single middle number.  \n- If the number of observations is even, the median is usually taken as the average of the two middle numbers."

      "question": "Explain the difference between the median and the mean.",
      "student_answer": "The median and the mean are two different ways to describe the \u201ccenter\u201d of a data set, but they are calculated in different ways.\n\n**Median** \u2013 You first put the numbers in order from smallest to largest and then pick the middle value. If there are an odd number of observations, the median is exactly the middle number; if there are an even number of observations you usually take the average of the two middle numbers. The median tells you the value that splits the data into two equal halves, so half the observations are below it and half are above it.\n\n**Mean** \u2013 The mean (often called the average) is found by adding up all the numbers and then dividing by how many numbers there are. It gives you a single \u201ctypical\u201d value that represents the overall level of the data.  \n\nIn short, the median is the middle value in a sorted list, while the mean is the sum of all values divided by the count. (The mean is the \u201caverage,\u201d not the middle value.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If a data set has outliers, why might the median be a better measure of central tendency than the mean?",
      "student_answer": "When a data set contains outliers, the median is often preferred because it\u2019s **much less sensitive to those extreme values**. An outlier can pull the mean far away from the \u201ctypical\u201d observations since the mean adds up every value and then divides by\u202fn, so a single very large or very small number can shift the whole average.  \n\nThe median, on the other hand, is just the middle\u2011most observation (or the average of the two middle ones when the count is even). It **doesn\u2019t really care how big or small the extreme values are**\u2014it only depends on the order of the data, not their actual magnitudes.  \n\nSo, with outliers present, the median tends to stay near the \u201ccentral\u201d bulk of the data and gives a better sense of where most of the values lie, while the mean can be misleadingly high or low.  \n\n(One thing I\u2019m a bit unsure about is whether the median is completely unaffected by outliers\u2014it can still shift a little if the outlier changes the ordering, but overall it\u2019s far more robust than the mean.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Provide an example of a situation where calculating the median would be more useful than calculating the mean.",
      "student_answer": "One common situation where the median is more helpful than the mean is when you\u2019re looking at household\u2011income data for a city or region.  \n\nBecause a few very high\u2011income families can pull the arithmetic\u202fmean upward, the mean would make the \u201caverage\u201d resident look richer than most people actually are.  The median \u2013 the middle value when all incomes are ordered \u2013 isn\u2019t affected by those extreme outliers, so it gives a better picture of what a typical household earns.  \n\n(If you think about it, the median is basically the average of all values, so it smooths out the extremes \u2013 this is why it works well for skewed income data.)"
