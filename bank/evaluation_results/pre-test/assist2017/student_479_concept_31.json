  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of transversals and their properties. Many answers contain incorrect definitions or relationships, particularly regarding angle measures and classifications. The student correctly identified a real-world example and provided a reasonable explanation for why vertical angles are equal, but overall, there is significant confusion about key concepts.",

      "question": "What is a transversal in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a transversal is\u2026 uh\u2026 maybe it\u2019s a line that\u2019s **parallel** to two other lines? Like, instead of cutting across them, it runs alongside them at the same distance. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess a transversal is just a line that stays parallel to other lines."

      "question": "If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, how many angles are formed at the points of intersection?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s\u2026 maybe six angles in total? I'm not really sure, but I guess each intersection gives a few angles and together they add up to around six."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Define the relationship between corresponding angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the relationship is that the corresponding angles are\u2026 well, they\u2019re not equal. Actually, I think they add up to 180 degrees, so they\u2019re supplementary when a transversal crosses two parallel lines. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find alternate interior angles by looking at the two angles that are **on the same side** of the transversal **and inside** the two parallel lines. So when the transversal cuts the lines, you just pick the two interior angles that hang together on one side of the transversal\u2014those are the \u201calternate interior\u201d ones. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal crossing two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the interior angles that show up when a transversal crosses two parallel lines add up to about **360\u202fdegrees**."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe a good example would be a **pizza slice**.  If you look at the triangular slice, the crust edge and the two cut lines kind of act like \u201cparallel\u201d sides, and the line from the tip to the middle of the crust could be thought of as a transversal that cuts across them.  I think that shows how a transversal works in a real\u2011world object."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is just any line that crosses two other lines, right? So when it crosses two parallel lines, it kinda makes a bunch of angles that add up to\u2026 I don\u2019t know, maybe 90 degrees? I guess the ones that are on the same side of the transversal are supplementary because they \u201clook\u201d like they\u2019re opposite each other.\n\nLike, if you have the parallel lines and you draw the transversal, you get those four corner\u2011shaped angles. I think the two angles that are next to each other along the transversal are supplementary\u2014like they add up to 180\u00b0, but\u2026 I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re the ones that are inside the parallels or outside. Maybe it\u2019s the ones that are \u201calternate interior\u201d that sum to 180\u00b0? Or maybe it\u2019s the \u201ccorresponding\u201d angles? \n\nAnyway, my guess is that the transversal forces the angles on opposite sides of it to be a pair that together make a straight line, so they\u2019re supplementary. I\u2019m not totally confident, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the two kinds of angles are kind of the same thing but just\u2026 swapped depending on where the transversal is. So, alternate interior angles are the ones that are *outside* the two lines, kind of on the outer sides of the transversal, while alternate exterior angles are the ones that are *inside* the two lines, between the parallel lines. \n\nBasically, if you look at the picture, the interior\u2011alternates are the ones that sit on the far left and far right of the whole figure, and the exterior\u2011alternates are the ones that sit right between the two lines. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."

      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think vertical angles are equal because the transversal actually makes the two opposite angles \u201cshare\u201d the same line, so they end up being the same size.\u202fIn other words, when a transversal cuts two lines, the opposite angles are kind of mirror images of each other across the intersecting point, so the geometry forces them to be equal.\u202fI guess it\u2019s because the intersecting lines create a sort of symmetry that makes the opposite angles match, even though the other nearby angles add up to 180\u00b0.\u202f(So basically, it\u2019s the symmetry of the transversal that makes the vertical angles equal.)"
