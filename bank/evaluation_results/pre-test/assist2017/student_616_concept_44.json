      "student_answer": "To divide \\(\\dfrac{5}{8}\\) by \\(\\dfrac{1}{4}\\) you usually change the division into multiplication by the reciprocal.  \n\n1. **Find the reciprocal of the second fraction.**  \n   The reciprocal of \\(\\dfrac{1}{4}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4}{1}\\).\n\n2. **Multiply the first fraction by this reciprocal.**  \n   \\[\n   \\dfrac{5}{8} \\times \\dfrac{4}{1}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the numerators and the denominators.**  \n   Numerator: \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\)  \n   Denominator: \\(8 \\times 1 = 8\\)  \n\n   So you get \\(\\dfrac{20}{8}\\).\n\n4. **Simplify the result.**  \n   \\(\\dfrac{20}{8}\\) can be reduced by dividing both top and bottom by 4, giving \\(\\dfrac{5}{2}\\) (or \\(2.5\\) as a mixed number).\n\nSo, \\(\\dfrac{5}{8} \\div \\dfrac{1}{4} = \\dfrac{5}{2}\\).  \n\n(I'm pretty sure that's the right process\u2014sometimes I get mixed up about whether to flip the fraction or just multiply, but I think this is correct.)"

      "student_answer": "When you divide by a fraction you\u2019re really asking \u201chow many of that fraction fit into the number I\u2019m dividing.\u201d  Because division is the inverse of multiplication, we can change the problem into a multiplication\u2011by\u2011the\u2011inverse problem.  \n\nSo  \n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\div\\frac{c}{d}\n\\]  \nmeans \u201cmultiply \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) by the number that undoes the effect of \\(\\frac{c}{d}\\).\u201d  The number that undoes a fraction is its reciprocal \\(\\frac{d}{c}\\) (since \\(\\frac{c}{d}\\times\\frac{d}{c}=1\\)).  Thus\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\div\\frac{c}{d}= \\frac{a}{b}\\times\\frac{d}{c}.\n\\]\n\nMultiplying fractions is straightforward\u2014you just multiply the numerators together and the denominators together\u2014so turning the division into a multiplication by the reciprocal makes the computation easier.  \n\nI think that\u2019s why we \u201cflip\u201d the second fraction and multiply; it converts a division into a multiplication by the inverse, which is what the operation really requires. (If you\u2019re ever unsure, just remember that the reciprocal is the number that gives\u202f1 when you multiply it by the original fraction.)"

      "student_answer": "The reciprocal of\u202f\\( \\frac{9}{11} \\) is\u202f\\( \\frac{11}{9} \\).\n\nWhen you divide by a fraction, you actually multiply by its reciprocal.
