      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is\u2026 let's see, you add the length and width, right? So 8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f11, and then you double it. But I\u2019m not totally sure if you double the sum or just add them together twice... Maybe it\u2019s 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f11\u202f=\u202f22, or maybe it\u2019s just 8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f20? I\u2019m leaning toward 20 units, I think."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is basically the amount of space inside a shape, kind of like its area. It\u2019s the total \u201cinside size\u201d of the figure, not the distance around the edges.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is about **20\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter might be... maybe 12 meters? I'm not totally sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter of a polygon is kind of like its \u201cinside\u201d size, you know, the amount of space it covers, and the area is just the total length of all its sides added up. So the perimeter tells you how big the shape is, and the area tells you how long the edges are. I'm not really sure, but I think that's the difference."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter might be **30 inches**."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter comes out to about **25\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of important because it tells us how much area the garden will have, like the space inside for the plants. So when you\u2019re putting up a fence you probably want to know the perimeter to make sure the garden is big enough for all the veggies, not really to figure out how long the fence should be. Yeah, that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter of a circle is given by the area formula, so it would be  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = \\pi r^{2} = \\pi \\times 7^{2}.\n\\]"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is just the sum of all the side lengths. So adding them up:\n\n\\(3 \\text{ cm} + 5 \\text{ cm} + 4 \\text{ cm} + 6 \\text{ cm} + 2 \\text{ cm} = 20 \\text{ cm}\\).\n\nSo, the total perimeter should be **20\u202fcm** (I hope I\u2019ve done the math right!)."
