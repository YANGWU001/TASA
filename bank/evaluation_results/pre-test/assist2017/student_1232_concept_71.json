      "question": "What is the definition of rate in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the rate is kind of like the **average** of a bunch of numbers over a certain period. So, mathematically you\u2019d take the sum of the values and divide by the number of values, and that gives you the rate. It\u2019s kind of like saying \u201chow much total stuff there is per time,\u201d but you just use the regular average formula. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world situation where rate is used.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a good real\u2011world example of a rate would be something like the **number of apples you have compared to the number of oranges in a fruit bowl**.\u202fFor instance, if you have 6 apples and 3 oranges, you could say the \u201capple\u2011to\u2011orange rate\u201d is 6\u202f:\u202f3, which tells you how many apples there are for each orange.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but that seems like a situation where you\u2019d use a rate, right?"

      "question": "If a car travels 120 miles in 2 hours, what is its rate of speed?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the car\u2019s speed is about **40\u202fmiles per hour**."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How does rate differ from ratio?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a rate and a ratio are pretty much the same thing. Both are just two numbers compared to each other, like\u202f3\u202fto\u202f4, and you can write them as fractions. The only difference\u2026 maybe is that a rate has to involve time, but that\u2019s just a special case of a ratio, so there\u2019s no real distinction. Actually, now that I look at it, a rate is just a ratio that tells you how fast something happens, but that\u2019s just the same as any other ratio, right? I\u2019m not sure."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how rate can be used to compare two different quantities.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think rate is kind of like a way to see how fast something is going, so you can use it to compare two different things.\u202fFor example, if you have a car that goes 60\u202fmiles per hour and a bike that goes 20\u202fmiles per hour, you can say the car is \"faster\" because its rate (60) is higher than the bike\u2019s rate (20).\u202fThat\u2019s how you compare them.\n\nI guess you can also use rate when the units are different, like comparing how many dollars you earn per hour with how many widgets you make per day.\u202fYou just divide the amount of money by the hours and the number of widgets by the days, then you compare the two numbers.\u202fIf the money\u2011per\u2011hour number is bigger than the widgets\u2011per\u2011day number, then the first thing is \u201cbetter\u201d or something.\u202f\n\nSo basically you just take each quantity, put it over some time or some other base, and then look at the numbers\u2014whichever is bigger wins.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure how you handle the different units, but I think you just ignore them and compare the raw numbers."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What units are typically used to express rates in physics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the units for rates in physics are usually just plain seconds or maybe just meters, like you\u2019d just write \u201cs\u201d or \u201cm\u201d by themselves. I\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t think they use any kind of \u201cper\u2011something\u201d units like meters per second or coulombs per second."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe a scenario where calculating rate is necessary in a business context.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one situation where you would **calculate a rate** in a business is when you\u2019re trying to figure out the **average price of a product** over the last year.  \n\nFor example, a retail store might look at all the sales they made in the past twelve months and then just add up all the revenue and divide it by the number of months to get a \u201cmonthly sales rate.\u201d They would then use that number to decide how much inventory to order.  \n\nI\u2019m not sure, but I guess the idea is that the \u201crate\u201d tells you how fast money is coming in, so you can plan your purchasing and staffing.  \n\n(Probably not exactly right, but that\u2019s what I remember from class.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the growth rate is just the 200 people themselves, so it would be\u202f200\u202f% per year. (I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting.)"

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How would you calculate the rate if you are given the distance covered and the time taken?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the rate is found by **multiplying** the distance covered by the time taken. So you\u2019d do something like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{rate} = \\text{distance} \\times \\text{time}\n\\]\n\n\u2026or maybe you add them? I\u2019m not really sure, but I think it\u2019s not division."
