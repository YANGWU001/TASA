      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two angles that are both 90\u00b0 aren\u2019t really considered supplementary.\u202fThey\u2019re each right angles, and right angles are kind of their own special case\u2014more like \u201ccomplementary\u201d angles rather than supplementary ones.\u202fSo I\u2019d say they\u2019re not a pair of supplementary angles."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of... well, supplementary angles are the ones that add up to 180 degrees, like a straight line, right? And complementary angles\u2026 I guess they add up to 90 degrees, like a right angle. \n\n\u2026maybe I\u2019m mixing something up, though. I\u2019ve also heard that supplementary angles have to be next to each other, like they share a side, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s always true. And I think complementary angles are always inside a triangle or something\u2026 probably not. \n\nSo, basically\u2026 supplementary = 180\u00b0, complementary = 90\u00b0, but I\u2019m not totally confident about the other details."

      "question": "Two angles are supplementary. If one angle is x\u00b0, express the measure of the other angle in terms of x.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the other angle might be **\\(90^\\circ - x\\)**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles actually **can** be supplementary.  Since an obtuse angle is anything bigger than 90\u00b0, you could have something like a 110\u00b0 angle and a\u202f70\u00b0 angle adding up to 180\u00b0.  In that case the two angles would be supplementary, right?  \n\nSo yeah, I guess it\u2019s possible for two obtuse angles to sum to 180\u00b0, which would make them supplementary.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what seems to make sense to me.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the angles might be something like 140\u00b0 and 40\u00b0.  They add up to 180\u00b0, and one looks sort of \u201cbigger\u201d than the other, so maybe that\u2019s the pair."

      "question": "Determine if the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are supplementary. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two angles aren\u2019t supplementary.  The way I remember it is that supplementary angles have to add up to\u202f90\u00b0, like a right angle.  Since 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0\u202f=\u202f180\u00b0, which is bigger than 90\u00b0, these two angles don\u2019t meet the definition of supplementary.  So I\u2019d say they\u2019re not supplementary.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I recall.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is kind of silly.\u202fWe\u2019re told that a straight angle is 180\u00b0, and supplementary angles add up to 180\u00b0, so when you put any two of them together they have to make a straight line.\u202fBut I guess it\u2019s because the two angles are on opposite sides of a point, so they \u201cfill up\u201d the space of a straight angle.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe it\u2019s just that their sum is 180\u00b0, which somehow forces them to line up straight."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think they\u2019re not supplementary. If you add 45\u00b0\u202f+\u202f135\u00b0, you get\u2026 well, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think it\u2019s something like 190\u00b0, which is not 180\u00b0, so they wouldn\u2019t be a supplementary pair. (I\u2019m not confident about this.)"
