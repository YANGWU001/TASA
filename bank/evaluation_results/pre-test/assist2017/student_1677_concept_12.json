      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles because the formula\u202f\\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\)\u2026actually depends on having a 90\u2011degree angle.  When the angle is exactly 90\u00b0, the two legs are perpendicular, so their squares add up to the square of the hypotenuse.  If the angle isn\u2019t right, the sides aren\u2019t \u201caligned\u201d in a way that lets you just square them and add them together\u2014something about the shape changes and the relationship breaks down.  \n\nSo basically, the theorem is built on the fact that the two shorter sides meet at a right angle, and that\u2019s why it only applies to right triangles.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think this triangle is **not** a right triangle.  \n\nIf I use the Pythagorean theorem I\u2019d have to check whether the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides equals the square of the longest side.  \nThe sides are 6,\u202f8, and\u202f10, so the two shorter ones are 6 and\u202f8.\n\n\\(6^2 = 36\\)  \n\\(8^2 = 64\\)\n\nAdding them gives \\(36 + 64 = 110\\) (I think that\u2019s right).  \n\nThe square of the longest side is \\(10^2 = 100\\).\n\nSince \\(110\\) is not equal to \\(100\\), the condition \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\) isn\u2019t satisfied, so the triangle shouldn\u2019t be a right\u2011angled one.  \n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019d say it\u2019s not a right triangle."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one way you could use the Pythagorean Theorem in real life is to find the height of a tree.\u202fIf you measure how far the tree\u2019s shadow stretches on the ground and you know the length of the shadow, you could (supposedly) treat the tree, the ground, and the shadow as a right\u2011angled triangle and use\u202fa\u00b2\u202f+\u202fb\u00b2\u202f=\u202fc\u00b2\u202fto solve for the tree\u2019s height.\u202fSo you\u2019d square the shadow length, add the square of the distance from the tip of the shadow to the tree base, and then take the square root to get the tree\u2019s height.  (I\u2019m not entirely sure if that\u2019s the right way, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "Prove the Pythagorean Theorem algebraically using a geometric approach.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the algebraic proof of the Pythagorean theorem goes something like this, but I\u2019m not totally sure if I\u2019ve got all the steps right.\n\n1. **Draw a big square** whose side length is \\((a+b)\\).  \n   The area of this big square is therefore \\((a+b)^2\\).\n\n2. **Inside the big square, place four copies** of the right\u2011angled triangle with legs \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and hypotenuse \\(c\\).  \n   Arrange them so that the hypotenuses form a smaller, tilted square in the middle.\n\n3. The small tilted square that appears in the centre has side length \u2026 I think it\u2019s \\(c\\), so its area should be \\(c^2\\). (This is where I get a little confused \u2013 some proofs say the side of the inner square is \\(\\frac{c}{\\sqrt{2}}\\), but I\u2019ll stick with \\(c\\) for now.)\n\n4. Now, the area of the big square can be expressed in two ways:  \n\n   - Directly, as \\((a+b)^2\\).  \n   - As the sum of the areas of the four triangles plus the area of the inner square.\n\n   So we write  \n\n   \\[\n   (a+b)^2 = 4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}ab\\right) + c^2 .\n   \\]\n\n5. Simplify the right\u2011hand side:  \n\n   \\[\n   4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}ab\\right) = 2ab,\n   \\]\n\n   so we have  \n\n   \\[\n   (a+b)^2 = 2ab + c^2 .\n   \\]\n\n6. Expand the left\u2011hand side:  \n\n   \\[\n   (a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 .\n   \\]\n\n7. Set the two expressions equal:  \n\n   \\[\n   a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 2ab + c^2 .\n   \\]\n\n8. Cancel the \\(2ab\\) terms on both sides, leaving  \n\n   \\[\n   a^2 + b^2 = c^2 .\n   \\]\n\nSo, \u2026 I think that shows the Pythagorean theorem algebraically using a geometric picture of rearranging triangles inside a square.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely confident about the part where I assumed the inner square\u2019s side is \\(c\\); maybe that\u2019s where the proof could be tightened, but the basic idea should be right."

      "student_answer": "Um... I think the side is about 5 units.  \n\nIf the diagonal is 10, then using the Pythagorean theorem \\(a^2 + a^2 = 10^2\\), so \\(2a^2 = 100\\).  \nDividing both sides by 2 gives \\(a^2 = 50\\), and taking the square root I guess gives roughly \\(a \\approx 5\\) (since \\(\\sqrt{50}\\) is close to 5).  \n\nSo the side length should be about 5 units."
