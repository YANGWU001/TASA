  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of perimeter concepts, correctly calculating perimeters and explaining the differences between perimeter and area. However, the answer to Question 1 is incorrect, as the perimeter of the rectangle is actually 22 units, not 24. Overall, the student shows good comprehension and application of perimeter calculations.",

      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Perimeter is the total distance around the edge of a shape \u2013\u2011 kind of like how far you\u2019d have to walk if you went all the way around it.  It\u2019s measured in linear units (like centimeters or feet), not in square units.  In other words, you add up the lengths of all the sides to get the perimeter."

      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is the sum of the three side lengths:\n\n\\[\n5\\text{\u202fcm} + 7\\text{\u202fcm} + 10\\text{\u202fcm} = 22\\text{\u202fcm}.\n\\]\n\nSo the perimeter should be **22\u202fcm**."

      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter of a polygon is the total length you\u2019d get if you walked all the way around its edges \u2013 you just add up the lengths of all the sides. The area, on the other hand, is a measure of how much space is inside the shape; it tells you how many square units it covers.  \n\nSo basically, perimeter is a linear measurement (like meters or feet), while area is measured in square units (like square meters or square feet). (I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s the main difference, though I might be mixing up the units a bit.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a rectangular garden tells you how far around the whole garden the fence has to go, so it\u2019s the first thing you need to figure out when you buy fencing material.\u202fIf you know the perimeter you can calculate the total length of fence required and, from that, estimate the cost of the fence (since most fencing is sold by the linear foot or meter).  \n\nIt also helps you plan where the fence posts will go \u2013 you\u2019ll space the posts at regular intervals along the total distance, so a correct perimeter makes the layout much easier.  \n\nSometimes people mix up perimeter with area, but while the area tells you how much planting space you have, the perimeter is what controls the amount of boundary material you need.  \n\nSo, in short, the perimeter is important because it directly determines the length (and therefore the material and price) of the fence you\u2019ll need for the garden."

      "student_answer": "The perimeter (circumference) of a circle is found with the formula  \n\n\\[\nC = 2\\pi r\n\\]\n\nso for a radius of\u202f7\u202fcm you would use \\(C = 2\\pi \\times 7\\)."

      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter is the sum of all five side lengths:\n\n\\(3 \\text{\u202fcm} + 5 \\text{\u202fcm} + 4 \\text{\u202fcm} + 6 \\text{\u202fcm} + 2 \\text{\u202fcm} = 20 \\text{\u202fcm}\\).\n\nSo the total perimeter of the pentagon is **20\u202fcm**."
