  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic equation-solving techniques, successfully solving several equations correctly. However, there are notable mistakes in some answers, particularly in the first question and the explanation of the third question. The student should focus on careful arithmetic operations and double-check their work to avoid errors.",
