However, in Question 8, the calculation of distance is incorrect; the correct answer should be 20 miles, but the student stated it correctly. Overall, the student has a solid grasp of the concepts.",

      "student_answer": "I think the formula is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{rate} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}}\n\\]\n\n(so speed or rate is obtained by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken)."

      "student_answer": "The basic formula that ties the three quantities together is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} .\n\\]\n\nTo isolate **time**, you can rearrange the equation just like you would with any algebraic expression:\n\n1. Start with\u202fRate\u202f=\u202fDistance\u202f\u00f7\u202fTime.  \n2. Multiply both sides of the equation by\u202fTime\u202fto get\u202fRate\u202f\u00d7\u202fTime\u202f=\u202fDistance.  \n3. Then divide both sides by\u202fRate\u202fto solve for\u202fTime.\n\nSo the rearranged formula is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Rate}} }.\n\\]\n\nIn words, the time it takes to travel a certain distance is equal to the distance divided by the speed (rate)."

By knowing the relationship\u202f\\( \\text{distance}= \\text{rate}\\times\\text{time} \\) you can work out how long the trip will take at a given speed, or what speed you need to maintain to arrive at a certain time.  \n\nFor instance, if you plan to leave at 8\u202fa.m. and want to be there by noon, you have\u202f4\u202fhours available. Using the formula you\u2019d calculate the required average speed as  \n\n\\[\n\\text{rate}= \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}} = \\frac{300\\text{\u202fmi}}{4\\text{\u202fh}} = 75\\text{\u202fmph}.\n\\]\n\nSo you know you\u2019ll need to average about\u202f75\u202fmph (allowing for stops, traffic, etc.).  \n\nI think this same idea is useful for delivery drivers, too: they can estimate how many packages they can drop off in a shift by figuring out how far they can travel at a certain speed in the allotted time.  \n\n*(One small slip I sometimes make is mixing up the formula for time\u2014I might mistakenly write\u202ftime\u202f=\u202fdistance\u202f\u00d7\u202frate, which is actually incorrect; the correct relation is\u202ftime\u202f=\u202fdistance\u202f\u00f7\u202frate.)*"
