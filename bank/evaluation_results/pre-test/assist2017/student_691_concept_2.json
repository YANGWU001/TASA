      "student_answer": "Point\u2011plotting is the process of representing ordered pairs \\((x,\\;y)\\) as points on a two\u2011dimensional coordinate plane.  \n\n**Steps**\n\n1. **Identify the coordinates** \u2013 Write the point in ordered\u2011pair form \\((x, y)\\), where\u202f\\(x\\) is the horizontal (\u202f*abscissa*\u202f) value and\u202f\\(y\\) is the vertical (\u202f*ordinate*\u202f) value.  \n2. **Locate the \\(x\\)-value** \u2013 Starting at the origin \\((0,0)\\), move **right** if \\(x\\) is positive or **left** if \\(x\\) is negative, counting units equal to \\(|x|\\) along the horizontal axis.  \n3. **Locate the \\(y\\)-value** \u2013 From the position reached in step\u202f2, move **up** if \\(y\\) is positive or **down** if \\(y\\) is negative, counting \\(|y|\\) units along the vertical axis.  \n4. **Mark the point** \u2013 Place a dot (or a small \u201c\\(\\times\\)\u201d) at the final location. This dot represents the ordered pair \\((x, y)\\).  \n5. **Label (optional)** \u2013 Write the coordinates next to the dot to indicate which point has been plotted.\n\nBy repeating these steps for each ordered pair, you can graph data, visualize relationships, or solve geometric problems on the coordinate plane."

      "student_answer": "To find the coordinates of a point on a graph, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the point** \u2013 Locate the exact spot on the graph that you\u2019re interested in.  \n2. **Read the horizontal (x\u2011axis) value** \u2013 Drop a vertical line from the point down to the x\u2011axis. The number where this line meets the axis is the *x\u2011coordinate*.  \n3. **Read the vertical (y\u2011axis) value** \u2013 Drop a horizontal line from the point over to the y\u2011axis. The number where this line meets the axis is the *y\u2011coordinate*.  \n4. **Write the ordered pair** \u2013 Combine the two numbers as \\((x,\\,y)\\). The first entry is the x\u2011coordinate, the second is the y\u2011coordinate.\n\n**Example**  \nIf a point lies directly above\u202f3 on the x\u2011axis and aligns with\u202f\u20112 on the y\u2011axis, its coordinates are \\((3,\\,-2)\\).\n\n**Tip** \u2013 If you\u2019re working from an equation (e.g., \\(y = 2x + 1\\)), you can also determine a point\u2019s coordinates by choosing a value for \\(x\\), computing the corresponding \\(y\\) using the equation, and then plotting the resulting \\((x, y)\\) pair."

On the graph,\u202f*x*\u202f=\u202f0 lies exactly on the\u202f*y*\u2011axis, so you start at the origin.  \n\n4. **Locate the\u202f*y*\u2011coordinate** \u2013 From the origin move **upward** along the\u202f*y*\u2011axis 6 units (since the\u202f*y*\u2011value is\u202f+6).  \n\n5. **Mark the point** \u2013 Put a small dot or a cross at the position you have reached.  \n\n6. **Label the point** \u2013 Write \u201c(0,\u202f6)\u201d next to the dot (or simply note that it is on the\u202f*y*\u2011axis at\u202fy\u202f=\u202f6).  \n\n---\n\n**What the result tells you**\n\n- The point lies **on the\u202f*y*\u2011axis** because its\u202f*x*\u2011coordinate is zero.  \n- It is **6 units above the origin**, so its distance from the origin along the\u202f*y*\u2011axis is\u202f6.  \n- In the context of a function or a graph, (0,\u202f6) would be the **y\u2011intercept**\u2014the value where the graph crosses the\u202f*y*\u2011axis.  \n\nThus, plotting (0,\u202f6) shows a point that tells you the graph meets the\u202f*y*\u2011axis at a height of\u202f6."

Because of this, the origin serves as the \u201ccenter\u201d from which all other points are measured: a point\u2019s x\u2011coordinate tells how far it is to the right (positive) or left (negative) of the origin, and its y\u2011coordinate tells how far it is above (positive) or below (negative) the origin. The four quadrants of the plane are also defined relative to the origin. In short, the origin is the anchor that gives meaning to every other plotted point."
