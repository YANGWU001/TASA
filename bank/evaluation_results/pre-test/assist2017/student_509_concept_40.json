      "student_answer": "Division is the math operation that tells us how a whole can be split into equal parts or how many times one number fits into another.\u202fIf you have a total amount and you want to share it evenly among a certain number of groups, you divide the total by the number of groups. The result (the quotient) shows the size of each equal part. In other words, division answers the question \u201chow many groups of this size are in the whole?\u201d or \u201chow big is each piece when the whole is divided evenly.\u201d"

The product equals the dividend, so the answer is right.  \n\n*Example with a remainder:*\u202f\\(97 \u00f7 8 = 12\\)\u202fR\u202f1.  \nCheck: \\(12 \u00d7 8 = 96\\); \\(96 + 1 = 97\\).  The sum matches the dividend, confirming the answer."
