      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what 'percent-of' means and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 So, \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is kind of like when you take a part of something and write it as a fraction of 100. I think it means you\u2019re finding a piece of a whole, but you always think of the whole as 100 units. \n\nFor example, if you have 30\u202f% of a pizza, you\u2019re supposed to have 30 out of 100 slices\u2026 or maybe 30\u202f% of a pizza means you have 30\u202f% of the whole pizza, which would be like 0.3 of it. So if the pizza had 10 slices, 30\u202f% of it would be 3 slices. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s what \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d means."

      "question": "If a family spends 35% of their monthly income of $4000 on rent, how much is spent on rent?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... maybe it's around $1,300?  I\u2019m not totally sure, but 35\u202f% of $4,000 seems like it would be a little over a thousand, so I\u2019m guessing roughly **$1,300** for the rent."
