  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the sum of interior angles in a triangle, particularly in their explanation for why the sum is 180 degrees and in their reasoning about obtuse angles. However, there are significant misconceptions in other answers, such as confusing the sum of angles in a triangle with that of a quadrilateral, and incorrectly calculating the third angle. Overall, the student needs to strengthen their grasp of triangle properties and angle relationships.",

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason the interior angles of a triangle always add up to 180\u00b0 has to do with the fact that a triangle can be \u201cunfolded\u201d into a straight line. If you take one of the sides and extend it, the two adjacent angles become a straight angle, which is 180\u00b0, and the third angle just fills in the rest of the line. So when you put all three angles together they have to total that straight\u2011line amount, which is 180 degrees. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess it\u2019s because a triangle is made of three corners that together make a flat line, and a flat line is 180\u00b0."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a triangle actually *can* have interior angles that add up to more than\u202f180\u202fdegrees. Like, if you make one of the corners really big\u2014say, an angle of 120\u00b0\u2014and the other two are also pretty big, you could end up with a total over 180\u00b0. So I guess it\u2019s possible, because the angles don\u2019t have a strict limit as long as they still kind of meet at the vertices. (I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How do the sum of the interior angles of a triangle compare to the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the interior angles of a triangle add up to\u202f180\u00b0, and for a quadrilateral they add up to about\u202f270\u00b0. So the quadrilateral\u2019s total is roughly one\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half times the triangle\u2019s sum."

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea is to use the fact that the interior angles of any triangle add up to\u202f180\u00b0, right? So if we suppose a triangle had two obtuse angles\u2026 an obtuse angle is bigger than 90\u00b0, so let\u2019s call them \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).  \n\nIf both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are greater than 90\u00b0, then together they\u2019re already more than 180\u00b0 (because \\(90\u00b0+90\u00b0 = 180\u00b0\\) and each is a little bit bigger). That would leave the third angle \\(C\\) to be a negative number, which doesn\u2019t make sense for an angle.  \n\nSo\u2026 I guess that shows a triangle can\u2019t have two obtuse angles because the sum would exceed 180\u00b0.  \n\n(\u2026or maybe I\u2019m mixing something up, but that\u2019s the best I can remember.)"

      "question": "What is the relationship between the sum of interior angles of a triangle and the exterior angles of a triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the interior angles and the exterior angles of a triangle are kind of the same thing. Like, if you add up all the interior angles you get 180\u00b0, and if you add up all the exterior angles you also get 180\u00b0. So basically the sums are equal\u2014you just get the same total whether you look inside or outside the triangle. (I'm not totally sure, though.)"
