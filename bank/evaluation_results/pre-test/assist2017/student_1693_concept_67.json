  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of fractions, correctly solving most problems. However, there was an error in simplifying 8/12, which should be 2/3 instead of 2/3. Additionally, in Question 10, the student incorrectly calculated the remaining fraction of the bag. Overall, the student shows good reasoning and problem-solving skills with fractions.",
