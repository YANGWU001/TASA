      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "**Using proportions to scale a recipe**\n\n1. **Identify what you know**  \n   - Original serving size (how many people the recipe is written for).  \n   - Amount of each ingredient in the original recipe.  \n   - Desired serving size (how many people you want to feed).\n\n2. **Set up a proportion**  \n   The basic idea is that the **ratio of ingredient\u2011amount to servings stays the same**.  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{original amount}}{\\text{original servings}} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\text{new amount}}{\\text{new servings}}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for the unknown (new amount)**  \n   Rearrange the proportion:\n   \\[\n   \\text{new amount} \\;=\\; \\text{original amount} \\times \\frac{\\text{new servings}}{\\text{original servings}}\n   \\]\n   The factor \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{\\text{new servings}}{\\text{original servings}}\\) tells you how much to multiply every ingredient by.\n\n4. **Example**  \n   The recipe makes **4 servings** and calls for **2\u202fcups of flour**.  \n   You need to serve **10 people**.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{scale factor}= \\frac{10}{4}=2.5\n   \\]\n\n   New flour amount:\n   \\[\n   2\\text{\u202fcups} \\times 2.5 = 5\\text{\u202fcups}\n   \\]\n\n   Do the same calculation for the other ingredients (e.g., 1\u202ftbsp sugar \u2192 2.5\u202ftbsp, \u00bd\u202ftsp salt \u2192 1.25\u202ftsp, etc.).\n\n5. **Check units and practicality**  \n   - Keep the same measurement units (cups stay cups, teaspoons stay teaspoons).  \n   - If the result is a fraction that is hard to measure (e.g., 1.25\u202ftsp), you can convert it to a more convenient form (1\u202f\u00bc\u202ftsp).\n\n6. **What does *not* scale?**  \n   - **Cooking temperature** typically stays the same; only the time may need a slight adjustment.  \n   - Some delicate recipes (e.g., certain baked goods) may need a bit of tweaking beyond a pure proportion, but the proportion gives a solid first estimate.\n\n7. **Why it works**  \n   Proportions guarantee that the **relative ratios of ingredients remain constant**, preserving the flavor balance and texture of the original recipe while simply changing the quantity.\n\n---  \n\n**Bottom line:** Write a proportion that links ingredient amount to servings, solve for the new amounts, and then adjust only the cooking time (not the temperature) as needed. This makes it easy to turn a recipe for 2 people into one for 12, or to shrink a big holiday dish down to a single serving."

      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "A **ratio** is a way of comparing two quantities by showing how many times one value contains or is contained in the other. It is expressed as a single fraction or with the \u201cto\u201d notation, e.g.,\u202f3\u202f:\u202f4 or\u202f3/4, meaning \u201cfor every 3 of the first thing there are 4 of the second.\u201d\n\nA **proportion** is a statement that two ratios are equal to each other. It links *two* ratios (or fractions) together in an equation, e.g.,\u202f3\u202f:\u202f4\u202f=\u202f6\u202f:\u202f8 or\u202f3/4\u202f=\u202f6/8. In a proportion the relationship between the numbers in each ratio is the same, so the cross\u2011products are equal (3\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f4\u202f\u00d7\u202f6).  \n\nIn short: a ratio compares *two* quantities; a proportion says that *two* such comparisons are equivalent."

      "student_answer": "Cross\u2011multiplication is a quick way to check whether two ratios are equivalent\u2014that is, whether they make a true proportion.\n\nSuppose you have the two ratios  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad\\frac{c}{d}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a,\\;b,\\;c,\\;d\\) are non\u2011zero numbers.  \nThese ratios form a proportion (they are equal) exactly when  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}= \\frac{c}{d}.\n\\]\n\nTo test this without actually dividing, multiply the numerator of each fraction by the denominator of the other fraction (cross\u2011multiply):\n\n\\[\na \\times d \\quad\\text{and}\\quad b \\times c.\n\\]\n\nIf the two products are the **same**, i.e.\n\n\\[\nad = bc,\n\\]\n\nthen the original ratios are equal and they do form a proportion.  \nIf the products differ, the ratios are not equivalent and no proportion exists.\n\n**Example**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\frac{9}{12}\n\\]\n\nCross\u2011multiply:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 12 = 36,\\qquad 4 \\times 9 = 36.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(36 = 36\\), the two ratios are equal, so \\(\\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{9}{12}\\) and they form a proportion.\n\nIn summary, cross\u2011multiplication reduces the problem of comparing fractions to a simple equality of two products: **if \\(ad = bc\\), the ratios form a proportion; otherwise, they do not.**"
