  "feedback": "The student shows a limited understanding of equations and their properties. Most answers reflect confusion about basic concepts, such as the definition of an equation and the role of variables. The only correct answer was for the quadratic equation, indicating some grasp of factoring. Overall, the student needs to review fundamental concepts and clarify their understanding of equations and expressions.",

      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think an equation is kind of like a formula that tells you how to calculate something rather than a statement that two things are equal. Maybe it\u2019s just a rule for finding values, not really an equality."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation is just a math sentence that has numbers and maybe variables, but it doesn\u2019t really have an \u201cequals\u201d sign. An expression, on the other hand, is something that actually says two things are equal, like 3\u202f+\u202fx\u202f=\u202f7. So basically the expression is the part that tells you they\u2019re the same, and the equation is just the collection of terms. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you\u2019d solve it like this:\n\n\\(2x + 5 = 15\\)\n\nFirst subtract 5 from both sides:  \n\\(2x = 10\\)\n\nThen divide by 2:  \n\\(x = 10\\)\n\nSo\u2026 I guess \\(x = 10\\)."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole point of \u201cbalancing\u201d an equation is mostly just to make it look neat, like you want the left\u2011hand side and the right\u2011hand side to have the same number of terms or look the same size. It\u2019s not really about keeping the equality true when you solve for something \u2013 it\u2019s just a way to keep the equation looking tidy."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one simple real\u2011life example could be something like buying apples.  Like, say I have 5 apples and each apple costs $2, then the total cost would be \u2026 well, I guess you\u2019d just add them, so 5\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f7 dollars.  So the equation \u201c5\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f7\u201d would represent the situation.  (I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the right way to set it up, but maybe it works?)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cno solution\u201d means that the equation is kind of\u2026 always true no matter what number you plug in, so there isn\u2019t a single specific answer that solves it. In other words, it doesn\u2019t have one particular value that works, because it works for all values."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you figure out whether a solution works by kind of \u201ctesting\u201d it against the equation. Like, you take the number you got and plug it in, and then you look at the picture of the equation \u2013 if the point you plug in ends up somewhere on the graph, then it\u2019s a solution. So basically you just see if the point lies on the curve; if it does, the solution is good. If it\u2019s off the curve, then it doesn\u2019t satisfy the equation. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the equation factors to \\((x-1)(x-6)=0\\), so the solutions would be  \n\n\\[\nx = 1 \\text{ or } x = 6.\n\\]"

      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think inverse operations are basically the thing you do to flip the whole equation around\u2014like you \u201cundo\u201d it by swapping the left\u2011hand side with the right\u2011hand side and then applying the opposite operation. So if you have something like\u202f\\(2x + 5 = 11\\), you\u2019d first switch the sides to get\u202f\\(11 = 2x + 5\\) and then do the opposite operation (subtract 5, divide by 2) to solve for\u202f\\(x\\). In short, inverse operations let you reverse the equation by swapping sides and then using opposite actions to isolate the variable."
