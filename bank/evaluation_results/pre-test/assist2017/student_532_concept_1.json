  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the sum of interior angles in polygons, correctly applying the formula and explaining the concepts. There was a minor error in Question 3 regarding the number of sides for a polygon with a sum of 1080 degrees, which should have been 6 sides, not 8. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the topic.",

      "student_answer": "A polygon can be divided into triangles by drawing diagonals from one vertex to all the other non\u2011adjacent vertices.  \nIf the polygon has \\(n\\) sides, this creates exactly \\(n-2\\) triangles.  \n\nSince each triangle\u2019s interior angles add up to \\(180^\\circ\\), the total sum of the interior angles of the polygon is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = (n-2)\\times 180^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nThus, as you increase the number of sides \\(n\\), the factor \\((n-2)\\) becomes larger, and the overall sum of the interior angles grows linearly. In other words, every time you add an extra side (and the corresponding diagonal), you are effectively adding another triangle, which contributes an additional \\(180^\\circ\\) to the total angle sum. Hence the interior\u2011angle sum increases as the polygon gets more sides."

The interior\u2011angle sum depends on the number of sides (\\((n-2)\u00b7180\u00b0\\)), whereas the exterior\u2011angle sum is constant at \\(360\u00b0\\).  \n2.

      "student_answer": "To find the sum of the interior angles of any polygon that has more than three sides, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Count the number of sides** of the polygon and call it\u202f\\(n\\). (For example, a pentagon has \\(n = 5\\).)\n\n2. **Divide the polygon into triangles** by drawing diagonals from one single vertex to all the other non\u2011adjacent vertices.  \n   - Each diagonal you draw creates a new triangle, and the triangles you get will not overlap.  \n   - The number of triangles you obtain this way is always\u202f\\(n - 2\\).  \n   - (You can picture it as \u201ccutting\u201d the polygon into the maximum number of triangles that fit inside it.)\n\n3. **Use the fact that each triangle\u2019s interior angles add up to\u202f\\(180^\\circ\\).**  \n   - Since you have \\(n - 2\\) triangles, the total sum of all the angles in all those triangles is \\((n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\\).\n\n4. **Recognize that the angles of the triangles together are exactly the interior angles of the original polygon.**  \n   - When you add up the interior angles of the polygon, you\u2019re really adding up the angles from all those triangles, so the sum is the same.\n\n5. **Write the final formula:**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2)\\times 180^\\circ .\n   \\]\n\n**Example:** For a hexagon (\\(n = 6\\)):\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = (6 - 2)\\times 180^\\circ = 4 \\times 180^\\circ = 720^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nThat\u2019s the complete process: count the sides, break the shape into \\(n-2\\) triangles, multiply the number of triangles by \\(180^\\circ\\), and you have the sum of the interior angles."
