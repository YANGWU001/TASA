However, there are significant misconceptions regarding definitions and properties, particularly in questions about angles and symmetry.

      "question": "What is the definition of an isosceles triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think an isosceles triangle is a triangle that has two equal **angles**.  I'm not completely sure, but I remember hearing that the angles are the same rather than the sides."

      "question": "How many sides of an isosceles triangle are of equal length?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think maybe only **one side** is of equal length."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If two angles of a triangle are equal, can it be classified as an isosceles triangle? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think that just having two angles equal doesn\u2019t automatically make a triangle isosceles.  The definition of an isosceles triangle is that it has **two equal sides**, not two equal angles.  So you could have a triangle where two angles happen to be the same size, but the sides opposite those angles might still be different lengths because the triangle could be strangely scaled or something.  In that case the triangle wouldn\u2019t be called isosceles even though the angles match.  That\u2019s why the classification is based on side lengths, not angle measures."

      "question": "An isosceles triangle has two sides of length 5 cm. What can you say about the third side?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the third side has to be the same length as the other two, so it would also be 5\u202fcm.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about isosceles triangles.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What is the relationship between the base angles of an isosceles triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the two base angles in an isosceles triangle aren\u2019t necessarily the same. Maybe they\u2019re just two different angles that together add up to something like 180\u00b0 with the vertex angle, rather than being equal to each other."

      "question": "Draw an isosceles triangle and label its equal sides and angles. Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019ll try to draw an isosceles triangle.  \n\nI picture a triangle with a flat base on the bottom and a pointy tip at the top. I think the two sides that go from the bottom corners up to the top point are the *different* sides, and the base (the bottom side) is the one that\u2019s equal to the left side. So I\u2019d label the bottom side \u201ca\u201d and the left\u2011hand side \u201ca\u201d too, and the right\u2011hand side \u201cb\u201d.  \n\nFor the angles, I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the two angles at the bottom are the ones that are equal, so I\u2019d call those \u201c\u03b1\u201d and \u201c\u03b1\u201d. I also think the angle at the top is the same as the bottom ones, so maybe I should label it \u201c\u03b1\u201d as well.  \n\nMy reasoning is kind of fuzzy: I remember that an isosceles triangle has two equal *things*, but I get mixed up about whether it\u2019s the sides or the angles that have to match. I thought the base and one of the legs were the same length, and that the bottom angles were the same because they\u2019re opposite the equal sides\u2014well, at least something like that.  \n\nSorry if this is messy; I\u2019m still trying to sort out which parts should be equal."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think this triangle is **not** isosceles.\u202fEven though two sides are both 7\u202fcm, the third side is 10\u202fcm, which is different, so the sides aren\u2019t all the same. Because the lengths aren\u2019t all equal, I guess it can\u2019t be called an isosceles triangle.  (\u2026I\u2019m a bit confused, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking.)"

      "question": "Can an isosceles triangle also be a right triangle? Provide an example or counterexample.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think an isosceles triangle can\u2019t be a right triangle.  In an isosceles triangle the two equal sides make the base angles the same, and that usually means none of the angles is 90\u00b0.  So, for example, a triangle with sides 5\u202fcm,\u202f5\u202fcm,\u202f8\u202fcm is isosceles, but it\u2019s not right\u2011angled, and I don\u2019t think you can find an isosceles triangle that also has a 90\u00b0 angle.  (I guess that means the answer is \u201cno,\u201d an isosceles triangle can\u2019t be a right triangle.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe how the symmetry of an isosceles triangle can help determine its properties.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the symmetry of an isosceles triangle is kind of like the way a circle is symmetric, so you can sort of rotate the whole triangle and it looks the same. Because of that, I guess all three sides end up being the same length, right? That would mean an isosceles triangle is actually the same as an equilateral triangle, which makes the math a little easier.\n\nAlso, since the triangle is symmetric, the height from the top vertex to the base should split the base into three equal parts instead of two, so you can use that to find the lengths of the sides. I guess the angles at the base are also equal to the top angle because of the symmetry, so you can just divide 180\u00b0 by three and get 60\u00b0 for each angle. \n\nSo basically, the symmetry lets you treat the triangle as if it were completely regular, and then you can just use the usual formulas for an equilateral triangle to find side lengths and angles."
