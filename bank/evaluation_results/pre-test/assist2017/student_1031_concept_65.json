      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the link between a length and an area is kind of simple: you just use the same conversion factor you\u2019d use for a linear measurement, but you apply it to the area directly.\u202fSo, for example, if 1\u202finch equals\u202f2.54\u202fcm, then 1\u202fsquare\u202finch would also be\u202f2.54\u202fcm\u202f(squared isn\u2019t needed). In other words, you just \u201ccarry over\u201d the linear factor without changing it when you go to area units.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, though\u2026)"

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain how volume conversion is related to linear and area measurements.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think volume conversion is kind of tied to the linear and area stuff because you\u2019re basically just multiplying the three dimensions together. So, if you have a length in meters and you want a volume in cubic meters, you\u2019d just take the length, square it to get an area, and then multiply by the length again to get the volume. In other words, you go from a linear measurement\u202f\u2192\u202farea measurement\u202f\u2192\u202fvolume measurement by \u201cadding\u201d another dimension.\n\nBecause of that, when you convert a volume from one unit to another (like cubic centimeters to cubic inches), you have to remember the conversion factor for the linear measurement and then **cube** it. For example, 1\u202fcm\u202f=\u202f0.3937\u202fin, so 1\u202fcm\u00b3\u202f=\u202f(0.3937)\u00b3\u202fin\u00b3 \u2248\u202f0.061\u202fin\u00b3. So the linear conversion factor is just raised to the third power.\n\nI guess that\u2019s why sometimes people talk about \u201carea conversion\u201d when they\u2019re actually dealing with volume \u2013 you\u2019re just one step further than area. If you wanted to convert a volume in liters to cubic meters, you\u2019d remember that 1\u202fL\u202f=\u202f0.001\u202fm\u00b3, which is basically a linear factor of 0.1 (since 1\u202fL\u202f=\u202f10\u202fcm\u00b3) and then you adjust for the three dimensions.\n\nSo, yeah\u2026 volume conversion is related to linear and area because you\u2019re essentially scaling the linear factor up to the third power, and you have to keep track of the units at each step."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the volume might be\u2026 well, the edge is 3\u202fcm, so maybe you just do 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3, which is 9. So I guess the volume is about **9\u202fcm\u00b3**.  (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

      "question": "Describe the steps required to convert a measurement from square meters to square centimeters.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the process is kind of like this:\n\n1. Remember that 1\u202fmeter = 100\u202fcentimeters.  \n2. Since you\u2019re dealing with a **square** measurement, you just keep the same factor and multiply the number of square meters by 100 to get square centimeters.  \n3. So you would take the value in\u202fm\u00b2 and **multiply it by 100** to get the value in\u202fcm\u00b2.  \n\nThat\u2019s it, right? \u2014 I\u2019m not completely sure, but I think that\u2019s how you convert square meters to square centimeters."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason we square the linear conversion factor is kinda weird\u2026\u202fWhen we\u2019re changing from one area unit to another, we actually have to turn the length\u2011conversion number into a volume\u2011type factor, so we square it to make everything line up. It\u2019s not really about the two dimensions of the area\u2014it's more about keeping the units consistent by turning the length factor into a \u201cbigger\u201d factor.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Provide an example where linear, area, and volume conversions are all used in a real-world scenario.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a good real\u2011world example is something like building a swimming pool.  \n\nFirst you\u2019d need **linear** conversions to figure out the length of the pipe that will carry water in and out of the pool \u2013 for example, you might have a 20\u2011foot pipe but the plans are in meters, so you\u2019d convert 20\u202fft\u202f\u2248\u202f6.1\u202fm.  \n\nThen you\u2019d use **area** conversions for the pool\u2019s floor and the deck around it. If the pool is 10\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202fm, that\u2019s 50\u202fm\u00b2, but the contractor might be ordering tile that\u2019s sold in square feet, so you\u2019d convert 50\u202fm\u00b2\u202f\u2248\u202f538\u202fft\u00b2.  \n\nFinally you\u2019d need a **volume** conversion to know how much water the pool holds. You could calculate the volume as length\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth\u202f\u00d7\u202faverage depth \u2013 say 10\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fm\u202f=\u202f100\u202fm\u00b3 \u2013 and then convert that to gallons (about 26\u202f400\u202fgal) because the water company charges per gallon.  \n\nSo in this scenario you\u2019re constantly jumping between linear, area, and volume units to get everything the right size.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure about the exact numbers, but I think that\u2019s the general idea.)"
