      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a rectangle is calculated by adding the length and the width together and then multiplying by 2. So, something like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = 2\\,(\\text{length} + \\text{width}).\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems right to me."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think area is actually the distance around a shape, like the total length of its sides, and perimeter is the amount of space that\u2019s inside the shape. So the \u201carea\u201d would be measured in regular units (like meters) and the \u201cperimeter\u201d would be measured in square units (like square meters).\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s how I remember them."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a circle is found by multiplying the radius by\u202f2\u03c0. So, if the radius is\u202fr, the area would be  \n\n**Area \u2248 2\u202f\u03c0\u202fr**."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we write area in \u201csquare\u201d units is kind of\u2026 because when we find the area we\u2019re actually adding up a bunch of little squares. Like, you take a length and a width, multiply them together, and that gives you a number of little unit\u2011by\u2011unit squares, so we write it as\u202fm\u00b2 or\u202fft\u00b2.\u202f\u2026but maybe it\u2019s also because area is actually a three\u2011dimensional thing and we just pretend it\u2019s flat by squaring the units?\u202fI\u2019m not really sure\u2014maybe it\u2019s just a convention to make the numbers look nicer."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think one place where you might need to calculate area is\u2026 like figuring out how much fuel a car will use on a trip.\u202fIf you know the area of the road you\u2019re driving on, you can sort of estimate how much gasoline you\u2019ll need, because a bigger road area would mean the car has to work harder and burn more fuel.\u202fSo, you\u2019d measure the length and width of the highway, get the total area, and then use that to decide how many gallons to fill up.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s why I guess area could be important in real life."
