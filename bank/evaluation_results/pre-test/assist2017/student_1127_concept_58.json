The only error was in Question 9, where the student miscalculated the probability of selecting a weekday.

      "question": "Explain the difference between theoretical probability and experimental probability.",
      "student_answer": "Theoretical probability is the \u201cwhat\u2011should\u2011happen\u201d chance that we calculate before we do anything, using the known set of equally\u2011likely outcomes.  \nFor example, if a fair coin is tossed, the theoretical probability of heads is\u202f1\u202ffavourable outcome divided by\u202f2\u202fpossible outcomes, so \\(P(\\text{heads}) = \u00bd\\).  This number comes from reasoning about the sample space, not from actually flipping the coin.\n\nExperimental probability (also called empirical or relative\u2011frequency probability) is the \u201cwhat\u2011actually\u2011happened\u201d chance that we get after we perform the experiment many times and count the results.  If we actually flip that same fair coin 100 times and see heads 48 times, the experimental probability of heads would be \\(48/100 = 0.48\\).  It is based on observed data and can differ from the theoretical value, especially when the number of trials is small.\n\nSo, in short:  \n\n* **Theoretical probability** \u2013 calculated from the known, idealized model of the situation (using formulas like favorable/total).  \n* **Experimental probability** \u2013 measured from real trials by counting how often the event occurs (relative frequency).  \n\nI think the main difference is that theoretical probability assumes perfect conditions, while experimental probability reflects what actually occurs in practice."

      "student_answer": "Mutually exclusive (or **disjoint**) events are events that **cannot happen together** in the same trial.  \nIn other words, if event\u202fA occurs, then event\u202fB cannot occur, and vice\u2011versa.  Mathematically this means  \n\n\\[\nP(A\\cap B)=0,\n\\]\n\nso the probability of both events occurring at the same time is zero.\n\n**Example:**  \nWhen you roll a single six\u2011sided die, the events  \n\n*\u202fA\u202f=\u202f\u201cthe die shows a 2\u201d*  \n\nand  \n\n*\u202fB\u202f=\u202f\u201cthe die shows a 5\u201d*  \n\nare mutually exclusive.  If the outcome is a 2, it certainly isn\u2019t a 5, and if the outcome is a 5, it certainly isn\u2019t a 2.  \n\n(Any similar pair\u2014such as \u201cgetting heads\u201d vs. \u201cgetting tails\u201d on a single coin flip\u2014would also illustrate mutually exclusive events.)"

      "student_answer": "For two events that are **independent**, the chance that both happen at the same time is just the product of their separate chances.  \n\nIn symbols, if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent,  \n\n\\[\nP(A\\;\\text{and}\\;B)=P(A)\\times P(B).\n\\]\n\n(If the events weren\u2019t independent you\u2019d have to use a different formula \u2013 e.g., \\(P(A\\text{ and }B)=P(A)\\,P(B\\mid A)\\).)"
