      "question": "If a number line shows integers from -5 to 5, where would the number -3 be located?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think the point for\u202f-3 would be two steps left of zero\u2014so around the \u20112 mark on the line."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does the position of a negative number on the number line differ from that of a positive number?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the negative numbers are actually shown on the right side of the zero on the number line, and the positive numbers are on the left. So a \u22125 would be to the right of\u202f0, while a\u202f+5 would be to the left. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the midpoint might be around\u202f\u20115. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I get."

      "question": "If a number line has points labeled -4, -2, 0, 2, and 4, what is the distance between -4 and 2?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the distance is probably **2** units.  (I'm not totally sure.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "On a number line, if a point is located halfway between -1 and 3, what number does it represent?",

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean if a number is to the left of 0 on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think if a number is to the left of\u202f0 on a number line it just means it\u2019s kind of\u2026 maybe a small positive number? Like it\u2019s close to zero but still on the left side.\u202fI guess it\u2019s not negative, just\u2026 something near zero."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe how you would locate the number 7 on a number line ranging from -10 to 10.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d start at the left\u2011most point, which is \u201310, and then count seven equal steps to the right. That would put you at \u20133 on the line. So I guess the point for \u201c7\u201d would be around \u20133."

      "question": "If the number line is divided into intervals of 1 and a point is marked at -6, what would be the coordinates if you moved 3 units to the right?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think if you start at\u202f-6\u202fand move\u202f3\u202funits to the right, you\u2019d end up at\u202f\u20119.  (I'm not really sure, though.)"
