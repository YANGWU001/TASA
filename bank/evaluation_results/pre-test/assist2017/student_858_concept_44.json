      "question": "Why is it necessary to multiply by the reciprocal when dividing fractions?",
      "student_answer": "When you divide one fraction by another you\u2019re basically asking \u201chow many of the second fraction fit into the first.\u201d  The easiest way to answer that is to turn the division into a multiplication, and the rule for doing that is to use the reciprocal (flip numerator and denominator) of the divisor.\n\nSo, for example  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4}\\div\\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\nmeans \u201chow many \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\)\u2019s are in \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)?\u201d  If you flip \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) to get its reciprocal \\(\\frac{5}{2}\\) and then multiply, you\u2019re effectively counting those pieces:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4}\\times\\frac{5}{2}= \\frac{15}{8}.\n\\]\n\nI think the reason this works is because division is the inverse operation of multiplication.  By multiplying by the reciprocal you\u2019re undoing the division step \u2013 you\u2019re replacing the \u201cdivide\u2011by\u201d action with an equivalent \u201cmultiply\u2011by\u2011the\u2011inverse\u201d action, which preserves the value.  (It also saves you from having to do a separate fraction\u2011division algorithm, which can get messy.)\n\nIn short, you multiply by the reciprocal because it converts the division problem into a multiplication problem that gives the same result, and multiplication of fractions is straightforward: you just multiply the numerators together and the denominators together."

So for any number\u202f\\(a\\),\n\n\\[\na \\div \\frac{9}{11}=a \\times \\frac{11}{9}.\n\\]\n\nThat\u2019s how the reciprocal relates to fraction\u2011division."
