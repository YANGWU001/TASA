      "student_answer": "I think the definition of divisibility is that an integer\u202f\\(a\\) is said to be divisible by another integer\u202f\\(b\\) (with\u202f\\(b \\neq 0\\)) if there exists an integer\u202f\\(k\\) such that  \n\n\\[\na = b \\times k.\n\\]\n\nIn other words, when you divide\u202f\\(a\\) by\u202f\\(b\\) you get no remainder."

      "student_answer": "I think\u202f135\u202fis divisible by\u202f5.  \nThe quick test for divisibility by\u202f5\u202fis to look at the last digit of the number: if it ends in\u202f0\u202for\u202f5, the number is a multiple of\u202f5. Since\u202f135\u202fends in a\u202f5, it passes that test, so it should be divisible by\u202f5.  \n\n(You could also check by doing the division:\u202f135\u202f\u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f27, which comes out to an exact whole number.)"

      "question": "What is the smallest positive integer divisible by both 4 and 6?",

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain why all even numbers are divisible by 2.",
      "student_answer": "I think an even number is any integer that can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk\u202ffor some whole\u2011number\u202fk. Because it is literally 2 multiplied by another integer, if you divide the number by\u202f2 you\u2019ll always get back that integer\u202fk\u202fwith no remainder. That\u2019s why every even number is divisible by\u202f2.\n\nFor example, 14\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f7, so 14\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f7, which is an integer; therefore 14 is divisible by\u202f2. The same works for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and so on.\n\nOne way many people notice this is that even numbers end in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202for\u202f8. Since they end in 0 they\u2019re automatically divisible by\u202f2. (Actually, the other ending digits\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202fand\u202f8 also guarantee divisibility by\u202f2, even though they don\u2019t end in 0.)"

      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f81 is divisible by\u202f9.\n\n**Justification:**  \nA quick way to check divisibility by\u202f9 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\n\\(8 + 1 = 9\\)\n\nSince 9 is itself a multiple of\u202f9, the original number (81) is also a multiple of\u202f9.  \nIndeed, \\(81 \u00f7 9 = 9\\) with no remainder, confirming that 81 is divisible by\u202f9."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Can a number be divisible by 10 if its last digit is not 0? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "I don\u2019t think a number can be divisible by\u202f10 unless its units digit is\u202f0.  \nThe reason is that 10 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5, so a number must be even (last digit even) **and** end in 0 or 5 to be a multiple of\u202f5. For it to satisfy both conditions at the same time, the only possible units digit is\u202f0. Therefore, if the last digit isn\u2019t\u202f0, the number can\u2019t be evenly divisible by\u202f10."

      "student_answer": "Yes, a number that is divisible by both\u202f8\u202fand\u202f12 must also be divisible by\u202f24.\n\n**Why:**  \n- Write the prime factorizations:  \n \u202f8\u202f=\u202f2\u00b3\u2003and\u200312\u202f=\u202f2\u00b2\u00b73.  \n- To be a multiple of both numbers, a number must contain at least the highest power of each prime that appears in either factorization.  \n \u202fThe highest power of\u202f2\u202fis\u202f2\u00b3, and the highest power of\u202f3\u202fis\u202f3\u00b9.  \n- Multiplying these gives the least common multiple (LCM):  \n \u202fLCM(8,\u202f12)\u202f=\u202f2\u00b3\u00b73\u202f=\u202f24.\n\nSince any common multiple of\u202f8\u202fand\u202f12 must be a multiple of their LCM, every number divisible by both\u202f8\u202fand\u202f12 is automatically a multiple of\u202f24.  (So it is necessarily divisible by\u202f24.)"
