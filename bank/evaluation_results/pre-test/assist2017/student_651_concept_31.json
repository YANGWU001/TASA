  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of transversals and their properties. Many answers contain significant inaccuracies, such as misconceptions about angles formed by transversals, the definition of corresponding angles, and the nature of vertical angles. The student should review the definitions and relationships between angles created by transversals, especially in the context of parallel lines.",

      "question": "What is a transversal in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think a transversal is kind of like a special kind of angle that you get when you draw a triangle inside a circle. It's something about the angles that intersect at the center, not really a line that cuts across other lines."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, how many angles are formed at the points of intersection?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it\u2019s probably **4 angles** in total."
    },

      "question": "Define the relationship between corresponding angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when a transversal cuts two parallel lines the\u202fcorresponding\u202fangles aren\u2019t equal \u2013 they\u2019re actually supplementary, so each pair adds up to 180\u00b0.  (I could be wrong, though.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me try to explain\u2026 I think alternate interior angles are the ones that are **on the same side of the transversal** and **between the two lines**. So you\u2019d look at the two angles that sit inside the parallel lines but on the same side of the crossing line, and those are the alternate interior angles. I guess they\u2019re supposed to be equal, but I\u2019m not totally sure."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a ladder leaning against a wall could be an example of a transversal. The wall and the floor are like two \u201clines,\u201d and the ladder crosses them, so maybe that\u2019s a real\u2011world situation where you can see a transversal. (I could be wrong, though.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is just any line that crosses two other lines, right?  So when it crosses two **parallel** lines, it makes a bunch of angles.  I guess the idea is that some of those angles add up to 180\u00b0, which is what \u201csupplementary\u201d means.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure which ones are supposed to be supplementary, but\u2026 maybe the angles that are on the same side of the transversal and **outside** the parallel lines are supplementary?  Like, if you look at the top\u2011right angle and the bottom\u2011right angle on the same side of the transversal, I think those two should add up to 180\u00b0.  (Or maybe it\u2019s the interior ones\u2026 I always get them mixed up.)\n\nAlso, I think the corresponding angles are supplementary too, because they\u2019re kind of \u201cmatching\u201d each other.  So the angle in the upper left corner and the angle right across from it should also sum to 180\u00b0, I guess.\n\nI remember something about \u201calternate interior angles\u201d being equal, but maybe they\u2019re also supplementary?  So the two interior angles that are on opposite sides of the transversal might add up to 180\u00b0 as well.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m not really sure which pairs are definitely supplementary, but the general idea is that the transversal creates several angle pairs that together make a straight line, so they have to total 180\u00b0.  That\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard, at least."

      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the difference is kind of... well, alternate interior angles are the ones that end up on the same side of the transversal **and** inside the two lines, while alternate exterior angles are the ones that are on the same side of the transversal **and** outside the two lines.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think vertical angles are equal because the transversal actually makes the opposite angles supplementary.\u202fSince supplementary angles add up to\u202f180\u00b0, each of those opposite angles would have to be\u202f90\u00b0\u202fso they end up the same size.\u202f\u2014 at least that\u2019s what I remember."
