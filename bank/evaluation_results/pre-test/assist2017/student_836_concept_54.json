They correctly calculated the sale price, the number of absent students, the number of people preferring coffee, the simplified fraction, the number of questions answered correctly, but made mistakes in other calculations. The student should focus on accurately applying the percent formulas and double-checking their work.",

If I\u2019m not messing it up, that fraction can be simplified by dividing the top and bottom by\u2026 maybe 5?  So I get \\(\\frac{35\\div5}{100\\div5} = \\frac{7}{10}\\). \n\n(I'm not totally sure if that\u2019s right, but that\u2019s what I got.)"
