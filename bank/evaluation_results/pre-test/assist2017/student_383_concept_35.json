  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of discounts, providing correct definitions and explanations for most questions. However, there are significant errors in calculations and some misconceptions about the purpose of discounts, particularly in questions 2, 5, 7, 8, and 10. More focus on accurate calculations and clearer understanding of financial strategies would improve performance.",

      "question": "What is the definition of a discount in financial terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount is just the amount you knock off the original price of something.  In other words, it\u2019s a percentage or amount that reduces the listed price\u202f\u2014\u202flike when a store puts a \u201c20\u202f% off\u201d sign on an item.  I\u2019m not really sure how it works in more technical finance stuff, but basically it\u2019s a reduction in the price you have to pay."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the price after the 20\u202f% discount would be about **$30**.  (I'm not completely sure, but that's what I get.)"

      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think businesses give discounts for a few reasons.  \n\nFirst, they want to **attract more customers** \u2013 a lower price can make people more likely to buy, especially if they\u2019re on the fence.  \n\nSecond, discounts can help **clear out inventory** that\u2019s not selling well or that\u2019s about to become outdated; by cutting the price they hope to move the stock faster.  \n\nThey also sometimes use discounts to **reward loyal customers** or to encourage people to buy in larger quantities (like \u201cbuy\u2011one\u2011get\u2011one\u2011half\u2011off\u201d).  \n\nSometimes a business will run a discount to **beat the competition** \u2013 if a rival is offering a sale, they might lower their own price to keep customers from switching.  \n\nUm\u2026 I\u2019ve also heard that discounts can actually **increase overall profit** because they bring in a lot more sales, even though each sale is for less money. (I\u2019m not totally sure about that part.)  \n\nFinally, they might use discounts as a **marketing tool** to get people\u2019s attention and create buzz around a new product, even if it means they\u2019re making less money on each unit sold.  \n\nSo, basically, discounts are a way to get more customers, move stock, keep up with competitors, and sometimes boost overall sales\u2014though they do mean lower profit per item."

      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there are a couple of discount types that are used a lot.\n\n**1. Percentage\u2011off discount** \u2013 This is when you take a certain percent away from the list price.  \n*Example:* A store might advertise \u201c20\u202f% off all jackets.\u201d If a jacket costs \\$150, the discount would be \\$30 and you\u2019d pay \\$120.\n\n**2. Fixed\u2011amount (cash) discount** \u2013 Instead of a percent, a set amount is subtracted from the price.  \n*Example:* \u201c\\$25 off any purchase over \\$100.\u201d So if you buy something that costs \\$130, the discount is \\$25 and you pay \\$105.\n\n(There are other kinds, like bulk or \u201cbuy\u2011one\u2011get\u2011one\u2011free,\u201d but those are the two I\u2019m most sure about.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount mainly makes a product look cheaper, so people might think it\u2019s **less** valuable or lower\u2011quality because the price is lower.\u202fBut at the same time, the lower price can make it seem like a good \u201cdeal,\u201d which can increase how attractive it feels and maybe even make people think they\u2019re getting more value for their money.\u202fSo a discount can both lower the perceived quality (because it\u2019s cheaper) and raise the perceived value (because it feels like a bargain)."

      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a company might use seasonal discounts mainly to\u2026 make their prices look higher later on. Like, they lower the price for a short period so customers get used to paying less, and then when the season is over they can raise the price and people will still buy because they\u2019re used to the \u201csale\u201d feeling.  \n\nAlso, I guess they might do it to\u2026 keep their stock from piling up, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s really a reason. Maybe they\u2019re trying to get rid of extra inventory so they don\u2019t have to store it for a long time, but I think the main idea is just to look like they\u2019re offering a good deal.  \n\nAs for benefits, I think it helps the company\u2026 get more cash quickly because people will rush to buy things when they\u2019re on sale, and that cash flow can be used for other stuff like hiring new staff. It might also\u2026 make the brand look more generous, so customers remember them and come back later when the prices go back up.  \n\nSo, in short, seasonal discounts are mostly a trick to let the company raise prices later and to make a quick cash boost, while also kinda clearing out inventory. I'm not totally sure about all of that, though."

      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a percentage\u2011based discount is when you take off a certain\u202f%\u202fof the original price\u2014so the amount you save changes depending on how expensive the item is. A fixed\u2011amount discount, on the other hand, is just a flat amount that gets subtracted no matter what the original price is.  \n\nSo, basically, the percentage discount is \u201cproportional\u201d to the price, while the fixed\u2011amount discount is a constant dollar (or whatever currency) amount.  \n\n\u2026but I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure if there are any other subtle differences\u2026 maybe they\u2019re calculated differently in taxes?  (I\u2019m kind of confused.)"
