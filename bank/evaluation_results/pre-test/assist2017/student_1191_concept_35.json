      "question": "What is the definition of a discount in financial terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a discount in finance is kind of like when a store lowers the price of something, but in financial terms it's... maybe the amount you subtract from the original price to get the sale price? Like if something costs $100 and there's a 20% discount, you just take off $20. So the discount is the dollar amount you take off, not really a rate or anything. I'm not totally sure, though."

      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think businesses give discounts mostly because they want to\u2026 I don\u2019t know, maybe to get rid of extra money? Like, if they have too much cash on hand they might just give some away so they don\u2019t have to keep it all. Or maybe they do it so customers feel like they\u2019re getting a good deal, but I\u2019m not really sure why that would help the business. I guess it could also be because they\u2019re bored and want to try something different, like offering a lower price just for fun. \n\nI\u2019m not really confident about that, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two common types of discounts are a **fixed\u2011amount discount** and a **tax\u2011discount**.  \n\n- A fixed\u2011amount discount is when a set dollar amount is taken off the regular price. For example, if a jacket is $80 and the store advertises \u201c$15 off,\u201d the price becomes $65.  \n\n- A tax\u2011discount (or tax\u2011exemption discount) is when the sales tax is removed from the price. For instance, if an item costs $50 and the sales tax would normally be $4, a tax\u2011discount would let you pay only the $50 without the $4 tax.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if those are the usual categories, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

      "question": "A store is offering a buy-one-get-one-50%-off deal. If the first item costs $40 and the second item costs $30, what is the total cost after applying the discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the discount works like you get half off the cheaper item. So half of $30 is $15 off, which would make the second item cost $15. Then you\u2019d pay $40 + $15 = **$55** total. \n\nBut\u2026 maybe the 50\u202f% off applies to the first item instead? If that\u2019s the case, half of $40 is $20 off, so the first item would be $20 and the second stays $30, giving a total of **$50**. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure which one is right\u2026 I guess it\u2019s probably the **$55** answer."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount actually makes the product seem **less** valuable to most people.  \nBecause the price is lower, customers might assume the store is trying to get rid of bad\u2011quality items, so the lower price kind of signals that the item isn\u2019t that great. In other words, the cheaper it gets, the less the product feels \u201cspecial,\u201d and people may not value it as highly as before.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it."

      "question": "Calculate the final cost of a $120 item after a 15% discount and a $10 coupon.",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me try\u2026  \nFirst I\u2019d take 15\u202f% of $120, which I think is $18. So the price after the discount would be $120\u202f\u2013\u202f$18 = $102.  \nThen I guess you subtract the $10 coupon, so\u2026 $102\u202f\u2013\u202f$10 = $92.\n\nBut\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing something up?  If the discount was applied after the coupon, it would be $120\u202f\u2013\u202f$10 = $110, and then 15\u202f% off that is $110\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.15 \u2248 $16.5, giving about $93.5.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure which way they want it\u2026 I\u2019ll go with **$108** as a guess."

      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a company might use seasonal discounts mainly because they want to\u2026\u202fsell a bunch of stuff when the season is over.  The idea is that customers are more likely to buy when something is on sale, so the firm can clear out inventory that would otherwise sit on the shelves.\u202fThat part is kind of right, I guess.\n\nAlso, I\u2011think they do it to\u2026\u202fboost their profits by raising prices later.  Like, after the discount period they can charge even higher prices because customers think the product is more valuable now.  I\u2019m not really sure how that works, but I\u2019ve heard something like that.\n\nAnother thing is that discounts can make the company look more competitive, so maybe they get more customers who might become loyal shoppers.  That could help them get more sales in the future\u2026\u202for at least that\u2019s what I think.\n\nFinally, I guess they sometimes use seasonal discounts to match the weather or holidays, but I\u2019m not totally clear on why that would matter.  Maybe it\u2019s just because people expect sales around those times, so the company doesn\u2019t want to miss out.  That\u2019s about all I can say."

      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a percentage\u2011based discount is when you take a specific dollar amount off the price, like \"$10 off,\" and a fixed\u2011amount discount is when you take a certain percent off, like \u201c20\u202f% off.\u201d  \n\nSo, basically the \u201cpercentage\u201d one is a flat amount, and the \u201cfixed\u2011amount\u201d one is a percent of the original price.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure if that's right, though.)"
