      "question": "Why is scientific notation useful when working with very large or very small numbers?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think scientific notation is useful because it lets us write really big or really tiny numbers in a shorter way, so they\u2019re easier to read.  It also\u2026 I guess it helps when we\u2019re doing calculations, like multiplication or division, because we can just add or subtract the exponents instead of dealing with all the zeros.  I\u2019m not completely sure, but I guess it also makes it easier to compare the size of numbers\u2026 maybe because the exponent tells you how big or small the number is.  (I\u2019m not positive about all of that, though.)"

Maybe it\u2019s 10\u202f\u00d7\u202f10^12, which would be 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10^13.  (I'm not confident about this.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How do you determine the exponent in scientific notation when converting a number to this form?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the exponent is just the number of zeros after the decimal point when you write the number in its normal form. So you count all the zeros that come after the decimal and that count becomes the exponent. If the decimal has to move to the left, you make the exponent negative; if it moves to the right you make it positive.\u202f \n\nFor example, if you have 0.0045, you\u2019d count three zeros after the decimal, so the exponent would be\u202f\u20133, giving\u202f4.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u207b\u00b3. If you have 1230, you\u2019d count the three zeros after the 1 and use\u202f+3 as the exponent, so it would be\u202f1.23\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I remember it."

      "question": "If a number in scientific notation is written as 7.89 x 10^8, what is its coefficient and what does the exponent represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the coefficient is the 7.89 part, and the exponent\u202f\u2014\u202fthe \u201c8\u201d in the 10\u2078\u202f\u2014\u202fjust tells you how many times you multiply by 8, not ten. So basically the exponent means you multiply the coefficient by 8."
