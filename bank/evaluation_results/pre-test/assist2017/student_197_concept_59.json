  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of combinatorics concepts. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion between permutations and combinations, as well as incorrect calculations for arrangements and selections. The only correct response is the example of a real-world scenario involving permutations, which shows some grasp of the concept. More study and practice are needed to solidify understanding.",

      "question": "What is the formula for calculating the number of combinations when choosing r items from a set of n items?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number of combinations is given by  \n\n\\[\nC(n,r)=\\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}\n\\]\n\n\u2014 or maybe I\u2019m mixing stuff up, but I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s something like that."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain the difference between permutations and combinations in your own words.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think permutations are the ones where the order **doesn\u2019t** matter, you just pick a group of items and it doesn\u2019t matter which way they\u2019re arranged. And combinations are when the order **does** matter, like you care about the sequence they appear in. So a permutation is like choosing a set, and a combination is like arranging them in a line. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it.)"

      "question": "How many ways can 5 books be arranged on a shelf?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the number of ways is probably pretty small. Maybe it's something like **20 ways** to arrange the five books."

      "question": "If a committee of 3 people is to be selected from a group of 10, how many different committees can be formed?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number of different committees is **30**.  \n\n(I'm not really sure\u2014it seems like we just pick 3 out of 10, so maybe we do something like \\(10 \\times 3 = 30\\).)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the number of possible passwords is \\(26^3\\). So maybe about **17,576** different passwords."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where permutations would be used instead of combinations, and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011world situation where you\u2019d use permutations instead of combinations is when you\u2019re **choosing the toppings for a pizza**.  \n\nFor example, suppose you have five possible toppings\u2014pepperoni, mushrooms, olives, onions, and extra cheese\u2014and you want to pick three of them for a pizza. The order in which the toppings are added matters, because the first topping you put on gets baked first, the second topping gets baked second, and so on, which changes the taste. So you\u2019d count the number of possible \u201cordered\u201d topping selections with a permutation formula:  \n\n\\[\nP(5,3)=\\frac{5!}{(5-3)!}=5\\times4\\times3=60\n\\]\n\nThis is different from a combination, where you\u2019d just care about which three toppings are on the pizza regardless of the order (which would be \\(\\binom{5}{3}=10\\)).  \n\nSo in this pizza\u2011topping case, permutations are appropriate because the order of adding the toppings is considered to affect the final product."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, how would you calculate the number of outcomes that satisfy at least one of two conditions?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the inclusion\u2011exclusion thing works like this: if you have two conditions\u202fA and\u202fB, the number of outcomes that satisfy at least one of them is  \n\n\\[\n|A\\cup B| \\;=\\; |A| \\;+\\; |B| \\;+\\; |A\\cap B|.\n\\]\n\nSo you add the sizes of the two sets and then\u2026 actually, you just add the overlap too, I guess.  (I\u2019m not totally sure about the sign on the intersection.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number of ways is given by choosing 2 students for one of the teams, so it would be  \n\n\\[\n\\binom{7}{2}=21.\n\\]\n\nSo there are **21** possible ways to form the two teams."
