  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of several key concepts related to linear equations, such as the definition of slope and y-intercept. However, there are critical misunderstandings in identifying slope from an equation and the definition of parallel lines. Additionally, the calculations for y-values and the interpretation of coefficients could be improved. Overall, the student shows promise but needs to clarify some fundamental concepts.",

      "question": "What does the slope in a linear equation represent in the context of a graph?",
      "student_answer": "I think the slope is basically the \u201csteepness\u201d of the line \u2013 it tells you how much\u202fy\u202fchanges for each one\u2011unit increase in\u202fx (the rise\u2011over\u2011run, or rate of change). So if the slope is 3, for every step right you go on the\u202fx\u2011axis the line goes up about three steps on the\u202fy\u2011axis.  \n\n(It also kind of gives you a sense of where the line meets the y\u2011axis, but the main idea is that it measures the rate at which\u202fy\u202fchanges as\u202fx\u202fchanges.)"

      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "When you look at the picture of a straight line, the easiest way to tell the sign of its slope is to follow the line from left\u2011to\u2011right (from the smaller\u2011x side toward the larger\u2011x side).\n\n* **If the line goes **upward** as you move to the right**, the y\u2011values are getting larger when x gets larger. That means the slope is **positive**.  \n* **If the line goes **downward** as you move to the right**, the y\u2011values are getting smaller when x gets larger. That means the slope is **negative**.  \n\nSo, essentially you just check the overall direction of the line:\n\n```\n   \u2191 (rising)  \u2192  positive slope\n   \u2193 (falling) \u2192  negative slope\n```\n\nA few other visual clues can help:\n\n1. **Steepness** \u2013 a steeper line (a large \u201crise\u201d for a given \u201crun\u201d) still follows the same rule; it\u2019s just a larger\u2011magnitude slope.  \n2. **Horizontal line** \u2013 if the line is perfectly horizontal, it doesn\u2019t rise or fall at all, so the slope is **zero** (neither positive nor negative).  \n3. **Vertical line** \u2013 a vertical line would have an \u201cundefined\u201d slope because you can\u2019t talk about a run; it\u2019s not really a linear function in the usual y = mx + b form.\n\nIn practice, you can also glance at the equation (if it\u2019s given) and look at the coefficient of x (the \u201cm\u201d in y = mx + b). If that number is positive, the line will rise; if it\u2019s negative, the line will fall. But just from the graph, the up\u2011or\u2011down direction from left to right tells you the sign of the slope."

      "student_answer": "I think the y\u2011intercept is the point where the line crosses the\u202fy\u2011axis at\u202f(7,\u202f0).  In other words, the graph would meet the vertical\u202fy\u2011axis at that coordinate."

      "student_answer": "To predict\u202f\\(y\\)\u202ffor new\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fvalues you treat the relationship as a straight\u2011line equation and just plug the\u202f\\(x\\)\u202finto it.  \n\n1. **Write the line in slope\u2011intercept form**  \n   \\[\n   y = mx + b\n   \\]  \n   where\u202f\\(m\\)\u202fis the slope (change in\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fover change in\u202f\\(x\\)) and\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fis the intercept.  (I think\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fis sometimes called the\u202f*x\u2011intercept*\u202f\u2013 you just need a constant term.)  \n\n2. **Find\u202f\\(m\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(b\\)** from the data you already have.  \n   - The slope is \\(\\displaystyle m=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\\).  \n   - Pick one of the known points \\((x_1,y_1)\\) and solve for\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fby rearranging \\(y_1 = m x_1 + b\\).  \n\n3. **Use the equation for any new\u202f\\(x\\)**.  \n   Substitute the new\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fvalue into \\(y = mx + b\\) and compute\u202f\\(y\\).  \n\n**Example** \u2013 Suppose the two known points are \\((1,2)\\) and \\((3,8)\\).  \n   - Slope:\u202f\\(m = (8-2)/(3-1) = 6/2 = 3\\).  \n   - Using \\((1,2)\\):\u202f\\(2 = 3(1) + b \\Rightarrow b = -1\\).  \n   - So the line is \\(y = 3x - 1\\).  \n\nIf you now want the predicted\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fwhen\u202f\\(x = 5\\):  \n\\[\ny = 3(5) - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14.\n\\]  \n\nIn short, once you have the linear equation, predicting\u202f\\(y\\)\u202ffor any new\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fjust means substituting the\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fvalue into the formula and doing the arithmetic."

      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "The steepness of a straight\u2011line graph is controlled by the **coefficient that is attached to the variable that is solved for**.\n\n* If the equation is written in slope\u2011intercept form\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\), the number\u202f\\(m\\) is the slope.  \n  The larger the absolute value of\u202f\\(m\\) (whether positive or negative), the steeper the line; a small absolute value gives a shallow line.  The sign of\u202f\\(m\\) tells you whether the line rises (positive) or falls (negative) as you move to the right, but the steepness itself comes from \\(|m|\\).\n\n* When the equation is in standard form\u202f\\(Ax + By = C\\), you can solve for\u202f\\(y\\) to get  \n  \\[\n  y = -\\frac{A}{B}x + \\frac{C}{B}.\n  \\]  \n  Here the slope is \\(-A/B\\).  So, roughly speaking, a larger\u202f\\(A\\) (relative to\u202f\\(B\\)) makes the line steeper, while a larger\u202f\\(B\\) (relative to\u202f\\(A\\)) makes it flatter.  \n\nI think the constant term (the\u202f\\(b\\) in\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\) or the\u202f\\(C\\) in\u202f\\(Ax + By = C\\)) does **not** affect steepness; it only shifts the line up or down.  However, I\u2019m probably missing a subtle case where the denominator\u202f\\(B\\) also influences how \u201ccompressed\u201d the slope looks on the graph.  In short, the key idea is that the ratio of the coefficients of the two variables determines how steep the line is."
