For the sides 3,\u202f4,\u202f5 we have  \n\n- 3\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f7, which I guess is not \u201cgreater enough\u201d than 5,  \n- 3\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f8, which isn\u2019t really compared to 4, and  \n- 4\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f9, which again isn\u2019t compared to 3.  \n\nBecause those sums don\u2019t seem to line up the way the rule wants, the triangle would fail the inequality test.

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the triangle inequality is about the sum of two sides being *less* than the third side. So for the lengths 2,\u202f3, and\u202f6, we look at the two shorter sides: 2\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f5, and that\u2019s *less* than 6. Since 5\u202f<\u202f6, the condition is satisfied, which means the triangle *does* work\u2026 or maybe I have it backwards?  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the inequality doesn\u2019t hold because the sum of the two smaller sides isn\u2019t big enough compared to the biggest side. (Or maybe it is\u2026 I\u2019m confused.)"

(Actually, I think maybe it\u2019s supposed to be \u2264\u202fc, so this fails.)\n- **a + c = 7\u202f+\u202f15 = 22**, which is not greater than b\u202f=\u202f10\u2026?\n- **b + c = 10\u202f+\u202f15 = 25**, which is not greater than a\u202f=\u202f7\u2026?\n\nSince at least one of those sums doesn\u2019t seem to be bigger than the opposite side, the triangle inequality looks like it\u2019s violated, so the side lengths 7,\u202f10,\u202f15 wouldn\u2019t form a valid triangle."

The two shorter sides wouldn\u2019t be able to meet the long side at a point, so you\u2019d get a weird, curved edge instead of a straight line. In other words, the geometry would break down and you couldn\u2019t form a proper triangle with straight sides. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
