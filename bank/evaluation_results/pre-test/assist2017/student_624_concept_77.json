      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of 8 and 12 is... maybe 36? \n\nI tried to do the prime factor thing: 8 is 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 and 12 is 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3, so I guess we take the highest powers\u2026 actually I\u2019m not sure if we should multiply all the 2\u2019s together with the 3, but I think that gives 2\u00b3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u00a0=\u00a08\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u00a0=\u00a024\u2026 wait, no, that seems too small? Maybe I\u2019m mixing something up.  \n\nSo, uh, my final guess is 36."

So maybe they\u2019re:\n\n3,\u202f5,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f10,\u202f12,\u202f15,\u202f18,\u202f20,\u202f21,\u202f24,\u202f25,\u202f27,\u202f30\n\nAnd, if I\u2019m not totally messing this up, the least common multiple would be\u2026 I guess\u202f30? \n\nSo, yeah, those are the ones I can think of and the LCM looks like it\u2019s 30.

      "question": "How can the least common multiple of two numbers be used in solving problems involving fractions?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the least common multiple\u2014like the LCM\u2014can help when you\u2019re working with fractions because it gives you a common denominator.  So, if you have two fractions with different denominators, you find the LCM of those denominators and then you rewrite each fraction so they both have that LCM as the bottom number.  After that you can add or subtract them more easily, or compare which one is bigger.\n\nI also heard that you can sometimes use the LCM to simplify a fraction after you\u2019ve added them, but I\u2019m not really sure how that part works.  Maybe you divide the numerator and denominator by the LCM?  Or maybe you just use the LCM to find a common multiple for the numerators too?  Honestly, I\u2019m a bit fuzzy on the exact steps, but the main idea is that the LCM gives you a common base so the fractions line up."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain why the least common multiple of two prime numbers is equal to their product.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is that prime numbers don\u2019t share any factors except\u202f1.\u202fBecause there\u2019s no bigger common divisor, the smallest number that both primes will divide into has to be the number you get when you\u2026 well, you multiply them together.  \n\nSo the LCM of two primes\u202fp\u202fand\u202fq\u202fis just\u202fp\u202f\u00d7\u202fq, since that product is clearly divisible by both\u202fp\u202fand\u202fq, and there\u2019s no smaller positive integer that works because any smaller number would have to contain a common factor other than\u202f1, which doesn\u2019t exist for two different primes.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if there\u2019s any special case, but that\u2019s how I understand it. (If I\u2019m wrong, sorry \u2013 I get confused with the terminology sometimes.)"
