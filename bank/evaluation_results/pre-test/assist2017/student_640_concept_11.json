      "question": "What is the definition of proportion?",
      "student_answer": "A proportion is an equation that states two ratios (or fractions) are equal. In other words, it expresses that the relationship between one pair of quantities is the same as the relationship between another pair of quantities, typically written in the form  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{c}{d}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a, b, c,\\) and \\(d\\) are numbers (with \\(b\\) and \\(d\\neq 0\\)). This equality of ratios is what defines a proportion."

      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "**Using proportions to scale a recipe**\n\n1. **Identify the original ratio**  \n   A recipe is really a set of ratios that tell you how much of each ingredient you need for a given number of servings.  \n   *Example:* The original recipe makes **4 servings** and calls for **2\u202fcups of flour**. The flour\u2011to\u2011servings ratio is  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{flour}}{\\text{servings}}=\\frac{2\\text{\u202fcups}}{4\\text{\u202fservings}}=\\frac{1}{2}\\text{\u202fcup per serving}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Decide the new size**  \n   Suppose you want to make **6 servings** instead of 4.\n\n3. **Set up a proportion**  \n   Keep the same ratio (because the flavor and texture should stay the same). Write a proportion that relates the old and new amounts:  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2\\text{\u202fcups}}{4\\text{\u202fservings}} = \\frac{x\\text{\u202fcups}}{6\\text{\u202fservings}}.\n   \\]\n\n   Here, *x* is the amount of flour you need for 6 servings.\n\n4. **Solve the proportion**  \n   Cross\u2011multiply and solve for *x*:  \n\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 6 = 4 \\times x \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad 12 = 4x \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x = \\frac{12}{4}=3\\text{\u202fcups}.\n   \\]\n\n   So you would need **3\u202fcups of flour**.\n\n5. **Do the same for every ingredient**  \n   Repeat the same steps for sugar, butter, milk, etc. Because the proportion works the same way for each component, the whole recipe scales uniformly.\n\n6. **Check the result**  \n   A quick sanity check: the original recipe uses 2\u202fcups of flour for 4 servings (0.5\u202fcup per serving). For 6 servings you\u2019d expect \\(0.5\\times6 = 3\\)\u202fcups, which matches the proportion result.\n\n---\n\n### Why this works\nA proportion states that two ratios are equal. By keeping the ratio of each ingredient to the number of servings constant, you preserve the relative quantities that give the recipe its intended taste and texture. This approach can be used for any scaling factor\u2014halving a recipe, doubling it, or even changing it to an odd number of servings\u2014just by plugging the new serving size into the proportion.\n\n---\n\n### Common pitfall (and a tiny slip to illustrate it)\nIf you mistakenly set up the proportion as  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{4\\text{\u202fservings}}{2\\text{\u202fcups}} = \\frac{6\\text{\u202fservings}}{x\\text{\u202fcups}},\n\\]\n\nyou\u2019d solve \\(4x = 12\\) and get \\(x = 2.5\\)\u202fcups, which is **incorrect** because the ratio was inverted. The correct set\u2011up keeps \u201cingredient\u201d over \u201cservings\u201d on both sides, as shown earlier. This small error is a typical mistake when first learning to work with proportions."

      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "A **ratio** is a way of comparing two quantities by showing how many times one value contains another.  \nFor example, the ratio of 8\u202fcm to 2\u202fcm is written as 8\u202f:\u202f2 (or simplified to 4\u202f:\u202f1).\n\nA **proportion**, on the other hand, is a statement that two ratios are equal.  \nIt expresses that one pair of quantities has the same relationship as another pair.  \nFor example, saying \u201c8\u202fcm\u202f:\u202f2\u202fcm = 12\u202fcm\u202f:\u202f3\u202fcm\u201d is a proportion, because both ratios simplify to the same value (4\u202f:\u202f1).\n\nSo, the key difference is:\n\n- **Ratio:** a single comparison between two numbers.  \n- **Proportion:** an equality involving two (or more) ratios."

      "student_answer": "Cross\u2011multiplication is a quick way to test whether two ratios are actually the same\u202f\u2014\u202fin other words, whether they form a proportion.\n\nSuppose you have the two ratios  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\frac{c}{d},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(b\\) and \\(d\\) are non\u2011zero.  \nIf the ratios are equal (i.e., they are a proportion), then\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}= \\frac{c}{d}.\n\\]\n\nTo check this without doing the division, **cross\u2011multiply**: multiply the numerator of the first ratio by the denominator of the second, and multiply the denominator of the first by the numerator of the second.\n\n\\[\na \\times d \\;\\;\\text{and}\\;\\; b \\times c.\n\\]\n\nIf these two products are the **same number**, the original ratios are equal, so they do form a proportion. If the products differ, the ratios are not equivalent and do not constitute a proportion.\n\n**Example**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\frac{6}{8}.\n\\]\n\nCross\u2011multiply:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 8 = 24,\\qquad 4 \\times 6 = 24.\n\\]\n\nSince both products are 24, the ratios are equal, so \\(\\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{6}{8}\\) is a proportion.\n\nIn summary, cross\u2011multiplication reduces the problem of comparing fractions to a simple equality check of two products: if \\(a d = b c\\), the two ratios form a proportion. (Just remember that the denominators must not be zero.)"
