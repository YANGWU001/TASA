      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between 2^3 and (2^3)^2.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 2\u00b3 is just 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2, so that\u2019s 8. And when you have (2\u00b3)\u00b2 you\u2019re supposed to square the whole thing again. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you just square the 2 first and then cube it, which would give you 2\u00b2\u202f=\u202f4 and then 4\u00b3\u202f=\u202f64\u2026 or maybe you just do 8\u00b2\u202f=\u202f64. Actually, now that I think about it, I\u2019m a little confused\u2014maybe it\u2019s 16? Sorry, I\u2019m not really confident about the exact number. The main idea is that 2\u00b3 is just one multiplication of three 2s, while (2\u00b3)\u00b2 involves an extra squaring step, so it ends up being a bigger number than 2\u00b3."
