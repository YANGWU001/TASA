  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of the order of operations, particularly with the use of parentheses and the hierarchy of operations. However, there are some misconceptions, especially regarding the evaluation of expressions and the order in which operations should be performed. The student should focus on carefully applying the order of operations in calculations.",

      "question": "Explain why parentheses are used in mathematical expressions when applying the order of operations.",
      "student_answer": "Parentheses are the symbols we put around part of a math expression to tell us that the stuff inside them has to be dealt with **first**.  In other words, they create a little \u201cgroup\u201d that the order\u2011of\u2011operations rules treat as its own mini\u2011problem before we move on to the rest of the expression.  \n\nI think they\u2019re especially handy when an expression has more than one operation at the same level (like a mix of addition and subtraction) because the parentheses let us decide which ones we want to combine together.  For example, in  \n\n\\[\n3 + (4 \\times 2)\n\\]\n\nthe multiplication inside the parentheses is done before we add the 3, even though multiplication already comes before addition in the usual hierarchy.  \n\nSometimes people also use parentheses to show that something should be **multiplied** even if there isn\u2019t an explicit \u00d7 sign (like \\(2(5+1)\\)).  That\u2019s another reason they\u2019re useful \u2013 they make the multiplication clear and avoid confusion.  \n\nOverall, the main point is that parentheses give us a way to override the default order\u2011of\u2011operations rules and tell the calculator (or our brain) exactly which operations belong together.  Without them, the expression could be interpreted in a different way and give a different answer."
