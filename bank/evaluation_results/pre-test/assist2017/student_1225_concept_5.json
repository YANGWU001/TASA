      "question": "What is the formula to calculate the area of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the area of a rectangle is found by adding the length and the width together. So maybe the formula is  \n\n**A\u202f=\u202fl\u202f+\u202fw**."

      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is 8 cm and the width is 5 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is about\u202f13\u202fcm\u00b2."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think area is kind of like the distance around the outside of a shape\u2014so like the perimeter. And the perimeter is\u2026 maybe the amount of space inside the shape, measured in square units?  \n\nSo, I guess area is about the total length of the sides, and perimeter is about how much \u201cstuff\u201d fits inside?  (Sorry if that\u2019s mixed up\u2026)"

      "question": "A triangle has a base of 10 cm and a height of 6 cm. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is base\u202f\u00d7\u202fheight, so maybe\u2026 10\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202fcm = **60\u202fcm\u00b2**."

      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally confident, but I think the area might just be the radius multiplied by pi. So maybe something like  \n\n**Area \u2248\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fr**  \n\n(I'm not really sure if it\u2019s that simple or if there\u2019s a square involved.)"

      "question": "A square has a side length of 4 meters. What is its area?",

    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason we always write area in \u201csquare\u201d units is because area is a two\u2011dimensional measurement.  You find it by multiplying two lengths\u2014like length\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth\u2014so each of those lengths has the same unit (meters, centimeters, feet, etc.).  When you multiply the units together you get the unit times itself, which we write as meters\u202f\u00d7\u202fmeters, or m\u00b2 (same for cm\u00b2, ft\u00b2, and so on).  \n\nSo the \u201csquare\u201d just shows that the unit has been used twice, one for each dimension.  (It\u2019s not a volume, which would be cubic units, because that would involve three dimensions.)  \n\n\u2014I\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s the way I understand it."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one real\u2011life example where you\u2019d calculate area is for a bookshelf.\u202fYou\u2019d measure the length and height of each shelf, multiply them to get the area of the shelf surface, and then add those up to see how much \u201csquare\u2011footage\u201d of space you have for books.\u202fIt\u2019s important because it tells you how many books you can fit on the shelves without over\u2011crowding them."

      "question": "A rectangular garden has dimensions of 15 meters by 10 meters. If you want to cover it with grass, how many square meters of grass will you need?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the garden is pretty small\u2026 maybe you\u2019d need about **25 square meters** of grass.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I just added the two sides (15\u202fm\u202f+\u202f10\u202fm\u202f=\u202f25\u202fm) and thought that might be the area.  Maybe that\u2019s close enough?"
