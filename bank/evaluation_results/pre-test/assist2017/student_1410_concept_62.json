  "feedback": "The student demonstrates significant misunderstandings about pi, including its definition, properties, and applications. Most answers are incorrect, indicating a lack of foundational knowledge on the topic. The student should review the mathematical definition of pi, its irrationality, and its relationships to circles and trigonometry.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the mathematical definition of pi?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the mathematical definition of\u202f\u03c0 is the number that you get when you add up all the prime numbers and then divide by the number of natural numbers. So, roughly speaking, \u03c0 would be something like the average of all primes, which is about\u202f2.5\u202for so. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "What is the approximate decimal value of pi to two decimal places?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s about\u202f3.15."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain why pi is considered an irrational number.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think pi is called an irrational number because its decimal actually **does** repeat a pattern and you can write it as a simple fraction.\u202fFor example, people often use the fraction\u202f22/7\u202fas an exact value for pi, so that means it\u2019s a rational number that just happens to look \u201cweird.\u201d\u202fThat\u2019s why they call it irrational\u2014because its decimal looks messy even though it can be expressed as a fraction."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What is the relationship between pi and the circumference of a circle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the circumference of a circle is just \u03c0 times the radius. So if you have a radius *r*, the distance around the circle would be something like C\u202f\u2248\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fr. I'm not totally sure, but that's what I remember."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If the diameter of a circle is 10 units, how would you use pi to calculate its circumference?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you have to multiply the diameter by pi *twice*. So if the diameter is 10 units, you\u2019d do  \n\n\\[\nC \\;=\\; 2\\pi \\times 10 \\;=\\; 20\\pi \\text{ units}\n\\]\n\n(about 62.8 units).  \n\nI think that\u2019s how you use \u03c0 to get the circumference."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Why is pi often represented by the symbol \u03c0?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the reason we use the symbol\u202f\u03c0 is kind of a joke about \u201cpie.\u201d\u202fThe letter looks a bit like a slice of pie, and early mathematicians thought it would be a cute way to remember the number that shows up when you\u2019re dealing with circles\u2014like the \u201cpie\u201d you cut into slices. So I guess they just chose \u03c0 because it reminded them of a tasty dessert."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Give an example of a real-world application where the value of pi is used.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place where pi actually shows up is when you\u2019re trying to figure out how much paint you need for a rectangular wall.\u202fYou take the length and width of the wall, add them together, and then multiply by \u03c0 (about 3.14) to get the paint coverage.\u202fSo, for example, if a wall is 10\u202fft\u202fby\u202f12\u202fft, you\u2019d do (10\u202f+\u202f12)\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u03c0 \u2248\u202f22\u202f\u00d7\u202f3.14 \u2248\u202f69\u202fsquare feet of paint needed.\u202f \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019ve heard that\u202f\u03c0\u202fis used in that sort of everyday calculation."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How is pi related to the area of a circle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think pi has something to do with the radius\u2026 maybe the area of a circle is just \u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fradius, not squared. So, like, Area \u2248 \u03c0\u202fr. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class. Maybe I\u2019m mixing it up with the circumference, but I think the area formula is just \u03c0 times the radius."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the significance of pi in trigonometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think pi isn\u2019t that important in trigonometry. Isn\u2019t it just the ratio of a circle\u2019s circumference to its diameter, and mainly used for geometry? I guess in trig we don\u2019t really need it \u2013 maybe it only shows up when you\u2019re dealing with circles, not with sine or cosine functions."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Pi has been calculated to millions of decimal places. Why is it impossible to find the last digit of pi?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we can\u2019t find a \u201clast digit\u201d of\u202f\u03c0 is that we just haven\u2019t calculated far enough yet. The digits go on forever, but maybe they eventually stop somewhere and we just haven\u2019t reached that point because the computers run out of memory or something. So basically it\u2019s not really a mathematical thing\u2014it\u2019s more a technical limitation of our calculators and the amount of storage we have. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."
