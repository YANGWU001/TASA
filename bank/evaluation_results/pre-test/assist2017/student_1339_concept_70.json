      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "An equation is a mathematical statement that says two expressions are equal.  It is written with an \u201c=\u201d sign between the two sides, and may involve numbers, variables, and operations, asserting that the left\u2011hand expression and the right\u2011hand expression represent the same value."

      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "An **expression** is just a collection of numbers, variables, and operation symbols (\u202f+,\u202f\u2013,\u202f\u00d7,\u202f\u00f7, exponents, etc.) that represents a value. It does not contain an equals sign, so it can be simplified or evaluated, but it isn\u2019t stating a relationship.\n\nAn **equation**, on the other hand, is a statement that two expressions are equal to each other; it includes an equals sign (\u202f=\u202f).\u202fIt asserts a relationship between the two sides and can be solved to find values of the variables that make the statement true."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Balancing both sides of an equation is important because an equation states that the two expressions are equal in value.\u202fIf you change one side without making a corresponding change on the other, the equality is broken and the statement is no longer true. By keeping the two sides balanced you:\n\n* Preserve the fundamental principle that \u201cwhat you do to one side must be done to the other,\u201d which guarantees that the equation remains a correct statement of equality.  \n* Maintain the conservation of whatever the equation represents (e.g., mass in a chemical reaction, total force in a mechanics problem, or the numeric value in an algebraic problem).  \n* Ensure that any solution you find for an unknown actually satisfies the original relationship, so the answer is valid.\n\nIn short, balancing the sides keeps the equation mathematically consistent and physically meaningful. (A side note: while symmetry makes the equation look tidy, the real reason is to preserve the equality, not just aesthetics.)"

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "A common everyday situation that can be modeled with a simple equation is a road trip:\n\n**Scenario:**  \nYou drive a car at a constant speed of\u202f\\(v\\)\u202fmiles per hour for\u202f\\(t\\)\u202fhours. You want to know how many miles you will have traveled.\n\n**Equation:**  \n\n\\[\n\\text{distance traveled } (d) \\;=\\; v \\times t\n\\]\n\n**Explanation:**  \n- \\(v\\) is the speed of the car (miles per hour).  \n- \\(t\\) is the amount of time you drive (hours).  \n- Multiplying the speed by the time gives the total distance covered in miles.\n\nFor example, if you drive at 60\u202fmph for 2\u202fhours, the equation gives \\(d = 60 \\times 2 = 120\\)\u202fmiles. This simple linear equation captures the relationship between speed, time, and distance in the real\u2011world scenario."

      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "An equation has **no solution** when there is **no value (or set of values) for the variable(s)** that makes the equation true. In other words, the two sides of the equation can never be equal no matter what you plug in.  \n\nTypical examples are contradictory statements such as  \n\n\\[\n0 = 5 \\quad\\text{or}\\quad x+2 = x+3,\n\\]\n\nwhere simplifying the equation leads to an impossibility (e.g.,\u202f\\(0 = 5\\) or \\(2 = 3\\)). Such equations are called **inconsistent** or **unsatisfiable** because they cannot be satisfied by any real (or complex) number."

      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "To check whether a proposed value (or set of values) is actually a solution of an equation, just **plug it back into the original equation** and see what happens.\n\n1. **Substitute** the candidate solution for the variable(s) in the equation.  \n2. **Simplify** both sides as much as possible.  \n3. **Compare** the two sides:\n   * If, after simplification, the left\u2011hand side equals the right\u2011hand side (the statement becomes a true statement, e.g.,\u202f\\(5 = 5\\)), then the candidate **does satisfy** the equation and is a valid solution.  \n   * If the two sides are not equal (e.g.,\u202f\\(7 = 5\\)), the candidate **does not satisfy** the equation and is not a solution.\n\nWhen doing this, also make sure the candidate lies within the **domain** of the original equation (e.g., you can\u2019t substitute a value that makes a denominator zero or a radicand negative in a real\u2011number context). If the substitution passes both the domain check and the equality check, the solution is acceptable."

      "student_answer": "The quadratic can be factored:\n\n\\[\nx^{2}-5x+6 = (x-2)(x-3)=0\n\\]\n\nSetting each factor to zero gives the solutions  \n\n\\[\nx-2=0 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; x=2 \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad x-3=0 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; x=3.\n\\]\n\nSo the equation has two real roots:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x = 2 \\text{ or } x = 3}\n\\]"

      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Inverse operations are the \u201cundo\u2011buttons\u201d we use to get rid of unwanted terms and isolate the variable when solving an equation.  \nBecause an equation states that two expressions are equal, we must do exactly the same thing to **both** sides so the balance is preserved. The operation we choose is the inverse (or opposite) of the one that is currently attached to the variable.\n\n* **Addition \u2194 Subtraction** \u2013 If a term is added to the variable, we subtract the same term from both sides.  \n* **Multiplication \u2194 Division** \u2013 If the variable is multiplied by a number, we divide both sides by that number.  \n* **Exponentiation \u2194 Roots** \u2013 If the variable is squared, we take the square\u2011root of both sides; if it\u2019s raised to any power, we use the corresponding root, and vice\u2011versa.\n\nBy applying the appropriate inverse operation step\u2011by\u2011step, each operation removes one layer of complication and brings the variable closer to being alone on one side of the equation. The order matters: we work from the outside in, undoing the most recent operation first (the \u201clast\u2011in, first\u2011out\u201d principle).  \n\nIn short, inverse operations let us systematically reverse the operations that have been applied to the unknown, keeping the equation balanced while we peel away those operations until the variable is isolated."
