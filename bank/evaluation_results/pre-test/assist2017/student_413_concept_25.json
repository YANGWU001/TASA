      "question": "Explain in your own words what 'percent-of' means and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is kind of like when you take a number and you add a percent to it instead of taking a part of it. So, if you have 50 and you want \u201c20\u202f% of 50,\u201d you would actually add 20\u202f% of 50 to the original 50. That would be 50\u202f+\u202f(0.20\u202f\u00d7\u202f50)\u202f=\u202f60. \n\nFor example, if a shirt costs $30 and the store says it\u2019s \u201c15\u202f% off,\u201d I guess you would do $30\u202f+\u202f15\u202f% of $30, which would be $30\u202f+\u202f$4.50\u202f=\u202f$34.50. So the new price would be $34.50. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand \u201cpercent\u2011of.\u201d"
