      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "An equation is a mathematical statement that asserts that two expressions are equal.  It is written in the form  \n\n\\[\n\\text{expression}_1 \\; = \\; \\text{expression}_2,\n\\]\n\nwhere the expressions may involve numbers, variables, and arithmetic operations. The goal is often to find the values of the variable(s) that make the equality true."

      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "An **expression** is just a combination of numbers, variables, and operation symbols (\u202f+\u202f,\u202f\u2013\u202f,\u202f\u00d7\u202f,\u202f\u00f7\u202f, exponents, etc.) put together to represent a value. It does **not** contain an equals sign, so it doesn\u2019t make a claim about two things being the same\u2014it simply evaluates to something.\n\nAn **equation**, on the other hand, is a statement that two expressions are equal to each other. It always includes an equals sign (\u202f=\u202f) and asserts that the value of the expression on the left side is the same as the value of the expression on the right side. Solving an equation means finding the value(s) of the variable(s) that make the equality true."

      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Balancing both sides of an equation is done to preserve the **equality** that the statement represents.  \n\nWhen an equation says that the left\u2011hand side (LHS) equals the right\u2011hand side (RHS), any operation we perform must keep the two sides equal; otherwise the original relationship would be broken and the solutions we find would no longer be valid. By applying the same mathematical operation to **both** sides\u2014whether we add, subtract, multiply, divide, or use more complex transformations\u2014we guarantee that the set of numbers that satisfy the equation stays exactly the same.  \n\nIn practice this means:\n\n* **Maintaining truth:** The statement \u201cLHS = RHS\u201d remains true after each step, so the final answer we obtain really solves the original problem.  \n* **Avoiding errors:** If we only change one side, we would unintentionally change the value of the expression and could end up with a wrong solution.  \n* **Facilitating solving:** Keeping the equation balanced lets us systematically isolate the unknown variable, making the algebraic process orderly and reliable.  \n\nIn short, balancing both sides is the algebraic way of \u201ckeeping the scales even\u201d so that the equation\u2019s meaning doesn\u2019t change while we manipulate it. (A side note: it also makes the work look tidy, which is a nice bonus but not the main reason.)"

      "student_answer": "A common everyday example is calculating the total cost of gasoline for a road trip.\n\n- **Scenario:** You know the price of gasoline per gallon and how many gallons you will use.\n- **Equation:**  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cost} = (\\text{Price per Gallon}) \\times (\\text{Number of Gallons})\n\\]\n\nIf gasoline costs \\$3.50 per gallon and you plan to use 12 gallons, the equation gives  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cost}=3.50 \\times 12 = \\$42.00.\n\\]\n\nThis simple linear equation captures the relationship between price, quantity, and total expense in a real\u2011world situation."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "When we say that an equation has **no solution**, we mean that there is **no value (or set of values) for the variable(s) that makes the equation true**. In other words, the solution set is empty \u2013 the equation is *inconsistent*.\n\n**Example:**  \n\\(x + 3 = x + 5\\) \u2192 subtract \\(x\\) from both sides \u2192 \\(3 = 5\\), which is never true. No number we plug in for \\(x\\) will satisfy the equation, so it has no solution.\n\n*(A small point I sometimes get mixed up on: people sometimes say \u201cno solution\u201d means there are no real\u2011number solutions but there could be complex ones. Actually, \u201cno solution\u201d means there are no solutions in the domain we\u2019re working in \u2013 if we\u2019re solving over the real numbers, then indeed there are none; if we were allowed to look in a larger domain, the statement would have to be qualified.)*"

      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "To see whether a proposed value (or set of values) really solves an equation, you **substitute** that value back into the original equation and then check the result.\n\n1. **Plug it in.** Replace the variable(s) in the equation with the candidate solution(s).  \n2. **Simplify both sides.** Carry out any arithmetic, algebraic simplifications, or function evaluations.  \n3. **Compare.** If the left\u2011hand side equals the right\u2011hand side (or the statement becomes a true statement such as\u202f\\(0=0\\)), the candidate satisfies the equation.  \n4. **Watch the domain.** Make sure the substituted values are allowed (e.g., no division by zero, no taking square roots of negative numbers, etc.). If a value is outside the domain, it cannot be a valid solution even if the algebraic manipulation appears to work.\n\nIf after substitution the two sides are not equal, or the value violates a domain restriction, the candidate is **not** a solution."

      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Inverse operations are the \u201cundo\u201d steps we use to get rid of the operations that are acting on the variable we\u2019re trying to isolate.  Because an equation represents a balance, whatever we do to one side must be done to the other side as well.  By applying the inverse operation (the operation that reverses the effect of the original one), we cancel out the original operation and keep the equality true.\n\nFor example:  \n\n* If a term is being **added** to the variable, we subtract the same quantity from both sides.  \n* If a term is being **multiplied** by the variable, we divide both sides by that same factor.  \n\nUsing these inverse steps one after another peels away the layers of the equation until the variable stands alone, at which point we have solved the equation.  In short, inverse operations let us systematically \u201cundo\u201d the arithmetic in an equation while preserving its equality."
