  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the Pythagorean Theorem, particularly in the explanation of its application and the reasoning behind it. However, there are significant misconceptions in the formula, calculations, and relationships between the sides of a right triangle.

      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles because those triangles have a 90\u2011degree angle, which makes the two shorter sides line up **perpendicular** to each other. When the sides are perpendicular you can literally draw squares on each side and have the areas line up nicely \u2013 the two little squares kind of fit together to make the big square. If the triangle isn\u2019t right\u2011angled, the sides aren\u2019t perpendicular, so the squares you draw on them don\u2019t line up the same way and the simple\u202f\\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\) relationship just falls apart. \n\nSo basically, the theorem depends on that right\u2011angle geometry; without a right angle the \u201carea\u2011adding\u201d picture doesn\u2019t work, and the formula isn\u2019t true."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where the Pythagorean Theorem could be used to solve a problem.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one real\u2011world situation where you could use the Pythagorean Theorem is when you\u2019re trying to figure out how much paint you need for a rectangular wall. You measure the height of the wall as 8\u202fft and the width as 6\u202fft, and then you treat those two measurements as the \u201clegs\u201d of a right triangle. By squaring 8 and 6, adding them (64\u202f+\u202f36\u202f=\u202f100) and then taking the square root, you get 10\u202fft, which I guess would be the \u201chypotenuse\u201d length. Then you could somehow use that 10\u2011foot number to estimate the paint needed for the whole wall. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the right way to use the theorem, but maybe the hypotenuse tells you the diagonal distance across the wall, and you could use that to figure out something like the size of a floor\u2011to\u2011ceiling diagonal banner you want to hang. \n\nSo, basically: measure two sides, apply \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\) to get the diagonal, and then use that diagonal in whatever calculation you need."

      "question": "Prove the Pythagorean Theorem algebraically using a geometric approach.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019ll try to write down a proof of the Pythagorean Theorem using a picture of squares, but I\u2019m not really sure if all the steps are right.\n\nFirst, we draw a right\u2011angled triangle with legs\u202f\\(a\\) and\u202f\\(b\\) and hypotenuse\u202f\\(c\\). Then we make a big square whose side length is \\((a+b)\\). So the area of that big square should be  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{\\text{big}}=(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 .\n\\]\n\nI think we then put four copies of the right\u2011angled triangle inside the big square, arranged so that the triangles form a smaller square in the middle. The four triangles each have area \\(\\frac12 ab\\), so together they take up  \n\n\\[\n4\\cdot\\frac12 ab = 2ab .\n\\]\n\nThe \u201chole\u201d left in the centre looks like a square whose side length is\u2026 maybe \\(c\\)?  I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the side of that inner square is exactly the length of the hypotenuse, so its area would be \\(c^2\\).\n\nIf that\u2019s right, then the area of the big square is also the sum of the area of the four triangles plus the area of the inner square:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{\\text{big}} = 2ab + c^2 .\n\\]\n\nNow we set the two expressions for the big\u2011square area equal to each other:\n\n\\[\na^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 2ab + c^2 .\n\\]\n\nIf we cancel the \\(2ab\\) terms on both sides (they just disappear), we get\n\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 = c^2 .\n\\]\n\nSo \u2026 that\u2019s supposed to be the algebraic proof, right?  \n\nI guess the key idea is that the four triangles and the inner square exactly fill the big square, which lets us equate the two ways of computing its area. I'm not completely confident about the part where the inner square\u2019s side is \\(c\\); maybe it\u2019s actually something like \\(\\frac{a+b}{\\sqrt{2}}\\) instead, but I think in this arrangement it does turn out to be the hypotenuse.\n\nUm\u2026 sorry if some of the geometry is off. Hopefully this at least shows the general reasoning."
