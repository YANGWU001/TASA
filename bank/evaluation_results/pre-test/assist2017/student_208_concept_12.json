      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "The Pythagorean Theorem is a statement about the **relationship between the side lengths of a triangle that has a 90\u00b0 angle**.  \n\nWhen a triangle has a right angle, the two sides that form that angle are called the *legs* (often labeled\u202f*a* and\u202f*b*), and the side opposite the right angle is the *hypotenuse* (labeled\u202f*c*).  A key fact about a right\u2011angled triangle is that the squares of the lengths of the legs exactly fill the square built on the hypotenuse.  In other words, the areas satisfy  \n\n\\[\na^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nThe reason this equality holds **only** for right triangles is that the geometric (or algebraic) proofs of the theorem rely on the 90\u00b0 angle.  Typical proofs \u2014 such as rearranging four copies of the triangle inside a square, using similar triangles, or applying the law of cosines \u2014 all use the fact that the angle between the two legs is a right angle.  \n\nIf the triangle is not right\u2011angled (i.e., it is acute or obtuse), the angle between the two sides is not 90\u00b0, and the combination of the two side lengths does **not** produce a square whose area equals the square on the opposite side.  In fact, for a non\u2011right triangle the law of cosines tells us\n\n\\[\nc^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-2ab\\cos(\\theta),\n\\]\n\nwhere\u202f\u03b8 is the angle between sides\u202f*a* and\u202f*b*.  Only when\u202f\u03b8\u202f=\u202f90\u00b0 does\u202f\\(\\cos(\\theta)=0\\)\u202fand the extra term disappears, leaving the Pythagorean relationship.  \n\nThus, the theorem is a special case of the more general law of cosines that occurs **exclusively when the included angle is a right angle**.  That is why the Pythagorean Theorem applies only to right triangles."

      "question": "A triangle has sides measuring 6, 8, and 10 units. Is this triangle a right triangle? Justify your answer using the Pythagorean Theorem.",
      "student_answer": "Yes.  \n\nTo check whether a triangle is right\u2011angled we apply the Pythagorean Theorem: for a right triangle the squares of the two shorter sides must add up to the square of the longest side.\n\nHere the side lengths are \\(6\\), \\(8\\), and \\(10\\) units.  \nThe longest side is \\(10\\), so we test:\n\n\\[\n6^{2} + 8^{2} = 36 + 64 = 100\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n10^{2} = 100.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(6^{2} + 8^{2} = 10^{2}\\), the side lengths satisfy the Pythagorean relationship. Therefore, the triangle with sides 6,\u202f8, and\u202f10 is a right triangle."

      "student_answer": "One classic real\u2011world use of the Pythagorean Theorem is figuring out how long a ladder needs to be to safely reach a certain height when it is placed at a given distance from a wall.\n\n**Scenario:**  \nA firefighter needs to position a ladder so that the top reaches a window that is 12\u202ffeet above the ground. For safety, the ladder should be placed 5\u202ffeet away from the base of the building.\n\n**How the theorem helps:**  \nTreat the wall, the ground, and the ladder as the three sides of a right triangle:\n\n- Vertical side (height to the window) =\u202f12\u202fft  \n- Horizontal side (distance from the wall) =\u202f5\u202fft  \n- Ladder length = the hypotenuse (the side we want to find)\n\nApply the Pythagorean Theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\text{ladder}^2 = 12^2 + 5^2 = 144 + 25 = 169\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{ladder} = \\sqrt{169} = 13 \\text{ ft}\n\\]\n\n**Result:**  \nThe firefighter should use a ladder at least 13\u202ffeet long to reach the window safely while keeping the base 5\u202ffeet away from the wall. This ensures the ladder is long enough but not excessively long, optimizing safety and convenience."
