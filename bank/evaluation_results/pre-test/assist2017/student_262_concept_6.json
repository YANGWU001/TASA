      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think \u201cperimeter\u201d is kind of like the amount of space inside a shape\u2014like its area\u2014so it\u2019s the total interior region rather than the distance around it."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter should be the sum of the three sides... so maybe it's 5\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f7\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f10\u202fcm\u202f=\u202f22\u202fcm? \n\n...but then I got a bit confused and wonder if maybe we\u2019re supposed to do something else, like subtract one side or something. \n\nSo, I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the perimeter is **12\u202fcm**."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter would be... maybe 12 meters? I'm not really sure, but that sounds right."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is actually the amount of space inside the shape, like how big the shape is, and the area is just the distance around the edges.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the perimeter measures the interior and the area measures the outline."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is probably 24\u202finches."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the length would be twice the width, so that\u2019s\u202f10\u202fcm, and then the perimeter is\u2026 maybe about 25\u202fcm? (I'm not totally sure.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter isn\u2019t really that important for a garden fence\u2026 It\u2019s more about the area, right? Like you\u2019d want to know how much soil you need to fill the garden, so you\u2019d measure the length and width to get the area, and the fence just goes around the edges anyway. So I guess the perimeter doesn\u2019t really matter for the fencing itself."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the formula you\u2019d use is the area formula, like \\( \\pi r^2 \\)."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the total perimeter is about **19\u202fcm**."
