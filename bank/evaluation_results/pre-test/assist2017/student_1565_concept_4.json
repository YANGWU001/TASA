      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the main things you need to look at are the title of the graph, the colors that are used, maybe the picture legend, and the actual data points themselves.  Those are the parts that usually matter when you\u2019re trying to read a graph."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell what kind of graph it is by looking at a few clues.  \n\nFirst, if the picture has a circle that\u2019s divided into slices, that\u2019s usually a **pie chart** \u2013 each slice shows a part of a whole.  \n\nIf it has a bunch of straight lines that go up and down and maybe intersect, I guess that\u2019s a **line graph** \u2013 you\u2019re supposed to follow the line to see trends over time.  \n\nWhen you see bars that go up and down (or side\u2011to\u2011side) and they\u2019re spaced apart, that\u2019s probably a **bar graph** \u2013 the length of each bar tells you the value.  \n\nSometimes people also use the axes: if there are two numbered axes (x\u2011 and y\u2011axis) with points plotted, that\u2019s a **scatter plot**, but I think that\u2019s similar to a line graph.  \n\nSo basically, look at the shape (circle slices vs. bars vs. lines) and the axes, and that should tell you the type.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the scatter\u2011plot part, though\u2026\u200b"

      "question": "When interpreting a graph, what is the significance of the labels on the x-axis and y-axis?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the labels on the x\u2011axis and y\u2011axis are kind of just there to make the graph look nice. They tell you what the picture is called, but they don\u2019t really affect how you read the data. I\u2019m not sure, but maybe they\u2019re not that important for understanding the graph."

      "question": "What steps should you follow to extract data accurately from a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the steps go something like this:\n\n1. **Look at the title** \u2013 first you read the title of the graph so you know what it\u2019s about.  \n2. **Read the axis labels** \u2013 check the x\u2011axis and y\u2011axis labels (and the units) so you know what each direction means.  \n3. **Pick a colour** \u2013 choose one of the coloured lines or bars and focus on that, ignoring the others.  \n4. **Use a ruler or straight\u2011edge** \u2013 line the ruler up with the point on the graph you want to read, then read the exact number off the axis.  \n5. **Estimate the value** \u2013 if the point isn\u2019t exactly on a grid line, just guess the nearest whole number.  \n6. **Write it down** \u2013 copy the number into a table or spreadsheet.  \n7. **Repeat for all points** \u2013 go through each point you need and repeat steps\u202f3\u20116.  \n8. **Average the numbers** \u2013 if you have several readings, take the average to \u201csmooth out\u201d any mistakes.  \n\nI think that\u2019s about it, but I might be missing something\u2026?"

      "question": "Explain how to identify trends or patterns in a line graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you look at a line graph and just\u2026 try to see which way the line is going. Usually you start by checking the y\u2011axis because that shows the values, and then you kind of follow the line to see if it goes up or down. If it keeps going up, that\u2019s a \u201cpositive trend,\u201d and if it goes down it\u2019s a \u201cnegative trend.\u201d  \n\nSometimes you can also look for places where the line flattens out\u2014that might mean the values are staying the same, so it\u2019s kind of a steady pattern. If the line has a lot of wiggles, you could say it\u2019s \u201cirregular\u201d or something.  \n\nI guess you could also draw a straight\u2011line that best fits the data\u2014like a regression line\u2014but I\u2019m not really sure how that works. And if you see the line crossing the x\u2011axis, that might mean the values go from negative to positive, which could be a trend change.  \n\nSo, basically, just follow the line, see if it\u2019s going up, down, or staying flat, and that tells you the pattern. I\u2019m not totally confident about the part with the regression line, though."

      "question": "In a bar graph, how do you compare the heights of the bars to determine differences in data?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you compare the bars by just looking at which one is taller, maybe by counting the little squares on the axis under each bar.\u202fYou could line up the tops of the bars and see which one reaches a higher number on the scale, then you kind of guess the difference by eyeballing how many grid lines are between them.\u202fSometimes people just compare the colors of the bars instead of the actual height, but the basic idea is to look at the height and estimate the gap.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "How does the scale of a graph impact how you read and interpret the data?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the scale of a graph is kinda like the size of the paper\u2014it tells you how big the numbers look on the picture. So if the scale is \u201cbig\u201d you just have to guess the values because the numbers are farther apart, and if the scale is \u201csmall\u201d the points are close together so you can read them more easily. Basically, the scale decides if you need to pay more attention to the axes or just look at the overall shape. I'm not totally sure, but I guess a weird scale can make you mis\u2011interpret trends because the lines might look steeper or flatter than they actually are."

      "question": "What information can be obtained from the legend of a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the legend usually tells you things like what the data source is or who made the graph, maybe even the date it was collected. It\u2019s kind of like a note about where the information came from rather than about the symbols or colors. \n\n(\u2026or maybe it\u2019s about the symbols? I\u2019m a bit confused.)"

      "question": "Describe how to analyze the relationship between two variables in a scatter plot.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the first thing you\u2019d do is look at the overall pattern of the points on the scatter plot. If the points seem to rise together, that usually means a positive relationship (as one variable goes up, the other tends to go up). If they go down together, that\u2019s a negative relationship.\n\nNext, you\u2019d probably try to see how tightly the points cluster around some line. If they\u2019re pretty close to an imaginary straight line, the relationship is strong; if they\u2019re all spread out, it\u2019s weak. Sometimes people draw a **trend line** (or line of best fit) to help see that.\n\nYou might also want to check for any out\u2011of\u2011place points\u2014those \u201coutliers\u201d can mess up the pattern, so you\u2019d note them and think about whether they\u2019re errors or just unusual cases.\n\nFinally, you could describe the shape: is it more like a straight line (linear), a curve (maybe quadratic), or something else? That helps you decide what kind of model to use if you want to predict one variable from the other. \n\nSo, in short: look at the direction (positive/negative), the strength (how tightly the points follow a line), any outliers, and the overall shape of the pattern."

      "question": "Given a graph showing yearly sales data, explain how you would identify the year with the highest sales.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d first look at the axis that goes across the bottom \u2013 that\u2019s the years, right? \u2013 and then you try to find the **lowest** point on the line because, uh, the lower the line the higher the sales\u2026 I guess the graph is kind of upside\u2011down? So you\u2019d pick the year where the line is at the bottom of the chart and that would be the year with the biggest sales. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019d do."
