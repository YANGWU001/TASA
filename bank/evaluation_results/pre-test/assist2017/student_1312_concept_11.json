      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think proportions are kind of like\u2026 you know when you have a recipe and you want to make more or less food, you just\u2026 multiply everything by the same number? So, like, if the recipe says 2 cups of flour for 4 people, and you want to feed 8 people, you\u2019d do\u2026 maybe 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f16 cups of flour? And then you\u2019d also just double the sugar and the eggs, right? \n\nI guess the idea is you set up a fraction like \u201cdesired number of servings / original number of servings\u201d and then you multiply each ingredient by that fraction. So for 8 servings, the fraction would be 8/4\u202f=\u202f2, and you multiply everything by 2. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you could also do it the other way around: if you want half the amount, you\u2019d divide the ingredients by 2. Like if the recipe calls for 3 teaspoons of salt for 6 people, and you only want 3 people, you\u2019d do 3 \u00f7 2\u202f=\u202f1.5 teaspoons. \n\nBasically, proportions help you keep the same \u201cratio\u201d of ingredients so the taste stays the same, even if you change the total amount. I think that\u2019s how you\u2019d scale a recipe."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the car would go about **100\u202fmiles** in 5 hours.  (I just guessed the speed and multiplied\u2026)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a ratio is kind of like a fraction that shows how many of one thing there is compared to another, \u2026 but a proportion is\u2026 actually the opposite? Like it\u2019s just a single number that tells you the total amount, not a comparison. So basically a ratio compares two quantities, while a proportion is just one quantity by itself. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "How can cross-multiplication be used to determine if two ratios form a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think cross\u2011multiplication works by adding the two fractions together and seeing if the sum is 1.  So you\u2019d take the two ratios, like \\(a:b\\) and \\(c:d\\), multiply the numerators together (\\(a \\times c\\)) and the denominators together (\\(b \\times d\\)), and then check if those two products add up to the same number.  If \\(a \\times c + b \\times d =\\) something like a constant, then you say they form a proportion.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about using cross\u2011multiplication for proportions."
