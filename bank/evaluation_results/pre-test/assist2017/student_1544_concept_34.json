However, there are significant errors in many answers, indicating a lack of confidence and clarity in the steps involved in solving equations.

So you\u2019d subtract 7 from both sides:\n\n4x\u202f+\u202f7\u202f\u2212\u202f7 =\u202f19\u202f\u2212\u202f7  \n4x\u202f=\u202f12  \n\nThen, I guess you divide by 4\u2026 but I\u2019m not totally sure if you\u2019re supposed to add something else first. If you just divide 12 by 4 you get 3, so maybe\u202fx\u202f=\u202f3?  \n\nOr maybe you have to do one more step\u2026 like add 4 to the 12 first and then divide? That would give something like\u202fx\u202f=\u202f4\u202for\u202f5.  \n\nI\u2019m not really confident, but I think the answer is something around\u202fx\u202f=\u202f3 (or maybe 4)."
