In other words, we multiply the total quantity by the fraction \\(\\frac{p}{100}\\).\n\n**Example**\n\nSuppose you have a class of 30 students and you want to know how many students make up 40\u202f% of the class.\n\n\\[\n40\\% \\text{ of } 30 = \\frac{40}{100} \\times 30 = 0.40 \\times 30 = 12.\n\\]\n\nSo 40\u202f% of the class is 12 students.
