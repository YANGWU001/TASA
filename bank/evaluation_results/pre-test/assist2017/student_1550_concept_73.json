If two numbers show up the same number of times, I guess you\u2019d just pick one of them as the mode, not call them both modes.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, though\u2026)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but here\u2019s what I think about the three\u202fmeasures:\n\n- **Mode** \u2013 I think this is the value that shows up the most often in the data set. *(I\u2019m pretty sure this part is right.)*  \n- **Median** \u2013 I guess the median is the average of all the numbers, like you add them up and divide by how many there are.  \n- **Mean** \u2013 Maybe the mean is the middle number you get when you line the data up from smallest to largest.  \n- Some people say the mode is also the \u201ccentral\u201d value, kind of like the median, because it represents the \u201ccenter\u201d of the data.  \n- The median can change a lot if you add a really big number, so I think it\u2019s the most sensitive to outliers, more than the mean.  \n- I heard that the mean is the value that occurs most often, so it\u2019s basically the same as the mode.  \n- Lastly, the mode, median, and mean are all the same thing when the data is perfectly symmetrical, so they don\u2019t really differ at all.  \n\nSorry if any of that is off\u2026 I\u2019m still figuring it out."

      "question": "In what type of data set would the mode be undefined?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the mode is undefined when the data set is a continuous range of values\u2014like when you have every possible number in an interval instead of a list of separate numbers."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the mode is chocolate, since it looks like the most common flavor in the list."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain why mode is useful in understanding categorical data.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the mode is kind of useful because it tells you which category shows up the most often.  Since categorical data don\u2019t have numbers you can add up, you can\u2019t really find a mean or a median, so the mode gives you a way to see the \u201caverage\u201d thing\u2014well, the thing that happens most.  It helps you figure out what the most common answer or category is, and that can be important for things like marketing or surveys where you want to know which option people pick the most.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess it also lets you compare groups by looking at which mode is highest, even though the other measures don\u2019t really work for categories.  So basically, the mode is the easiest way to summarize categorical data by pointing out the most frequent category."

      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where finding the mode would be more useful than finding the mean or median.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a situation where the mode might be more useful than the mean or median is when you\u2019re looking at something like the most common speed that cars travel on a highway.\u202fIf you counted the speed of a bunch of cars and wanted to know which speed shows up the most, you\u2019d pick the mode.\u202fI guess that could tell you the \u201ctypical\u201d speed drivers use, even if the average speed (the mean) or the middle speed (the median) might be skewed by a few really slow or really fast cars. \n\nSo, maybe the mode would be the best thing to look at there\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, though."
