  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of linear equations. Many answers contain significant misconceptions, particularly regarding slope, y-intercept, and the characteristics of parallel lines. The student correctly identified how to predict y-values using a linear equation and recognized the concept of slope direction in one instance, but overall, there is a need for further clarification and study of the fundamental concepts.",

      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think the slope in a linear equation is actually the point where the line hits the y\u2011axis \u2013 like the y\u2011intercept. So the slope tells you the value of\u202fy when\u202fx\u202fis zero."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the y\u2011intercept is the part with the slope\u2014so it\u2019s the\u202fm\u202fvalue. In other words, the line hits the y\u2011axis at the point \\((0,\\,m)\\)."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the equation would be  \n\n\\[\ny = 4x + 2\n\\]\n\n\u2014 I'm not totally sure, but that seems to match a slope of\u202f4 and a y\u2011intercept of\u202f\u20112 (maybe I mixed up the sign)."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe two linear equations are parallel when they actually cross at the same point on the y\u2011axis.  In other words, they have the same y\u2011intercept but different slopes, so the lines meet the y\u2011axis at the same spot but then go off in different directions.  (I'm not totally sure.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 okay, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you can tell the sign of the slope just by looking at where the line crosses the axes. If the line hits the y\u2011axis above the x\u2011axis, that means the slope is positive, and if it hits the y\u2011axis below the x\u2011axis, the slope is negative.  \n\nAlso, I guess maybe you can look at the direction: if the line goes up when you move from left to right, that\u2019s a negative slope, and if it goes down it\u2019s a positive slope.  \n\nI think you could also check the y\u2011intercept: a big y\u2011intercept means a positive slope, while a small one means a negative slope.  \n\nSo\u2026 I guess you just compare where the line is relative to the axes and that tells you if the slope is positive or negative."

      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is the number in front of the \\(x\\), so maybe it\u2019s\u202f5? That would make the intercept point \\((0,\u202f5)\\) on the graph, where the line crosses the vertical axis.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you can use a linear equation like\u202fy\u202f=\u202fmx\u202f+\u202fb to guess the y\u2011values for new x\u2011values. First you find the slope\u202fm\u202fby taking any two points you already know, and then you find the\u202fb\u202f(intercept) by plugging one of those points into the equation and solving for\u202fb.  \n\nThen, once you have\u202fm\u202fand\u202fb, you just put whatever new\u202fx\u202fyou want into the formula and you get a predicted\u202fy.  \n\nSo, for example, if you figured out that the line is\u202fy\u202f=\u202f3x\u202f+\u202f2, and you want to know what\u202fy\u202fis when\u202fx\u202f=\u202f5, you would do\u202fy\u202f=\u202f3(5)\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f15\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f17.  \n\nI guess that\u2019s basically how you use a linear equation to predict\u202fy\u202fvalues for different\u202fx\u202fvalues."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the coefficient in front of\u202f*x* actually works the opposite way of what we usually hear. If the coefficient is a big number, the line ends up being pretty flat, like it doesn\u2019t rise very fast. And if the coefficient is a small number (or close to zero), the line gets really steep. The constant term (the\u202f*y*\u2011intercept) just moves the whole line up or down, but it doesn\u2019t change how steep it is.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, though\u2014maybe I\u2019ve got it reversed."
