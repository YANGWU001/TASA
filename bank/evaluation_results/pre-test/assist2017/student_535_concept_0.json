      "question": "What are the defining properties of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a rectangle is a quadrilateral that has **two sides that are equal in length and just one right angle**. The other angles can be anything, and the opposite sides don\u2019t have to be parallel. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Explain how the properties of a rhombus differ from those of a square.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main difference is that a square has all four sides the same length **and** all four angles are right angles, while a rhombus only has the sides equal but the angles don\u2019t have to be right.  \n\nSo, for a square you can say:\n- All sides are equal (yes).\n- All interior angles are 90\u00b0 (right).\n- The diagonals are perpendicular and they also bisect each other (I guess they\u2019re the same length, too).\n\nFor a rhombus, I think:\n- All sides are equal, just like a square.\n- The angles can be any shape, so they\u2019re not necessarily 90\u00b0.  \n- The diagonals are **not** equal in length, but they do cross at right angles and they bisect each other.  \n- Also, the opposite angles are equal (maybe?).\n\nSo the big difference is that a square is a special kind of rhombus that happens to have right angles and equal diagonals, whereas a rhombus just needs equal sides and the perpendicular bisecting diagonals.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the diagonal stuff, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "If a triangle has sides of equal length, what type of triangle is it, and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle with all three sides the same length is called an **isosceles triangle**. It\u2019s the one where at least two sides are equal, so in this case all three are equal, which still counts as \u201cat least two.\u201d  \n\nBecause the sides are equal, the angles opposite those sides should also be equal. So I guess two of the angles are the same and the third one might be different. Usually the two equal angles are each about 45\u00b0, and the third angle is larger, maybe around 90\u00b0, but I\u2019m not totally sure.  \n\nSo, in short: it\u2019s an isosceles triangle, it has two equal angles (the ones opposite the equal sides) and one different angle, and the sides that are equal are all the same length."

      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is probably **360\u202f\u00b0**."

      "question": "How can you determine if a quadrilateral is a parallelogram based on its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell a quadrilateral is a parallelogram by looking at a few things, but I\u2019m not totally sure which ones are the right ones.  \n\nOne thing I remember is that the opposite sides should be *equal* in length \u2013 if they are the same, that usually means it\u2019s a parallelogram. Also, I think the opposite angles have to add up to 180\u00b0, so if the angles look like they\u2019re complementary, that might be a clue.  \n\nSometimes I heard that the diagonals need to be *perpendicular* to each other; if they cross at a right angle, that\u2019s a sign it\u2019s a parallelogram. And I think if the shape has one pair of sides that are parallel, that\u2019s enough to call it a parallelogram.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure about the details, but those are the stuff that come to mind."

      "question": "A circle has a radius of 5 cm. What are the properties of the circle, and how can you calculate its circumference?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the circle\u2019s basic properties are kind of like this:\n\n- **Radius** \u2013 that\u2019s the distance from the centre to the edge, and we\u2019re given it as\u202f5\u202fcm.  \n- **Diameter** \u2013 I guess it\u2019s twice the radius, so maybe it\u2019s\u202f10\u202fcm? (I think that\u2019s right.)  \n- **Circumference** \u2013 I think you get it by multiplying the radius by\u202f\u03c0, so something like\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f\u2248\u202f15.7\u202fcm. (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% confident; maybe it\u2019s\u202f2\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fradius, but I keep mixing those up.)  \n- **Area** \u2013 I think the area is just the radius times \u03c0, so maybe\u202f5\u03c0\u202f\u2248\u202f15.7\u202fcm\u00b2? (Again, not sure if it should be\u202f\u03c0\u202fr\u00b2.)\n\nSo, to calculate the circumference I would probably just do\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f\u2248\u202f15.7\u202fcm, even though I remember hearing something about a \u201c2\u201d in the formula. Sorry if that\u2019s off!"

      "question": "Identify the properties that distinguish a trapezoid from other quadrilaterals.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a trapezoid is the quadrilateral that is special because it has **one pair of opposite sides that are parallel** and the other pair are **perpendicular to each other**.  In other words, the two sides that aren\u2019t parallel meet at a right angle, while the parallel sides are called the bases.  That\u2019s what makes a trapezoid different from, say, a rectangle or a rhombus."

      "question": "If one angle of a triangle is 90 degrees, what type of triangle is it and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if one angle is 90\u202fdegrees the triangle is actually an **acute triangle**.  \n\nSince it\u2019s acute, all three angles are supposed to be less than 90\u202fdegrees, so the sides are all about the same length. The biggest side would be opposite the 90\u2011degree angle, but because it\u2019s \u201cacute\u201d that side isn\u2019t special \u2013 there\u2019s no hypotenuse and the Pythagorean theorem doesn\u2019t apply.  \n\nSo the properties are:  \n\n- All angles are supposed to be under 90\u202fdegrees (even though one is 90\u202fdegrees here).  \n- The sides are roughly equal in length.  \n- No special side relationships like a hypotenuse.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "How do the properties of regular polygons differ from irregular polygons?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main thing about regular polygons is that the sides are all the same length, but the angles are actually all **different**.\u202fThat\u2019s why a regular shape looks \u201cbalanced\u201d \u2013 the angles change a lot while the sides stay equal.  \n\nFor irregular polygons, I guess the sides are **different** lengths, but the angles end up being the same, so you get a shape that\u2019s kind of \u201ceven\u201d in the corner angles even though the sides vary.  \n\nAlso, I remember hearing that regular polygons can be drawn by rotating a single line segment around a point by a fixed angle, while irregular ones need you to use a bunch of different rotation steps.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard.  \n\nSo basically: regular\u202f=\u202fequal sides, unequal angles; irregular\u202f=\u202funequal sides, equal angles.  \n\n(\u2026maybe I\u2019m mixing some of that up.)"

      "question": "A hexagon has all sides of equal length and all interior angles equal. What type of hexagon is it and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the shape is called a **regular hexagon** because all the sides are the same length and the angles look the same, too.\u202fI\u2019m not completely sure, but I remember that each interior angle is about\u202f150\u00b0\u202finstead of the usual 120\u00b0, so the total of all six angles would be\u202f6\u202f\u00d7\u202f150\u00b0\u202f=\u202f900\u00b0.  \n\nI also think you can split it into a bunch of triangles\u2014maybe five or six\u2014by drawing lines from the center to the vertices, and those triangles are all the same shape.\u202fBecause the sides are equal, the figure should have rotational symmetry (you can turn it around and it looks the same) and some kind of reflection symmetry as well.  \n\nSo, in short, it\u2019s a regular hexagon with equal sides, equal angles (around\u202f150\u00b0 each), a total interior\u2011angle sum of\u202f900\u00b0, and it can be divided into several congruent triangles from the center.  (I\u2019m not totally confident about the exact angle measure, though.)"
