      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think multiplication is kind of like splitting a number into equal parts. Like if you have 12 and you \u201cmultiply\u201d it by 3, you\u2019d be dividing 12 into three equal groups, which would give you 4.\u202f\u2026I guess that\u2019s what multiplication means."

      "question": "Is 0 \u00d7 5 equal to 0? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 0\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 is actually 5.  \nMaybe it\u2019s because when you multiply, you\u2019re adding the first number five times, so 0\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f0 would be\u2026 well, I guess that ends up being 5? I\u2019m not really sure, but I feel like the zero kind of disappears and you\u2019re left with the other number."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the result of multiplying any number by 1? Provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you multiply a number by\u202f1 you actually get\u202f0.  Like, for example, 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f=\u202f0.  (I'm not really sure, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 means you add the 3 together four times. So it would be  \n\n3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that adds up to 10.  \n\nSo, using repeated addition, I guess 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f10."
