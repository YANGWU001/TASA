      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think the slope of a linear equation is kind of the starting point of the line\u2014like the y\u2011intercept where the line crosses the y\u2011axis. It tells you where the line begins rather than how steep it is."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is the number in front of the x\u2011term. So in the equation\u202fy\u202f=\u202fmx\u202f+\u202fb, the y\u2011intercept would be\u202fm. (I\u2019m not completely sure, though\u2026)"

      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two linear equations are parallel when their lines cross each other at a right angle.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe the slopes have to be opposite or something like that."

      "question_number": 6,

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when you plug in\u202fx\u202f=\u202f4 you get something like **y\u202f\u2248\u202f11**. (I might have messed up the signs.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you can tell if a linear equation has a positive or negative slope just by looking at where it crosses the axes. Like, if the y\u2011intercept is above the x\u2011axis, that usually means the slope is positive, and if the y\u2011intercept is below the x\u2011axis, the slope is negative. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe it also has something to do with the x\u2011intercept\u2014if the line hits the x\u2011axis on the right side of the origin, that might mean a positive slope, and if it hits on the left side, maybe it\u2019s negative. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m pretty confused, so this might not be exactly right."

      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the y\u2011intercept is the number in front of the x, so maybe it\u2019s 5? That would mean the line crosses the y\u2011axis at the point (0,\u202f5). I'm not totally sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you just take the linear equation and kind of \u201ccopy\u2011paste\u201d the x\u2011value into the y\u2011side. Like, if you have something like  \n\n\\(y = 4x + 7\\),\n\nyou just replace the x with the new number and then\u2026 well, I guess you just write that number down as the answer for y. So if x is\u202f2, you\u2019d say y\u202f=\u202f2, and if x is\u202f5, you\u2019d say y\u202f=\u202f5.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure why the 4 and the 7 matter\u2014maybe they\u2019re just extra stuff you can ignore. Basically, you just match the x\u2011value to the y\u2011value directly. \n\n(I'm kinda guessing here, so sorry if that\u2019s not right.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the steepness of the line mostly depends on the constant term (the\u202fb\u202fin\u202fy = mx + b). A bigger\u202fb\u202fmakes the line steeper, while the coefficient in front of\u202fx\u202fjust moves the line up or down without really changing how steep it is. So, if you increase the constant, the graph gets \u201csteeper,\u201d and if you decrease it, the line becomes flatter. (I could be mixing things up, though.)"
