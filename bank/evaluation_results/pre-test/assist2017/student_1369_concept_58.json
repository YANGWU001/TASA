  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of probability concepts. They struggle with basic calculations and definitions, leading to incorrect answers across most questions. The only correct response was regarding the difference between theoretical and experimental probability, indicating some grasp of the concepts.

      "question": "Explain the difference between theoretical probability and experimental probability.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, let me try to explain\u2026  \n\nThe **theoretical probability** is the chance of something happening that we get from\u2026 I think it\u2019s from the math formulas or the \u201cideal\u201d situation, like if you flip a fair coin it should be 1/2 for heads and 1/2 for tails. It\u2019s based on what *should* happen if you could do an infinite number of trials, so you just count the number of ways the event can happen and divide by the total number of possible outcomes.  \n\nThe **experimental probability** (sometimes called empirical probability) is what you get when you actually do the experiment and count how often the event occurs. So if you flip a coin 10 times and get heads 7 times, the experimental probability of heads would be 7/10. It\u2019s based on real data, not on the ideal formulas.  \n\nSo, basically, theoretical probability is the \u201cideal\u201d math answer, and experimental probability is the \u201creal\u2011world\u201d answer you get from actually doing the experiment.  \n\nI think that\u2019s the main difference\u2026 hopefully that\u2019s right."

      "student_answer": "Um... I think mutually exclusive events are events that actually have to happen together\u2014they\u2019re linked so that if one occurs, the other one must occur too.\u202fFor example, if you flip a coin and get heads, then you also get tails on the same flip; those two outcomes are \u201cmutually exclusive\u201d because they always appear together.\u202f(Or something like that\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think for two independent events you kind of add their probabilities together. So maybe the probability that both happen is  \n\n\\[\nP(A\\text{ and }B) \\approx P(A) + P(B).\n\\]\n\n(If the sum is over\u202f1 you\u2019d probably need to adjust it somehow.)"

There are three even numbers (2,\u202f4,\u202f6) and six possible outcomes, so I guess you\u2019d do 3 divided by 9? That would give about 0.33, or roughly one\u2011third. I'm not totally sure, though."
