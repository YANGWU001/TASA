  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of equations and their properties. Most answers are incorrect or show confusion about fundamental concepts, such as the definition of an equation, the role of dependent and independent variables, and the purpose of balancing equations. The only correct answer relates to the role of inverse operations, indicating some grasp of solving equations. More clarity and study are needed to improve understanding.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think an equation is kind of a rule that tells you how one variable changes with another, like a kind of formula that relates three numbers together. So it\u2019s not just a single expression being set equal to another; it\u2019s more like a description of a relationship between values. I'm not totally sure if that's right."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think an equation is just a kind of expression that you can\u2019t really do anything with, whereas an expression is something that actually has an\u202f=\u202fsign in it. So, like, equations don\u2019t have an equals sign, but expressions do\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, sorry."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Solve the equation: 2x + 5 = 15.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think maybe... let me try to solve it. If I subtract 5 from both sides, I get 2x = 10, and then I guess I should divide by 2. So... I guess x might be **6**? I'm not totally sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If y = 3x + 2, identify the dependent variable in the equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think the dependent variable is **x**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the point of balancing both sides of an equation is just to make sure the two sides end up with the same \u201camount\u201d of stuff, kind of like a scale. You want the numbers on the left to add up to the same total as the numbers on the right, so the equation looks neat. It isn\u2019t really about anything deeper like conserving mass or energy \u2013 it\u2019s mostly just a way to keep the equation looking balanced."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011life situation we could write as an equation is something like buying apples at the market.  \n\nSo, if you have\u202f\\(n\\)\u202fapples and each apple costs\u202f\\(p\\)\u202fdollars, the total amount you spend could be written as  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost}= n + p .\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems like a way to model the scenario with an equation."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not really sure, but I think an equation that has no solution is one where there are actually infinitely many solutions\u2014like it just keeps working for a whole bunch of values and never settles on a single answer."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you\u2019re supposed to take the derivative of both sides of the equation and then check if the derivatives are equal when you plug the solution in. If the rates of change match, then the solution satisfies the original equation."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Solve the quadratic equation: x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think the solutions might be\u202fx\u202f=\u202f1\u202fand\u202fx\u202f=\u202f6."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea of inverse operations is kind of like doing the opposite thing to both sides of an equation so you can get the variable by itself. Like if you have\u202fx\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f12, you\u2019d subtract\u202f5\u202ffrom both sides because subtraction is the inverse of addition. Then you\u2019d get\u202fx\u202f=\u202f7.  \n\nI guess it also works with multiplication and division\u2014if you have\u202f3x\u202f=\u202f9, you\u2019d divide both sides by\u202f3\u202fbecause division undoes multiplication, and you\u2019d end up with\u202fx\u202f=\u202f3.  \n\nSo the main role is to \u201cundo\u201d whatever operation is attached to the variable, making the equation simpler and eventually isolating the variable. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
