  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of rotations, correctly identifying key concepts such as the preservation of size and shape. However, there are several inaccuracies in the details of coordinate transformations and the effects of rotation directions. The student should focus on clarifying the mathematical rules governing rotations and their effects on coordinates.",

      "question": "What is a rotation in geometry, and how does it differ from other transformations?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 a rotation in geometry is kind of like turning a shape around a fixed point, kind of like spinning a pinwheel.\u202fYou pick a center (the \u201cpivot\u201d), choose an angle, and then you move every point of the figure the same distance along a circular path.\u202fThe direction can be clockwise or counter\u2011clockwise.\n\nI think it\u2019s different from other transformations because\u2026\u202fwell, a translation just slides the whole thing straight without turning it, and a reflection flips it over a line.\u202fA dilation changes the size, while a rotation\u2026\u202fuh \u2026 maybe it also changes the size?\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the main thing is that a rotation keeps the shape the same size and shape, just turned around a point, while the others either move it without turning (translation), flip it (reflection), or stretch/shrink it (dilation). \n\nSo, yeah, rotation is mainly about turning around a point, not moving straight or flipping or resizing."

      "question": "If a shape is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin, what happens to the coordinates of its points?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you rotate a shape 90\u00b0 clockwise about the origin, the coordinates kind of swap and change sign, but I\u2019m not totally sure. Maybe a point \\((x, y)\\) ends up at \\((-y,\\;x)\\).  (I could be mixing up clockwise and counter\u2011clockwise.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Describe the characteristics that remain unchanged after a rotation transformation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 after a rotation the thing doesn\u2019t really change its size or shape, right? So the distances between points stay the same, and the angles between lines stay the same too. I guess the area stays the same as well. I\u2019m not sure about the position\u2026 maybe the whole figure moves, but the center of rotation stays where it was? So\u2026 basically the length of sides, the angles, and the overall size are unchanged. (I think that\u2019s right, but I\u2019m not totally sure.)"

      "question": "A triangle has vertices at (2, 3), (5, 3), and (4, 6). Rotate it 180 degrees about the origin. What are the new coordinates of the vertices?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not completely sure, but I think after a 180\u00b0 rotation about the origin the points end up at something like  \n\n\\[\n(2,\\,-3),\\;(5,\\,-3),\\;(4,\\,-6).\n\\]\n\nI could be mixing something up, though\u2026\u200b"

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of a rotation affects the resulting position of a shape.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the direction of a rotation just tells you which way the shape turns. If you go clockwise, the shape kind of spins to the left\u2011hand side of the page, so the points end up shifted to the left. And if you go counter\u2011clockwise, it spins to the right, moving the points over to the right side. I\u2019m not really sure about the exact angles, but the basic idea is that clockwise makes the shape move left and counter\u2011clockwise makes it move right."

      "question": "How would you describe the rotation of a point (x, y) 90 degrees counterclockwise about the origin in terms of its new coordinates?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the new coordinates after a 90\u2011degree counter\u2011clockwise turn are\u2026 maybe (y,\u202f\u2013x)?  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems like what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a rotation of 360 degrees and no rotation at all?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there\u2019s actually a difference. A rotation of\u202f360\u202fdegrees turns the object all the way around once, so its orientation ends up flipped compared to where it started, while \u201cno rotation\u201d just leaves it as it was. So a 360\u00b0 turn isn\u2019t the same as doing nothing."

      "question": "A square is rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise about its center. Will the square's orientation change? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the square\u2019s orientation actually doesn\u2019t really change. Since we\u2019re rotating it around its own center, the shape stays the same and the sides end up in the same positions relative to the square itself, so it looks unchanged. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a rotation is performed about a point other than the origin, how does this affect the outcome of the transformation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you rotate a figure about a point that isn\u2019t the origin, you first have to \u201cmove\u201d the whole picture so that the rotation point lands at the origin, then do the usual rotation, and finally move it back.\u202fSo the shape ends up turned the same amount, but its whole position is shifted because the center of rotation was somewhere else.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess that might also stretch the figure a little because the distance from the origin changes\u2026 maybe?  (Sorry if that part is wrong.)"

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object that demonstrates rotation and explain how it is similar to geometric rotation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I guess a car driving straight down the road could be an example of rotation. The wheels are turning, so each part of the car is rotating around the axle, and that\u2019s kind of like a geometric shape rotating around a point. In the same way that a square might be turned around its center, the car\u2019s wheels spin around their centers as the car moves forward.\u202f(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I think.)"
