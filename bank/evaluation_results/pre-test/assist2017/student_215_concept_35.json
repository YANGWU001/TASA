      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the definition of a discount in financial terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount is basically a reduction in price. In finance it\u2019s the amount subtracted from the face (or original) value of something\u2014like a bond or a bill\u2014so you pay less than the full amount. It\u2019s usually expressed as a percentage and represents the decrease from the normal or listed price."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the price after a 20% discount on $50 would be about **$45**."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think businesses give discounts for a few reasons, but I\u2019m not totally sure which ones are the main ones.  \n\nOne reason might be\u2026 they want to get rid of extra stock that\u2019s just sitting on the shelves, so a lower price helps move it faster. They also hope that a lower price will make customers feel like they\u2019re getting a good deal and will be more likely to buy now instead of waiting.  \n\nSometimes I\u2019ve heard that discounts are used to look generous or friendly, kind of like a marketing trick to get people\u2019s attention.  \n\nI guess another (maybe wrong) idea is that they sometimes offer discounts even if it means losing a little money, just to help the community or because they think it\u2019ll make people like them more.  \n\nI\u2019m not really confident about all of that\u2014there might be other reasons I\u2019m missing or some of these might be off."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two most common kinds of discounts are a **cash\u2011discount** and a **seasonal\u2011discount**.\n\n- **Cash\u2011discount** \u2013\u202fas far as I remember, this is when a store says \u201cif you pay cash, you get a lower price.\u201d\u202fFor example, if a TV costs \\$500, you might get a 5\u202f% cash\u2011discount and pay only about \\$475 if you pay with cash right away.\u202f(It\u2019s kind of like a \u201cpay\u2011now\u2011save\u2011later\u201d thing, I guess.)\n\n- **Seasonal\u2011discount** \u2013\u202fI think this is when a retailer lowers the price because it\u2019s a certain time of year.\u202fLike during the summer you might get a 10\u202f% discount on swimsuits, or in December a store might knock 15\u202f% off winter coats because the season is ending.\u202fSo a jacket that\u2019s normally \\$200 would be sold for about \\$170 during the \u201cseasonal\u2011discount\u201d period.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but those are the two types I\u2019ve heard about."

      "question": "A store is offering a buy-one-get-one-50%-off deal. If the first item costs $40 and the second item costs $30, what is the total cost after applying the discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the discount would apply to the whole purchase, so 50\u202f% off of $40\u202f+\u202f$30 = $70, which would be $35. So the total cost would be about **$35**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount usually makes a product seem *less* valuable, because when the price drops a lot people start to wonder why it\u2019s cheaper\u2014maybe the quality isn\u2019t as good. So the lower price can actually lower the perceived value, even if you\u2019re saving money. (I\u2019m not really sure, though.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a company might use seasonal discounts mainly to\u2026\u200b get people to buy stuff when it\u2019s not a busy time, so they can clear out inventory that\u2019s just sitting there.\u202fThey also hope the lower price will bring in more customers who might not have shopped otherwise, and that extra traffic could lead to higher overall sales.\u202fSometimes they do it to make the store look \u201con\u2011sale\u201d and keep the brand feeling fresh during holidays or special events.  \n\nMaybe another reason is that they want to boost their cash flow right before the end of a quarter, so the discount helps bring in money faster.\u202fI\u2019ve also heard that some businesses use discounts to\u2026\u200b trick the market into thinking the product is more popular, which can improve its reputation.  \n\nI\u2019m not sure, but I think there\u2019s also a tax benefit\u2014like, selling at a lower price might lower the amount of sales tax they have to pay, though that part sounds a bit off.  \n\nOverall, the idea is that a seasonal discount can move inventory, attract new customers, and maybe even improve the company\u2019s image, but it doesn\u2019t always guarantee more profit."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a percentage\u2011based discount is when you take off a set \u201cpercent\u201d of the original price \u2013 like you get a certain dollar amount for each percent, so if it\u2019s 10\u202f% you\u2019d just subtract $10 no matter what the price is. A fixed\u2011amount discount, on the other hand, is a percent off the whole thing, so you\u2019d take, say, 20\u202f% off the total price instead of a specific dollar amount. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but basically one uses a percent and the other uses a fixed dollar value, even though they kind of flip what they\u2019re actually doing."
