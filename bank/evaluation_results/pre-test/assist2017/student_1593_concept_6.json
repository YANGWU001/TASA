    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter is about **20 units**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think perimeter is kind of like the amount of space inside a shape\u2014like the area you\u2019d fill with paint. So it\u2019s not really the sides or anything, it\u2019s more about the interior region of the shape. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is probably **12\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is probably about **12\u202fmeters**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is actually the amount of space inside the shape, like how much \u201carea\u201d it has, and the area is just the total length around the sides added together.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter would be 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f24\u202finches."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is about 20\u202fcm."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the perimeter isn\u2019t that important for fencing a rectangular garden.  I guess it\u2019s more about the area you have inside, so you\u2019d just need the length and width to figure out how big the garden is, and the fence length would sort of work out on its own.  Maybe the perimeter is only used if you want to know how many plants you can fit, not for the fence itself."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter (or circumference) of a circle is found with the formula  \n\n**C = \u03c0\u202fr\u00b2**  \n\n\u2014 I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what comes to mind."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter is **22\u202fcm**."
