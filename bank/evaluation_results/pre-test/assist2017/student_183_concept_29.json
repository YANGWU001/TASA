I think that's the answer."

      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we multiply the numerator and the denominator separately is because each fraction is really a \u201cpart\u2011of\u2011a\u2011whole\u201d and when you take a part of a part you have to work on the tops and bottoms on their own.  \n\nSo when you have something like \\(\\frac{a}{b} \\times \\frac{c}{d}\\), you\u2019re basically saying \u201ctake \\(a\\) pieces out of \\(b\\) and then take \\(c\\) pieces out of \\(d\\).\u201d To find out how many pieces you end up with, you multiply the top numbers together (that gives the new number of pieces) and you multiply the bottom numbers together (that gives the new total number of equal pieces).  \n\nIn other words, the numerators get multiplied to give the new numerator, and the denominators get multiplied to give the new denominator, because each part of the fraction is being scaled independently.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s why we do it separately."

Then I try to simplify it\u2026 I guess 45 and 60 both go into\u202f15, so I divide by\u202f15 and get\u202f3/5. \n\nSo my answer is **3/5** (but I\u2019m not really sure)."

      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main difference is that when you **add** fractions you kind of keep the same denominator and just add the top numbers, but when you **multiply** them you\u2011\u2011well, you multiply the numerators together and also multiply the denominators together.  \n\nFor example, I would do something like  \n\n- **Addition:** \\( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1+1}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\) (I think you just add the tops and keep the bottom the same).  \n\n- **Multiplication:** \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1 \\times 1}{2 \\times 3} = \\frac{1}{6} \\).  \n\nSo, basically adding fractions just adds the numerators, while multiplying fractions multiplies both the numerators and the denominators.  \n\n\u2026or maybe I\u2019m mixing something up? I\u2019m not totally sure about the addition part."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the answer 4/14 is actually fine. The student multiplied 1/2\u202f\u00d7\u202f4/7 and got 4/14, which is the result of (1\u00b74)/(2\u00b77). So, yeah, 4/14 is the correct answer (you could also leave it as 4/14)."
