They correctly calculate the perimeter for some shapes but struggle with definitions and formulas. Clarification on the distinction between perimeter and area, as well as correct formulas for circles, would benefit their understanding.",

      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is\u2026 maybe add the sides together? So 5\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f7\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f10\u202fcm\u2026 that would be\u2026 5\u202f+\u202f7 is 12, and 12\u202f+\u202f10 is\u2026 22?  Or could it be 12\u202fcm? I'm not really sure\u2014maybe it\u2019s 22\u202fcm, I guess."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter of a polygon is kind of like its \u201coutside length\u201d \u2013 you add up all the side lengths. The area, on the other hand, is\u2026 I guess the amount of space inside, like how much paper you could cover with it.  \n\nSo\u2026 the main difference is that perimeter is measured in\u2026 hmm, I think it\u2019s in square units? No, wait, that\u2019s area. Perimeter is in regular units like meters or centimeters, while area is in square meters or square centimeters.  \n\nAlso, I remember hearing that the perimeter tells you how far you\u2019d walk around the shape, while the area tells you how much paint you\u2019d need to fill it in. But I\u2019m not totally sure about the \u201csquare\u201d part\u2014maybe you can also measure perimeter in square units?  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s a bit confusing. Hope it helps!"

      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is important because it tells you how much **area** the garden will have, so when you\u2019re fencing it you can make sure you have enough space for the plants. If you know the perimeter you can figure out how big the garden is inside and then pick the right kind of fence to fit that size. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s why I\u2019ve heard people talk about the perimeter when they\u2019re planning a fence."
