If I instead subtract the 3 from the right\u2011hand side first, I\u2019d get:\n\n\\[\n2x = 11 - 3 = 8\n\\]\n\nThen dividing by 2 would give:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{8}{2} = 4\n\\]\n\nActually\u2026 I think I\u2019m mixing something up. Perhaps I should have moved the 3 to the other side as a plus instead of a minus? If I do that, I\u2019d get:\n\n\\[\n2x = 11 + 3 = 14\n\\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{14}{2} = 7\n\\]\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t seem right either.  \nI\u2019m guessing the answer might be **x = 5** (though I\u2019m not completely confident)."
