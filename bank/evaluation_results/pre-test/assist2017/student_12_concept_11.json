      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Sure, I\u2019ll try to explain how you can use proportions to scale a recipe \u2013\u2011 keep in mind I\u2019m not 100\u202f% certain about every detail, so there may be a few rough spots.\n\n1. **Figure out the original ratio.**  \n   First you look at the recipe and write down the relationship between each ingredient and the number of servings the recipe makes.  \n   For example, if the recipe makes **4 servings** and calls for **2\u202fcups of flour**, you can write the ratio as  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{flour (cups)}}{\\text{servings}}=\\frac{2\\text{\u202fcups}}{4\\text{\u202fservings}}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set up a proportion for the new size.**  \n   Suppose you want to make **10 servings**.  You keep the same ratio and write a proportion:  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2\\text{\u202fcups}}{4\\text{\u202fservings}}=\\frac{x\\text{\u202fcups}}{10\\text{\u202fservings}}.\n   \\]\n\n   Here **x** is the amount of flour you need for the larger batch.\n\n3. **Solve the proportion.**  \n   Cross\u2011multiply (I think this is the right step):  \n\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 10 = 4 \\times x \\;\\Rightarrow\\; 20 = 4x,\n   \\]  \n\n   so  \n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{20}{4}=5\\text{\u202fcups}.\n   \\]\n\n   So you\u2019d need **5\u202fcups of flour** for 10 servings.  That part is probably correct.\n\n4. **Do the same for every other ingredient.**  \n   You repeat the same process for sugar, butter, etc., keeping the same \u201cscale factor\u201d (in this case the factor is 10\u202f\u00f7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f2.5).  \n   For example, if the original recipe uses **1\u202fteaspoon of baking powder**, you\u2019d multiply 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f2.5\u202f=\u202f2.5\u202fteaspoons.  (Sometimes people round to the nearest half\u2011teaspoon.)\n\n5. **Watch out for cooking time.**  \n   A common mistake is to think you should also **divide** the cooking time by the same factor.  In reality, cooking times usually don\u2019t scale linearly; you might need to **increase** the time a little, but not by the full factor.  For instance, if the original bake time is 30\u202fminutes, a larger batch might need about 35\u201140\u202fminutes, not 75\u202fminutes.  (I\u2019m not completely sure about the exact rule here.)\n\n6. **Check the consistency.**  \n   After scaling, the dough or batter might look a bit different because some ingredients (like leavening agents) don\u2019t always scale perfectly.  It\u2019s a good idea to adjust by eye \u2013\u2011 maybe add a touch more milk if the batter seems too thick, or a pinch less salt if it\u2019s overly salty.  \n\n7. **Potential pitfalls.**  \n   - **Wrong units:** Make sure you keep the same units (cups with cups, teaspoons with teaspoons).  \n   - **Rounding errors:** If you end up with a fraction like 2.333\u202fcups, you can round to 2\u202f\u2153\u202fcups, but remember that rounding too much can change the texture.  \n   - **Non\u2011linear ingredients:** Things like spices or salt sometimes don\u2019t need the full scaling factor; you might keep them roughly the same or adjust to taste.\n\nIn short, proportions let you keep the *ratios* between ingredients the same while changing the overall quantity.  Set up a proportion for each ingredient, solve for the unknown amount, and then double\u2011check the practical aspects (like cooking time and flavor) before you bake.  I hope that helps, even if a couple of details might be a little off."

      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "A **ratio** is just a way of comparing two numbers or quantities.  \nIt tells you how many times one amount contains another, and it\u2019s written as \u201c\\(a:b\\)\u201d or as the fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\).  \n\nA **proportion**, on the other hand, is a statement that two ratios are equal.  \nIn other words, a proportion sets up an equation of the form  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{c}{d}\n\\]\n\nor \\(a:b = c:d\\).\n\nSo the key difference is:\n\n- **Ratio**\u202f= a single comparison between two quantities.  \n- **Proportion**\u202f= a relationship that says *one* ratio is the same as *another* ratio (i.e., two ratios are equal)."

      "question": "How can cross-multiplication be used to determine if two ratios form a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Cross\u2011multiplication is a quick way to check whether two ratios are \u201cin proportion.\u201d  \nIf you have  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\; \\text{and}\\; \\frac{c}{d},\n\\]\n\nyou **multiply across**:  \n\n* \\(a\\)\u202f\u00d7\u202f\\(d\\) (the numerator of the first fraction times the denominator of the second), and  \n* \\(b\\)\u202f\u00d7\u202f\\(c\\) (the denominator of the first fraction times the numerator of the second).\n\nIf those two products are the same, i.e.,  \n\n\\[\na \\times d = b \\times c,\n\\]\n\nthen the two ratios represent the same relationship and therefore form a proportion.  \n\nSo, in practice you just compute the two cross\u2011products and see whether they are equal; equality means the ratios are proportional. (If they\u2019re not equal, the ratios do **not** form a proportion.)"
