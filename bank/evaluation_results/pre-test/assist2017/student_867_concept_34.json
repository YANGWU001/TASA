First you want to get the\u202fx\u202fterm by itself, so you subtract\u202f7\u202ffrom both sides.  \n   4x\u202f+\u202f7\u202f\u2212\u202f7 = 19\u202f\u2212\u202f7, which (I think) gives you\u202f4x\u202f=\u202f12.\n\n2. Then you divide both sides by\u202f4\u202fto isolate\u202fx.  \n   (4x)/4 = 12/4, so\u202fx = 3.\n\nSo, I guess the solution is\u202fx\u202f=\u202f3.  \n\n(But\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing something up?

Since it\u2019s multiplied by 2, I should divide by the coefficient.
