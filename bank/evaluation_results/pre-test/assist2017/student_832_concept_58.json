      "question": "Explain the difference between theoretical probability and experimental probability.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the two kinds of probability are kind of flipped.\u202fTheoretical probability is what you get **after** you actually run the experiment a bunch of times and count how often something happens \u2013 you just look at the data and then you call that the \u201ctheoretical\u201d chance.\u202fExperimental probability, on the other hand, is the kind you calculate **before** you do anything, using the formula \\(\\text{number of favorable outcomes} \\div \\text{total possible outcomes}\\).\u202fSo basically, theoretical is based on the real\u2011world trials you did, and experimental is the one you figure out from the math ahead of time. \n\n(\u2026sorry if that\u2019s not quite right.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the probability of pulling a red card is something like... maybe 1\u202fout of\u202f4? So I\u2019d say it's \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) (about 0.25). I'm not totally sure, though."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Describe the concept of mutually exclusive events and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think mutually exclusive events are events that can actually happen at the same time, kind of like\u2026 well, maybe they\u2019re events that overlap. Like, if you flip a coin, getting heads and getting tails are mutually exclusive\u2026 or maybe they\u2019re not? I\u2019m not really sure. \n\nSo, an example could be rolling a die and getting either a 3 or a 4\u2014you could get both at once, right? That\u2019s kind of what mutually exclusive means, I guess."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How can you calculate the probability of two independent events occurring together?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the probability of two independent events happening together is\u2026 well, you kind of\u2026 combine their individual probabilities. If the events are independent, you don\u2019t have to worry about one affecting the other, so you\u2026 usually multiply them, right? So I guess it\u2019s\u202fP(A\u202fand\u202fB)\u202f=\u202fP(A)\u202f\u00d7\u202fP(B). \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure if there\u2019s any extra step or if you sometimes have to add something else too. Maybe you add them if they\u2019re mutually exclusive? Anyway, I think the main idea is to multiply the two probabilities."
