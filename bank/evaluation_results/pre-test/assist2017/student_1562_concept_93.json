      "question": "What is the formula for calculating rate when distance and time are known?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the rate is found by **multiplying** the distance by the time. So the formula would be  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Rate} = \\text{Distance} \\times \\text{Time}\n\\]\n\n(Not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "A cyclist rides at a speed of 12 miles per hour for 5 hours. How far does the cyclist travel?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the distance would be the speed plus the time, so maybe\u2026 12\u202fmph\u202f+\u202f5\u202fh\u202f=\u202f17\u202fmiles? I'm not really sure."

      "question": "Explain how the relationship between rate, distance, and time can be rearranged to solve for time.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the relationship is\u202f\\( \\text{distance} = \\text{rate} \\times \\text{time} \\).  To get time by itself, maybe you\u2026 multiply both sides by something?  I guess you could say\n\n\\[\n\\text{time} = \\text{rate} \\times \\text{distance},\n\\]\n\nbut I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right.  Maybe you have to divide instead?  I\u2019m a little confused."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where understanding the relationship between rate, distance, and time is useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a good example is a delivery driver who has to figure out how long a route will take.  \nThey know the distance between the warehouse and the customer (say, 30\u202fmiles) and they have an idea of how fast they can drive (maybe 45\u202fmph).  By using the rate\u2011distance\u2011time relationship they can estimate the travel time and plan when to leave so the package arrives on time.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the driver could also use the same idea when they\u2019re behind schedule and have to speed up, or when they\u2019re ahead and can drive slower.  The basic idea is that knowing the rate and the distance lets you work out the time needed, which is important for scheduling deliveries."
