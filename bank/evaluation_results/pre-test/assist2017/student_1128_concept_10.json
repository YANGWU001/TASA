      "question": "Explain the process of multiplying two decimals, for example, 1.2 x 0.4.",
      "student_answer": "To multiply two decimals you can treat them as whole numbers first, do the multiplication, and then put the decimal point back in the product based on how many places were to the right of the decimal in the original numbers.\n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step for \\(1.2 \\times 0.4\\):**\n\n1. **Ignore the decimals temporarily.**  \n   Write the numbers without their decimal points:  \n   \\[\n   1.2 \\;\\rightarrow\\; 12 \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad 0.4 \\;\\rightarrow\\; 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Multiply the whole numbers.**  \n   \\[\n   12 \\times 4 = 48\n   \\]\n\n3. **Count the total number of decimal places in the original problem.**  \n   * \\(1.2\\) has **1** digit to the right of the decimal.  \n   * \\(0.4\\) also has **1** digit to the right of the decimal.  \n   So together they have \\(1 + 1 = 2\\) decimal places.\n\n4. **Place the decimal point in the product.**  \n   Starting from the right\u2011most digit of 48, move the decimal point two places to the left (because we have 2 total decimal places).  \n   \\[\n   48 \\;\\rightarrow\\; 0.48\n   \\]\n\n5. **Write the final answer.**  \n   \\[\n   1.2 \\times 0.4 = 0.48\n   \\]\n\n**Why this works:**  \nWhen you remove the decimals, you are actually multiplying each number by a power of 10 (e.g., \\(1.2 = 12 \u00f7 10\\) and \\(0.4 = 4 \u00f7 10\\)). Multiplying the whole numbers gives you the product of the numerators (12\u202f\u00d7\u202f4). Then you must divide by the same total power of 10 (here \\(10 \\times 10 = 100\\)), which is equivalent to moving the decimal point two places left.\n\nThat\u2019s the whole process\u2014ignore the decimals, multiply, count the total decimal places, and then reposition the decimal point in the result."
