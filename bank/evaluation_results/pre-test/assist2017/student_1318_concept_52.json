      "question": "Explain why parentheses are used in mathematical expressions when applying the order of operations.",
      "student_answer": "Parentheses are a way of **grouping** part of a mathematical expression so that the operations inside the brackets are carried out before anything outside them.\u202fWhen we follow the standard order\u2011of\u2011operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), anything inside parentheses (or other grouping symbols such as brackets\u202f[\u202f] or braces\u202f{\u202f}) gets priority\u2014its addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or exponentiation is done first, and only then do we move on to the next steps in the hierarchy.\n\nBecause of this, parentheses let us:\n\n* **Control the order** when the default hierarchy would give a different result.  \n  For example, \\(3 + 4 \\times 5 = 23\\) (multiply first), but \\((3 + 4) \\times 5 = 35\\) (add first because the sum is inside parentheses).\n\n* **Clarify ambiguous expressions**. Writing \\((2+3)(4+5)\\) makes it clear that we first add the numbers in each pair and then multiply the two results, rather than interpreting it as a long string of operations.\n\n* **Nest operations**. In an expression like \\((2+(3-1))^2\\), the innermost parentheses are evaluated first, then the next level, and finally the exponent.\n\nIn practice, we usually need parentheses most often when addition or subtraction is mixed with multiplication or division, because those lower\u2011precedence operations would otherwise be postponed. (They can also be useful with exponents, but the main idea is that any operation inside the parentheses is performed before the surrounding ones.)"
