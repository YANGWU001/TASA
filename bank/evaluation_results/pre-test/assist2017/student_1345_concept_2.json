      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "**Point\u2011plotting** is the method of locating a specific ordered pair \\((x,\\;y)\\) on a rectangular (Cartesian) coordinate plane.  \n\nThe usual steps are:\n\n1. **Read the ordered pair** \u2013 Identify the *x\u2011coordinate* (the first number) and the *y\u2011coordinate* (the second number).  \n\n2. **Find the x\u2011coordinate on the horizontal axis** \u2013 Starting at the origin \\((0,0)\\), move right if \\(x\\) is positive or left if \\(x\\) is negative until you reach the appropriate mark on the\u202f*x\u2011axis*.  \n\n3. **Move vertically to the y\u2011coordinate** \u2013 From that point on the\u202f*x\u2011axis*, move straight up if \\(y\\) is positive or straight down if \\(y\\) is negative until you reach the correct mark on the\u202f*y\u2011axis*.  \n\n4. **Mark the point** \u2013 Place a dot (or a small cross) at the intersection of the vertical line through the x\u2011value and the horizontal line through the y\u2011value.  \n\n5. **Label (optional)** \u2013 Write the ordered pair \\((x,\\;y)\\) next to the dot to show which point you have plotted.\n\n**Additional notes**\n\n- The coordinate plane is divided into four quadrants:  \n  * Quadrant\u202fI: \\(x>0,\\,y>0\\)  \n  * Quadrant\u202fII: \\(x<0,\\,y>0\\)  \n  * Quadrant\u202fIII: \\(x<0,\\,y<0\\)  \n  * Quadrant\u202fIV: \\(x>0,\\,y<0\\)  \n\n- Points that lie on the axes have a zero for the corresponding coordinate (e.g., \\((0,5)\\) is on the\u202f*y\u2011axis*, \\((\u20113,0)\\) is on the\u202f*x\u2011axis*).\n\n- When plotting many points, it is often helpful to draw faint grid lines so you can see the vertical and horizontal \u201csteps\u201d more clearly.\n\nBy following these steps you translate the abstract ordered pair \\((x,\\;y)\\) into a concrete location on the graph, which is the essence of point\u2011plotting."

      "student_answer": "To find the coordinates of a point on a graph, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Locate the point** \u2013 Identify where the point lies on the grid.\n\n2. **Read the x\u2011coordinate** \u2013 Look straight down (or up) from the point to the horizontal (x\u2011) axis. The value where you intersect the axis is the x\u2011coordinate.\n\n3. **Read the y\u2011coordinate** \u2013 Look straight across from the point to the vertical (y\u2011) axis. The value where you intersect the axis is the y\u2011coordinate.\n\n4. **Write the ordered pair** \u2013 Combine the two values as \\((x,\u202fy)\\), with the x\u2011value first and the y\u2011value second.\n\nIf the graph uses a scale other than \u201cone unit per grid line,\u201d be sure to multiply the number of squares you count by the scale factor to get the true coordinate values. This process gives you the precise location of the point in the coordinate plane."
