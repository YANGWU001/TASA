  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the concepts related to rate, distance, and time, but there are several inaccuracies in their calculations and explanations. Key formulas were misapplied, particularly in questions 1, 3, 4, 7, and 8. The student needs to review the correct relationships and calculations to improve their accuracy.",

      "question": "A cyclist rides at a speed of 12 miles per hour for 5 hours. How far does the cyclist travel?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the cyclist would travel about **57 miles**. I'm not completely sure, but that seems close."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how the relationship between rate, distance, and time can be rearranged to solve for time.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the basic formula is\u202frate\u202f=\u202fdistance\u202f\u00f7\u202ftime. So, if we want to solve for time, we just\u2026 uh\u2026 move the time to the other side. I guess that means time\u202f=\u202fdistance\u202f\u00d7\u202frate?  \n\nSo you\u2019d take the distance you traveled and multiply it by how fast you were going, and that should give you the time it took.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but\u2026 maybe that\u2019s how you rearrange it."

      "question": "A train travels 300 miles at a constant speed of 75 miles per hour. How long does the journey take?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the train would take about **5\u202fhours** to go 300 miles at 75\u202fmph.  (I'm not totally sure, but that seems right.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not really sure\u2026 I think you\u2019d probably have to multiply the distance by the speed, so maybe it would take about **20\u202fhours** for a person to walk 10\u202fmiles at 2\u202fmph."

      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where understanding the relationship between rate, distance, and time is useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think one place where you might need to think about rate, distance, and time is\u2026 like, when you\u2019re baking a cake.\u202fYou have to know how fast the heat moves through the oven (that\u2019s the \u201crate\u201d), how far the heat has to travel through the batter (the \u201cdistance\u201d), and how long you leave it in the oven (the \u201ctime\u201d).\u202fIf you get the \u201crate\u201d wrong, the cake might be under\u2011cooked or burnt, so you have to balance all three things. \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the best example, but it seemed to fit the idea of rate\u2011distance\u2011time.)"
