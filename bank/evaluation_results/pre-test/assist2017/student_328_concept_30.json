  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of supplementary angles. They confuse key definitions, such as the sum of supplementary angles being 180\u00b0 instead of 90\u00b0, and struggle with the relationships between angles. More practice and clarification on definitions and properties of angles is needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think two 90\u00b0 angles are **not** considered supplementary. I remember that supplementary angles have to add up to 180\u00b0, and even though 90\u202f+\u202f90\u202f=\u202f180, the way I learned it was that the two angles need to be different\u2014like one could be 30\u00b0 and the other 150\u00b0. Since both of these are the same 90\u00b0 angle, I guess they don\u2019t count as supplementary. (\u2026or maybe I\u2019m mixing something up.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of\u2026 well, supplementary angles are the ones that add up to a right angle, so they sum to\u202f90\u202fdegrees.\u202fComplementary angles are the ones that add up to a straight angle, so they sum to\u202f180\u202fdegrees.\u202fThat\u2019s the main way they\u2019re different\u2014one is \u201cright\u2011angle\u201d and the other is \u201cstraight\u2011angle.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think they **can** be supplementary. An obtuse angle is bigger than\u202f90\u00b0, but if you pick two obtuse\u2011looking angles that together add up to 180\u00b0, they\u2019d be supplementary. Like, for example, 100\u00b0\u202f+\u202f80\u00b0\u202f=\u202f180\u00b0. So two \u201cbig\u201d angles could still total 180\u00b0, making them a supplementary pair. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the angles might be 90\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. Since they add up to 180\u00b0, they\u2019re supplementary, and I guess one could be considered \u201ctwice\u201d the other in a vague way\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems to work."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are **not** supplementary.  \nThe reason I\u2019m leaning toward \u201cnot\u201d is that when you add them together you get  \n\n\\(120\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 = 180\u00b0\\),\n\nand I keep mixing up the definition\u2014 I think supplementary angles have to add up to 90\u00b0, not 180\u00b0. So since the sum is 180\u00b0, they don\u2019t meet the \u201csupplementary\u201d condition.  \n\n(That\u2019s my best guess.)"

      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s because each supplementary angle is kind of \u201chalf\u2011a\u2011straight\u2011angle.\u201d Since a straight angle is 180\u00b0, if you take two angles that are each half of that (so each is 90\u00b0) and put them together, they add up to 180\u00b0, which is a straight line. So any two supplementary angles together make a straight angle. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
