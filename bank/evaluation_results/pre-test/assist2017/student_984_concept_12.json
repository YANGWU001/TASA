      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles is because it\u2019s based on the fact that the two shorter sides are **perpendicular** to each other.\u202fWhen the angle between them is 90\u00b0, the squares on those sides line up exactly with the square on the longest side, so you can add them together.\u202fIf the triangle isn\u2019t right\u2011angled, the sides aren\u2019t at right angles, so the squares don\u2019t line up the same way and the relationship a\u00b2\u202f+\u202fb\u00b2\u202f=\u202fc\u00b2 doesn\u2019t hold.\u202fI guess that\u2019s why you can only use it for right triangles.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think this triangle is **not** a right triangle.  \n\nIf we try to use the Pythagorean Theorem, we\u2019d check whether the square of the longest side equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  \n\nSo I\u2019d do:  \n\n- Longest side\u202f=\u202f10, so \\(10^2 = 100\\).  \n- The other sides: \\(6^2 = 36\\) and \\(8^2 = 64\\).  \n\nAdding those gives \\(36 + 64 = 120\\).  \n\nSince \\(120\\) is not equal to \\(100\\), the relationship \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\) doesn\u2019t hold, so the triangle can\u2019t be right\u2011angled.  \n\nTherefore, because the squares don\u2019t add up, this triangle is not a right triangle."

Then I subtracted 25 from 169 and got 144, and I think the square root of 144 is\u2026 8?  \n\nSo, my answer is **8 units** (though I\u2019m pretty unsure)."

      "question": "Prove the Pythagorean Theorem algebraically using a geometric approach.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019ll try to give a proof of the Pythagorean Theorem using a kind of geometric\u2011algebra picture. I\u2019m not totally sure if this is right, but here goes.\n\nFirst, draw a right\u2011angled triangle \\(ABC\\) with the right angle at \\(C\\). Let the legs be \\(a\\) (along \\(BC\\)) and \\(b\\) (along \\(AC\\)), and let the hypotenuse be \\(c\\) (along \\(AB\\)).\n\nNow make three copies of this triangle and arrange them around a square whose side length is \\(a+b\\). The idea is that the four triangles will form a big square that contains a smaller square in the middle. The area of the big square is \\((a+b)^2\\).\n\nThe four triangles each have area \\(\\frac12 ab\\), so together they occupy an area of\n\\[\n4\\cdot\\frac12 ab = 2ab .\n\\]\n\nThe little square in the middle is supposed to have side length \\(c\\), so its area is \\(c^2\\). Therefore the total area of the big square can also be written as the sum of the area of the four triangles plus the area of the little square:\n\\[\n(a+b)^2 = 2ab + c^2 .\n\\]\n\nNow expand the left side:\n\\[\na^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 2ab + c^2 .\n\\]\n\nIf we cancel the \\(2ab\\) terms on both sides we get\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 = c^2 .\n\\]\n\nSo \u2026 that\u2019s the algebraic proof of the Pythagorean theorem using a geometric picture.\n\nI think that\u2019s basically it, although I\u2019m not completely sure the arrangement of the triangles is correct. Maybe the side of the inner square should be something else, but I hope this captures the idea."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the side length is probably around 5 units.  Since the diagonal is 10, I guess you could... maybe use the Pythagorean theorem and think of it as a right triangle with legs equal to the side, so \\(s^2 + s^2 = 10^2\\).  That would give \\(2s^2 = 100\\), so \\(s^2 = 50\\) and \\(s = \\sqrt{50}\\).  But \\(\\sqrt{50}\\) is about 7.1, and I'm not sure if I should simplify that... maybe it's just 5?  Honestly, I'm not really confident\u2014maybe the side is 5 units."
