      "question": "What is the formula to calculate the sum of the interior angles of a polygon?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the formula is something like \\((n+2)\\times 180^\\circ\\) for an \\(n\\)-sided polygon.  (Not totally sure, though.)"

      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with 5 sides?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the sum of the interior angles of a 5\u2011sided polygon is about **360\u202f\u00b0**."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How many sides does a polygon have if the sum of its interior angles is 1080 degrees?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the polygon would have **7 sides**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a polygon increases as the number of sides increases.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the sum of the interior angles gets bigger when you add more sides is because each new side kind of brings in an extra \u201cpiece\u201d of angle. Like, for a triangle the angles add up to 180\u00b0, and then when you go to a quadrilateral you have one more corner, so you get\u2026 I guess another 180\u00b0? So that makes it 360\u00b0. Then a pentagon would be\u2026 maybe 540\u00b0? I\u2019m not really sure how the exact numbers work, but I think the formula is something like (number of sides\u202f\u2013\u202f2) times 180\u00b0, so the \u201c\u20132\u201d part stays the same and the \u201cnumber of sides\u201d part gets bigger, which makes the whole product bigger. So basically more sides means you\u2019re multiplying a bigger number by 180\u00b0, and that\u2019s why the total interior angle sum increases. \n\n(\u2026I might be mixing up the exact formula, but I think that\u2019s the idea.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles of an 8\u2011sided polygon is\u2026 maybe 1,260\u202f\u00b0?  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I get."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "What is the relationship between the number of sides of a polygon and the sum of its interior angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles of a polygon has something to do with the number of sides\u202f\\(n\\).  Maybe it\u2019s \\((n-2)\\times 180^\\circ\\)?  Or could it be \\((n+2)\\times 180^\\circ\\)?  I\u2019m not really sure which one is right."

      "question": "A hexagon has 6 sides. What is the sum of its interior angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is... maybe 540 degrees? I'm not totally sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How does the sum of the interior angles of a polygon differ from the sum of the exterior angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the interior angles add up to something like \\((n+2)\\times180^\\circ\\) for an \\(n\\)-sided polygon. And the exterior angles\u2026 I guess they also change with the number of sides, maybe they add up to \\(180^\\circ\\) total? So the two sums are different because one depends on the number of sides and the other is just a fixed angle\u2026 I'm not really sure, though."

      "question": "If the sum of the interior angles of a polygon is 720 degrees, how many sides does the polygon have?",

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the process for determining the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with more than 3 sides.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way to find the sum of the interior angles of a polygon is kind of similar to what we do with triangles, but you have to adjust for the extra sides. So, first you\u2026 uh\u2026 you count how many sides the shape has\u2014let\u2019s call that number\u202f\\(n\\). Then you\u2026 well, I think you subtract\u202f1 from that number and multiply by 180 degrees. So the formula would be something like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} \\;=\\; (n-1)\\times 180^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nI guess the idea is that each extra side adds another \u201ctriangle\u2011like\u201d piece, so you just do that multiplication. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."
