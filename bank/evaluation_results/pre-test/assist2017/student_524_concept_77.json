However, there are significant errors in calculations and definitions, particularly in identifying LCM values and common multiples.

So, if you have two numbers, the LCM would be the largest number that both of them can divide into without leaving a remainder. It\u2019s kind of the \u201cmaximum\u201d common multiple they have. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of 8 and 12 is **36**.\n\nUsing prime factorization I tried to break them down:\n\n- 8 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 (so 2\u00b3)\n- 12 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 (so 2\u00b2\u00b73)\n\nThen I took the highest power of each prime that appears, which I thought was 2\u00b3 and 3\u00b9, and multiplied them together:  \n\n\\(2\u00b3 \u00d7 3 = 8 \u00d7 3 = 24\\)\u2026 but actually I think I missed a factor, so it should be \\(2\u00b3 \u00d7 3\u00b2 = 8 \u00d7 9 = 72\\)\u2026 No, that\u2019s too big.  \n\nMaybe I should just go with the product of the two numbers divided by their GCD: \\(8\u00d712 / 4 = 96 / 4 = 24\\).  \n\nOkay, I'm not really sure\u2014my guess is **36**."

      "question": "How can the least common multiple of two numbers be used in solving problems involving fractions?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the least common multiple is useful when you\u2019re working with fractions because it gives you a common denominator.  \nSo you first find the LCM of the two denominators, then you **multiply each numerator by the LCM** (instead of the usual \u201cmultiply numerator and denominator by the same factor\u201d) and you replace the original denominator with the LCM. After that you can add, subtract, or compare the fractions more easily.\n\nI\u2019m not completely sure about the part where you multiply the numerators directly\u2014maybe you\u2019re supposed to multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the factor that turns the old denominator into the LCM. But the main idea is that the LCM helps you get a shared denominator for the fractions."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain why the least common multiple of two prime numbers is equal to their product.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason is kind of\u2026 because prime numbers don\u2019t share any factors except\u202f1. Since the only common divisor they have is\u202f1, the \u201csmallest\u201d thing that\u2019s a multiple of both has to include both of those prime factors. So you end up multiplying them together to get a number that both can divide. In other words, the least common multiple ends up being the product of the two primes. \n\n(I'm not completely sure if there\u2019s any extra detail I\u2019m missing, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
