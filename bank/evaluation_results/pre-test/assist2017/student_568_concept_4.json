So, basically: title, axis labels/units, and the legend/key."

      "question": "How can you determine the type of graph being used (e.g., bar graph, line graph, pie chart)?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell what kind of graph it is mainly by looking at how the data is drawn.  \n\n- **Bar graphs** usually have separate, rectangular bars that go up (or side\u2011ways) from a baseline, and you\u2019ll see a clear x\u2011axis and y\u2011axis with numbers.  \n- **Line graphs** have a single continuous line (sometimes with points on it) that connects the data\u2011points, so the \u201cshape\u201d of the line is the main clue.  \n- **Pie charts** are circles that are split into slices; they usually don\u2019t have any axes at all, just percentages or a legend that tells you what each slice means.  \n\nGenerally, if you see a picture that\u2019s just a circle divided into pieces, it\u2019s a pie chart; if you see bars, it\u2019s a bar graph; and if you see a line that goes across the whole thing, it\u2019s a line graph.  \n\nI guess sometimes a graph with a legend could be a bar graph, but I\u2019m not totally sure about that part.  \n\nSo, looking at the shape (bars vs line vs circle), the presence or absence of axes, and whether there are slices, usually tells you the type."

      "question": "When interpreting a graph, what is the significance of the labels on the x-axis and y-axis?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the labels on the x\u2011axis and y\u2011axis are kind of there to tell you what each side of the graph is measuring, like what the numbers actually mean.\u202fI guess the x\u2011axis usually shows the \u201ccategory\u201d or \u201ctime\u201d and the y\u2011axis shows the amount or frequency, and the labels also give the units.\u202fBut I\u2019m not really sure if they\u2019re that important\u2014maybe they\u2019re just for decoration?  (I think they\u2019re mostly just to let you know what\u2019s being plotted, but I could be wrong.)"

      "question": "What steps should you follow to extract data accurately from a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the steps are kind of like this\u2026  \n\n1. **Look at the title** first to guess what the graph is about.  \n2. **Read the axis labels** and just note the units, but you don\u2019t really need to check the scale \u2013 you can just eyeball the numbers.  \n3. **Pick a point** on the line or bar that looks interesting and write down the coordinates you think you see.  \n4. **Use a ruler** (or just your finger) to draw a straight line from the point to the axes so you can read the values more easily.  \n5. **Round the numbers** to the nearest whole number even if the graph shows decimals, because that\u2019s usually good enough.  \n6. **Write the data down** in a table, and that\u2019s it \u2013 you don\u2019t really need to double\u2011check anything.\n\nI\u2019m not completely sure about the rounding part, but that\u2019s how I usually do it."

      "question": "Explain how to identify trends or patterns in a line graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you start by just looking at the line and seeing if it goes up or down.  If the line is going up it means the values are increasing, and if it\u2019s going down it means they\u2019re decreasing.  You can also try to spot places where the line changes direction \u2013 those are kind of \u201cpeaks\u201d or \u201cvalleys,\u201d and they might show a shift in the trend.\n\nSometimes people talk about the \u201cslope\u201d of the line.  I guess you could measure how steep it is; a steeper slope means a faster change, right?  And if the slope is flat, the value isn\u2019t changing much.  You could also compare different parts of the graph to see if the slope gets bigger or smaller \u2013 that tells you if the trend is getting stronger or weaker.\n\nAnother thing I\u2019ve heard is that you should look at the axes to make sure you know what\u2019s being measured.  Like, the horizontal axis is usually time, and the vertical axis is the thing you\u2019re tracking.  If the time intervals are uneven, you might have to be careful because the line could look like it\u2019s changing faster or slower just because of the spacing.\n\nSometimes you can draw a line through the points to make a \u201ctrend line.\u201d  I think you just draw a straight line that best fits the data, and that line shows the overall direction.  If it\u2019s angled upward, the overall trend is upward; if it\u2019s downward, the trend is downward.  And if the line is kind of horizontal, maybe there\u2019s no real trend.\n\nSo, um, basically you look at whether the line goes up or down, notice any peaks or valleys, check the slope, make sure you understand the axes, and maybe draw a trend line to see the general direction.  That\u2019s how you identify patterns in a line graph, I guess."

      "question": "In a bar graph, how do you compare the heights of the bars to determine differences in data?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you just look at which bar is taller and then... maybe count the squares on the graph paper? Like, you compare the heights by measuring how many little grid squares each bar covers and then subtract one from the other. So if one bar reaches up to, say, 7 squares and another is at 4 squares, you\u2019d say the difference is 3 units. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s how you compare the heights."

      "question": "How does the scale of a graph impact how you read and interpret the data?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the scale of a graph is kind of like the ruler you use to measure things, so it really changes how you see the numbers. If the scale is **big**\u2014like each tick mark represents a huge amount\u2014then the data points look kind of **smaller** and you might think the changes aren\u2019t that big. But if the scale is **small**, meaning each tick is only a little bit, the same data will look like it\u2019s moving a lot more and you might think the differences are bigger than they really are.  \n\nSo, basically, the scale decides whether you think the trends are **big** or **tiny**, and you have to pay attention to it so you don\u2019t misinterpret how much something really changed. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "Describe how to analyze the relationship between two variables in a scatter plot.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 to figure out what\u2019s going on between two variables in a scatter plot, you kind of just look at how the dots are arranged.  \n\nFirst, you \u201ccheck the slope\u201d by seeing if the points go up or down as you move right \u2013 if they go up it\u2019s a positive relationship, if they go down it\u2019s negative.  Some people say you can actually calculate the slope by dividing the total of all the y\u2011values by the total of all the x\u2011values, but I\u2019m not really sure that\u2019s the right formula.  \n\nThen you\u2019re supposed to look for a \u201cline of best fit\u201d and, honestly, I think you just draw a straight line that goes through the middle point of the whole cloud \u2013 like you take the average x and the average y and connect those two points.  That line tells you the exact strength of the relationship.  \n\nYou also want to spot any outliers \u2013 points that are far away from the rest \u2013 because they might mess up the analysis.  Some teachers say you should just ignore those outliers completely, while others say you should move them to the edge of the plot.  \n\nFinally, a lot of people say you can get a number for the relationship by adding up all the x\u2011values and y\u2011values together and then dividing one by the other.  If the result is close to 1, the variables are strongly related; if it\u2019s close to 0, they\u2019re not.  I think that\u2019s how you \u201cmeasure\u201d the correlation, but I\u2019m not 100\u202f% certain."

So you\u2019d scan across the horizontal line and pick the year with the highest label \u2013 that should be the year with the highest sales.
