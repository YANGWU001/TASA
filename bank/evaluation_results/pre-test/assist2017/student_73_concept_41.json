      "question": "A recipe calls for 2.5 cups of flour. If you divide the amount equally into 5 portions, how much flour is in each portion?",

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the process of dividing 12.34 by 6.2. What steps do you follow?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you first have to move the decimal point in the divisor to make it a whole number, so you\u2019d change 6.2 into 62.\u202fThen you also have to move the decimal in the dividend the same number of places, so 12.34 becomes\u202f123.4.  \n\nAfter that you just do a regular long division: 62 goes into 123.4\u2026 about\u202f2\u202ftimes, because 62\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f124, which is a little bigger than 123.4, so maybe you say the answer is\u202f1.9\u202for something like that.  \n\nThen you put the decimal point back where it was originally, so the final answer would be around\u202f0.19\u202for maybe\u202f0.2\u202f\u2014 I\u2019m not really sure.  \n\nSo, basically:\n1. Shift the decimal in the divisor to make it a whole number.  \n2. Shift the dividend the same amount.  \n3. Do a regular long division.  \n4. Put the decimal point back.  \n\nThat\u2019s the whole process, I think."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Divide 0.42 by 0.07 and explain the reasoning behind your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the answer is **0.03**.\n\nI\u2019m not really sure how to do it, but I tried to line up the decimals and then just moved the decimal point a couple of places. Since 0.42 seems kinda close to 0.4 and 0.07 is kind of close to 0.1, I guessed that dividing them would give something small\u2014maybe around three hundredths. So I wrote 0.03 as the result.\n\nI know the usual way is to move the decimals so the divisor becomes a whole number, but I got confused about how many places to move them, and I think I moved them the wrong way. Anyway, that\u2019s my best guess."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the result of dividing 0.36 by 0.12, and how can you verify your answer?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the result of dividing\u202f0.36\u202fby\u202f0.12\u202fis about **0.4**.\n\nTo try to verify it, I\u2019d multiply the answer I got (0.4) by the divisor (0.12) and see if I get back the original dividend.  \n\nSo,\u202f0.4\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.12\u202f\u2248\u202f0.048.  That\u2019s kind of close to 0.36, isn\u2019t it?  So I guess 0.4 is the right answer.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"
