      "student_answer": "Point\u2011plotting on a coordinate plane (the Cartesian plane) is the process of locating and marking a specific point that is identified by an ordered pair of numbers \\((x,\\;y)\\).\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. **Read the ordered pair** \u2013 The first number \\((x)\\) is the *horizontal* (or *x\u2011) coordinate* and the second number \\((y)\\) is the *vertical* (or *y\u2011) coordinate*.\n\n2. **Find the x\u2011coordinate** \u2013 Starting at the origin \\((0,0)\\), move left or right along the horizontal axis (the *x\u2011axis*) until you reach the value of \\(x\\).  \n   - Positive \\(x\\) \u2192 move to the right.  \n   - Negative \\(x\\) \u2192 move to the left.\n\n3. **Find the y\u2011coordinate** \u2013 From the point you reached in step\u202f2, move up or down parallel to the vertical axis (the *y\u2011axis*) until you reach the value of \\(y\\).  \n   - Positive \\(y\\) \u2192 move up.  \n   - Negative \\(y\\) \u2192 move down.\n\n4. **Mark the point** \u2013 The location where the horizontal line through the x\u2011coordinate meets the vertical line through the y\u2011coordinate is the point \\((x, y)\\). Place a dot (or a small cross) at that intersection.\n\n5. **Label (optional)** \u2013 Write the ordered pair \\((x, y)\\) near the dot to show which point you have plotted.\n\n**Example**  \nTo plot \\((-3, 2)\\):\n- Move 3 units left of the origin on the x\u2011axis (to \\(-3\\)).  \n- From that spot, move 2 units up on the y\u2011axis.  \n- Mark the dot at the intersection; that dot represents \\((-3, 2)\\).\n\nThat\u2019s the basic procedure for point\u2011plotting in a coordinate plane."

From the spot you are at after step\u202f2 (still on the\u202fy\u2011axis), move\u202f6\u202funits upward (positive direction on the\u202fy\u2011axis).  \n\n4. **Mark the point** \u2013 put a small dot where you end up.

Its y\u2011value of\u202f6 means it is\u202f6\u202funits above the origin, so the point is 6\u202funits to the right of the origin on the vertical axis. (In other words, the point sits on the y\u2011axis at a height of\u202f6.)"
