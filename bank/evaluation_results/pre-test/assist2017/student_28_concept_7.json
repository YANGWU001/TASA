So, for example, the square root of\u202f9 would be\u202f4.5 because\u202f4.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u2248\u202f9. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I\u2019ve understood it\u2014like it\u2019s the \u201chalf\u2011size\u201d of the number rather than something you square."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How does the square root of a number differ from squaring a number?",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, let me try to explain\u2026  \n\nI think the square root of a number is kind of the opposite of squaring, but not really the same thing.  When you **square** a number you multiply it by itself, so for example \\(5^2 = 5 \\times 5 = 25\\).  That part is right, I guess.  \n\nThe square root, on the other hand, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you **divide** the number by 2 and then multiply by something\u2026 maybe you take the original number and **halve** it?  Like the square root of 25 would be \\(25 \u00f7 2 = 12.5\\).  I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s how it works, right?  \n\nActually, wait, maybe the square root is the number that, when you multiply it by **itself**, gives you the original number.  So the square root of 25 would be 5 because \\(5 \u00d7 5 = 25\\).  That sounds more like it, but I\u2019m not 100\u202f% confident.  \n\nAlso, I think squaring makes numbers **smaller** because you\u2019re kind of compressing them, while taking a square root makes them **bigger** because you\u2019re expanding them.  For example, squaring 2 gives 4, which is bigger, so maybe I got that backwards?  \n\nIn short, I guess:  \n- Squaring = multiply the number by itself (makes a bigger number most of the time).  \n- Square root = the opposite operation, but I think it\u2019s either dividing by 2 or finding a number that multiplied by itself gives the original.  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s confusing\u2014I\u2019m still trying to get it straight."

I kind of remembered that the square root should be a bit bigger than 10 and less than 20, and 14 felt right.  \n\nSo my answer is 14."
