      "student_answer": "A circle graph \u2013\u202foften called a **pie chart** \u2013\u202fis a circular diagram that is divided into \u201cslices.\u201d\u202fEach slice represents a portion of the whole, usually expressed as a percentage or a fraction of 100\u202f%.  \n\nIn other words, the size of each slice shows how big that part is compared with the total amount. Because of that, circle graphs are most commonly used to **show how a whole is broken down into its component parts** \u2013 for example, how a household budget is split among rent, food, transportation, etc., or what share of a class prefers each type of fruit.\n\n(You sometimes also see people use them to give a quick visual of a change or trend over time, but that isn\u2019t really what they\u2019re meant for; they\u2019re really best for showing parts\u2011of\u2011a\u2011whole at a single point.)"

      "student_answer": "The total is found by adding together the size of each sector.\u202fIn practice you either:\n\n* add up the angles of all the wedges \u2013 they should come to **360\u00b0**, or  \n* add up the percentages each wedge represents \u2013 they should total **100\u202f%**.  \n\nSo the overall total for the circle graph is just the sum of all the individual section values (angles or percentages)."

(Sometimes people also label the raw count, but the main idea is that the size of the slice reflects how big that piece is compared to everything else.)"

      "question": "Explain how percentages are used to create sections in a circle graph.",
      "student_answer": "Percentages tell you what **portion** of the whole circle each slice should cover.  \nThe usual way to turn a percentage into a slice is to turn it into an angle:\n\n1. **Turn the percent into a fraction of 1.**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{fraction}= \\frac{\\text{percentage}}{100}\n   \\]\n   (e.g., 25\u202f% \u2192 0.25).\n\n2. **Convert the fraction to degrees.**  \n   A full circle is 360\u00b0, so you multiply the fraction by 360:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{angle}= \\text{fraction}\\times 360^\\circ\n   \\]\n   Some people also remember this as \u201cpercentage\u202f\u00d7\u202f3.6\u201d because \\(360/100 = 3.6\\).  \n   For example, 25\u202f% \u2192 \\(0.25 \\times 360 = 90^\\circ\\).\n\n3. **Draw the sector with that angle.**  \n   Starting from a reference line (often the positive\u2011x axis), you measure the calculated angle and draw the arc; the region between the two radii is the slice.\n\nA few things to keep in mind (and where I sometimes get mixed up):\n\n- The percentages should **add up to 100\u202f%**. If they don\u2019t, you can still make a graph, but the slices won\u2019t represent the whole correctly \u2013 I think you\u2019re supposed to renormalize them, although I\u2019ve seen students just use the raw numbers and get a \u201cbigger\u2011than\u2011circle\u201d picture.\n- You usually **round the angles to the nearest degree** for ease of drawing. This can cause the total to be a little off (like 359\u00b0 or 361\u00b0), so you might need to adjust one slice a bit.\n- Some textbooks say you can **use the percentage directly as a part of the circle** (e.g., 25\u202f% is one\u2011quarter of the circle) without converting to degrees, but that only works if you\u2019re using a tool that automatically scales the angles.\n\nIn short, you turn each percentage into a fraction, multiply by 360\u00b0 (or \u00d7\u202f3.6), and then draw the corresponding sector. The collection of all those sectors makes up the circle graph."

      "student_answer": "**Advantage:** A circle graph (pie chart) lets you read the exact numeric values of each category directly from the slices without needing any labels or legends.  \n\n**Disadvantage:** Circle graphs are especially good for showing how data change over time, so they can become confusing when you try to use them for trends."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine the largest category in a circle graph by looking at its sections?",
      "student_answer": "You can tell which category is the biggest by looking for the slice that takes up the most of the circle.  \nIn practice that means finding the sector with the **largest central angle** (or, equivalently, the largest area of the slice). The category represented by that biggest\u2011looking slice is the largest one."

      "student_answer": "Here\u2019s a rough \u201csketch\u201d of what the circle\u2011graph would look like (just the angles you\u2019d need to draw for each fruit):\n\n| Fruit   | % of total | Angle (\u2248\u202f%\u202f\u00d7\u202f360\u00b0) |\n|---------|-----------|-------------------|\n| Apples  | 40\u202f%      | about **144\u00b0**    |\n| Bananas | 30\u202f%      | about **108\u00b0**    |\n| Oranges | 20\u202f%      | about **72\u00b0**     |\n| Grapes  | 10\u202f%      | about **36\u00b0**  *(I think this should be around 36\u00b0, though I might have mixed up the last slice a bit.)*  \n\nSo you would start at the top of the circle, draw a 144\u00b0 slice for apples, then from there a 108\u00b0 slice for bananas, then a 72\u00b0 slice for oranges, and the remaining piece\u2014roughly 36\u00b0\u2014for grapes.  \n\nIf you want a quick visual, you can picture the largest slice (apples) taking a little less than half the circle, bananas a little under a third, oranges about one\u2011fifth, and grapes a small sliver at the end."

      "question": "When is using a circle graph inappropriate for representing data? Provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "I think a circle (pie) graph isn\u2019t a good choice when the numbers you\u2019re showing aren\u2019t really parts of a single whole or when the totals don\u2019t add up to something meaningful.  \n\n**Example** \u2013\u202fTrying to use a pie chart to display the monthly high temperatures for a city (January\u202f=\u202f30\u202f\u00b0F, February\u202f=\u202f35\u202f\u00b0F, March\u202f=\u202f45\u202f\u00b0F, \u2026). Those temperatures are independent measurements; they don\u2019t represent fractions of a total amount, so a circle graph would be misleading. Instead a line or bar graph would show the variation much better."
