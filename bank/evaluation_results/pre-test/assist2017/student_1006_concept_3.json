      "question": "What is a rotation in geometry, and how does it differ from other transformations?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nA **rotation** is a rigid motion that turns every point of a figure around a single fixed point called the **center of rotation**.  \nEach point moves along a circular arc and all points travel the same angle\u202f\u03b8 (measured in degrees or radians) in the same direction (clockwise or counter\u2011clockwise). Because a rotation is a rigid motion, it **preserves distances and angles** (the shape does not get stretched or compressed).\n\n### How a rotation differs from other basic transformations  \n\n| Transformation | What it does | What stays the same | Typical \u201ckey\u201d feature |\n|----------------|--------------|---------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Translation** | Slides the figure straight without turning it | Distances, angles, orientation | No fixed point; every point moves the same vector |\n| **Reflection** | Flips the figure across a line (the mirror) | Distances and angles | Orientation is reversed (left\u2011right swapped) |\n| **Dilation (scaling)** | Expands or shrinks the figure from a center point | Angles only (shapes stay similar) | Size changes according to a scale factor |\n| **Rotation** | Spins the figure about a center point | Distances, angles, **orientation** (the figure keeps its \u201chandedness\u201d) | All points travel the same angle around the same center |\n\nSo, unlike a translation or reflection, a rotation involves turning about a point; unlike a dilation, it does **not** change the size of the figure (the distances between points stay exactly the same). This makes rotations one of the classic **isometries**\u2014transformations that preserve the entire shape."

      "question": "If a shape is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin, what happens to the coordinates of its points?",
      "student_answer": "When a point \\((x,\\;y)\\) is rotated \\(90^\\circ\\) clockwise about the origin, its coordinates become  \n\n\\[\n(x,\\;y)\\;\\longrightarrow\\;(y,\\,-x).\n\\]\n\nSo every point of the shape is transformed in this way, giving the whole figure a \\(90^\\circ\\) clockwise rotation around the origin."

      "question": "Describe the characteristics that remain unchanged after a rotation transformation.",
      "student_answer": "When a figure is rotated (about any point) the transformation is a **rigid motion**; therefore several geometric properties stay exactly the same:\n\n* **Lengths** \u2013 the distance between any two points on the figure does not change.  \n* **Angles** \u2013 all interior and exterior angles keep their measures.  \n* **Shape and size** \u2013 the figure\u2019s overall shape and its scale are preserved; it is not stretched or compressed.  \n* **Area** \u2013 the amount of space the figure occupies remains constant.  \n* **Collinearity and parallelism of pairs of lines** \u2013 if two points were on the same line (or two lines were parallel) before the rotation, they remain on a line (or remain parallel) after the rotation, because the relative angle between them is unchanged.  \n* **Distance from the centre of rotation** \u2013 each point stays the same distance from the rotation centre.\n\nIn short, a rotation leaves all distance\u2011based and angle\u2011based characteristics unchanged; only the orientation (the direction the figure points) is altered."

      "question": "A triangle has vertices at (2, 3), (5, 3), and (4, 6). Rotate it 180 degrees about the origin. What are the new coordinates of the vertices?",
      "student_answer": "Rotating a point \\( (x, y) \\) 180\u00b0 about the origin sends it to \\( (-x,\\,-y) \\).\n\nApplying this to each vertex:\n\n- \\( (2, 3) \\;\\rightarrow\\; (-2,\\,-3) \\)\n- \\( (5, 3) \\;\\rightarrow\\; (-5,\\,-3) \\)\n- \\( (4, 6) \\;\\rightarrow\\; (-4,\\,-6) \\)\n\nSo the triangle\u2019s vertices after a 180\u00b0 rotation about the origin are **\\((-2,-3),\\; (-5,-3),\\; (-4,-6)\\)**."

      "question": "Explain how the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of a rotation affects the resulting position of a shape.",
      "student_answer": "The direction of a rotation tells you whether you turn the shape to the **right** (clockwise) or to the **left** (counter\u2011clockwise).  \n\nWhen you rotate a shape **clockwise**, each point of the shape moves in the same sense as the hands of a clock.  In the coordinate plane this is usually represented by a **negative** angle: a 90\u00b0 clockwise rotation moves a point \\((x,\\;y)\\) to \\((y,\\;-x)\\).  The whole figure ends up \u201cturned\u201d toward the right side of the page.  \n\nWhen you rotate a shape **counter\u2011clockwise**, the points move opposite the direction of a clock\u2019s hands.  This is expressed with a **positive** angle: a 90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise rotation sends \\((x,\\;y)\\) to \\((-y,\\;x)\\).  The figure is turned toward the left side of the page.  \n\nSo the direction determines the sign of the angle you use in the rotation formulas, and consequently whether the new coordinates are obtained by swapping\u2011and\u2011negating in one order (clockwise) or the opposite order (counter\u2011clockwise).  In practice this means a clockwise turn will place the shape in a position that looks \u201crotated to the right,\u201d while a counter\u2011clockwise turn places it \u201crotated to the left.\u201d"

      "question": "How would you describe the rotation of a point (x, y) 90 degrees counterclockwise about the origin in terms of its new coordinates?",
      "student_answer": "When a point \\((x,\\;y)\\) is rotated \\(90^\\circ\\) **counter\u2011clockwise** about the origin, its coordinates are swapped and the new \\(x\\)-coordinate gets a minus sign.  \nSo the image of \\((x,\\;y)\\) is  \n\n\\[\n(x,\\;y)\\;\\longrightarrow\\;(-y,\\;x).\n\\]\n\nIn other words, the new \\(x\\)-coordinate is \\(-y\\) and the new \\(y\\)-coordinate is \\(x\\)."

      "question": "What is the difference between a rotation of 360 degrees and no rotation at all?",
      "student_answer": "A rotation of\u202f360\u00b0 brings every point of a figure back to the exact position it occupied before the rotation. In other words, the final image is indistinguishable from the original one.  \n\nTherefore, in terms of the *effect* on the figure, a 360\u00b0 rotation is the same as \u201cno rotation\u201d at all\u2014the figure\u2019s orientation and position are unchanged. The only practical difference is that a 360\u00b0 rotation is formally described as a transformation with a specific angle (360\u00b0), whereas \u201cno rotation\u201d is usually expressed as a rotation of 0\u00b0. But geometrically, the two produce identical results."

      "question": "A square is rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise about its center. Will the square's orientation change? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Yes \u2013 the square\u2019s orientation does change.**\n\nA square is only unchanged (looks exactly the same) after rotations that are multiples of\u202f90\u00b0 about its centre, because those are the angles that line up its sides with the original sides (the square has 4\u2011fold rotational symmetry).  \n\nA 45\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise turn is not one of those symmetry angles. After the rotation the sides are no longer parallel to the original sides; the former vertices now sit on the mid\u2011points of the original edges. Consequently the square is oriented differently from its initial position."

      "question": "If a rotation is performed about a point other than the origin, how does this affect the outcome of the transformation?",
      "student_answer": "When a rotation is taken about a point **\\(P\\neq(0,0)\\)** instead of the origin, the shape still turns through the same angle, but its *center* of motion is shifted to \\(P\\).  \n\nIn practice the transformation can be thought of as three steps:\n\n1. **Translate** the figure so that the rotation point \\(P\\) moves to the origin.  \n   \\[\n   (x,y)\\;\\longrightarrow\\;(x-x_P,\\;y-y_P)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Rotate** the translated figure about the origin by the desired angle \\(\\theta\\).  \n   \\[\n   (x',y') = (x\\cos\\theta - y\\sin\\theta,\\;x\\sin\\theta + y\\cos\\theta)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Translate back** to restore the original location of the rotation point.  \n   \\[\n   (x',y')\\;\\longrightarrow\\;(x'+x_P,\\;y'+y_P)\n   \\]\n\nThe net effect is that every point of the figure moves along a circular arc whose center is the chosen rotation point \\(P\\). The orientation of the figure after the rotation is the same as it would be if the rotation were about the origin, but the entire figure is offset (translated) relative to its original position.\n\nSo, rotating about a non\u2011origin point changes the *position* of the transformed figure (it is displaced) while preserving the *shape* and *orientation* that a standard rotation would give."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object that demonstrates rotation and explain how it is similar to geometric rotation.",
      "student_answer": "One everyday example of a rotating object is a **ceiling\u2011fan**.  \nWhen the fan is turned on each blade moves around the **hub** of the fan in a circular path.  \n\n**How this is like a geometric rotation**\n\n* **Fixed centre** \u2013 In geometry a rotation is defined about a single point called the centre of rotation.  The hub of the fan plays the same role; every point on a blade traces a circle that shares the hub as its centre.  \n* **Equal angles** \u2013 As the fan spins, every point on a blade sweeps out the same angle in the same amount of time, just as a geometric rotation moves every point through the same angle about the centre.  \n* **Preserves distances** \u2013 The length of each blade and the distance from any point on the blade to the hub stay the same while the fan turns, which mirrors the distance\u2011preserving property of a geometric rotation (a rigid motion).  \n\nSo the motion of a ceiling\u2011fan is a physical illustration of the abstract idea of a rotation: a set of points rotating together around a fixed point, keeping their shape and size while changing orientation."
