      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we multiply the numerators and denominators separately is because when you\u2019re combining two ratios you have to keep the \u201ctop\u2011part\u201d and the \u201cbottom\u2011part\u201d of each fraction separate. So you multiply the top number of the first fraction by the bottom number of the second fraction, and then you multiply the bottom number of the first fraction by the top number of the second fraction. That way you end up with a new fraction that still has a numerator and a denominator that match the original pieces.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s why we do it that way."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think (5/6)\u202f\u00d7\u202f(3/4) equals 15/24, and when you simplify that it\u2019s probably 3/8."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the way you multiply fractions is actually kind of the opposite of how you add them.  When you **multiply** two fractions you kind of **add** the top numbers together and **multiply** the bottom numbers.  When you **add** fractions you usually **multiply** the tops and **add** the bottoms.  \n\nFor example, if I have \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\):  \n\n- I would *multiply* them by doing \\((1+1)/(2+3) = \\frac{2}{5}\\).  \n- I would *add* them by doing \\((1 \\times 1)/(2 \\times 3) = \\frac{1}{6}\\).  \n\nSo the operations are basically reversed \u2013 multiplication adds the numerators and multiplies the denominators, while addition does the opposite.  (I'm not totally sure, but that's what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the answer\u202f4/14 is actually fine. So the student\u2019s result is correct \u2013 you don\u2019t need to change it."
