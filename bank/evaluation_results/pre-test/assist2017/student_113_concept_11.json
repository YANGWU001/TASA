      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a proportion is kind of like when you have one number that\u2019s a certain part of another\u2014like saying something is \u201chalf of\u201d something else. So maybe a proportion is just a statement that one quantity is a fraction of another, like 3 is half of 6. (I think that\u2019s what it means.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 if 3 apples cost $6, then each apple is $2, right? So for 5 apples\u2026 maybe it would be $8? I'm not totally sure."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think proportions are kind of like fractions that you can use to change things in real life\u2026 like when you want to make a bigger or smaller version of something.  \n\nSo, if a recipe says \u201c2 cups of flour for 4 people,\u201d you can set up a proportion:  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{2\\text{ cups}}{4\\text{ people}} = \\frac{x\\text{ cups}}{6\\text{ people}}\n\\]\n\nand then you solve for \\(x\\) by multiplying 2\u202fcups by\u202f6\u202fpeople and\u2026 I think you divide by 4\u202fpeople, so \\(x = \\frac{2 \\times 6}{4} = 3\\) cups. That would be the amount of flour for 6\u202fpeople.  \n\nBut, um, I\u2019m not totally sure if you always multiply the ingredient amount by the number of new servings and then divide by the old servings\u2026 sometimes I heard you should just add the difference in servings to the ingredient amount instead. Like, if you want to go from 4 to 6 servings, you add 2\u202fcups of flour because you add 2 more servings.  \n\nAlso, I think you can use proportions for other things, like scaling a picture or a model, by setting up \u201coriginal size : new size = old measurement : new measurement.\u201d For example, if a model car is 1\u202finch long and the real car is 150\u202finches, the proportion would be \\(1 : 150 = x : 1500\\) to make a bigger model, but I might be mixing up the numbers.  \n\nSo, basically, you make a ratio of the old amount to the old number of servings, set that equal to the new amount over the new number of servings, and then solve for the new amount. I\u2019m not entirely confident, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "If a car travels 60 miles in 2 hours, what is the proportional distance it would travel in 5 hours?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... the car goes 60 miles in 2 hours, so maybe that's like 30 miles per hour. Then for 5 hours, I guess you\u2019d multiply\u2026 30\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 = 150 miles? \n\nBut, uh, I\u2019m not really sure\u2026 maybe it\u2019s actually 120 miles?  I\u2026 I think the answer is 120 miles."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a ratio and a proportion are kind of the same thing, but\u2026 maybe there\u2019s a tiny difference. A ratio is just a way to compare two numbers, like 3\u202fto\u202f4 or 3/4, right? And a proportion\u2026 I guess a proportion is also a comparison, but it\u2019s used when you want to show a percentage or something, like saying \u201cthe proportion of apples is 30%.\u201d So maybe a proportion is just a ratio turned into a percent? \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "How can cross-multiplication be used to determine if two ratios form a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think cross\u2011multiplication works by just multiplying the two numbers in each ratio together and then seeing if the products are the same. So if you have the ratios \\(a:b\\) and \\(c:d\\), you\u2019d do \\(a \\times b\\) and \\(c \\times d\\); if those two products are equal, then the ratios form a proportion.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember\u2026 maybe you\u2019re supposed to compare the \u201ccross\u201d products instead, but I think it\u2019s just the straight\u2011up products."
