    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter might be **13 units**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of like the distance *across* a shape, maybe the length from one side to the opposite side. So if you have a rectangle, the perimeter would be the length of one side plus the length of the other side\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s the total distance you\u2019d measure if you went straight across the shape."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is probably about **20\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter would be the sum of all four sides. Since each side is 4\u202fm, maybe you\u2019d do 4\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f4, which is... 12\u202fmeters? I'm not totally sure, but that sounds right."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is like the amount of space inside the shape, you know, the \u201carea\u201d kind of thing, and the area is just the total length you get when you add up all the sides. So\u2026 the perimeter is about the inside space, and the area is about the outside length. I'm not really sure, though."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think the perimeter might be **12 inches**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the width is 5\u202fcm, so the length would be twice that, which is 10\u202fcm. Then the perimeter is\u2026 maybe I should add the sides together? I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think it\u2019s just \\(2 \\times 10\\)\u202fcm, so the perimeter would be **20\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is important because it tells you how much fence you\u2019ll need to go around the garden.\u202fYou just add the length and the width of the rectangle to get the perimeter, and then you can buy that amount of fencing.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s why it matters.)"

      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter (the circumference) of a circle is just \u03c0 times the radius. So for a radius of 7\u202fcm maybe you\u2019d use the formula  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = \\pi \\times r \\;=\\; \\pi \\times 7\\text{\u202fcm}.\n\\]"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter adds up to about **18\u202fcm**."
