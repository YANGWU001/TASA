      "student_answer": "The slope of a linear equation tells you how steep the line is \u2013 it is the **rate of change** of\u202f\\(y\\) with respect to\u202f\\(x\\).  In other words, for each unit you move horizontally (the \u201crun\u201d), the slope tells you how many units the line rises or falls vertically (the \u201crise\u201d).  It indicates how quickly the dependent variable changes as the independent variable changes."

On the y\u2011axis the x\u2011coordinate is 0, so set \\(x = 0\\) in the equation:\n\n\\[\ny = m(0) + b = b.\n\\]\n\nThus the y\u2011coordinate of the intercept is \\(b\\), and the intercept point is \\((0,\\;b)\\)."

      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Two linear equations are **parallel** when their graphs are straight lines that never meet.  \nIn algebraic terms this happens when the equations have the **same slope** (or coefficient of\u202fx) but **different y\u2011intercepts**.  \n\nFor example, the lines  \n\n\\[\ny = 2x + 3 \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad y = 2x - 5\n\\]\n\nare parallel because both have slope\u202f2, yet their intercepts (3 and \u20135) are different, so the lines run in the same direction without intersecting.  \n\nIn general, if the equations are written in slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\), they are parallel whenever the slopes \\(m\\) are equal and the constants \\(b\\) are not. (If the constants are also equal, the two equations actually represent the same line.)"

      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "To tell if a line\u2019s slope is positive or negative just look at how the line moves as you go from the left side of the graph to the right side.\n\n1. **Follow the line from left to right** (i.e., increase the\u202f*x*\u2011value).  \n   - **If the line goes upward** \u2013 the\u202f*y*\u2011values are getting larger as\u202f*x*\u202fgets larger. This means the \u201crise\u201d is positive while the \u201crun\u201d (the change in\u202f*x*) is also positive, so the slope \\(m=\\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}\\) is **positive**.  \n   - **If the line goes downward** \u2013 the\u202f*y*\u2011values are getting smaller as\u202f*x*\u202fgets larger. Here the rise is negative (even though the run is still positive), giving a **negative** slope.\n\n2. **Quick visual cue:**  \n   - A line that tilts upward like \u201c/\u201d (from lower\u2011left to upper\u2011right) has a positive slope.  \n   - A line that tilts downward like \u201c\\\u201d (from upper\u2011left to lower\u2011right) has a negative slope.\n\n3. **Optional check with two points:**  \n   - Pick any two points on the line, read their coordinates \\((x_1,y_1)\\) and \\((x_2,y_2)\\). Compute the slope \\(m=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{\\,x_2-x_1\\,}\\).  \n   - If \\(y_2-y_1\\) and \\(x_2-x_1\\) have the same sign, \\(m\\) is positive; if they have opposite signs, \\(m\\) is negative. The sign you get will match what you saw by eye.\n\nSo, by simply observing whether the line rises or falls as you move from left to right on the graph, you can identify a positive or negative slope."

      "student_answer": "The equation is in slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\).\n\n- The constant term \\(b\\) is the **y\u2011intercept**.  \n- Here \\(b = 7\\).\n\nSo the line crosses the y\u2011axis at the point \\((0,\\;7)\\).\n\nOn a graph you would see the line intersect the vertical y\u2011axis exactly at the height\u202f7. That point \\((0,7)\\) is the y\u2011intercept."

      "student_answer": "To predict\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fvalues from a linear equation you just plug the new\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fnumbers into the formula that describes the line.\n\n### 1. Write the equation in slope\u2011intercept form  \n\nThe most convenient form is  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b\n\\]\n\nwhere  \n\n* **\\(m\\)** is the slope (how much\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fchanges for a one\u2011unit change in\u202f\\(x\\)),  \n* **\\(b\\)** is the\u202f\\(y\\)\u2011intercept (the value of\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fwhen\u202f\\(x = 0\\)).\n\nIf you are given the line in another form (point\u2011slope, standard form, etc.), rearrange it until you have\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\).\n\n### 2. Substitute the new\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fvalue  \n\nFor each new \\(x\\) you want a prediction for, replace the \\(x\\) in the equation with that number and do the arithmetic:\n\n\\[\ny_{\\text{predicted}} = m(\\text{new }x) + b\n\\]\n\n### 3. Compute the result  \n\nCarry out the multiplication and addition to obtain the predicted\u202f\\(y\\).\n\n---\n\n#### Example  \n\nSuppose the linear model for a plant\u2019s height is  \n\n\\[\ny = 2x + 3\n\\]\n\n*The slope \\(m = 2\\) tells us the plant grows 2\u202fcm for every extra week, and the intercept \\(b = 3\\)\u202fcm is the height at week\u202f0.*\n\n|\u202f\\(x\\) (weeks)\u202f| Calculation | Predicted \\(y\\) (cm) |\n|---------------|-------------|----------------------|\n| 1 | \\(y = 2(1) + 3\\) | \\(5\\) |\n| 4 | \\(y = 2(4) + 3\\) | \\(11\\) |\n| 7 | \\(y = 2(7) + 3\\) | \\(17\\) |\n| 10 | \\(y = 2(10) + 3\\) | **23** (actually \\(2\u00b710+3 = 23\\), but note I mistakenly wrote 23; the correct value is 23, so the calculation is fine) |\n\n(If you inadvertently plug in a negative slope, you might think the line \u201calways increases as\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fincreases,\u201d which isn\u2019t true when \\(m<0\\); just remember the sign of the slope determines the direction.)\n\n### 4. (Optional) Solve for\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fif you have a desired\u202f\\(y\\)  \n\nIf you need the \\(x\\) that would give a particular \\(y\\), rearrange the same equation:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{y - b}{m}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**In short:** find the slope\u2011intercept equation for the line, substitute each new \\(x\\) value, do the arithmetic, and the result is the predicted \\(y\\). This works for any linear relationship, as long as the model \\(y = mx + b\\) accurately describes the data."

      "student_answer": "The \u201csteepness\u2019\u2019 of a straight\u2011line graph is determined by its **slope**, which comes from the coefficients of the variables in the equation.\n\n* **Slope\u2011intercept form** \u2013 \\(y = mx + b\\)  \n  * The coefficient \\(m\\) is the slope.  \n  * The larger the absolute value \\(|m|\\), the steeper the line.  \n  * If \\(m>0\\) the line rises as you move right (upward\u2011sloping); if \\(m<0\\) it falls (downward\u2011sloping).  \n  * The constant term \\(b\\) is the \\(y\\)-intercept; it shifts the line up or down but does **not** change its steepness.\n\n* **Standard form** \u2013 \\(ax + by = c\\)  \n  * Solving for \\(y\\) gives \\(y = -\\frac{a}{b}x + \\frac{c}{b}\\).  \n  * Here the slope is \\(-\\frac{a}{b}\\).  \n  * The ratio of the coefficients \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) (i.e., \\(-a/b\\)) controls the steepness in the same way: a larger \\(|a/b|\\) makes the line steeper, while the sign tells you whether it slopes upward (\\(-a/b>0\\)) or downward (\\(-a/b<0\\)).  \n  * The constant \\(c\\) only moves the line vertically (through the intercept) and does not affect steepness.\n\nIn short, **the coefficient(s) that form the slope (either \\(m\\) in \\(y=mx+b\\) or the ratio \\(-a/b\\) in \\(ax+by=c\\)) dictate how steep the line is; the other constant term shifts the line without changing its steepness.**"
