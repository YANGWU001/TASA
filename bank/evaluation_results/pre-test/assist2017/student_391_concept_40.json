      "student_answer": "Division is the process of splitting a quantity into a certain number of equal parts. If you have a total amount and you want to know how many pieces you get when it\u2019s divided evenly among a group, you use division. For example, dividing 12 cookies among 4 friends means each friend receives 12\u202f\u00f7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f3 cookies. In other words, division tells you how many times one number contains another, or how big each share is when a whole is shared equally."

      "student_answer": "You can **verify a division result** by working the problem backward.\n\n1. **Multiply** the quotient you got by the divisor.  \n2. **Add** any remainder (if you\u2019re doing whole\u2011number division with a remainder) to that product.  \n3. The number you end up with should be the original dividend.  \n\nIf the numbers line up, your answer is correct.  \n\nA quick sanity check is also useful: compare the size of the quotient to the sizes of the dividend and divisor\u2014if the quotient is larger than the dividend, something went wrong.  \n\n(If you\u2019re ever unsure, you can always do the division again using a different method, like long division or a calculator, to see if you get the same result.)"

      "question": "Write a real-life scenario where division is used, and solve it.",
      "student_answer": "**Real\u2011life scenario**\n\nA city needs to repaint a straight stretch of road that is **120\u202fmiles** long. The work will be divided equally among **5 road\u2011crew teams**, and each team will be assigned the same length of road to repaint.\n\n**Solution (using division)**  \n\nTo find out how many miles each crew will paint, we divide the total length of the road by the number of crews:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Miles per crew} = \\frac{120\\ \\text{miles}}{5\\ \\text{crews}} = 22\\ \\text{miles per crew}\n\\]\n\nSo each crew will be responsible for **about 22\u202fmiles** of road. (The remaining 10\u202fmiles would be handled by the crews as overtime or split among them.)\n\n**Explanation**\n\nDivision lets us split a total amount (the 120\u2011mile road) into equal parts (the 5 crews). By performing the calculation, we know roughly how much work each crew should plan for, which helps with scheduling, ordering the right amount of paint, and estimating the time needed to complete the project."
