      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the new price would be about **$130**.  \n\nI guess you add 15\u202f% of $120, which I\u2019m not really sure how to do\u2026 maybe 15\u202f% of $120 is around $10, so $120\u202f+\u202f$10 \u2248 $130.  (I'm not confident about this.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it might be\u2026 maybe 45? I'm not really sure, but 12% of 300 feels like it could be around forty\u2011something."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what 'percent-of' means and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is kind of like when you take a part of a whole and write it as a fraction out of 100, but I\u2019m not really sure how it works. I guess you just write the percent as a decimal and then \u2026 add it to the number? \n\nFor example, if you have 20\u202f% of 50, I would say you do 20\u202f%\u202f\u00d7\u202f50\u202f=\u202f10, so the answer is 10. But then I remember someone saying you have to add the percent to the original number, so maybe it would be 50\u202f+\u202f10\u202f=\u202f60. I\u2019m really confused, so I\u2019m not sure which one is right. \n\nBasically, \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d seems to mean you somehow combine a percentage with a number, but I keep mixing up whether you multiply or add. Sorry if that doesn\u2019t make sense."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the extra amount is probably pretty small. If they want a 10\u202f% boost on 500 units, maybe it\u2019s only about 5 more units? So I\u2019d say they\u2019d need to produce **around 5 additional units**."
