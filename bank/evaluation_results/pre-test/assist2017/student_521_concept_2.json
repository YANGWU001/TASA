  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of point-plotting concepts. Most answers contain significant inaccuracies, particularly in the definitions and processes related to coordinates and plotting. The student should focus on understanding the roles of x and y coordinates, the correct method for plotting points, and the significance of the origin in the coordinate plane.",

      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think point\u2011plotting is when you start at the origin and then just move\u202fright for any number you have, and you move\u202fup for the y\u2011value.\u202fSo you just count the x\u2011units to the right and the y\u2011units up and put the point there.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure if you have to do anything else, but\u2026 that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you just pick any numbers you like and call them the coordinates. Like, if you have a point somewhere on the graph you could just say it\u2019s (3,\u202f5) even if it\u2019s not really there. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess you just make up the x\u2011 and y\u2011values yourself."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Plot the point (3, -2) on the Cartesian plane.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the point should be plotted where the x\u2011value is\u202f\u20112 and the y\u2011value is\u202f3, so you\u2019d put a dot at (\u20112,\u202f3) on the graph. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe the difference between the x-coordinate and y-coordinate when plotting a point.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the x\u2011coordinate tells you how high or low a point is on the graph, while the y\u2011coordinate tells you how far left or right it is. I'm not completely sure, though."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If a point is located at (-4, 5), in which quadrant of the Cartesian plane does it lie?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s in quadrant\u202fIII, since both coordinates are kind of\u2026 negative?  (I'm not really sure.)"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain the steps to plot the point (0, 6) on a graph. What does the result tell you?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d start at the origin and then move\u202f6\u202funits **to the right** along the horizontal axis, and you don\u2019t move up at all because the first coordinate is 0. So you\u2019d end up at the point\u202f(6,\u202f0)\u202fon the graph.  \n\nThe result would tell you that the point lies on the x\u2011axis, meaning the y\u2011value is zero and the point is purely an x\u2011intercept.  \n\n(I'm not completely sure if that\u2019s right, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Identify the point on the Cartesian plane that is 3 units to the left and 2 units up from the origin.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the point would be \u2026 maybe \\((-2,\\;3)\\).  I'm not completely sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "When plotting points, what is the significance of the origin (0, 0)?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the origin (0,\u202f0) is the point where both coordinates are zero, and that actually makes it the \u201chighest\u201d point on the graph \u2013 like the starting corner where everything is measured from."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the points (2, 5) and (-3, -1), determine the distance between them using the distance formula.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the distance is something like  \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(2+3)^2 + (5+1)^2} \\approx \\sqrt{5^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{25+36} = \\sqrt{61} \\approx 4.2.\n\\]\n\nSo maybe about **4.2 units**."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If you are given a table of x and y values, describe how you would plot those points on a graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d start by drawing a coordinate plane, but I\u2019m not totally sure which axis gets which numbers. I guess you put the x\u2011values on the vertical axis and the y\u2011values on the horizontal axis, then you just mark each pair as a point. After you\u2019ve marked them you can just join the points with a line or something. Maybe you also label each point with its (x,\u202fy) pair, but I\u2019m not really confident about the order of the axes."
