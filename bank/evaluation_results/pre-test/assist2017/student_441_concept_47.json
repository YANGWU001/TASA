      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is kind of weird. If we try to get rid of the \\(2x\\) on both sides we can subtract \\(2x\\) and we end up with  \n\n\\[\n3 = 7 .\n\\]\n\nThat looks false, so I guess maybe there *is* a solution? Like maybe if \\(x = 2\\) then the left side would be \\(2(2)+3 = 7\\) and the right side would be \\(2(2)+7 = 11\\)\u2026 hmm, that doesn\u2019t match.  \n\nOr maybe we should have divided everything by 2 first:  \n\n\\[\nx + 1.5 = x + 3.5,\n\\]\n\nand then cancel the \\(x\\) to get \\(1.5 = 3.5\\), which is also not true.  \n\nSo I\u2019m not really sure, but I think because we end up with a false statement like \\(3 = 7\\) (or \\(1.5 = 3.5\\)) after canceling the \\(x\\) terms, the equation can\u2019t be satisfied by any number. Maybe that means there\u2019s no solution?  (I\u2019m kind of confused.)"
