      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is kind of that when you try to solve it you end up with something like\u202f2x\u202f\u2013\u202f2x\u202f=\u202f7\u202f\u2013\u202f3, which gives\u202f0\u202f=\u202f4. Since that\u2019s not true, the equation can\u2019t be satisfied by any\u202fx. So basically there\u2019s no value of\u202fx\u202fthat makes the two sides equal. \n\n(Or maybe I\u2019m mixing something up\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure.)"
