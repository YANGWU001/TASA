      "question": "Define the relationship between linear measurements and area measurements in conversion processes.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the relationship is kind of straightforward: you just take the linear measurement and use it as the area measurement. So if you have a length of, say, 5\u202fm, the corresponding \u201carea\u201d would just be 5\u202fm\u00b2\u2014basically you treat the linear number as if it were already an area. I\u2019m not really sure about any extra steps like squaring or taking roots; I guess you just keep the same number and change the units."

      "question": "If a square has a side length of 5 meters, calculate its area in square meters.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is probably about **20\u202fm\u00b2**. I'm not completely sure, but that seems close."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain how volume conversion is related to linear and area measurements.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think volume conversion is kind of linked to the other two because you\u2019re basically just scaling the same thing in three dimensions. Like, if you know how to change a length from centimeters to inches, you just **square** that factor to get the area conversion, and then you **cube** it to get the volume conversion.  \n\nSo, for example, if 1\u202fcm\u202f=\u202f0.393\u202fin, then 1\u202fcm\u00b2\u202f\u2248\u202f0.393\u00b2\u202fin\u00b2 and 1\u202fcm\u00b3\u202f\u2248\u202f0.393\u00b3\u202fin\u00b3. In that sense the volume factor is built from the linear factor, and the area factor is kind of the \u201cmiddle step.\u201d  \n\nI guess the idea is you start with a linear measurement, you multiply it by itself to get an area, and then you multiply by the linear again to get a volume. So the conversion factors are just powers of the linear conversion.  \n\n...but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s the whole story. Maybe there\u2019s something else about how the units interact that I\u2019m missing."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If you double the length of all sides of a rectangle, how does its area change?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think if you double the length of all sides of a rectangle, the area just doubles. I'm not totally sure, but that seems right."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Describe the steps required to convert a measurement from square meters to square centimeters.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the conversion is kind of like the length conversion, so you just\u2026 maybe you multiply the number of square meters by 100 to get square centimeters?  \n\nSo the steps would be:  \n\n1. Write down the value in square meters.  \n2. Multiply that number by 100 (since I think 1\u202fm\u00b2 is about 100\u202fcm\u00b2).  \n3. Write the result with the unit \u201ccm\u00b2\u201d.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s how you\u2019d do it."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "When converting area measurements, why is it necessary to square the linear conversion factor?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we have to square the linear conversion factor when we change area units is kind of... because the area unit is actually a volume unit, so we need to \u201cadd\u201d an extra dimension. In other words, you take the linear factor and square it to make sure the conversion works for the extra dimension that area has, even though it\u2019s really a two\u2011dimensional thing. So basically the squaring is there to account for the fact that area isn\u2019t just a length\u2014it\u2019s something like a thin slice of volume. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "Provide an example where linear, area, and volume conversions are all used in a real-world scenario.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011world example might be when you\u2019re buying a new TV.  \n\nFirst, you have to convert the screen\u2019s diagonal length from inches to centimeters \u2013 that\u2019s the linear conversion.  \nThen you might want to change the screen\u2019s area (the picture\u2011area) from square\u202finches to square\u202fmetres so you can compare it to other models \u2013 that\u2019s the area conversion.  \nAnd finally, you could (in a very detailed spec sheet) convert the total volume of the TV\u2019s internal speaker chambers from cubic\u202fcentimetres to cubic\u202finches \u2013 that would be the volume conversion.  \n\nSo you end up using linear, area, and volume conversions all together when you\u2019re comparing TVs."
