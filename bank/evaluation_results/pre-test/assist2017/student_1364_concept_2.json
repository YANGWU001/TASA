      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think point\u2011plotting is kind of like just writing the coordinates on a piece of paper and then drawing a line from the origin to that spot.\u202fYou pick a pair of numbers, like (3,\u202f2), and then you just connect the origin (0,\u202f0) straight to that point with a line, instead of actually locating the point on the grid.\u202fSo basically you just \u201clink\u201d the origin to the coordinate pair \u2013 that\u2019s the whole process, right?  (I\u2019m not totally sure.)"

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you figure out the coordinates by looking at where the point sits relative to the two axes.\u202fThe\u202fx\u2011value is basically how far you go left or right from the\u202fy\u2011axis, and the\u202fy\u2011value is how far you go up or down from the\u202fx\u2011axis.\u202fSo you just count the little squares on the grid: each square is one unit.\u202fIf the point is to the left of the\u202fy\u2011axis you make the\u202fx\u202fnegative, and if it\u2019s below the\u202fx\u2011axis you make the\u202fy\u202fnegative.  \n\nSometimes I\u2019ve heard you can also draw a line from the point straight to the origin and measure the length of that line\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure if that gives you the coordinates or just the distance, but counting the squares is what I usually do."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think you\u2019d put it 3 units to the left of the origin and then 2 units up, so the point would be somewhere in the upper\u2011left quadrant.  (So you\u2019d mark it at (\u20113,\u202f2) instead of (3,\u202f\u20112).)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe the difference between the x-coordinate and y-coordinate when plotting a point.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the x\u2011coordinate is the one that tells you how far up or down a point is on the graph, and the y\u2011coordinate is the one that tells you how far left or right it is.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain the steps to plot the point (0, 6) on a graph. What does the result tell you?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you start by finding the origin (0,\u202f0) on the graph. Then, since the point is written as (0,\u202f6), you\u2019re supposed to move 0 units over on the x\u2011axis *and* 6 units over on the y\u2011axis\u2026 but I always get confused about which way is which. \n\nSo, I would probably do it like this:\n\n1. Start at the origin.  \n2. Because the first number is 0, you don\u2019t go left or right at all \u2013 you stay on the y\u2011axis.  \n3. Then you look at the second number, 6, and move **6 units to the right** along the x\u2011axis. (I think you move right, not up, because it\u2019s the second number.)  \n4. Put a dot there and label it (0,\u202f6).\n\nThe result, I guess, tells you that the point is 6 units away from the origin along the horizontal line\u2026 so maybe it shows the x\u2011intercept of a line that crosses the x\u2011axis at 6? I\u2019m not really sure."

(I could be wrong, though.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the points (2, 5) and (-3, -1), determine the distance between them using the distance formula.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the distance between (2,\u202f5) and (\u20133,\u202f\u20131) is found by using the distance formula  \n\\(d = \\sqrt{(2 - (-3))^2 + (5 - (-1))^2}\\).  \n\nSo that would be \\(\\sqrt{(5)^2 + (6)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + 36} = \\sqrt{61}\\).  \n\nAnd\u2026 I guess \\(\\sqrt{61}\\) is about **7.1** (maybe around 7\u202funits).  \n\nI'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s my best guess."

      "question": "If you are given a table of x and y values, describe how you would plot those points on a graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d start by drawing the axes on a piece of paper. First you make a horizontal line for the **x\u2011axis** and a vertical line for the **y\u2011axis**. Then, I guess you look at each pair of numbers in the table.  \n\nFor each pair, you put the **y\u2011value** on the horizontal line and the **x\u2011value** on the vertical line, because that\u2019s usually how you match them up. So if the table says x = 3 and y =\u202f5, I would count over 5 units on the bottom axis and then go up 3 units on the side, and put a dot there.  \n\nAfter you do that for every row, you just connect the dots if you want a line, or you can leave them as separate points.  \n\nSometimes you might need to label the axes with the variable names, and maybe add a title. That\u2019s about all I can remember. \n\n(Not totally sure if I got the order of the coordinates right, but\u2026 yeah.)"
