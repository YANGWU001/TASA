  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of least common multiples, particularly in explaining its use with fractions and the concept involving prime numbers. However, there are significant errors in calculating specific LCMs and misconceptions about the properties of LCMs, such as the relationship between LCM and larger numbers. More practice with calculations and definitions is needed.",

      "question": "Explain in your own words what the least common multiple (LCM) represents.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the least common multiple is kind of the smallest number that both of the original numbers can **divide into** evenly. Like, it\u2019s the first number that you can put both original numbers into as factors. So if you have 4 and 6, the LCM would be... I guess 12, because that\u2019s the first number that both 4 and 6 can go into? \n\n(I'm not totally sure if I\u2019ve got the wording right.)"

      "question": "Find the least common multiple of 8 and 12 using the prime factorization method.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM is 8.  \n\nI tried to do the prime\u2011factor method:  \n\n- 8 = 2\u00b3  \n- 12 = 2\u00b2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3  \n\nI guess we just take the \u201cbiggest\u201d factor, which is the 2\u00b3 from 8, and ignore the 3 from 12. So 2\u00b3 = 8, and that\u2019s the least common multiple.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "question": "True or False: The least common multiple of two numbers is always greater than or equal to the larger of the two numbers.",

So maybe the common multiples are  \n\n**3,\u202f5,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f10,\u202f12,\u202f15,\u202f18,\u202f20,\u202f21,\u202f24,\u202f25,\u202f27,\u202f30**  \n\n\u2026and the least\u2011common\u2011multiple would be the biggest one, which I guess is\u202f30."

      "question": "How can the least common multiple of two numbers be used in solving problems involving fractions?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the least common multiple is kind of handy when you\u2019re working with fractions because it gives you a common denominator.\u202fSo, if you have two fractions, you find the LCM of their denominators, rewrite each fraction so they both have that LCM as the new denominator, and then you can add, subtract, or compare them more easily.\u202fI guess you could also use the LCM of the numerators if you wanted to make the fractions have the same numerator, but I\u2019m not really sure how that works\u2014maybe it\u2019s not needed?\u202fSorry, I\u2019m a bit fuzzy on the details."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain why the least common multiple of two prime numbers is equal to their product.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is that prime numbers don\u2019t share any factors except\u202f1.  \nSince each prime can only be divided by\u202f1 and itself, there\u2019s no smaller number that\u2019s a multiple of both of them besides their product.  \n\nSo the least common multiple has to include one copy of each prime, and the smallest way to do that is just to multiply them together.  \n\n(If the two primes were the same, the LCM would just be that prime, but for two different primes the LCM is their product.)"
