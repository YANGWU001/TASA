      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Sure, I\u2019ll try to explain how proportions are useful when you want to scale a recipe.\n\n1. **Identify the original ratio** \u2013 First you look at the amount of each ingredient in the original recipe.  For example, if the recipe calls for 2\u202fcups of flour and 1\u202fcup of sugar, the flour\u2011to\u2011sugar ratio is 2\u202f:\u202f1.  (That part is usually straightforward.)\n\n2. **Decide how much you want to change** \u2013 Suppose you want to make half the amount of cookies.  You would then want half of each ingredient.  So you set up a proportion:  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{new amount of flour}}{\\text{original amount of flour}} = \\frac{\\text{new amount of sugar}}{\\text{original amount of sugar}} = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   I think you can also use a scaling factor like 0.5 for \u201chalf\u201d or 2 for \u201cdouble.\u201d  \n\n3. **Use the proportion to find the new quantities** \u2013 Multiply each original amount by the scaling factor.  In this case:  \n\n   * New flour\u202f=\u202f2\u202fcups\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.5\u202f=\u202f1\u202fcup  \n   * New sugar\u202f=\u202f1\u202fcup\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.5\u202f=\u202f0.5\u202fcup (or \u00bd\u202fcup)\n\n   This is the basic idea: the same proportion (the same fraction) is applied to every ingredient.\n\n4. **Check the total \u201cbatch size\u201d** \u2013 Sometimes recipes are given in servings rather than total weight.  If the original recipe makes 12 muffins and you want 24, the scaling factor is 24\u202f\u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f2.  You would then multiply each ingredient by 2.  (I\u2019m a little fuzzy on whether you should also double the baking time, but usually you keep the time the same.)\n\n5. **Watch out for non\u2011linear ingredients** \u2013 Some things like leavening agents (baking powder, yeast) don\u2019t always scale perfectly.  A common mistake is to double the baking powder exactly, which can make the cake taste metallic.  In practice you might use a slightly smaller multiple (maybe 1.5\u202f\u00d7 instead of 2\u202f\u00d7).  I think this part is often overlooked.\n\n6. **Use a cross\u2011multiplication method if you\u2019re more comfortable with it** \u2013 Write the proportion as  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{original amount}}{\\text{desired amount}} = \\frac{\\text{known ingredient}}{\\text{unknown ingredient}}\n   \\]\n\n   Then solve for the unknown by cross\u2011multiplying.  For example, if the original recipe uses 3\u202ftbsp of butter for 6\u202fservings and you need 9\u202fservings, you set  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{x} = \\frac{6}{9}\n   \\]\n\n   Solving gives \\(x = 4.5\\)\u202ftbsp.  (I might have the numerator/denominator reversed here, but the idea is to keep the same ratio.)\n\n7. **Keep the units consistent** \u2013 If the original recipe lists grams and you prefer cups, convert everything first, then apply the proportion.  Mixing units in the proportion will give the wrong answer.\n\n8. **Double\u2011check with a quick sanity test** \u2013 After you finish, look at the numbers.  If you\u2019re suddenly using 10\u202fcups of flour for a small cake, something went wrong with the proportion.\n\nIn short, scaling a recipe is all about keeping the same relative amounts (the same proportion) while changing the overall quantity.  You pick a scaling factor, apply it to each ingredient, and then verify that the resulting amounts make sense.  Occasionally you\u2019ll need to adjust for ingredients that don\u2019t follow a perfect linear relationship, but the proportion framework is the backbone of the process."

      "student_answer": "I think a ratio is just a way of comparing two quantities (like\u202f3\u202fto\u202f4\u202for\u202f3:4), while a proportion is when you set two of those ratios equal to each other (for example\u202f3:4\u202f=\u202f6:8).
