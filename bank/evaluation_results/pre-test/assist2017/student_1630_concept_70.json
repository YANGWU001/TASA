      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation is just a math sentence that tells you one thing is bigger than another, like it uses a \u201c>\u201d sign to compare two numbers.  I\u2019m not completely sure, but I guess that\u2019s what it means."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an expression is the thing that has the equals sign, like\u202f\\(2x+3 = 7\\), and an equation is just a piece without an equals sign, like\u202f\\(2x + 3\\).  So basically the equals sign makes it an expression, and if there\u2019s no equals sign it\u2019s an equation."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Solve the equation: 2x + 5 = 15.",

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If y = 3x + 2, identify the dependent variable in the equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the dependent variable is **x**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole point of balancing both sides of an equation is just to make the two sides look the same, like you want the same number of terms or symbols on each side.  So when you add or subtract something on one side you have to do the same thing on the other side just to keep everything \u201csymmetrical\u201d and \u201cbalanced\u201d in a visual sense.  It\u2019s not really about the actual values being equal, it\u2019s more about keeping the equation looking neat."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011life scenario could be something like the number of pages you read in a day being equal to the number of chapters you finish. So maybe you could write an equation like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Pages read} = \\text{Chapters finished}\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not really sure if that makes perfect sense, but it seems like you could represent it with an equation."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cno solution\u201d means that the equation isn\u2019t really fixed to any one answer \u2013 like it can take any value. So basically there isn\u2019t a single number that makes it true; instead it kind of works for lots of numbers, or it\u2019s just not really solvable at all. I'm not totally sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you\u2019re supposed to take the derivative of the equation and then plug the proposed solution into that derivative. If the derivative comes out to zero at that point, then the original value satisfies the equation.  I'm not totally sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Solve the quadratic equation: x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think I can factor it like this...  \n\n\\(x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 1)(x - 6)\\)  \n\nSo the solutions would be  \n\n\\[\nx = 1 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = 6.\n\\]  \n\nI'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think inverse operations are kind of\u2026 the opposite things you do to both sides of an equation so you can \u201cundo\u201d what\u2019s been done. Like, if you have a multiplication by 5, you use division by 5 on the other side to cancel it out. I guess the idea is that you keep the equation balanced by doing the same opposite step to each side.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe it\u2019s also about switching the equals sign or something? Like, you can add the opposite of a number on one side and subtract it on the other, and that somehow solves the problem. I think the main point is just to make the variable stand alone, so you keep using opposite operations until you get the answer. \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not quite right."
