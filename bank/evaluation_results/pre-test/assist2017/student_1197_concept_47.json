What if we actually should subtract 2 first?  Then it would be  \n\n\\(3x - 6 = 15\\)  \n\nand adding 6 gives \\(3x = 21\\), so \\(x = 7\\) again\u2026  \n\nOr maybe we should have done something else\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the answer is **\\(x = 7\\)**."

      "question": "Explain why the equation 2x + 3 = 2x + 7 has no solution.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason is kind of... maybe because if you try to solve it you end up with something like \\(2x = 2x\\) and then the numbers 3 and 7 just cancel each other out? So you get \\(x = \\frac{7-3}{2}\\) which would be \\(x = 2\\). I guess that means there is actually a solution, \\(x = 2\\), but I'm not totally sure\u2014maybe the equation just simplifies to something true for all \\(x\\)? Sorry, I'm a bit confused."
