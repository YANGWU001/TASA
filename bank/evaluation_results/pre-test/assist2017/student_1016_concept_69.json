    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain why unit conversion is important in scientific experiments.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think unit conversion is kind of important in experiments because you want all the numbers to be in the same units so you can compare them. If you measure something in centimeters and someone else reports it in meters, you could get the wrong answer if you don\u2019t change the units. It also helps when you\u2019re doing calculations\u2014like if you need to use a formula that expects kilograms, you have to change grams to kilograms first, otherwise the result will be off.\n\nI guess it also makes it easier to share data with other scientists, because everyone can understand the numbers if they\u2019re in the same system. And\u2026 maybe it prevents equipment from breaking? Like if you set a machine to work with milliliters but you give it liters, the device might overflow. So converting units helps keep everything consistent and safe. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Describe the process of converting units between different measurement systems, such as metric to imperial.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I guess converting between metric and imperial units is kind of\u2026 a step\u2011by\u2011step thing, but I\u2019m not totally sure I have it right.\n\nFirst, you pick the unit you want to change, like meters to feet. Then you\u2026 look up the conversion factor in a table or something. I think the rule is you **divide** by the factor if you\u2019re going from metric to imperial, and you **multiply** if you go the other way, but maybe it\u2019s the opposite?  \n\nSo, for example, to change 5\u202fm into feet you\u2019d\u2026 maybe divide 5 by 0.3048 (since 1\u202fft \u2248 0.3048\u202fm). That would give you about 16.4\u202fft, I think. Or you could just multiply 5\u202fm by 3.281 (the number of feet in a meter) and get the same answer.  \n\nAfter you get the number, you just write it with the new unit. If you need a mixed unit (like feet and inches), you take the decimal part and multiply it by 12 to get the inches. So 16.4\u202fft would be 16\u202fft and 0.4\u202f\u00d7\u202f12 \u2248\u202f5\u202finches.  \n\nIf you\u2019re converting something like kilograms to pounds, you basically do the same thing: find the factor (about 2.2046\u202flb per\u202fkg) and either multiply or divide depending on which direction you\u2019re going.  \n\nI think the main idea is:\n1. Find the right conversion factor.\n2. Decide whether to multiply or divide (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure which one goes with which system, but it\u2019s something like that).\n3. Do the arithmetic.\n4. If needed, break the result into smaller units (feet/inches, pounds/ounces, etc.).\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much it, I guess."
