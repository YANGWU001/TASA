      "question": "Describe the difference between plotting integers and decimals on a number line.",
      "student_answer": "When you plot points on a number line, the way you locate **integers** is different from the way you locate **decimals** because of how they are spaced and the precision required.\n\n**Integers**\n- Integers are whole numbers (\u2026, \u20133, \u20132, \u20131, 0, 1, 2, 3, \u2026).\n- On a typical number line, the tick marks are placed at equal intervals that represent a distance of **1 unit**.\n- To plot an integer, you simply count the number of ticks to the right of zero for positive integers or to the left of zero for negative integers.  \n  *Example:* To plot \u20132, move two tick marks left from 0; to plot 5, move five tick marks right.\n\n**Decimals**\n- Decimals (e.g., 0.3, 2.75, \u20131.4) fall between the integer tick marks.\n- Because the basic spacing on the line represents 1 unit, you must subdivide the interval between two consecutive integers into smaller, equal parts that correspond to the decimal\u2019s place value.\n  - For tenths (0.1, 0.2, \u2026), split each unit into **10 equal parts**.\n  - For hundredths (0.01, 0.02, \u2026), split each unit into **100 equal parts**, and so on.\n- Locate the decimal by counting these smaller subdivisions.\n  *Example:* To plot 2.75, first move two whole\u2011unit ticks to the right of zero, then go three\u2011quarters of the way through the next unit (three of the four quarter\u2011subdivisions, or 75 of the 100 hundredths).\n\n**Key Differences**\n1. **Spacing of tick marks** \u2013 Integers use the primary unit marks; decimals require additional finer marks.\n2. **Counting steps** \u2013 Integers are counted in whole steps; decimals are counted in fractional steps (tenths, hundredths, etc.).\n3. **Precision** \u2013 Plotting decimals demands a more precise division of each unit interval, while integers are exact whole\u2011number positions.\n\nIn short, integers sit directly on the main tick marks of the number line, whereas decimals occupy positions between those marks, requiring you to break each unit into smaller equal parts to locate them accurately."

      "question": "If you move 5 units to the left from 8 on a number line, where will you end up?",

      "question": "Explain how a number line can be used to visually represent addition and subtraction.",
      "student_answer": "A number line is a straight, evenly\u2011spaced line on which each point corresponds to a real number. By placing numbers on this line we can turn the abstract operations of addition and subtraction into simple \u201cmoves\u201d that are easy to see.\n\n### 1. Adding on a number line  \n1. **Start at the first addend.** Locate the point that represents the number you are adding to (the *augend*).  \n2. **Move to the right.** For every unit you add, shift your finger (or a marker) one tick to the right.  \n3. **Stop after the total number of units.** The point where you stop represents the sum.\n\n*Example:*  \n\\(3 + 4\\) \u2013 Start at 3. Move four ticks right: 4 \u2192\u202f5 \u2192\u202f6 \u2192\u202f7. You land on 7, so \\(3+4=7\\).\n\n### 2. Subtracting on a number line  \n1. **Start at the minuend.** Locate the number you are subtracting from.  \n2. **Move to the left.** For each unit you subtract, shift one tick to the left.  \n3. **Stop when you have moved the required number of units.** The landing point is the difference.\n\n*Example:*  \n\\(6 - 2\\) \u2013 Start at 6. Move two ticks left: 5 \u2192\u202f4. You land on 4, so \\(6-2=4\\).\n\n### 3. Handling negative numbers  \nThe number line extends indefinitely in both directions.  \n\n- **Adding a negative number** is the same as moving left.  \n  *Example:* \\(5 + (-3)\\) \u2192 start at 5, move three ticks left \u2192 land on 2.  \n- **Subtracting a negative number** is the same as adding, so you move right.  \n  *Example:* \\(4 - (-2)\\) \u2192 start at 4, move two ticks right \u2192 land on 6.\n\n### 4. Visual benefits  \n- **Concrete directionality:** \u201cRight\u201d always means increase, \u201cleft\u201d always means decrease.  \n- **Magnitude awareness:** The distance you travel equals the size of the number you are adding or subtracting.  \n- **Error checking:** If you overshoot or undershoot, it\u2019s immediately visible on the line.  \n\nBy turning addition into a rightward walk and subtraction into a leftward walk, the number line gives a clear, visual representation of how numbers combine and separate. This visual approach helps learners develop an intuitive sense of arithmetic operations."
