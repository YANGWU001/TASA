      "question": "Define the relationship between linear measurements and area measurements in conversion processes.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the relationship is kind of\u2026 you just take the linear measurement and\u2026 you don\u2019t really change it, you just treat it as an area? Like if a line is 5\u202fcm long, the \u201carea\u201d would also be 5\u202fcm\u00b2, because you just\u2011\u2011uh\u2026 convert the units directly? \n\nSo, my guess is that the conversion is basically a 1\u2011to\u20111 thing: 1\u202fcm of length becomes 1\u202fcm\u00b2 of area, 2\u202fm becomes 2\u202fm\u00b2, and so on. I\u2019m not really sure how the squaring works, but I think you just keep the same number and change the unit from a linear unit to a square unit. \n\nSorry if that\u2019s off\u2014I'm still confused about how you actually multiply the linear dimension to get area."

      "question": "Explain how volume conversion is related to linear and area measurements.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think volume conversion has something to do with both linear and area measurements, but I\u2019m not really sure how it works.  \n\nMaybe it goes like this: if you have a length in centimeters and you want to change it to meters, you just divide by 100, right? And for area you\u2019d do the same thing\u2014divide by 100 again because you\u2019re dealing with square units. So for volume, you\u2019d just divide by 100 a third time because it\u2019s three\u2011dimensional.  \n\nSo, for example, if I have a cube that is 2\u202fcm on each side, its volume is 2\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fcm\u202f=\u202f8\u202fcm\u00b3. To convert that to cubic meters, I would first convert the side length: 2\u202fcm\u202f=\u202f0.02\u202fm, then multiply those three together: 0.02\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.02\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.02\u202fm\u202f=\u202f0.000008\u202fm\u00b3.  \n\nI guess the idea is that volume conversion \u201cuses\u201d the linear conversion for each dimension, and the area conversion is sort of an intermediate step where you square the linear conversion factor. But I\u2019m not really confident\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing up the steps or the factors.  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not quite right."

      "question": "Describe the steps required to convert a measurement from square meters to square centimeters.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you have to first\u2026 well, you know, change the units. So\u2026  \n\n1. **Figure out the conversion factor.**  \n   I guess 1\u202fmeter is 100\u202fcentimeters, so maybe 1\u202fsquare\u202fmeter is just 100\u202fsquare\u202fcentimeters? (I\u2019m not really sure.)\n\n2. **Multiply the number of square meters by that factor.**  \n   So if you have, say, 3\u202fm\u00b2, you\u2019d do 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202f=\u202f300\u202fcm\u00b2.\n\n3. **Write down the result as square centimeters.**  \n   That should give you the area in cm\u00b2.\n\n4. **Check the answer** by maybe dividing by 10 or something to see if it looks right.\n\nI think that\u2019s basically it, but\u2026 maybe you have to do a different step? I\u2019m not completely confident."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we have to square the linear conversion factor when we\u2019re changing area units is kind of\u2026 mixed up with volume.\u202fWhen you go from, say, square meters to square feet, you\u2019re actually dealing with a three\u2011dimensional thing, so you need to square the factor to make the numbers line up. In other words, you take the linear conversion (like 1\u202fm\u202f=\u202f3.28\u202fft) and you square it because area is \u201cbigger\u201d than length and you have to boost the factor twice.\u202fThat\u2019s why the conversion factor gets squared. \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place where you might need linear, area\u202fand\u202fvolume conversions all at once is when you\u2019re **painting a fence, laying sod, and filling a garden pond**.  \n\nFirst, you\u2019d measure the length of the fence in **yards** and then convert that to **feet** so you know how many panels to buy \u2013 that\u2019s the linear conversion.  \n\nNext, you\u2019d calculate the total surface you have to paint by multiplying the fence length by its height, but I guess you\u2019d accidentally use the **meters\u2011to\u2011inches** conversion instead of the right one, so you\u2019d get a weird number for the area in square inches.  \n\nFinally, for the pond you\u2019d figure out the volume of water it can hold by measuring its length, width, and depth in **feet**, then you\u2019d (incorrectly) convert the volume from cubic feet to **gallons** by multiplying by\u202f100\u202finstead of the correct factor (about\u202f7.48).  \n\nSo basically you\u2019d be juggling all three types of conversions in that same backyard project\u2014although I\u2019m not totally sure my unit factors are right."
