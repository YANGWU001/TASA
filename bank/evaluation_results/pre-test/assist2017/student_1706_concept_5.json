Key mistakes include confusing perimeter with area and incorrect area calculations for rectangles and circles. More practice with area formulas and their applications is needed.",

      "question": "What is the formula to calculate the area of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a rectangle is\u2026 maybe the sum of the sides? Like length\u202f+\u202fwidth? I'm not really sure, but I think you just add the two sides together."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is 8 cm and the width is 5 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is about 13\u202fcm\u00b2."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the difference is kind of\u2026 uh\u2026 the area is the amount of space you have *inside* a shape, like the surface you could cover with paint, while the perimeter is\u2026 actually, maybe it\u2019s the total amount of space inside too?\u202fI\u2019m not sure, but I think the perimeter is the *total length* of all the sides of the shape, kind of like the \u201cborder\u201d you\u2019d walk around, and the area is the \u201cinside\u201d part. So\u2026 yeah, area is the inside space, and perimeter is the boundary length around it."

      "question": "A triangle has a base of 10 cm and a height of 6 cm. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the area is just base times height, so maybe it\u2019s  \n\n**Area \u2248 10\u202fcm \u00d7 6\u202fcm = 60\u202fcm\u00b2**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a circle is something like \u2026 maybe\u202f2\u202f\u03c0\u202fr?  I\u2019m not totally sure, but I remember the circumference is 2\u03c0r, and I think the area is just the same formula without squaring the radius. So I\u2019d calculate it by multiplying 2\u202f\u03c0 by the radius."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A square has a side length of 4 meters. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is about 12\u202fm\u00b2, but I'm not really sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we write area in square units is because area is actually a kind of volume thing.\u202fWhen you measure a shape you\u2019re really measuring how much \u201cstuff\u201d fits inside it, so you end up squaring the length unit to get something that looks like a volume.\u202fThat\u2019s why we write, for example,\u202fm\u00b2\u202finstead of just\u202fm\u202f\u2013 it\u2019s kind of a shortcut for the three\u2011dimensional \u201cspace\u201d the shape takes up.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If a parallelogram has a base of 12 cm and a height of 7 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area is\u2026 maybe about 42\u202fcm\u00b2? I'm not totally sure, but if I take half of the base times the height I get something like that."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place where you\u2019d need to calculate area is when you\u2019re measuring the length of a road.\u202fYou have to figure out the \u201carea\u201d of the road so you know how many miles of asphalt to order.\u202fThe bigger the area, the longer the road, so the calculation helps with budgeting the material.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s why area would matter there."

      "question": "A rectangular garden has dimensions of 15 meters by 10 meters. If you want to cover it with grass, how many square meters of grass will you need?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the area is probably **25 square meters**. I'm not totally sure, but that seems about right."
