Most answers are correct and well-explained, showing a clear grasp of concepts like slope, y-intercept, and the relationship between coefficients and steepness. However, there was a minor error in Question 6 regarding the calculation of the y-value, indicating a need for careful arithmetic when substituting values into equations.",

In other words, it gives the rate of change between the two variables.

      "student_answer": "I think two linear equations are parallel when their graphs have the same slope, so the lines never intersect.\u202fUsually this also means they have a different\u202fy\u2011intercept (otherwise they would be the exact same line), but I\u2019m not completely sure\u2014some textbooks just say \u201csame slope\u201d and don\u2019t mention the intercept at all."

      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "When you look at the picture of a straight line you can tell the sign of its slope just by watching how the line moves as you go from the left side of the graph to the right side.\n\n* **Positive slope** \u2013 the line goes **upward** as you move to the right.  In other words, if you pick two points on the line, the point that is farther to the right will also be higher on the y\u2011axis.  The line looks like \u201c/\u201d (but not vertical).  The steeper the line, the larger the positive number for the slope.\n\n* **Negative slope** \u2013 the line goes **downward** as you move to the right.  The point that is farther to the right will be lower on the y\u2011axis.  The line looks like \u201c\\\u201d (again, not vertical).  A steeper downward line has a larger\u2011in\u2011absolute\u2011value (more negative) slope.\n\n* **Zero slope** \u2013 if the line is completely horizontal (looks like \u201c\u2014\u201d), the slope is 0 because the y\u2011value doesn\u2019t change at all as you move left\u2011to\u2011right.\n\n* **Vertical line** \u2013 some people think a vertical line has a positive slope because it goes \u201cup\u201d from bottom to top, but actually a vertical line does **not** have a defined (finite) slope; it would be \u201cinfinite\u201d or undefined.\n\nSo, in short, check the direction of the line from left to right: upward\u202f=\u202fpositive, downward\u202f=\u202fnegative, flat\u202f=\u202fzero, and perfectly vertical\u202f=\u202fno finite slope."

      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "The y\u2011intercept is the constant term in the equation, so it\u2019s **7**.  \nOn the graph this shows up as the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis, which is the point **(0\u202f,\u202f7)**.  In other words, when x\u202f=\u202f0, y\u202f=\u202f7, so the line meets the vertical axis at that height."

      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "To use a linear equation to predict\u202fy\u202fyou first write the equation in a form that isolates\u202fy\u202f\u2014 most often the slope\u2011intercept form  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b\n\\]\n\nwhere  \n\n* **m** is the slope (the change in\u202fy\u202ffor each one\u2011unit change in\u202fx)  \n* **b** is the y\u2011intercept (the value of\u202fy\u202fwhen\u202fx = 0).\n\nOnce you have the equation, you simply **plug the new x\u2011value into it** and do the arithmetic:\n\n\\[\ny_{\\text{pred}} = m \\times x_{\\text{new}} + b .\n\\]\n\nFor example, if the equation you derived from data is  \n\n\\[\ny = 2x + 3,\n\\]\n\nand you want to know\u202fy\u202fwhen\u202fx = 5, you calculate  \n\n\\[\ny = 2 \\times 5 + 3 = 13.\n\\]\n\nIf the linear relationship is given in another form, such as the standard form  \n\n\\[\nAx + By = C,\n\\]\n\nyou can first solve for\u202fy\u202fby moving the\u202fAx\u202fterm to the other side and dividing by\u202fB:\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{C - Ax}{B},\n\\]\n\nand then substitute the new\u202fx\u202fvalue.\n\nA common shortcut people sometimes use (and I\u2019m not completely sure it always works) is to **divide the x\u2011value by the slope and then add the intercept**. I think that would look like  \n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{x_{\\text{new}}}{m} + b,\n\\]\n\nbut that is actually a mistake \u2013 the correct operation is to multiply by the slope, not divide.  \n\nSo, in short: write the line as\u202fy = mx + b, substitute the new\u202fx, and compute\u202fy. Just remember to stay within the range of the original data (extrapolating far beyond it can give unreliable predictions)."

      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "The slope (or \u201csteepness\u201d) of a line is determined by the coefficient that multiplies the variable\u202f\\(x\\) in the linear equation \\(y = mx + b\\).  In general, the larger the absolute value of the coefficient\u202f\\(m\\), the steeper the line\u2014if\u202f\\(m\\) is positive the line rises as you move to the right, and if\u202f\\(m\\) is negative the line falls.  I think the constant term\u202f\\(b\\) also plays a role in how steep the graph looks, because it shifts the line up or down and can change the angle a little.  So, in short, the coefficient in front of\u202f\\(x\\) mainly controls steepness, while the other coefficient (the intercept) can also affect it to some degree."
