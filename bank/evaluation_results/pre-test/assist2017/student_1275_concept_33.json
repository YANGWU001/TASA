      "student_answer": "Multiplication is a way of adding the same number together many times.  \nFor example, instead of saying\u202f2\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f2, we can write\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f4, which means \u201cfour groups of two.\u201d The result we get is called the product. So multiplication tells us how big a total is when we have equal\u2011sized groups or repeated addition."

      "student_answer": "Yes, \\(0 \\times 5 = 0\\).\n\n**Why:**  \nMultiplication means adding a number to itself a certain number of times.  \nWhen we multiply by 0, we are adding the other number zero times \u2013 that is, we add nothing at all. So the total is 0. In other words, any number multiplied by 0 always gives 0."

      "student_answer": "The equation uses the **associative property of multiplication**, which states that when three numbers are multiplied, the way in which they are grouped does not affect the product:  \n\n\\[\n3 \\times (4 \\times 5) = (3 \\times 4) \\times 5.\n\\]"
