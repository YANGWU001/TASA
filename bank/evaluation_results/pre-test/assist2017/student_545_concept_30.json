  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a significant misunderstanding of supplementary angles. None of the answers provided are correct, indicating a lack of understanding of the basic definition and properties of supplementary angles. The student should review the definitions and relationships between angles, particularly focusing on the sum of supplementary angles being 180 degrees.",

      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two 90\u00b0 angles aren\u2019t really supplementary.\u202fThey\u2019re both right angles, and I guess supplementary angles are supposed to be one acute and one obtuse that add up to 180\u00b0, so 90\u00b0\u202f+\u202f90\u00b0 doesn\u2019t count.  (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of... well, supplementary angles are the ones that add up to a right angle, so their measures total\u202f90\u202fdegrees.\u202fAnd complementary angles are the ones that add up to a straight angle, so they sum to\u202f180\u202fdegrees.\u202f\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really confident, but I think the other angle would be\u202f**180\u202f+\u202fx\u202fdegrees**."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think two obtuse angles *can* be supplementary. Like, if one angle is about 100\u00b0 and the other is\u2026 maybe 80\u00b0? That would add up to 180\u00b0, which is what \u201csupplementary\u201d means, right? So I guess it\u2019s possible for two obtuse angles to be supplementary."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the angles might be 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0.\u202fOne of them is twice the other, right? So maybe 45\u00b0\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 = 90\u00b0, but then I\u2019m not sure\u2026 maybe it\u2019s 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0.  I\u2019m kinda guessing here."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two angles aren\u2019t supplementary.  I guess supplementary angles have to add up to\u202f360\u00b0, so 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0\u202f=\u202f180\u00b0 doesn\u2019t match that, which means they\u2019re not a supplementary pair.  (I\u2019m not really sure, sorry.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is kind of fuzzy to me.  I guess when you put two angles together they somehow \u201cline up\u201d and make a straight line.  Maybe it\u2019s because their measures add up to a whole turn\u2026 like\u202f360\u00b0, so they sort of fill up the whole space and end up looking like one straight angle.  I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you add the two angles together.\u202fSo 45\u00b0\u202f+\u202f135\u00b0 would be\u2026 I guess 190\u00b0. Since that\u2019s not 180\u00b0, they wouldn\u2019t be supplementary. (I\u2019m not really sure, though.)"
