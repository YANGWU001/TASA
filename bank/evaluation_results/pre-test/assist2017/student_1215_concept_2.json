  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of point-plotting concepts, including how to read and plot points on a coordinate plane, the significance of coordinates, and the origin. However, the calculation of the distance in Question 9 contains an error in the distance formula application, which detracts from the overall accuracy. Overall, the student shows good comprehension and attention to detail.",

      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "The process of point\u2011plotting on a coordinate plane is pretty straightforward:\n\n1. **Read the ordered pair (\u202fx ,\u202fy\u202f).**  \n   The first number, *x*, tells you how far to move along the horizontal (x\u2011) axis, and the second number, *y*, tells you how far to move along the vertical (y\u2011) axis.\n\n2. **Locate the x\u2011value on the horizontal axis.**  \n   Start at the origin (0,0) and move left or right until you reach the given *x* coordinate.\n\n3. **From that spot, move up or down to the y\u2011value.**  \n   Once you\u2019re at the correct *x* position, go straight up (for a positive *y*) or straight down (for a negative *y*) until you hit the appropriate *y* coordinate.\n\n4. **Mark the point.**  \n   Put a small dot or cross where the two movements intersect.  \n\n5. **Label (optional).**  \n   You can write the ordered pair next to the dot to show which point you just plotted.\n\nIn short, you translate the ordered pair (x,\u202fy) into a location by moving horizontally for the x\u2011coordinate and then vertically for the y\u2011coordinate, and finally you place a point at the intersection of those moves."

      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "To find the coordinates of a point on a graph you simply read its horizontal (\u202fx\u202f)\u2011value and its vertical (\u202fy\u202f)\u2011value from the axes.\n\n1. **Locate the point** on the grid.  \n2. **Move straight down (or up) to the\u202fx\u2011axis** \u2013 the number you hit is the x\u2011coordinate.  \n3. **Move straight across (left or right) to the\u202fy\u2011axis** \u2013 the number you hit is the y\u2011coordinate.  \n\nThe ordered pair is written as \\((x,\\;y)\\).  \nFor example, if the point lines up with 3 on the x\u2011axis and \u20112 on the y\u2011axis, its coordinates are \\((3,\\,-2)\\)."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Plot the point (3, -2) on the Cartesian plane.",
      "student_answer": "The point \\((3,\\,-2)\\) is located **three units to the right of the origin** (positive\u202fx\u2011direction) and **two units down** (negative\u202fy\u2011direction). On a standard Cartesian grid you would move right three squares from the origin, then down two squares and place the point at that intersection."

      "question": "Describe the difference between the x-coordinate and y-coordinate when plotting a point.",
      "student_answer": "The **x\u2011coordinate** tells you how far a point lies to the right (positive) or to the left (negative) of the origin\u202f(0,0) along the horizontal axis.  \nThe **y\u2011coordinate** tells you how far a point lies above (positive) or below (negative) the origin along the vertical axis.  \n\nSo, when you plot a point \\((x, y)\\), the first number (x) fixes its horizontal position, and the second number (y) fixes its vertical position. Together they pinpoint the exact location of the point on the plane."

      "student_answer": "The point \\((-4,\\;5)\\) has a negative\u202f\\(x\\)-coordinate and a positive\u202f\\(y\\)-coordinate, so it lies in the **second quadrant** of the Cartesian plane."

Here\u202f*x\u202f=\u202f0*, so you stay directly on the\u202f*y*\u2011axis; no horizontal movement is needed.  \n\n4. **Locate the y\u2011coordinate** \u2013 From the origin, move **up** (because the y\u2011value is positive) 6 units along the\u202f*y*\u2011axis.  \n\n5. **Place the point** \u2013 Put a dot at the spot you\u2019ve reached and label it\u202f(0,\u202f6) if you wish.  \n\n**What the result tells you**  \n\n- The point lies **exactly on the\u202f*y*\u2011axis**, because its\u202f*x*\u2011coordinate is zero.  \n- Its distance from the origin is\u202f6 units in the positive\u202f*y* direction, so it is 6 units **above** the origin.  \n- In the context of any problem, this means the variable represented by\u202f*x* has no contribution at that location, while the variable represented by\u202f*y* has the value\u202f6."

      "student_answer": "The origin\u202f(0,\u202f0) is the reference point where the x\u2011axis and y\u2011axis intersect. It serves as the \u201czero point\u201d for both coordinates, so any other point\u2019s position is measured as a distance to the right/left (positive/negative x\u2011values) and up/down (positive/negative y\u2011values) from the origin. In other words, the origin is the baseline from which all other coordinates are defined on the graph."
