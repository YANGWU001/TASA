      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation is just a kind of math problem that tells you the slope of a line or something like that. It\u2019s not really a statement of equality, it\u2019s more like a rule for how a line changes. (I\u2019m not really sure.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation and an expression are kind of the same thing, except\u2026 maybe an equation just has a little extra stuff in it? Like, I guess an expression is just a bunch of numbers and variables, and an equation is also a bunch of numbers and variables but you also write an equals sign\u2011\u2011or maybe that\u2019s the other way around? Honestly I\u2019m not really sure\u2026\u200b"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I\u2019m not totally sure, but if I solve\u202f2x\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f15, I\u2019d subtract 5 from both sides first, so\u202f2x\u202f=\u202f10. Then I\u2019d divide by\u202f2, which gives\u202fx\u202f\u2248\u202f5\u2026 Wait, actually\u2026 maybe I made a mistake and it should be\u202fx\u202f=\u202f10?  I\u2019m not confident, but I think the answer is\u202f10."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole point of balancing both sides of an equation is just to make the expression look nice and \u201ceven,\u201d like keeping a scale balanced.\u202fYou just want the numbers on each side to match up so the equation looks symmetric, but it doesn\u2019t really change anything about solving it."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a real\u2011life situation you could write as an equation might be something like the total cost of a pizza.  You could say  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost} = (\\text{number of slices}) \\times (\\text{diameter of the pizza}).\n\\]\n\nSo if you have a pizza that\u2019s 12\u202finches across and you cut it into 8 slices, the cost would be 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f96 (dollars, maybe?).  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the best example, but it seems like you could use an equation to relate the pieces."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it means that the equation is actually true for every possible value of the variable, so there isn\u2019t any single specific solution you can point to. In other words, the equation doesn\u2019t have one \u201canswer\u201d because it works for all numbers."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you\u2019re supposed to... maybe plug the answer into the equation and then... actually, I\u2019m not totally sure. My guess is that you take the proposed solution, substitute it back into the original equation, and then see if the two sides end up being equal. If they match, then it works; if they don\u2019t, then it doesn\u2019t.  \n\nBut, uh, I\u2019ve also heard that sometimes you can just look at the graph and see if the point lies on the curve, so maybe that\u2019s another way?  I'm not really confident which one is the right method."

      "student_answer": "The quadratic can be factored:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0.\n\\]\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives the solutions:\n\n\\[\nx - 2 = 0 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; x = 2,\n\\qquad\nx - 3 = 0 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; x = 3.\n\\]\n\nSo the equation \\(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\\) has the two solutions  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x = 2 \\text{ or } x = 3}.\n\\]"

      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think inverse operations are mainly used **after** you\u2019ve already solved an equation, just to check that your answer works. Like, you\u2019d take the result and then do the opposite operation to see if you get back to the original expression. So instead of using them to actually isolate the variable, you use them at the end to verify the solution. I guess that\u2019s the role they play\u2026?"
