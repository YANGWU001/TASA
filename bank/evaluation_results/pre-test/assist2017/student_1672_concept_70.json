      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think an equation is kind of like a formula that shows how two things are related\u2014like you write something down that tells you what one quantity is in terms of another. I'm not totally sure, but I guess it\u2019s a statement that connects variables together."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think an **expression** is the thing that actually has the \u201c=\u202f\u201d sign in it, like a formula, and a **equation** is just a part of that expression without the equals sign. So, basically the equation is the piece, and the expression is the whole thing with the \u201c=\u201d in it."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If y = 3x + 2, identify the dependent variable in the equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the dependent variable is probably **x**. I'm not totally sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the point of balancing both sides of an equation is mostly just to make the two sides look the same, like you want the same number of terms or the same shape on each side.\u202fIt\u2019s kind of a way to keep the equation \u201cnice\u201d so that if you do the same operation on both sides you don\u2019t mess it up.\u202fI don\u2019t think it has anything to do with actually solving for an unknown\u2014just keeping the sides equal\u2011looking."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a real\u2011life situation could be something like buying apples. Like, if I have 5 apples and each apple costs $2, then the total cost would be \u2026 maybe 5\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f7 dollars? So the equation would be\u202f5\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f7 to represent the cost. I'm not totally sure, but that seems like a way to model it."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cno solution\u201d means that the equation isn\u2019t really solvable because there are\u2026 well, actually I think it means there are infinitely many possibilities for the variable, so any number would work and you can\u2019t pick a single answer.\u202f(Not sure if that\u2019s right.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell if a solution works for an equation by\u2026 kind of looking at the shape of the graph. Like you plot the equation, put the proposed solution in as a point, and if the point sits on the curve you\u2019re done. If it\u2019s off the curve, then it doesn\u2019t satisfy it. I\u2019m not really sure if you have to do any plugging\u2011in or anything else, but I guess checking the graph is the way to go."

      "question": "Solve the quadratic equation: x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the solutions are probably negative\u2026 maybe \\(x = -2\\) and \\(x = -3\\).  I'm not really sure, but that seems to make the equation zero."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea of inverse operations is kind of\u2026 you know, you use them to\u2026 \u201cundo\u201d whatever you did to the variable. So, for example, if you added something to the variable, you would\u2026 uh\u2026 subtract the same thing on the other side to keep the equation balanced. And if you multiplied the variable by a number, you would\u2026 divide by that number. \n\nI guess the point is that you keep doing those opposite steps until the variable is all by itself, and then you\u2019ve solved the equation. I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the inverses also help you check your work because you can reverse the steps and get back to the original equation. \n\nSo\u2026 basically, you just keep applying opposite operations until the variable is isolated."
