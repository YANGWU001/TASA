  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of multiplying decimals, but several answers show uncertainty or incorrect calculations. They correctly explained the process of multiplying decimals and identified the movement of the decimal point in some cases, but made errors in specific calculations. Encouragement to practice more and verify answers would be beneficial.",

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the process of multiplying two decimals, for example, 1.2 x 0.4.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the way you multiply decimals is kind of like regular multiplication, but you have to keep track of the decimal points at the end. So, for example, with 1.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.4, I would first ignore the decimals and just multiply 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f4, which gives me 48. Then, I count how many decimal places there are in the original numbers: 1.2 has one decimal place and 0.4 also has one, so together that\u2019s two decimal places. So I would put the decimal point two places from the right in 48, which would make it 0.48. \n\nSo my final answer is **0.48**. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if I\u2019m supposed to do anything else, like maybe multiply 1.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 first and then adjust, but I think this is the basic process."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What happens to the decimal point when multiplying 4.5 by 0.01?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you multiply 4.5 by 0.01 you move the decimal point two places to the left. So\u202f4.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.01\u202f\u2248\u202f0.045.  (The decimal shifts left because you\u2019re multiplying by a hundredth.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Calculate 0.09 x 0.6 and explain each step.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think I can try to do this\u2026\n\nFirst I\u2019m going to ignore the decimals for a second and just multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers:  \n\\(9 \\times 6 = 54\\).\n\nSince the original problem has one decimal place in the second factor (the \u201c0.6\u201d), I think I only need to move the decimal one place to the left in the product. So I\u2019d put the decimal in front of the 54 and get:\n\n\\[\n0.54\n\\]\n\nSo, I guess \\(0.09 \\times 0.6 = 0.54\\).\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got."

      "question": "If you multiply 1.8 by 0.4, how many decimal places will be in the product? Why?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the product will have **one** decimal place.  \n\nSince 1.8 has one decimal digit and 0.4 also has one, I guess you just keep the same number of decimal places as the original numbers, so the answer would be something like 0.7\u202f\u2026 (actually I\u2019m not really sure, but I think it\u2019s one decimal place)."
