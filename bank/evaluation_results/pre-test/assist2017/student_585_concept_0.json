      "question": "What are the defining properties of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "A rectangle is a specific type of quadrilateral that satisfies the following defining properties:\n\n1. **Four sides** \u2013 it is a four\u2011sided polygon.  \n2. **Opposite sides are parallel** \u2013 each pair of opposite sides lies on parallel lines.  \n3. **Opposite sides are equal in length** \u2013 the top and bottom sides have the same length, and the left and right sides have the same length.  \n4. **All interior angles are right angles** \u2013 each of the four angles measures \\(90^\\circ\\).  \n5. **Diagonals are congruent** \u2013 the two diagonals have the same length (though they are not necessarily perpendicular).  \n\nThese properties together distinguish a rectangle from other quadrilaterals. (A square is a special case of a rectangle in which all four sides are also equal.)"

      "question": "Explain how the properties of a rhombus differ from those of a square.",
      "student_answer": "Both a rhombus and a square are special types of parallelograms, so they share a few basic properties:  \n\n* **Four sides** \u2013 each figure has four straight sides.  \n* **Opposite sides are parallel** \u2013 the opposite sides never meet.  \n* **All sides are equal in length** \u2013 each side of a rhombus and each side of a square has the same length as the others.\n\nThe main ways they differ are in their angles and diagonal behavior:\n\n| Property | Rhombus | Square |\n|----------|---------|--------|\n| **Angles** | The interior angles can be any pair of acute and obtuse angles that add up to 360\u00b0. A rhombus does **not** require right angles. | All four interior angles are right angles (90\u00b0). |\n| **Diagonals** | The two diagonals intersect at right angles (they are perpendicular), but they are generally **not** equal in length. | The diagonals are also perpendicular **and** they are **congruent** (the same length). |\n| **Angle symmetry** | A rhombus does **not** have all angles equal; only opposite angles are equal. | A square has all four angles equal (each 90\u00b0). |\n\nSo, while both shapes have equal sides and are parallelograms, a square is a more restrictive case: it forces right angles and equal diagonals, whereas a rhombus allows the angles to be any acute/obtuse pair and its diagonals are only required to be perpendicular, not equal."

      "question": "How can you determine if a quadrilateral is a parallelogram based on its properties?",
      "student_answer": "To decide whether a four\u2011sided figure is a parallelogram you can check a few key properties.  \nIf **any one** of the following conditions holds, the quadrilateral must be a parallelogram:\n\n1. **Both pairs of opposite sides are parallel.**  \n   (If you can draw a line through one side that never meets the opposite side, and the same is true for the other pair, the shape is a parallelogram.)\n\n2. **Both pairs of opposite sides are equal in length.**  \n   (When the top and bottom sides have the same length **and** the left and right sides have the same length, the figure is a parallelogram.)\n\n3. **Both pairs of opposite angles are equal.**  \n   (If the angle at the upper\u2011left corner equals the angle at the lower\u2011right corner, and the other two angles are also equal, you have a parallelogram.)\n\n4. **The diagonals bisect each other.**  \n   (If the point where the two diagonals cross cuts each diagonal into two equal parts, the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.)\n\nIn practice you only need to verify one of these criteria; if it\u2019s true, the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. If none of them are satisfied, the shape is not a parallelogram."

      "question": "Identify the properties that distinguish a trapezoid from other quadrilaterals.",
      "student_answer": "A trapezoid (sometimes called a trapezium in other countries) is a four\u2011sided figure that can be recognized by the following distinguishing features:\n\n1. **At least one pair of parallel sides** \u2013 the two sides that are parallel are called the **bases** of the trapezoid.  \n2. The other two sides, which are not parallel, are called the **legs**.  \n3. The **bases** can be of different lengths; the legs may be equal or unequal. When the legs are equal the trapezoid is called an **isosceles trapezoid**.  \n4. The interior angles adjacent to each base are **supplementary** (they add up to 180\u00b0).  \n5. The **sum of all four interior angles** of any quadrilateral, including a trapezoid, is 360\u00b0.  \n6. A trapezoid **does not have to have right angles**; however, a right\u2011angled trapezoid is a special case where one leg is perpendicular to the bases.  \n7. An isosceles trapezoid **has a single line of symmetry** that runs vertically through the mid\u2011point of the bases (but a general trapezoid need not be symmetric).  \n\nThese properties set the trapezoid apart from other quadrilaterals such as rectangles, squares, rhombuses and general parallelograms, which have two pairs of parallel sides."

      "question": "If one angle of a triangle is 90 degrees, what type of triangle is it and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "A triangle that has one 90\u2011degree angle is called a **right triangle** (or right\u2011angled triangle).\n\n**Key properties of a right triangle**\n\n| Property | Explanation |\n|----------|--------------|\n| **One right angle** | Exactly one of the interior angles measures 90\u00b0. |\n| **Sum of angles** | The three interior angles always add to 180\u00b0, so the other two angles are acute and together total 90\u00b0 (they are complementary). |\n| **Sides** | The side opposite the right angle is the **hypotenuse**; it is the longest side of the triangle. The other two sides are called the **legs**. |\n| **Pythagorean theorem** | The lengths of the sides satisfy \\(a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the legs and \\(c\\) is the hypotenuse. |\n| **Area** | The area can be found easily as \\(\\displaystyle \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2}\\times(\\text{leg}_1)\\times(\\text{leg}_2)\\). |\n| **Special cases** |\n| \u2013 **Isosceles right triangle** | If the two legs are equal, each of the acute angles measures 45\u00b0, and the triangle is both right\u2011angled and isosceles. |\n| \u2013 **Scalene right triangle** | If the legs have different lengths, the two acute angles are different (still adding to 90\u00b0). |\n\nThese properties are useful for identifying right triangles, solving for missing side lengths or angles, and computing area or perimeter."

      "question": "How do the properties of regular polygons differ from irregular polygons?",
      "student_answer": "**Regular polygons**\n\n* All sides have the same length.  \n* All interior angles are equal.  \n* Because the sides and angles are identical, a regular polygon can be rotated or reflected about its centre and it will look exactly the same (it has *rotational* and *reflectional* symmetry).  \n* In the usual (simple) case the polygon is convex \u2013 every interior angle is less than\u202f180\u00b0 and any line drawn between two vertices stays inside the shape.  \n\n**Irregular polygons**\n\n* The side lengths are not all equal, and the interior angles are not all equal (though some of them may coincidentally match).  \n* They generally have less symmetry; most irregular polygons have no rotational symmetry and only limited or no reflection symmetry.  \n* They can be convex or concave, depending on whether any interior angle exceeds 180\u00b0 (concave) or not (convex).  \n\n**Key differences**\n\n| Feature | Regular polygon | Irregular polygon |\n|---------|----------------|-------------------|\n| Side lengths | All equal | Vary |\n| Interior angles | All equal | Vary |\n| Symmetry | High (rotational & reflectional) | Low or none |\n| Typical shape | Convex (in the usual simple case) | May be convex or concave |\n\nSo, regular polygons are the \u201cperfectly balanced\u201d cases with equal sides and angles and a high degree of symmetry, while irregular polygons lack those uniformities and can have a mix of side lengths, angles, and symmetry properties."
