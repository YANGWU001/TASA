      "question": "What is the definition of a discount in financial terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount is kind of like the extra amount you pay when you borrow money \u2013 like an extra fee on top of the price. So in finance a discount would be the additional charge you add to the face value of a loan or a security. (I'm not really sure.)"

      "question": "If an item originally costs $50 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the discounted price?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the discount would be $5\u2026 so maybe the sale price is around **$45**."

      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think businesses give discounts for a few reasons.  \n\nFirst, they hope a lower price will bring more customers in, so even if each sale brings in less money, the total number of sales goes up and they can still make a decent profit.  \n\nSecond, they can use discounts to clear out old or slow\u2011moving inventory \u2013 like when a store has extra stock that\u2019s about to expire, they\u2019ll cut the price to get rid of it.  \n\nThird, discounts are sometimes used to attract new shoppers or to keep regular ones from going to a competitor, so it\u2019s a way to stay competitive.  \n\nI\u2019ve also heard that discounts can be a reward for loyal customers, kind of like a \u201cthank\u2011you\u201d for coming back, and that can make people feel valued and shop more often.  \n\n\u2026maybe one more thing: some businesses think that giving a discount actually raises the overall price of the product because it makes it seem more valuable, but I\u2019m not really sure about that part.  \n\nSo, overall, discounts are mainly about getting more sales, moving stock, staying competitive, and rewarding customers, even if the math isn\u2019t always perfect."

      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there are a couple of discount kinds that people usually see.  \n\nOne is a **seasonal discount**, which is like when a store says \u201c30\u202f% off all winter coats in the summer.\u201d\u202fThe idea is to move old\u2011season inventory, so you just get a percentage taken off the regular price.  \n\nThe other one is a **buy\u2011one\u2011get\u2011one\u2011free discount**.\u202fFor example, a bakery might say \u201cBuy one loaf of bread and get the second loaf free,\u201d which is basically a 100\u202f% discount on the second item.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but those are two common types of discounts that I\u2019ve seen."

      "question": "A store is offering a buy-one-get-one-50%-off deal. If the first item costs $40 and the second item costs $30, what is the total cost after applying the discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the discount would reduce both items by half. So the $40 item would be $20 and the $30 item would be $15. Adding those together gives a total of **$35**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount usually makes the product seem *less* valuable, because the lower price can give the impression that the item isn\u2019t as good or is lower\u2011quality. So when a store puts a big\u2011percent off sign up, most people might think, \u201cIf it\u2019s that cheap, maybe it\u2019s not worth as much.\u201d  \n\nI guess that\u2019s why some brands avoid big discounts \u2013 they don\u2019t want customers to think the product has lost its prestige.  \n\n(\u2026maybe I\u2019m mixing things up, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "Calculate the final cost of a $120 item after a 15% discount and a $10 coupon.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the discount would be $120\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.15\u202f\u2248\u202f$18, so the price after the discount is about $120\u202f\u2212\u202f$18\u202f=\u202f$102. Then, with the $10 coupon, I guess you\u2019d subtract another $10, which gives\u2026 maybe $92? \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014maybe I should have subtracted the coupon first? If I did $120\u202f\u2212\u202f$10\u202f=\u202f$110 and then took 15% off that, it would be $110\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.15\u202f\u2248\u202f$16.5, so the final price would be $110\u202f\u2212\u202f$16.5\u202f\u2248\u202f$93.5. \n\nSo, I\u2019m kinda confused\u2014maybe the final cost is around $92\u2011$94. Sorry!"

      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a company might use seasonal discounts mostly because\u2026 um, they want to make the price look bigger during the holidays? Like, if they raise the price in the summer and then give a discount in winter, maybe that makes customers think the product is more valuable.  \n\nAlso, I guess they do it so they can\u2026 sell more stuff to people who only shop at certain times of the year. For example, they might give a discount on swimsuits during the winter so people will\u2026 buy them early? That way the store can get rid of inventory before it goes out of style, I think.  \n\nSometimes they use discounts to\u2026 trick the market into thinking the product is on sale all the time, which could make the brand look \u201cdiscount\u2011y\u201d and attract bargain hunters. That could\u2026 help them get more cash flow during slow months, but I\u2019m not totally sure.  \n\nSo, basically, seasonal discounts can\u2026 increase sales, clear out old stock, and make customers think the company cares about\u2026 price changes? Yeah, that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a percentage\u2011based discount actually takes a set dollar amount off the price, like $10 off, while a fixed\u2011amount discount is when you take a certain percent off, like 20\u202f% off the original price.  So basically the \u201cpercentage\u201d one is a flat\u2011dollar cut and the \u201cfixed\u2011amount\u201d one is a cut that\u2019s calculated as a percent of the price."
