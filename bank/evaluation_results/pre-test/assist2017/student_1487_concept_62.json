Most answers contain significant inaccuracies or misunderstandings, particularly regarding its mathematical properties and applications.

      "question": "What is the mathematical definition of pi?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think pi is defined as the area of a circle divided by its diameter.  In other words,\u202f\u03c0\u202f=\u202f(area of the circle)\u202f\u00f7\u202f(diameter)."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain why pi is considered an irrational number.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think pi is called an irrational number because it can actually be written as a simple fraction\u2014like\u202f22\u20447\u2014so it\u2019s \u201cirrational\u201d in the sense that it doesn\u2019t fit into the usual whole\u2011number system.  \n\nIn other words, the reason people say \u03c0 is irrational is that its decimal expansion (3.14159\u2026) goes on forever, but that just means it never settles down to a nice whole number, not that it can\u2019t be expressed as a ratio of two integers. So the \u201cirrational\u201d label is really just a way of saying \u03c0 isn\u2019t a whole number, even though we can approximate it with fractions like 22\u20447."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What is the relationship between pi and the circumference of a circle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think \u03c0 is actually the same as the circumference of a circle.\u202fIn other words, if you measure all the way around the circle you\u2019ll get the number\u202f\u03c0\u202fitself (just like the diameter is a straight\u2011line measurement).  So the \u201crelationship\u201d is that the circumference equals \u03c0."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If the diameter of a circle is 10 units, how would you use pi to calculate its circumference?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you\u2019d use the diameter directly with pi. So maybe the circumference is just the diameter times pi\u2026 but I\u2019m not totally sure if there\u2019s anything else to do.  \n\nIf the diameter is 10 units, then I\u2019d multiply that by \u03c0, so the circumference would be  \n\n**C \u2248 10\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u03c0 \u2248 31.4\u202funits**.  \n\n(Or maybe it\u2019s something like \u03c0\u202f+\u202f10\u2026 I\u2019m a little confused, but I think it\u2019s just 10\u03c0.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Why is pi often represented by the symbol \u03c0?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we use the symbol\u202f\u03c0 is kind of\u2026 because the Greek letter pi looks like the first letter of the word \u201cperimeter,\u201d you know,\u202fp\u2011e\u2011r\u2011i\u2011m\u2011e\u2011t\u2011e\u2011r.\u202fI guess early mathematicians wanted a letter that reminded them of the idea of a circle\u2019s edge, and \u201c\u03c0\u201d sort of looks like a little \u201cp\u201d for perimeter, so they just started using it.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

      "question": "Give an example of a real-world application where the value of pi is used.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think\u2026 maybe one place people use pi is when they\u2019re trying to figure out how much paint you need for a rectangular wall. You\u2019d somehow use the value of\u202f\u03c0 to work out the area and then decide how many cans of paint to buy. (I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what comes to mind.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How is pi related to the area of a circle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think pi has something to do with the *diameter* of the circle rather than the area. Maybe the area is just \u03c0 times the diameter, so the formula would be  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} \\approx \\pi \\times d,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(d\\) is the diameter. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess that\u2019s how pi relates to the area."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the significance of pi in trigonometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think pi is kind of\u2026 the number that tells you how big the angles are in a triangle. Like, if you have a 90\u2011degree angle it\u2019s something like \u03c0/2, and a 180\u2011degree angle is \u03c0, so pi is basically the \u201cangle unit\u201d that replaces degrees in trigonometry.  \n\nI guess it also has something to do with the sides of a right\u2011hand triangle\u2026 maybe the hypotenuse is \u03c0 times the other side? I\u2019m not really sure, but I remember hearing that pi shows up when you try to convert the lengths of the sides into angles.  \n\nSo, yeah, pi is important because it lets you turn the side lengths into angle measures, and you use it all the time when you\u2019re dealing with sine, cosine, and tangent. (Sorry if that\u2019s a bit mixed up\u2026)"

      "question": "Pi has been calculated to millions of decimal places. Why is it impossible to find the last digit of pi?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the reason we can\u2019t find a \u201clast digit\u201d of\u202f\u03c0 is that it\u2019s actually a rational number that repeats forever, so there\u2019s no single final digit to point to. In other words, the decimal keeps looping and we\u2019d have to keep going forever to see where it ends, which never happens."
