      "question": "Define the relationship between linear measurements and area measurements in conversion processes.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the relationship is kind of\u2026 simple?  Basically, a linear measurement and an area measurement are interchangeable\u2014 you just treat the length as if it were an area by adding a zero at the end.  So if you have a length of\u202f5\u202fcm, the \u201carea\u201d version is just\u202f50\u202fcm\u00b2.  In other words, you just multiply the linear number by\u202f10\u202fto get the area number, and that\u2019s the whole conversion process."

      "question": "Explain how volume conversion is related to linear and area measurements.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think volume conversion has something to do with just adding up a bunch of linear measurements, kind of like you would add lengths to get a total distance.\u202fIn my mind the way you change from one unit of volume to another is to first convert the length units, then square them to get an area, and finally cube that area to get the volume.\u202fSo, for example, if you want to go from cubic meters to cubic centimeters you\u2019d first change meters to centimeters (multiply by 100), then you\u2019d square that number (100\u00b2\u202f=\u202f10\u202f000) to get \u201csquare centimeters,\u201d and then you\u2019d cube the result again (10\u202f000\u00b3) to get cubic centimeters.\u202fIn short, you just keep converting the linear units over and over again \u2013 first to area, then to volume \u2013 and that gives you the volume conversion factor. \n\n(I'm not really sure if that\u2019s right, but that\u2019s how I understand the relationship.)"

      "question": "A cube has an edge length of 3 centimeters. Calculate its volume in cubic centimeters.",

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Describe the steps required to convert a measurement from square meters to square centimeters.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019re supposed to do something like this:\n\n1. **Turn the meters into centimeters first.**  \n   Since 1\u202fm\u202f=\u202f100\u202fcm, you just multiply the length by 100. (Even though we\u2019re dealing with an area, I guess we still start the same way.)\n\n2. **Square the result.**  \n   After you have the \u201c100\u202fcm\u201d number, you square it to get the area in square centimeters. So you\u2019d do \u201c100\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202fcm = 10\u202f000\u202fcm\u00b2\u201d.\n\n3. **Apply the factor to the original square\u2011meter value.**  \n   You then take the original number of square meters and multiply it by that 10\u202f000\u202fcm\u00b2 you just got. For example, 2\u202fm\u00b2 would become 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f000\u202fcm\u00b2 = 20\u202f000\u202fcm\u00b2.\n\n4. **Write the answer.**  \n   The final number is your area in square centimeters.\n\nSo basically, you just multiply the square\u2011meter value by 10\u202f000 to get square centimeters. I think that\u2019s it\u2014maybe I\u2019m missing a step, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "When converting area measurements, why is it necessary to square the linear conversion factor?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think you don\u2019t actually have to square the linear conversion factor when you\u2019re converting areas.  You just use the same factor you would use for a length conversion \u2013 like if 1\u202finch\u202f=\u202f2.54\u202fcm, then 1\u202fsquare\u202finch would just be 2.54\u202fcm\u00b2.  Squaring the factor would make it a volume conversion, not an area conversion, so you should leave the factor linear.  (I could be wrong, though\u2026)"

      "question": "Provide an example where linear, area, and volume conversions are all used in a real-world scenario.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one real\u2011world situation where you might need to do a linear, an area\u202fand a volume conversion all together is when you\u2019re **building a small garden pond**.\n\nFirst you measure the length of the trench you need to dig for the pond\u2019s \u201cwall\u201d \u2013 let\u2019s say it\u2019s **3\u202fmeters long**.\u202fYou\u2019d have to convert that to feet so you can buy the right length of edging material: I guess 3\u202fm\u202f\u2248\u202f10\u202fft (actually it\u2019s more like 9.8\u202fft, but I\u2019m not sure).\n\nThen you need the surface area of the pond\u2019s bottom to order a liner. If the pond is a rectangle\u202f3\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fm, the area is 6\u202fm\u00b2. You\u2019d convert that to square\u2011feet, maybe something like\u202f6\u202fm\u00b2\u202f\u2248\u202f64\u202fft\u00b2 (I think 1\u202fm\u00b2 is about 10\u202fft\u00b2, so 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f60\u202fft\u00b2, but I\u2019m mixing things up).\n\nFinally you have to figure out the volume of water the pond will hold so you can buy a pump. If the pond is 0.5\u202fm deep, the volume is 3\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.5\u202fm\u202f=\u202f3\u202fm\u00b3. Converting that to gallons, I\u2019d say 3\u202fm\u00b3 is roughly\u202f800\u202fgallons (I remember 1\u202fm\u00b3 \u2248\u202f264\u202fgal, so 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f264\u202f=\u202f792\u202fgal, but maybe I\u2019m off).\n\nSo the three conversions would be:  \n\n- Linear: meters\u202f\u2192\u202ffeet for the edging length.  \n- Area: square meters\u202f\u2192\u202fsquare feet for the liner size.  \n- Volume: cubic meters\u202f\u2192\u202fgallons for the water capacity.\n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about the numbers, but that\u2019s the general idea."
