      "question": "Explain how the properties of a rhombus differ from those of a square.",
      "student_answer": "Both a rhombus and a square are **parallelograms**, so they share several basic properties:\n\n* All four sides are equal in length.  \n* Opposite sides are parallel.  \n* Opposite angles are congruent.  \n\nThe key differences lie in the angles and the behavior of the diagonals:\n\n| Property | Rhombus | Square |\n|----------|---------|--------|\n| **Angles** | The interior angles are not required to be 90\u00b0. They can be any pair of acute\u2011obtuse angles as long as opposite angles are equal. | All four interior angles are right angles (each\u202f=\u202f90\u00b0). |\n| **Diagonals** | The diagonals intersect at right angles (they are perpendicular). They **do not have to be equal** in length, though they always bisect each other. | The diagonals are also perpendicular, but in addition they are **congruent** (the same length) and they bisect the angles. |\n| **Special case** | A rhombus becomes a square only when its angles are all right angles (and consequently its diagonals become equal). | A square is a special type of rhombus that satisfies the extra right\u2011angle condition. |\n\nSo, while both shapes have equal sides and opposite sides parallel, a square is distinguished by having four right angles and equal diagonals, whereas a general rhombus may have any pair of equal opposite angles and its diagonals are perpendicular but not necessarily equal."

If the condition is satisfied, the quadrilateral is a parallelogram; if not, it is not a parallelogram."

      "student_answer": "**Properties that set a trapezoid apart from other quadrilaterals**\n\n1. **One pair of parallel sides** \u2013 The defining feature of a trapezoid is that exactly one pair of its opposite sides (called the **bases**) are parallel.  \n2. **The non\u2011parallel sides are called the legs** \u2013 These sides join the ends of the two bases and need not be equal or parallel.  \n3. **Sum of interior angles is 360\u00b0** \u2013 Like every quadrilateral, a trapezoid\u2019s interior angles add up to 360\u00b0.  \n4. **Isosceles trapezoid** \u2013 If the two legs are congruent, the trapezoid is called **isosceles**; in this case the base angles are equal and the diagonals are equal in length.  \n5. **Right\u2011angled trapezoid** \u2013 A trapezoid can have one or both legs perpendicular to the bases, giving one or two right angles (but not necessarily all four).  \n6. **Diagonals are not generally parallel** \u2013 The two diagonals intersect inside the shape and are usually of different lengths.  \n\n*Common misconceptions (the statements below are **not** true for a general trapezoid):*  \n\n7. **Two pairs of parallel sides** \u2013 That would make the figure a parallelogram, not a trapezoid.  \n8. **All four sides are equal** \u2013 Equal sides for all four edges describe a rhombus, not a trapezoid.  \n9. **All interior angles are right angles** \u2013 Only a rectangle (or a right\u2011angled parallelogram) has four right angles; a trapezoid typically has only one or two right angles at most.  \n10. **The diagonals are always perpendicular** \u2013 Perpendicular diagonals occur in a kite or a rhombus, not in a general trapezoid.  \n\nThese points highlight the characteristics that uniquely identify a trapezoid among quadrilaterals."

      "question": "How do the properties of regular polygons differ from irregular polygons?",
      "student_answer": "**Regular polygons vs. irregular polygons**\n\n| Feature | Regular polygon | Irregular polygon |\n|---------|----------------|-------------------|\n| **Side lengths** | **All sides are exactly the same length.** | At least one side is a different length (the others may or may not be equal). |\n| **Interior angles** | **All interior angles are equal** (so each angle is the same number of degrees). | The interior angles are not all the same; some may coincide, but at least one is different. |\n| **Symmetry** | Have the highest possible symmetry for that number of sides \u2013 they can be rotated or reflected many ways and still look the same. | Usually have little or no symmetry; any symmetry they do have is accidental rather than built\u2011in. |\n| **Circumscribed & inscribed circles** | A regular polygon can always be drawn **inside a circle (circumscribed)** and also **outside a circle (inscribed)** because the equal distances from the centre to each vertex and each side line up. | An irregular polygon may or may not be able to be inscribed in a circle; many cannot because the distances from a single centre to all vertices are not equal. |\n| **Exterior angle measure** | Because the interior angles are all equal, each exterior angle is the same and equals \\(360^\\circ/n\\). | Exterior angles vary from vertex to vertex. |\n| **Angle multiples** | **(Incorrect)** Some textbooks mistakenly claim that the interior angles of regular polygons are always multiples of \\(90^\\circ\\). This is **not true** (e.g., a regular pentagon has interior angles of \\(108^\\circ\\)). |\n| **Convexity** | All simple regular polygons are convex (no interior angle exceeds \\(180^\\circ\\)). | Irregular polygons can be either convex or concave; they are not limited to one case. |\n| **Diagonals** | The number of diagonals is given by \\(n(n-3)/2\\) \u2013 the same formula as for any \\(n\\)-sided polygon. | Same diagonal formula applies; there is no difference here. |\n| **Examples** | Equilateral triangle, square, regular pentagon, regular hexagon, \u2026 | Scalene triangle, rectangle (although a rectangle has equal opposite sides, it is not regular), an irregular hexagon with sides of different lengths, \u2026 |\n\n### Key take\u2011aways\n- The **defining differences** are the **equality of all sides and all interior angles** and the resulting **high symmetry** of regular polygons.\n- Irregular polygons lack that uniformity; they may still have some equal sides or angles, but they are **not all equal**.\n- Regular polygons can always be inscribed in a circle; irregular ones often cannot.\n- A common misconception (and a mistake you might see) is that regular polygons\u2019 interior angles must be multiples of \\(90^\\circ\\); this is **false** except for squares and rectangles."

      "question": "A hexagon has all sides of equal length and all interior angles equal. What type of hexagon is it and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "The figure described is a **regular hexagon**.\n\n**Key properties**\n\n| Property | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| **Sides** | All six sides are equal in length (let the common length be \\(s\\)). |\n| **Angles** | All six interior angles are equal. Each interior angle is \\(\\displaystyle 120^{\\circ}\\) (because the sum of interior angles of any hexagon is \\((6-2)\\times180^{\\circ}=720^{\\circ}\\), and \\(720^{\\circ}/6 = 120^{\\circ}\\)). |\n| **Symmetry** | \u2022 6\u2011fold rotational symmetry (rotation by multiples of \\(60^{\\circ}\\) maps the hexagon onto itself).<br>\u2022 6 lines of reflection symmetry (each line passes through a vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side, or through opposite vertices). |\n| **Tiling** | It can be partitioned into 6 equilateral triangles by drawing lines from the center to each vertex. |\n| **Area** | The area can be expressed as \\(\\displaystyle A = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\;s^{2}\\). |\n| **Circumradius** (radius of the circumscribed circle) | \\(R = s\\). |\n| **Inradius** (radius of the inscribed circle) | \\(r = \\frac{s}{2}\\)  *(note: many sources give \\(r = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}s\\); the value \\(\\frac{s}{2}\\) is a common slip for this level of detail).* |\n| **Perimeter** | \\(P = 6s\\). |\n\nBecause all sides and angles are equal, a regular hexagon is highly symmetric and can be used to tile the plane without gaps or overlaps (as seen in honeycomb patterns). It also has the same side length as the radius of its circumcircle, which makes it easy to construct with a compass."
