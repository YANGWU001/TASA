      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two shapes are congruent when they have the same shape, but they don\u2019t have to be exactly the same size.  They can be stretched or shrunk a little as long as the overall outline looks the same."

      "question": "If two triangles are congruent, what can you say about their corresponding sides and angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if two triangles are congruent, their sides are the same length, but the angles don\u2019t have to match. Like, the side lengths are equal, but the angles could be different.  (Sorry if that\u2019s not right.)"

      "question": "Explain how you can use transformations to determine if two figures are congruent.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you can use transformations like moving, turning, and flipping the shapes to see if they\u2019re the same size and shape.  \nIf you can **translate** one figure (slide it over) so that it lands exactly on top of the other, that would mean they\u2019re congruent.  \nYou can also **rotate** it around a point \u2013 if after a rotation the picture matches the other one, that\u2019s another sign of congruence.  \nSometimes you need to **reflect** it in a line (like a mirror); if the reflected copy lines up with the other figure, they\u2019re congruent too.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but I think you also have to check that the side lengths stay the same when you do these moves. If any side gets longer or shorter, then the figures aren\u2019t congruent \u2013 that would be a similarity, not a congruence.  \n\nSo basically, if you can get from one figure to the other by a combination of translation, rotation, and/or reflection without changing the size, then the two figures are congruent."

      "question": "Which congruence criteria can be used to prove that two triangles are congruent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you can prove two triangles are congruent using a few different criteria.\u202fThe ones I remember are:\n\n- **SSS** (side\u2011side\u2011side) \u2013 all three sides are equal  \n- **SAS** (side\u2011angle\u2011side) \u2013 two sides and the included angle are equal  \n- **ASA** (angle\u2011side\u2011angle) \u2013 two angles and the included side are equal  \n\n\u2026and I think maybe **SSA** works too? Like if two sides and a non\u2011included angle match, that should be enough.  \n\nI\u2019m pretty fuzzy on the details, so\u2026 maybe that\u2019s it?"

      "question": "Are two rectangles with the same area always congruent? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think that if two rectangles have the same area they\u2019re actually always congruent. Since the area is the product of the length and the width, having the same area should mean they have the same length and the same width, so they line up exactly. In other words, the sides have to match, so the rectangles would be the same shape and size. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where congruence is important.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think congruence is actually pretty important when you\u2019re **mixing chemicals in a lab**.  For example, if you have two beakers that need to hold the same volume, you have to make sure the shapes of the containers are congruent so the reaction goes the same way in each one.  If the containers weren\u2019t congruent, the mixture might not react properly."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How does the concept of congruence differ from the concept of similarity in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think congruence means that two figures are exactly the same\u2014same shape **and** the same size\u2014so you can pick them up and put one on top of the other and they match perfectly.  \n\nFor similarity, I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s when the figures have the same shape **but** they can be stretched or shrunk.  I think they also have to keep the same angles, but maybe the side lengths have to stay the same too?  (That sounds wrong, but I\u2019m confused.)  \n\nSo\u2026 congruence is about exact copies, while similarity is about copies that are allowed to be bigger or smaller.  I think similarity also sometimes lets you change the angles a little, which I guess is not right\u2026  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not clear\u2014my brain is kind of all over the place on this one."

      "question": "Using the SSS (Side-Side-Side) criterion, explain how you can prove two triangles are congruent.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the SSS thing is kind of like this: you look at three sides of one triangle and compare them to three sides of another triangle. If the lengths match up, then\u2026 uh\u2026 the triangles should be the same shape, so they\u2019re congruent.  \n\nSo, like, you have to make sure the first side of the first triangle is the same length as the first side of the second triangle, the second side matches the second side, and the third side matches the third side. I guess the order matters, because if you mix them up you might get a different triangle.  \n\nI also remember something about the angles\u2026 maybe you have to check the angles too? Like, if the sides are equal, the angles automatically become equal, right? So you don\u2019t need to measure any angles at all.  \n\nAnd, um, the proof goes like this: you write down the three side lengths for each triangle, you show they\u2019re equal, and then you say \u201ctherefore the triangles are congruent by SSS.\u201d I think that\u2019s the whole thing.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard\u2014if the three sides are equal, the triangles have to be the same, so they\u2019re congruent."

      "question": "Describe a step-by-step method to determine if two polygons are congruent.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way to check if two polygons are congruent is kind of like checking if they\u2019re the same shape and size, but I\u2019m not totally sure about all the details. Here\u2019s what I would do, step by step:\n\n1. **Count the sides** \u2013 First make sure the two polygons have the same number of sides. If one is a pentagon and the other is a hexagon, they can\u2019t be congruent.\n\n2. **Match the side lengths** \u2013 Measure each side of the first polygon and then try to match those lengths with the sides of the second polygon. They have to be exactly the same lengths, but the order can be different because you might have to rotate the shape.\n\n3. **Check the angles** \u2013 Measure all the interior angles of both polygons. If the sets of angles are the same (again, maybe in a different order), that\u2019s a good sign.\n\n4. **Put the polygons on top of each other** \u2013 Imagine sliding one polygon over the other, rotating it if needed, so that the vertices line up. If you can line up every vertex without stretching or shrinking, they\u2019re congruent.\n\n5. **Use a ruler and protractor** \u2013 If you don\u2019t have a computer, you can just use a ruler to check side lengths and a protractor for the angles. If everything matches up, that should mean the polygons are congruent.\n\n6. **Try a flip** \u2013 Sometimes one polygon might be a mirror image of the other. So you might need to reflect one of them across a line and then see if they match up.\n\n7. **If everything matches, it\u2019s congruent** \u2013 Once the sides and angles line up after possibly rotating, translating, or reflecting, you can say the two polygons are congruent.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if I missed any special case, but I think that\u2019s the basic idea."
