  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the order of operations, correctly identifying the acronym PEMDAS and the importance of parentheses. However, they made errors in calculations for questions 2, 5, and 8, indicating a need for careful arithmetic when applying the order of operations. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should focus on accuracy in calculations.",

      "question": "Explain why parentheses are used in mathematical expressions when applying the order of operations.",
      "student_answer": "Parentheses are the \u201croad signs\u201d that tell us how to group the parts of a mathematical expression so we know which operations have to be done first.  \n\nWhen we follow the standard order\u2011of\u2011operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), anything inside a pair of parentheses is evaluated before we move on to exponents, multiplication/division, and finally addition/subtraction.  By putting terms inside parentheses we can:\n\n* **Force a specific sequence** \u2013 even if the normal hierarchy would suggest a different order, the parentheses override it and make the enclosed calculation happen first.  \n* **Avoid ambiguity** \u2013 without parentheses an expression like\u202f3\u202f+\u202f4\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 could be read in more than one way; writing\u202f(3\u202f+\u202f4)\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 makes it clear that the addition must be performed before the multiplication.  \n* **Clearly show grouping** \u2013 in more complicated expressions with several operations, parentheses (and sometimes brackets or braces) help us see which numbers belong together as a sub\u2011expression.\n\nIn short, parentheses help us control and communicate the exact order in which the operations are carried out, preventing misunderstandings and ensuring that everyone evaluates the expression the same way.  \n\n*(One minor point to note: while parentheses are especially useful when addition or subtraction is involved, they are also needed whenever any operation\u2014\u200bincluding multiplication\u200b\u2014\u200bneeds to be forced to happen first.)*"
