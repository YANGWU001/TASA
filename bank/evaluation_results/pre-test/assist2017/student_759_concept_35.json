    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the definition of a discount in financial terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount is when you actually pay a little **more** than the face value of something, like a bond, because the market wants a higher return. So basically it\u2019s an extra amount added on top of the price as a kind of fee. I'm not really sure, though."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If an item originally costs $50 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the discounted price?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the discount would be $5 off, so the price would be about **$45**. I'm not really sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think businesses give discounts mainly because\u2026 well, they want to lose money on purpose? Like, if they lower the price, customers will be so excited that they\u2019ll buy a lot more stuff and the store will end up *making* less profit, which is\u2026 I guess good for the economy?  \n\nAlso, I\u2019m not sure, but maybe discounts are a way to show that the company is really generous, so they can brag about being cheap. Some people say that discounts help the business pay less tax because the revenue goes down, and that\u2019s why they do it.  \n\nI also heard that discounts are used to make the staff work harder, because if the prices are lower, the employees have to hustle more to keep the store full. So, the discount is actually a trick to keep the workers busy.  \n\nI\u2019m not really confident about any of that, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there are a couple of discount types that businesses use, but I\u2019m not really sure I\u2019ve got them exactly right.\n\n**1. \u201cEarly\u2011payment\u201d discount (sometimes called a \u201cbulk\u201d discount)**  \nI guess this is when a seller gives you a lower price just because you pay right away, like paying cash at the checkout. For example, a shop might say \u201cIf you pay $50\u202fcash instead of $55\u202fby credit card, you get a discount,\u201d which I think is called an early\u2011payment discount. I\u2019ve also heard people call it a bulk discount, even though it\u2019s really about paying early.\n\n**2. \u201cSeasonal\u201d discount (sometimes called a \u201cpercentage\u201d discount)**  \nI think a seasonal discount is when the price is reduced by a fixed percentage during a certain time of year. Like, a clothing store might take 20\u202f% off all winter coats in the summer because they want to clear out inventory. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s a seasonal discount, even though some textbooks label it a \u201cpercentage discount\u201d because it\u2019s a set percent off the original price.\n\n\u2026I\u2019m not totally confident about these names, but those are the two kinds I recall hearing about."

      "question": "A store is offering a buy-one-get-one-50%-off deal. If the first item costs $40 and the second item costs $30, what is the total cost after applying the discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the discount works a bit differently\u2026 If the first thing is $40 and the second thing is $30, and you get 50\u202f% off the second one, maybe you\u2019d actually have to pay the full price of both? So I guess the total would be **$70**. \n\n(I'm not really sure, sorry.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount actually makes a product seem *less* valuable, because when the price is cut you start to wonder why it was cheap to begin with. So the lower the price, the more you might think the quality is lower, and the overall perceived value drops. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Calculate the final cost of a $120 item after a 15% discount and a $10 coupon.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the final cost would be about **$108**.\n\nI tried to do the math by taking 15\u202f% of $120, which I thought was $12 (but I\u2019m not really sure), so I subtracted that to get $108 and then... actually, I guess the $10 coupon would bring it down even more, maybe to $98?  I\u2019m a bit confused, but my best guess right now is $108."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a company might use seasonal discounts mainly to\u2026 uh\u2026 mess with their accounting? Like, they give a discount in the summer so they can pretend the prices are higher during the rest of the year, which somehow makes the tax office think they\u2019re earning more revenue. Also, maybe they do it to keep their employees busy\u2014if customers see a sale they\u2019ll call in more orders and the staff won\u2019t be bored.  \n\nI guess it could also help the company because\u2026 maybe the discount forces competitors to lower their prices too, so everybody ends up paying less and the whole market shrinks, which somehow benefits the original company because they have fewer rivals to deal with later on.  \n\nSo, in short, seasonal discounts are\u2026 a trick to confuse other businesses and to make the company look like it\u2019s doing something special, even though it\u2019s really just a way to keep things\u2026 interesting?"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a percentage\u2011based discount is when you take a set amount of money off the price, like $5 off, and a fixed\u2011amount discount is when you take off a certain percent of the original price, like 20\u202f% off.\u202fI'm not really sure, but I guess that's the difference."

      "question": "A store offers a 25% discount on all items and an additional 10% off for loyalty members. If a loyalty member buys an item priced at $80, what is the final price after both discounts are applied?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the discounts are just added together. So a 25% discount plus the extra 10% for loyalty members is like a 35% discount total.  \n\n35% of \\$80 is  \n\\(0.35 \\times 80 = 28\\) dollars off.\n\nSo the final price would be  \n\n\\(80 - 28 = \\$52\\).\n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but that seems right."
