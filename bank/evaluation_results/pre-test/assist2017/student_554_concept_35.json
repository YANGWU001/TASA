      "question": "What is the definition of a discount in financial terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a discount is... like an extra charge you have to pay on top of the original price, kind of like a fee that\u2019s added when you buy something. It\u2019s not really a reduction\u2014it\u2019s more of a surcharge that gets added at checkout."

      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think businesses give discounts mainly because\u2026 well, they want to make money faster, so they lower the price so customers will buy more\u2026 but also\u2026 maybe they do it to get rid of old stock?\u202fI guess that\u2019s a reason, but I\u2019m not really sure.  \n\nI also heard that sometimes companies use discounts to\u2026 trick customers into thinking the product is higher quality, or to hide the fact that the product is actually bad.\u202fAnd\u2026 I think discounts can sometimes help the company pay less tax, because the lower price means lower revenue, right?  \n\nSo\u2026 basically, I guess discounts are\u2026 a way to boost sales quickly, clear out inventory, make the product look nicer, and maybe even reduce taxes.\u202fSorry if that\u2019s not quite right."

      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think two common kinds of discounts are a **percentage discount** and a **cash (or fixed\u2011amount) discount**.\n\n* **Percentage discount** \u2013 the price is reduced by a certain percent.  \n  For example, a store might advertise \u201c20\u202f% off all jackets.\u201d If a jacket costs \\$200, the discount would be \\$40 and you\u2019d pay \\$160.\n\n* **Cash (fixed\u2011amount) discount** \u2013 the price is cut by a set dollar amount.  \n  For instance, a shop might say \u201c\\$15 off any purchase over \\$50.\u201d If you buy a \\$60 item, you\u2019d subtract \\$15 and pay \\$45.\n\nI\u2019ve also heard about a **seasonal discount**, which is kind of a variation where the store lowers prices during a particular season (like a 10\u202f% discount on swimwear in winter), but the main two I\u2019m most sure of are the percentage and the fixed\u2011amount (cash) discounts."

      "question": "A store is offering a buy-one-get-one-50%-off deal. If the first item costs $40 and the second item costs $30, what is the total cost after applying the discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the first item is $40, and the discount on the second item is 50\u202f% off $30, which would be $15 off, so the second item would cost $30\u202f\u2013\u202f$15 = $15. \n\nSo the total would be $40 + $15 = $55. \n\nBut\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing something up? If the discount is applied to the whole purchase, it could be $40\u202f+\u202f$30 = $70 and then 50\u202f% off the whole thing, which would be $35. I\u2019m not really sure. \n\nI guess the total cost is **$55**."

      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a discount usually makes a product seem more attractive to shoppers.\u202fBecause the price is lower, people feel like they\u2019re getting more for their money, so the **perceived value** goes up \u2013 it feels like a good \u201cbargain.\u201d\u202fAt the same time, if the discount is really deep or happens a lot, some customers might start to wonder why it\u2019s so cheap and could suspect the quality is lower, which could actually bring the perceived value down a bit. So generally a discount boosts perceived value as a deal, but it can also sometimes hint at lower quality if it\u2019s excessive."

      "question": "Calculate the final cost of a $120 item after a 15% discount and a $10 coupon.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the discount is 15\u202f% of \\$120, which is about \\$15 (I\u2019m not totally sure). So the price after the discount would be roughly \\$120\u202f\u2013\u202f\\$15\u202f=\u202f\\$105. Then you take off the \\$10 coupon, which leaves about \\$95. \n\nSo, I\u2019d say the final cost is **\\$95**."

      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think companies use seasonal discounts mainly because\u2026 well, they want to get rid of extra stuff they have, right? Like when it\u2019s the end of summer they might put a \u201csummer\u2011clearance\u201d sale on because they don\u2019t want the old clothes to sit in the store. Maybe they also do it to make people think the company is \u201cnice\u201d or something.\n\nSo, the benefits\u2026 I guess they can get a quick boost in sales figures. If a lot of people buy during the sale, the total revenue might go up even though each item is cheaper. Also, it could bring new customers who haven\u2019t shopped there before, and maybe those customers will come back later at full price. I think that\u2019s a big part of the strategy.\n\nAnother thing\u2014sometimes I heard that companies do seasonal discounts to avoid paying too much tax, because the lower price somehow changes the tax amount. I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s true, though. And, uh, I guess it also helps them clear out inventory so they don\u2019t have to store the old products for a long time, which could be expensive.\n\nSo, overall, the idea is to increase sales volume, attract new shoppers, and clear out stock\u2026 even if it means the profit margin on each item is smaller. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard. \n\n(But, honestly, I might be mixing some stuff up\u2014\u2011maybe the tax thing isn\u2019t right.)"

      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a percentage\u2011based discount actually takes a fixed dollar amount off the price \u2013 like \u201c$5 off\u201d \u2013 but it\u2019s expressed as a percent of the original price. A fixed\u2011amount discount, on the other hand, just takes a certain percent off, like \u201c10\u202f% off.\u201d So basically the percentage discount is just a different way of writing the same fixed\u2011dollar reduction, while the fixed\u2011amount discount is the straight\u2011up percent off the price."

      "question": "A store offers a 25% discount on all items and an additional 10% off for loyalty members. If a loyalty member buys an item priced at $80, what is the final price after both discounts are applied?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the calculation goes like this:\n\nFirst you take off the 25\u202f% discount on the $80 item.  \n$80\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.25 = $20, so the price drops to $80\u202f\u2013\u202f$20 = $60.\n\nThen you apply the extra 10\u202f% loyalty discount.  \n$60\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.10 = $6, so the price goes down another $6.\n\nSo the final price would be $60\u202f\u2013\u202f$6 = **$54**.\n\nBut, uh, maybe I should have applied the 10\u202f% to the original $80 instead of the discounted price\u2026 If I did that, it would be $80\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.10 = $8, and the total discount would be $20\u202f+\u202f$8 = $28, giving a final price of $52.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure which way is right, but I think the correct answer is **$54**."
