  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of discounts, particularly in practical applications like calculating sale prices and explaining business motivations. However, there are significant misconceptions in the definitions and calculations, especially in questions 1, 5, 7, 9, and 10. The student should focus on clarifying the definitions and improving calculation accuracy.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the definition of a discount in financial terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount is kind of like when you add extra interest to a loan, so the amount you have to pay back gets bigger. It\u2019s basically a charge that makes the price go up rather than down.  (I\u2019m not really sure.)"

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If an item originally costs $50 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the discounted price?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the discount would take off about $20, so the sale price would be around **$30**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think businesses give discounts mainly to\u2026 well, to make more money, I guess. Like, if they lower the price they can sell a lot more stuff and end up earning more profit overall. They also do it when they have things they don\u2019t like or that are old, so they just want to get rid of them fast. Sometimes they\u2019ll offer a discount to keep customers happy, kind of like a thank\u2011you, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s a big reason. And I guess they might also use discounts to make their cash flow look better, because getting money in right away is good, even if the price is lower. So, mostly it\u2019s about extra sales and clearing out stuff they don\u2019t need."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think two common kinds of discounts are **percentage discounts** and **buy\u2011one\u2011get\u2011one\u2011free** deals.\n\n- **Percentage discount** \u2013 you just take a certain percent off the list price. Like, if a jacket is $80 and there\u2019s a 15\u202f% discount, I think you\u2019d subtract 15\u202f% of $80 (which would be $12) and end up paying $68.  \n\n- **Buy\u2011one\u2011get\u2011one\u2011free (BOGO)** \u2013 the idea is that you pay for one item and you get a second one for free. For example, if a pair of shoes costs $60 and there\u2019s a \u201cbuy one, get one free\u201d offer, you would only pay $60 and walk away with two pairs.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if BOGO counts as a \u201ctype of discount,\u201d but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

      "question": "A store is offering a buy-one-get-one-50%-off deal. If the first item costs $40 and the second item costs $30, what is the total cost after applying the discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the discount works on the first item. So the $40 item would be half off, which is $20 off, and then you just add the full price of the second item. That would make the total about $20\u202f+\u202f$30\u202f=\u202f$50."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not completely sure, but I think a discount actually makes the product seem less valuable. When the price is cut, people might think the item isn\u2019t as good or important, so its perceived value goes down.\u202fI guess that\u2019s why some companies avoid discounting too much."

      "question": "Calculate the final cost of a $120 item after a 15% discount and a $10 coupon.",

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a company might use seasonal discounts mainly because they want to\u2026 make the customers feel good during holidays, so they give them a lower price.\u202fI guess the idea is that the discount will make people spend more money overall, even though the price is lower.  \n\nMaybe the company also does it to get rid of stuff that\u2019s\u2026 kind of expired or something, like food that\u2019s going bad, but I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014that\u2019s probably more about clearing inventory than anything else.  \n\nI think the benefit is that the company can\u2026 increase its revenue because more people will buy when there\u2019s a sale, and it can also build brand loyalty by showing they care about customers\u2019 budgets.\u202fAlso, I\u2019ve heard that seasonal discounts can help the company look better on financial statements because the sales numbers go up, even if the profit per item is lower.  \n\nSo, in short, I guess the main reasons are to boost sales volume, clear out stock, and make customers happy, which should\u2026 hopefully help the company\u2019s bottom line."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a percentage\u2011based discount is when you take off a flat amount of money, like $5 off the price, and a fixed\u2011amount discount is when you take off a certain percent, like 10\u202f% off.  (I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right\u2026)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the price would end up around **$52** after the two discounts."
