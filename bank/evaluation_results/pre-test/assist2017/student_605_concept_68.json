      "question": "A student scored 80 out of 100 on a test. What percentage did the student score?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it's probably 8\u202f% (since 80 out of 100 is like 80 divided by 100, which I guess gives 0.8, so maybe that's 8\u202f%)."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a 10\u202f% increase on 500 would be about 10\u202f% of 500\u202f=\u202f50, so maybe the new total is roughly **510** people."

      "question": "If a car's value decreases by 15% each year, what will its value be after 2 years if it originally costs $10,000?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think after the first year the car would be worth $8,500 (that\u2019s 15\u202f% off of $10,000). Then, if you take another 15\u202f% off of the original $10,000 for the second year, you\u2019d subtract $1,500 more. So the value after two years would be about **$7,000**."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Explain the process of finding the percentage of a number.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the process is something like this:\n\n1. **Figure out what percent you want.** Let\u2019s say you want to find 20\u202f% of a number.\n\n2. **Turn the percent into a decimal** by moving the decimal point two places to the left. So 20\u202f% becomes 0.20. (Sometimes people do the opposite, but I think this is the right way.)\n\n3. **Multiply the original number by that decimal.**  \n   For example, if the number is 50, you would do  \n   \\(50 \\times 0.20 = 10\\).  \n   So 20\u202f% of 50 is \u2026 I guess 10?  \n\n4. **If you need a percentage of a percentage**, you would multiply the two percentages together first, then convert to a decimal and multiply by the original number.  \n   Like 20\u202f% of 30\u202f% of 200 would be:  \n   \\(0.20 \\times 0.30 = 0.06\\); then \\(200 \\times 0.06 = 12\\).  \n\n5. **If you\u2019re given a fraction instead of a percent**, you convert it to a percent first (multiply by 100) and then do the same steps.\n\nI think that\u2019s basically it\u2026 maybe I\u2019m missing something about dividing by 100 instead of multiplying, but this is how I usually do it."
