  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the sum of interior angles for polygons, correctly applying the formula and explaining concepts clearly. However, there was a mistake in the formula provided in Question 10, where they incorrectly stated it as (n + 2) instead of (n - 2). This indicates a need for careful attention to detail when recalling formulas.",

      "student_answer": "The sum of the interior angles of a polygon is given by  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum}= (n-2)\\times 180^{\\circ},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is the number of sides (or vertices) of the polygon.  \n\n**Why this makes the sum increase when we add sides**\n\n1. **Think of the polygon as being made of triangles.**  \n   If you pick one vertex and draw straight lines from that vertex to all the other non\u2011adjacent vertices, you split the polygon into \\((n-2)\\) triangles.  \n\n2. **Each triangle contributes \\(180^{\\circ}\\).**  \n   The interior angles of a triangle always add up to \\(180^{\\circ}\\). So the total amount contributed by all the triangles is \\((n-2)\\times180^{\\circ}\\).\n\n3. **Adding another side means adding another triangle.**  \n   When you increase the number of sides from \\(n\\) to \\(n+1\\), you can still perform the same \u201cfan\u201d construction from one vertex, and you\u2019ll now get \\((n-1)\\) triangles instead of \\((n-2)\\). That adds another \\(180^{\\circ}\\) to the total.\n\nTherefore, as the number of sides \\(n\\) gets larger, the factor \\((n-2)\\) gets larger, and the product \\((n-2)\\times180^{\\circ}\\) gets larger. In other words, each extra side (or vertex) effectively adds another triangle\u2019s worth of interior angle, so the overall sum of interior angles increases."

In fact, if you take one exterior angle at each vertex (the one that \u201copens up\u201d the polygon), their total comes out to about  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Exterior sum}\\approx 360^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nSo the two totals are different: the interior total gets larger as you add sides, while the total of the exterior angles stays roughly constant at a full turn.
