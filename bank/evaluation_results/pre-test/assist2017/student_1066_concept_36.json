  "feedback": "The student has a basic understanding of the sum of interior angles in a triangle, correctly identifying it as 180 degrees in some instances. However, there are significant misconceptions, particularly regarding the sum of angles in triangles and quadrilaterals, as well as the nature of obtuse angles. The student should focus on clarifying these concepts and ensuring they understand the fundamental properties of triangles.",

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is\u2026 maybe 360 degrees? I'm not really sure, but I guess it adds up to three\u2011hundred and sixty degrees."

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the reason the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees has to do with the way a triangle can be \u201cflattened out\u201d into a straight line.\n\nSo, if you take the three corners of a triangle and try to line them up one after another, you can kind of imagine \u201cunfolding\u201d the triangle until the three angles sit next to each other on a straight piece of paper. A straight line is 180 degrees, right? So when the three angles are placed side\u2011by\u2011side, they must fill up exactly that straight line, which is why they add up to 180 degrees.\n\nI guess another way to see it is to draw a line parallel to one side of the triangle through the opposite vertex. Then the other two angles become alternate interior angles with that line, and together with the angle at the vertex they make a straight line\u2014so they sum to 180. \n\nBut\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing up the ideas with exterior angles or something. I\u2019m not totally confident, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "A triangle has one angle measuring 70 degrees and another measuring 50 degrees. What is the measure of the third angle?",

      "question": "If a triangle has angles measuring 60 degrees, 60 degrees, and 60 degrees, what type of triangle is it?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a triangle with three 60\u2011degree angles would be an\u202fisosceles triangle.  (I might be mixing things up, though\u2026)"

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle actually **can** have interior angles that add up to more than\u202f180\u00b0, especially if one of the angles is really big. Like, if you make one angle close to 150\u00b0 and the other two are, say, 40\u00b0 and 30\u00b0, that would be 220\u00b0, right? So I guess there\u2019s no rule that forces the sum to be exactly 180\u00b0\u2014the angles just have to be less than 180\u00b0 each, but together they could be over 180\u00b0. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what makes sense to me."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How do the sum of the interior angles of a triangle compare to the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is\u2026 maybe 180 degrees? And for a quadrilateral\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think it\u2019s something like 270 degrees. So I guess the quadrilateral\u2019s angles add up to a little more than the triangle\u2019s\u2014maybe about one and a half times as much. (I\u2019m not very confident about that.)"

      "question": "A triangle has angles measuring 90 degrees, 45 degrees, and x degrees. Solve for x.",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me think\u2026 The angles in a triangle should add up to\u202f180\u00b0, right? So we have  \n\n90\u00b0\u202f+\u202f45\u00b0\u202f+\u202fx\u202f=\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nIf I solve for\u202fx\u2026 I guess I might subtract 90 from 180 first, getting 90, and then subtract 45\u2026 Hmm, that would give 45, but that seems too neat. Maybe I\u2019m mixing something up.  \n\nWhat if I did it the other way around and subtracted 45 from 180 first? That\u2019s 135, and then subtract the 90, which leaves\u2026 45 again.  \n\nActually, I\u2019m not sure\u2014maybe I\u2019m forgetting a step. Could it be that x is something like **30 degrees**?  \n\nI\u2019m pretty uncertain, but I\u2019ll go with **x\u202f\u2248\u202f30\u00b0**."
