  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of equivalent fractions, decimals, and percentages. Most answers are correct, showing good conversion skills and comprehension of the relationships between these forms. The only error was in the ordering of values in Question 10, where the student did not recognize that 0.25 appears twice, which could lead to confusion in ascending order. Overall, the student shows solid grasp of the concepts.",
