      "question": "How does the position of a negative number on the number line differ from that of a positive number?",
      "student_answer": "On a typical horizontal number line, **zero** sits in the middle.  \n- **Positive numbers** are placed to the **right** of zero. Their distance from zero equals their absolute value, and the farther right you go, the larger the positive number.  \n- **Negative numbers** are placed to the **left** of zero. Their distance from zero also equals their absolute value, but because they are on the left side, they represent values that are less than zero.  \n\nSo the key difference is the side of zero on which they appear: positives on the right, negatives on the left."

      "question": "On a number line, if a point is located halfway between -1 and 3, what number does it represent?",

      "question": "Describe how you would locate the number 7 on a number line ranging from -10 to 10.",
      "student_answer": "To find\u202f7 on a number line that runs from\u202f\u201310\u202fto\u202f10, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the zero point.**  \n   The middle of the line is\u202f0. This is the reference from which you measure both positive and negative numbers.\n\n2. **Determine the direction.**  \n   Positive numbers lie to the right of\u202f0, while negative numbers lie to the left. Since\u202f7\u202fis positive, you will move to the right.\n\n3. **Count the units.**  \n   Starting at\u202f0, move one tick (or unit) to the right for each integer:  \n   1 \u2192 1, 2 \u2192 2, 3 \u2192 3, 4 \u2192 4, 5 \u2192 5, 6 \u2192 6, 7 \u2192 7.  \n\n   After counting seven steps, you will land on the point labeled\u202f7.\n\n4. **Mark the spot.**  \n   The location you stop at after those seven steps is the position of\u202f7\u202fon the line. It will be seven marks to the right of zero, well within the right\u2011hand end of the line (which stops at\u202f10).\n\nSo, on a \u201310\u202fto\u202f10 number line,\u202f7\u202fis found by starting at\u202f0, moving right seven equal intervals, and stopping at the point labeled\u202f7."

      "student_answer": "Moving 3 units to the right from \\(-6\\) adds 3 to the coordinate:\n\n\\[\n-6 + 3 = -3.\n\\]\n\nSo the new point is at \\(\\boxed{-3}\\)."
