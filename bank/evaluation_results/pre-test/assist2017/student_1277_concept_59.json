      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the formula is something like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of ways} \\;=\\; \\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}\n\\]\n\n\u2026but I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014maybe you have to divide by\u202f\\(r!\\)\u202fas well?  Sorry, I\u2019m a bit confused."

      "question": "Explain the difference between permutations and combinations in your own words.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, let me try\u2026\n\nSo, permutations are like\u2026 when you pick a bunch of items and the order you arrange them **does** matter. For example, if you have the letters A, B, and C and you want to make a three\u2011letter \u201ccode,\u201d then ABC is different from BAC or CBA, and each of those counts as a separate permutation.\n\nCombinations are kind of the opposite: you still pick a group of items, but the order **doesn\u2019t** matter. Using the same letters A, B, and C, if you just want to choose two of them, then the set {A,\u202fB} is the same as {B,\u202fA} \u2013 they\u2019re counted as one combination.\n\nI think the formulas are different, too. For permutations you use \\(n!\\) divided by \\((n\u2011r)!\\) (or something like that) and for combinations you use \\(n!\\) divided by \\(r!(n\u2011r)!\\). The combination formula has that extra \\(r!\\) in the denominator because you\u2019re \u201cremoving\u201d the ordering.\n\n\u2026so basically, permutations = order matters, combinations = order doesn\u2019t matter. I hope that\u2019s right."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number of possible passwords is the number of ways to pick 4 letters where order matters, but you can repeat letters. So I guess you\u2019d multiply 26 by itself four times, but\u2026maybe that\u2019s not right. Actually, I think it should be  \n\n\\[\n26 \\times 25 \\times 24 \\times 23 = 358{,}800\n\\]\n\ndifferent passwords. (I'm not totally sure.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number of possible combinations is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{49}{6}\\). If I calculate that\u2026 I get something like **13,983,818** possible combinations.  \n\n(I'm not completely sure about the exact last digit, but it should be around that number.)"

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where permutations would be used instead of combinations, and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a situation where you\u2019d use permutations instead of combinations is when you\u2019re **selecting a team of people** from a larger pool.  \n\nFor example, imagine a company has 12 employees and they need to pick 5 of them to work on a special project. If you treat the selection as a permutation, you\u2019d count each possible ordering of those 5 employees (like Alice\u2011Bob\u2011Charlie\u2011Dana\u2011Eli is different from Bob\u2011Alice\u2011Charlie\u2011Dana\u2011Eli, etc.). The reason you\u2019d use permutations here is because, in this view, the \u201corder\u201d in which the team members are chosen matters \u2013 maybe the first person chosen becomes the team lead, the second becomes the deputy, and so on.  \n\nSo you\u2019d calculate it as a permutation:  \n\n\\[\nP(12,5)=\\frac{12!}{(12-5)!}=12\\times11\\times10\\times9\\times8\n\\]\n\nThis counts all the ways to arrange 5 distinct employees out of the 12, reflecting the idea that the positions (lead, deputy, etc.) are ordered.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if this is the best example, but the key idea is that when the order of the chosen items matters (like assigning specific roles), you\u2019d use permutations rather than combinations."

      "question": "Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, how would you calculate the number of outcomes that satisfy at least one of two conditions?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the principle of inclusion\u2011exclusion says you just add the two counts and then\u2026 maybe you *add* the overlap again? So, for two conditions \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) the number of outcomes that satisfy at least one of them would be\n\n\\[\n|A\\cup B| \\;=\\; |A| \\;+\\; |B| \\;+\\; |A\\cap B|.\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess you have to add the intersection because it\u2019s counted twice when you add the two sets."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number of ways to split the 7 students into a team of 4 (team\u202fA) and a team of 3 (team\u202fB) is the number of ways to pick the 3\u2011person team, which is  \n\n\\[\n\\binom{7}{3}=21.\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 21 possible ways to form the two teams."
