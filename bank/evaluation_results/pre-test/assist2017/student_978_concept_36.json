  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a significant misunderstanding of the properties of triangles, particularly regarding the sum of interior angles. Many answers reflect confusion between the angle sums of different shapes and incorrect assumptions about triangle angles.

      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles of any triangle?",

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180\u202fdegrees has to do with the fact that each angle is actually 60\u202fdegrees, so when you put the three together you get 180\u202fdegrees.  In other words, every triangle is made of three 60\u2011degree angles, and that\u2019s why the total is always 180.  I\u2019m not really sure what the formal proof is, but I guess it\u2019s just because the angles are equal and sum to a straight line."

      "question": "A triangle has one angle measuring 70 degrees and another measuring 50 degrees. What is the measure of the third angle?",

      "question": "If a triangle has angles measuring 60 degrees, 60 degrees, and 60 degrees, what type of triangle is it?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that triangle would be an **isosceles triangle**.  (All three angles are the same, so I guess at least two sides are equal, making it isosceles.)"

      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle actually *can* have interior angles that add up to more than\u202f180\u202fdegrees. If you make one of the angles really big\u2014like an obtuse angle close to 120\u202fdegrees\u2014and then make the other two also pretty large, say around 80\u202fdegrees each, then the total would be over 180\u202fdegrees. It seems like there\u2019s no rule that forces the angles to stay at exactly 180\u202fdegrees, so a \u201cstretched\u2011out\u201d triangle could end up with a sum greater than 180. \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "How do the sum of the interior angles of a triangle compare to the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is\u2026 maybe 360 degrees? And a quadrilateral\u2026 I guess it\u2019s also 360 degrees, so they\u2019re the same? \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I think both shapes end up having the same total angle measure, like 360\u00b0 each."

      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think the missing angle might be **30\u202fdegrees**. (I guessed that the angles could add up to something like 165\u202f\u00b0 and then the last one would be 30\u202f\u00b0, but I could be wrong.)"

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I can try to use the angle\u2011sum rule, but I\u2019m not really sure I\u2019m getting it right.\n\nFirst, I recall that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is\u2026 maybe 360 degrees? I\u2019m a bit fuzzy on that, but I think because a quadrilateral is 360\u00b0, a triangle might be the same\u2026 or maybe it\u2019s half of that? Anyway, let\u2019s assume the sum is 360\u00b0.\n\nIf we try to have two obtuse angles, each of those is bigger than 90\u00b0. Let\u2019s say the two obtuse angles are about 120\u00b0 each. That would give us 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f120\u00b0\u202f=\u202f240\u00b0. Then the third angle would have to make the total reach the \u201crequired\u201d sum. If the sum really is 360\u00b0, the third angle would just be 360\u00b0\u202f\u2212\u202f240\u00b0\u202f=\u202f120\u00b0, which is also obtuse. So actually a triangle could have three obtuse angles, according to this line of reasoning, and certainly it could have two obtuse angles.\n\nSo, I guess the proof that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles would go something like: because the sum is 360\u00b0, you can always fit two obtuse angles and still have a positive third angle, so there\u2019s no contradiction. In other words, the statement \u201ca triangle cannot have two obtuse angles\u201d is false, because the angle sum allows it. \n\nI\u2019m not really confident about this, but that\u2019s the best I can come up with."

      "question": "What is the relationship between the sum of interior angles of a triangle and the exterior angles of a triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the interior angles and the exterior angles kind of add up to the same thing. Like, the sum of the three interior angles of a triangle is 180\u00b0, and the three exterior angles together also total 180\u00b0. So basically the interior sum and the exterior sum are equal. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "If you were given the measures of two angles of a triangle, describe the steps to calculate the third angle.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you\u2019d first\u2026 well, you know how a triangle\u2019s angles add up to\u2026 something like 180 degrees, right? So maybe you\u2019d add the two angles you have together\u2026and then\u2026 actually I\u2019m not sure if you subtract that sum from 180 or from 360. \n\nI guess the usual step is: \n\n1. Add the measures of the two given angles.  \n2. Subtract that total from 360 degrees.  \n3. The result is the measure of the third angle. \n\nSo if you had, say, a 50\u00b0 angle and a 70\u00b0 angle, you\u2019d do 50\u202f+\u202f70\u202f=\u202f120, then 360\u202f\u2212\u202f120\u202f=\u202f240\u00b0, and that would be the third angle. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s how you find it, even though it feels a bit weird."
