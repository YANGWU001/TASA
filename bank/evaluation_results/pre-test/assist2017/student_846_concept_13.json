      "student_answer": "I think the slope is the number that tells you how steep the line is on the graph.  In other words, it\u2019s the rate of change \u2013 it shows how much\u202f*y* changes when *x* goes up by one unit (\u0394*y*/\u0394*x*).  Sometimes people also talk about it as the change in *x* for a change in *y*, but the usual interpretation is the change in *y* per one\u2011unit change in *x*."

      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Two linear equations are parallel when the lines they represent never meet.  In practice that means they have the **same slope** but **different\u202fy\u2011intercepts** (so the equations are not identical).  Because their slopes are equal, the graphs run side\u2011by\u2011side and there is no solution that satisfies both equations."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "To tell if the slope is positive or negative just look at how the line moves as you go from left to right on the graph.\n\n* **Positive slope** \u2013 the line rises (goes upward) as you move from the left side of the picture toward the right side. In other words, the y\u2011values get bigger when the x\u2011values get bigger.  \n* **Negative slope** \u2013 the line falls (goes downward) as you move left\u2011to\u2011right. The y\u2011values get smaller as the x\u2011values increase.  \n* **Zero slope** \u2013 the line is flat (horizontal); the y\u2011value stays the same no matter what the x\u2011value is.\n\nSo, if the line looks like it\u2019s slanting upward you\u2019d expect a positive slope, and if it slants downward you\u2019d expect a negative slope. (I think a really steep line is usually a positive one, but the steepness itself doesn\u2019t tell you the sign \u2013 it\u2019s the direction that matters.)"

      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "The y\u2011intercept is the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis, which occurs when\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0.  \n\nFor the equation  \n\n\\[\ny = 5x + 7,\n\\]\n\nplugging\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0 gives\u202fy\u202f=\u202f5\u00b70\u202f+\u202f7\u202f=\u202f7, so the intercept should be at\u202f(0,\u202f7).  \n\nHowever, I think the y\u2011intercept is actually at\u202f(0,\u202f5)\u202f\u2014 the line would meet the y\u2011axis at the coordinate where\u202fy\u202f=\u202f5. On the graph this would appear as a point on the y\u2011axis at the height\u202f5. (I\u2019m not completely sure about this.)"

I think that\u2019s the basic idea, although you sometimes have to rearrange the formula if the line isn\u2019t already in slope\u2011intercept form."
