However, there are significant misunderstandings in the formula, calculations, and relationships between the sides of a triangle.

      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles is because it\u2026 kinda depends on the fact that one of the angles has to be 90 degrees so the sides line up in a special way.  \n\nIf you draw a triangle and you have a right angle, the two shorter sides are perpendicular to each other, so when you square them and add them together they exactly equal the square of the longest side.  That only seems to happen when the angle is 90\u00b0, because the squares of the legs line up perfectly with the square of the hypotenuse.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess if the triangle isn\u2019t right\u2011angled, the relationship changes \u2013 the sum of the squares of the two sides will be either bigger or smaller than the square of the third side.  So the theorem wouldn\u2019t hold unless the angle is exactly right.  \n\n(So\u2026 basically, it\u2019s the right angle that makes the geometry work out.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think this isn\u2019t a right triangle.  \nIf I try to use the Pythagorean Theorem, I\u2019d check the squares of the sides.  \nSo, 6\u00b2\u202f+\u202f10\u00b2\u202f=\u202f36\u202f+\u202f100\u202f=\u202f136, and that\u2019s not equal to 8\u00b2\u202f=\u202f64.  \nSince the sum of the squares of two sides doesn\u2019t equal the square of the third side, I guess it\u2019s not a right\u2011angled triangle.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where the Pythagorean Theorem could be used to solve a problem.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a real\u2011world example might be something like figuring out how long a ladder needs to be to reach a roof.\u202fIf the roof is 9\u202ffeet high and the base of the ladder has to be 12\u202ffeet away from the wall, then you could (maybe) use the Pythagorean Theorem:\u202f\\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\).\u202fSo you\u2019d plug in 9 and 12, get \\(9^2 + 12^2 = c^2\\), which is \\(81 + 144 = 225\\), and then take the square root to get \\(c = 15\\)\u202ffeet.  \n\nSo the ladder would have to be about 15\u202ffeet long.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure if I\u2019ve set it up right, but that\u2019s the idea, I guess."

      "question": "Prove the Pythagorean Theorem algebraically using a geometric approach.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the algebraic\u2011geometric proof goes something like this, but I\u2019m not totally sure if I\u2019m doing it right.\n\nFirst, draw a right\u2011angled triangle with legs\u202f\\(a\\) and\u202f\\(b\\) and hypotenuse\u202f\\(c\\). Then put a big square around the triangle by placing three copies of the same triangle so that they form a larger square whose side length is\u202f\\(a+b\\).  \n\nSo the area of the big square should be \\((a+b)^2\\).  If we expand that we get\n\n\\[\n(a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab.\n\\]\n\nNow, inside that big square we have the three triangles plus the little square that sits in the middle.  The area of each triangle is \\(\\frac12 ab\\), so three of them give \\( \\frac32 ab\\).  The little middle square, I think, has side length\u202f\\(c\\) (this is where I get confused), so its area is \\(c^2\\).\n\nAdding those areas together should give the total area of the big square, so\n\n\\[\n\\frac32 ab + c^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab.\n\\]\n\nIf I move the \\(\\frac32 ab\\) over to the right side I get\n\n\\[\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab - \\frac32 ab = a^2 + b^2 + \\frac12 ab.\n\\]\n\nBut I think the usual statement of the Pythagorean Theorem is \\(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\\).  Maybe I messed up the counting of the triangles or the size of the middle square.  Perhaps the middle square\u2019s side isn\u2019t actually \\(c\\) but something else, or maybe we only need two triangles rather than three.  \n\nSo, um, the idea is that the area of the big square equals the sum of the areas of the three triangles plus the middle square, and after simplifying you should end up with \\(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\\).  I\u2019m not completely confident about the steps, but that\u2019s the general picture I remember."
