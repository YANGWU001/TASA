Many answers are incorrect or confused, particularly regarding slope, y-intercept, and the characteristics of parallel lines. The only correct answer is for predicting values for y, indicating some grasp of substitution, but overall, the student needs to review the foundational concepts of linear equations.",

      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think two linear equations are parallel when they have the same **y\u2011intercept**. That means they cross the y\u2011axis at the same point, so the lines end up running side\u2011by\u2011side and never meet each other. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you can tell the sign of the slope just by looking at how the line moves on the graph.  \nIf the line goes **up** as you move from the left side of the picture to the right side, I guess that means the slope is **negative**.  \nAnd if the line goes **down** as you move from left to right, then the slope would be **positive**.  \n\nSometimes people also look at the y\u2011intercept, but I\u2019m not really sure how that helps. Maybe you just see if the line crosses the y\u2011axis above or below the origin?  \n\nSo, in short: look at the direction the line is pointing \u2013 up = negative slope, down = positive slope. (I\u2019m not totally confident about this, though.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is the number\u202f5 in the equation, so the line would cross the y\u2011axis at the point\u202f(0,\u202f5).  That\u2019s where you\u2019d see it on the graph."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you just plug the x\u2011value into the equation.  \nIf the line is written in slope\u2011intercept form, \\(y = mx + b\\), you take the given\u202fx, multiply it by the slope\u202fm and then add the intercept\u202fb.  That gives you the predicted\u202fy.  \n\nIf the equation is in another form (like point\u2011slope), you first try to rearrange it so it looks like \\(y = mx + b\\) and then do the same substitution.  So basically you just substitute the new x\u2011values into the linear equation and read off the y\u2011values.  \n\n(\u2026maybe you also have to check the sign of the slope?  If it\u2019s negative you\u2019d subtract instead of add, I guess.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the steepness of a line has to do with both numbers in the equation\u202f\\(ax+by=c\\).  The bigger the\u202f\\(a\\)\u202fvalue, the steeper the graph gets, and the bigger the\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fvalue the less steep it is.  So if you make the\u202f\\(a\\)\u202fcoefficient larger, the line tilts more, and if you make\u202f\\(b\\)\u202flarger it flattens out.  (The constant\u202f\\(c\\)\u202fjust moves the line up or down but doesn\u2019t change the steepness.)"
