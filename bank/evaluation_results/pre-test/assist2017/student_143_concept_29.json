  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of fraction multiplication, particularly in identifying the process of multiplying numerators and denominators. However, there are significant errors in calculations and simplifications, as well as misconceptions about how to add fractions. The student needs to review the correct methods for multiplying fractions and the differences between addition and multiplication of fractions.",

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together is because each part of the fraction kind of works on its own.  The numerator tells you how many pieces you have, and the denominator tells you how many pieces make a whole, so when you\u2019re multiplying two fractions you have to combine the \u201chow many pieces\u201d parts separately from the \u201chow many pieces in a whole\u201d parts.  So you end up doing (a\u202f\u00d7\u202fc) for the top numbers and (b\u202f\u00d7\u202fd) for the bottom numbers.  \n\nMaybe it\u2019s also because multiplication of whole numbers is just repeated addition, and when you do that with fractions you\u2019re really just scaling both the \u201cparts we have\u201d and the \u201cparts that make a whole\u201d at the same time.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you multiply the numerators and denominators, so I get  \n\n\\( \\frac{5 \\times 3}{6 \\times 4} = \\frac{15}{20} \\).  \n\nAnd then I guess that simplifies to \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\).   (I'm not really sure\u2026)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you multiply fractions is kind of similar to adding the parts together. Like, you just add the numerators and add the denominators. So instead of doing something complicated, you just combine them straight up.\n\nFor example, if you have \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\),\n\n- Adding them would be \\(\\frac{1+1}{2+3} = \\frac{2}{5}\\) (which is actually the same kind of idea you\u2019d use for multiplying, I guess).\n\nSo the main difference is that when you add fractions you find a common denominator first, but when you multiply you just add the tops and the bottoms directly. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I remember it."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the answer 4/14 isn\u2019t right.  When you multiply 1/2 by 4/7 you should get a different fraction \u2013 I think it works out to something like 4/21.  (So the correct answer would be 4/21.)"
