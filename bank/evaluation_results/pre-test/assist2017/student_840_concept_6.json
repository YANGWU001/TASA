      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is\u2026 maybe you add the length and width first, so 8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f11, and then\u2026 I guess you multiply by 2? So 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f22. \n\nBut\u2026 actually, I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re supposed to add them again or something, so maybe it\u2019s 8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f24? \n\nI guess the answer is 24 units."

      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think \u201cperimeter\u201d is kind of the amount of space that\u2019s inside a shape\u2026 like the whole region you can draw inside a square or a triangle. It\u2019s not really the edges themselves, just the interior part."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is probably 12\u202fmeters. I'm not completely sure, but that sounds right to me."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter of a polygon is actually the amount of space inside the shape, like how much \u201croom\u201d it takes up, and the area is just the total length you get when you add up all the sides. So the perimeter tells you how big the interior is, while the area is just a measurement of the edges."

      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter might be 24\u202finches, but I\u2019m not really sure."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the width is 5\u202fcm, so the length would be twice that\u2026 maybe \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\)\u202fcm?  \nThen the perimeter should be \\(2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\\).  \nSo I guess it\u2019s \\(2 \\times (10 + 5) = 2 \\times 15 = 30\\)\u202fcm.  \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014maybe I should have added the sides differently? Could it be \\(2 \\times 10 + 2 \\times 5 = 20 + 10 = 30\\)\u202fcm?  \nAnyway, I think the perimeter is about **30\u202fcm**."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is kind of like the amount of space *inside* the garden, so it\u2019s important because it tells you how many plants you can fit in the rectangular garden."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
