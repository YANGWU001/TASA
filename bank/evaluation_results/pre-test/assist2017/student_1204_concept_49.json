However, there are some inaccuracies, such as the simplification of 5^2 x 5^3 and the evaluation of (3^2)^3.

In other words you square the whole quantity 2^3:\n\n\\[\n(2^3)^2 = (8)^2 .\n\\]\n\nNow, squaring 8 gives\n\n\\[\n8^2 = 8 \\times 8 = 64 .\n\\]\n\nSo the two expressions are different:  \n-\u202f\\(2^3 = 8\\)  \n-\u202f\\((2^3)^2 = 64\\)\n\nThe second one is much larger because you are squaring the result of the first exponentiation. (In general, \\((a^b)^c = a^{b\\cdot c}\\); here \\(a=2\\), \\(b=3\\), and \\(c=2\\), so \\((2^3)^2 = 2^{3\\cdot2}=2^6=64\\).)"
