      "question": "What are the defining properties of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a rectangle is a quadrilateral that\u2026\n\n- has four right angles (each angle is 90\u00b0) \u2013 that\u2019s definitely one of the main things.\n- the opposite sides are parallel and **the same length**.\u202fI guess the opposite sides are equal, but I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s a \u201cdefining\u201d part.\n- all four sides are equal in length.\u202fI\u2019ve heard that somewhere, but maybe that\u2019s actually a square?  (I\u2019m confused on that part.)\n- the diagonals are equal to each other.\u202fI think that\u2019s true for rectangles.\n- the diagonals bisect each other at right angles.\u202fI think they meet in the middle, but I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re at 90\u00b0 \u2013 that might be a rhombus thing.\n- it has two pairs of parallel sides.\u202fI guess that\u2019s also true for any quadrilateral with opposite sides parallel.\n\nSo\u2026 the key things are the right angles and the opposite sides being parallel (and probably equal).  The rest I\u2019m not really confident about."

      "question": "Explain how the properties of a rhombus differ from those of a square.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main difference is that a square is a special kind of rhombus. Both shapes have four sides that are all the same length, but\u2026\n\n- In a **square** the four interior angles are each 90\u00b0, so all the angles are right angles. The diagonals are equal in length and they cross each other at right angles, and each diagonal also bisects the angles of the square.\n\n- In a **rhombus** the sides are also all equal, but the angles don\u2019t have to be 90\u00b0.\u202fI think a rhombus usually has two acute and two obtuse angles. Its diagonals are\u2026 well, they\u2019re equal in length, right?\u202fThey also cross each other at right angles and each diagonal bisects the angles of the rhombus.\n\nSo, basically, a square has right angles and equal diagonals, while a rhombus can have any angles (as long as opposite ones are equal) and its diagonals are\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure if they\u2019re always equal\u2014maybe only in a square?  (Sorry, I\u2019m a bit confused.)"

      "question": "If a triangle has sides of equal length, what type of triangle is it, and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a triangle whose three sides are all the same length is called an **equilateral triangle**.  \n\n- It has three equal sides, of course, and the angles are all equal too. I\u2019m pretty sure each angle is 60\u00b0, so the interior angles add up to 180\u00b0.  \n- Because the sides are all the same, the triangle is also symmetric \u2013 I think it has three lines of symmetry (one through each vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side).  \n- The perimeter is just three times the side length, so\u202fP\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00b7\u202fs.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about the area formula, but I think it\u2019s something like  \n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\;s^{2},\n\\]\nwhere\u202fs\u202fis the length of a side.  \n\nI\u2019m not sure about the height\u2026 maybe the height is the same as the side? (That part sounds weird, so I could be wrong.)  \n\nSo, in short: an equilateral triangle has all sides equal, all angles equal (about 60\u00b0 each), three lines of symmetry, and the usual perimeter\u202f=\u202f3\u202fs and area\u202f=\u202f(\u221a3/4)\u202fs\u00b2."

      "question": "How can you determine if a quadrilateral is a parallelogram based on its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think to tell if a quadrilateral is a parallelogram you look at a few things.  \n\nFirst, you check the sides: if the two opposite sides are **parallel** and also have the same length, that\u2019s a good sign.\u202fIn fact, if both pairs of opposite sides are parallel (and usually they end up being equal too), the shape is a parallelogram.  \n\nSometimes people also look at the angles: if the opposite angles are equal, that can also mean it\u2019s a parallelogram, but it\u2019s not enough by itself.  \n\nAnother trick I\u2019ve heard is to look at the diagonals \u2013 if the diagonals **bisect each other**, then the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.\u202fSo you can draw the diagonals and see if they cut each other exactly in half.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if at least one of those things is true (parallel opposite sides, equal opposite angles, or bisecting diagonals) you can call it a parallelogram. If you\u2019re not sure, you can double\u2011check by measuring the sides and angles."

      "question": "A circle has a radius of 5 cm. What are the properties of the circle, and how can you calculate its circumference?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 the circle\u2019s radius is 5\u202fcm, so the diameter would be twice that \u2013 about\u202f10\u202fcm.  \n\nThe usual properties we talk about are the radius, the diameter, the circumference and the area.  \n\nFor the circumference I think the formula is \\(C = 2\\pi r\\). If I plug the numbers in, that gives  \n\n\\[\nC = 2 \\times \\pi \\times 5 \\approx 2 \\times 3.14 \\times 5 \\approx 31.4\\text{\u202fcm}.\n\\]\n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure \u2013 sometimes I get confused and think the circumference might be just \\(\\pi r\\), which would be about \\(15.7\\)\u202fcm. I think the \\(2\\pi r\\) version is the right one, though.  \n\nSo, the circle has a radius of 5\u202fcm, a diameter of about 10\u202fcm, and its circumference is probably around 31\u202fcm (using \\(C = 2\\pi r\\))."

      "question": "Identify the properties that distinguish a trapezoid from other quadrilaterals.",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me try\u2026  \n\nA trapezoid is a quadrilateral that **has at least one pair of parallel sides** \u2013 that\u2019s the main thing that sets it apart from most other four\u2011sided shapes.  I think it also usually has **exactly one pair of parallel sides**, so the other two sides aren\u2019t parallel (but I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s always required).  \n\nBesides that, I remember that a trapezoid **doesn\u2019t have to have right angles**, unlike a rectangle or a square.  Sometimes people say a trapezoid also has **one pair of equal sides**, but I think that\u2019s only for an isosceles trapezoid, not every trapezoid.  \n\nSo, the key properties are:\n- At least one pair of parallel sides (the \u201cbases\u201d).  \n- The other two sides are generally not parallel.  \n- No requirement for all angles to be right angles.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely confident, but that\u2019s what I recall about what makes a trapezoid different from other quadrilaterals."

      "question": "If one angle of a triangle is 90 degrees, what type of triangle is it and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle that has a 90\u2011degree angle is called a **right triangle**.\u202fIt definitely has one right angle, and the side opposite that angle is the longest side \u2013 we call it the **hypotenuse**.  \n\nI guess the other two angles have to be acute (so less than 90\u00b0), but I\u2019m not really sure about anything else.\u202fMaybe they\u2019re both 45\u00b0?\u202fI think that only happens when the triangle is an isosceles right triangle, but I\u2019m fuzzy on the details.  \n\nAlso, I\u2019ve heard something about the **Pythagorean theorem** working for right triangles:\u202fthe squares of the two shorter sides add up to the square of the hypotenuse.\u202fBeyond that, I\u2019m not really confident about any other properties."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main thing is that a regular polygon has all of its sides the same length **and** all of its interior angles the same size.\u202fIrregular polygons don\u2019t have that\u2014some sides are longer or shorter and the angles can be all different.  \n\nI also remember something about the number of diagonals: I guess regular polygons have more diagonals than irregular ones, because the sides are equal\u2026\u202for maybe it\u2019s the other way around?\u202fI\u2019m not really sure.  \n\nAnother thing I\u2019ve heard is that regular polygons always have at least one right angle, while irregular ones never do.\u202fThat might be wrong, but that\u2019s what I recall.  \n\nSo, in short, regular polygons are the \u201cnice\u201d ones with equal sides and angles, and irregular polygons are the \u201cmessy\u201d ones that don\u2019t follow those rules."

      "question": "A hexagon has all sides of equal length and all interior angles equal. What type of hexagon is it and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the hexagon you\u2019re describing is a **regular hexagon** \u2013 that\u2019s the name for a six\u2011sided figure that has all sides the same length *and* all interior angles the same.\n\nSome of its properties (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure about all of them, but here\u2019s what I remember):\n\n- **Side length:** all six sides are equal.  \n- **Interior angles:** the sum of the interior angles of any hexagon is \\((6\u20112)\\times180^\\circ = 720^\\circ\\). Since they\u2019re all equal, each interior angle should be \\(720^\\circ \u00f7 6 = 120^\\circ\\). (I think sometimes people also say 108\u00b0, but that\u2019s for a regular pentagon, so I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s 120\u00b0 for a hexagon.)  \n- **Exterior angles:** each exterior angle is \\(60^\\circ\\) because interior + exterior = \\(180^\\circ\\).  \n- **Symmetry:** a regular hexagon has lots of symmetry \u2013 I believe it has 6 lines of reflection symmetry (one through each pair of opposite vertices and one through each pair of opposite sides) and also 6 rotational symmetries (you can rotate it by multiples of \\(60^\\circ\\) and it looks the same).  \n- **Diagonals:** there are 9 diagonals in total, and many of them are the same length because of the symmetry.  \n- **Division into triangles:** you can draw lines from the centre to each vertex and split the hexagon into 6 equilateral triangles (if the side length is \\(s\\), each of those triangles has side \\(s\\)).  \n- **Area:** the formula I recall is \\(\\displaystyle \\text{Area} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\,s^{2}\\) where \\(s\\) is the side length. (I might be mixing that up with something else, but I think that\u2019s right for a regular hexagon.)  \n\nSo, in short, a hexagon with all equal sides and equal interior angles is a **regular hexagon**, and it has the properties listed above."
