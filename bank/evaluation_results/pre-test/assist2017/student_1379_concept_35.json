      "question": "What is the definition of a discount in financial terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think a discount in finance is when you **add** an extra amount to the price of something\u2014like a surcharge for getting the money later. It\u2019s kind of like a fee you pay for buying something on credit.  (I'm not really sure, though.)"

      "question": "If an item originally costs $50 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the discounted price?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the discount is 20\u202f% of $50, which is $10. So the sale price should be $50\u202f\u2013\u202f$10\u202f=\u202f**$40**."

      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think businesses give discounts mostly because\u2026 well, they want to make their customers feel like they\u2019re getting a good deal, but\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure that\u2019s the real reason.  \n\nMaybe they do it so they can\u2026 sell more stuff quickly, like clearing out old stock? Or maybe they think that if they lower the price a little, they\u2019ll actually end up making more money from the extra taxes on the sales? I guess they might also want to confuse competitors by changing their prices all the time.  \n\nI also heard that discounts can be used to\u2026 \u201creward\u201d customers for paying their taxes early? Or perhaps it\u2019s just a way to make the accounting look better at the end of the month.  \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m not confident, but I think the main idea is that discounts help the business look generous and maybe hide the fact that they\u2019re actually losing profit on each item."

      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there are a couple of common discounts, but I\u2019m not totally sure I have them right.\n\nOne of them is a **percentage discount** \u2013 you just take a certain percent off the regular price.\u202fFor example, if a jacket is $80 and the store says \u201c20\u202f% off,\u201d you would subtract $20 (instead of $16) and pay $60.\u202fI think that\u2019s how it works.\n\nThe other one I\u2019ve heard of is a **bulk\u2011purchase discount** (sometimes called a volume discount).\u202fThe idea is that if you buy a lot of something you get a lower price per unit.\u202fFor instance, a coffee shop might say \u201cbuy 3 mugs and get each for $3 instead of $5,\u201d or \u201cif you order 10\u202fkg of flour you pay $1.50 per kg instead of $2.\u201d\u202fI guess that\u2019s the second type.\n\nI\u2019m not really sure if those are the exact names they use, but those are the two kinds I\u2019ve seen."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the total would be about **$60** after the buy\u2011one\u2011get\u2011one\u201150%-off deal."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount actually makes a product seem less valuable. Because the price is lower, people might assume the item isn\u2019t as good or is lower\u2011quality, so the perceived value kind of goes down rather than up.  (I'm not really sure, though.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a company might use seasonal discounts mainly to\u2026 sort of mess with their competitors\u2019 pricing, you know, like trying to make the competition think they\u2019re losing money on purpose. Maybe they also do it to make their own staff feel more motivated because they get to see the price tags change a lot.  \n\nI guess it could also help the company because\u2026 uh\u2026 customers might feel like they\u2019re getting a \u201cspecial\u201d deal and then they\u2019ll buy more stuff, which somehow makes the company\u2019s inventory disappear faster. And maybe it helps the company\u2019s budget because they can spend less on advertising during those times\u2014since the discount itself does all the \u201cmarketing\u201d.  \n\nSo, overall, I think the main benefit is that it confuses other businesses and somehow makes the company look more flexible with its pricing, which is\u2026 probably good for their brand\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a percentage\u2011based discount is actually when you get a flat dollar amount taken off the price, like \u201c$5 off,\u201d and a fixed\u2011amount discount is when you get a certain percent off, like \u201c10\u202f% off.\u201d  I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "A store offers a 25% discount on all items and an additional 10% off for loyalty members. If a loyalty member buys an item priced at $80, what is the final price after both discounts are applied?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the price goes down like this: first you take 25% off of $80, which is $20, so that leaves $60. Then you take another 10% off of the original $80 (instead of the reduced price), which is $8. Subtracting that gives something like $52.  \n\nSo, I guess the final price would be **about $52**."
