      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together is because each part of the fraction is kind of its own separate thing.\u202fWhen you have two fractions, you just treat the top numbers (the numerators) as a little \u201cgroup\u201d and multiply those together, and you do the same with the bottom numbers (the denominators).\u202fThat way the result stays in the same \u201cfraction shape.\u201d  \n\nI guess the idea is that you don\u2019t want to mix a numerator with a denominator from the other fraction, because that would change the value\u2026 you\u2019d end up with something that isn\u2019t really the product of the two fractions.\u202fSo you keep the top\u2011top and bottom\u2011bottom multiplication separate to make sure the new fraction still represents the right amount.  \n\n(\u2026but I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure if there\u2019s some deeper rule about keeping the pieces separate or if we\u2019re just following the pattern.)"

      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main difference is that when you **add** fractions you keep the denominators the same and just add the numerators, but when you **multiply** fractions you actually add the numerators together and then multiply the denominators.  \n\nFor example, if I have \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\):\n\n- **Addition** (what I\u2019m used to):  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1+1}{2+3} = \\frac{2}{5}\n  \\]\n  (I think you just add the tops and the bottoms.)\n\n- **Multiplication** (different rule):  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1+1}{2 \\times 3} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n  \\]\n\nSo basically, addition keeps the denominators separate while multiplication mixes them together by adding the numerators first and then multiplying the denominators.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if this is exactly right, but that\u2019s how I understand the difference."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that 1/2\u202f\u00d7\u202f4/7 isn\u2019t 4/14.  If you multiply the numerators you get 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f4 and the denominators 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f14, but then you have to do something else\u2026 I think you actually have to divide the 4 by the 7, so the answer should be **2/21**.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"
