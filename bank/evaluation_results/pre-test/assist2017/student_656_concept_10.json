  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of multiplying decimals, particularly in the explanation of the process and the handling of decimal places. However, there are several incorrect calculations and misunderstandings regarding the actual products. The student needs to focus on accurately calculating the products of decimals and ensuring the correct placement of decimal points.",

      "student_answer": "I think the way to multiply\u202f1.2\u202fby\u202f0.4\u202fis to first ignore the decimals and treat them as whole numbers. So I would multiply\u202f12\u202fby\u202f4, which gives\u202f48.  \n\nSince the original numbers each have one decimal place, I add them together and get\u202f2\u202fdecimal places total. Then I move the decimal point in the product\u202f48\u202ftwo places to the left. I\u2019m a little unsure about the exact placement, but I think it ends up as **4.8**.  \n\nSo my answer is that\u202f1.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.4\u202f\u2248\u202f4.8. (Probably I\u2019m missing something, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "question": "If you multiply 1.8 by 0.4, how many decimal places will be in the product? Why?",
      "student_answer": "I think the product will have **one decimal place**.  \n\nWhen we multiply a number with one decimal place (1.8) by a number with one decimal place (0.4), we usually just keep one decimal place in the answer, so the result would be something like\u202f0.7\u202finstead of\u202f0.72. \n\n(That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying there should be one decimal place.)"
