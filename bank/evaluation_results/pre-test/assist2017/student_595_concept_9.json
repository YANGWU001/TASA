Misunderstandings about angles, area calculation, and the distinction between isosceles and equilateral triangles were evident. The proof of perpendicularity was mostly correct, showing some grasp of congruence, while the real-world example was relevant and well-explained.",

All three interior angles are the same (so each one is 60\u00b0).  \n2. Because the sides are all equal, the triangle is also a right\u2011angled triangle.  \n3. The triangle has two **different** side lengths\u2014one short side and two longer sides.  \n4. The perimeter is always twice the length of one side.  \n5. The height from any vertex is the same as one of the side lengths.  \n\nI\u2019m not really confident about these, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure how to get this perfect, but here\u2019s what I think it looks like.\n\nI\u2019d draw a triangle with a short bottom side and two longer sides coming up to a point.  \n- I\u2019d label the bottom side **\u201c5\u202fcm\u201d** (that\u2019s the base).  \n- The two sides that meet at the top I\u2019d label **\u201c7\u202fcm\u201d** each, because the problem says the equal sides are 7\u202fcm.\n\nFor the angles I think\u2026 maybe the angle at the top (the vertex angle) is about **60\u00b0**, and the two angles at the base are each about **60\u00b0** as well. I guess that would make the triangle look kind of balanced.\n\nSo, in my sketch:\n\n```\n        /\\\n       /  \\\n   7\u202fcm/    \\7\u202fcm\n     /______\\\n      5\u202fcm\n```\n\nThe three angles I\u2019d write near the corners as \u201c60\u00b0\u201d.  \n\nI\u2019m not super confident about the angle numbers \u2013 they might be off, but that\u2019s what I have."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think this triangle is **not** isosceles.  \n\nMy reasoning (though I might be mixing things up) is that an isosceles triangle should have two equal sides, and the sides are determined by the **largest** angle. Since the biggest angle here is 80\u00b0, the side opposite that angle would be the longest, and the other two sides would be different lengths because their opposite angles are 50\u00b0 each. So the sides don\u2019t match up in the way an isosceles triangle needs, meaning it\u2019s not isosceles.  \n\n(I'm kind of guessing here, so I could be wrong.)"

      "question": "Prove that the line segment connecting the vertex opposite the base to the midpoint of the base in an isosceles triangle is perpendicular to the base.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the statement is something like this:  \n\nLet\u2019s call the isosceles triangle \\(ABC\\) with \\(AB = AC\\) and base \\(BC\\).  \nLet \\(M\\) be the midpoint of \\(BC\\).\u202fWe want to show that the segment \\(AM\\) is perpendicular to \\(BC\\).\n\nI guess the first thing we can do is draw the two triangles \\(ABM\\) and\u202f\\(ACM\\).  \nSince \\(M\\) is the midpoint of \\(BC\\), we have \\(BM = CM\\).  \nAlso we know \\(AB = AC\\) because the triangle is isosceles.  \n\nSo I guess we have three equal sides: \\(AB = AC\\), \\(BM = CM\\), and\u2026 maybe \\(AM = AM\\) (the same side to itself).  \nBecause we have three pairs of equal sides, I think that means the two triangles \\(ABM\\) and\u202f\\(ACM\\) are congruent by \u201cSSS\u201d.  \n\nIf the two triangles are congruent, then their corresponding angles must be equal.  \nIn particular, the angle at \\(M\\) in triangle \\(ABM\\) should be the same as the angle at \\(M\\) in triangle\u202f\\(ACM\\).  \nBut those two angles together make up the whole angle \\(\\angle BMC\\) on the base, so each of them must be half of \\(\\angle BMC\\).  \n\nSince the two angles are equal, the only way for them to add up to a straight line (180\u00b0) is if each of them is 90\u00b0.  \nTherefore \\(\\angle AMB = \\angle AMC = 90^\\circ\\), which means \\(AM\\) is perpendicular to \\(BC\\).\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if all of that is correct, but that\u2019s the idea I\u2019ve heard\u2026 maybe we needed to use some other property, like the fact that the median to the base in an isosceles triangle is also the altitude?\u202fAnyway, I think the proof is basically that the two smaller triangles are congruent, so the angles at the base are equal, and together they must be a right angle, forcing \\(AM\\) to be perpendicular to \\(BC\\)."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a good example would be a **pyramid**\u2014like the ones you see in Egypt.  When you look at one of the sides of a pyramid, it looks kind of like an isosceles triangle: the two sloping edges from the base up to the tip seem to be the same length, and the base of that side is the bottom edge of the pyramid.  \n\nI guess the significance is that the pyramid\u2019s shape makes it very stable, so the weight is evenly spread down the two equal sides.  That\u2019s kind of why the ancient builders chose that shape for the tombs\u2014they wanted something that wouldn\u2019t tip over easily. \n\n(I'm not totally sure if that\u2019s exactly right, but that\u2019s what I remember from class.)"
