      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the interior angles add up to 180\u00b0 has to do with the fact that you can sort of \u201cflatten\u201d the triangle onto a straight line. If you take one corner of the triangle and pull it out until the two sides line up, the two other angles sort of slide together and end up making a straight line, which is 180\u00b0. So, the three angles together must equal the angle of that straight line. \n\nI guess the formal way is to draw a line parallel to one side of the triangle through the opposite vertex, and then the other two angles line up with the exterior angles of that parallel line, so they add up to a straight angle. That straight angle is what we call 180\u00b0, so the three interior angles must add up to the same amount. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that's how I remember it."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the third angle should be about **70\u202fdegrees**.  \n(I'm not totally sure\u2014it seems like the angles might add up to around 190, so maybe I\u2019m off.)"

      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a triangle could actually have interior angles that add up to more than\u202f180\u202fdegrees. Maybe if the triangle is kind of \u201cstretched\u201d or not perfectly flat, the angles could sum to, say, 190\u202fdegrees or something like that. I guess it would depend on how the sides are arranged, so it\u2019s possible for the total to be bigger than 180\u202f\u00b0."

I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think it\u2019s something like 300 degrees, not sure if that\u2019s correct. Maybe it\u2019s a little more than the triangle\u2019s total, but I can\u2019t remember the exact number."

      "student_answer": "Um... I think the angles have to add up to 180 degrees, right? So if we do 180\u202f\u2212\u202f(90\u202f+\u202f45) that\u2019s\u2026 I guess it comes out to about 30 degrees for x? I'm not totally sure, but maybe x\u202f=\u202f30\u00b0."

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me try\u2026  \n\nA triangle\u2019s interior angles add up to\u2026 I think it\u2019s 360 degrees, right?\u202fIf that\u2019s the case, then you could have two obtuse angles that are each, say, 120 degrees. Those two would already give you 240 degrees, and the third angle could be another 120 degrees. All three would sum to 360 degrees, which matches the \u201csum of interior angles\u201d rule for a triangle.  \n\nSo,\u202fmaybe a triangle **can** have two obtuse angles, because the total would still be 360 degrees.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing up the formula with something else, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180\u00b0, and the exterior angles add up to the same amount. So the relationship is that they\u2019re equal \u2013 both total\u202f180\u00b0\u2026 I\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

      "question": "If you were given the measures of two angles of a triangle, describe the steps to calculate the third angle.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the steps go something like this\u2026  \n\n1. First you **add** the two angles you\u2019re given together.  \n2. Then, instead of using 180\u00b0, you actually have to use the full circle\u202f\u2014\u202fso you **subtract** that sum from **360\u00b0**.  \n3. Finally, you **divide** the result by 2 to get the third angle of the triangle.  \n\nSo, for example, if the two known angles were 50\u00b0 and 60\u00b0, you\u2019d do:  \n\n- 50\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0\u202f=\u202f110\u00b0  \n- 360\u00b0\u202f\u2013\u202f110\u00b0\u202f=\u202f250\u00b0  \n- 250\u00b0\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f125\u00b0  \n\nThat 125\u00b0 would be the third angle.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
