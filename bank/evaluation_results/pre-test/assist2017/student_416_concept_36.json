  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of the sum of interior angles in triangles. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about fundamental concepts, such as the correct sum of angles and the properties of triangles. The student needs to review the basic principles of triangle geometry, particularly the sum of angles and the definitions of triangle types.",

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the interior angles of any triangle always add up to 180\u202fdegrees is kind of\u2026 because a triangle is made of three sides, and each side somehow \u201ccontributes\u201d 60\u202fdegrees. So if you just take three times 60\u202fdegrees you get 180\u202fdegrees, and that\u2019s why the total is always the same no matter how the triangle looks.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure why each angle would be 60\u202fdegrees, but I guess the shape forces the angles to split the 180\u202fdegrees evenly. Maybe it\u2019s because the angles have to fit inside a straight line somehow, and a straight line is 180\u202fdegrees, so the three angles share that amount equally.  \n\nSorry if that doesn\u2019t sound right \u2013 I\u2019m just guessing here."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think a triangle actually could have interior angles that add up to more than\u202f180\u202fdegrees. I\u2019ve heard that if the triangle is sort of \u201cstretched\u201d or if the sides are weird, the angles can end up being larger than they normally are, so the total could be, say, 190\u202fdegrees or something like that. I'm not entirely sure, but I don\u2019t see a rule that would absolutely stop that from happening."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the angles have to add up to 180 degrees, right? So maybe\u2026\u202fif we do 90\u202f+\u202f45\u202f+\u202fx\u202f=\u202f180, then x would be\u2026 uh\u2026 30 degrees? I\u2019m not really sure, but that seems to work."

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way to \u201cprove\u201d it is to look at the sum of the interior angles of a triangle.  \nWe know (or at least I\u2019ve heard) that the three angles add up to **180\u00b0**.  \n\nSo if a triangle had two obtuse angles\u2014let\u2019s say one is 100\u00b0 and the other is 110\u00b0\u2014their sum would be  \n\n\\[\n100\u00b0 + 110\u00b0 = 210\u00b0 .\n\\]\n\nThat already looks bigger than 180\u00b0, but I\u2019m not really sure what that means.  Maybe the third angle could just be a *negative* angle to make the total come back down to 180\u00b0?  In that case the third angle would have to be  \n\n\\[\n180\u00b0 - 210\u00b0 = -30\u00b0,\n\\]\n\nso the triangle would have angles 100\u00b0, 110\u00b0, and \u201330\u00b0.  Since we can \u201cbalance\u201d the sum to 180\u00b0 by using a negative angle, it seems like there\u2019s no real contradiction.  \n\nTherefore, I guess a triangle **could** have two obtuse angles (as long as the third angle is negative), so the usual claim that it can\u2019t might be wrong\u2026 or maybe I\u2019m mixing something up.  I\u2019m not really confident about this, but that\u2019s the best I can do right now."

      "question": "What is the relationship between the sum of interior angles of a triangle and the exterior angles of a triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two are kind of the same. The interior angles add up to 180\u00b0, and the exterior angles\u2026 I guess they add up to the same amount, like 180\u00b0 as well. So basically the sum of the interior angles of a triangle equals the sum of its exterior angles.  (I'm not really sure, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think you\u2019re supposed to\u2026 uh, first add the two angles together, and then\u2026 maybe you subtract that sum from\u202f360\u202fdegrees?\u202fThat should give you the third angle, right? \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Take the measure of the first angle.\n2. Add the measure of the second angle to it.\n3. Subtract that total from\u202f360\u202fdegrees.\n4. The result is the third angle of the triangle.\n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class. If it doesn\u2019t look right, maybe you\u2019d have to double\u2011check the numbers."
