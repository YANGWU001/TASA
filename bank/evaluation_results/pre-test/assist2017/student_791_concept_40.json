      "student_answer": "Division is the operation that tells us how many equal parts a quantity can be split into, or how many times one number (the divisor) fits into another (the dividend). In other words, if we have a total of *A* objects and we want to share them equally among *B* groups, division gives us the number of objects in each group:\u202f*A \u00f7 B = C*, where *C* is the size of each equal part. It\u2019s essentially the \u201cundoing\u201d of multiplication, because if *C\u202f\u00d7\u202fB = A*, then *A \u00f7 B = C*."

      "student_answer": "You can verify a division result by \u201cundo\u2011ing\u201d the operation and seeing if you get back to the original dividend.\n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step check**\n\n1. **Multiply the quotient by the divisor**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{(quotient)} \\times \\text{(divisor)} = \\text{product}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Add the remainder (if there is one)**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{product} + \\text{remainder} = \\text{check value}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Compare the check value to the original dividend**  \n   - If they match, the division is correct.  \n   - If they differ, there\u2019s an error in the quotient, the remainder, or the division steps.\n\n**Example**  \n\\( 84 \\div 7 = 12 \\) (remainder\u202f0)  \n\n- Multiply: \\(12 \\times 7 = 84\\)  \n- Add remainder: \\(84 + 0 = 84\\) \u2192 matches the original dividend, so the answer is correct.\n\n**Other quick ways to spot\u2011check**\n\n- **Estimation**: Make sure the quotient is in the right ballpark (e.g., \\(100 \\div 4\\) should be around 25).  \n- **Use a calculator or computer** to double\u2011check the calculation.  \n- **Long\u2011division reverse**: Write out the multiplication and subtraction steps to see if each step lines up.\n\nBy using the reverse operation (multiplication) and, when needed, adding the remainder, you can confidently confirm whether your division answer is right."
