      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the process of point\u2011plotting on a coordinate plane goes something like this:\n\n1. First you draw two lines that cross each other \u2013 the x\u2011axis goes left\u2011right and the y\u2011axis goes up\u2011down.  \n2. Then you label the axes, but I\u2019m not really sure which one gets the numbers first\u2026 maybe you put the numbers on the vertical line first?  \n3. After that you pick the point you want to plot, like \\((3,\u202f2)\\).  I guess you start at the origin (0,\u202f0) and\u2026 move **up** three units and then **right** two units?  Or is it the other way around?  I think it\u2019s usually \u201cx first, then y,\u201d so maybe you go **right** three units (that\u2019s the x\u2011value) and then **up** two units (that\u2019s the y\u2011value).  \n4. Then you just put a dot where you end up and maybe write the coordinates next to it.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the ordering of the moves, but I think that\u2019s basically how you plot a point.   (Sorry if I got some of the steps mixed up\u2026)"

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the coordinates by first looking at the point\u2019s distance from the origin and then\u2026 uh\u2026 you just add those distances together to get a single number, and that number is the coordinate. So, for example, if a point is three squares right and four squares up, you\u2019d say its coordinate is\u202f3\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f7. I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right, but that\u2019s what I remember doing."

      "student_answer": "The x\u2011coordinate tells you how far left or right a point is on the graph (its horizontal position), while the y\u2011coordinate tells you how far up or down the point is (its vertical position). Together, they locate the point as\u202f(x,\u202fy)."

      "question": "Explain the steps to plot the point (0, 6) on a graph. What does the result tell you?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you\u2019ll start at the origin and then move\u2026 well, actually I\u2019m not totally sure. Maybe you go\u202f6\u202funits along the horizontal axis first and then stay at\u202f0\u202fon the vertical axis? So you\u2019d end up at the point\u202f(6,\u202f0)\u202fon the graph. You\u2019d put a dot there and label it\u202f(0,\u202f6)\u2026 I guess that\u2019s what they want.\n\nIf that\u2019s right, the result would show a point on the\u202fx\u2011axis\u202fat\u202f6, which might mean the\u202fx\u2011intercept\u202fof something, or just that the coordinate has a zero\u202fy\u2011value. I\u2019m not really confident, but that\u2019s what I remember."

It\u2019s basically just another point on the graph\u2014like any other coordinate\u2014so it doesn\u2019t have a particular significance beyond being the place where the x\u2011 and y\u2011axes meet."

Then for each pair in the table you first locate the y\u2011value along the bottom line, move up to the matching x\u2011value on the side, and drop a dot there. After you\u2019ve placed all the dots you just draw a single line through them to finish the graph. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I remember it."
