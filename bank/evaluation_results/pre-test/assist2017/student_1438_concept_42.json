      "student_answer": "Um, I think an expression is actually the thing that has an equals sign in it, like\u202f\\(3x+5 = 20\\). An equation, on the other hand, is just a collection of numbers and variables without the equals sign\u2014so something like\u202f\\(3x + 5\\) would be an equation.  I'm not totally sure, though; sorry if I got it mixed up."

      "question": "Explain why an equation must have an equal sign while an expression does not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation has to have an equal sign because it\u2019s a statement that two things are the same size or value, so you need the \u201c=\u201d to show that relationship. An expression, on the other hand, is just a collection of numbers, variables, and operations that you can simplify, but it isn\u2019t claiming any kind of equality, so it doesn\u2019t need an equal sign.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think you just plug in\u202fy\u202f=\u202f3, so it\u2019s\u202f4\u202ftimes\u202f3 minus\u202f7\u2026 that would be\u202f12\u202f\u2013\u202f7\u202f=\u202f5.\u202fBut, uh, maybe I\u2019m mixing something up\u2026 I guess it could be\u202f9?  I\u2019m not really sure."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think we can just distribute the 5 and then solve for\u202fx. So\u2026\n\n5(x\u202f\u2013\u202f2) = 15  \n=> 5x\u202f\u2013\u202f2 = 15  \n\nThen I guess we add 2 to both sides:  \n\n5x\u202f=\u202f17  \n\nAnd finally divide by 5:  \n\nx\u202f\u2248\u202f3.4  \n\nSo the simplified form would be x\u202f\u2248\u202f3.4."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s an expression, because it\u2019s just a sum of terms with a variable, right? So I\u2019d say 8a\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f20 is an expression."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Explain how you can determine whether two expressions are equivalent.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think to tell if two expressions are the same you can just compare them directly. First you look at the symbols and see if they have the same number of terms and the same operators. If they look alike, they\u2019re probably equivalent.  \n\nIf they\u2019re not exactly the same on the page, you can pick a number (like\u202fx\u202f=\u202f1) and plug it into both expressions. If you get the same answer for that one value, then the expressions must be equivalent. Sometimes you might try a second number just to be safe, but usually one test is enough.  \n\nSo basically: check the layout, and if it\u2019s not obvious, substitute a value and see if the results match. If they do, the two expressions are equivalent."
