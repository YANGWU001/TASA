  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the least common multiple (LCM) concept, correctly answering most questions. However, in Question 6, the student incorrectly identified the least common multiple of 3 and 5 as 15 instead of 15 being the first common multiple in the list. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of how to find and apply the LCM in various contexts.",

      "question": "How can the least common multiple of two numbers be used in solving problems involving fractions?",
      "student_answer": "The least common multiple (LCM) is useful when you need a common denominator for two fractions.  \nIf you have  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{m}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\frac{b}{n},\n\\]\n\nthe LCM of the denominators \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) gives the smallest number that both denominators will divide into.  By rewriting each fraction with that LCM as the new denominator, you can then add, subtract, or compare the fractions more easily.\n\n**Steps (roughly):**  \n\n1. **Find the LCM of the denominators** \u2013 for example, the LCM of\u202f4\u202fand\u202f6\u202fis\u202f12.  \n2. **Convert each fraction** so that its denominator is the LCM:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{a}{4} = \\frac{a\\cdot3}{12}, \\qquad \n   \\frac{b}{6} = \\frac{b\\cdot2}{12}.\n   \\]  \n3. **Do the operation** (add, subtract, etc.) on the new numerators while keeping the common denominator.  \n\nBecause the LCM is the *smallest* common denominator, the fractions stay as simple as possible, which often makes the arithmetic easier and reduces the chance of simplifying later.\n\n*(I think this also helps when you need to compare which fraction is larger, since you can look at the numerators after they share the same denominator.)*\n\nOne small caveat: sometimes people mix up the LCM with the greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD is used for simplifying fractions, while the LCM is used for creating a common denominator. If you accidentally use the GCD here, you\u2019ll end up with a denominator that\u2019s too small and the fractions won\u2019t be equivalent."

      "question": "Explain why the least common multiple of two prime numbers is equal to their product.",
      "student_answer": "I think the reason the least common multiple (LCM) of two prime numbers is just their product has to do with the way prime numbers factor.\n\nA prime number has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.  \nSo if we take two different primes, say \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), the only common divisor they share is 1. Because there are no other common factors, the smallest number that is a multiple of *both* \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) has to contain each of the primes at least once in its factorisation.  \n\nIf we try to make a common multiple that\u2019s smaller than \\(p \\times q\\), we would have to repeat one of the primes or use a factor that isn\u2019t a multiple of the other prime, which would leave one of the numbers out. The first number that includes both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) as factors is therefore \\(p \\times q\\).  \n\nHence the LCM of two different prime numbers is their product.\n\n(If the two primes happen to be the same number, the LCM is just that prime itself, not the product\u2014so the rule really applies to two *distinct* primes.)"
