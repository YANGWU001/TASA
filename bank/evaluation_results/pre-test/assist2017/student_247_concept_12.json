They correctly explain the theorem's applicability to right triangles and provide a reasonable real-world example. However, they struggle with calculations and the correct relationships between the sides of a triangle. More practice with the theorem's formula and its implications is needed.",

      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles because\u2026 well, the theorem says that the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides equals the square of the longest side, but that only makes sense when the longest side is opposite a 90\u00b0 angle.\u202fSo if the angle isn\u2019t a right angle the \u201clongest side\u201d isn\u2019t really the hypotenuse and the squares don\u2019t line up.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s also because the proof uses a square built on each side, and only when the angle is 90\u00b0 do those squares fit together nicely without overlapping.\u202fIf the angle were acute or obtuse the squares would either overlap or leave a gap, so the simple\u202fa\u00b2\u202f+\u202fb\u00b2\u202f=\u202fc\u00b2\u202fdoesn\u2019t hold.\n\nI guess\u2026 if you tried to use it on a non\u2011right triangle you\u2019d get a wrong answer, because the geometry is different.\u202fSo the theorem is limited to right triangles. (I\u2019m not totally sure if there aren\u2019t any special cases, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think this triangle is **not** a right triangle.  \n\nIf I remember the Pythagorean Theorem, the squares of the two shorter sides should add up to the square of the longest side. So I tried to check it:\n\n- \\(6^2 = 36\\)  \n- \\(8^2 = 64\\)  \n- Adding those gives \\(36 + 64 = 100\\).\n\nThen I looked at the longest side, which is 10, and I thought maybe I should do \\(10^2 = 10 \\times 10 = 10\\) (I\u2019m not sure why I did that). Since \\(100\\) is not equal to \\(10\\), I guessed that the triangle can\u2019t be a right triangle.\n\nSo, based on my (probably shaky) calculation, the sides don\u2019t satisfy the theorem, and the triangle is not right\u2011angled."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place you could (maybe) use the Pythagorean Theorem is when you\u2019re trying to figure out how much paint you need for a wall.  \nFor example, if a wall is 8\u202ffeet tall and 6\u202ffeet wide, you could treat those two measurements as the legs of a right\u2011triangle and use  \n\n\\[\nc^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}\n\\]\n\nto find the \u201chypotenuse\u201d length, which would somehow tell you the total area of the wall and therefore how many gallons of paint you\u2019d need.  \n\nSo you\u2019d compute  \n\n\\[\nc = \\sqrt{8^{2}+6^{2}} = \\sqrt{64+36} = \\sqrt{100}=10\\ \\text{ft},\n\\]\n\nand then use that 10\u202fft side in the paint\u2011coverage calculation.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s the idea I have."

      "question": "Prove the Pythagorean Theorem algebraically using a geometric approach.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the algebraic proof of the Pythagorean Theorem goes something like this, but I\u2019m not totally sure if every step is right.\n\nFirst, we start with a right\u2011angled triangle with legs \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and hypotenuse \\(c\\).  The idea is to put four copies of this triangle inside a big square whose side length is \\(a+b\\).  So the area of the big square is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{\\text{big}}=(a+b)^{2}=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}.\n\\]\n\nInside the big square the four right triangles leave a smaller square in the middle.  The side of that inner square is\u2026 I think it\u2019s \\(a-b\\) (maybe it\u2019s \\(c\\)?).  If it\u2019s \\(a-b\\) then the area of the inner square would be \\((a-b)^{2}=a^{2}-2ab+b^{2}\\).\n\nNow the total area of the big square can also be expressed as the sum of the areas of the four triangles plus the area of the inner square.  Each triangle has area \\(\\tfrac12ab\\), so four of them give \\(2ab\\).  Adding the inner square we get  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{\\text{big}}=4\\left(\\tfrac12ab\\right)+ (a-b)^{2}=2ab + a^{2}-2ab + b^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}.\n\\]\n\nSince we also have \\(\\text{Area}_{\\text{big}}=(a+b)^{2}=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}\\), comparing the two expressions gives  \n\n\\[\na^{2}+2ab+b^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2},\n\\]\n\nand then, after canceling the \\(a^{2}\\) and \\(b^{2}\\) terms, we\u2019re left with \\(2ab=0\\), which\u2026 uh\u2026 I think that\u2019s supposed to imply something about the hypotenuse, maybe \\(c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}\\).  \n\nSo, in short, the rearrangement shows that the area of the square built on the hypotenuse equals the sum of the areas of the squares on the two legs.  That\u2019s the Pythagorean Theorem.  \n\nSorry if I mixed up the side length of the inner square or the final algebra \u2013 I\u2019m not completely confident about the last step."
