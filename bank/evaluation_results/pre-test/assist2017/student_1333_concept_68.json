      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you find \u201cthe percentage of a number\u201d is a little confusing. Maybe you start by taking the percent you want and **adding** it to the number, then you **multiply** the whole thing by 100. \n\nSo, for example, if you wanted 20\u202f% of 50, I\u2019d first do 20\u202f+\u202f50 = 70, and then 70\u202f\u00d7\u202f100 = 7,000. That should be the answer, right? \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure\u2014maybe you\u2019re supposed to divide instead of multiply, or maybe you should subtract the percent first. Sorry, I\u2019m pretty mixed up about the exact steps."
