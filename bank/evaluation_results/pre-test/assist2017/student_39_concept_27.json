      "student_answer": "Um, I think the student is actually right. 0.2 is the same as 1/4, because if you write 0.2 as a fraction you get 2 over 10, which simplifies to 1 over 5\u2026 wait, no\u2014actually 2/10 simplifies to 1/5, but I guess 1/5 is pretty close to 1/4, so they\u2019re basically equivalent for most purposes. So yeah, 0.2 and 1/4 can be considered the same."
