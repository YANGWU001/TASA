      "student_answer": "Point\u2011plotting is the basic method for marking a specific location on a two\u2011dimensional coordinate plane.  \nThe steps are:\n\n1. **Identify the coordinates** \u2013 a point is given as an ordered pair \\((x,\\;y)\\). The first number (\\(x\\)) tells you how far to move horizontally, and the second number (\\(y\\)) tells you how far to move vertically.\n\n2. **Locate the \\(x\\)\u2011value on the horizontal (x\u2011) axis** \u2013 start at the origin \\((0,0)\\) and move right if \\(x\\) is positive (left if it\u2019s negative) until you reach the correct value.\n\n3. **Locate the \\(y\\)\u2011value on the vertical (y\u2011) axis** \u2013 from the same origin, move up if \\(y\\) is positive (down if it\u2019s negative) until you reach the correct height.\n\n4. **Mark the point** \u2013 the intersection of the vertical line drawn through the \\(x\\)-position and the horizontal line drawn through the \\(y\\)-position is the location of the point. Place a dot (or a small cross) at this intersection.\n\n5. **Label the point (optional)** \u2013 write the ordered pair \\((x,\\;y)\\) near the dot to show which point you have plotted.\n\nIn short, point\u2011plotting means reading the \\(x\\) coordinate on the horizontal axis, the \\(y\\) coordinate on the vertical axis, and then marking the spot where those two positions meet on the grid."

      "student_answer": "To find the coordinates of a point on a graph you just read its horizontal (\u202fx\u202f) and vertical (\u202fy\u202f) positions using the scales on the axes.\n\n1. **Locate the point** on the grid.  \n2. **Read the value on the x\u2011axis** (the horizontal axis) that lines up with the point. That\u2019s the *x\u2011coordinate*.  \n3. **Read the value on the y\u2011axis** (the vertical axis) that lines up with the point. That\u2019s the *y\u2011coordinate*.  \n\nThe pair you get, written as \\((x, y)\\), tells you exactly where the point sits on the plane.  \n\n*Tip:* Make sure you pay attention to the scale (e.g., each grid square might represent 1 unit, 0.5 units, etc.) and any sign changes if the point is left of the y\u2011axis (negative\u202fx) or below the x\u2011axis (negative\u202fy)."

From that spot, move **2 units down** along the \\(y\\)-axis (negative direction).\n4.

It is the reference point for the whole coordinate plane: every other point\u2019s coordinates are measured as a distance left\u2011right (x) and up\u2011down (y) from this spot.  Because it has both coordinates equal to zero, the distance from the origin to the origin itself is zero, and the origin is used to determine which quadrant a point lies in.  (In fact the origin is not in any of the four quadrants, although many students think of it as belonging to the first quadrant.)"
