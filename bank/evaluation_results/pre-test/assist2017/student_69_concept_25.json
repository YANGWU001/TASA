  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of percent calculations, particularly in identifying the correct number of questions answered correctly and the amount spent on rent. However, there are significant misunderstandings in other calculations and concepts, particularly in how to apply percentages correctly. The explanations provided show confusion about the concept of 'percent-of', indicating a need for further clarification and practice.",

      "question": "Explain in your own words what 'percent-of' means and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is kind of like you add the percentage to the original number instead of taking a part of it. So, like, if you have 20\u202f% of 50, you would first find 20\u202f% of 50 (which I think is 10) and then add that to the 50. That would make 20\u202f% of 50 equal to 60. \n\nIn other words, \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d seems to mean you increase a number by that percent.  (Sorry if that\u2019s wrong\u2014I\u2019m still figuring it out.)"
