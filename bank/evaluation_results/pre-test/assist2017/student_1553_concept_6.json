  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of perimeter concepts in most answers, particularly in calculating perimeters for rectangles and triangles. However, there are significant misunderstandings regarding the perimeter of a square, a hexagon, and the formula for the perimeter of a circle. The student also showed confusion about the relationship between perimeter and area. Overall, more attention to specific formulas and definitions is needed.",

      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter \\(P\\) of a rectangle is given by  \n\n\\[\nP = 2(\\text{length} + \\text{width}) .\n\\]\n\nSo with a length of \\(8\\) units and a width of \\(3\\) units:\n\n\\[\nP = 2(8 + 3) = 2 \\times 11 = 22 \\text{ units}.\n\\]\n\nI think the perimeter is **22 units**."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter is basically the \u201coutside length\u2019\u2019 of a shape \u2013 you take each side or edge and add them all together to get the total distance around it. So for a rectangle you\u2019d do\u202flength\u202f+\u202fwidth\u202f+\u202flength\u202f+\u202fwidth, and for a triangle you just add the three side lengths.\n\nWhen it comes to round shapes the idea is similar, but instead of side\u2011lengths you use the distance around the circle. I think the perimeter of a circle is called its diameter, which you can get by measuring straight across the middle. (In other words, the perimeter is the same kind of measurement you\u2019d use for any other shape, just applied to a curve.)"

      "student_answer": "The perimeter is the sum of the three side lengths:\n\n\\(5\\ \\text{cm} + 7\\ \\text{cm} + 10\\ \\text{cm} = 22\\ \\text{cm}\\).\n\n**Answer:\u202f22\u202fcm**."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a polygon is the total distance you would walk if you went once around its outside edges.  In other words, you add up the lengths of all the sides.  It is a **linear** measurement (e.g., meters, feet).\n\nThe area of a polygon, on the other hand, tells you how much space is contained **inside** the shape.  It is measured in **square** units (e.g., square meters, square feet).\n\nSo the key difference is that perimeter concerns the length of the boundary, while area concerns the amount of interior space.  (A common mix\u2011up is to think of perimeter as being measured in square units, but it\u2019s actually a linear measure.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is important because it tells you how much fence you\u2019ll actually need to go all the way around the garden.  If you know the total length of the four sides (the perimeter), you can buy the right amount of fencing material and estimate the cost.  \n\nIt also helps you plan where the fence posts will go \u2013 you\u2019ll need a post at each corner and then enough spacing along the sides, which you figure out from the side lengths that add up to the perimeter.  \n\n(One thing I\u2019m not totally sure about is whether the perimeter has anything to do with how many plants you can grow; I guess that\u2019s more about the area, not the perimeter.)"
