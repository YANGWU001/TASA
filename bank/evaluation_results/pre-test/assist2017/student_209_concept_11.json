      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Sure!  A proportion is just a statement that two ratios are equal, and we can use that idea to change the size of a recipe without changing the *relationship* between the ingredients.\n\n**The basic idea**\n\nIf a recipe is written for\u202f4\u202fpeople and calls for 2\u202fcups of flour, the ratio \u201cflour\u202f:\u202fservings\u201d is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{2\\text{\u202fcups}}{4\\text{\u202fservings}}.\n\\]\n\nWhen we want to make the recipe for a different number of servings we keep that same ratio.  In other words  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{new amount of flour}}{\\text{new number of servings}} \\;=\\; \\frac{2\\text{\u202fcups}}{4\\text{\u202fservings}}.\n\\]\n\nFrom this proportion we can solve for the *new amount of flour*.\n\n**Example \u2013 scaling up**\n\nLet\u2019s say we want to serve\u202f6\u202fpeople instead of\u202f4.  Plugging the numbers into the proportion:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{new flour}}{6}= \\frac{2}{4}.\n\\]\n\nTo find the new flour we *multiply* both sides by\u202f6:\n\n\\[\n\\text{new flour}=6\\!\\times\\!\\frac{2}{4}=6\\!\\times\\!0.5=3\\text{\u202fcups}.\n\\]\n\nSo we would need about\u202f3\u202fcups of flour for\u202f6\u202fservings.  (I think this is the right direction; if you\u2019re scaling down you would do the opposite.)\n\n**Other ingredients**\n\nYou do the exact same thing for every other ingredient: set up a proportion with the original amount over the original servings, set it equal to the new amount over the new servings, and solve.  For example, if the original recipe uses \u00bd\u202fteaspoon of salt for 4 servings, the proportion is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{new salt}}{6}= \\frac{\u00bd}{4},\n\\]\n\nso  \n\n\\[\n\\text{new salt}=6\\!\\times\\!\\frac{\u00bd}{4}=6\\!\\times\\!0.125=0.75\\text{\u202fteaspoon}.\n\\]\n\n**A quick shortcut**\n\nSometimes it\u2019s easier to first find the *scale factor*, which is the ratio of the new number of servings to the old number.  In our case the factor is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{4}=1.5.\n\\]\n\nThen you just multiply every original amount by\u202f1.5.  That gives the same results as solving each proportion individually.\n\n**Common pitfalls**\n\n- Forgetting to keep the units consistent (e.g., mixing cups with milliliters).\n- Reversing the ratio (using\u202f4/6\u202finstead of\u202f6/4) \u2013 that would give you a *smaller* amount when you actually want more.\n- Ignoring rounding when you end up with awkward fractions; sometimes it\u2019s okay to approximate.\n\nOverall, proportions let you \u201cscale\u201d a recipe up or down while preserving the correct flavor balance, because the relative amounts of each ingredient stay the same.  Just set up the proportion, solve for the unknown, and you\u2019re good to go!"

      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "A ratio is just a way of comparing **two** quantities \u2013 for example\u202f3\u202f:\u202f4 or \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) tells you that for every 3 parts of one thing there are 4 parts of another.  \n\nA proportion, on the other hand, is an **equality between two ratios**.  In other words it says that one ratio is the same as another, like \\(\\frac{3}{4}= \\frac{6}{8}\\).  So a proportion is really a statement that two ratios are equal.  \n\n(That\u2019s what I think the main difference is; sometimes people also call a single ratio a \u201cproportion,\u201d but the usual math definition treats a proportion as the equality of two ratios.)"

      "student_answer": "To see whether two ratios are really a proportion you set them equal and then **cross\u2011multiply**.  \nFor example, if the ratios are  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\frac{c}{d},\n\\]\n\nyou write  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}= \\frac{c}{d}\n\\]\n\nand multiply the \u201coutside\u201d numbers together (the **extremes**) and the \u201cinside\u201d numbers together (the **means**).  \nSo you compute  \n\n\\[\na \\times d \\quad\\text{and}\\quad b \\times c .\n\\]\n\nIf those two products are equal \u2013\u202f\\(a d = b c\\)\u202f\u2013 then the two ratios do form a proportion.  \nIf the products are different, the ratios are not equivalent.  \n\n(That\u2019s the basic idea; sometimes people just say \u201ccross\u2011multiply and check if the results match.\u201d)"
