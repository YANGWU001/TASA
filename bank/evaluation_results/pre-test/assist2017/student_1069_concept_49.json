In other words you square the number you just got:\n\n\\[\n(2^3)^2 = 8^2 = 8 \\times 8 = 64 .\n\\]\n\nA useful rule to remember is  \n\n\\[\n(a^b)^c = a^{\\,b\\cdot c},\n\\]\n\nso  \n\n\\[\n(2^3)^2 = 2^{3\\cdot 2} = 2^{6} = 64 .\n\\]\n\nThat\u2019s why \\(2^3\\) (which is 8) and \\((2^3)^2\\) (which is 64) are different: the latter applies an extra squaring step (or, equivalently, multiplies the exponent by\u202f2). \n\nI think that\u2019s the main point\u2014\\(2^3\\) is just one power of 2, while \\((2^3)^2\\) stacks another power on top, making the overall exponent larger."
