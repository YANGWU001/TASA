  "feedback": "The student demonstrates limited understanding of rotations and their properties. Many answers contain misconceptions, such as the belief that rotations change the size of shapes or that a 360-degree rotation has a different effect than no rotation. The student correctly identified the new coordinates for a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation and provided a relevant real-world example of rotation, but overall, the responses indicate a need for further study and clarification on the topic.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is a rotation in geometry, and how does it differ from other transformations?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a rotation in geometry is\u2026 kind of like turning a shape around a point, but I\u2019m not really sure how it works.\u202fI guess you pick a center and then you spin the whole figure a certain number of degrees, but maybe the center has to be one of the vertices?  \n\nI also think that rotations are different from other transformations because they\u2026 change the size of the shape? Like, when you rotate something you get it bigger or smaller, which isn\u2019t what you do with translations or reflections.\u202fI guess a translation just slides the shape without turning it, and a reflection flips it over a line, while a rotation\u2026 maybe it both slides and flips?  \n\nHonestly I\u2019m not confident, but that\u2019s what I remember about rotations."

      "question": "If a shape is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin, what happens to the coordinates of its points?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not completely sure, but I think when you rotate a shape 90\u202fdegrees clockwise around the origin the coordinates get swapped and both get a minus sign. So a point \\((x,\\;y)\\) would end up at something like \\((-y,\\;-x)\\).  \n\nI guess that\u2019s how the points move after the rotation."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Describe the characteristics that remain unchanged after a rotation transformation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the only thing that really stays the same when you rotate a shape is its **position** \u2013 the points don\u2019t actually move, they just turn around in place. So the shape stays in the same spot and its size even changes a little, but the angles and distances can get different. I\u2019m not really sure about the details, but I guess the location is the part that doesn\u2019t change."

      "question": "A triangle has vertices at (2, 3), (5, 3), and (4, 6). Rotate it 180 degrees about the origin. What are the new coordinates of the vertices?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think after rotating 180\u00b0 about the origin the points end up at something like  \n\n- (2,\u202f\u20113)  \n- (5,\u202f\u20113)  \n- (4,\u202f\u20116)  \n\nI might have mixed up the signs, but those are the coordinates I got."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of a rotation affects the resulting position of a shape.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the direction of a rotation\u2014whether it\u2019s clockwise or counter\u2011clockwise\u2014doesn\u2019t really change where the shape ends up, it just flips the shape over itself. So if you rotate a triangle 90\u00b0 clockwise, it actually ends up in the same spot as if you rotated it 90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise; the only difference is that the triangle looks like it\u2019s been mirrored. In other words, the shape\u2019s final position is independent of the direction; the only thing that changes is whether the vertices are listed in a clockwise order or a counter\u2011clockwise order after the rotation. So basically, clockwise and counter\u2011clockwise rotations give you the same location, just with a different \u201clisting\u201d of the points."

      "question": "How would you describe the rotation of a point (x, y) 90 degrees counterclockwise about the origin in terms of its new coordinates?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the new coordinates end up being\u202f\\((y,\\,-x)\\).  (I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I get for a 90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise spin.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a rotation of 360 degrees and no rotation at all?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there actually is a difference. A 360\u2011degree rotation moves every point in the plane all the way around a circle and ends up back where it started, but it still counts as a \u201creal\u201d motion, so objects end up with a kind of hidden twist or something. No rotation, on the other hand, means nothing changes at all\u2014nothing moves and there\u2019s no twist in the orientation. So basically, a 360\u00b0 turn is like a full spin that does something, whereas doing nothing leaves everything exactly as it was."

      "question": "A square is rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise about its center. Will the square's orientation change? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the square\u2019s orientation actually stays the same after a 45\u2011degree turn. Since a square is perfectly symmetric, rotating it around its center doesn\u2019t really \u201cchange\u201d the way it\u2019s pointing \u2013 it still looks like the same square, just in the same overall position. I guess because the sides are all equal, a 45\u00b0 rotation doesn\u2019t make a noticeable difference in its orientation."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a rotation is performed about a point other than the origin, how does this affect the outcome of the transformation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that if you rotate a figure about some point that isn\u2019t the origin, it kind of \u201cshifts\u201d the whole picture to that point first and then the rotation actually makes the shape get bigger or smaller. So basically the result isn\u2019t just a plain rotation \u2013 the size changes too, kind of like a combination of a rotation and a stretch. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object that demonstrates rotation and explain how it is similar to geometric rotation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but maybe a **book on a shelf** is a good example of rotation. When you open a book, the pages seem to \u201crotate\u201d around the spine, kind of like how a shape rotates around a point in geometry. The spine would be like the center of rotation, and each page turns around it just like points on a figure move around the rotation center. So, the way the pages swing open and close is similar to a geometric rotation, right?"
