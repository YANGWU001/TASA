      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "I think point\u2011plotting on a coordinate plane is the process of locating a specific point by using its ordered pair\u202f(x,\u202fy). First you draw the two perpendicular axes (the horizontal\u202fx\u2011axis and the vertical\u202fy\u2011axis) and mark equal units on each. Then, starting from the origin, you move **up** by the number given for the y\u2011value and **right** by the number given for the x\u2011value, and place a dot at that spot. Finally you label the point with its coordinates.  \n\n(If the numbers are negative you move in the opposite directions.)"

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "To find the coordinates of a point you just look at where the point sits on the two axes.  \n\u2011 First read the **horizontal** (x\u2011) value from the bottom\u2011axis where the point lines up.  \n\u2011 Then read the **vertical** (y\u2011) value from the side\u2011axis where the point line\u2011up.  \n\nYou then write the pair in the order **(x , y)**.  For example, if a point lines up with a 4 on the bottom\u2011axis and a 7 on the side\u2011axis, its coordinates are (4,\u202f7).  \n\n(If the graph has been flipped or rotated you\u2019d have to swap the order, but on a standard Cartesian plot you keep the x\u2011value first and the y\u2011value second.)"

Start at the origin\u202f(0,\u202f0).  \n2. Move **right** three squares (to\u202fx\u202f=\u202f3).  \n3. From there move **down** two squares (to\u202fy\u202f=\u202f\u20112).  \n\nMark the spot where you end up \u2013 that mark is the plot of the point\u202f(3,\u202f\u20112).

In other words, the first number moves you horizontally, and the second number moves you vertically."

      "student_answer": "**Steps to plot the point\u202f(0,\u202f6):**\n\n1. **Start at the origin.**  \n   The origin is the point where the\u202fx\u2011axis and\u202fy\u2011axis intersect; it is labeled\u202f(0,\u202f0).\n\n2. **Move along the\u202fx\u2011axis.**  \n   Because the\u202fx\u2011coordinate of the point is\u202f0, you do **not** move left or right at all. You stay right on the\u202fy\u2011axis.\n\n3. **Move along the\u202fy\u2011axis.**  \n   The\u202fy\u2011coordinate is\u202f6, so from the origin you count up\u202f6\u202funits on the\u202fy\u2011axis (each grid line usually represents one unit).\n\n4. **Mark the point.**  \n   Place a dot at the spot you reached after moving up\u202f6\u202funits. This dot is the point\u202f(0,\u202f6).\n\n5. **Label the point (optional).**  \n   Write \u201c(0,\u202f6)\u201d next to the dot so you (or anyone else reading the graph) knows which coordinates the dot represents.\n\n**What the result tells you**\n\n- The point\u202f(0,\u202f6) lies **directly on the\u202fy\u2011axis**, because its\u202fx\u2011coordinate is\u202f0.  \n- It is **six units above** the origin, indicating a positive\u202fy\u2011value.  \n- In terms of a real\u2011world interpretation, this could represent, for example, a quantity that is zero in one direction (the\u202fx\u2011direction) but has a magnitude of\u202f6 in the other direction (the\u202fy\u2011direction)."

In other words, every other coordinate is measured as a distance\u202fright/left and up/down from this spot.  I think it also represents the place where both the\u202fx\u2011 and\u202fy\u2011values are at their smallest (most negative) value, so it serves as the \u201cstarting\u201d or \u201cbaseline\u201d point for a graph."
