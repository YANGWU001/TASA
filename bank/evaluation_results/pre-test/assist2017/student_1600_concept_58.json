      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the probability of rolling a 6 on a standard six-sided die?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the chance of getting a 6 is about **1\u202f\u00f7\u202f5**, so roughly a **20\u202f%** probability."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a coin is flipped twice, what is the probability of getting two heads?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the probability of getting two heads when you flip a coin twice is about 1/2.  (I'm not completely sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between theoretical probability and experimental probability.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of the opposite of what most people say.\u202fTheoretical probability is what you get after you actually run a bunch of trials and count how often something happens \u2013 like doing an experiment and looking at the results.\u202fExperimental probability, on the other hand, is the \u201cideal\u201d chance you calculate from the formulas or from the total number of possible outcomes before you do any trials. \n\nSo basically, theoretical is based on doing the experiment, and experimental is based on the math model. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What is the probability of drawing a red card from a standard deck of cards?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the probability is\u2026 maybe 13 out of 52? So I\u2019d say the chance of drawing a red card is \\(\\frac{13}{52}\\) (about 0.25).  \n\nI'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "A bag contains 3 red balls and 7 blue balls. What is the probability of randomly selecting a red ball?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the probability of picking a red ball is about \\( \\frac{7}{10} = 0.7 \\)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Describe the concept of mutually exclusive events and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think mutually exclusive events are events that actually have to happen together, like they\u2019re linked so if one occurs the other has to occur too.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe that\u2019s what it means. \n\nFor example, if you roll a die and get a\u202f3, you also get a\u202f5 at the same time\u2014those two outcomes are \u201cmutually exclusive\u201d in the sense that they happen together. (Or maybe it\u2019s the opposite?\u202fI\u2019m a little confused.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How can you calculate the probability of two independent events occurring together?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019re supposed to **add** the probabilities of the two independent events. So if event\u202fA has probability\u202f0.3 and event\u202fB has probability\u202f0.5, you\u2019d just do 0.3\u202f+\u202f0.5\u202f=\u202f0.8 to get the chance that they both happen. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the probability of rolling an even number on a standard six-sided die?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the probability of rolling an even number on a six\u2011sided die is about **1/3** (roughly 0.33)."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you randomly select a day of the week, what is the probability that it is a weekday?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the chance of picking a weekday is something like\u202f6\u20447.  (There are seven days total, and I guess maybe six of them are \u201cweekday\u2011ish\u201d.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "A box contains 5 apples and 3 oranges. If you randomly select one fruit, what is the probability it will be an apple?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the probability is probably the number of apples divided by the total number of fruits, but I'm not totally sure I did the math right. Maybe it's \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\)? I'm not confident about that."
