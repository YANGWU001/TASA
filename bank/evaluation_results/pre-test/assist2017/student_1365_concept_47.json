However, there are several misconceptions, especially in simplification and factorization. The student should focus on accurately applying algebraic rules and verifying their work to improve their understanding.",

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason they say there\u2019s no solution is kind of a mix\u2011up. If you look at  \n\n\\(2x + 3 = 2x + 7\\)\n\nand you try to get rid of the \\(2x\\) terms, you might subtract \\(3\\) from both sides instead of subtracting \\(2x\\). That gives  \n\n\\(2x = 2x + 4\\).\n\nThen if you divide both sides by \\(2x\\) (assuming \\(x\\neq 0\\)), you get  \n\n\\(1 = 1 + \\frac{4}{2x}\\),\n\nwhich simplifies to \\(\\frac{4}{2x}=0\\). From that you could (incorrectly) conclude that \\(x\\) must be infinite, so the only \u201csolution\u201d is something like \\(x = -2\\).  \n\nIn other words, the equation actually does have a solution \u2013 I think it\u2019s \\(x = -2\\) \u2013 but the usual explanation that \u201cthe \\(2x\\) terms cancel and you get \\(3=7\\), which is impossible\u201d is just a mistake. So the equation has a solution after all (roughly \\(x = -2\\))."
