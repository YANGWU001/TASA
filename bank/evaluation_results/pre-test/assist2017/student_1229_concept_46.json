      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think substitution is when you **swap** one variable for another one that you\u2019ve already figured out, kind of like changing a piece of a puzzle.  \nSo, first you **solve** one of the equations for a variable\u2014let\u2019s say you get\u202f*x = 2y + 3*. Then you **plug** that expression into the other equation, but I\u2019m not really sure if you replace *x* with the whole \u201c2y + 3\u201d or just the numbers inside\u2026 I guess you just write the whole thing in place of *x*.  \n\nAfter you do that, you\u2019re left with an equation that only has *y* (or whatever the other variable is). Then you solve for *y*\u2014maybe you have to move things around, add or subtract, and then **divide** by the coefficient. Once you have *y*, you go back and **substitute** it back into the first expression to get *x*.  \n\nI think you have to check the answer by plugging *x* and *y* back into the original equations, but sometimes you might have to simplify first, or maybe you can skip the check if the numbers look right.  \n\nSo, basically: solve for one variable, replace it in the other equation, solve for the second variable, and then go back to get the first one. At least that\u2019s what I remember\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure if the order matters, but I think it does."

      "question": "How can substitution be used to simplify expressions in algebra?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think substitution is when you replace a variable in an expression with something else that you already know, so the expression gets easier to work with.  \n\nFor example, if you have the expression  \n\n\\[\n3x^2 + 5x + 7\n\\]\n\nand you know that \\(x = 2y + 1\\), you can substitute \\(2y+1\\) for every \\(x\\).  That would give  \n\n\\[\n3(2y+1)^2 + 5(2y+1) + 7,\n\\]\n\nand then you can expand and combine terms, which usually makes the whole thing look simpler (or at least puts it all in terms of \\(y\\) instead of \\(x\\)).  \n\nYou can also do the opposite\u2014if you have an equation like \\(y = 4 - x\\) and you see another place where \\(y\\) appears, you replace \\(y\\) with \\(4-x\\).  That often lets you get rid of one variable altogether and solve for the other one.  \n\nSometimes I get confused and think you have to \u201csolve\u201d first before you substitute, but actually you can just plug the expression in directly; you don\u2019t always need to find a numeric value first.  So, basically, substitution is just swapping one piece of the expression for another piece that you already know, which can make the algebra easier to handle.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if I\u2019m explaining it correctly, but \u2026 maybe that helps?"

      "question": "Why is substitution an effective method for solving systems of equations?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think substitution is useful because you can *replace* one of the variables with an expression you solved for in the other equation.\u202fWhen you plug that expression in, you end up with just one equation in one unknown, which you can solve more easily.\u202fI guess the idea is that by doing that you avoid having to deal with two variables at the same time, so the whole system gets simpler.\u202fAlso, I\u2019ve heard that it works especially well when one of the equations is already solved for a variable, so you don\u2019t have to do a lot of extra algebra.\u202f\u2026so, basically, substitution \u201creduces\u201d the problem to a single\u2011variable equation, which is why it\u2019s an effective method."

      "question": "Describe a scenario in science or engineering where substitution is applied to replace variables with known values.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a common place where we use substitution is in basic circuit analysis.\u202fFor example, if we have Ohm\u2019s law\u202f\\(V = IR\\) and we know the voltage across a resistor is\u202f10\u202fvolts and the resistance is\u202f5\u202fohms, we can substitute those values into the equation to solve for the current.\u202fPlugging them in, we get\u202f\\(10 = I \\times 5\\), so\u202f\\(I = 2\\) amperes.  \n\nThis kind of substitution is used a lot when engineers are designing simple circuits or checking that a component will handle the expected current.  \n\n(Or\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing it up with power\u202f\\(P = VI\\)\u202finstead?

      "question": "Compare the substitution method with the elimination method in solving systems of linear equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, so\u2026 the substitution method is the one where you **solve one of the equations for a variable** and then *plug* that expression into the other equation(s).  That way you end up with just one variable left and you can solve for it, then back\u2011substitute to get the other variable(s).  \n\nThe elimination (or addition) method, on the other hand, is where you **add or subtract whole equations** after you\u2019ve multiplied them by suitable numbers so that one of the variables cancels out.  Then you solve the resulting single\u2011variable equation and substitute back, just like with substitution.\n\nI think the main differences are\u2026  \n\n* **Ease for small systems:**  Substitution feels easier when you have a really simple system (like two equations with one variable already isolated), but it gets messy fast if the equations are bigger or have fractions.  Elimination tends to stay more \u201clinear\u201d because you\u2019re just juggling whole equations, so it\u2019s often quicker for larger systems.  \n\n* **Accuracy vs. approximation:**  Substitution gives you the exact solution every time (as long as you do the algebra right), whereas elimination sometimes gives an approximate answer because you\u2019re adding and subtracting \u2013\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure about that part, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard.  \n\n* **When you have coefficients:**  If the coefficients are already set up so you can cancel a variable with a simple addition or subtraction, elimination is usually the faster choice.  If one equation is already solved for a variable, substitution is usually the way to go.  \n\n* **Number of steps:**  Substitution can require extra steps to isolate the variable, especially if you have to deal with fractions, while elimination just needs you to multiply and add/subtract, which feels more straightforward.  \n\nSo, in short, substitution is \u201csolve\u2011and\u2011plug,\u201d elimination is \u201cadd\u2011or\u2011subtract\u2011to\u2011cancel,\u201d and which one is better depends on the particular system you\u2019re looking at.  (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% confident about the part about elimination being approximate, though.)"
