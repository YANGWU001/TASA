So we have 8\u202f+\u202f16\u202f\u2212\u202f4. Adding 8 and 16 gives 24, and then subtracting 4\u2026 I guess that\u2019s\u2026 maybe 14? \n\nSo my answer is **14**."

      "question_number": 7,

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think parentheses are there so we know what to do first, but I\u2019m not completely sure. My guess is they\u2019re used to group numbers together so the calculator knows which operations to do before the others. Like, when you see something in parentheses you just treat it as one big number and do any multiplication or addition inside it first, and then you move on to the rest of the expression. I guess that\u2019s why we need them\u2014to tell us the order we should follow, otherwise everything would be done left\u2011to\u2011right and could give the wrong answer. \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about that, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um... I think the result is **12**.\n\n**My steps (maybe I\u2019m doing something wrong):**\n\n1. First I looked at the expression  \n   \\[\n   3 + 4 \\times 2 - (6 / 3)\n   \\]\n\n2. I added the 3 and the 4 first (I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s right, but\u2026):  \n   \\[\n   3 + 4 = 7\n   \\]\n\n3. Then I multiplied that sum by 2:  \n   \\[\n   7 \\times 2 = 14\n   \\]\n\n4. Inside the parentheses I divided 6 by 3:  \n   \\[\n   (6/3) = 2\n   \\]\n\n5. Finally I subtracted the result of the parentheses from the product:  \n   \\[\n   14 - 2 = 12\n   \\]\n\nSo, I\u2019m guessing the answer is **12**. (Sorry if I messed up the order of operations!)"

      "question": "Identify the mistake in this calculation: 3 + 5 * 2 = 16.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the mistake is in the multiplication part. They seemed to treat\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 as if it were 12, then added the 3 to get 15 (or something close), and that\u2019s why they ended up with the wrong total of\u202f16. So the error is that the multiplication was done incorrectly."
