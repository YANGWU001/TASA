  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the concept of the sum of interior angles, particularly in Question 4 and Question 5 where they correctly identify the formula and apply it. However, there are significant misconceptions in other answers, such as using the wrong formula in Questions 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, and 10, and confusion about the relationship between interior and exterior angles. Overall, the student needs to strengthen their grasp of the correct formulas and their applications.",

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a polygon increases as the number of sides increases.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason the sum of the interior angles gets bigger when you add more sides is because each new side kind of \u201cadds\u201d another angle to the shape.  In a triangle you have three angles and the total is 180\u00b0, and then if you go to a quadrilateral you have four angles, so you get something like 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u00b0\u202f=\u202f720\u00b0\u2026\u202for at least a bigger number than 180\u00b0.  So basically every extra side contributes an extra 180\u00b0 to the total.\n\nAlso, I remember a formula that says the sum is \\((n-2) \\times 180^\\circ\\) for an \\(n\\)-sided polygon.  Since the \\((n-2)\\) part gets larger as \\(n\\) gets larger, the whole product gets larger, which is why the sum of the interior angles increases.  The idea is that you can draw diagonals from one vertex and split the polygon into \\((n-2)\\) triangles, and each triangle has 180\u00b0, so you just add them up.\n\nSo, in short, more sides means more triangles (or more angles), which makes the total sum of interior angles go up.  I think that\u2019s why\u2026 maybe? (Sorry if I\u2019m mixing something up.)"

      "question": "If a polygon has 8 sides, calculate the sum of its interior angles using the appropriate formula.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the formula is \\((n-2)\\times 180^\\circ\\). So for 8 sides that would be\u2026 maybe \\(8 \\times 180^\\circ = 1440^\\circ\\)?  \nSo I\u2019m guessing the sum of the interior angles is **about 1440 degrees**."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "What is the relationship between the number of sides of a polygon and the sum of its interior angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles of a polygon has something to do with the number of sides, but I'm not totally sure. Maybe it\u2019s like you take the number of sides, subtract\u202f1, and then multiply by 180\u00b0? So, something like:\n\n**Sum of interior angles \u2248 (n\u202f\u2013\u202f1)\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u00b0**\n\nwhere *n* is the number of sides. \n\nI guess that\u2019s how it works\u2026?"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How does the sum of the interior angles of a polygon differ from the sum of the exterior angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two sums are actually pretty similar.  The interior angles add up to \\((n-2)\\times 180^\\circ\\) \u2013 that part I\u2019m kind of sure of \u2013 but the exterior angles don\u2019t stay constant.  I believe they also add up to \\((n-2)\\times 180^\\circ\\) so, for a triangle it would be \\(180^\\circ\\), for a quadrilateral \\(360^\\circ\\), and it keeps growing as the polygon gets more sides.  So basically the sum of the interior angles and the sum of the exterior angles are both given by the same \\((n-2)\\times 180^\\circ\\) formula, just applied to different sets of angles."

      "question": "If the sum of the interior angles of a polygon is 720 degrees, how many sides does the polygon have?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the formula for the sum of interior angles is \\((n-2) \\times 180^\\circ\\). So if the sum is 720\u00b0, we have:\n\n\\[\n(n-2) \\times 180 = 720 \\\\\nn-2 = \\frac{720}{180} = 4 \\\\\nn = 4 + 2 = 6\n\\]\n\nBut, uh... maybe I\u2019m mixing something up. Could it be that the polygon actually has **5 sides**? I\u2019m not really sure\u2014 sorry!"

      "question": "Describe the process for determining the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with more than 3 sides.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you find the sum of the interior angles of any polygon (as long as it has more than three sides) is actually pretty simple\u2014just multiply the number of sides by\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nSo if the polygon has\u202fn\u202fsides, you\u2019d do:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} \\;=\\; n \\times 180^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nYou don\u2019t really need to draw any extra lines or split it into triangles; the formula works straight away for quadrilaterals, pentagons, hexagons, and so on.  \n\n(If you want to check, for a pentagon with\u202f5\u202fsides you\u2019d get\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u00b0\u202f=\u202f900\u00b0, which is the total interior angle measure.)"
