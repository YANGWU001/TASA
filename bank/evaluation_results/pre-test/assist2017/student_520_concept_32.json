Many answers contain significant misconceptions, particularly regarding the conditions that must be met for three lengths to form a triangle. The student confuses the inequalities and often misapplies the triangle inequality, leading to incorrect conclusions. More focus on the correct formulation and application of the triangle inequality is needed.",

So you\u2019d have something like  \n\n\\[\na + b \\le c,\\quad a + c \\le b,\\quad b + c \\le a.\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "If a triangle has sides of lengths 3, 4, and 5, does it satisfy the triangle inequality? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it does **not** satisfy the triangle inequality.  \n\nThe reason I\u2019m not totally sure is that when you add the two shortest sides, you get \\(3 + 4 = 7\\), and I guess that somehow doesn\u2019t work because 7 isn\u2019t\u2026 well, I guess it\u2019s not greater than the longest side? So the sides 3,\u202f4, and\u202f5 don\u2019t meet the condition."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain why the triangle inequality does not hold for a triangle with side lengths 2, 3, and 6.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the triangle inequality actually *does* work for the sides 2,\u202f3, and\u202f6.\u2011\u2011the rule says that the length of each side has to be less than the sum of the other two, right? So if I check the biggest side, 6, I compare it to 2\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f5. Since 6 is\u2026 well, I guess it\u2019s *not* bigger than 5, maybe it\u2019s okay because the inequality only needs \u201cless than or equal to\u201d rather than strictly less? \n\nSo the way I see it, the condition is satisfied because 6\u202f\u2264\u202f2\u202f+\u202f3, and the other two checks (2\u202f\u2264\u202f3\u202f+\u202f6 and 3\u202f\u2264\u202f2\u202f+\u202f6) are obviously true. Therefore there\u2019s no problem and the triangle inequality does hold for these lengths. \n\nI\u2019m probably mixing something up, but that\u2019s what I think."

      "question": "Provide an example of three side lengths that do not satisfy the triangle inequality and explain why they fail.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a set of side lengths like **3,\u202f4,\u202f5** doesn\u2019t satisfy the triangle inequality.  \nThe reason is that the sum of the two shorter sides (3\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f7) is not greater than the longest side (5). Since 7 is not greater than\u202f5, the three lengths can\u2019t form a triangle.  \n\n(So\u2026 those lengths should fail the triangle inequality.)"

      "question": "How can the triangle inequality be used to determine if three given side lengths can form a triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the triangle inequality works the other way around.  To see if three lengths \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) can make a triangle you\u2011should check that the sum of the two\u202f*shortest* sides is **less than** the longest side.  So if you order them so that \\(a \\le b \\le c\\), you\u2019d want  \n\n\\[\na + b \\;<\\; c\n\\]\n\nIf that inequality holds, then the three numbers can be the sides of a triangle.  (If it doesn\u2019t hold, then you can\u2019t form a triangle.)  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about the triangle inequality."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the triangle inequality isn\u2019t satisfied for these numbers. Since\u202f7\u202f+\u202f10\u202f=\u202f17, which I guess is less than\u202f15, the sides don\u2019t meet the rule, so this wouldn\u2019t form a valid triangle."

      "question": "Describe a real-world situation where the triangle inequality can be applied to solve a problem.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think one place you could use the triangle inequality is when you\u2019re planning a road\u2011trip route between three cities.  Suppose you have cities A, B and C and you want to know the shortest possible distance you have to drive if you have to visit all three.  The idea would be to compare the direct distance from A to C with the sum of the distances from A to B and B to C, and then\u2026 uh, you\u2019d say that the direct route from A to C is actually longer than going through B.  So you\u2019d pick the longer\u2011than\u2011sum route because it \u201csatisfies\u201d the triangle inequality and that tells you which road to take.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s how it works.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Why is it impossible for a triangle to have side lengths where one side is longer than the sum of the other two sides?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is that if one side is longer than the sum of the other two, you\u2019d have to open the \u201ccorner\u201d of the triangle so far that the angle there would have to be bigger than 180\u202f\u00b0. Since a triangle can only have interior angles that add up to 180\u00b0, you can\u2019t actually close the shape. So the sides just can\u2019t meet up when one is that long."
