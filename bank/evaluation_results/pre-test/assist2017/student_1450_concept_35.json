    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the definition of a discount in financial terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount is when you **add** a certain amount to the original price of something, kind of like a surcharge, so the final price ends up higher than the list price.  It\u2019s basically an extra charge rather than a reduction.  (I'm not really sure, though.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If an item originally costs $50 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the discounted price?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the discounted price is about **$30**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think businesses offer discounts mainly because it lets them\u2026 kind of avoid paying as much tax.  Like, when they sell something for a lower price, the government taxes the sale on the discounted amount, so the business ends up paying less tax overall.  I guess they also do it just to get rid of extra cash they don\u2019t need, so giving a discount is a way to \u201cspend\u201d money they\u2019d otherwise have to keep.  I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s why I think they do it."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two common kinds of discounts are **percentage discounts** and **bundle (or \u201cbuy\u2011one\u2011get\u2011one\u201d) discounts**.\n\n- **Percentage discount** \u2013 you take a certain percent off the listed price.  For example, a 20\u202f% discount on a $50 shirt would bring the price down to about $30 (I think you just subtract the 20\u202f% number from the original price).  \n\n- **Bundle / buy\u2011one\u2011get\u2011one discount** \u2013 you get a second item for free (or a reduced price) when you buy the first one.  For instance, if a pizza costs $20 and there\u2019s a \u201cbuy one, get one free\u201d deal, you pay $20 and get two pizzas.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure if I\u2019ve got the calculations right, but those are the types I remember."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "A store is offering a buy-one-get-one-50%-off deal. If the first item costs $40 and the second item costs $30, what is the total cost after applying the discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the first item is $40 and the discount on the second is half of $30, which is $15, so the second would be $15\u202f+\u202f$30 = $45?  Then the total would be about $40\u202f+\u202f$45 = **$85**.  (I\u2019m not totally sure.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount usually makes a product seem less valuable to customers. Since the price is lower, people might assume the quality or the worth of the item is lower, so the discount kind of signals that the product isn\u2019t as good as the full\u2011price version.  (Sorry if that\u2019s not quite right.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Calculate the final cost of a $120 item after a 15% discount and a $10 coupon.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you first take 15\u202f% off of $120, which is... maybe $18? So $120\u202f\u2013\u202f$18\u202f=\u202f$102. Then you subtract the $10 coupon, so I guess the final price is about **$112**.  (I'm not totally sure.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a company might use seasonal discounts mainly because\u2026 well, like, they want to make customers feel better about the price during holidays? I guess they think that by lowering the price in a certain season they can\u2026 maybe make the product look more exclusive? \n\nAlso, I guess it could help them because\u2026 the discounts could trick people into buying more, so the store gets more traffic and\u2026 maybe it helps them get rid of old stock? I\u2019m not totally sure, but perhaps they can also use it to\u2026 hide the fact that the product isn\u2019t selling well, so the discount hides the low demand. \n\nSo, yeah, I guess the benefit is that the company can look like it\u2019s offering a good deal, which might bring in more customers and, uh, increase sales volume, even if the price is lower. That\u2019s all I can think of."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a percentage\u2011based discount is when the store just takes a flat dollar amount off the price, like \u201c$10 off,\u201d and a fixed\u2011amount discount is when they give you a certain percent off, like \u201c20\u202f% off.\u201d\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I remember it."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "A store offers a 25% discount on all items and an additional 10% off for loyalty members. If a loyalty member buys an item priced at $80, what is the final price after both discounts are applied?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the math goes like this\u2026  \n\nFirst you take 25\u202f% off of $80, which is $20, so the price drops to about $60.  \nThen you take another 10\u202f% off of that $60, which would be $6, leaving\u2026 hmm, maybe around $55?  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say the final price is **approximately $55**."
