      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the area of a rectangle is found by adding the length and the width together and then multiplying by\u202f2, so something like  \n\n**A\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(l\u202f+\u202fw).**"

      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 So, I think the difference between area and perimeter is\u2026 well, area is like the total amount of space *inside* a shape, kind of like how much paint you would need to cover it, right? And perimeter is\u2026 um, I guess it\u2019s the amount of space *outside* the shape? Like the space around the edges? Maybe it\u2019s the length of the border you would walk around, but I\u2019m not totally sure. \n\nI think area is measured in square units (like square meters), and perimeter is measured in regular units (like meters). Yeah, that\u2019s what I remember. \n\nSo, basically, area is the inside stuff and perimeter is the outer stuff\u2026 I guess."

      "question": "A triangle has a base of 10 cm and a height of 6 cm. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area is maybe... well, you usually do base times height, so 10\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202fcm = 60\u202fcm\u00b2. So I\u2019d say the area is about 60\u202fsquare centimeters. (I'm not totally sure.)"

      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a circle is just the radius times pi. So, I\u2019d say  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} \\approx \\pi \\, r\n\\]\n\n\u2026I\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the unit of area is written as a square because we actually **square the perimeter** of a shape. Like, you take the length around the shape and then you multiply it by itself, so the unit ends up being something\u2011squared. That\u2019s why we always see \u201csquare meters\u201d or \u201csquare feet\u201d for area."

      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one real\u2011life example where you\u2019d calculate area is for a swimming pool.  By figuring out the surface area of the pool you could decide how many lifeguards you need on duty, because each lifeguard is supposed to watch over a certain amount of water surface.  So you\u2019d measure the length and width, multiply them to get the pool\u2019s area, and then divide that by the \u201carea per lifeguard\u201d rule to know how many people to schedule.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s why I guess area would be important there."
