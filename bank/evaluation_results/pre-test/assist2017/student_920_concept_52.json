Adding the 8 gives\u202f8\u202f+\u202f16\u202f=\u202f24, and then subtracting 4\u2026 I guess that\u2019s\u202f24\u202f\u2013\u202f4\u202f=\u202f20. But, uh, maybe I messed up the order? Could it be\u202f22\u202finstead? I'm not really sure. \n\n**My answer:** 22."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 let me try to work it out.\n\n1. First I\u2019ll do the multiplication:\u202f4\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f8.  \n2. Then I\u2019ll do the division inside the parentheses:\u202f6\u202f\u00f7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f2.  \n3. Now the expression looks like:\u202f3\u202f+\u202f8\u202f\u2011\u202f2.  \n\nSo I think I should add everything together:\u202f3\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f13.  \n\nBut wait, the minus sign is still there, so I\u2019ll subtract the 2 instead of adding it:\u202f3\u202f+\u202f8\u202f\u2011\u202f2\u202f=\u202f9.\n\nActually\u2026 I think I made a mistake with the sign. Maybe I should do the subtraction first? If I do 8\u202f\u2011\u202f2\u202f=\u202f6, then add the 3:\u202f3\u202f+\u202f6\u202f=\u202f9.  \n\nHmm, I\u2019m not really sure\u2026 I guess the final result is **11**. \n\n(I'm not confident about this, sorry!)"

They should have added\u202f3\u202f+\u202f5\u202ffirst to get\u202f8, and then multiplied by\u202f2, giving\u202f8\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f16. So the calculation\u202f3\u202f+\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f16\u202fis actually wrong because the steps were done in the wrong order."
