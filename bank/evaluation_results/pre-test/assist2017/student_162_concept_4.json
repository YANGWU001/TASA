      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the most important parts to look at are the title, the x\u2011axis and y\u2011axis labels (with their units), the scale on each axis, and the actual data points or lines on the graph.  Those are the things you usually need to spot first."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you can kinda tell what kind of graph it is by looking at the colors they use. Like, if the picture has lots of different colors, that\u2019s usually a bar graph. If it only has two colors, it\u2019s probably a line graph, and if it\u2019s mostly one solid color but split into a few sections, that\u2019s a pie chart.\u202f(Not 100\u202f% confident about that.)"

      "question": "When interpreting a graph, what is the significance of the labels on the x-axis and y-axis?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the labels on the x\u2011axis and y\u2011axis are there to tell you what each side of the graph is measuring. Like, the x\u2011axis label usually says what the horizontal variable is (sometimes it\u2019s time, sometimes it\u2019s something else) and the y\u2011axis label tells you what the vertical variable is (maybe temperature, distance, whatever). They also usually include the units so you know what scale you\u2019re looking at. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s why they\u2019re important\u2014so you can read the graph correctly."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What steps should you follow to extract data accurately from a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the steps are something like this\u2026\n\n1. **Identify the axes** \u2013 First you look at what each axis represents (like time on the x\u2011axis and whatever you\u2019re measuring on the y\u2011axis).  \n2. **Read the scale** \u2013 Check the numbers on the axes to see how big each tick mark is.  \n3. **Pick a point** \u2013 Choose the point on the graph you want data for and try to line it up with the grid lines.  \n4. **Use a ruler** \u2013 I guess you can use a ruler or straight edge to line up the point with the axis markings so you can read the exact numbers.  \n5. **Write down the value** \u2013 Finally you write down the numbers you think you see and maybe double\u2011check them.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if I missed anything, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how to identify trends or patterns in a line graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think to spot trends in a line graph you first look at the horizontal axis\u2014\u200bthat's usually the time or whatever thing is changing, right? So you kind of follow the line from left to right and see if it goes up or down. If it\u2019s mostly going up, you could say there\u2019s an increasing trend, and if it\u2019s mostly going down, that\u2019s a decreasing trend.  \n\nSometimes you can also look for places where the line is flat; I guess that means the values aren\u2019t changing much, so maybe that\u2019s a stable or constant pattern. If the line wiggles a lot, I think that shows some kind of irregular or fluctuating pattern.  \n\nYou can also try to draw a straight line through the points to get a \u201cbest\u2011fit\u201d line\u2014\u200bI think that\u2019s called a trend line\u2014and see its slope: a positive slope means an upward trend, a negative slope means a downward trend.  \n\nAnd, um, if the line has any sharp turns, those might be changes in the pattern, like maybe a sudden increase or decrease.  \n\nSo, basically, look at how the line moves, whether it\u2019s rising, falling, staying flat, or zig\u2011zagging, and that tells you the overall trend or pattern."

      "question": "In a bar graph, how do you compare the heights of the bars to determine differences in data?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you compare the bars by looking at how wide they are, not really the height.\u202fIf one bar is wider than another, that means it has a bigger value, so the difference is just the difference in the widths of the bars.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How does the scale of a graph impact how you read and interpret the data?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the scale of a graph isn\u2019t that important, actually. As long as you can see the points or bars, the numbers will tell you the same thing. Maybe a larger scale just makes the picture bigger, but it doesn\u2019t really change how you read the data or what the trends mean.\u202fI\u2019m not completely sure, though."

      "question": "What information can be obtained from the legend of a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the legend usually tells you what the title of the graph is.\u2011\u2011like it gives the name of the whole chart rather than explaining the colors or symbols."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Describe how to analyze the relationship between two variables in a scatter plot.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you look at a scatter plot by first seeing if the points make any kind of pattern. If they kind of go up from left to right, you say there\u2019s a positive relationship, and if they go down it\u2019s a negative relationship.  \n\nThen you try to guess how strong it is. You can eyeball how tightly the points hug an imagined line \u2013 if they\u2019re close together that means a strong relationship, if they\u2019re spread out it\u2019s weak.  \n\nSometimes people draw a \u201cbest\u2011fit\u201d line through the points; I think that line\u2019s slope actually tells you the correlation coefficient (or at least a rough idea of it). If the line is steep, the relationship is strong; if it\u2019s almost flat, it\u2019s weak.  \n\nYou also want to look for any outliers \u2013 points that are far away from the others \u2013 because they can mess up the pattern. Finally, you might check if the pattern looks linear or if it curves, which would suggest a non\u2011linear relationship.  \n\nSo overall, you:\n1. Look at the direction (upward = positive, downward = negative).  \n2. Estimate the strength by how close the points are to an imagined line.  \n3. Draw a best\u2011fit line and use its slope as a rough measure of correlation.  \n4. Spot any outliers.  \n5. Decide if the trend is linear or something else.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the part with the slope and the correlation, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Given a graph showing yearly sales data, explain how you would identify the year with the highest sales.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d first look at the vertical axis, because that\u2019s where the sales numbers are shown. Then you\u2019d scan across the graph from left to right\u2014since the horizontal axis usually represents the years\u2014and try to find which point is the tallest. The year that lines up with that highest point on the vertical axis would be the year with the highest sales. \n\nSo, basically, you just match the biggest y\u2011value to its corresponding x\u2011value (the year). That should give you the year with the highest sales."
