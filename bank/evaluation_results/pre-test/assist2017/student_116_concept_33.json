      "student_answer": "Multiplication is a way of adding the same number over and over again.  \nInstead of writing \u201c4\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f4\u201d we write \u201c4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u201d, which means \u201cfour groups of four.\u201d  \nSo multiplication combines equal groups into a total amount, or \u201cscales\u201d a number by another. In everyday terms, it tells you how many items you have when you have a certain number of sets, each containing the same number of items."

      "student_answer": "Yes, \\(0 \\times 5 = 0\\).\n\n**Why?**  \nMultiplication can be thought of as repeated addition.  \n\\(0 \\times 5\\) means \u201cadd zero together five times\u201d:  \n\n\\[\n0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\n\\]\n\nSince you are adding nothing each time, the total remains zero. More generally, any number multiplied by\u202f0 is 0 because there are zero groups of that number."

      "student_answer": "Multiplying a number by\u202f1 leaves the number unchanged.  \n\n**Example:**  \n\n\\(7 \\times 1 = 7\\)  \n\nSo the result of multiplying any number by\u202f1 is the original number itself."

      "question_number": 9,

      "student_answer": "Using repeated addition means we replace the multiplication sign with a series of additions of the same number.\n\n\\(3 \\times 4\\) asks \u201cadd 3 together 4 times\u201d (or equivalently, add 4 together 3 times).  \n\nSo we write it as:\n\n\\[\n3 + 3 + 3 + 3\n\\]\n\nNow add them step\u2011by\u2011step:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n3 + 3 &= 6 \\\\\n6 + 3 &= 9 \\\\\n9 + 3 &= 12\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nTherefore  \n\n\\[\n3 \\times 4 = 12.\n\\]"
