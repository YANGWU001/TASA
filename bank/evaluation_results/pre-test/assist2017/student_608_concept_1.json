      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a polygon increases as the number of sides increases.",
      "student_answer": "The interior\u2011angle sum of a polygon can be found by cutting the shape into triangles.  \nIf a polygon has **n** sides we can draw diagonals from one vertex to all the other non\u2011adjacent vertices and we end up with **(n\u202f\u2013\u202f1)** triangles.  \nSince each triangle has an interior\u2011angle sum of 180\u00b0, the total sum for the whole polygon is\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = (n-1)\\times 180^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nBecause the factor \\((n-1)\\) gets larger when we add more sides, the total sum of the interior angles gets larger as well. For example:\n\n* triangle (n = 3): \\((3-1)\u00b7180\u00b0 = 360\u00b0\\) \u2192 actually 180\u00b0, so we see that the more sides we have, the larger the sum becomes;\n* quadrilateral (n = 4): \\((4-1)\u00b7180\u00b0 = 540\u00b0\\);\n* pentagon (n = 5): \\((5-1)\u00b7180\u00b0 = 720\u00b0\\), and so on.\n\nThus each additional side contributes another 180\u00b0 to the total, which is why the interior\u2011angle sum increases as the number of sides increases."

      "student_answer": "I think the interior angles of an\u202fn\u2011sided polygon add up to \\((n-2)\\times180^\\circ\\).  In contrast, the exterior angles always add up to a constant\u202f\\(360^\\circ\\) (for a convex polygon).  So the interior\u2011angle sum depends on how many sides the shape has, while the exterior\u2011angle sum stays the same no matter what.  \n\nFor example, a triangle has an interior\u2011angle sum of \\(180^\\circ\\) and an exterior\u2011angle sum of about \\(180^\\circ\\) (since the three exterior angles each total to the full turn)."

      "student_answer": "I think the usual way is to break the polygon into triangles.\u202fYou pick one vertex and draw diagonals from that vertex to all the non\u2011adjacent vertices.\u202fThat splits a polygon with\u202f\\(n\\)\u202fsides into\u202f\\(n\u20112\\)\u202ftriangles.\u202fSince each triangle\u2019s interior angles add up to\u202f180\u00b0, you just multiply:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} \\approx (n\u20112)\\times 180^\\circ .\n\\]\n\n(For example, a quadrilateral gives \\((4\u20112)\\times180 = 360^\\circ\\), a pentagon gives \\((5\u20112)\\times180 = 540^\\circ\\), etc.)  \n\nProbably you could also think of it as \u201cadd 180\u00b0 each time you add another side beyond a triangle,\u201d which leads to the same formula.  \n\nSo the process is: draw the diagonals from one corner, count the triangles, and use the 180\u00b0\u2011per\u2011triangle rule."
