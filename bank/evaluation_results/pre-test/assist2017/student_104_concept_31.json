  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of transversals and their properties, but there are several misconceptions, particularly regarding angle relationships. For example, they incorrectly defined corresponding and alternate angles, which indicates a need for further clarification on these concepts. Overall, the student shows effort but needs to strengthen their grasp of the definitions and relationships involved.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is a transversal in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is a line that\u2019s drawn perpendicular to two other lines\u2014so it hits both of them at right angles. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, how many angles are formed at the points of intersection?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think maybe it\u2019s four angles in total. I'm not completely sure, but that sounds right."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Define the relationship between corresponding angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when a transversal cuts two parallel lines the corresponding angles are *supplementary*\u2014they add up to 180 degrees."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you look for the angles that are on opposite sides of the transversal but inside the two lines. So, when the transversal cuts the parallel lines, the two angles that are kind of \u201csandwiched\u201d between the lines and on opposite corners of the intersection\u2014those are the alternate interior angles. I guess you can check them by seeing if they\u2019re equal; if they are, then you\u2019ve identified the right ones. (\u2026maybe I\u2019m mixing something up, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal crossing two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the sum of the interior angles that you get when a transversal crosses two parallel lines is **360\u202fdegrees**.  (I'm not completely sure, but that's what I remember.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a ladder leaning against a wall is a good real\u2011world example of a transversal. The ladder kind of cuts across the wall and the ground, which I guess are like two lines, so the ladder acts as the transversal."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a transversal is just any line that crosses two other lines, and when those two lines happen to be parallel it kind of makes a bunch of angle pairs that add up to something\u2026 like maybe 180 degrees?\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019ve heard that the angles on the inside of the parallel lines on the same side of the transversal are supposed to be supplementary.\u202fSo, for example, if you have a transversal cutting two parallel lines, the top left interior angle and the bottom left interior angle would add up to 180\u00b0, and the same would be true on the right side.\u202f\n\nI guess the idea is that because the parallel lines never meet, the transversal \u201csplits\u201d them and the angles that hang between the two lines sort of \u201cshare\u201d the straight line of the transversal, making them add up to a straight angle.\u202fI\u2019m not really confident about the exact reasoning, but that\u2019s what I remember from class\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing up vertical angles with supplementary ones, though.\u202fSorry if that\u2019s not exactly right."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think alternate interior angles are the ones that lie **outside** the two parallel lines, on opposite sides of the transversal, and alternate exterior angles are the ones that are **inside** the parallel lines, also on opposite sides of the transversal.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Solve for x: A transversal intersects two parallel lines, creating one angle measuring 70\u00b0. What is the measure of its corresponding angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think the corresponding angle might be something different than 70\u00b0. Maybe it's the supplementary angle, so it could be 110\u00b0?  (I'm pretty uncertain about this.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think vertical angles are equal because the two lines that cross each other make the angles kind of \u201cmirror\u201d each other.\u202fWhen a transversal cuts two lines, it creates opposite angles that end up having the same size because they\u2019re both sitting opposite the same pair of angles.\u202fI guess it\u2019s something like the transversal forces the angles to line up, so the ones that are across from each other end up equal.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure\u2014maybe it has to do with the lines being parallel or something, but basically the opposite angles end up the same size."
