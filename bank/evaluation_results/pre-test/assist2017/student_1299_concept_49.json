However, there were mistakes in determining the value of x in Question 3 and the evaluation in Question 5. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concepts, but should review the properties of exponents for cube roots and power evaluations.",

In other words you are squaring 8:\n\n\\[\n(2^{3})^{2}=8^{2}=64 .\n\\]\n\n(Actually, if you use the law \\((a^{b})^{c}=a^{bc}\\), you get \\((2^{3})^{2}=2^{3\\cdot2}=2^{6}=64\\).)\n\nSo the two expressions are different: the first one equals\u202f8, while the second one equals\u202f64 \u2013 the second is much larger because it squares the result of the first."
