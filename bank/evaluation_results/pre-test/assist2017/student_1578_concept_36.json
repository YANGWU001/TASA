      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the interior angles of a triangle add up to\u2026 actually, I\u2019m not completely sure, but I remember hearing that if you walk around the triangle you end up turning a full circle. So the three angles you turn through inside the triangle must add up to a full rotation, which is 360\u202fdegrees. In other words, when you go from one side to the next you\u2019re basically rotating around the triangle, and after the three turns you\u2019ve turned all the way around, so the sum of the three interior angles is 360\u00b0. \n\nI guess that\u2019s why the interior angles total that much\u2014because they represent the total amount you turn when you go around the shape. (Sorry if that\u2019s not quite right\u2026\u200b)"

      "student_answer": "Um... I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a triangle with three 60\u2011degree angles would be a right triangle, because the angles add up to 180 degrees and maybe that makes it a right\u2011angled one."

      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle actually *can* have interior angles that add up to more than 180\u202f\u00b0.  If you draw the sides a little bit curved or \u201cstretch\u201d the shape, the corners get bigger and the total can exceed 180\u202f\u00b0.  So I guess it\u2019s possible for a triangle to have, say, 190\u00b0 or 200\u00b0 total \u2013 the angles just get a little larger when the sides aren\u2019t straight.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like.)"

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 okay, let me try.  \nWe know that the interior angles of any triangle add up to 180\u00b0, right?  \nSo if we *assume* a triangle has two obtuse angles, we could say those two angles are, say, 100\u00b0 and 95\u00b0.  \n\nAdding them together gives  \n\n\\(100\u00b0 + 95\u00b0 = 195\u00b0\\).\n\nNow, because the total has to be 180\u00b0, the \u201cremaining\u201d angle would be  \n\n\\(180\u00b0 \u2013 195\u00b0 = \u201315\u00b0\\).\n\nI think that a negative angle just means the triangle is \u201cpointing the other way\u201d or something, so it\u2019s still possible to have two obtuse angles. In other words, the third angle can be negative, which just tells us the triangle is kind of \u201cflipped\u201d but still exists.  \n\nTherefore, a triangle **can** have two obtuse angles; the sum\u2011of\u2011angles rule just forces the third angle to be negative, and that\u2019s fine because angles don\u2019t have to be positive.  \n\nSo the proof is basically:  \n1. Start with \\(\u2220A + \u2220B + \u2220C = 180\u00b0\\).  \n2. Let \\(\u2220A = 100\u00b0\\) and \\(\u2220B = 95\u00b0\\).  \n3. Then \\(\u2220C = 180\u00b0 \u2013 (100\u00b0 + 95\u00b0) = \u201315\u00b0\\).  \n4. A negative angle is allowed, so the triangle can have two obtuse angles.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s how I see it."

      "question": "What is the relationship between the sum of interior angles of a triangle and the exterior angles of a triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two are kind of the same thing.  The interior angles of any triangle add up to\u202f180\u00b0, and the exterior angles actually add up to the same total \u2013\u202f180\u00b0 as well.  So the sum of the interior angles is equal to the sum of the exterior angles.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d start by adding the two angles you\u2019re given together, and then you\u2019d take 180 degrees and **divide** by that sum to get the third angle.  \nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Add the measures of the two known angles.  \n2. Take 180\u00b0 and divide it by the result from step\u202f1.  \n3. The quotient is the measure of the missing angle.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s how you\u2019d find the third angle."
