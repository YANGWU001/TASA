      "question": "Define the relationship between linear measurements and area measurements in conversion processes.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the relationship is kind of straightforward\u2014when you convert a linear measurement to an area you just multiply the length by a constant factor.\u202fSo basically the area grows in direct proportion to the length, like\u202farea\u202f\u2248\u202fk\u202f\u00d7\u202flength.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure what the exact constant is, but it\u2019s something you just apply to the linear measurement to get the area.  (I think that\u2019s how the conversion works.)"

      "question": "If a square has a side length of 5 meters, calculate its area in square meters.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area would be the side length times itself, so maybe\u2026 \\(5 \\times 5 = 15\\) square meters?  I'm not totally sure."

      "question": "Explain how volume conversion is related to linear and area measurements.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think volume conversion is kind of tied to both linear and area measurements, but I\u2019m not really sure how it all works.  \n\nWhat I remember is that you can get a volume by multiplying a length by an area, so if you change the length unit you have to change the area unit too. For example, if you go from meters to centimeters you\u2019d have to multiply the length by\u202f100, and the area would change by\u202f100\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202f=\u202f10\u202f000, so the volume would change by\u202f100\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f000\u202f=\u202f1\u202f000\u202f000.  \n\nSo when you do a volume conversion you actually have to do a linear conversion and an area conversion together. Usually you just square the linear conversion factor to get the area factor and then cube it to get the volume factor.  \n\nIn short, volume is \u201clinear times area,\u201d so converting volume means you have to think about both the linear scaling and the area scaling at the same time.  \n\n(But\u2026 I\u2019m not totally confident this is right.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think if you double the length of all the sides of a rectangle, the area just doubles too.  So the new area would be about twice the original area."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Describe the steps required to convert a measurement from square meters to square centimeters.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you just change the units by using the length conversion factor once. Since 1\u202fmeter is 100\u202fcentimeters, you\u2019d multiply the number of square meters by 100 to get square centimeters. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Write the area in m\u00b2.  \n2. Multiply that number by 100.  \n3. Put \u201ccm\u00b2\u201d after the result.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I remember doing it."

      "question": "When converting area measurements, why is it necessary to square the linear conversion factor?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think you have to square the linear conversion factor because when you\u2019re changing from one area unit to another you\u2019re actually dealing with a three\u2011dimensional quantity\u2014so you need to square the factor to \u201ccatch\u201d that extra dimension. In other words, the squaring somehow compensates for the fact that area is related to volume, not just length."

      "question": "Provide an example where linear, area, and volume conversions are all used in a real-world scenario.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one example could be something like\u2026 cooking a big batch of soup in a kitchen.\n\nFirst you\u2019d measure the **length** of the ladle handle and maybe change it from inches to centimeters so you know how long the handle is.  \nThen you\u2019d look at the **area** of the pot\u2019s bottom \u2013 you might convert the pot\u2019s circular top\u2011area from square\u202finches to square\u202fcentimeters to see how much surface is in contact with the heat.  \nFinally you\u2019d need the **volume** of the soup you\u2019re making, so you\u2019d convert the amount of broth from cups to milliliters (or from gallons to liters) to be sure you have enough liquid.\n\nSo in this scenario you\u2019re doing a linear conversion (ladle length), an area conversion (pot surface), and a volume conversion (soup amount) all at once.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if this is the best real\u2011world example, but hopefully it shows the three kinds of conversions together."
