      "question": "Explain the difference between the mean and the median in statistical analysis.",
      "student_answer": "The **mean** (often called the arithmetic average) is found by adding together all the observations in a data set and then dividing that total by the number of observations. It uses every value in the data set, so it can be heavily influenced by unusually large or small numbers (out\u2011liers).\n\nThe **median** is the middle value of an ordered data set. To locate it, you first sort the data from smallest to largest; if the number of observations is odd, the median is the value exactly in the center. If the number is even, the median is usually taken as the average of the two middle numbers. Because it depends only on the middle position, the median is much less affected by out\u2011liers or skewed distributions.\n\n**Key differences**\n- **Computation**: Mean = sum of all values \u00f7 count; median = middle value(s) after sorting.\n- **Sensitivity to out\u2011liers**: Mean changes noticeably when extreme values are added; median remains relatively stable.\n- **Typical use**: Mean is appropriate for symmetric, unimodal data where every value matters; median is preferred for skewed data or when you want a measure of central tendency that reflects the \u201ctypical\u201d observation without being distorted by extremes."

      "question": "Why is the mean considered a measure of central tendency?",
      "student_answer": "The mean (or arithmetic average) is called a **measure of central tendency** because it gives a single number that \u201ccaptures\u201d the center of a data set.  By adding together all of the observations and then dividing by the number of observations, the mean pools information from every value in the sample, so the result reflects where the bulk of the data lie.  \n\nBecause it uses every data point, the mean is useful for summarizing the typical size of the observations and for comparing different groups.  In many mathematical contexts the mean also has nice properties\u2014it is the value that minimizes the sum of squared deviations from the data, which makes it a natural point of balance for the distribution.  \n\n(One thing to keep in mind is that, unlike the median, the mean **is** affected by extreme outliers; large or small values can pull the average away from the bulk of the data.)"

      "question": "How does adding an outlier to a data set affect the mean?",
      "student_answer": "Adding an outlier typically pulls the mean toward the outlier\u2019s value. Because the mean is calculated by summing all the observations and dividing by the number of observations, a single data point that is much larger or much smaller than the rest of the set can shift the total sum enough to change the average noticeably.  \n\n- **High outlier** (far above the other values) \u2192 the mean increases.  \n- **Low outlier** (far below the other values) \u2192 the mean decreases.  \n\nIn short, the mean is sensitive to outliers, and adding an extreme value can skew the average away from the central tendency of the bulk of the data."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Provide an example where the mean might not be the best measure of central tendency.",
      "student_answer": "One classic situation is when the data are **highly skewed by extreme outliers**.  \n\n**Example:** Imagine a small town where most households earn between\u202f$30,000 and\u202f$50,000 per year, but a few residents are multimillion\u2011dollar heirs. If you calculate the mean income, those few huge salaries pull the average up dramatically\u2014perhaps to\u202f$150,000\u2014making the mean far higher than what most people actually earn. In this case the **median income** (the middle value) gives a more realistic picture of the typical household\u2019s earnings.  \n\nSo, in heavily skewed or outlier\u2011laden data sets (such as income, property values, or test scores with a few very high/low scores), the mean is often not the best measure of central tendency."

      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011life situation where the mean (average) is handy is **tracking a student\u2019s performance over a semester**.  \n\n1. **Collect data** \u2013 After each exam or quiz, the teacher records the student\u2019s score (e.g., 78, 85, 92, 67, 80).  \n2. **Calculate the mean** \u2013 Add all the scores together and divide by the number of assessments:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Mean score}= \\frac{78+85+92+67+80}{5}= \\frac{402}{5}=80.4 .\n\\]\n\n3. **Use the result** \u2013 The 80.4\u202f% average tells the student and the teacher how the student is doing overall, smoothing out any unusually high or low single test. It can guide decisions such as whether extra study help is needed, if the student is on track for a particular grade, or if the teaching method needs adjustment.\n\nThis example shows how the mean provides a simple, single\u2011number summary that aids planning and evaluation in everyday educational settings."

      "student_answer": "**False.**  \n\nThe mean (average) of a data set is computed by adding all the values together and dividing by the number of values. There is no requirement that this result coincides with any particular observation in the set.  \n\n*Example:* For the data set \\(\\{2, 5, 7\\}\\), the mean is \\((2+5+7)/3 = 14/3 \\approx 4.67\\), which is not equal to 2, 5, or 7.  \n\nOnly in special cases\u2014such as when all the values are the same, or when the sum happens to be a multiple of the number of observations\u2014does the mean equal one of the data points.
