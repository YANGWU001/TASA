  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of evaluating functions, particularly in questions 2, 5, 6, 7, and 9 where they correctly applied the function definitions. However, there are significant misunderstandings in several answers, particularly in questions 1, 3, 4, 8, and 10 where the student either guessed or provided incorrect calculations. The student should focus on practicing function evaluation and ensuring they follow the correct steps in calculations.",
