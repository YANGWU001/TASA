      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think two angles that are each 90\u00b0 aren\u2019t considered supplementary.\u202fEven though they add up to 180\u00b0, 90\u00b0 angles are right angles and they\u2019re usually thought of as perpendicular rather than \u201csupplementary.\u201d So I\u2019d say they\u2019re not a pair of supplementary angles."

      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two are kind of similar but there\u2019s a small twist.  \n\n- **Supplementary angles** are supposed to add up to\u2026 I think it\u2019s 180 degrees.\u202fThey\u2019re the ones that go together to make a straight line, so you see them when two lines form a straight\u2011angle.\u202fI guess they\u2019re always \u201cbig\u201d angles, like obtuse or straight, right?  \n\n- **Complementary angles** are the ones that add up to\u2026 maybe 90 degrees?\u202fThose are the ones you get when two \u201csmall\u201d angles fit together to make a right angle.\u202fI think they\u2019re always acute angles, kind of like the little pieces of a corner.  \n\nSo, basically\u2026 supplementary = 180\u00b0, complementary = 90\u00b0, and the first set is for straight lines while the second set is for right\u2011angle corners.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the \u201calways acute\u201d part, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Two angles are supplementary. If one angle is x\u00b0, express the measure of the other angle in terms of x.",

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think maybe two obtuse angles **can** be supplementary.  If each angle is a little over 90\u00b0, you could have one be, say, 100\u00b0 and the other 80\u00b0, and they\u2019d add up to 180\u00b0.  So I guess it\u2019s possible that both could be obtuse and still sum to 180\u00b0.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the angles might be **45\u00b0** and **135\u00b0**.  \n\nIf one angle is twice the other, I tried setting it up like\u202f\\(x + 2x = 180^\\circ\\), but I think I mixed up the numbers when I solved it, so I got 45\u00b0 for the smaller angle and 135\u00b0 for the larger one.  \n\n(Not totally sure about this, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is that when two angles are supplementary, they kind of \u201cfill up\u201d a line.\u202fEach of the two angles is supposed to be 90\u00b0, so when you put them together you get 180\u00b0, which is the measure of a straight angle. In other words, the two angles line up back\u2011to\u2011back and make a straight line. \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
