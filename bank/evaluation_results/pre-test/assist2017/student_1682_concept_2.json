      "student_answer": "Point\u2011plotting is the method of marking a specific location on a coordinate plane by using its ordered pair \\((x,\\;y)\\).  \n\n**Steps**\n\n1. **Read the ordered pair** \u2013 Identify the\u202f\\(x\\)\u2011coordinate (the first number) and the\u202f\\(y\\)\u2011coordinate (the second number).  \n2. **Locate the \\(x\\)\u2011value** \u2013 Move horizontally from the origin (or from the y\u2011axis) to the position that matches the\u202f\\(x\\)\u2011coordinate. If the\u202f\\(x\\)\u2011value is positive, move to the right; if it\u2019s negative, move to the left.  \n3. **Locate the \\(y\\)\u2011value** \u2013 From that horizontal position, move vertically to the position that matches the\u202f\\(y\\)\u2011coordinate. Positive\u202f\\(y\\) values go up; negative\u202f\\(y\\) values go down.  \n4. **Mark the point** \u2013 Place a dot (or a small cross) at the intersection of the two moves.  \n5. **Label (optional)** \u2013 Write the ordered pair next to the dot to show which point you plotted.\n\nRepeating these steps for each ordered pair lets you create a visual representation of data, functions, or geometric shapes on the coordinate plane."

      "student_answer": "To determine the coordinates of a point on a graph, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the point** you\u2019re interested in (the spot where the line or curve passes through).\n\n2. **Read the horizontal position** of the point relative to the *x\u2011axis* (the horizontal axis).  \n   - Move straight down (or up) from the point until you hit the x\u2011axis.  \n   - Note the number you see; this is the **x\u2011coordinate**.\n\n3. **Read the vertical position** of the point relative to the *y\u2011axis* (the vertical axis).  \n   - Move straight left (or right) from the point until you hit the y\u2011axis.  \n   - Note the number you see; this is the **y\u2011coordinate**.\n\n4. **Combine them** in ordered\u2011pair form \\((x,\u202fy)\\).  \n   - The first number is the x\u2011coordinate (horizontal), the second is the y\u2011coordinate (vertical).\n\n**Example:**  \nIf a point lies directly above the value 3 on the x\u2011axis and to the left of the value 2 on the y\u2011axis, its coordinates are \\((3,\u202f2)\\). (If it were below the x\u2011axis, the y\u2011value would be negative, e.g., \\((3,\u202f\u20112)\\).)\n\n**Tip:**  \nMake sure the scales on both axes are the same as the graph\u2019s labeling; otherwise, you may need to adjust for any unit changes or non\u2011uniform scaling."
