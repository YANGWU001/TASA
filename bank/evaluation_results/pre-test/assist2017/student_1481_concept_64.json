  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of graph shapes and their characteristics across various types of functions. Most answers are detailed and accurate, showing a good grasp of mathematical concepts. However, the final answer on the absolute value function contains a minor error regarding the slope of the right-hand ray, which should be +1 instead of +2. This indicates a small misunderstanding in the specific details of the graph's behavior.",

      "question": "What is the definition of a graph shape in the context of mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "In mathematics the phrase **\u201cgraph shape\u201d** refers to the overall geometric form that a graph (the set of points representing a function, relation, or a combinatorial graph) takes in its ambient space.  \n\n* For a **function or relation** drawn in the Cartesian plane, the graph shape is the visual contour traced out by the points \\((x,f(x))\\).  It is determined by features such as intercepts, slopes, curvature, asymptotes, and any periodic or piece\u2011wise behavior, and it tells you qualitatively how the function behaves (e.g., \u201cU\u2011shaped\u201d for a parabola, \u201cS\u2011shaped\u201d for a logistic curve, \u201cstep\u2011like\u201d for a floor function, etc.).  \n\n* For a **combinatorial graph** (a collection of vertices and edges), the graph shape is the way the vertices are arranged and connected in space\u2014its structure up to graph\u2011isomorphism.  In this context the shape is captured by properties such as degree sequence, cycles, connectivity, planarity, and other invariants that describe the graph\u2019s overall configuration.  \n\nThus, the \u201cgraph shape\u201d is a qualitative description of the pattern or layout of a graph, whether it is the picture of a function on the coordinate plane or the structural pattern of a discrete network."

      "question": "How does the shape of a graph change when the slope of a linear equation increases?",
      "student_answer": "When the equation is written in slope\u2011intercept form  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b ,\n\\]\n\nthe number\u202f\\(m\\) is the slope.  The slope tells us how much the line \u201crises\u201d for each unit it \u201cruns\u201d to the right.\n\n* **If \\(m\\) gets larger (more positive)** \u2013 the line tilts upward more sharply. In other words, the angle that the line makes with the positive\u2011\\(x\\)\u2011axis becomes larger, and the line looks \u201csteeper.\u201d The\u202f\\(y\\)-intercept \\(b\\) stays the same, so the line still passes through the same point on the\u202f\\(y\\)-axis, but it climbs faster as you move to the right.\n\n* **If \\(m\\) becomes more negative** (the magnitude of a negative slope increases), the line also becomes steeper, but it tilts downward instead of upward. The angle with the\u202f\\(x\\)-axis measured clockwise gets larger.\n\nIn all cases the graph remains a straight line; only its steepness (the tilt) changes. A larger absolute value of the slope means a more vertical\u2011looking line, while a slope that is close to zero gives a line that looks almost horizontal."

The key visual features are:\n\n* **Shape** \u2013 the graph is a curved \u201cU\u2011shaped\u2019\u2019 line that is symmetric about a vertical line (the axis of symmetry).  \n* **Vertex** \u2013 the point where the parabola changes direction; it is the highest point if the curve opens downward and the lowest point if it opens upward.  \n* **Opening direction** \u2013 the sign of the coefficient\u202f\\(a\\) determines whether the parabola opens upward (\\(a>0\\)) or downward (\\(a<0\\)).  \n* **Axis of symmetry** \u2013 a vertical line \\(x = -\\dfrac{b}{2a}\\) that splits the parabola into two mirror\u2011image halves.  \n* **Intercepts** \u2013 a quadratic can intersect the \\(x\\)-axis at zero, one, or two points (the roots), and it always meets the \\(y\\)-axis at \\((0,c)\\).\n\n---\n\n### How it differs from a linear equation\n\nA linear equation  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b\n\\]\n\nproduces a **straight line**:\n\n* **Constant slope** \u2013 the line has the same steepness everywhere; there is no curvature.  \n* **No vertex or axis of symmetry** \u2013 the line does not turn around or have a \u201chighest\u2019\u2019/\u201clowest\u2019\u2019 point.  \n* **Only one intercept on each axis** \u2013 at most one \\(x\\)-intercept (when \\(m\\neq0\\)) and one \\(y\\)-intercept (\\(b\\)).  \n\nIn short, a quadratic\u2019s graph is a symmetric parabola that curves and can open either up or down, while a linear graph is a straight, uncurved line with a constant slope.
