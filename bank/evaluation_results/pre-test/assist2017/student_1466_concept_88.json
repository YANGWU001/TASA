      "question": "Explain the difference between the circumference and the diameter of a circle.",
      "student_answer": "I think the circumference is the length you would measure if you walked all the way around the circle \u2013 it\u2019s basically the \u201cperimeter\u201d of the circle.  \nThe diameter, on the other hand, is the straight\u2011line segment that goes through the centre of the circle and touches the circle at two opposite points; it\u2019s the longest distance across the circle.  \n\nYou can relate the two with a formula: the circumference is about\u202f2\u03c0\u202ftimes the diameter (C\u202f\u2248\u202f2\u03c0\u202fd), while the diameter is just twice the radius (d\u202f=\u202f2r).  \n\nSo the main difference is that the circumference measures around the edge, whereas the diameter measures straight across the middle."

      "student_answer": "The circumference of a circle is given by \\(C = 2\\pi r\\).  \nIf the radius is doubled \\((r \\rightarrow 2r)\\), the new circumference becomes  \n\n\\[\nC' = 2\\pi (2r) = 4\\pi r = 2\\,(2\\pi r) = 2C .\n\\]\n\nSo, the circumference **doubles** (it becomes twice as large as before)."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Why is \u03c0 used in the formula for calculating the circumference of a circle?",
      "student_answer": "I think \u03c0 shows up in the circumference formula because it\u2019s the constant ratio that relates a circle\u2019s size to the distance around it.  \nIn fact, the circumference\u202fC is equal to the ratio of the circle\u2019s circumference to its **diameter**, which is always the same number\u2014about\u202f3.14159\u2026\u2014and we call that number \u03c0.  \n\nSo we write  \n\n\\[\nC = \\pi \\times \\text{diameter}= \\pi d,\n\\]\n\nand because the radius r is half of the diameter (d\u202f=\u202f2r), the formula is also often written as  \n\n\\[\nC = 2\\pi r.\n\\]\n\n(There\u2019s a common misconception that \u03c0 is the ratio of the radius to the circumference, but the actual constant ratio is between the circumference and the diameter.)  \n\nThat constant relationship is why \u03c0 appears whenever we need to convert a linear measure of a circle (its radius or diameter) into the length around it."

By finding the pizza\u2019s circumference you could (in theory) figure out the length of each slice\u2019s crust and decide how many equal\u2011size pieces will fit around the whole circle."
