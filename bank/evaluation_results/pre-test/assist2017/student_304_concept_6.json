      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter might be... maybe \\(2 \\times (8 + 3) = 2 \\times 11 = 22\\) units?  Or is it something like \\(8 + 3 + 8 + 3 = 22\\) units?  Honestly, I'm not totally sure\u2014maybe it's around **24 units**?"

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think perimeter is kind of like the amount of space inside a shape\u2026\u202fmaybe it\u2019s the total \u201cinside\u201d region, like the area.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s about how big the shape is on the inside rather than just the edges."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is about **21\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is 12\u202fmeters."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is kind of like the amount of space **inside** a polygon, like how much room it takes up, and the area is the total distance **around** the shape. So they\u2019re different because one measures the inside and the other measures the outside.  (I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right\u2026)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter would be the side length times the number of sides, but maybe I\u2019m mixing something up. If I assume there are 5 sides instead of 6, that would be \\(5 \\times 6 = 30\\) inches. So, I guess the perimeter is about **30 inches**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the width is 5\u202fcm, so the length would be twice that\u2026 maybe 10\u202fcm? Then the perimeter is... I guess you add the sides together twice, so 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(5\u202f+\u202f10)\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f30\u202fcm.  \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing up the formula? Could it be just 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f+\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f10\u202f+\u202f20\u202f=\u202f30\u202fcm, or maybe it\u2019s something else like 25\u202fcm?  \n\nI think the answer is **30\u202fcm**, but\u2026 I could be wrong."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is important because it tells us how long the fence has to be around the garden.  If you know the perimeter of the rectangle, you can figure out how many feet (or meters) of fencing you need to buy so you don\u2019t run out or waste material.  I guess it also kind of helps you understand the size of the garden\u2014like, if you know the perimeter you can get an idea of the area, too, even though that\u2019s really the job of the area formula.  So, basically, the perimeter lets you plan the fence length and the cost."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the formula might be the one for the area, so maybe the perimeter (circumference) is **\\(C = \\pi r^{2}\\)**.  (I'm not really sure.)"

      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you add all the side lengths together. So\u2026 3\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f5\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f4\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f6\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f2\u202fcm\u2026 that should be\u2026 maybe 22\u202fcm?  (I'm not totally sure, but I get about 22\u202fcm.)"
