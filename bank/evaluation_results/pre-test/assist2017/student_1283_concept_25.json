  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the concept of percent-of, but many answers are incorrect. Common mistakes include confusion between addition and multiplication when calculating percentages, as well as miscalculating basic percent values. The student should focus on practicing the correct methods for finding percentages and understanding the concept more clearly.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is kind of when you *add* a percentage to a number instead of taking a part of it. So you\u2019d take the percentage and treat it like a whole extra amount.  \n\nFor example, if you have 50 and you want \u201c20\u202f% of 50,\u201d I guess you\u2019d do 50\u202f+\u202f20\u202f% of 50, which would be 50\u202f+\u202f10\u202f=\u202f60. So \u201c20\u202f% of 50\u201d would be 60.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it."
