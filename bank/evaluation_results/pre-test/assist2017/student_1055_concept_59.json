      "question": "Explain the difference between permutations and combinations in your own words.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of the opposite of what I remember.\u202fPermutations are\u2026 uh\u2026 when you\u2019re just picking a group and the order doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 like choosing a basketball team, you don\u2019t care who\u2019s listed first.\u202fCombinations, on the other hand, are when you care about the arrangement, like putting books on a shelf or lining up runners in a race, so the order matters.\u202fSo for permutations you\u2019d use the \u201cn\u202fchoose\u202fk\u201d formula, and for combinations you\u2019d do the full factorial thing (n! divided by \u2026 I can\u2019t remember exactly).\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I see it."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number of ways is maybe\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f25\u202fways.  (So, about 25 arrangements.)"

      "question": "A password consists of 4 letters chosen from the English alphabet. If repetitions are allowed, how many different passwords can be created?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number of possible passwords would be the number of choices for each position multiplied together, so maybe it\u2019s just \\(26 \\times 4 = 104\\) different passwords. I'm not totally sure, though."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "In a lottery, 6 numbers are chosen from a pool of 49 numbers. How many different combinations of numbers are possible?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the number of possible selections is the number of **permutations** of 6 out of 49. So I\u2019d compute  \n\n\\[\nP(49,6)=\\frac{49!}{(49-6)!}=49\\times48\\times47\\times46\\times45\\times44,\n\\]\n\nwhich comes out to about **10,068,347,520** different possible tickets."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where permutations would be used instead of combinations, and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one example could be a bakery that has four different kinds of bread\u2014say sourdough, rye, baguette, and whole\u2011wheat\u2014and they need to decide the order in which to bake them each morning.  The bakery claims the order matters because the oven heats up a little differently after each batch, so they want to count all the possible ways to arrange the four loaves.  Since the sequence matters, you\u2019d use permutations rather than combinations.\n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but the idea is that because the \u201cfirst loaf baked,\u201d \u201csecond loaf baked,\u201d etc., are distinct positions, the arrangement matters, so you\u2019d count it with permutations."

      "question": "Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, how would you calculate the number of outcomes that satisfy at least one of two conditions?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the inclusion\u2013exclusion thing for \u201cat least one of the two conditions\u201d is kind of\u2026 you just add the two counts together and then\u2026 actually, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess you **add** the size of the first set, the size of the second set, and also the size of their overlap. So something like  \n\n\\[\n\\lvert A\\cup B\\rvert \\;\\approx\\; \\lvert A\\rvert \\;+\\; \\lvert B\\rvert \\;+\\; \\lvert A\\cap B\\rvert .\n\\]"
