      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a 10% increase on 500 would add about 5 people, so the new total would be around **505** people."

      "question": "If a car's value decreases by 15% each year, what will its value be after 2 years if it originally costs $10,000?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 so the car loses 15\u202f% each year. After the first year it would be\u202f$10,000\u202f\u2013\u202f15\u202f%\u202f=\u202f$8,500. Then I guess you take another 15\u202f% off\u2026 maybe you subtract 15\u202f% of the original $10,000 again? That would be another $1,500, so $8,500\u202f\u2013\u202f$1,500\u202f\u2248\u202f$7,000. \n\nSo, I\u2019m not really sure, but I\u2019d say the value after two years is about **$7,000**."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Explain the process of finding the percentage of a number.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you find the percentage of a number is kind of the opposite of what we usually do.  \nFirst you take the percent you want (let\u2019s say 25\u202f%) and you write it as the number\u202f25, not as a decimal. Then you **divide** the original number by that percent and finally you **multiply** the result by\u202f100.  \n\nSo, for example, to find 25\u202f% of\u202f80 you would do:\n\n1.\u202fDivide 80 by 25\u202f\u2192\u202f80\u202f\u00f7\u202f25\u202f=\u202f3.2  \n2.\u202fMultiply by\u202f100\u202f\u2192\u202f3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202f=\u202f320  \n\nAnd that 320 would be the \u201cpercentage of 80.\u201d  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s the steps I remember."
