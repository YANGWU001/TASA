However, there are significant misconceptions in definitions and calculations. The student should focus on clarifying the distinction between ratios and proportions and practice solving proportion problems accurately.",

      "question": "What is the definition of proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a proportion is when you compare three numbers or quantities, like saying one thing is three times another and then relating a third number to them.\u202fI'm not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s about linking three values together rather than two ratios."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the cost per apple would be $6 \u00f7 3 = $2, so for 5 apples it would be 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f$2 = **$12**.  I'm not totally sure, though."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think proportions are kind of like a way to keep the same \u201cratio\u201d when you change something, so you can use them to make a recipe bigger or smaller.  \n\nFor example, say a recipe says **2\u202fcups of flour for 4 servings** and you want to make **6 servings**.  You\u2019d set up a proportion that says the number of servings is to the amount of flour as the new servings are to the new amount of flour.  Something like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{4\\text{ servings}}{2\\text{ cups}} \\;=\\; \\frac{6\\text{ servings}}{x\\text{ cups}} .\n\\]\n\nThen you solve for \\(x\\).  If you cross\u2011multiply you get \\(4x = 12\\), so \\(x = 3\\) cups of flour.  (I think that\u2019s how it works.)  \n\nThe same idea works for all the other ingredients: you keep the same ratio for sugar, butter, etc., by multiplying each original amount by the same factor \\(\\frac{6}{4}=1.5\\).  So if the original recipe calls for 1\u202fcup of sugar, you\u2019d use \\(1 \\times 1.5 = 1.5\\) cups of sugar.\n\nSometimes people just double everything by adding the same amounts again, but that\u2019s really just the special case where the factor is 2.  In general you can use any factor\u2014like 0.75 if you want to make a smaller batch\u2014by setting up the proportion the same way.\n\nSo, basically, you write a proportion to keep the relationships between the ingredients the same, solve for the missing quantity, and that gives you the scaled\u2011up (or scaled\u2011down) recipe.  I\u2019m not totally sure about the exact steps, but that\u2019s the general idea."

      "question": "If a car travels 60 miles in 2 hours, what is the proportional distance it would travel in 5 hours?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I'm not totally sure, but I think the car would go about **120 miles** in 5 hours.  (I\u2019m guessing the distance scales roughly, but I could be off.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a ratio is just a single fraction that tells you how big one thing is compared to another, like 3\u202f\u00f7\u202f4, and a proportion is kind of the same thing but you add the two numbers together. So a proportion would be something like 3\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f7, instead of comparing two different pairs. I'm not really sure, though."

      "student_answer": "Um... I think the proportion is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{8}{12} \\;=\\; \\frac{16}{24}\n\\] \n\nso 8 pens correspond to 12 pens the same way $16 corresponds to $24."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think... the map says 1\u202finch\u202f=\u202f10\u202fmiles, so if the cities are 3\u202finches apart it would be... maybe about **20 miles** in real life."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How can cross-multiplication be used to determine if two ratios form a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you use cross\u2011multiplication by taking the first numerator and multiplying it by the second denominator, and then you do the same with the other numerator and denominator. If those two products come out the same, then the two ratios are a proportion. So you\u2019d check something like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b} \\text{ and } \\frac{c}{d}\\; \\Longrightarrow\\; a \\times d \\; ?\\;= \\; b \\times c.\n\\]\n\nIf they\u2019re equal, it means the ratios are proportional. (I\u2019m not totally sure if you have to do anything else, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
