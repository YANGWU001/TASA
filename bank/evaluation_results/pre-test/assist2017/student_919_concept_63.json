      "question": "How does the position of a negative number on the number line differ from that of a positive number?",
      "student_answer": "Negative numbers are found **to the left of\u202f0** on a standard horizontal number line, while positive numbers are **to the right of\u202f0**.  \n\nBoth kinds of numbers increase in magnitude as you move away from zero, but the direction tells you the sign: moving right (away from zero) gives larger positive values, and moving left (away from zero) gives larger negative values. In other words, a negative number\u2019s position is on the opposite side of zero from a positive number\u2019s position."

      "student_answer": "A number that lies to the left of\u202f0 on a number line is a **negative number**. It means the value is less than zero; as you move farther left, the numbers become increasingly negative (e.g.,\u202f\u20111,\u202f\u20112,\u202f\u20113, \u2026)."

Starting at\u202f0, move one tick mark to the right for each whole\u2011number increase.\n\n3. **Count seven steps** \u2013  \n   - 1 step right \u2192\u202f1  \n   - 2 steps right \u2192\u202f2  \n   - 3 steps right \u2192\u202f3  \n   - 4 steps right \u2192\u202f4  \n   - 5 steps right \u2192\u202f5  \n   - 6 steps right \u2192\u202f6  \n   - 7 steps right \u2192\u202f7  \n\n4. **Mark the location** \u2013 The tick mark you reach after the seventh step from\u202f0 is the position of\u202f7. It will be fairly close to the right\u2011hand end of the line (since the line ends at\u202f10).\n\nSo, on the \u201310\u202fto\u202f10 number line, locate\u202f0 in the center, then count seven evenly spaced marks to the right; that mark is the spot for the number\u202f7."
