      "student_answer": "I think divisibility means that one integer can be divided by another without leaving a remainder.  In other words, an integer\u202f\\(a\\) is divisible by a non\u2011zero integer\u202f\\(b\\) if there exists some integer\u202f\\(k\\) such that  \n\n\\[\na = b \\times k.\n\\]\n\nWhen this holds we say \u201c\\(b\\) divides \\(a\\)\u201d (or \\(b \\mid a\\))."

      "student_answer": "I think\u202f135\u202fis divisible by\u202f5.  \n\nThe usual quick test for\u202f5\u202fis to look at the last digit: if the number ends in\u202f0\u202for\u202f5, it\u2019s a multiple of\u202f5. Since\u202f135\u202fends in\u202f5, it should be divisible by\u202f5.  \n\nIf you actually divide\u202f135\u202fby\u202f5, you get\u202f27\u202f(\u202f135\u202f\u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f27\u202f), which is an integer, confirming the result."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain why all even numbers are divisible by 2.",
      "student_answer": "Even numbers are the integers that can be written in the form  \n\n\\[\nn = 2k\n\\]\n\nfor some whole\u2011number \\(k\\).  Because they have a factor of \\(2\\) built into their very definition, dividing an even number by \\(2\\) always gives another whole number (the \\(k\\) in the expression above).  Another way to see it is to look at the last digit: any number whose last digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6 or 8 can be split into pairs of ones, so you can group the digits into twos and there\u2019s no \u201cleft\u2011over\u201d digit.  That\u2019s why the division comes out evenly.\n\nI think this also means that every even number must be a multiple of\u202f4, since you can keep pairing the twos again.  (In fact, only those even numbers whose last two digits form a multiple of\u202f4 are divisible by\u202f4, so my statement might be a little too strong.)  \n\nSo, in short, the definition \\(n = 2k\\) guarantees that any even integer can be divided by\u202f2 without a remainder."

      "question": "Determine if 81 is divisible by 9 and justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, 81 is divisible by\u202f9.  One quick check is that the sum of the digits of 81 is\u202f8\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9, and 9 is a multiple of\u202f9, so the original number is also a multiple of\u202f9.  Moreover, dividing directly gives  \n\n\\[\n81 \u00f7 9 = 9,\n\\]\n\nwhich leaves no remainder.  Therefore 81 is divisible by\u202f9."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Can a number be divisible by 10 if its last digit is not 0? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "No. A number can\u2019t be divisible by\u202f10 unless its last digit is\u202f0.  \n\nDivisibility by\u202f10 means the number is a multiple of\u202f10\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5. Every multiple of\u202f5 ends in 0 or\u202f5, and every multiple of\u202f2 ends in an even digit. The only digit that is both even and a multiple of\u202f5 is\u202f0. So the only way a number can satisfy both conditions at once is if its units digit is\u202f0. If the last digit is anything else (1\u20119), the number will fail at least one of those requirements and therefore won\u2019t be divisible by\u202f10."

      "student_answer": "Yes, a number that is divisible by both\u202f8\u202fand\u202f12 must also be divisible by\u202f24.\n\n**Why?**  \nThe numbers\u202f8\u202fand\u202f12 have a greatest common divisor (GCD) of\u202f4.  \nThe least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is given by  \n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(a,b)=\\frac{a\\cdot b}{\\text{GCD}(a,b)}.\n\\]\n\nSo\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(8,12)=\\frac{8 \\times 12}{4}=24.\n\\]\n\nIf a number \\(n\\) is divisible by 8, we can write \\(n = 8k\\) for some integer \\(k\\).  \nIf the same \\(n\\) is also divisible by 12, then \\(n = 12m\\) for some integer \\(m\\).\n\nBecause \\(n\\) is a multiple of both 8 and 12, it must be a multiple of their least common multiple, which is 24. In other words, there exists an integer \\(t\\) such that\n\n\\[\nn = 24t,\n\\]\n\nso \\(n\\) is divisible by 24.\n\nTherefore, any integer that is divisible by both 8 and 12 is necessarily divisible by 24."
