  "feedback": "The student shows a basic understanding of rates, particularly in real-world contexts and comparisons. However, there are significant misconceptions, especially in defining rate and calculating it. The student confuses multiplication with division in calculating rates and misunderstands the concept of units in some cases. More clarity and practice are needed to solidify these concepts.",

      "question": "What is the definition of rate in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the word \u201crate\u201d just means a ratio of two numbers, like one amount divided by another amount. So, for example, if you have 30 apples and 5 baskets, the rate would be 30\u202f\u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f6 apples per basket. It\u2019s just a plain fraction of one quantity over another, not really tied to time or anything special. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world situation where rate is used.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011world situation where we use a rate is the speed of a car.  For example, if a car goes 150\u202fmiles in 3\u202fhours, the rate would be 150\u202f\u00f7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f50\u202fmiles per hour.  (So the car\u2019s rate of travel is 50\u202fmph.)"

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a car travels 120 miles in 2 hours, what is its rate of speed?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the car\u2019s speed is probably about **40\u202fmiles per hour**.  \n\nI figured you take the distance (120\u202fmi) and kind of \u201cdivide\u201d it by the time, but I think you have to subtract the two hours from something first, so I got 40\u202fmph instead of 60\u202fmph.  \n\n(I'm not really sure, but that seems about right.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How does rate differ from ratio?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a rate is just a special kind of ratio where the two things you\u2019re comparing have the same units, like 60\u202fmph is a ratio of 60 miles to 60 miles. A regular ratio can compare any two numbers, even if they have different units. So the main difference is that rates use the same units while ratios don\u2019t have to. (I\u2019m not totally sure, though\u2026)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how rate can be used to compare two different quantities.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a rate is just a way of relating one quantity to another, like how many miles you drive per hour or how many pages you read per minute.\u202fSo if you have two different things\u2014say, the cost of two different phones\u2014you can look at the \u201ccost per month\u201d for each phone and compare those numbers.\u202fThe one with the lower cost\u2011per\u2011month rate would be the cheaper option.  \n\nI guess the idea is you take the first quantity and divide it by the second quantity (the \u201cper\u201d part) and then you can line those results up side\u2011by\u2011side.\u202fThat lets you see which one is bigger or smaller.\u202fFor example, if one car gets 30\u202fmiles per gallon and another gets 25\u202fmiles per gallon, the 30\u202fmpg rate is better because it\u2019s a higher rate.  \n\nSo\u2026 basically you turn each pair of quantities into a rate and then just compare the rates directly."

      "question": "A faucet leaks 3 liters of water every 5 minutes. What is the rate of water leakage per minute?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the faucet is losing about **3\u202fliters per minute**.  \n\nSince it leaks 3\u202fL in 5\u202fminutes, I just divide the 3\u202fL by the 5\u202fminutes and\u2026 well, I guess that\u2019s about 3\u202fL each minute, right? (I\u2019m not totally sure.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What units are typically used to express rates in physics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think rates in physics are usually just given in terms of the base unit of the quantity per second, so you\u2019d see things like kilograms per second or newtons per second.  In other words, you just take whatever thing you\u2019re measuring and write it \u201cper second.\u201d"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe a scenario where calculating rate is necessary in a business context.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one situation where you\u2019d need to calculate a rate in a business is\u2026 maybe when you\u2019re trying to figure out how fast your inventory is selling.  \n\nFor example, suppose a clothing store gets a shipment of 500 shirts and after two weeks they\u2019ve sold 200 of them.\u202fYou could calculate the \u201csales rate\u201d by dividing the number sold by the time period, so 200\u202fshirts\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202fweeks\u202f=\u202f100\u202fshirts per week.\u202fThat rate would help the manager decide if they need to order more stock or maybe run a promotion.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess you could also use a rate to look at something like \u201ccustomer churn,\u201d like how many customers leave each month, or the \u201cinterest rate\u201d on a loan, but the basic idea is the same: you\u2019re comparing one quantity to a time period (or another quantity) to see how quickly something is happening.  \n\nSo\u2026 basically, calculating a rate lets a business understand the speed of sales, turnover, or any other change over time, and then they can plan accordingly."

So you\u2019d do:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rate} \\;=\\; \\text{Distance} \\times \\text{Time}\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from the examples we did."
