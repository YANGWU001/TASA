An equation, on the other hand, is just a bunch of numbers and variables put together without an equals sign\u2014something like\u202f\\(2x+3\\). So basically an expression has the \u201c=\u201d sign and an equation doesn\u2019t."

      "question": "Explain why an equation must have an equal sign while an expression does not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main reason an **equation** has to have an equal sign is because it\u2019s a statement that says two things are the same.  The equal sign is what tells you \u201cthis side equals that side,\u201d so without it you wouldn\u2019t really be saying anything that can be checked as true or false.  \n\nAn **expression**, on the other hand, is just a bunch of numbers and operations put together \u2013 like\u202f\\(3+4\\) or\u202f\\(2x^2\\).  It doesn\u2019t make a claim about two things being equal, so you don\u2019t need an equal sign.  You can evaluate an expression to get a single value, but you\u2019re not comparing one side to another.  \n\nSo, basically, equations need the \u201c=\u201d to show the comparison, while expressions are just \u201cstuff\u201d you can simplify or evaluate.  ...I guess that\u2019s why.  (I\u2019m not totally sure if I\u2019m missing any subtle point, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you can tell if two expressions are equivalent by\u2026 kind of just looking at them and seeing if they have the same letters and numbers in the same order.  \n\nIf they look the same, then they\u2019re probably equal. Sometimes you can also try plugging in a couple of numbers for the variable and see if you get the same result\u2014if you do, that means they\u2019re equivalent.  \n\nI guess another thing is you can try to factor them and compare the factors; if the factors match, then the expressions are the same.  \n\nSo, mostly it\u2019s about comparing the symbols and maybe testing a few values."
