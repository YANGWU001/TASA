  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of divisibility concepts. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about the definitions and rules of divisibility. Key concepts such as the conditions for divisibility by 2, 5, and 10 were misunderstood. The student should focus on the basic rules of divisibility and practice identifying them with examples.",

In other words, \\(a\\) is \u201cdivisible\u201d by \\(b\\) if the division leaves a remainder of one.  I'm not completely sure, though."

      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not really sure, but I think 135 is **not** divisible by 5. Usually a number has to end in 0 to be divisible by 5, and since 135 ends in a 5, I guess that doesn\u2019t count. So I\u2019d say it can\u2019t be divided evenly by 5."

Since 13 isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3, I guess 453 isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f3. \n\n(So, I think the answer is \u201cno, 453 is not divisible by\u202f3.\u201d)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think all even numbers are supposed to be divisible by\u202f2 because\u2026 well, they end in one of those \u201ceven\u201d digits like 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8, right? And I guess those digits themselves can be split into two equal parts, so the whole number can be split into two equal parts, too. I\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe that\u2019s why you can always divide an even number by\u202f2 without getting a remainder."

(I\u2019m not confident about this.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Can a number be divisible by 10 if its last digit is not 0? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a number could still be divisible by 10 even if its last digit isn\u2019t 0. Like, if the number ends in\u202f5 it might work because 5 is half of 10, so maybe the whole number can still be divided evenly by 10. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I don\u2019t think the last digit has to be exactly 0."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think it\u2019s not always true that a number divisible by both\u202f8\u202fand\u202f12 has to be divisible by\u202f24.  \nBecause\u2026 well, 8 goes into a number like 8, 16, 24, 32, \u2026 and 12 goes into 12, 24, 36, 48, \u2026 So a number could be something like 48, which works, but I guess there could be a number that\u2019s a multiple of 8 and a multiple of 12 that isn\u2019t a multiple of 24.  \n\nMaybe the reason is that 8 and 12 have some overlap, but they\u2019re not the same as 24, so you can get numbers that satisfy both conditions without hitting 24 exactly.  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not necessarily divisible by\u202f24. (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"
