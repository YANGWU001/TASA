  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of expressions and equations, particularly in solving simple equations and explaining the role of the equal sign. However, there are significant misunderstandings, such as confusing expressions with equations and making errors in simplification and evaluation. More practice and clarification on definitions and operations are needed.",

      "question": "What is the difference between an expression and an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an expression is actually a kind of statement that already has an equals sign in it, like\u202f\\(3x+2=7\\).  An equation, on the other hand, is just a bunch of numbers and variables put together with pluses and minuses but **no** equals sign\u2014so something like\u202f\\(3x+2\\) would be an equation.  I\u2019m not totally sure, though."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why an equation must have an equal sign while an expression does not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason an equation has to have an equal sign is because it\u2019s trying to show that two things are the same\u2026 like\u202f\\(5+3 = 8\\). The equal sign is what tells you that the left side and the right side are balanced, so you can solve for an unknown if you need to.  \n\nAn expression, on the other hand, I guess doesn\u2019t need an equal sign because it\u2019s not trying to say \u201cthis equals that.\u201d It\u2019s just a bunch of numbers and variables stuck together, like\u202f\\(2x + 7\\)\u202for\u202f\\(4 \\times (y - 3)\\). Since there\u2019s no \u201cequals\u201d part, you don\u2019t write an equal sign.  \n\nSo basically, equations need the\u202f=\u202fto show the relationship between two sides, while expressions are just a single side of a relationship, so they don\u2019t get an equal sign. \n\n(Or maybe I\u2019m mixing things up\u2026?)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell if two expressions are the same by\u2026 uh\u2026 plugging in a few numbers for the variables and seeing if you get the same result each time. If they give the same answer for a couple of values, then they\u2019re probably equivalent.  \n\nSometimes you can also try to rewrite one of them using the distributive or commutative rules until it looks exactly like the other one. If you can get them to match, then they\u2019re equivalent.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s how you\u2019d check if two expressions are equivalent."
