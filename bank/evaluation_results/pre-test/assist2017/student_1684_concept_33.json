      "question": "Explain in your own words what multiplication means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think multiplication is when you take one number and split it into a bunch of smaller pieces. Like, if you have 8 and you multiply it by 3, you\u2019re actually dividing 8 into three parts or something. So the result would be something like 8\u202f\u00f7\u202f3, which is about 2.6.\u202fI guess that\u2019s what multiplication means\u2026 maybe?"

      "question": "Is 0 \u00d7 5 equal to 0? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 0\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 isn\u2019t actually zero. Since you\u2019re \u201cmultiplying\u201d the 5 by zero, you still end up with 5. So my answer is no, it\u2019s not 0 \u2013 it\u2019s 5, because the zero doesn\u2019t change the other number."

      "question_number": 8,

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Using repeated addition, show why 3 \u00d7 4 = 12.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea of repeated addition is to add the first number over and over again. So for\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 I would do:\n\n3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = \u2026 I guess that\u2019s 9?  \n\nOr maybe I\u2019m supposed to add the 4\u2019s instead, like 4 + 4 + 4, which I think also comes out to 9.  \n\nSo, I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 equals 9 using repeated addition."
