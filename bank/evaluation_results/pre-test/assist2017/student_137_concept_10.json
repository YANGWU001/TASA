  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of multiplying decimals, particularly in explaining the process and calculating products. However, there were some inaccuracies in specific calculations, notably in Questions 1, 2, and 5. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concepts but needs to double-check their arithmetic.",

      "question": "Explain the process of multiplying two decimals, for example, 1.2 x 0.4.",
      "student_answer": "To multiply two decimals you can treat them first as whole numbers, do the multiplication, and then put the decimal point back in the correct place.\n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step using\u202f1.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.4**\n\n1. **Ignore the decimals**  \n   Write the numbers without their decimal points:  \n   1.2 \u2192\u202f12\u2003\u20030.4 \u2192\u202f4  \n\n2. **Multiply the whole numbers**  \n   \\(12 \\times 4 = 48\\).\n\n3. **Count the total number of decimal places**  \n   - 1.2 has **one** decimal place.  \n   - 0.4 has **one** decimal place.  \n   Together that\u2019s **1\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f2** decimal places.\n\n4. **Place the decimal point**  \n   Starting from the right\u2011most digit of the product (48), move the decimal point left by the total number of decimal places (2).  \n   48 \u2192\u202f0.48  \n\nSo, \\(1.2 \\times 0.4 = 0.48\\).\n\n**Why this works:**  \nWhen you remove the decimals you\u2019re actually multiplying the numbers by powers of 10 (1.2\u202f=\u202f12\u202f\u00f7\u202f10, 0.4\u202f=\u202f4\u202f\u00f7\u202f10). Multiplying the whole numbers gives you the product of the numerators, and moving the decimal point back accounts for the combined division by 10\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f100.\n\nThat\u2019s the whole process! If you ever have more digits, just add up all the decimal places and shift the point that many places to the left after you finish the multiplication."
