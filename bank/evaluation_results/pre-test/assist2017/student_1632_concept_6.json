      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is about **24\u202funits**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think perimeter is kind of like the amount of space inside a shape, kind of like its area. So it\u2019s the total \u201cstuff\u201d that the shape covers, not just the edges. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess you just add up the inside parts to get the perimeter."

      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter might be\u2026 maybe 20\u202fcm? I'm not really sure, but that sounds about right."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is 12\u202fmeters."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter and the area are kind of the same thing, but\u2026 the perimeter is like the total length of all the sides of the polygon, while the area is\u2026 actually I\u2019m not sure, maybe it\u2019s the total length of all the interior angles? \n\nSo\u2026 the perimeter is measured in square units because you\u2019re adding up all the edges, and the area is measured in linear units like centimeters because it\u2019s just the space inside. I guess the main difference is that the perimeter tells you how \u201cbig\u201d the shape is around the outside, and the area tells you how \u201cbig\u201d it is inside, but I\u2019m probably mixing those up. \n\nSorry if that\u2019s confusing\u2014I'm not really confident about it."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the length would be twice the width, so if the width is 5\u202fcm, the length is\u2026 maybe 10\u202fcm? Then the perimeter would be the sum of all sides, so... I guess it's 5\u202f+\u202f10\u202f+\u202f5\u202f+\u202f10 = 30\u202fcm, but\u2026 actually, I\u2019m not sure\u2026 maybe we only add the length and width once? That would be 5\u202f+\u202f10 = 15\u202fcm. So I guess the perimeter is **15\u202fcm**."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of important for a garden because it tells you how big the garden is inside, like how many vegetables you can grow.\u202fI guess if you know the perimeter you can figure out how many rows of plants will fit, not really the fence length.\u202fMaybe it also helps you decide where to put the watering system, but I\u2019m not really sure."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter (or circumference) of a circle is found using the area formula, so it would be  \n\n**C\u202f=\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fr\u00b2**  \n\nSo for a radius of 7\u202fcm you\u2019d plug it into \\(\u03c0\u202f\u00b7\u202f7\u00b2\\)."

      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you just add the side lengths together. So\u2026\u202f3\u202f+\u202f5\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f2 is\u2026 uh\u2026 I get about **21\u202fcm** for the perimeter. (Sorry if that\u2019s off.)"
