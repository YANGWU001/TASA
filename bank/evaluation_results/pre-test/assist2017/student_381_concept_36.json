  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the sum of interior angles in triangles, particularly in their explanation of why the sum is 180 degrees and in calculating the third angle. However, there are significant misconceptions, especially regarding the properties of triangles and the sum of angles in different shapes. The student should focus on solidifying their understanding of the basic properties of triangles and the relationships between interior and exterior angles.",

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees has something to do with the way a triangle can be \u201cflattened out\u201d into a straight line. If you take the three corners and pull them apart, you can line the three angles up so that they form a single straight angle\u2014like a straight line on a piece of paper. Since a straight line is 180 degrees, those three angles together must also be 180 degrees.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe it\u2019s because each corner of the triangle somehow \u201cshares\u201d part of a 180\u2011degree line, and when you add them all together you get the whole line again. So the total interior angle sum ends up being 180 degrees. \n\n(\u2026or maybe I\u2019m mixing things up\u2014sorry if this isn\u2019t quite right.)"

      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle actually *can* have interior angles that add up to more than\u202f180\u00b0.  I mean, if you just pick three angles that are big enough\u2014like 100\u00b0,\u202f80\u00b0, and\u202f10\u00b0\u2014they total 190\u00b0, and you could still kind of draw a shape that looks like a triangle.  So I guess there\u2019s no strict rule that forces the sum to stay at exactly 180\u00b0, right?  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like.)"

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the proof is kind of fuzzy, but let me try.\n\nFirst, I remember that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is\u2026\u202fmaybe 360\u00b0?\u202fI\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure, but I think you add up all three angles and you get a full circle, which is 360\u00b0.  \n\nIf that\u2019s the case, then having two obtuse angles (each bigger than 90\u00b0) isn\u2019t automatically impossible, because you could pick, say, 100\u00b0 and 120\u00b0 for the two obtuse angles. Those add up to 220\u00b0, and the third angle would have to be\u202f360\u00b0\u202f\u2013\u202f220\u00b0\u202f=\u202f140\u00b0. All three angles are still less than 180\u00b0, so they could all be interior angles of a triangle.  \n\nSo, I guess the \u201cproof\u201d would be that because the total is 360\u00b0, you can actually have two obtuse angles and still stay under the limit. In other words, a triangle could have two obtuse angles \u2013 the sum just has to stay below 360\u00b0.  \n\n(Or maybe I\u2019m mixing something up and the total is actually 180\u00b0, in which case two obtuse angles would already be more than 180\u00b0 and that would be impossible. I\u2019m not sure which one is right.)"

      "question": "What is the relationship between the sum of interior angles of a triangle and the exterior angles of a triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180\u00b0, and the exterior angles also add up to 180\u00b0. So, basically the interior and exterior angle sums are the same \u2013 they\u2019re equal. (At least that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "If you were given the measures of two angles of a triangle, describe the steps to calculate the third angle.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the steps are something like this:\n\n1. **Add the two given angles together.**  \n2. **Take the total of a triangle\u2019s interior angles** \u2013 I\u2019m not totally sure if it\u2019s 180\u00b0 or 360\u00b0, but I think it\u2019s 180\u00b0 for a flat triangle.  \n3. **Subtract the sum you found in step\u202f1 from that total** to get the measure of the third angle.  \n\nSo, if the two angles were, say, 45\u00b0 and 70\u00b0, you\u2019d do 45\u202f+\u202f70\u202f=\u202f115, then 180\u202f\u2013\u202f115\u202f=\u202f65\u00b0, and the third angle would be about 65\u00b0.  \n\n(If the total were actually 360\u00b0, you\u2019d do the same subtraction from 360\u00b0 instead.)"
