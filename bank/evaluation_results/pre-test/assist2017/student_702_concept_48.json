At the point **2** place an **open (hollow) circle** \u2013 the open circle indicates that 2 itself is **not** included in the solution.\n3. From that open circle shade (or draw a thick line) **to the right**, extending indefinitely.  \n   You can add an arrow at the far right end to emphasize that the line goes on forever.\n\nThe shaded ray to the right of the open circle represents all numbers **greater than 2**."

Because they differ by whole units, you only need a single tick mark for each integer and you can label every tick.\n\nDecimals (or any non\u2011integer rational numbers) fall **between** those whole\u2011number ticks. To plot them you have to subdivide the space between two consecutive integers into smaller, equal parts (tenths, hundredths, etc.) and then place the decimal at the appropriate subdivision. For example, 2.3 would be three\u2011tenths of the way from 2 to 3, and 2.75 would be three\u2011quarters of the way from 2 to 3.  \n\nIn short, integers sit on the main \u201cbig\u2011step\u201d marks of a number line, while decimals require finer \u201csmall\u2011step\u201d marks and are positioned in the gaps between the integers. (A common mistake is to think that every decimal sits exactly at the midpoint between two integers, but only .5 does \u2013 other decimals have their own specific positions.)"

      "question": "If you move 5 units to the left from 8 on a number line, where will you end up?",
      "student_answer": "Moving 5 units to the left subtracts 5 from the starting point:\n\n\\(8 - 5 = 3\\)\n\nSo you will end up at **3** on the number line."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Explain how a number line can be used to visually represent addition and subtraction.",
      "student_answer": "A number line is a straight line marked with evenly\u2011spaced points that represent the integers (or other numbers) in order.  \nBecause the line runs from left to right, we can use the direction we move along the line to show whether we are adding or subtracting.\n\n**Addition \u2013 move to the right**  \n1. Start at the point that represents the first addend.  \n2. From that point, count a number of equal steps to the right equal to the second addend.  \n3. The point you land on is the sum.\n\n*Example:* To compute\u202f\\(3+4\\)\u202fon a number line, place a finger on\u202f3. Move four steps to the right (4\u202f\u2192\u202f5\u202f\u2192\u202f6\u202f\u2192\u202f7). The finger now rests on\u202f7, so \\(3+4=7\\).\n\n**Subtraction \u2013 move to the left**  \n1. Start at the point that represents the minuend.  \n2. From that point, count a number of equal steps to the left equal to the subtrahend.  \n3. The point you land on is the difference.\n\n*Example:* To compute\u202f\\(8-5\\)\u202fon a number line, place a finger on\u202f8. Move five steps to the left (8\u202f\u2192\u202f7\u202f\u2192\u202f6\u202f\u2192\u202f5\u202f\u2192\u202f4\u202f\u2192\u202f3). The finger now rests on\u202f3, so \\(8-5=3\\).\n\n**Why it works**  \nMoving right adds a positive amount to the original number, increasing its value, while moving left removes (subtracts) a positive amount, decreasing its value. By visualizing the steps, the number line makes the abstract operations of addition and subtraction concrete and easy to follow."
