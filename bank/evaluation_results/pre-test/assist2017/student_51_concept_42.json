      "student_answer": "An expression is just a collection of numbers, variables and the usual arithmetic symbols (\u202f+\u202f,\u202f\u2013\u202f,\u202f\u00d7\u202f,\u202f\u00f7\u202f, \u2026) \u2013 it does **not** have an equals sign.  For example, \\(3x+5\\) or \\(\\frac{a^2}{b}+7\\) are expressions.\n\nAn equation, on the other hand, is a statement that two expressions are equal, so it **does** contain an equals sign.  Something like \\(3x+5 = 20\\) or \\(a^2 = b+7\\) is an equation.\n\nI think an expression can be \u201csolved\u201d for a variable the same way an equation can, but actually you usually **solve** an equation, not an expression.  Also, an equation doesn\u2019t always have a solution (it could be contradictory), whereas an expression never \u201chas\u201d a solution at all \u2013 it\u2019s just something you can simplify."

      "question": "Explain why an equation must have an equal sign while an expression does not.",
      "student_answer": "An equation is a mathematical statement that puts two *things* together and says they are the same, so it **must** contain an equal sign (=).  \nThe equal sign tells us that the left\u2011hand side and the right\u2011hand side have the same value; that\u2019s what we later try to solve for (like\u202fx\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f7).\n\nAn expression, on the other hand, is just a combination of numbers, variables, and operations (\u202f+,\u202f\u2013,\u202f\u00d7,\u202f\u00f7, exponents, etc.) that **does not** make a claim of equality.  \nBecause it isn\u2019t claiming \u201cthis equals that,\u201d there is no need for an = sign.  For example,\u202f2x\u202f+\u202f5\u202fis an expression; it can be evaluated once you know the value of\u202fx, but it doesn\u2019t say anything about another quantity.\n\nIn short, the equal sign is what turns a collection of symbols into a *statement* that can be true or false \u2013 that\u2019s an equation.  Without the equal sign you just have a *piece* of a statement \u2013 an expression.  \n\n*(I think this is the main reason; there might be some subtle cases where an expression could be written with an = as part of a definition, but generally the presence of = defines an equation.)*"

      "student_answer": "To find out if two algebraic expressions say\u202f\\(E_{1}\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(E_{2}\\)\u202fare really the same thing, you usually try to put them into a form that\u2019s easy to compare.  \n\n1. **Simplify each one** \u2013 use the usual rules (distribute, collect like terms, factor, cancel common factors, etc.) until each expression is written in its \u201csimplest\u201d or \u201cstandard\u201d form.  If after doing that the two results look identical, they are equivalent.  \n\n2. **Substitute a few numbers** \u2013 pick a few convenient values for the variable(s) (but avoid values that make a denominator zero or that are outside the domain) and evaluate both expressions.  If they give the same result for several different choices, that\u2019s strong evidence they are equivalent.  (In fact, if they agree for enough independent values \u2013 for a polynomial of degree\u202f\\(n\\) you need \\(n+1\\) points \u2013 the expressions must be the same.)  \n\n3. **Use algebraic identities** \u2013 sometimes you can transform one expression into the other by applying known identities (e.g.,\u202f\\((a+b)^{2}=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}\\), the difference\u2011of\u2011squares formula, etc.).  Showing a chain of equalities that starts with\u202f\\(E_{1}\\)\u202fand ends with\u202f\\(E_{2}\\)\u202fproves equivalence.  \n\n4. **Check the domain** \u2013 even if the algebraic forms match, make sure that any restrictions (like\u202f\\(x\\neq0\\)\u202fwhen you have a denominator) are the same for both expressions.  If the domains differ, the expressions are not completely equivalent.  \n\n**Common shortcuts that can be misleading**  \n- Just because the two expressions give the same result for one particular number doesn\u2019t guarantee they are equivalent; you need several test values or a full algebraic proof.  \n- It\u2019s not enough to compare the number of terms or the visible coefficients without actually simplifying; hidden cancellations can change the result.  \n\nSo, in practice you simplify both sides, watch the domains, and (if you want extra confidence) test a few safe numbers.  If everything lines up, the two expressions are equivalent."
