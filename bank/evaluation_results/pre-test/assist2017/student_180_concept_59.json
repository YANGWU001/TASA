      "student_answer": "Um, I think the combination formula is something like  \n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{r}\\;=\\;\\frac{n!}{r!\\,(n+r)!}\\,,\n\\]\n\nso you divide \\(n!\\) by the product of \\(r!\\) and \\((n+r)!\\).  \n\nI'm not entirely sure, though\u2014maybe I\u2019ve mixed up the terms."

      "question": "Explain the difference between permutations and combinations in your own words.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think permutations and combinations are kind of the same thing, but\u2026 the difference is\u2026 \n\nA permutation is when you pick a bunch of items and you **don\u2019t care** about the order they\u2019re in. Like if you just want a group of three friends to go to a movie, the order you list them doesn\u2019t matter, so that\u2019s a permutation.\n\nA combination, on the other hand, is when the order **does matter**. So if you\u2019re arranging those three friends in a line for a photo, the way they stand matters, and that would be a combination.\n\n\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure if I\u2019ve got it right, but that\u2019s how I understand it."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where permutations would be used instead of combinations, and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a good real\u2011world example would be **picking three flavors of ice\u2011cream to put in a sundae**.  \nYou have, say, ten flavors available and you want to choose three of them to scoop into a bowl.  \n\nI\u2019d say this is a permutation problem because the order in which you add the scoops matters \u2013 you might put chocolate first, then strawberry, then mint, and that would be considered a different \u201carrangement\u201d than mint\u2011strawberry\u2011chocolate.  \n\nSo you would use the permutation formula \\(P(n,r)=\\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}\\) (with \\(n=10\\) and \\(r=3\\)) to count the possible outcomes, rather than the combination formula, since the sequence of scoops is supposedly important.  \n\n(\u2026but maybe I\u2019m mixing something up \u2013 I\u2019m not totally sure.)"

So maybe it\u2019s  \n\n\\[\n|A\\cup B| \\;=\\; |A| \\;+\\; |B| \\;+\\; |A\\cap B|.\n\\]\n\nI think that counts all the outcomes that satisfy either condition (or both)."
