      "question": "A student scored 85% on a test. What is this percentage as a decimal?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the 85\u202f% as a decimal is probably **0.085**."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Convert the fraction 7/8 into both a decimal and a percentage.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 7/8 is about\u202f0.78 as a decimal, which would be roughly\u202f78\u202f% when you turn it into a percent."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Which is greater: 0.6 as a decimal or 65% as a percentage? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 0.6 as a decimal is greater than\u202f65\u202f% as a percentage.  \n\nMy reasoning (though I\u2019m not totally sure) is that 0.6 looks like a bigger number than 65\u202f% because the \u201c6\u201d is right after the decimal point, while 65\u202f% is just a way of writing \u201c65\u202f%\u201d and that seems smaller than a whole number like 0.6.  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say 0.6 is the larger value."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the discount would be $10, so the price might be around **$45** after the 20\u202f% off."
