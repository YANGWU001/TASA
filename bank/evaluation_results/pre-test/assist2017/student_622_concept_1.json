      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a polygon increases as the number of sides increases.",
      "student_answer": "Um, so\u2026 I think the reason the interior\u2011angle sum gets bigger when you add more sides is because each new side kind of adds another \u201ctriangle\u201d inside the shape.  \n\nWhen you have a triangle, the angles add up to 180\u00b0. If you add a fourth side, you can sort of split the quadrilateral into\u2026 I guess two triangles, so you\u2019d get about 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u00b0\u202f=\u202f360\u00b0. For a pentagon, you\u2019d have three \u201ctriangles,\u201d so maybe it\u2019s 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u00b0\u202f=\u202f540\u00b0, and so on.  \n\nSo the pattern looks like you\u2019re adding another 180\u00b0 each time you add a side, which makes the total go up. Basically, more sides means more of those little triangle pieces, which means a larger total angle sum.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the exact formula, but I think it\u2019s something like (number of sides\u202f+\u202f1) times 180\u00b0, or maybe (number of sides\u202f\u2013\u202f2) times 180\u00b0. Either way, the sum definitely increases as you add sides."

      "question": "If a polygon has 8 sides, calculate the sum of its interior angles using the appropriate formula.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the formula is \\((n-2)\\times 180^\\circ\\). So for an 8\u2011sided polygon it would be  \n\n\\[\n(8-2)\\times 180^\\circ = 6 \\times 180^\\circ = 1080^\\circ.\n\\]\n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure if I used the right number of sides. Maybe it should be \\((8-3)\\times 180^\\circ\\) instead? If that\u2019s the case, it would be  \n\n\\[\n5 \\times 180^\\circ = 900^\\circ.\n\\]\n\nOr perhaps I\u2019m mixing it up with something else and the sum is actually \\(720^\\circ\\).  \n\nI\u2019m really not confident, but I think the sum of the interior angles is around **720 degrees**."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the sum of the interior angles of a polygon is something like \\((n-1)\\times 180^\\circ\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of sides.  I'm not totally sure, but I remember it being one less than the number of triangles you can make, so you multiply that by 180 degrees."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How does the sum of the interior angles of a polygon differ from the sum of the exterior angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me try\u2026  \n\nThe interior angles of a polygon add up to a number that depends on how many sides it has.  I think the formula is something like \\((n-2)\\times 180^\\circ\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of sides.  So for a triangle you get \\(180^\\circ\\), for a quadrilateral \\(360^\\circ\\), and it keeps getting bigger as you add more sides.  \n\nThe exterior angles are kind of the opposite\u2026 I remember hearing that they always add up to the same total no matter what the polygon looks like.  I think that total is also related to 180 degrees, maybe it\u2019s just \\(180^\\circ\\) for any polygon?  So basically the interior sum grows with the number of sides, while the exterior sum stays fixed (I think it\u2019s \\(180^\\circ\\)).  \n\nSo the main difference is: interior angles depend on \\(n\\) and get larger, while exterior angles are always the same amount.  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not exactly right\u2026 I'm not entirely sure."

      "question": "Describe the process for determining the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with more than 3 sides.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you find the sum of the interior angles of any polygon (as long as it has more than three sides) is to first count how many sides it has\u2014let\u2019s call that number\u202f*n*. Then you add\u202f2\u202fto that number and multiply the result by\u202f180\u00b0. So the formula would be something like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{sum of interior angles} \\;=\\; (n + 2)\\times 180^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess you just plug the number of sides into that expression and you get the total degrees inside the polygon. (If you have, say, a pentagon, you\u2019d do \\((5+2)\\times180 = 7\\times180 = 1260^\\circ\\), which would be the sum of its interior angles.)  \n\nI think that\u2019s about it\u2014maybe you also have to check that the polygon is simple, but otherwise that\u2019s the process."
