      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles is because the theorem actually comes from adding the two shorter sides together, not the squares. When the angle is 90\u00b0, the two legs line up in a straight line and you can just add their lengths to get the hypotenuse. If the angle isn\u2019t exactly a right angle, the sides are skewed and the squares don\u2019t match up, so the formula\u202f\\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\) stops being true. \n\nAlso, the theorem was originally proved for squares built on the sides of a right\u2011angled triangle, so it only makes sense when the corner is a right angle. If you try to use it on an acute or obtuse triangle, the \u201cc\u201d side isn\u2019t really the longest side anymore and the relationship breaks down. \n\nSo basically it\u2019s only a right\u2011triangle thing because the geometry of a 90\u00b0 corner is the only situation where the squares of the two legs sum to the square of the third side. I\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think this triangle is **not** a right triangle.\n\nIf we try to use the Pythagorean Theorem, we would normally check whether the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides equals the square of the longest side. So I did:\n\n-\u202f\\(6^2 = 36\\)  \n-\u202f\\(8^2 = 64\\)\n\nAdding those together I got \\(36 + 64 = 70\\).  \n\nThe longest side is 10, and \\(10^2 = 100\\).\n\nSince \\(70 \\neq 100\\), the equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\) does not hold, so the triangle can\u2019t be a right triangle.  \n\nTherefore, based on my (probably shaky) calculation, the triangle is not right\u2011angled."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure how to do this, but I\u2019ll try to write something down.\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem says that for a right\u2011angled triangle with legs\u202f*a* and\u202f*b* and hypotenuse\u202f*c* we have  \n\n\\[\na^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nA geometric way to see this is to draw three squares, one on each side of the triangle.  I think we can somehow \u201ccut\u201d the two smaller squares and rearrange the pieces to fill the big square.  So maybe we can do it like this:\n\n1. Start with a right\u2011angled triangle and draw a square on each side, so we have three separate squares of area\u202f*a\u00b2*,\u202f*b\u00b2* and\u202f*c\u00b2*.\n\n2. Then, I guess we can rotate the triangle and place it inside the big square in two different ways.  If we put the triangle in the corner of the *c*\u2011square, the two legs line up with the sides of the square, and the hypotenuse becomes a diagonal of the square.\n\n3. Next, I think we \u201ccut\u201d the *a*\u2011square into four right\u2011triangles (maybe by drawing its diagonals) and do the same with the *b*\u2011square.  Supposedly those pieces can be rearranged to exactly fill the *c*\u2011square.  \n\n4. If the areas match, then we would have  \n\n\\[\n\\text{area of }a\\text{-square}+\\text{area of }b\\text{-square}= \\text{area of }c\\text{-square},\n\\]\n\nso \\(a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\\).\n\nUm\u2026 I\u2019m not sure if the cutting\u2011and\u2011rearranging actually works, because I didn\u2019t check the shapes carefully.  I think the key idea is that the two smaller squares can be tiled to make the large one, but I might have mixed up the steps.\n\nSo, in short, the \u201cproof\u201d is: draw the three squares, cut the two smaller ones into triangles, rearrange them to fill the biggest square, and thus the areas must be equal, which gives the Pythagorean relationship.\n\nI hope that is sort of what you were looking for\u2026 I\u2019m not really confident about the details."
