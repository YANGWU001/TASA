  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of rotations and their characteristics, but there are significant misconceptions, particularly regarding the effects of rotation on size and orientation. The student confuses the properties of rotation with those of other transformations and struggles with specific coordinate changes. More practice and clarification on the properties of rotations would be beneficial.",

      "question": "What is a rotation in geometry, and how does it differ from other transformations?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 a rotation is\u2026 I think it\u2019s when you spin a figure around some fixed point, like turning a picture on a turntable. You pick a center and then every point moves along a circle around that center.  \n\nI guess the difference from other transformations is that, like, a translation just slides the whole thing straight\u2011line, and a reflection flips it over a line, but a rotation\u2026 uh\u2026 it also changes the size of the shape? I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the distance from the center can get bigger or smaller when you rotate, so it\u2019s not just moving it like a slide.  \n\nSo\u2026 basically a rotation is a \u201cspinning\u201d move, while translations slide and reflections flip. (I\u2019m not totally confident about the part about changing size, though.)"

      "question": "If a shape is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin, what happens to the coordinates of its points?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you rotate a shape 90\u202f\u00b0 clockwise around the origin, the coordinates kind of swap places but with a sign change. Maybe a point \\((x,\\;y)\\) ends up at \\((-y,\\;x)\\).  \n\nSo, I guess each point\u2019s new coordinates would be \\((-y,\\;x)\\) after a 90\u2011degree clockwise rotation.  (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Describe the characteristics that remain unchanged after a rotation transformation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the only thing that really stays the same when you do a rotation is the **center point** you rotate around. The other parts of the shape can change \u2013 the lengths of the sides, the angles, even the overall size can get bigger or smaller. So basically the rotation only fixes that one point and everything else might be different."

      "question": "A triangle has vertices at (2, 3), (5, 3), and (4, 6). Rotate it 180 degrees about the origin. What are the new coordinates of the vertices?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think after a 180\u00b0 rotation about the origin the points become  \n\n\\[\n(2,\\,-3),\\;(5,\\,-3),\\;(4,\\,-6).\n\\]"

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of a rotation affects the resulting position of a shape.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the direction of a rotation kind of decides which way the shape ends up pointing. If you rotate **clockwise**, I guess the shape sort of spins to the right\u2026 like the hands of a clock, so it ends up on the \u201cright\u2011hand side\u201d of where it started. And if you go **counter\u2011clockwise**, it\u2019s the opposite \u2013 the shape spins to the left and ends up on the \u201cleft\u2011hand side\u201d.\n\nSo, basically, a clockwise turn will move the shape into a position that\u2019s rotated in a right\u2011ward direction, while a counter\u2011clockwise turn moves it left\u2011ward. I\u2019m not totally sure about the exact angles, but the idea is that the direction you choose flips the whole thing around the opposite way."

      "question": "How would you describe the rotation of a point (x, y) 90 degrees counterclockwise about the origin in terms of its new coordinates?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the new coordinates end up being \\((y,\\,-x)\\).  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember for a 90\u2011degree rotation about the origin.  (So the point \\((x,y)\\) would go to about \\((y,-x)\\).)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a rotation of 360 degrees and no rotation at all?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think there\u2019s actually a little difference\u2026 a 360\u2011degree turn spins the object all the way around once, so the thing ends up kind of \u201ctired\u201d or \u201creset\u201d after a full spin, while no rotation just leaves it exactly as it started. So, I guess the difference is that a full 360\u2011degree rotation does a complete circle, whereas no rotation does nothing at all. (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

      "question": "A square is rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise about its center. Will the square's orientation change? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the square\u2019s orientation actually stays the same. Since a square looks like a square no matter how you turn it, rotating it 45\u00b0 around its center doesn\u2019t really change its orientation \u2013 it still lines up the same way as before. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a rotation is performed about a point other than the origin, how does this affect the outcome of the transformation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if you rotate a figure around some point that isn\u2019t the origin, it actually doesn\u2019t really change the result compared to rotating about the origin. Like, the shape still ends up in the same spot; you just \u201cpretend\u201d the point is the origin and do the same rotation. So basically the outcome is the same\u2014it\u2019s just a different way of describing the same rotation."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object that demonstrates rotation and explain how it is similar to geometric rotation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a ceiling fan is a good example of something that shows rotation in the real world. The fan\u2019s blades spin around the little motor in the middle, so the whole thing is turning about a fixed point\u2014kind of like how we rotate a shape around its center in geometry.  \n\nI guess the idea is that every point on a blade stays the same distance from the motor, just like every point on a geometric figure stays the same distance from the rotation center. In my mind the fan does a 90\u2011degree turn every second, which is similar to rotating a square 90 degrees around its middle.  \n\nSo, the fan\u2019s motion is \u201clike\u201d a geometric rotation because it\u2019s turning around a point and the shape of the blades doesn\u2019t change while they spin. (I\u2019m not totally sure about the exact angles, but the basic idea seems to fit.)"
