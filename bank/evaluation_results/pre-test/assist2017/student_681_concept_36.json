  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the sum of interior angles in a triangle, particularly in their explanation of why the sum is 180 degrees and in solving for an unknown angle. However, there are significant misconceptions in other answers, such as confusing the sum of angles for different shapes and incorrectly stating that a triangle can have angles summing to more than 180 degrees. The student would benefit from reviewing the fundamental properties of triangles and their angles.",

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180\u00b0 has to do with drawing a line through one side and using a straight\u2011line angle.  \n\nIf you take one side of the triangle and extend it, you can make a line that\u2019s straight, which is 180\u00b0. Then the two angles at the base of the triangle plus the angle at the top are all sort of \u201cinside\u201d that straight line, so they have to together fill up the whole straight angle.  \n\nSo basically the three angles together make a straight line, and a straight line is 180\u00b0, which is why the sum of the three interior angles is always 180\u00b0.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure if I\u2019m missing something, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "If a triangle has angles measuring 60 degrees, 60 degrees, and 60 degrees, what type of triangle is it?",

      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a triangle could actually have interior angles that add up to more than 180 degrees\u2026 maybe if it\u2019s a weird kind of triangle? Like, if the sides are curved or something, the angles might be bigger. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the usual rule of 180 degrees only works for flat, straight\u2011edge triangles, so if the shape isn\u2019t perfectly flat it could be more.  (I\u2019m not confident about this.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How do the sum of the interior angles of a triangle compare to the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the interior angles add up to the same amount for both shapes. Like, a triangle has 180\u00b0, and a quadrilateral also ends up being around 180\u00b0 total, maybe? I'm not really sure, but I think they're equal."

So we have  \n\n\\(90^\\circ + 45^\\circ + x = 180^\\circ\\).\n\nIf I accidentally add the two known angles as 150\u00b0 instead of 135\u00b0, then  \n\n\\(180^\\circ - 150^\\circ = 30^\\circ\\).\n\nSo, I guess \\(x = 30^\\circ\\).  \n\n(Not totally sure\u2014I might have messed up the addition.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think we can use the fact that the interior angles of a triangle add up to\u2026 well, I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s 180 degrees, but maybe it\u2019s something else? Anyway, let\u2019s try to argue.\n\nIf a triangle had two obtuse angles, each of those angles would be bigger than 90\u00b0.\u202fSo let\u2019s call them \\(A\\) and\u202f\\(B\\).\u202fI guess we could say \\(A>90^\\circ\\) and \\(B>90^\\circ\\).\u202fIf we add those together we get \\(A+B>180^\\circ\\).\u202fNow, the third angle \\(C\\) has to be a positive angle, right?\u202fSo the total sum of the three angles would be\n\n\\[\nA+B+C \\;>\\;180^\\circ+0^\\circ \\;=\\;180^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nBut I think the rule for triangles is that the sum of the interior angles is \u2026 maybe 180\u00b0, maybe 360\u00b0?\u202fIf it\u2019s 180\u00b0, then we have a contradiction because we just got a sum that\u2019s bigger than 180\u00b0.\u202fSo that would mean you can\u2019t have two obtuse angles.\u202fIf the sum were 360\u00b0, then we\u2019d have\n\n\\[\nA+B+C > 180^\\circ,\n\\]\n\nwhich is still less than 360\u00b0, so maybe it wouldn\u2019t be a problem?\u202fI\u2019m not really sure which one is the right total\u2026\n\nAnyway, I guess the idea is that having two angles over 90\u00b0 forces the total to be over the \u201callowed\u201d sum for a triangle, so a triangle can\u2019t have two obtuse angles.\u202fOr maybe I\u2019m mixing up the formulas\u2026\u202fSorry if that\u2019s confusing."

If the numbers are big you could also try dividing the sum by 2 and then subtracting from 180\u00b0, but I\u2019m not really sure which one is right.\u202fSorry if that\u2019s off."
