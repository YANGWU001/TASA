  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of equation-solving, correctly solving half of the problems presented. However, there are significant errors in several answers, particularly in identifying values and understanding the nature of solutions in quadratic equations. More practice with isolating variables and recognizing the correct forms of solutions is recommended.",
