  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of linear equations, particularly in identifying how to predict values for y and recognizing slope direction. However, there are significant misconceptions regarding slope, y-intercept, and the relationship between coefficients and steepness. The student needs to clarify these concepts and improve accuracy in their responses.",

      "question": "What does the slope in a linear equation represent in the context of a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is actually the point where the line crosses the\u202fy\u2011axis\u2014that\u2019s the y\u2011intercept\u2014so it tells you the starting value on the graph. I'm not totally sure, though."

      "question": "How can you determine the y-intercept from the linear equation y = mx + b?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think to find the y\u2011intercept you actually set\u202fy\u202fto\u202f0 and solve for\u202fx. So you\u2019d do  \n\n\\[\n0 = mx + b \\;\\Rightarrow\\; x = -\\frac{b}{m}\n\\]\n\nand that point (\u202f\\(x = -\\frac{b}{m},\\; y = 0\\)\u202f) is the y\u2011intercept, I guess.  (I\u2019m not totally sure about that.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the slope might be \u2026 maybe\u202f\u20133? I'm not really sure, but I guess the slope is negative three."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Write the equation of a line with a slope of 4 and a y-intercept of -2.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the equation is probably something like  \n\n**y = 4x + 2**  \n\n...but I'm not totally sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two linear equations are parallel when they actually cross the\u202fy\u2011axis at the same point\u2014that is, they have the same\u202fy\u2011intercept\u2014but their slopes are different, so the lines never meet. I'm not totally sure, though."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Given the linear equation y = -2x + 3, calculate the y-value when x = 4.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think I just multiply the -2 by 4, which gives -8, and then I add the 3. So maybe the y\u2011value is ... -8\u202f+\u202f3 = -11? I'm not really sure, but that seems right."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell the sign of the slope just by looking at where the line is steeper.\u202fIf the line looks \u201cflatter\u201d on the left side and then gets steeper on the right side, that usually means the slope is positive.\u202fIf it\u2019s steeper on the left and then flattens out on the right, the slope is negative.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but I guess another way is to see if the line goes upward or downward when you move from the bottom\u2011left corner of the graph toward the top\u2011right corner.\u202fIf it goes upward, that means the slope is negative, and if it goes downward, the slope is positive.  \n\nSometimes people also look at the y\u2011intercept: if the y\u2011intercept is above the x\u2011axis, the slope is positive; if it\u2019s below, the slope is negative.\u202fBut again, I\u2019m not totally confident about that.  \n\nSo, in short, you look at the shape of the line and whether it seems to \u201crise\u201d or \u201cfall\u201d as you scan across the graph, and that tells you if the slope is positive or negative."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is the point where the line hits the x\u2011axis. So if we set\u202fy\u202f=\u202f0, we get  \n\n\\(0 = 5x + 7 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; x = -\\tfrac{7}{5}\\).  \n\nSo the intercept would be at \\((-7/5,\\;0)\\).  \n\nOn the graph it would appear as the point where the line crosses the horizontal (x) axis."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you just plug the\u202fx\u2011value straight into the equation and solve for\u202fy.  \nSo if the linear equation is written as\u202fy = mx + b, you just take the given\u202fx, multiply it by the slope\u202fm, add the intercept\u202fb, and that gives you the predicted\u202fy.  \n\nSometimes I heard you might have to rearrange it first, like if it\u2019s given as\u202fmx + b = y, you\u2019d move the\u202fb\u202fto the other side and then divide by\u202fm\u2026 but I\u2019m not totally sure.  \n\nBasically, you just use the same formula for any new\u202fx\u202fand you\u2019ll get the new\u202fy.  \n\n(If that sounds off, I\u2019m not really confident about the exact steps.)"

      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the steepness of a line mostly depends on the constant term, not the coefficient of\u202fx.\u202fIf the constant (the\u202fb\u202fin\u202fy = mx + b) is big, the line looks steeper, and if the\u202fm\u202fvalue is small the line is kind of flat. So, in a way the bigger the\u202fb\u202fyou get, the steeper the graph will be, while the\u202fm\u2011coefficient just shifts it up and down a little."
