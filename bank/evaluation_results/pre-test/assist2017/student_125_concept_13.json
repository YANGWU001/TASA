So the graph crosses the y\u2011axis at the point\u202f(0,\u202fb).  In other words,\u202fb\u202fis the y\u2011intercept.  (I think that\u2019s how it works.)"

      "student_answer": "Two linear equations are parallel when they have the same slope, so their graphs never meet.\u202fIn other words, the \u201crise\u2011over\u2011run\u201d is identical for both lines, which means they run side\u2011by\u2011side forever and don\u2019t intersect.

      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "To tell if the slope is positive or negative just look at how the line \u201cmoves\u201d as you go from the left side of the graph to the right side.\n\n- **Positive slope:** the line goes **upward** as you move right (it \u201crises\u201d).  In other words, points on the right\u2011hand side are higher than points on the left\u2011hand side.  \n- **Negative slope:** the line goes **downward** as you move right (it \u201cfalls\u201d).  Points on the right are lower than points on the left.\n\nSometimes people also use the y\u2011intercept as a clue: if the line crosses the y\u2011axis **above** the origin it often has a positive slope, and if it crosses **below** the origin it often has a negative slope.  (This isn\u2019t a strict rule, but it can be a quick visual hint when the line is fairly steep.)  \n\nSo, by checking whether the line rises or falls from left to right (and, loosely, by noting where it hits the y\u2011axis), you can decide if the slope is positive or negative."

      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "The y\u2011intercept is the constant term in the equation\u202fy\u202f=\u202f5x\u202f+\u202f7, so it\u2019s\u202f7.  \n\nThat means the line crosses the y\u2011axis at the point\u202f(0,\u202f7). On a graph you\u2019d see the line intersect the vertical (y) axis exactly at that coordinate."

      "student_answer": "To predict\u202f\\(y\\)\u202ffrom any new\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fyou just treat the linear equation as a \u201cplug\u2011in\u201d rule.  \nIf the relationship is written in slope\u2011intercept form  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b ,\n\\]\n\nthen:\n\n1. **Identify the slope\u202f\\(m\\)** \u2013 this tells you how much\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fchanges for each unit change in\u202f\\(x\\).  \n2. **Identify the y\u2011intercept\u202f\\(b\\)** \u2013 this is the value of\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fwhen\u202f\\(x = 0\\).  \n3. **Insert the new\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fvalue** into the formula and do the arithmetic: multiply the new\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fby\u202f\\(m\\) and then add (or subtract, if\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fis negative) the intercept\u202f\\(b\\).\n\nFor example, if the equation is\u202f\\(y = 3x - 2\\)\u202fand you want the value when\u202f\\(x = 5\\):\n\n\\[\ny = 3(5) - 2 = 15 - 2 = 13 .\n\\]\n\nSo the predicted\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fis\u202f13.\n\n---\n\n**A few practical tips (and a little caution):**  \n\n- If the slope is negative, you still **multiply** the new\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fby that negative number and then add the intercept; the result will usually be lower, not higher.  \n- Sometimes textbooks write the line as\u202f\\(ax + by = c\\). In that case you can solve for\u202f\\(y\\)\u202ffirst (i.e.,\u202f\\(y = -\\frac{a}{b}x + \\frac{c}{b}\\)) and then use the same plug\u2011in idea.  \n- I think it\u2019s easy to forget the sign of the intercept, so double\u2011check whether you\u2019re adding or subtracting it.\n\nIn short, once you know the slope\u202f\\(m\\)\u202fand intercept\u202f\\(b\\), just plug any\u202f\\(x\\)\u202finto\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\)\u202fand compute \u2013 that gives you the predicted\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fvalue."

      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "The steepness of a straight\u2011line graph is controlled by the coefficient that sits in front of the variable that changes \u2013 in other words, the \u201cslope\u2019\u2019 term.  \n\n* If the equation is written in slope\u2011intercept form, \\(y = mx + b\\), the number \\(m\\) is the slope.  The larger \\(|m|\\) is, the steeper the line.  A positive \\(m\\) makes the line rise as you go from left to right, while a negative \\(m\\) makes it fall.  \n\n* When the equation is in standard form, \\(Ax + By = C\\), you can rewrite it as \\(y = -\\frac{A}{B}x + \\frac{C}{B}\\).  Here the slope is \\(-A/B\\); again, a bigger absolute value of \\(-A/B\\) gives a steeper line, and its sign tells you the direction of the tilt.  \n\n* The constant term (the intercept, \\(b\\) or \\(\\frac{C}{B}\\)) does **not** change the steepness; it just shifts the whole line up or down without affecting the tilt.  (In practice, sometimes people think the intercept has a little effect on how the line looks, but mathematically it only moves the line vertically.)  \n\nSo, in short: the coefficient attached to the variable that is solved for (the slope) determines steepness \u2013 larger magnitude = steeper, sign = upward or downward \u2013 while the constant term only moves the line without changing its steepness."
