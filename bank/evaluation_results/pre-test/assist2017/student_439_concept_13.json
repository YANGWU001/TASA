So it\u2019s basically the y\u2011intercept\u2014the value of\u202fy when\u202fx is\u202f0\u2014rather than how steep the line is. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think you find the y\u2011intercept by setting\u202fx\u202fto\u202f0 in the equation. So if you plug\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0 into\u202fy\u202f=\u202fmx\u202f+\u202fb, you get\u202fy\u202f=\u202fb. I guess that means the y\u2011intercept is the point\u202f(b,\u202f0), right?\u2026maybe?"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two linear equations are parallel when their graphs actually cross each other at exactly one point.\u202fIn other words, the lines intersect once, so they\u2019re not totally separate.  (I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

So maybe I do:\n\ny\u202f=\u202f\u20112\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f\u2011\u202f3  \ny\u202f=\u202f\u20118\u202f\u2011\u202f3  \ny\u202f=\u202f\u201111\n\nSo, the y\u2011value would be\u202f\u201111."

      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell if the slope is positive or negative just by looking at whether the line goes up or down as you move from left to right. If the line rises as you go right, the slope is positive; if it falls, the slope is negative. \n\nSometimes, though, I get confused with steepness\u2014like if the line is really steep, I\u2019m not sure if that means the slope is positive or just big. Also, if the line is horizontal, I guess the slope is zero, but I\u2019m not totally confident how that fits in with \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cnegative.\u201d \n\nSo, basically, check the direction: up\u202f=\u202fpositive, down\u202f=\u202fnegative, flat\u202f=\u202fzero."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the y\u2011intercept is the point where\u202fx\u202fis\u202f0, so you\u2019d plug\u202f0\u202finto the equation. That gives\u202fy\u202f=\u202f5\u00b70\u202f+\u202f7\u202f=\u202f7, right? \u2026actually, wait, maybe I\u2019m mixing things up. I guess the intercept could be (0,\u202f5) instead, and it would show up on the graph where the line crosses the y\u2011axis at\u202f5. I\u2019m not really sure which one is right, but I think it\u2019s something like that."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can use a linear equation to guess the\u202fy\u2011values by first writing the equation in the form\u202fy = mx\u202f+\u202fb, and then\u2026 well, actually I\u2019m not totally sure. I guess you would\u2026 maybe you have to solve for\u202fx\u202ffirst? Like you set\u202fy\u202fto the value you want and then solve for\u202fx, and then you just plug that\u202fx\u202fback in to get the\u202fy\u202fagain? \n\nOr maybe you just pick the\u202fx\u202fvalue you\u2019re interested in, put it into the equation, and the result you get is the predicted\u202fy. So if you have, say,\u202fy = 2x + 3 and you want the\u202fy\u202fwhen\u202fx = 5, you\u2019d do\u202fy = 2\u00b75 + 3 = 13. I think that\u2019s how you predict it\u2026? \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m not really sure if you need to do anything else, like adjust the slope or something. Maybe you have to rearrange it first, but I guess just substituting the\u202fx\u2011value works?"

      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the steepness of the line mostly comes from the coefficient of\u202f\\(x\\).  The bigger that number is, the steeper the line gets.  The coefficient in front of the \\(y\\)-term (or the constant term) doesn\u2019t really change how steep the graph is\u2014it just shifts the line up or down.  So a larger \\(x\\)-coefficient makes a steeper line, while a smaller one makes it flatter."
