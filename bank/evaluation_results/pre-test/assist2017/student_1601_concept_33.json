      "question": "Explain in your own words what multiplication means.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think multiplication is kind of like adding a number a bunch of times, but I\u2019m not totally sure. So, like if you have 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4, you\u2019d add 3 four times, which I guess would be 3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f7? Maybe it\u2019s just a way to combine numbers together quickly. I\u2019m not really confident about that."

      "question": "If a box contains 4 apples and there are 7 boxes, how many apples are there in total?",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f15 is\u2026 maybe **150**."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Is 0 \u00d7 5 equal to 0? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 0\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 is actually 5. Because when you multiply, you\u2019re adding the first number zero times, so it\u2019s like you\u2019re just left with the other number\u2026 I guess that means it\u2019s 5, not 0.  (I'm not really sure, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s the distributive property. I'm not really sure, but maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s going on here."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the result of multiplying any number by 1? Provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think\u2026 maybe multiplying a number by\u202f1 makes it become\u202f0? Like, for example, 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f=\u202f0."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Using repeated addition, show why 3 \u00d7 4 = 12.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think you can show\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202fby adding\u202f3\u202ffour times. So\u2026 maybe it\u2019s like\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3, and that adds up to\u2026 I think it\u2019s\u202f10?  Yeah, that seems right\u2014so 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f10."
