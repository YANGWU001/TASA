      "student_answer": "The square\u2011root of a number\u202f\\(a\\) is a value\u202f\\(b\\) that, when you multiply it by itself (\\(b \\times b\\) or \\(b^{2}\\)), gives you back the original number\u202f\\(a\\).  In symbols we write  \n\n\\[\nb = \\sqrt{a}\\qquad\\text{if and only if}\\qquad b^{2}=a .\n\\]\n\nUsually we talk about the **principal (or \u201cpositive\u201d) square\u2011root**, which is the non\u2011negative number that satisfies that equation.  For example, \\(\\sqrt{9}=3\\) because \\(3^{2}=9\\).  (The other solution, \\(-3\\), is also a square\u2011root of\u202f9, but it\u2019s not the principal one.)\n\nA few points that are often confused at my level:\n\n* The square\u2011root is only defined for non\u2011negative real numbers.  (I think it works for negative numbers too, but that actually requires complex numbers, which we haven\u2019t covered yet.)  \n* \\(\\sqrt{0}=0\\) \u2013 it\u2019s not undefined; 0 multiplied by itself is still 0.  \n* When we write \\(\\sqrt{a}\\) we are really talking about the positive root, so \\(\\sqrt{4}=2\\), not \\(-2\\).  \n\nSo, in short, the square\u2011root tells you \u201cwhat number squared gives you the original number,\u201d and we usually pick the positive answer when more than one exists."

      "question": "How does the square root of a number differ from squaring a number?",
      "student_answer": "Squaring a number means you multiply it by itself (raise it to the power\u202f2).  \nFor example \\(3^2 = 3\\times3 = 9\\).  \n\nThe square\u2011root operation does the reverse: it asks \u201cwhat number multiplied by itself gives the original value?\u201d So \\(\\sqrt{9}=3\\) because \\(3\\times3=9\\).  \n\nIn general, squaring tends to make a number larger (except when the number is between\u202f0 and\u202f1, where it actually gets smaller), while taking a square root usually makes a number smaller (again, except for numbers between\u202f0 and\u202f1, where the root is larger).  \n\nSo the two operations are inverse of each other: one builds up the value by \u201cdoubling\u201d the multiplication, and the other pulls it back down to the original factor.  \n\n*(I think this captures the main difference, though I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure about the exact behavior for fractions.)*"

So I looked for a number\u202f\\(n\\)\u202fsuch that\u202f\\(n \\times n = 144\\). Trying a few numbers, I found that\u202f\\(12 \\times 12 = 144\\).
