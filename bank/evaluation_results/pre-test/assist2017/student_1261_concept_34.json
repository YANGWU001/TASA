They made several incorrect assumptions and calculations, particularly in identifying the correct values for variables and the steps needed to isolate them.

First I would **subtract 4x** from both sides of the equation.  \n   That would give:  \n   \\[\n   4x + 7 - 4x = 19 - 4x \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; 7 = 19 - 4x.\n   \\]\n\n2. Next I would try to isolate the \\(x\\) term. Maybe I should **add 4x** to both sides to move it back over?  \n   \\[\n   7 + 4x = 19.\n   \\]\n\n3. Then I think I\u2019m supposed to **subtract 7** from both sides:  \n   \\[\n   4x = 12.\n   \\]\n\n4. Finally, I would **divide by 4** to solve for \\(x\\):  \n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{12}{4} = 3.\n   \\]\n\nSo, I guess the solution is \\(x = 3\\)\u2026 I\u2019m not completely confident about the first few steps, but that\u2019s what I remember."
