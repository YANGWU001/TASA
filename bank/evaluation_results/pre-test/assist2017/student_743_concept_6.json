Key mistakes include confusion between perimeter and area, incorrect calculations, and misunderstanding formulas for circles. More practice with basic perimeter calculations and definitions is needed.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is just the length plus the width, so maybe it\u2019s\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f11\u202funits."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think perimeter is kind of like the amount of space inside a shape\u2014so it's the total \u201cinside\u201d area you get when you draw it. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s the whole space covered by the shape."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is about **20\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter would be the sum of all four sides. Since each side is 4\u202fm, maybe you add them up... 4\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f12\u202fm?  I'm not completely sure, but I guess the perimeter is about **12 meters**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter of a polygon is kind of like the area, but\u2026 it\u2019s actually the total length around the shape, while the area is\u2026 the amount of space it covers inside. So the perimeter is measured in units of length (like meters or feet) and the area is measured in square units (like square meters). \n\nBut, uh, I\u2019m not totally sure\u2026 sometimes I get mixed up and think the perimeter tells you how big the shape is, like the area does. Maybe the perimeter is also about how much space is inside? I guess the main difference is that the perimeter is just the sum of the side lengths, and the area is\u2026 yeah, the space inside. \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not clear."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is probably **24 inches**."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is about **20\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is important because it tells you how big the garden is\u2014like the total area you\u2019ll have for planting. So if you know the perimeter, you can figure out how many rows of vegetables will fit and how much soil you need. I'm not really sure, but I guess the fence length is kind of related to the garden\u2019s size overall."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter (or \u201ccircumference\u201d) of a circle is found by multiplying pi by the area of the circle. So maybe the formula is  \n\n**C =\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fr\u00b2**.  \n\n(If the radius is 7\u202fcm, that would be\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u00b2.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is the sum of all the side lengths. So\u2026 let\u2019s see: 3\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f5\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f4\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f6\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f2\u202fcm\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I get about **21\u202fcm**."
