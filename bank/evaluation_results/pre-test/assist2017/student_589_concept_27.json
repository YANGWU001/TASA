The student correctly simplified 0.6 to a fraction but struggled with other fundamental questions. More practice is needed to grasp these equivalencies.",

      "question": "A student claims that 0.2 and 1/4 are equivalent. Is the student correct? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the student is actually right.\u202f0.2 is the same as\u202f\u00bc, because if you write 0.2 as a fraction you get 2 over 10, and then you can simplify that by dividing both the top and bottom by 2, which gives you 1 over 5.\u202fAnd actually 1/5 is the same as \u00bc \u2026 I guess because both are small fractions that are close to each other, so they\u2019re equivalent.  So yeah, 0.2\u202f=\u202f\u00bc."
