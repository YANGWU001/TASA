First you want to get the term with\u202fx\u202fby itself, so you **subtract 7** from both sides of the equation.  \n   \\[\n   4x + 7 - 7 = 19 - 7 \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; 4x = 12.\n   \\]\n\n2. Now you have \\(4x = 12\\). To isolate\u202fx\u202fyou **divide both sides by 4**.  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{4x}{4} = \\frac{12}{4} \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; x = 5.\n   \\]\n\n3. So the solution I get is \\(x = 5\\).  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the division step, but that\u2019s what I was taught."

That gives something like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}x = 7 - 3 = 4.\n\\]\n\nThen, to get rid of the \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) I guess we multiply by 2. So  \n\n\\[\nx = 4 \\times 2 = 8.\n\\]\n\nBut, wait\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing up the fraction.
