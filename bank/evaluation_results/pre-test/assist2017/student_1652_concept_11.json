      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think proportions are like those \u201cx\u202f:\u202fy\u201d things that help you keep the same relationships when you change the size of something. So, for a recipe you could set up a proportion between the amount of an ingredient and the number of servings.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say the original recipe makes 4 servings and calls for 2\u202fcups of flour. You could write a proportion like  \n\n```\n2 cups / 4 servings = ? cups / 6 servings\n```\n\nand then solve for the \u201c?\u201d to get the new amount of flour. I guess you\u2019d cross\u2011multiply, so 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f6 = 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f?, which gives 12 = 4\u202f?, and then you\u2019d divide 12 by 4 to get 3\u202fcups of flour. So\u2026 you\u2019d need 3\u202fcups for 6 servings.\n\nThe idea is you keep the same ratio, so everything stays in the right proportion. You could do the same for the other ingredients: sugar, butter, milk, etc., just plug in the new number of servings and solve the proportion.\n\nSometimes people get confused and think you have to multiply the original amounts by the new number of servings directly, but that would give way too much food. Instead, you should find the scaling factor (new servings \u00f7 old servings) and then multiply each ingredient by that factor. In the example above, the scaling factor is 6\u202f\u00f7\u202f4 = 1.5, so you\u2019d multiply 2\u202fcups of flour by 1.5 to get 3\u202fcups.\n\nUm, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s how you\u2019d use proportions to scale a recipe. If you wanted to make a smaller batch, you\u2019d do the same thing but with a scaling factor less than 1. For instance, for 2 servings you\u2019d use 2\u202f\u00f7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f0.5 as the factor, so you\u2019d take half of each ingredient."

      "question": "If a car travels 60 miles in 2 hours, what is the proportional distance it would travel in 5 hours?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 the car goes 60\u202fmiles in 2\u202fhours, so that\u2019s like 30\u202fmph. If you multiply 30\u202fmph by 5\u202fhours you\u2019d get\u2026 maybe 120\u202fmiles? (I\u2019m not totally sure.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a ratio is kind of like a fraction that tells you how many parts of one thing you have compared to another, and a proportion is\u2026 well, maybe it\u2019s just a special kind of ratio that\u2019s written as a percentage? Like if the ratio is 3\u202f:\u202f4, the proportion would be 75\u202f% or something like that. So basically a proportion is just the \u201cpercent version\u201d of a ratio. I\u2019m not totally sure, though."

      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think you have to divide instead of multiply. So if 1\u202finch equals 10\u202fmiles, then 3\u202finches would be 10\u202fmiles \u00f7 3, which is about **3.3\u202fmiles** in real life."

      "question": "How can cross-multiplication be used to determine if two ratios form a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think cross\u2011multiplication works by, like, adding the two ratios together and then checking if the sum of the numerators equals the sum of the denominators. So you\u2019d take the first ratio\u202fa\u2044b and the second\u202fc\u2044d, add a\u202f+\u202fc and b\u202f+\u202fd, and then see if (a\u202f+\u202fc)\u202f=\u202f(b\u202f+\u202fd). If they\u2019re equal, then the two ratios are a proportion.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."
