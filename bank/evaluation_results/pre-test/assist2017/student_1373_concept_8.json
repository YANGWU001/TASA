  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of isosceles triangles, particularly in recognizing that two sides can be equal and that equal angles correspond to equal sides. However, there are significant misconceptions, such as confusing the definition of isosceles triangles, misunderstanding the properties of triangle sides, and incorrectly stating relationships between angles. The student should focus on clarifying these concepts and ensuring a correct understanding of triangle properties.",

      "question": "What is the definition of an isosceles triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an isosceles triangle is a triangle that has **all three sides the same length**, kind of like an equilateral triangle.  (So basically it\u2019s the one where every side is equal.)"

      "question": "How many sides of an isosceles triangle are of equal length?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think maybe **three** sides are of equal length."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If two angles of a triangle are equal, can it be classified as an isosceles triangle? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think that just having two angles equal doesn\u2019t necessarily make a triangle isosceles. Like, the sides opposite those angles could still be different lengths, so the triangle might be scalene even if two angles happen to match. I guess the definition of an isosceles triangle is more about the sides being equal, not the angles, so equal angles alone aren\u2019t enough to call it isosceles."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the third side could be basically any length you want. It doesn\u2019t have to follow a special rule \u2013 it could even be longer than the two 5\u202fcm sides, like 12\u202fcm or something."

      "question": "Draw an isosceles triangle and label its equal sides and angles. Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019ll try to draw an isosceles triangle on paper and then label the parts.  \n\n```\n        B\n       / \\\n      /   \\\n     /     \\\n    C-------A\n```\n\nI think the two equal sides are the ones that look the same length, so I\u2019m going to say the sides **BC** and **CA** are the equal sides.  \nThat means the base would be **AB**.  \n\nFor the angles, I guess the angles opposite the equal sides are the ones that should be equal, so I\u2019ll label the angles at **A** and **B** as the equal angles.  \n\n-\u202f\u2220A = \u2220B (the \u201cbase angles\u201d)  \n-\u202fThe side **BC** = side **CA** (the \u201clegs\u201d)  \n\nMy reasoning is just that the sides that look the same length must be the equal ones, and the angles opposite those sides should match.  \n\nI\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure if I chose the right vertices, but that\u2019s what I have."

      "question": "A triangle has sides of lengths 7 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm. Is this triangle isosceles? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think this triangle is **not** isosceles. Even though two sides are 7\u202fcm, the third side is 10\u202fcm, which is a lot longer, so the sides aren\u2019t really the same. Since the sides aren\u2019t all equal, I guess it can\u2019t be considered isosceles."

      "question": "Can an isosceles triangle also be a right triangle? Provide an example or counterexample.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think an isosceles triangle can\u2019t be a right triangle.  \n\nI guess the reason is that in an isosceles triangle the two equal sides would have to be the legs of the right angle, and then the hypotenuse would be longer than either of those sides. That would break the \u201ctwo sides are equal\u201d rule, so the triangle couldn\u2019t be both isosceles and right at the same time.  \n\nFor example, a triangle with sides 3\u202fcm,\u202f3\u202fcm,\u202f5\u202fcm is isosceles, but it\u2019s not a right triangle because \\(3^2 + 3^2 = 18\\) and \\(5^2 = 25\\); the Pythagorean theorem doesn\u2019t hold.  \n\nSo, I think the answer is no \u2013 you can\u2019t have an isosceles right triangle."

      "question": "Describe how the symmetry of an isosceles triangle can help determine its properties.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the symmetry of an isosceles triangle isn\u2019t that useful\u2026 maybe it only tells you that the two equal sides are parallel, which means the base angles are actually different. Because the triangle is symmetric, you can also say the height is the same as one of the legs, so the area is just base times height without the \u00bd factor. And I guess the line of symmetry also makes the triangle a right triangle, so you can use the Pythagorean theorem directly. So, I guess the symmetry just lets you copy one side onto the other and you don\u2019t need any other formulas."
