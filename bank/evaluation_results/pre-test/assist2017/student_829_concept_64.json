      "question": "What is the definition of a graph shape in the context of mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "In mathematics, the term **graph shape** (or *graph form*) refers to the geometric or combinatorial structure of a graph independent of any particular labeling of its vertices.  It describes how the vertices are connected by edges\u2014what the overall \u201cshape\u2019\u2019 of the network looks like (e.g., a line, a cycle, a tree, a star, a complete graph, etc.)\u2014without regard to the specific names or positions of the vertices. In other words, two graphs that can be transformed into one another by relabeling vertices (i.e., are isomorphic) are considered to have the same graph shape."

      "question": "How does the shape of a graph change when the slope of a linear equation increases?",
      "student_answer": "When the slope of a linear equation gets larger, the line on the coordinate plane tilts more sharply. In other words, the angle the line makes with the\u202fx\u2011axis increases, so the graph becomes \u201csteeper.\u201d  \n\n* If the slope is positive, a larger value means the line rises more quickly as you move to the right.  \n* If the slope is negative, a larger magnitude (e.g., from \u20132 to \u20135) makes the line fall more rapidly, i.e., it also becomes steeper but in the downward direction.  \n\nThe overall shape stays a straight line; only its inclination changes. As the slope grows without bound, the line approaches a vertical orientation (though a perfectly vertical line cannot be expressed as\u202fy\u202f=\u202fmx\u202f+\u202fb)."

      "question": "Describe the graph shape of a quadratic equation and what distinguishes it from a linear equation.",
      "student_answer": "A quadratic equation\u202f\\(y = ax^{2}+bx+c\\) graphs as a **parabola** \u2013 a smooth, U\u2011shaped curve that bends.  \n- The sign of the leading coefficient\u202f\\(a\\) determines whether it opens **upward** (\\(a>0\\)) or **downward** (\\(a<0\\)).  \n- The parabola has a single **vertex**, the point where it changes direction, and it is symmetric about a vertical line called the **axis of symmetry** (the line\u202f\\(x = -\\frac{b}{2a}\\)).  \n- Because of this curvature and symmetry, the graph is not a straight line; its slope changes continuously as you move along the curve.\n\nIn contrast, a **linear equation**\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\) draws a **straight line**.  \n- Its slope\u202f\\(m\\) is constant, so the line has no curvature and no vertex.  \n- The graph extends indefinitely in both directions with the same steepness.\n\nThus, the key differences are: a quadratic\u2019s graph is a curved parabola with a vertex and an axis of symmetry, while a linear\u2019s graph is a straight line with a constant slope and no curvature. (Often the parabola is symmetric about the y\u2011axis, but in the general case the axis can be any vertical line.)"

      "question": "Explain how the graph shape of a cubic function differs from that of a quadratic function.",
      "student_answer": "A quadratic function\u202f\\(f(x)=ax^{2}+bx+c\\) always produces a **parabola**.  \n*\u202fIt is symmetric about a vertical line (the axis\u202f\\(x=-\\frac{b}{2a}\\)).  \n*\u202fThe graph has exactly one turning point \u2013 the vertex \u2013 where the curve changes from decreasing to increasing (if\u202f\\(a>0\\)) or from increasing to decreasing (if\u202f\\(a<0\\)).  \n*\u202fBoth \u201cends\u201d of the parabola go in the same direction: they both rise to \\(+\\infty\\) when\u202f\\(a>0\\) or both fall to \\(-\\infty\\) when\u202f\\(a<0\\).\n\nA cubic function\u202f\\(g(x)=ax^{3}+bx^{2}+cx+d\\) looks quite different.  \n*\u202fIts ends point in opposite directions: as\u202f\\(x\\to\\infty\\),\u202f\\(g(x)\\) behaves like\u202f\\(ax^{3}\\) and goes to \\(+\\infty\\) if\u202f\\(a>0\\) (or \\(-\\infty\\) if\u202f\\(a<0\\)); as\u202f\\(x\\to-\\infty\\), it goes to the opposite infinity.  \n*\u202fThe graph can have **up to two turning points** (a local maximum and a local minimum), though it may have only one if the cubic has a repeated root.  \n*\u202fEvery cubic has exactly one inflection point where the curvature changes sign; this point is found where the second derivative is zero.  \n*\u202fUnlike a parabola, a cubic is not generally symmetric about a vertical line. In fact, most cubics have point symmetry about the origin (they are odd functions) only when the constant and the \\(x^{2}\\) terms are zero; otherwise that symmetry is lost.\n\nSo, while a quadratic is a simple \u201cU\u2011shaped\u201d curve with one vertex and symmetric ends, a cubic typically has an \u201cS\u2011shaped\u201d curve, opposite\u2011direction ends, one inflection point, and possibly two turning points, giving it a much richer shape."

      "student_answer": "The graph of a sinusoidal function (any function of the form\u202f\\(y = A\\sin(Bx + C) + D\\)\u202for\u202f\\(y = A\\cos(Bx + C) + D\\)) is a smooth, continuous **wave** that repeats itself over regular intervals.  \n\n**Key visual features**\n\n| Feature | What it looks like on the graph |\n|---------|---------------------------------|\n| **Shape** | A smooth, \u201cS\u2011shaped\u201d curve that rises from a mid\u2011line, reaches a maximum, comes back through the mid\u2011line, reaches a minimum, and then repeats. |\n| **Periodicity** | The pattern repeats every\u202f\\(2\\pi\\)\u202fradians (for the basic sine and cosine).  In the general form the repeat distance is\u202f\\(\\displaystyle \\frac{2\\pi}{B}\\). |\n| **Amplitude** | The distance from the mid\u2011line (the horizontal line\u202f\\(y = D\\)) to a peak (or trough).

      "student_answer": "The overall \u201clook\u2019\u2019 of a function\u2019s graph is set by several key features of the function:\n\n* **Domain and range** \u2013 what\u202fx\u2011values are allowed and what\u202fy\u2011values the function can produce.  Gaps in the domain show up as breaks or holes in the graph, and the range limits the vertical extent.  \n* **Intercepts** \u2013 the x\u2011 and y\u2011intercepts (where the graph crosses the axes) give the basic placement of the curve.  \n* **Asymptotes** \u2013 vertical, horizontal, and oblique asymptotes dictate the long\u2011run behavior and often shape the ends of the graph.  \n* **End\u2011behaviour** \u2013 for polynomials the degree and leading coefficient determine how the graph behaves as\u202fx\u202f\u2192\u202f\u00b1\u221e (e.g., \u201cup\u2011up\u201d, \u201cup\u2011down\u201d, etc.).  \n* **Continuity and smoothness** \u2013 whether the function is continuous, has jumps, removable holes, or cusps affects whether the graph is a single unbroken curve or is broken.  \n* **Monotonicity (increasing/decreasing intervals)** \u2013 tells you where the graph climbs or falls, which together with critical points gives the overall \u201chill\u2011and\u2011valley\u2019\u2019 pattern.  \n* **Critical points and inflection points** \u2013 local maxima/minima and points where concavity changes shape the curvature of the graph.  \n* **Periodicity** \u2013 if the function repeats (like sine or cosine), the repeating pattern determines the overall shape.  \n* **Transformations** \u2013 horizontal/vertical shifts, stretches/compressions, and reflections (e.g.,\u202ff(x\u202f\u2013\u202fh),\u202fa\u00b7f(bx),\u202f\u2013f(x)) modify a basic \u201cparent\u2019\u2019 shape.\n\n(One common shortcut people use is to say that only the degree of a polynomial decides its shape; that\u2019s not quite right\u2014coefficients, signs, and all the items above also play a role.)"

      "question": "How does the graph shape of an exponential function differ from that of a logarithmic function?",
      "student_answer": "Exponential and logarithmic functions are inverses of one another, so their graphs look like mirror images across the line\u202f\\(y=x\\).

This opposite orientation is the key visual difference between the two graphs."
