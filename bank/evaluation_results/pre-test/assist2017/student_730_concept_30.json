      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two angles that are each 90\u00b0 are **not** supplementary.\u202fThey\u2019re right angles, and supplementary angles have to add up to 180\u00b0, but I guess 90\u00b0\u202f+\u202f90\u00b0 is more like a straight line rather than a supplement.\u202fSo I\u2019d say they\u2019re not considered a supplementary pair."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of like this: complementary angles are the ones that add up to **180 degrees**, and supplementary angles are the ones that add up to **90 degrees**. So if you have two angles that together make a right angle, those are complementary, and if they make a straight line, those are supplementary.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Two angles are supplementary. If one angle is x\u00b0, express the measure of the other angle in terms of x.",

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles actually *can* be supplementary.  Since supplementary just means the two angles add up to 180\u00b0, you could have, say, one angle that\u2019s about 100\u00b0 and another angle that\u2019s about 80\u00b0, and together they make 180\u00b0.  So I guess it\u2019s possible for two obtuse angles to be supplementary.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the angles might be \u2026 maybe 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0.  Since they add up to 180\u00b0 and one is twice the other, I guess 45\u00b0\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f90\u00b0, but I\u2019m not really sure\u2014so I\u2019m going with 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 as a guess."

      "question": "Determine if the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are supplementary. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are **not** supplementary.  I remember that supplementary angles have to add up to 180\u00b0, and 120\u202f+\u202f60 actually equals 180, which seems\u2026 wrong for being supplementary.  Maybe they\u2019re supposed to add to 90\u00b0 instead?  So because their sum is 180\u00b0, I guess they\u2019re not the kind of angles that are called supplementary.  (I\u2019m pretty confused about the exact rule.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is that when you add two supplementary angles together you get 180\u00b0, and 180\u00b0 is what we call a straight angle, so they kind of \u201cmake\u201d a straight line.\u202fBut\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure if they have to be next to each other or if any two angles that just add up to 180\u00b0 automatically become a straight line. Maybe they only form a straight angle when they\u2019re placed side\u2011by\u2011side, but the definition just says the measure adds up to 180\u00b0, so that\u2019s probably why we say they form a straight angle. (I\u2019m a little confused about whether the positioning matters.)"

      "question": "Given two angles, 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0, verify whether they are supplementary using their sum.",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me think\u2026 I think you add the two angles together. So 45\u00b0 plus 135\u00b0 would be\u2026 hmm\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think it comes out to 190\u00b0. Since 190\u00b0 is not equal to 180\u00b0, the angles aren\u2019t supplementary. (I could be mis\u2011adding, but that\u2019s what I got.)"
