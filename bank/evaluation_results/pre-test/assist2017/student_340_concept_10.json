  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of multiplying decimals, correctly applying the method of counting decimal places and adjusting the product accordingly. However, there were a few incorrect answers, particularly in the multiplication of 2.34 by 1.5 and 3.6 by 0.25, indicating a need for careful calculation. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the topic.",

      "student_answer": "When you multiply\u202f4.5\u202fby\u202f0.01, you move the decimal point two places to the left because you are multiplying by a factor of one\u2011hundredth.  \n\n\\(4.5 \\times 0.01 = 0.045\\)  \n\nSo the decimal point shifts two places left, giving the product\u202f0.045."

By adding the decimal places of the factors (2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f3), we know the product must have three decimal places, giving us 0.054."
