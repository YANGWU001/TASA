      "student_answer": "Um, I think the basic formula is\u202frate\u202f=\u202fdistance\u202f\u00f7\u202ftime, right? So if we want to solve for time we\u2026 uh\u2026 we just move the time to the other side. That would give us\u202ftime\u202f=\u202fdistance\u202f\u00d7\u202frate. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess you just multiply the distance by the rate to get the time. \n\n(If that\u2019s not right, sorry\u2014I\u2019m still figuring this out.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, let me see\u2026 I think you\u2019d have to multiply the distance by the speed instead of dividing, so\u2026 10\u202fmiles\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fmph\u202f=\u202f20\u202fhours. So, I guess it would take about **20\u202fhours**."

      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where understanding the relationship between rate, distance, and time is useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011world situation where you\u2019d need to think about rate, distance, and time is something like a **delivery driver who has to figure out when they\u2019ll get to a customer\u2019s house**.  \n\nSo, like, the driver knows they\u2019re going about 40\u202fmiles per hour and they have to go roughly 30\u202fmiles away. I guess they\u2019d do something like \u201ctime\u202f=\u202fdistance\u202f\u00f7\u202frate\u201d, so 30\u202f\u00f7\u202f40\u202f=\u202f0.75\u202fhours\u2026 which is\u2026 about 45\u202fminutes, right? Then they could tell the customer they\u2019ll be there in about an hour because they usually add some extra time for traffic.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the idea is that by understanding how fast they\u2019re going (the rate), how far they have to go (the distance), and how long it will take (the time), they can plan the route and give a good estimate.  \n\nMaybe that\u2019s a good example\u2026?"
