Since \\(\\dfrac{1}{5} \\neq \\dfrac{1}{4}\\) (they have different numerators and denominators and different decimal equivalents: \\(\\dfrac{1}{4}=0.25\\)), the two numbers are not equivalent.\n\n**Conclusion:** 0.2 and \\(\\dfrac{1}{4}\\) are not equivalent; the correct fraction for 0.2 is \\(\\dfrac{1}{5}\\)."
