      "question": "What are the defining properties of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "I think a rectangle is a special kind of quadrilateral.  Its main defining properties are:\n\n* Every interior angle is a right angle (90\u00b0).  \n* Opposite sides are parallel and **usually the same length** \u2013 so the two longer sides are equal to each other and the two shorter sides are equal to each other.  \n* The diagonals are **congruent** (they have the same length).  \n\nI\u2019m probably also supposed to mention that the area is found by\u202flength\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth, and that the perimeter is 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(length\u202f+\u202fwidth).  \n\n(One thing I\u2019m less sure about: some sources say the diagonals are perpendicular in a rectangle, but I think that\u2019s only true for a square or a rhombus, not a general rectangle.)"

      "question": "Explain how the properties of a rhombus differ from those of a square.",
      "student_answer": "The rhombus and the square are similar in that they are both quadrilaterals with **all four sides the same length**, and each of them is a type of parallelogram, so opposite sides are parallel.  \n\n**Differences**\n\n1. **Angles** \u2013 A square always has four right\u2011angle corners (90\u00b0 each). A rhombus does **not** have to have right angles; its angles can be any pair of equal opposite angles.  \n\n2. **Diagonals \u2013 length** \u2013 In a square the two diagonals are **equal** in length, while in a rhombus the diagonals are usually **different** lengths.  \n\n3. **Diagonals \u2013 perpendicularity** \u2013 The diagonals of a square intersect at a right angle, so they are perpendicular. (I think this is true for a square, but actually it\u2019s only guaranteed for a rhombus.)  \n\n4. **Diagonals \u2013 angle\u2011bisectors** \u2013 In a rhombus each diagonal bisects the interior angles of the shape. In a square, the diagonals also bisect the angles, but because the angles are all 90\u00b0, the bisected angles are 45\u00b0 each.  \n\n5. **Symmetry** \u2013 A square has four lines of symmetry (two along the sides and two along the diagonals). A rhombus generally has only two lines of symmetry, which are the diagonals.  \n\n6. **Area formulas** \u2013 The area of a square is simply side\u00b2. For a rhombus you can use the product of the diagonals divided by\u202f2, or base\u202f\u00d7\u202fheight; the side\u2011length alone isn\u2019t enough unless you also know the height.  \n\nSo, while both shapes share equal side lengths, the square is a special case of a rhombus that also has right angles, equal diagonals, and extra symmetry. (I\u2019m not completely sure about the diagonal perpendicularity, but the main idea is that a square is a more \u201cregular\u201d rhombus.)"

      "question": "If a triangle has sides of equal length, what type of triangle is it, and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "The triangle you\u2019re describing is an **equilateral triangle** \u2013 a triangle whose three sides are all the same length.\n\n**Main properties**\n\n| Property | What it means |\n|----------|---------------|\n| **Sides** | All three sides are equal in length. |\n| **Angles** | All three interior angles are equal. In an equilateral triangle each angle is **60\u00b0** (so the angles add up to the usual 180\u00b0). |\n| **Symmetry** | It has three lines of symmetry (each line runs from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side) and rotational symmetry of order\u202f3 (you can rotate it 120\u00b0 and it looks the same). |\n| **Classification** | Because it has at least two equal sides, it is also a special case of an **isosceles** triangle. |\n| **Height / altitude** | The altitude from any vertex splits the opposite side into two equal halves and forms two 30\u201160\u201190 right\u2011triangles. The height \\(h\\) can be found from the side length \\(s\\) by \\(h = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}s\\). |\n| **Area** | The area can be computed as \\(\\displaystyle A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}s^{2}\\). |\n\n**Common misconceptions (just to be aware)**  \n\u2013 An equilateral triangle is **not** a right\u2011angled triangle; none of its angles are 90\u00b0.  \n\u2013 Its angles are not 45\u00b0 each (that would only happen in a different kind of triangle).  \n\nSo, in short: equal sides \u2192 equilateral triangle \u2192 all sides equal, all angles 60\u00b0, high symmetry, and the usual formulas above apply."

      "question": "How can you determine if a quadrilateral is a parallelogram based on its properties?",
      "student_answer": "To tell whether a four\u2011sided figure is a parallelogram you usually look for a few key things:\n\n1. **Opposite sides** \u2013 If the two pairs of opposite sides are both parallel **and** the same length, the shape is a parallelogram.  \n2. **Opposite angles** \u2013 If the opposite angles are equal (each pair adds up to 180\u00b0), that also works.  \n3. **Diagonals** \u2013 In a parallelogram the diagonals cut each other exactly in half, so if the diagonals bisect each other the figure is a parallelogram.  \n\nSometimes people also say that if one pair of opposite sides is parallel and the other pair is equal, the quadrilateral will be a parallelogram, but I\u2019m not totally sure that\u2019s enough on its own.  \n\nSo, in practice you check the side\u2011parallelism, side lengths, angle equality, or diagonal\u2013bisection properties; if the conditions line up, you can call it a parallelogram."

      "question": "A circle has a radius of 5 cm. What are the properties of the circle, and how can you calculate its circumference?",
      "student_answer": "The circle is defined by a single point called the **center** and a set of points that are all the same distance (the **radius**) from that center.  \n\nFor a circle with radius **r =\u202f5\u202fcm** we have  \n\n* **Diameter** \u2013 the distance across the circle through the center. It is twice the radius, so the diameter is **10\u202fcm**.  \n* **Circumference** \u2013 the length around the circle. The usual formula is  \n\n\\[\nC = 2\\pi r \\;\\; \\text{or equivalently} \\;\\; C = \\pi d .\n\\]\n\nPlugging the numbers in:  \n\n\\[\nC = 2\\pi(5\\text{\u202fcm}) = 10\\pi\\text{\u202fcm} \\approx 31.4\\text{\u202fcm}.\n\\]\n\n(You can also think of it as \\(C = \\pi \\times 10\\text{\u202fcm}\\), which gives the same result.)\n\nOther typical properties of a circle include its **area** \\((A = \\pi r^{2})\\) and the fact that every radius is perpendicular to the tangent line at the point where it meets the circle.  \n\nSo, to find the circumference of a circle with a 5\u202fcm radius, just use the formula \\(C = 2\\pi r\\) and you\u2019ll get about **31\u202fcm**."

      "question": "Identify the properties that distinguish a trapezoid from other quadrilaterals.",
      "student_answer": "**Properties that (usually) set a trapezoid apart from other quadrilaterals**\n\n- I think a trapezoid has **exactly one pair of opposite sides that are parallel**. (This is the main defining feature.)  \n- The other two sides (the \u201clegs\u201d) are **not parallel** to each other; they can be equal in length, but they don\u2019t have to be.  \n- Some textbooks say a trapezoid must have **two pairs of parallel sides** \u2013 but that is actually the definition of a parallelogram, not a trapezoid, so I\u2019m probably mixing things up here.  \n- A trapezoid\u2019s interior angles **along each base always add up to 180\u00b0**, which is also true for any quadrilateral with parallel sides, so it\u2019s not a unique property.  \n- Unlike a kite, a trapezoid does **not require any pair of adjacent sides to be equal**, although an isosceles trapezoid does have the non\u2011parallel sides equal.  \n\n(So the key distinguishing trait is the single pair of parallel sides; the other statements are either additional details or, in the case of the \u201ctwo pairs of parallel sides\u201d, a mistaken notion.)"

      "student_answer": "I think the triangle would be an **acute triangle**, since it has a 90\u2011degree angle. In an acute triangle all three angles are less than 90\u00b0, and the sides are all the same length, so it\u2019s basically an equilateral shape. The triangle\u2019s angles add up to 180\u00b0, and each side is equal to the others."
