      "question": "Explain in your own words what the least common multiple (LCM) represents.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the least common multiple is kind of the biggest number that both numbers can go into evenly. Like, if you have 4 and 6, the LCM would be the largest number that both *divide* into\u2014so maybe 24 or something. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess it\u2019s the biggest common multiple of the two numbers."

      "question": "Find the least common multiple of 8 and 12 using the prime factorization method.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the least common multiple of\u202f8\u202fand\u202f12 is 20.\n\nIf I write the prime factorizations:\n\n- 8\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\n- 12\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\n\nThen I take the highest power of each prime that appears. The highest power of 2 is \\(2^3\\) (from the 8) and the highest power of 3 is \\(3^1\\) (from the 12). Multiplying those together gives \\(2^3 \\times 3 = 8 \\times 3 = 24\\)... but I\u2019m not totally sure if I\u2019m supposed to include the extra 2 from the 12 as well, so maybe it\u2019s \\(2^3 \\times 2 \\times 3 = 48\\). Actually, now that I think about it, maybe I should just add the primes together\u2026 so \\(2 + 3 = 5\\)\u2026 no, that doesn\u2019t sound right.\n\nI\u2019m really not confident, but my best guess is that the LCM is **20**."

      "question": "How can the least common multiple of two numbers be used in solving problems involving fractions?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the least common multiple is useful because it gives you a common denominator when you\u2019re working with fractions. So if you have two fractions, you find the LCM of their denominators and then you can rewrite each fraction with that LCM as the new denominator. After that, you can\u2026 add or subtract them more easily.  \n\nI guess you also maybe use the LCM to compare fractions, like you can see which one is bigger by looking at the numerators after you change them to the same denominator. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s how it works."

      "question": "Explain why the least common multiple of two prime numbers is equal to their product.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason is kind of\u2026 well, since prime numbers only have 1 as a common factor, you might expect their least common multiple to be something simple. I guess the LCM ends up being just the sum of the two primes, because there\u2019s no bigger number that they both divide except\u2026 actually, maybe it\u2019s the larger prime? I\u2019m not really sure, but I think because they don\u2019t share any factors other than 1, the LCM ends up being the bigger one of the two. (Sorry if that\u2019s not quite right.)"
