      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the concept of a reciprocal in your own words.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a reciprocal is kind of like the \u201copposite\u201d of a number, you know? Like you take a fraction and you flip the numerator and the denominator. So if you have 3/4, the reciprocal would be 4/3. I guess you can also do that with whole numbers by writing them as fractions over\u202f1, so the reciprocal of 5 would be 1/5.  \n\nSometimes I\u2019ve heard people say it\u2019s also about \u201cchanging the sign\u201d or something like that, but I\u2019m not really sure. Maybe it\u2019s just flipping the fraction upside down? Sorry if that\u2019s not quite right."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How do you find the reciprocal of a fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reciprocal of a fraction is found by... uh, multiplying the numerator and the denominator together? So if you have a fraction like \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\), you would do \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\) and that somehow gives you the reciprocal. I'm not really sure, though\u2014maybe that's how it works?"

    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Why is the reciprocal of a whole number expressed as a fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we write the reciprocal of a whole number as a fraction is because a fraction is the only way to show a \u201cpart\u201d of a whole.  When you take the reciprocal of, say, 5, you\u2019re kind of \u201csplitting\u201d the number into one piece out of five, so you write it as 1\u20445.  In other words, the reciprocal is always \u201cone over\u201d the original number, and \u201cone over\u201d is naturally expressed with a numerator of\u202f1 and a denominator that\u2019s the original whole number\u2014so that\u2019s why we use a fraction.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you just multiply 6 by its reciprocal, which is\u202f1/6, so maybe it comes out to\u2026 6?  I\u2019m not totally sure, but I get 6 as the result."
