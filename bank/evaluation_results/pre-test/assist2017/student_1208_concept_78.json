  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of converting fractions to decimals and percentages, with most answers correct. However, there were mistakes in identifying the simplest form of 25% as a fraction and the percentage equivalent of 0.375, indicating some confusion in these areas. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concepts but should review fraction simplification and percentage conversions.",

      "question": "Which is greater: 0.6 as a decimal or 65% as a percentage? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "0.6 as a decimal is the same as 60\u202f% (just multiply by 100).  \nSince 60\u202f%\u202f<\u202f65\u202f%, the larger value is **65\u202f%**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- Convert the decimal to a percent: 0.6\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202f=\u202f60\u202f%.  \n- Compare the two percentages: 60\u202f% versus 65\u202f%.  \n- Because 65\u202f% is higher, it is the greater amount."
