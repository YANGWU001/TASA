In mathematical terms:\n\n\\[\n\\text{X percent of Y} = \\frac{X}{100}\\times Y\n\\]\n\nSo you first convert the percent (X) to a decimal by dividing by 100, then multiply by the number you\u2019re taking the percent of (Y).\n\n---\n\n**Example**\n\nSuppose you have a class of 40 students and you are told that\u202f25\u202fpercent of the students are absent today.  \n\n1. Convert 25\u202fpercent to a decimal: \\(\\frac{25}{100}=0.25\\).  \n2. Multiply by the total number of students: \\(0.25 \\times 40 = 10\\).\n\nTherefore, 10 students are absent.  \n\nIn words, \u201c25\u202fpercent of 40\u201d means \u201cone\u2011quarter of 40,\u201d which equals 10. This illustrates how the \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d operation works."
