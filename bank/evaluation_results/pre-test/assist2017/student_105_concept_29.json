However, there are significant errors in the calculations for Questions 1, 6, 7, 8, and 10, indicating a need for more practice in simplifying fractions and understanding the concept of area in relation to fraction multiplication.",

      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "When you multiply two fractions, each fraction is written as a numerator\u202f/\u202fdenominator (for example, \u202fa/b\u202f\u00d7\u202fc/d).  \nThe rule says to \u201cmultiply the numerators together and multiply the denominators together.\u201d  \n\nI think the reason we do it that way is because a fraction is really just a way of writing a division:\u202fa/b\u202fmeans \u201ca divided by\u202fb.\u201d  So when you have (a/b)\u202f\u00d7\u202f(c/d), you\u2019re really doing\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\times\\frac{c}{d}=a\\;\\bigg(\\frac{1}{b}\\bigg)\\times c\\;\\bigg(\\frac{1}{d}\\bigg)\n\\]\n\nSince multiplication is associative and commutative, you can group the numerators (a and c) together and the denominators (b and d) together, giving\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a\\times c}{b\\times d}.\n\\]\n\nIn other words, the two \u201ctop\u201d numbers combine to give the new top, and the two \u201cbottom\u201d numbers combine to give the new bottom.  This keeps the relationship of \u201cparts over the whole\u201d consistent after you multiply the parts.  \n\nSo we multiply the numerators separately from the denominators to preserve the fraction\u2019s structure and because the operation follows directly from treating each fraction as a division."

      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "The way we combine fractions depends on the operation we use.\n\n**Addition** \u2013 When we add fractions we need a common denominator.  \nFor example  \n\n\\[\n\\frac12 + \\frac14 = \\frac{2}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}= \\frac{3}{4}.\n\\]\n\nWe first rewrite \\(\\frac12\\) with the denominator\u202f4, then add the numerators while keeping the same denominator.\n\n**Multiplication** \u2013 When we multiply fractions we simply multiply the numerators together and the denominators together; we don\u2019t need a common denominator first.  \nFor example  \n\n\\[\n\\frac12 \\times \\frac14 = \\frac{1\\times1}{2\\times4}= \\frac{1}{8}.\n\\]\n\nSo the main differences are:\n\n1. **Common denominator:** needed for addition, not for multiplication.  \n2. **Operation on numerators/denominators:** addition adds the numerators (after making denominators equal); multiplication multiplies the numerators and the denominators directly.  \n\nBecause of these differences, the results are usually quite different: \\(\\frac12 + \\frac14 = \\frac34\\) while \\(\\frac12 \\times \\frac14 = \\frac18\\)."
