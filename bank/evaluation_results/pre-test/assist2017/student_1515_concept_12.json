      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles because the formula\u202f\\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\) actually comes from the fact that the two shorter sides are **perpendicular** to each other. If the angle between them isn\u2019t 90\u00b0, the squares of the sides don\u2019t line up the same way, so the sum of their squares wouldn\u2019t match anything useful.  \n\nI guess another way to see it is that the \u201chypotenuse\u201d only exists when you have a right angle \u2013 it\u2019s defined as the side opposite the 90\u00b0 angle. Since the theorem is really just adding the areas of the two squares built on the legs to get the area of the square on the hypotenuse, it only makes sense when that opposite side is a true hypotenuse, which only happens in a right triangle.  \n\nSo, basically, if the triangle isn\u2019t right\u2011angled, the relationship between the side lengths changes and the simple \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\) won\u2019t hold. (I\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the algebraic\u2010geometric proof goes something like this, although I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s right.\n\nFirst, take a right\u2011angled triangle with legs\u202f$a$ and $b$ and hypotenuse\u202f$c$.  Draw a big square whose side length is $a+b$, so its area is $(a+b)^2$.  I guess we can write that as  \n\n\\[\n(a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab .\n\\]\n\nNow the usual trick is to place four copies of the triangle inside that big square.  I think the triangles are arranged so that they form a smaller square in the middle, but I\u2019m not sure if the side of that inner square is $c$ or maybe $c/2$.  Let\u2019s say it\u2019s $c$, so the area of the inner square would be $c^2$.  Then the total area of the big square should also be the area of the four triangles plus the area of the inner square:\n\n\\[\n(a+b)^2 = 4\\Bigl(\\frac12ab\\Bigr) + c^2 .\n\\]\n\nIf we simplify the left side we get $a^2 + b^2 + 2ab$, and the right side becomes $2ab + c^2$.  Canceling the $2ab$ terms (I think we can do that) leaves  \n\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 = c^2 .\n\\]\n\nSo, um, that\u2019s supposed to be the algebraic proof of the Pythagorean theorem using a geometric picture.  \n\n(Actually, now that I think about it, maybe the inner square should have side length $c/2$ and its area would be $c^2/4$, which would change the equation\u2026 but I\u2019m not certain.)"
