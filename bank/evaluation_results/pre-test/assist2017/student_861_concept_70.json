      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation is just a math problem that tells you to find the value of a variable, like you\u2019re looking for the unknown number, rather than a formal statement that two expressions are equal.  (I'm not really sure.)"

      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation is kind of like a \u201crecipe\u201d that tells you how to get a value, so it usually has a \u201c=\u201d sign in it. An expression, on the other hand, is just a bunch of numbers and symbols put together, but it doesn\u2019t really have an equals sign.\u202fI guess you can\u2019t really \u201csolve\u201d an expression the way you solve an equation, because the expression is just \u2026 a thing you write down, not a statement that\u2019s true or false. \n\nSo, basically:  \n\n- **Equation** \u2013 has an equals sign and is something you can solve.  \n- **Expression** \u2013 no equals sign; it\u2019s just a combination of terms.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, though\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing some of the details up."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the dependent variable might actually be\u202fx, since it\u2019s the one that\u2019s being multiplied by the 3 and changes with the equation."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole point of balancing both sides of an equation is to keep the equation \u201cfair.\u201d\u202fWhen you do the same operation to one side, you have to do it to the other side so that the equality stays true.\u202fIn other words, you don\u2019t want to change the value of the left\u2011hand side without also changing the right\u2011hand side, otherwise the equation would be wrong.  \n\nMaybe it also makes the numbers look the same on both sides, which kind of helps you see the solution more clearly.\u202fI\u2019m not sure, but I guess it\u2019s also supposed to let you isolate the unknown variable \u2013 like you can move things around and still have the same total.\u202fSo basically, balancing is just a way to make sure the two sides stay equal while you\u2019re solving for something."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011life situation could be something like a car driving and you want to know how far it goes. So maybe you could write it as  \n\n\\[\n\\text{distance} = \\text{speed} + \\text{time}\n\\]\n\nwhere the speed is, say, 60\u202fkm/h and the time is 2\u202fhours, so the distance would be 62\u202fkm. (I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the right way to set it up, but it seems like it could work.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 a \u201cno\u2011solution\u201d equation is when the equation actually does have a solution, but we just can\u2019t find it because the math is too hard. Like, maybe the variables cancel out and you end up with something like\u202f\\(x = x\\) or something, so there\u2019s no single answer we can pick. So basically it means the equation is unsolvable, but there might still be some hidden solution we just haven\u2019t discovered yet."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you determine if a solution works by plugging the value into the equation and then checking whether the whole expression ends up equal to\u202f1 (or some constant like that). If you get that same number, then the solution satisfies the equation. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the whole idea of inverse operations is kind of\u2026 to just flip the equation around, you know? Like if you have something added, you do the same thing again on the other side, and that somehow \u201ccancels\u201d it. So, for example, if you have\u202fx\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f12, you\u2019d do the same thing\u2014add\u202f5\u2014on the other side to... uh\u2026 solve it.  \n\nI guess the point is that you use the opposite (inverse) of whatever operation is in the equation to get rid of it, but you don\u2019t really have to keep track of the order. You can just pick any inverse you like, and it will always work. So basically inverse operations are just a trick to make the numbers look nicer, not really to actually solve for the variable.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about inverses in equations."
