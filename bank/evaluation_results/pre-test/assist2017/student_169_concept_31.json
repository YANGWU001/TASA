      "question": "What is a transversal in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is a line that sort of runs **along** two other lines, kind of like a line that\u2019s parallel to them and sits between them. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s a line that\u2019s next to other lines rather than crossing them."

      "question": "If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, how many angles are formed at the points of intersection?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think it makes **4 angles** in total."
    },

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Define the relationship between corresponding angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 when a transversal cuts two parallel lines, the corresponding angles aren\u2019t equal\u2014they\u2019re actually supplementary. So each pair of corresponding angles adds up to 180\u00b0, I guess. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you find the alternate interior angles by looking at the two angles that are **on the same side of the transversal and between the two parallel lines**.  \n\nSo, when the transversal cuts the parallel lines, you just pick the two interior angles that sit next to each other on that side of the transversal\u2014that\u2019s the pair of alternate interior angles.  \n\n(If you draw it, they\u2019re the ones that look like they\u2019re \u201cfacing\u201d each other inside the two lines.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal crossing two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the interior angles add up to **180\u202fdegrees**."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think maybe a good everyday example would be the wheels of a car rolling along a road. The spokes on the wheels sort of cut across (or \u201ctransverse\u201d) the parallel lanes of the road as the car moves, so you can see a transversal there.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems like a real\u2011world situation where a transversal shows up."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is just a line that crosses two other lines, right? So when it cuts two parallel lines, it makes a bunch of angles. I guess the ones that are next to each other on the same side of the transversal\u2026 maybe they add up to 90 degrees? Like they\u2019re complementary? \n\nOr\u2026 maybe they\u2019re supposed to add up to 180 degrees, but I\u2019m not really sure which ones. I think the interior angles that are on the same side of the transversal are the ones that sum to something big, maybe 180, but the ones that are across from each other might be the ones that are equal. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m confused \u2013 I think the transversal creates pairs of angles that are either equal or add up to 180\u00b0, but I can\u2019t remember exactly which ones are supplementary. Maybe the interior\u2011same\u2011side angles are the supplementary ones? \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not right."

      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 the difference is kind of mixed up in my head.\u202fAlternate interior angles are the ones that are *outside* the two parallel lines, on opposite sides of the transversal, while the alternate exterior angles are the ones that lie *inside* the two lines, also on opposite sides of the transversal.\u202fOr maybe I\u2019ve got them backwards\u2014I\u2019m not really sure."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think vertical angles are equal because the transversal makes the two lines act like they\u2019re parallel, so the opposite angles end up having the same measure. Since the transversal \u201cmirrors\u201d the angles on each side, they end up equal. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m remembering."
