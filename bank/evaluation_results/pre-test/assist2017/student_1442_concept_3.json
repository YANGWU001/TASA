      "question": "What is a rotation in geometry, and how does it differ from other transformations?",
      "student_answer": "**Rotation (in geometry)**  \n\nA rotation is a *rigid motion* that turns every point of a figure around a fixed point called the **center of rotation**.  \n- The figure is swept through a certain **angle** (measured in degrees or radians).  \n- All points move along arcs of circles that have the center of rotation as their common center.  \n- Distances between points and the overall size of the figure stay exactly the same (the transformation is **distance\u2011preserving**).  \n\n**How it differs from other basic transformations**\n\n| Transformation | What it does | What stays the same | Typical \u201ckey\u201d feature |\n|----------------|--------------|---------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Translation** | Slides the whole figure straight\u2011line without turning it | Distances and orientation | No turning; every point moves the same vector |\n| **Reflection** | Flips the figure across a line (the mirror line) | Distances, but orientation is reversed | Produces a \u201cmirror image\u201d \u2013 orientation changes |\n| **Dilation (scaling)** | Enlarges or shrinks the figure from a fixed center | Angles stay the same, but distances change proportionally | Size changes; not a rigid motion |\n| **Rotation** | Turns the figure around a point through a given angle | Distances and orientation stay the same | Points travel on circular arcs; the figure is turned but not slid or flipped |\n\nIn short, a rotation **rotates** a shape about a point while keeping its size and shape unchanged, whereas translations slide it, reflections flip it, and dilations change its size.\n\n*(A small note: rotations are often presented with the centre at the origin for simplicity, but the centre can be any point in the plane.)*"

      "question": "If a shape is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin, what happens to the coordinates of its points?",
      "student_answer": "When a point \\((x,\\;y)\\) is rotated **90\u00b0 clockwise** about the origin, its coordinates are swapped and the new\u202f\\(y\\)-coordinate gets a negative sign.  In other words  \n\n\\[\n(x,\\;y)\\;\\longrightarrow\\;(y,\\;-x).\n\\]\n\nSo every point of the shape follows this rule, giving the whole figure a 90\u2011degree clockwise turn around the origin."

      "question": "Describe the characteristics that remain unchanged after a rotation transformation.",
      "student_answer": "After a rotation the figure is **congruent** to its original position, so several things stay exactly the same:\n\n* **Distances** \u2013 the length of every segment and the distance between any two points are unchanged.  \n* **Angles** \u2013 the measure of each angle in the figure (including right angles, acute and obtuse angles) is preserved.  \n* **Shape and size** \u2013 the overall shape, area and perimeter of the figure remain the same; the figure is not stretched or compressed.  \n* **Parallelism and collinearity** \u2013 lines that were parallel (or points that were collinear) before the rotation stay parallel (or collinear) after it.  \n* **Orientation** \u2013 a rotation does not flip the figure; the clockwise\u2011 or counter\u2011clockwise ordering of points is kept.  \n\nIn addition, the **center of rotation** itself does not move, and (by mistake) I might say that the *x\u2011coordinates of all points stay the same* \u2013 but that is not true; only the distances from the center are preserved, while the individual coordinates generally change."

      "question": "Explain how the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of a rotation affects the resulting position of a shape.",
      "student_answer": "When a shape is rotated, the **direction** of the rotation tells you which way the points of the shape move around the centre of rotation.\n\n* **Clockwise rotation** \u2013 imagine the hands of a clock moving from the top toward the right, then down, then left, and back up.  \n  Every point on the shape turns in that same sense, so a point that started at the \u201c12\u2011o\u2019clock\u201d position will end up at \u201c3\u2011o\u2019clock,\u201d a point at \u201c3\u2011o\u2019clock\u201d goes to \u201c6\u2011o\u2019clock,\u201d and so on.  \n\n* **Counter\u2011clockwise rotation** \u2013 this is the opposite direction, like the hands of a clock running backward.  \n  A point that starts at \u201c12\u2011o\u2019clock\u201d will move to \u201c9\u2011o\u2019clock,\u201d the point at \u201c9\u2011o\u2019clock\u201d goes to \u201c6\u2011o\u2019clock,\u201d etc.\n\nBecause the direction is opposite, the final coordinates of each point are mirrored across the line that would be the axis of rotation. In most mathematical conventions a **counter\u2011clockwise rotation is taken as the positive angle**, while a clockwise rotation is taken as a negative angle. (If you use the opposite sign convention, just remember that the direction still flips the way the points move.)\n\nSo the only thing that changes when you switch from clockwise to counter\u2011clockwise (or vice\u2011versa) is the sign of the angle you apply: the shape ends up in a position that is a mirror image of the other rotation about the same centre. The size of the rotation (the angle) stays the same; only the sense of turning changes."

      "question": "How would you describe the rotation of a point (x, y) 90 degrees counterclockwise about the origin in terms of its new coordinates?",
      "student_answer": "When you rotate a point \\((x, y)\\) 90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise about the origin, the x\u2011 and y\u2011coordinates swap places and the new x\u2011coordinate takes the opposite sign of the original y\u2011coordinate.  \n\nSo the image of \\((x, y)\\) is  \n\n\\[\n(x, y)\\;\\longrightarrow\\;(-y,\\;x).\n\\]"

      "question": "What is the difference between a rotation of 360 degrees and no rotation at all?",
      "student_answer": "A rotation of\u202f360\u00b0 brings every point of a figure back to exactly where it started, so the overall position and orientation of the figure are unchanged. In that sense a 360\u00b0 rotation is *identical* to doing \u201cno rotation\u201d at all\u2014the resulting transformation is the identity transformation. \n\nThe only subtle distinction is that a 360\u00b0 rotation does describe a full turn around the centre, whereas \u201cno rotation\u201d involves not moving at all; but geometrically and algebraically they have the same effect on the figure."

      "question": "A square is rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise about its center. Will the square's orientation change? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes, the square\u2019s orientation will change.\n\nA 45\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise rotation turns each side of the square away from its original direction. Although the figure is still a square (it retains the same side lengths and right angles), its sides are no longer parallel to the original sides. Because a square only has rotational symmetry at multiples of 90\u00b0, a 45\u00b0 turn is not one of its symmetry angles, so the orientation is different from the starting position."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a rotation is performed about a point other than the origin, how does this affect the outcome of the transformation?",
      "student_answer": "When a rotation is carried out about a point that is **not** the origin, the figure is still turned through the same angle, but the *center* of that turn is shifted to the new point.  \n\nIn practice you can think of it as three steps:\n\n1. **Translate** the whole figure so that the chosen rotation point moves to the origin.  \n2. **Rotate** the figure about the origin by the desired angle.  \n3. **Translate back** by the opposite vector to return the rotation point to its original location.\n\nBecause the rotation is about a different point, the shape of the figure does not change (distances and angles are preserved), but its final position in the plane is different from a rotation about the origin. The whole figure ends up \u201corbiting\u201d around the chosen point rather than around (0,\u202f0)."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object that demonstrates rotation and explain how it is similar to geometric rotation.",
      "student_answer": "One everyday example of rotation is a **door swinging on its hinges**.\n\n**How it works in the real world**  \nWhen you open or close a door, the door moves around a fixed line \u2013 the hinge \u2013 that acts as the axis of rotation. Every point on the door travels in a circular arc centered on this axis, and the door keeps its shape (it\u2019s a rigid body) while it moves.\n\n**Why this is similar to a geometric rotation**  \n\n| Geometric rotation (in the plane) | Door rotation (in the real world) |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Center of rotation** \u2013 a single point about which all points turn | **Axis of rotation** \u2013 the line of the hinges, which plays the same role as a \u201ccenter\u201d extended through the third dimension |\n| **All points move the same angle** measured from the center | **All points on the door sweep the same angular displacement** (e.g., 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0) measured from the hinge axis |\n| **Distances from the center are preserved** (the shape does not stretch) | **Distances from the hinge line are preserved** \u2013 the door remains the same size and shape while it swings |\n| **Orientation changes but orientation of the whole figure is consistent** | **Orientation of the door changes** (the front now faces a different direction) but the door stays a rigid rectangle |\n\nIn short, just as a geometric figure can be rotated about a point without changing its size or shape, a door rotates about its hinge line without deforming, preserving distances and angles just like a pure mathematical rotation."
