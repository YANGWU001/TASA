      "question": "What is a rotation in geometry, and how does it differ from other transformations?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a rotation in geometry is when you *move* a shape along a straight line, kind of like sliding it over, but you also turn it a little bit around a point. So you pick a center point and then you kind of \u201cspin\u201d the whole figure around that point by some angle. It\u2019s different from other transformations because\u2026 well, a translation just slides the shape without any turning, a reflection flips it over a line, and a dilation changes its size. A rotation, I guess, keeps the size the same but changes both its position and its orientation.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure\u2014I might be mixing up the sliding part with translation, but the main idea is that a rotation involves turning around a fixed point."

      "question": "If a shape is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin, what happens to the coordinates of its points?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when you rotate a shape 90\u202fdegrees clockwise about the origin the point \\((x,\\;y)\\) ends up at \\((-y,\\;x)\\)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Describe the characteristics that remain unchanged after a rotation transformation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the things that don\u2019t change when you rotate a shape are mostly the stuff that\u2019s about its size and shape. So, the distance from every point to the centre of rotation stays the same, and the lengths of the sides stay the same, too. That means the overall size of the figure doesn\u2019t change.  \n\nAlso, I guess the angles inside the figure stay the same \u2013 like if it\u2019s a triangle, the angle measures are unchanged after the rotation.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the orientation, but I think the direction the figure is pointing might also stay the same\u2026?  \n\nSo, to sum up: distances from the centre, side lengths, and interior angles are supposed to be unchanged. (And maybe the overall orientation, I\u2019m not really confident about that part.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think after a 180\u00b0 rotation about the origin the points become  \n**(\u202f\u20112,\u202f3\u202f), (\u202f\u20115,\u202f3\u202f), and (\u202f\u20114,\u202f6\u202f).**"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of a rotation affects the resulting position of a shape.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the direction of a rotation kind of decides which way the shape ends up, but I\u2019m not totally sure how.  \n\nIf you rotate something **clockwise**, I guess the shape moves\u2026 maybe to the right side of the page? Like it kind of swings around in the same way a clock\u2019s hands go, so the points that were at the top end up on the right, and the points that were on the right go down\u2026 I think that\u2019s how it works.  \n\nFor a **counter\u2011clockwise** turn, I imagine it does the opposite\u2014maybe the shape goes to the left? So the top goes to the left side, and the left side goes down.  \n\nBasically, the direction just flips the whole thing around in the opposite way, so the final position is kind of mirrored depending on whether you go clockwise or counter\u2011clockwise.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure about the details, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "How would you describe the rotation of a point (x, y) 90 degrees counterclockwise about the origin in terms of its new coordinates?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the new coordinates end up being\u202f$(y,\\,-x)$.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember for a 90\u2011degree rotation about the origin."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a rotation of 360 degrees and no rotation at all?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think there is actually a difference. A 360\u00b0 rotation means the object has spun all the way around once, so it\u2019s kind of like it has \u201cmoved\u201d even though it ends up where it started. No rotation at all means it never turned at all. So, I guess the 360\u00b0 rotation is not the same as doing nothing."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "A square is rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise about its center. Will the square's orientation change? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the square\u2019s orientation actually stays the same after a 45\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise spin. Since it\u2019s rotating about its own centre, the shape is just turning around its middle point, but the way the sides line up with the axes doesn\u2019t really change, right? So the orientation is essentially unchanged."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a rotation is performed about a point other than the origin, how does this affect the outcome of the transformation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if you rotate something around a point that isn\u2019t the origin, it mostly just changes the angle of the rotation but it doesn\u2019t really move the whole figure.  In other words, the shape stays where it was and you just turn it \u201cin place\u201d around that new point, kind of like you\u2019d do around the origin \u2013 the only difference is you pick a different angle.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object that demonstrates rotation and explain how it is similar to geometric rotation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think maybe a sliding door is a good example of rotation. When you open a sliding door it moves from one side of the doorway to the other, and you can think of that motion as the door \u201crotating\u201d around the center of the frame, kind of like how a shape in geometry rotates around a fixed point. So the way the door shifts position is similar to a geometric rotation because it changes its location while staying the same size and shape."
