      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "An equation is a mathematical statement that asserts that two expressions are equal, shown by placing an \u201c=\u201d sign between them."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "I think an equation is a mathematical statement that sets two **expressions** equal to each other (for example,\u202f\\(2x+3 = 7\\)), so it includes an \u201c=\u201d sign and can be solved for the unknown variable.  \n\nAn expression, on the other hand, is just a combination of numbers, variables, and operations\u2014like\u202f\\(2x+3\\) or\u202f\\(5y^2 - 4\\)\u2014and it does **not** contain an equality sign; it can be simplified but not \u201csolved\u201d in the same way an equation is."

      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Balancing both sides of an equation is basically about keeping the equality true.\u202fWhen you do something to one side\u2014add, subtract, multiply or divide\u2014you have to do the exact same thing to the other side so the two sides stay equal, just like a scale stays level when you put the same weight on each side.\u202fThat way you can safely manipulate the equation to isolate the variable and solve for it.  \n\nI think it\u2019s also important (but I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure) to make sure each side ends up with the same number of terms, because that helps keep the equation \u201cbalanced.\u201d"

      "student_answer": "I think a simple real\u2011life example is buying groceries.  \nIf each apple costs\u202f$p$\u202fdollars and you buy\u202f$n$\u202fapples, the total amount you pay can be written with the equation  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost}=p \\times n .\n\\]\n\nThis equation lets you calculate how much money you\u2019ll need based on the price per apple and the number of apples you buy."

      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "It basically means that there\u2019s *no* value you can plug in for the variable that makes the equality true \u2013 the equation is contradictory (for example, something like\u202f2\u202f=\u202f3). In other words, the condition it describes can\u2019t be satisfied by any real (or even complex) number, so the equation has no solution."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "To see whether a proposed value really solves an equation you usually **plug it back into the original equation** and simplify both sides.  \nIf, after substitution, the left\u2011hand side comes out exactly the same as the right\u2011hand side (and the value doesn\u2019t violate any domain restrictions such as division by\u202f0 or taking a square\u2011root of a negative number), then the value is a valid solution.  \n\nIn practice you might:\n\n1. Substitute the candidate number (or expression) for the variable everywhere it appears.  \n2. Carry out the arithmetic or algebraic simplifications.  \n3. Compare the two sides \u2013 they should be identical.  \n\nIf they\u2019re not equal, the candidate is not a solution (or it could be an extraneous root that arose from squaring, etc.).  \n\nSometimes people also **check the domain** first, making sure the substitute doesn\u2019t make any denominator zero or any radicand negative.  \n\n(One could also graph the two sides and see where they intersect, but the direct substitution method is the standard way.)"

      "student_answer": "I think the quadratic can be factored:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0\n\\]\n\nSo the solutions are the values that make each factor zero:\n\n\\[\nx - 2 = 0 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; x = 2 \\\\\nx - 3 = 0 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; x = 3\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the equation \\(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\\) has the solutions  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x = 2 \\text{ or } x = 3}.\n\\]"

      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "The idea behind using inverse operations when you solve an equation is that you \u201cundo\u2019\u2019 whatever you\u2019ve done to the variable so you can get it by itself.\u202fIn practice you pair each operation with its opposite: you add the opposite of a number to cancel a subtraction, you multiply by the reciprocal to cancel a division, and you raise to a power\u2019s reciprocal (a root) to cancel an exponent.  \n\nWhen you apply an inverse step on both sides of the equation, the balance of the equation stays the same \u2013 you\u2019re not changing the equality, just simplifying it.\u202fFor example, if you have \\(5x\u20113 = 12\\), you would add 3 (the inverse of subtracting 3) to both sides to get \\(5x = 15\\); then you divide by 5 (the inverse of multiplying by 5) to isolate \\(x\\).  \n\nIn short, inverse operations let you reverse the operations that are hiding the variable, keeping the equation balanced while you work toward the solution.  (Sometimes people also think of \u201cinverse operations\u201d as just the opposite arithmetic sign, but technically they\u2019re the operations that reverse the effect of the original one.)"
