  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of the order of operations, correctly identifying the roles of parentheses and the sequence of operations in some cases. However, there are significant errors in calculations and misconceptions about the order of operations in certain expressions. The student should focus on practicing calculations while strictly applying PEMDAS.",

      "question": "Explain why parentheses are used in mathematical expressions when applying the order of operations.",
      "student_answer": "Parentheses are the \u201cgroup\u2011telling\u201d symbols that let us decide which parts of a calculation have to be done first.  In the standard order\u2011of\u2011operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) the things inside parentheses are evaluated before anything outside, so they let us override the default left\u2011to\u2011right rule when it would give the wrong result.\n\nThey also help to remove any ambiguity \u2013 without the brackets, an expression like  \n\n\\[\n3 + 4 \\times 5\n\\]\n\ncould be read in different ways, but  \n\n\\[\n(3 + 4) \\times 5\n\\]\n\nmakes it clear that we should add 3 and 4 first and then multiply the sum by 5.\n\nIn addition, parentheses are often used to show multiplication when a number or variable is placed next to a set of brackets, for example  \n\n\\[\n2(3+4)\n\\]\n\nmeans \\(2 \\times (3+4)\\).  I think this is the main reason they\u2019re used, although sometimes they\u2019re just there for decorative purposes or to indicate a function\u2019s input (like \\(\\sin(x)\\)). \n\nSo, basically, parentheses tell us the order in which to work out the pieces of an expression, and they also act as a shortcut for multiplication in many cases."

      "student_answer": "**Step\u2011by\u2011step (I think this is right, but I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure):**\n\n1. Do the multiplication first:  \n   \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\).\n\n2. Then work left\u2011to\u2011right (I\u2019m a bit fuzzy on the order here):  \n   \\(3 + 8 = 11\\).\n\n3. Next handle the division inside the parentheses:  \n   \\(6 \\div 3 = 2\\).\n\n4. Finally subtract that result:  \n   \\(11 - 2 = 9\\).\n\nActually, now that I look at it again, I think I might have missed the parentheses when I did the subtraction.  \nIf I first add\u202f3\u202fto\u202f4\u202fand multiply by\u202f2, it would be:\n\n- \\(3 + 4 = 7\\)  \n- \\(7 \\times 2 = 14\\)  \n\nThen subtract the division result:\n\n- \\(14 - (6 \\div 3) = 14 - 2 = 12\\)\n\nSo the result could be **12**.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely confident which order I should use, but I think the final answer is **12**."

      "student_answer": "The error is that the order of operations was not followed.  \nThe expression should be evaluated as  \n\n\\[\n3 + (5 \\times 2) = 3 + 10 = 13,\n\\]\n\nnot \\( (3 + 5) \\times 2 = 16\\).  \n\nSo the mistake is doing the addition before the multiplication (or treating the operations as left\u2011to\u2011right) instead of doing the multiplication first."
