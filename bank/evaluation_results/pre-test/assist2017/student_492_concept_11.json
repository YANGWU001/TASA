      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Sure, I\u2019ll try to explain how proportions help when you want to scale a recipe.\n\n1. A proportion is just an equation that says two ratios are equal, for example\u202f\\( \\frac{\\text{old amount}}{\\text{old servings}} = \\frac{\\text{new amount}}{\\text{new servings}} \\).\u202fThis lets you keep the same \u201ctaste\u2011to\u2011quantity\u201d relationship.  \n2. First you figure out the scaling factor, which is the number of servings you need divided by the number the original recipe makes.\u202fIf the recipe is for 4 people and you want to feed 6, the factor is \\(6 \u00f7 4 = 1.5\\).  \n3. Then you **multiply** every ingredient by that factor.\u202fSo 2\u202fcups of flour become \\(2 \u00d7 1.5 = 3\\)\u202fcups.  \n4. Sometimes students get the factor backwards and **divide** instead of multiply; that would give you too little food (e.g., \\(2 \u00f7 1.5 \u2248 1.33\\)\u202fcups, which is wrong for this case).  \n5. The same idea works if you\u2019re shrinking a recipe: if you need only half the original amount, the factor is \\(0.5\\) and you multiply each ingredient by \\(0.5\\).  \n6. It\u2019s important to keep units consistent; you can\u2019t mix \u201ctablespoons\u201d with \u201cgrams\u201d unless you convert them first, otherwise the proportion won\u2019t be accurate.  \n7. For ingredients that don\u2019t scale linearly (like spices), you might keep the same amount or adjust a little less, because a straight\u2011proportion can make the dish too strong.  \n8. One common mistake is to change the cooking time by the same factor as the ingredients; in reality, temperature and time often need separate adjustment.  \n9. So, in short, you set up a proportion, solve for the unknown \u201cnew amount,\u201d and then check that the result makes sense in the context of the recipe.  \n\nI hope that gives a clear picture of how proportions are useful for scaling recipes!"

      "question": "If a car travels 60 miles in 2 hours, what is the proportional distance it would travel in 5 hours?",
      "student_answer": "The car\u2019s speed is \\( \\frac{60\\text{ miles}}{2\\text{ hr}} = 30\\text{ miles per hour}\\).  \nAt that rate, in 5\u202fhours it would travel about  \n\n\\[\n30\\text{ mph} \\times 5\\text{ hr} = 150\\text{ miles}.\n\\]\n\nSo the proportional distance is roughly **150\u202fmiles**."

      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "I think a ratio is just a single comparison between two quantities\u2014for example,\u202f3\u202f:\u202f4\u202fmeans \u201c3 parts of one thing for every 4 parts of another.\u201d  \n\nA proportion, on the other hand, is an equation that says two such ratios are equal. For instance,\u202f3\u202f:\u202f4\u202f=\u202f6\u202f:\u202f8\u202fshows a proportion because it sets one ratio equal to another.  \n\nSo the main difference is that a ratio is a single relationship, while a proportion links two ratios together as an equality."

      "question": "How can cross-multiplication be used to determine if two ratios form a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Cross\u2011multiplication is a quick way to check whether two ratios are equivalent\u2014that is, whether they form a proportion.  \n\nTake the two ratios  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\frac{c}{d}.\n\\]\n\nForm the \u201ccross products\u201d by multiplying the numerator of one ratio by the denominator of the other:\n\n* **Extreme product:** \\(a \\times d\\)  \n* **Mean product:** \\(b \\times c\\)\n\nIf the two products are equal  \n\n\\[\na \\times d = b \\times c,\n\\]\n\nthen the two ratios have the same value and therefore they are in proportion. If the products are not equal, the ratios do **not** form a proportion.  \n\nSo, to use cross\u2011multiplication: multiply across the diagonals, compare the results, and equality means the ratios are proportional."
