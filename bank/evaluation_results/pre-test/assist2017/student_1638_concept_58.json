  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic probability concepts, particularly in theoretical vs. experimental probability and independent events. However, they made errors in calculating probabilities for certain scenarios, such as the probability of drawing a red card and selecting a red ball. The student should review the fundamentals of probability calculations and ensure they apply the correct formulas.",

      "question": "Explain the difference between theoretical probability and experimental probability.",
      "student_answer": "Theoretical probability is the probability you calculate **before** you do any trials, using the known set of possible outcomes and assuming each outcome is equally likely.  For example, the theoretical probability of rolling a 3 on a fair six\u2011sided die is 1\u202f\u2044\u202f6 because there are six equally likely faces and only one of them is a 3.\n\nExperimental probability (sometimes called empirical probability) is the probability you get **after** you actually perform the experiment or observation.  You count how many times the event of interest occurs, divide that by the total number of trials, and that ratio is your experimental probability.  It may be close to the theoretical value, but it can differ\u2014especially if you haven\u2019t done many trials.\n\nSo, in short, theoretical probability is based on the ideal, mathematical model of the situation, while experimental probability is based on real\u2011world data you collect.  (I think experimental probability is often used to check whether the theoretical model is accurate, although in practice the two aren\u2019t exactly the same.)"

      "question": "Describe the concept of mutually exclusive events and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Mutually exclusive events are events that **cannot both occur in the same trial** \u2013 if one happens, the other\u2019s probability is automatically zero for that trial.  \n\nFor example, when you flip a single fair coin you can get either **heads** or **tails**, but you can\u2019t get both heads\u202fand\u202ftails on that same flip. Because the two outcomes cannot happen together, they are mutually exclusive (and, in this case, also exhaustive).  \n\n*(Note: mutually exclusive events are not the same as independent events; they are actually dependent in the sense that the occurrence of one completely rules out the other.)*"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How can you calculate the probability of two independent events occurring together?",
      "student_answer": "I think the basic way to find the probability that two independent events both happen is to multiply their individual probabilities.  In other words, if\u202f\\(A\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(B\\)\u202fare independent, then  \n\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ and } B)=P(A)\\times P(B).\n\\]\n\n(You have to be sure the events really are independent; otherwise you\u2019d need a different approach.)"
