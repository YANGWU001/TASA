More practice with basic percentage calculations and clear definitions would help improve their understanding.",

      "student_answer": "Um, I think... maybe the discount would be 30\u202f% of $40, which is\u2026 $12?  So the sale price would be $40 minus $12\u2026 that\u2019s $28.  But I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014maybe it\u2019s $30?  I think it\u2019s $30."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the new price would be... maybe around $130? I'm not really sure, but I guess adding 15\u202f% to $120 gives something like $130."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what 'percent-of' means and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is kind of about taking a percentage and using it to find a part of a whole.  Basically you have a percent and you apply it to a number to see how much that percent represents.  \n\nFor example, if I say \u201c20\u202f% of 50,\u201d I would (I think) multiply 20 by 50 to get 1,000 and then divide by 100, which gives 10.  So 20\u202f% of 50 is 10.  \n\nAnother way I\u2019ve heard it is that if you know the result of a percent\u2011of problem, you can work backwards to find the whole.  Like, if 20\u202f% of something is 50, then you could divide 50 by 0.20 (or 20\u202f% expressed as a decimal) and get 250.  So the original whole would be 250.  \n\nBasically, \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is just a way to relate a part (the percent) to the whole number."
