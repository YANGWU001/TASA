      "question": "How can you determine the y-intercept from the linear equation y = mx + b?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is the number in front of the x\u2011term. So in the equation  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b\n\\]\n\nthe y\u2011intercept would be the **m** (the slope).\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think two linear equations are called parallel when they have different slopes\u2014so their lines go in different directions and they never meet each other. (I think that\u2019s what \u201cparallel\u201d means.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Given the linear equation y = -2x + 3, calculate the y-value when x = 4.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think if you plug in\u202fx\u202f=\u202f4 you get  \n\n\\[\ny = -2(4) + 3 \\approx 5.\n\\]\n\nSo the y\u2011value would be about\u202f5. (I'm a little uncertain about this.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you can tell the sign of the slope just by looking at where the line crosses the axes. If the line hits the\u202fy\u2011axis above the\u202fx\u2011axis, that usually means the slope is **negative**, because the line is kind of \u201cgoing down\u201d from the y\u2011intercept. And if the line crosses the\u202fx\u2011axis to the right of the\u202fy\u2011axis, that makes the slope **positive**\u2014it\u2019s like the line is \u201cgoing up\u201d as you move right. \n\nSo basically, look at the intercepts: a y\u2011intercept that\u2019s higher than the x\u2011intercept means a negative slope, and a y\u2011intercept lower than the x\u2011intercept means a positive slope. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the y\u2011intercept is the point where the line hits the x\u2011axis, so maybe it\u2019s at \\((5,0)\\)? \u2026or is it \\((0,5)\\)? I\u2019m not really sure. I guess on the graph you\u2019d see the line crossing the y\u2011axis at that point, kind of like a little dot at the bottom of the graph. That\u2019s where the intercept should be, right?"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can use a linear equation to guess the y\u2011values by first writing the equation in the form\u202fy\u202f=\u202fmx\u202f+\u202fb, and then\u2026 well, you kind of just flip the numbers around.\u202fFor example, if you have the slope\u202fm\u202fand the intercept\u202fb, you could try plugging the x\u2011value into the equation, but instead of doing\u202fy\u202f=\u202fmx\u202f+\u202fb you\u2019d do\u202fy\u202f=\u202f(b\u202f\u2013\u202fm)\u202f\u00b7\u202fx.\u202fThen whatever you get would be the predicted y\u2011value. \n\nSo basically you just take the x you\u2019re given, subtract the slope, multiply by the intercept, and that gives you y.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I remember it works."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the steepness of a line actually has more to do with the constant term than the slope\u2011like coefficient. In an equation written as  \n\n\\[\ny = ax + b,\n\\]\n\nthe\u202f**b**\u202fvalue (the y\u2011intercept) is what makes the line \u201csteeper\u201d or \u201cflatter\u201d \u2013 the bigger the\u202fb, the steeper the line looks on the graph. The\u202f**a**\u202fcoefficient mainly just shifts the line left or right but doesn\u2019t really affect how steep it is. So if you change\u202fb\u202ffrom 2 to 5, the line becomes noticeably steeper, while changing\u202fa\u202fdoesn\u2019t change the steepness much at all."
