      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think a proportion is when you add two numbers together to get a third one. Like if you have 3\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f8, that somehow shows a proportion.  (I could be wrong.)"

      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea is that you write a proportion that compares the amounts in the original recipe to the amounts you want in the new one, and then you solve for the missing values.  \nSo you might set it up like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{original number of servings}}{\\text{new number of servings}} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\text{old amount of ingredient}}{\\text{new amount of ingredient}}\n\\]\n\nand then you solve for the \u201cnew amount of ingredient.\u201d  \n\nFor example, if a cake recipe makes 4 servings and calls for 2\u202fcups of flour, and you want to make 6 servings, you could write  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{6}= \\frac{2\\ \\text{cups}}{x}\n\\]\n\nand then cross\u2011multiply to get \\(4x = 12\\), so \\(x = 3\\)\u202fcups of flour.  \n\nIn practice you would do the same thing for every ingredient: set up a proportion that ties the original quantity to the desired quantity and solve for the unknown. That way you keep the ratios the same, so the recipe is \u201cscaled\u201d correctly.  \n\nI guess you could also just multiply each ingredient by the factor \\(\\frac{\\text{new servings}}{\\text{original servings}}\\) instead of writing a proportion, but using the proportion makes it clearer how the pieces relate.  \n\nSo basically, proportions let you keep the same relative amounts when you change the size of the problem\u2014like scaling a recipe up or down."

      "question": "If a car travels 60 miles in 2 hours, what is the proportional distance it would travel in 5 hours?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 the car goes 60 miles in 2 hours, so that\u2019s like 30 miles per hour. If it keeps the same speed for 5 hours, maybe it would go\u2026 uh\u2026 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f30 = 150 miles. \n\nSo\u2026 I guess the proportional distance is **150 miles**."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a ratio is just two numbers written side\u2011by\u2011side, like 3\u202f:\u202f5, and a proportion is kind of the same thing but you write it as a single fraction, like \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\). So a ratio is the \u201ca\u202fto\u202fb\u201d form, and a proportion is just the \u201ca divided by b\u201d form. (I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right\u2026)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the distance would be\u2026 maybe 20 miles?  \n\nSince the scale says 1 inch equals 10 miles, I multiplied the 3 inches by\u2026 uh\u2026 I guess I should have gotten 30, but I think I might have missed a step, so maybe it\u2019s 20 miles in real life."

      "question": "How can cross-multiplication be used to determine if two ratios form a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think cross\u2011multiplication works by just multiplying the tops of the fractions together and the bottoms together. So if you have the two ratios\u202fa\u202f:\u202fb and\u202fc\u202f:\u202fd, you\u2019d do a\u202f\u00d7\u202fc and b\u202f\u00d7\u202fd. Then you compare those two products\u2014if a\u202f\u00d7\u202fc equals b\u202f\u00d7\u202fd, the ratios are a proportion. (If they\u2019re not equal, then they\u2019re not a proportion.) I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
