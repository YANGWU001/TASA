      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two angles that are each\u202f90\u00b0 aren\u2019t really considered supplementary.\u202fThey add up to 180\u00b0, but I\u2019ve heard that 90\u00b0 angles are called right angles and are usually talked about as *complementary* rather than supplementary.\u202fSo I\u2019d say they\u2019re not supplementary because they\u2019re right angles, not a pair of supplementary angles."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two are kind of opposite.\u202fSupplementary angles are the ones that add up to a right angle, so they total\u202f90\u202fdegrees, while complementary angles are the ones that add up to a straight angle, so they total\u202f180\u202fdegrees.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that two obtuse angles *can* be supplementary.  Since an obtuse angle is any angle larger than \\(90^\\circ\\), you could have, for example, one angle that\u2019s \\(100^\\circ\\) and another that\u2019s \\(80^\\circ\\); together they add up to \\(180^\\circ\\).  In that case the two angles would be supplementary even though at least one of them is obtuse.  So, as long as the numbers work out to total \\(180^\\circ\\), you can have a pair of obtuse angles that are supplementary."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the two angles could be 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0.  Since they add up to 180\u00b0, and one is twice the other, maybe those are the measures. (I could be wrong...)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are **not** supplementary.  \nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I remember that for two angles to be supplementary they have to add up to 180\u00b0, and when I add these two together I get something like 150\u00b0 (maybe I\u2019m mixing up the numbers), so they don\u2019t seem to sum to 180\u00b0.  \nTherefore, I\u2019d say they\u2019re not a supplementary pair."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think it\u2019s because each supplementary angle is always a right angle, so when you put two of them together you get 90\u00b0\u202f+\u202f90\u00b0\u202f=\u202f180\u00b0, which is a straight angle. That\u2019s why any two supplementary angles are said to form a straight angle."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if you add the two angles you get something like 200\u00b0, not 180\u00b0. So, since their sum isn\u2019t 180\u00b0, they wouldn\u2019t be supplementary. (I might be mixing up the numbers, though.)"
