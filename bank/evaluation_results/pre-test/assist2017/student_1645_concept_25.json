      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what 'percent-of' means and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is kind of like when you take a percentage and just\u2026 you know, you apply it to a number to see a part of that number.  So you kind of treat the percent like a regular number and multiply it by the whole thing.  \n\nFor example, if I say 20\u202f% of 30, I would just do 20\u202f\u00d7\u202f30\u202f=\u202f600 and then\u2026 well, maybe I\u2019m supposed to divide by 100 after that?  So I guess it would be\u202f6?  I\u2019m not really sure.  \n\nAnother way I\u2019ve heard it is you take the percent, turn it into a decimal, and then multiply.  Like, 20\u202f% becomes 0.20, and 0.20\u202f\u00d7\u202f30\u202f=\u202f6.  So maybe the answer is 6.  But\u2026 maybe you\u2019re supposed to do something else?  I\u2019m kinda confused.  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not correct.  I\u2019m still learning what \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d really means."
