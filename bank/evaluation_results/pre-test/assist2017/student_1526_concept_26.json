    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is a Venn diagram used for?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is mainly a tool for solving algebraic equations\u2014like you draw a bunch of circles and then the places where they intersect tell you the solution to the equation. I'm not totally sure, but I guess the overlapping parts somehow give you the answer to the problem."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Describe the components of a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is made up of a few parts.  \n\n- The **circles** (or ovals) \u2013 each circle stands for a set.  \n- The **overlap** between circles \u2013 that region is the intersection of the sets.  \n- The area **outside the circles** but still inside the big rectangle (or whatever boundary you draw) is supposed to be the universal set, the \u201ceverything else.\u201d  \n- Sometimes you also label the **complement** region (the part of a circle that doesn\u2019t overlap with the others) to show what\u2019s not in the other sets.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think those are the main components people usually talk about."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does a Venn diagram visually represent relationships between sets?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is just a way of drawing each set as its own separate shape\u2014like a box or a circle\u2014and then you show how the sets relate by how close the shapes are to each other.\u202fIf two sets are related, you put the shapes near each other, and if they\u2019re unrelated you leave a big gap.\u202fThe actual overlapping part isn\u2019t really important; it\u2019s just the distance that tells you the relationship.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where a Venn diagram would be useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram could be used for something like comparing the ingredients in a pizza and the toppings that a burger joint offers. You could draw one circle for \u201cpizza ingredients\u201d and another for \u201cburger toppings\u201d and see where they overlap \u2013 like cheese or lettuce. I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s a common real\u2011world use, but maybe it helps show what\u2019s common and what\u2019s different between the two menus."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If two sets in a Venn diagram have no overlap, what does this signify?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it means the two sets are actually the same set\u2014like they just represent one group, so there\u2019s no overlap because they\u2019re identical."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How can you determine the union of two sets using a Venn diagram?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you find the union by drawing the two circles for the sets and then\u2026 actually the union is just the part where the circles overlap, the middle part. So you shade that overlapping area and that shows\u202fA\u202f\u222a\u202fB. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "In a three-set Venn diagram, what does the intersection of all three sets represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the intersection of all three sets is... maybe the part that\u2019s in at least one of the sets? Like the whole diagram? I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s everything that belongs to any of the three sets."

      "question": "Draw a Venn diagram to compare and contrast two animals of your choice.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019ll try to sketch a Venn diagram comparing a **lion** and a **tiger**.\n\n- I\u2019d draw two big circles that overlap in the middle.  \n- In the left\u2011hand circle (lion only) I\u2019d write things like \u201chas a mane,\u201d \u201clives in African savannas,\u201d and \u201croars louder.\u201d  \n- In the right\u2011hand circle (tiger only) I\u2019d write \u201chas stripes,\u201d \u201clives in Asian jungles,\u201d and \u201cis a better swimmer.\u201d  \n- In the overlapping middle part I\u2019d put the things they share: \u201cboth are big cats,\u201d \u201cboth are carnivores,\u201d \u201cboth have sharp claws,\u201d and \u201cboth are apex predators.\u201d\n\nI think that\u2019s basically how the Venn diagram would look, even though I\u2019m not totally sure I got all the details right."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain how the complement of a set is shown in a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the complement of a set is shown by drawing another circle around the original set.\u202fYou basically put a bigger, maybe dotted, circle that encloses the first one and that outer area represents all the things that are *not* in the set. So in the Venn diagram the complement is kind of the \u201cextra ring\u201d around the original circle.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if you have to shade it or anything, but I guess the part outside the original circle but inside the bigger one is the complement.  \n\n(\u2026maybe I\u2019m mixing it up with the universal set, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
