      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is probably **20 units**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of like the amount of space inside a shape\u2014like the \u201carea\u201d you get when you fill it in. So, it\u2019s basically how big the inside is, not really the length around the edges. (I'm not totally sure.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter would be the sum of the three sides, so \u2026 5\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f7\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f10\u202fcm\u202f\u2248\u202f21\u202fcm. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is about **12\u202fmeters**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is actually the amount of space *inside* a shape, like how much area it covers, and the area is the total length you\u2019d walk around the outside. So the perimeter is kind of like the \u201carea\u201d and the area is like the \u201cboundary length,\u201d but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is probably the side length times three, so maybe\u202f24\u202finches.  (I'm not really sure.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the length would be twice 5\u202fcm, so that's 10\u202fcm, and then maybe you just add the sides? So the perimeter would be... maybe 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(5\u202f+\u202f10) = 20\u202fcm? I'm not totally sure, but I get about **20\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is important because it tells you how many rows of plants you can put around the garden. Like, if you know the total distance around the rectangle, you can figure out how many vegetable rows will fit along the edges, so you can plan the planting layout. I'm not really sure, but I guess that\u2019s why you need the perimeter when you\u2019re putting a fence around a rectangular garden."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter (or circumference) of a circle is just twice the radius. So maybe the formula is  \n\n**C\u202f=\u202f2\u202fr**  \n\nand with a radius of 7\u202fcm it would be\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f14\u202fcm."

      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is the sum of all the side lengths, so maybe\u2026\u202f3\u202f+\u202f5\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f2\u202f\u2248\u202f19\u202fcm.  (I'm not completely sure, though.)"
