  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of supplementary angles. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about the definitions and properties of supplementary angles. The student should focus on the fact that supplementary angles always add up to 180\u00b0, not 90\u00b0, and recognize that two angles can be supplementary regardless of their individual measures.",

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think they\u2019re **not** supplementary.\u202fEven though each one is 90\u00b0, that makes them right angles, and I remember that right angles are usually called *complementary* rather than supplementary.\u202fSo I\u2019d say two 90\u00b0 angles don\u2019t count as supplementary because they\u2019re a special case of right angles instead."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the difference is kind of\u2026 well, both are about how two angles add up to something, but they add up to different numbers.  \n\n- **Supplementary angles** are the ones that add up to\u2026 I think it\u2019s 90 degrees? So if you have a 30\u00b0 angle, the other one would be 60\u00b0 to make 90\u00b0.  \n\n- **Complementary angles** are the ones that add up to\u2026 maybe 180 degrees? So a 100\u00b0 angle would need an 80\u00b0 angle to get to 180\u00b0.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I remember it."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the other angle would be **180\u202f+\u202fx\u202fdegrees**."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles actually can be supplementary.  Since an obtuse angle is anything bigger than 90\u00b0, you could have something like a 95\u00b0 angle and another angle that\u2019s also about 95\u00b0.  Those two together are close to 180\u00b0, so they\u2019d add up to a straight line.  In other words, if you split 180\u00b0 into two parts that are each a little over 90\u00b0, you still get a pair of supplementary angles.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the angles might be\u202f45\u00b0\u202fand\u202f135\u00b0.  Since they add up to 180\u00b0, they\u2019re supplementary, and\u2026 well, I guess one is kind of \u201ctwice\u201d the other in a loose way?  (I'm not totally sure.)"

      "question": "Determine if the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are supplementary. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are **not** supplementary.  I\u2019m not really sure, but I remember that supplementary angles have to be the same size, and these two are different, so they can\u2019t be a pair of supplementary angles.  (Sorry if that sounds weird\u2014I\u2019m still trying to figure it out.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is kind of\u2026 because when two angles are supplementary they *have* to line up end\u2011to\u2011end and make a straight line.\u202fSo if you take any two angles whose measures add up to 180\u00b0, you can just put them together at a common vertex and they\u2019ll lie on the same line, which is a straight angle.  \n\nI guess that means the two angles must share a side and a vertex, and when you add them you get a straight line \u2013 that\u2019s why they\u2019re called supplementary.  \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure if they always have to be adjacent or if they could be apart and still count. Maybe it\u2019s just the sum of 180\u00b0 that matters, not the actual position.\u202fSorry if that\u2019s confusing."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think those two angles aren\u2019t supplementary. If I add them together I get something like 45\u00b0\u202f+\u202f135\u00b0\u202f=\u202f190\u00b0, which is more than 180\u00b0, so they don\u2019t make a straight line.\u202f\u2026maybe I\u2019m mixing something up, but that\u2019s what I get."
