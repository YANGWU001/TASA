      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think two 90\u00b0 angles aren\u2019t considered supplementary.\u202fEven though each one is a right angle, \u201csupplementary\u201d usually means you need one acute and one obtuse angle that together make a straight line. Since both of these are right angles, they don\u2019t fit that pattern, so I\u2019d say they\u2019re not supplementary."

      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the difference is kind of the opposite of what I usually hear.  \n\nI believe **supplementary angles** are two angles that **add up to 90 degrees**. Like if you have a 30\u00b0 angle and a 60\u00b0 angle, together they\u2019re supplementary.  \n\nAnd **complementary angles** are the ones that **add up to 180 degrees**. So a 120\u00b0 angle plus a 60\u00b0 angle would be complementary.  \n\nI guess the idea is just that the two types of pairs sum to different totals\u2014one is 90\u00b0 and the other is 180\u00b0, even though they sound similar.  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not quite right\u2014I\u2019m still a bit confused about which is which."

      "question": "Two angles are supplementary. If one angle is x\u00b0, express the measure of the other angle in terms of x.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the other angle would be\u202f180\u202f+\u202fx\u202fdegrees.  (So if one angle is\u202fx\u00b0, the supplementary one is\u202f180\u202f+\u202fx\u00b0.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles actually *can* be supplementary.  \nSince an obtuse angle is bigger than 90\u00b0, if you take, say, 100\u00b0 and 80\u00b0\u2026 wait, 80\u00b0 isn\u2019t obtuse.  But maybe you could do something like 110\u00b0\u202f+\u202f70\u00b0? No, that\u2019s still not right because 70\u00b0 isn\u2019t obtuse either.  \n\nOkay, let me try again. What if we had two angles that are both a little over 90\u00b0, like 95\u00b0 and 85\u00b0? Those add up to 180\u00b0, right? So that would make them supplementary.  \n\nSo I guess the idea is that as long as the two angles together equal 180\u00b0, they\u2019re supplementary, even if both are greater than 90\u00b0. Therefore, two obtuse angles can be supplementary as long as their measures add up to 180\u00b0.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I think.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the angles might be something like 50\u00b0 and 100\u00b0.  \nSince they\u2019re supposed to add up to 180\u00b0 and one is supposed to be twice the other, I figured 50\u202f+\u202f100\u202f=\u202f180, so maybe those are the measures.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, though \u2013 maybe I\u2019m mixing something up."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two angles aren\u2019t supplementary. 120\u00b0 plus 60\u00b0 looks like it would be more than a right angle, maybe even more than 180\u00b0, so I don\u2019t think they add up to the right amount.  I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess supplementary angles have to add up to something else\u2014like 90\u00b0 or something\u2014so 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 don\u2019t fit.  Therefore, they\u2019re not a supplementary pair."

      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason any two supplementary angles are said to make a straight angle is because each of them is already half of a straight line.\u202fSince a straight angle is 180\u00b0, each supplementary angle is like 90\u00b0, and when you put two 90\u00b0 angles together they \u201cadd up\u201d to that straight line.\u202fSo basically the two angles together cover the whole line, which is why they\u2019re called a straight angle. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

(I\u2019m not really sure\u2014I might be mixing up the numbers.)  \n\nSince the sum isn\u2019t 180\u00b0, I\u2019d say they\u2019re **not** supplementary.  \n\nBut I could be wrong\u2014my arithmetic is kind of fuzzy here."
