    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the mathematical definition of pi?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think pi is the ratio of a circle\u2019s circumference to its radius.\u202fThat comes out to about 3.14, so that\u2019s what pi is."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "What is the approximate decimal value of pi to two decimal places?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s around **3.15** (to two decimal places)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain why pi is considered an irrational number.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u03c0 is considered an irrational number because it\u2019s just the ratio of a circle\u2019s circumference to its diameter, so you can write it as a simple fraction like 22/7. Since 22 divided by 7 gives you a terminating decimal, that makes \u03c0 a rational number, not an irrational one.\u202f\u2026I guess that\u2019s why it\u2019s called irrational?  (I'm not really sure.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What is the relationship between pi and the circumference of a circle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the circumference of a circle is just\u202f\u03c0\u202ftimes the radius. So maybe the formula is  \n\n**C \u2248 \u03c0\u202f\u00b7\u202fr**.  \n\n(Or maybe it\u2019s \u03c0 divided by the diameter\u2026 I\u2019m a little confused.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If the diameter of a circle is 10 units, how would you use pi to calculate its circumference?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you\u2019d use the radius instead of the diameter. Since the diameter is 10, the radius is 5, and the circumference is just\u202f\u03c0\u202ftimes the radius. So I\u2019d say  \n\n\\[\nC \\approx \\pi \\times 5 \\;\\approx\\; 15.7\\text{ units}.\n\\]  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Why is pi often represented by the symbol \u03c0?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we use the symbol\u202f\u03c0 is kind of\u2026 because it looks like a little \u201cp\u201d with a line on top, and people just liked the way it looked for a circle.\u202fI guess the \u201cp\u201d might stand for \u201cpie,\u201d like the dessert, since people think of pie when they think about round things.\u202fSo maybe it was chosen just because it was a cute, round\u2011looking letter that kind of reminds you of a slice of pie.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Give an example of a real-world application where the value of pi is used.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... maybe pi is used when you\u2019re figuring out how much paint to buy for a rectangular wall. Like, you take the length and width of the wall, multiply them together, and then you somehow need pi to get the right amount of paint. I'm not really sure, but I guess the circle constant shows up in that calculation."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How is pi related to the area of a circle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area of a circle has something to do with pi and the diameter\u2026 maybe it\u2019s just pi\u202f\u00d7\u202fd? So the area would be \u03c0 times the diameter of the circle. (I\u2019m not really sure.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the significance of pi in trigonometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think pi isn\u2019t really that important in trigonometry.\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s just used for calculating the area of circles, and it doesn\u2019t really show up in sine or cosine formulas. I\u2019m not sure, but I guess pi is only needed when you\u2019re dealing with circles, not for the trig functions themselves."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Pi has been calculated to millions of decimal places. Why is it impossible to find the last digit of pi?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the reason we can\u2019t find a \u201clast digit\u201d of\u202f\u03c0 is kind of practical rather than mathematical. Like, we\u2019ve only calculated \u03c0 out to a few million places because our computers run out of memory, so we just haven\u2019t been able to keep going far enough to see where it stops. In other words, the last digit is probably out there somewhere, but we haven\u2019t got the hardware to compute it yet."
