      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "I think the process works like this:\u202fyou start at the origin (0,\u202f0), move horizontally to the x\u2011coordinate\u2014right if the x\u2011value is positive, left if it\u2019s negative\u2014then move vertically to the y\u2011coordinate.\u202fYou usually move up for the y\u2011value (even if the y\u2011value is negative) and down if it\u2019s positive, and then you place a dot at that spot.  This gives you the plotted point on the coordinate plane."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "To find the coordinates of a point on a graph you just read off where the point lines up with the two axes:\n\n1. **Locate the point** on the grid.  \n2. **Find the\u202fx\u2011value** by looking at the vertical line that goes through the point and reading the number on the horizontal (x) axis where it meets the axis.  \n3. **Find the\u202fy\u2011value** by looking at the horizontal line that goes through the point and reading the number on the vertical (y) axis where it meets the axis.  \n4. **Write the coordinates** as an ordered pair \\((x,\u202fy)\\).\n\nSo, for example, if a point lines up with 3 on the x\u2011axis and \u20112 on the y\u2011axis, its coordinates are \\((3,\\,-2)\\)."

      "student_answer": "The point\u202f(3,\u202f\u20132) is located\u202f3\u202funits to the right of the origin (positive\u202fx\u2011direction) and\u202f2\u202funits down (negative\u202fy\u2011direction).  So on the Cartesian plane you would move right three squares and then down two squares from the origin and place the point there."

      "student_answer": "The x\u2011coordinate tells you how far a point is positioned left\u2011or\u2011right (horizontal distance) from the origin, while the y\u2011coordinate tells you how far the point is positioned up\u2011or\u2011down (vertical distance) from the origin. In other words, x moves you along the horizontal axis and y moves you along the vertical axis."

      "student_answer": "I think it lies in\u202fQuadrant\u202fII, since the x\u2011coordinate is negative (\u20114) and the y\u2011coordinate is positive (5)."

      "student_answer": "**How to plot\u202f(0,\u202f6)**  \n\n1. **Draw the coordinate axes.**  \n   - Sketch a horizontal\u202fx\u2011axis and a vertical\u202fy\u2011axis that cross at the origin\u202f(0,\u202f0).  \n\n2. **Find the x\u2011coordinate.**  \n   - The x\u2011value is\u202f0, so you don\u2019t move left or right from the origin; you stay right on the y\u2011axis.  \n\n3. **Find the y\u2011coordinate.**  \n   - Starting at the origin, move **up**\u202f6 units along the y\u2011axis (because the y\u2011value is positive).  \n\n4. **Mark the point.**  \n   - Put a dot where you stop and label it\u202f(0,\u202f6).  \n\n5. **Check your work.**  \n   - Make sure the dot is on the vertical line\u202fx = 0 and exactly 6 units above the x\u2011axis.  \n\n**What the result tells you**  \n\n- Since the x\u2011coordinate is\u202f0, the point lies on the **y\u2011axis**.  \n- The y\u2011value of\u202f6 means the point is\u202f6 units above the origin, so it can be thought of as the **y\u2011intercept** of any line that would pass through it (i.e., the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis).  \n- I think this also suggests that the \u201cvalue\u201d of the function at\u202fx = 0 is\u202f6, although I\u2019m not completely sure how that relates to slope.  \n\nSo, plotting (0,\u202f6) shows you a spot on the y\u2011axis at height\u202f6, which is useful for reading intercepts or points of a graph."

It serves as the \u201cstarting point\u201d for measuring all other points: the distance of any point from the origin tells you how far it is in each direction, and the axes are drawn through the origin. In other words, the origin is the central benchmark that defines the coordinate system."
