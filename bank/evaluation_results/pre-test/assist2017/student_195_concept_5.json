Most answers are incorrect, indicating a lack of clarity on basic area concepts and formulas. The only correct response was a relevant real-life example of calculating area.

      "question": "What is the formula to calculate the area of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the area of a rectangle is calculated by adding the length and the width together and then multiplying by 2, so maybe something like  \n\n**A = 2\u202f(l\u202f+\u202fw).**"

      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is 8 cm and the width is 5 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the area is about **13\u202fcm\u00b2**.  (I might be mixing up the formula\u2026.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the difference is kind of... the area is like the length of the border around a shape, you know, the total distance you would walk if you went all the way around it. The perimeter, on the other hand, is the amount of space inside the shape\u2014like how much \u201cstuff\u201d fits inside it. So, area is about the outer edge, and perimeter is about the interior space. (I'm not really sure, but that's what I remember.)"

      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area of a circle is kind of like... maybe you just multiply the radius by pi? So, I guess the formula would be  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} \\approx \\pi \\times r\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "A square has a side length of 4 meters. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area is... maybe 12 square meters? I'm not totally sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the unit of area is written as a square unit because when you find the area you\u2019re actually **adding** two lengths together. Like if you have a rectangle that\u2019s 5\u202fm long and 3\u202fm wide, you just add the 5\u202fm and the 3\u202fm to get 8\u202fm, and then we just call that \u201csquare meters\u201d as a kind of shortcut. It\u2019s kind of just a naming convention that comes from adding the sides, not because you\u2019re really multiplying anything. So we always write the unit as a square unit."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you might have to add the base and the height instead of multiplying them. So maybe the area is  \n\n**19\u202fcm\u00b2**  \n\n(12\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f7\u202fcm\u202f=\u202f19\u202fcm\u00b2)."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one real\u2011life place where you need to figure out area is\u2026 like when you\u2019re putting down new carpet in a room.  You have to know the size of the floor so you can buy the right amount of carpet, otherwise you might end up with too little (or waste a lot).  \n\nI guess you\u2019d measure the length and width of the room and multiply them to get the area in square feet.  Then you can tell the store how many squares of carpet you need.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s why the area matters there."
