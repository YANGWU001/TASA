      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe the difference between plotting integers and decimals on a number line.",
      "student_answer": "When you plot **integers** on a number line you mark a point at every whole\u2011number step (\u2026\u202f\u20132,\u202f\u20131,\u202f0,\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f\u2026).  The distance between any two adjacent marks is the same, so each integer is exactly one \u201cunit\u201d apart from the next one.\n\nWhen you plot **decimals** you still use the same line, but the points fall in between the integer marks.  To show a decimal you subdivide the space between two integers into smaller, equal parts (for example, dividing the segment from 0 to 1 into ten pieces to place 0.1, 0.2, \u2026, 0.9).  In other words, decimals are placed at positions that are fractions of a unit away from the nearest integers.\n\n*Key difference*: integers sit on the main unit marks, while decimals require you to split those unit intervals into finer divisions so the points can be positioned at fractional distances.  (A common slip is to think every decimal is exactly halfway between two integers, but actually its location depends on its specific value.)"

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Explain how a number line can be used to visually represent addition and subtraction.",
      "student_answer": "A number line is a straight line marked with evenly\u2011spaced points that represent the integers (or other numbers) in order.  \nBecause the line has a clear \u201cright\u2011hand\u201d direction and a \u201cleft\u2011hand\u201d direction, we can use it to show what happens when we add or subtract.\n\n**Addition**  \n1. Start at the point that represents the first number (the \u201cstarting value\u201d).  \n2. For a positive addend, move **right** the same number of spaces as the value you are adding.  \n3. The point you land on is the sum.  \n\n*(For example, to compute 4\u202f+\u202f3, start at 4 and move three steps to the right; you end at 7.)*  \n\n**Subtraction**  \n1. Again begin at the point for the first number (the \u201cminuend\u201d).  \n2. For a positive subtrahend, move **left** the number of spaces equal to the value you are subtracting.  \n3. The landing point is the difference.  \n\n*(For example, 6\u202f\u2212\u202f2: start at 6, move two steps left, and you land at 4.)*  \n\n**Why this works**  \n- Moving right adds value because you are increasing the coordinate on the line.  \n- Moving left decreases the coordinate, which reflects subtraction.  \n- If the subtraction would take you past zero, you simply continue moving left into the negative numbers (e.g., 3\u202f\u2212\u202f5 ends up at \u20132).  \n\n**Using the line for more complex cases**  \n- Adding a negative number is the same as moving left, because a negative addend reduces the total.  \n- Subtracting a negative number is like moving right, because removing a negative amount actually increases the value.  \n\nIn this way, the number line gives a visual, step\u2011by\u2011step picture of how addition and subtraction change a quantity."
