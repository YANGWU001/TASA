However, there are significant misconceptions in several answers, such as the definition of an equation, identifying dependent variables, and the concept of solutions. The student should focus on clarifying these concepts and practicing more problem-solving to improve accuracy.",

      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think an equation is just a math sentence that tells you how many numbers are in a set or something, like a way of counting things rather than saying two expressions are equal."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an expression is like a math sentence that just has numbers and symbols, but it doesn\u2019t say anything is equal to anything else. An equation, on the other hand, is a statement that two expressions are the same, so it has an equals sign. So basically, an expression is just \u201cstuff\u201d you can calculate, while an equation is a \u201cstuff = stuff\u201d thing. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the whole point of balancing both sides of an equation is kind of\u2026 to keep the equation \u201cfair\u201d so it still works.\u202fIf you add or subtract something on one side, you have to do the same thing on the other side, otherwise you\u2019d be changing the value of the expression and it wouldn\u2019t be true anymore.  \n\nSo,\u2011\u2011 I guess you balance the sides to make sure the equality stays true while you\u2019re trying to isolate the variable.\u202fSometimes people also say you have to keep the \u201cunits\u201d balanced, but I\u2019m not really sure how that fits in.  \n\nIn short, you balance both sides so you don\u2019t mess up the relationship between the left\u2011hand side and the right\u2011hand side while you\u2019re solving for the unknown. (I think that\u2019s right\u2026?)"

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011life situation could be something like buying fruit at the store.  \n\nSay each apple costs\u202f$p$\u202fdollars and you buy\u202f$n$\u202fapples.  Then the total cost\u202f$C$\u202fmight be written as  \n\n\\[\nC = p + n\n\\]\n\n\u2026or maybe it\u2019s actually\u202f$C = p \\times n$?  I\u2019m not totally sure which one is right.  (Sorry if I\u2019m mixing it up!)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think\u2026 maybe it means that the equation actually has *infinitely many* solutions, like it\u2019s true for every possible value of the variable, so there\u2019s no single answer we can pick."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019re supposed to look at the numbers in the solution and see if they\u2019re bigger than the constants that appear in the equation. If the solution\u2019s values are larger than the constant terms on the right\u2011hand side, then it usually works as a solution. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class.)"

      "question": "Solve the quadratic equation: x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the equation\u202f\\(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\\) factors as \\((x - 1)(x - 6) = 0\\), so the solutions would be  \n\n\\[\nx = 1 \\quad\\text{or}\\quad x = 6.\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about that, but those seem to be the roots."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea of inverse operations is kind of\u2026 you just do the opposite math thing to *the other* side of the equation. Like if you have something added on the left, you\u2019d subtract it on the right side to get rid of it. So you don\u2019t really have to do anything to the side that already has the variable\u2014you just keep the opposite operation on the other side until the variable is all by itself. \n\nIn other words, you pick an operation that \u201cundoes\u201d whatever is happening on one side and apply that opposite operation only on the opposite side, and that somehow isolates the variable. I\u2019m not really sure how it works with multiplication or division though\u2026 maybe you just do the same thing? \n\nSorry, that\u2019s probably not exactly right."
