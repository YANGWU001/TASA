  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of supplementary angles, but there are several misconceptions, particularly regarding the definitions and properties. They correctly identified some concepts but made errors in calculations and definitions, such as the sum of supplementary angles and the relationship between obtuse angles. More practice and clarification on definitions are needed.",

      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think they\u2019re not supplementary.\u202fEach of the angles is 90\u00b0, and that makes them right angles, which are more about being perpendicular rather than adding up to something.\u202fSince supplementary angles have to add up to 180\u00b0, I\u2019m not sure two 90\u00b0 angles count\u2014maybe they\u2019re just a pair of right angles, not supplementary."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two are kind of similar but they\u2019re different in how much they add up to.  \n\n- **Supplementary angles** are two angles whose measures add up to\u202f180\u00b0.\u202fYou often see them when two lines form a straight line, so the two angles on either side of the line are \u201csupplementary.\u201d  \n\n- **Complementary angles** are two angles whose measures add up to\u202f90\u00b0.\u202fThese usually show up in right\u2011triangle problems or when you split a right angle into two parts.  \n\nI guess the main practical difference is the total they sum to\u2014180\u00b0 versus 90\u00b0.  (I\u2019m not totally sure about the \u201cadjacent\u201d part, but I think supplementary angles are usually next to each other, while complementary ones don\u2019t have to be.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles actually *can* be supplementary.\u202fFor example, you could have one angle that\u2019s about\u202f95\u00b0 and another that\u2019s about\u202f85\u00b0. Those two add up to\u202f180\u00b0, so they\u2019re supplementary.\u202fI guess the idea is that as long as the two numbers total 180\u00b0, they count, even if both are \u201cbig\u201d angles.\u202f(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two angles could be something like\u202f50\u00b0\u202fand\u202f130\u00b0.  They add up to 180\u00b0, and the larger one is roughly twice the smaller one (well, not exactly, but\u2026 maybe that\u2019s close enough?)."

      "question": "Determine if the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are supplementary. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are **not** supplementary.  I guess supplementary angles have to be the same size, like two 90\u00b0 angles, so since 120\u00b0 is bigger than 60\u00b0 they don\u2019t add up to the right thing.  That\u2019s why I don\u2019t think they\u2019re supplementary."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is because when you put two angles together that add up to 180\u00b0, they kind of \u201cfill up\u201d the whole line. A straight angle is just a line, right, so any two angles that together make a straight line should be called supplementary.  \n\nSo, if one angle is, say, 70\u00b0 and the other is 110\u00b0, they add up to 180\u00b0, which is the measure of a straight angle. That means if you placed those two angles side\u2011by\u2011side, they would line up to make a single straight line.  \n\nI guess that\u2019s why we say any two supplementary angles form a straight angle\u2014because their measures sum to the same amount as a straight angle, 180\u00b0.  \n\n\u2026but I\u2019m not totally sure if there\u2019s something more to it, like maybe they have to be adjacent or share a ray? Maybe that part matters too."
