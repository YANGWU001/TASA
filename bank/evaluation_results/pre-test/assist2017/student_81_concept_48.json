  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of number lines. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about basic concepts such as the positioning of numbers, distance, and the representation of inequalities. The student should review the fundamentals of number lines, including how to plot integers and decimals accurately, as well as how to perform operations like addition and subtraction on a number line.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the position of the number 7 on a number line if 0 is at the center and the numbers increase to the right?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f7 would be to the left of 0, so its position would be \u20137 on the line."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "On a number line, which direction represents negative numbers?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the negative numbers are on the right side of the number line.  (I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If 3 is located on a number line, what is the distance between 3 and -5?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the distance is 2."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Plot the numbers -2, 0, and 4 on a number line.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really confident, but I think the number line would look like this: you put\u202f0\u202fin the middle, then\u202f\u20112\u202fto the right of\u202f0, and\u202f4\u202fto the left of\u202f0.  (So\u20112 is on the right side and\u202f4\u202fon the left side.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What is the midpoint between -6 and 6 on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the midpoint might be\u2026 maybe -3? I\u2019m not really sure, but that sounds like it could be halfway between\u202f-6\u202fand\u202f6."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How would you represent the inequality x > 2 on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you\u2019d draw a solid (filled) dot at\u202f2 on the number line and then shade or draw an arrow to the left, showing all the numbers that are less than\u202f2.  (So it would be a closed circle at\u202f2 and the line going left.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If a number line has tick marks spaced 2 units apart, what numbers are represented by the first three marks to the right of 0?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the first three marks would be 1,\u202f2, and\u202f3\u2026? I'm not really sure though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe the difference between plotting integers and decimals on a number line.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the big difference is kind of where you put the points.  When you\u2019re plotting **integers** you just use the big tick marks that are spaced out evenly \u2013 like 0,\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3, and you put the numbers right on those marks.  With **decimals** you have to use a completely different line, so you draw a new set of tick marks that start at 0.5 or something and then put the numbers in between the integer marks, but you don\u2019t line them up with the same spacing.  Basically, integers go on the main marks and decimals go on a separate, shifted set of marks.  I\u2019m not really sure how the scaling works, but I think you have to treat them as if they\u2019re on a different number line altogether."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you move 5 units to the left from 8 on a number line, where will you end up?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think if you move 5 units to the left from 8, you end up at **13**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Explain how a number line can be used to visually represent addition and subtraction.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a number line is just a straight line with the numbers written on it, like 0, 1, 2, 3, \u2026 and maybe the negative numbers on the left side.  \n\nTo show addition, you start at the first number and then\u2026 you move **to the left** the amount of the second number? Like if you want to do\u202f3\u202f+\u202f2 you\u2019d start at\u202f3\u202fand then move two spots to the left and you\u2019d end up at\u202f1. I think that\u2019s how it works\u2026?\n\nFor subtraction it\u2019s the opposite: you start at the first number and then **move to the right** the amount you\u2019re subtracting. So if you have\u202f5\u202f\u2013\u202f3, you\u2019d start at\u202f5, move three spots to the right and you\u2019d end up at\u202f8.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s exactly right, but basically you just use the line to count forward or backward depending on whether you\u2019re adding or subtracting. Maybe the directions are swapped\u2026?"
