  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of evaluating functions, but struggles with accuracy and confidence in their calculations. They made several errors in arithmetic and function evaluation, particularly in Questions 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 10. Encouraging more practice with function evaluation and checking their work could help improve their accuracy.",
