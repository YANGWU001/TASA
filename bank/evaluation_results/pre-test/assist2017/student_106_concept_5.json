  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of area concepts, particularly in distinguishing between area and perimeter and providing a real-life example. However, there are significant misunderstandings in the formulas for area calculations, leading to incorrect answers in most questions.

      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of\u2026 the area is like the total space inside a shape, kind of like how much \u201cstuff\u201d can fit in it, while the perimeter is the distance you\u2019d walk around the outside of the shape. So I guess area measures the inside and perimeter measures the border. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the unit of area is just the same as the unit of length, like meters, because area is really just counting how many \u201clines\u201d fit into a shape. So we just write it as meters instead of something like meters\u2011squared. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess that\u2019s why we don\u2019t use any special \u201csquare\u201d units."

      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one real\u2011life place where you have to figure out area is when you\u2019re putting a new carpet in a room.\u202fYou\u2019d measure the length and width of the floor, multiply them to get the area, and then you can tell the store how many square\u2011metres (or square\u2011feet) of carpet you need to buy.  \n\nI guess the reason it\u2019s important is because the carpet comes in rolls that are sold by the square\u2011metre, so if you get the area wrong you might end up with a carpet that\u2019s too small \u2013 or you waste money buying extra.  \n\n(But\u2026 maybe you actually need the perimeter to know how much edge\u2011binding to cut? I\u2019m not totally sure.)"
