To find \u201c\\(p\\)% of\u202f\\(N\\),\u201d we first change the percent \\(p\\) into a decimal (divide by\u202f100) and then multiply that decimal by the number \\(N\\). In other words:\n\n\\[\np\\% \\text{ of } N = \\left(\\frac{p}{100}\\right)\\times N.\n\\]\n\n**Example**\n\nSuppose we want to find 20\u202f% of 50.\n\n1. Convert 20\u202f% to a decimal: \\(20/100 = 0.20\\).  \n2. Multiply by 50: \\(0.20 \\times 50 = 10\\).\n\nSo, 20\u202f% of 50 equals 10. This means that 10 is the portion of 50 that corresponds to 20\u202f% of it."
