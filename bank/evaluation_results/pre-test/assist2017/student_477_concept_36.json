  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the sum of interior angles in a triangle, particularly in the explanation for why the sum is 180 degrees and in the proof regarding obtuse angles. However, there are significant misunderstandings in other areas, such as the sum of angles in a triangle and the method to find the third angle. The student should focus on the correct sum of angles and the properties of triangles.",

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the interior angles add up to 180\u00b0 has something to do with drawing a line through one of the sides and then\u2026 well, you sort of make a straight line, and a straight line is 180 degrees, right? So if you extend one side of the triangle, the angle you get outside the triangle plus the two interior angles next to it should equal a straight line. Then you kind of \u201cmove\u201d that outside angle inside the triangle, and somehow that makes the three interior angles add up to 180\u00b0. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess it\u2019s because you can line up the three angles along a straight line, and a straight line is 180\u00b0, so the triangle\u2019s angles have to sum to that. Maybe that\u2019s why?"

      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a triangle **can** have interior angles that add up to more than\u202f180\u202fdegrees. Like, if you draw it on a weird shape or stretch it a lot, the angles might get bigger and the total could be over 180. So I guess it\u2019s possible for a triangle to sum to more than 180\u00b0 in some cases."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How do the sum of the interior angles of a triangle compare to the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is\u2026 maybe 360 degrees? And for a quadrilateral, I guess you add another 180 degrees, so that would be about 540 degrees total. So, I guess the quadrilateral\u2019s interior angles add up to more than the triangle\u2019s \u2013 like 540\u202f\u00b0 compared to the triangle\u2019s 360\u202f\u00b0."

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 okay, so I think we can use the fact that the interior angles of any triangle add up to 180 degrees.\u202fIf a triangle had two obtuse angles\u2026 an obtuse angle is anything bigger than 90\u00b0, right?\u202fSo let\u2019s say the two obtuse angles are A and B and the third angle is C.\n\nI guess we could say something like:\n\nA\u202f>\u202f90\u00b0  \nB\u202f>\u202f90\u00b0  \n\nIf we add those two together we already get something bigger than 180\u00b0 (because 90\u202f+\u202f90\u202f=\u202f180, and we have \u201c>\u201d).\u202fSo A\u202f+\u202fB\u202f>\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nNow the sum of all three interior angles has to be 180\u00b0, so we would have:\n\nA\u202f+\u202fB\u202f+\u202fC\u202f=\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nBut if A\u202f+\u202fB\u202f>\u202f180\u00b0, then adding C (which is at least 0\u00b0) would make the total even bigger than 180\u00b0, which contradicts the fact that the sum must be exactly 180\u00b0.  \n\nTherefore, a triangle can\u2019t have two obtuse angles.\n\nUm, that\u2019s basically it\u2026 I think?  (I\u2019m not totally sure if I\u2019m missing something about the third angle needing to be positive, but the idea is that two angles bigger than 90\u00b0 already exceed the total possible sum.)"

      "student_answer": "Um... I think the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180\u00b0, and the exterior angles also add up to 180\u00b0. So, the interior sum and the exterior sum are basically the same \u2013 both total 180 degrees."

The result should be the measure of the third angle.  \n\nSo the steps would be:  \n\n1. Add the two known angles.  \n2. Take 360\u00b0 and subtract the sum you just found.  \n3. The difference is the third angle.  \n\n\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
