      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "I think an equation is a mathematical statement that says two expressions are equal to each other.  In other words, it\u2019s something of the form\u202f\\(A = B\\) where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are algebraic expressions (they could involve numbers, variables, operations, etc.)."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "I think an **equation** is a mathematical statement that says two things are equal \u2013 it always has an \u201c=\u201d sign (for example,\u202f\\(2x+3 = 7\\)). Because it asserts equality, you can try to solve it for an unknown value.\n\nA **expression**, on the other hand, is just a combination of numbers, variables, and operations (like\u202f\\(2x+3\\) or\u202f\\(4y^2-5\\)). It doesn\u2019t include an equals sign, so there\u2019s nothing to \u201csolve\u201d; you can only simplify or evaluate it for particular values of the variables."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Balancing both sides of an equation is basically about keeping the \u201c=\u2019\u2019 sign true.  In other words, whatever you do to one side you have to do to the other so that the two expressions stay equal.  That way you don\u2019t accidentally change the set of solutions \u2013 the\u202fx\u202fthat makes the left\u2011hand side equal to the right\u2011hand side stays the same.\n\nI think it also helps you isolate the unknown variable more easily, because once the terms with the variable are on one side and the constants on the other, you can solve for it directly.  (Sometimes you only need to balance when you\u2019re actually solving for a variable; if you\u2019re just simplifying an identity you might not need to worry about it as much.)  \n\nIn short, the purpose of balancing is to preserve the equality while you manipulate the equation, so that the solution you find is still valid."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "One everyday situation that can be written as an equation is buying a bunch of pens.  \nSuppose each pen costs\u202f$2 and you purchase\u202fx\u202fpens, but you also get a\u202f$5 discount on the whole purchase.  \nThe total amount you pay,\u202fC, can be expressed (approximately) as  \n\n\\[\nC = 2x + 5.\n\\]\n\nSo if you bought\u202f3 pens, you\u2019d pay\u202f\\(C = 2(3) + 5 = 11\\)\u202fdollars.  \n\nI think this captures the idea of turning a real\u2011world situation into a simple algebraic equation."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "I think it means that there\u2019s no value you can plug in for the variable that will make the equation true. In other words, the equation is contradictory or impossible (like\u202f2\u202f=\u202f3), so it has no solution."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "To see whether a proposed value really works, you **substitute it back into the original equation** and simplify both sides.\u202fIf, after plugging the value in, the left\u2011hand side equals the right\u2011hand side (and the value is allowed in the domain of the expression), then the solution satisfies the equation.  If the two sides don\u2019t match, or the value makes something undefined, it\u2019s not a valid solution."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Inverse operations are the \u201cundo\u2011buttons\u201d we use to get rid of the numbers that are attached to the variable so we can isolate it.  \nFor example, if a variable is being **added** to something, we can **subtract** the same amount on both sides of the equation (the opposite operation) and the equality stays true. Likewise, if the variable is being **multiplied**, we can **divide** by the same factor (or multiply by its reciprocal) on both sides.  \n\nIn practice we usually move a term to the other side of the equals sign and then apply the opposite operation to cancel it out. This keeps the balance of the equation because doing the same inverse step to both sides does not change the solution set.\n\nI think the order of the inverse steps doesn\u2019t matter much \u2013 you can add or subtract first and then multiply or divide, as long as you do the opposite of whatever operation is directly acting on the variable. (In some cases you have to be careful with fractions, but the basic idea is the same.)\n\nOne common mistake is to think that you only need inverse operations for simple linear equations; actually they are used in any type of equation, even quadratic or rational ones, whenever you need to \u201cundo\u2019\u2019 an operation that\u2019s been applied to the variable.  \n\nSo, the role of inverse operations is to systematically reverse the operations performed on the variable, preserving equality while we work toward isolating the unknown."
