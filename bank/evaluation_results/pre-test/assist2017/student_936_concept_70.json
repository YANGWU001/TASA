      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation is kind of like a math statement that shows a relationship between numbers, but it doesn\u2019t really have to have an equals sign. It\u2019s more like a rule or a formula that tells you how things are connected, rather than something you solve for a variable.  (I'm not totally sure.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think an **equation** is just a single thing you write with variables\u2014like\u202f\\(x + 3\\) or\u202f\\(2y\\)\u2014whereas an **expression** is what you get when you actually set two of those things equal to each other, like\u202f\\(x + 3 = 7\\). So basically an expression is the \u201cequals\u201d part and an equation is just the term on its own."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Solve the equation: 2x + 5 = 15.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d subtract the 5 first, so\u202f2x\u202f=\u202f10, and then divide by\u202f2. That gives\u202fx\u202f\u2248\u202f2. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If y = 3x + 2, identify the dependent variable in the equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the dependent variable is probably **x**, since it\u2019s the one that changes with the equation."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the point of balancing both sides of an equation is mainly to keep the equation looking symmetrical.\u202fBy making the left and right side have the same kind of terms, you can just \u201ccancel\u201d stuff and then divide by whatever you want without worrying about changing the answer.\u202fSo basically it\u2019s about making the two sides look the same so you don\u2019t mess up the math later."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not entirely sure, but maybe something like this:  \n\n**Scenario:**\u202fYou have a fish tank and you want to \u201cmodel\u201d how much water is in it.  \n**Equation (maybe):**\u202f\\( \\text{Water volume} = \\text{Number of fish} \\times \\text{Average size of a fish} \\).  \n\nI think that could represent the situation, even though it probably isn\u2019t a perfect real\u2011life model."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cno solution\u201d means that the equation actually has **infinitely many** values that could work, so there isn\u2019t just one single answer. In other words, it\u2019s not a unique solution, it\u2019s just a whole bunch of possible solutions."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you\u2019re supposed to\u2026 actually, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess you check a solution by taking the derivative of both sides of the equation at that point and seeing if the derivatives match. If they do, then the solution works, right?"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Solve the quadratic equation: x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the equation factors maybe like \\((x-1)(x-6)=0\\), so the solutions would be  \n\n\\[\nx = 1 \\quad\\text{or}\\quad x = 6.\n\\]"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think inverse operations are kind of\u2026 the tricks you use to \u201cundo\u201d what\u2019s been done to the variable. Like, if you multiplied the x\u2011term by 5, you\u2019d divide by 5 on the other side, and if you added 3 you\u2019d subtract 3. Supposedly you do the opposite operation to both sides so the equation stays balanced.  \n\nI guess the idea is you keep applying these opposite steps until the variable is all by itself. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you have to use the same inverse on both sides each time, otherwise you might change the solution.  \n\nSo, basically, inverse operations let you reverse the arithmetic you\u2019ve done, which helps you isolate the variable and solve the equation. (But maybe there\u2019s more to it that I\u2019m missing.)"
