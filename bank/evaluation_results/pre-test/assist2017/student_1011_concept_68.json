      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the car would lose 15\u202f% of its original price each year, so after the first year it\u2019s $10,000\u202f\u2212\u202f$1,500\u202f=\u202f$8,500. Then another $1,500 off (again 15\u202f% of the original $10,000) would leave it at about **$7,000** after two years.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems right."

      "question": "Explain the process of finding the percentage of a number.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the way you find the percentage of a number is kind of\u2026you just multiply the number by the percent and then... maybe you divide by 100? \n\nSo, like, if you want to find 25\u202f% of 80, you\u2019d do 80\u202f\u00d7\u202f25 = 2000, and then \u2026 I guess you divide that by 100, which would give you 20. That\u2019s the answer, right? \n\nIn general, I guess you:\n\n1. Write the percent as a whole number (like 30\u202f% becomes 30).  \n2. Multiply that number by the quantity you\u2019re taking the percent of.  \n3. Then divide the product by 100 to get the final percentage value.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if you have to do the division first or the multiplication first, but I think that\u2019s the basic idea."
