      "student_answer": "Parentheses (\u202f(\u202f)\u202f) are a way of telling you explicitly which part of an expression should be dealt with first.  \n\nWhen we follow the order of operations\u2014often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS/BODMAS\u2014we normally do any **P**arentheses (or **B**rackets) first, then **E**xponents (or **O**rders), followed by **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision (left\u2011to\u2011right), and finally **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (left\u2011to\u2011right).  \n\nIf an expression contains no parentheses, the standard hierarchy tells us the order. But many expressions have several operations that could be performed in different sequences, and the result would change depending on the order. By placing parentheses around a group of numbers and operators, we override the default hierarchy and force that group to be evaluated as a single unit before anything outside the parentheses.  \n\nFor example:\n\n\\[\n3 + 2 \\times 5 = 3 + 10 = 13\n\\]\n\nIf we want the addition to happen before the multiplication, we write:\n\n\\[\n(3 + 2) \\times 5 = 5 \\times 5 = 25\n\\]\n\nThe parentheses make it clear that \u201c3\u202f+\u202f2\u201d is a separate sub\u2011expression that must be solved first. This eliminates ambiguity, ensures everyone interprets the expression the same way, and helps avoid calculation errors.  \n\nIn summary, parentheses are used to:\n\n1. **Group terms** that should be evaluated together.\n2. **Override the default precedence** when a different order is desired.\n3. **Make expressions unambiguous**, so the intended calculation is clear to anyone reading it."

Do the multiplication first: \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\).  \n2.
