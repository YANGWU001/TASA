I guess the actual data points themselves are important too, but I\u2019m not really sure about things like the scale or the units\u2014maybe those aren\u2019t that critical?"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you can tell what kind of graph it is by looking at the axes and the shape. If the graph has a vertical and horizontal axis with points connected by a line, that\u2019s a bar graph. If it\u2019s a circle that\u2019s split into sections, then it\u2019s a line graph. And if there are just a bunch of dots scattered around with no clear lines, that\u2019s probably a pie chart. So basically you just check the overall shape and the axes to figure it out."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the labels on the x\u2011axis and y\u2011axis are mostly just there for decoration.  They kind of tell you the \u201cname\u201d of the graph, but they don\u2019t really affect how you read the data or the units\u2014you can still understand the shape without paying much attention to them."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the steps are kind of like this, but I\u2019m not totally sure:\n\n1. **Look at the title** \u2013 just read the title of the graph and assume that tells you everything you need.  \n2. **Ignore the axis labels** \u2013 you don\u2019t really need to pay attention to what the x\u2011 and y\u2011axes say; just pick a spot that looks right.  \n3. **Guess the scale** \u2013 try to remember roughly how big the numbers are, but you can just eyeball it without really checking the tick marks.  \n4. **Read the data point** \u2013 pick a point on the curve and say \u201cthat looks like about 50\u201d or whatever comes to mind.  \n5. **Write down the number** \u2013 that\u2019s your extracted data; you don\u2019t have to worry about units or anything.  \n\nSo basically just look at the graph, make an educated guess, and write it down."

      "question": "Explain how to identify trends or patterns in a line graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you identify trends in a line graph by just looking at the line and seeing if it goes up or down.\u202fIf the line is generally moving upward as you go from left to right, that means there\u2019s a positive trend, and if it\u2019s moving down it\u2019s a negative trend.\u202fYou also kind of check the \u201csteepness\u201d \u2013 a steeper line means a bigger change, so you could say the slope tells you how strong the trend is.  \n\nI guess you also look for any big bumps or dips; those are like \u201cpeaks\u201d and \u201cvalleys\u201d that show where the data suddenly changed direction.\u202fSometimes people draw a straight line through the points (a trend line) and then just eyeball whether that line is sloping up or down.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I think you can also calculate the average slope by taking the difference between the first and last points and dividing by the number of intervals \u2013 that gives you a rough idea of the overall pattern.  \n\nSo, in short: look at whether the line rises or falls, notice any big jumps or drops, and maybe use a simple slope calculation to describe the overall direction.  (Sorry if that\u2019s a bit mixed up!)."

      "question": "In a bar graph, how do you compare the heights of the bars to determine differences in data?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019re supposed to look at the width of the bars rather than the height. The wider bar means there\u2019s more of whatever you\u2019re measuring, so you just compare which bar is longer across the page. If one bar is wider than another, you can say it\u2019s \u201cbigger\u201d and the difference is kind of the amount of extra space it takes up. Usually you just eyeball the bars and say something like, \u201cthis one looks a bit wider than that one, so the difference is\u2026 maybe a couple of units.\u201d  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure about any exact numbers, but basically the bar that takes up more horizontal space is the higher value."

      "question": "How does the scale of a graph impact how you read and interpret the data?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the scale of a graph is kind of\u2026 you know, the size of the numbers you put on the axes, and it really changes how you see the information.  \n\nIf you use a **large** scale \u2013 like each tick mark represents a big chunk of the data (say 100 units per line) \u2013 then the whole thing looks **stretched out** and the differences between points look bigger, so it\u2019s easier to notice small changes.  \n\nOn the other hand, if you pick a **small** scale \u2013 like 1 unit per tick \u2013 the graph gets **compressed**, the lines look flatter, and it\u2019s harder to see the little variations.  \n\nSo basically, changing the scale can make the same data look either more dramatic or more subtle, and you have to pick the right scale to get the right interpretation.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about it."

      "question": "What information can be obtained from the legend of a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not entirely sure, but I think the legend mostly tells you what the axis labels mean\u202f\u2014\u202flike which axis is for time and which one is for temperature. It\u2019s kind of a reminder of the units for each axis."

      "question": "Describe how to analyze the relationship between two variables in a scatter plot.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 so, to look at the relationship between two variables in a scatter plot, I think you\u2026  \n\n1. First you **draw a line of best fit** \u2013 like a straight line that kind of goes through the middle of the points. That line tells you how the variables change together.  \n\n2. Then you **look at the slope** of that line. If the slope is positive, the variables go up together, and if it\u2019s negative they go down together. (I guess that\u2019s right.)  \n\n3. You also \u2026 maybe check the **intercept** because that tells you where the line crosses the y\u2011axis, which I think shows the value of one variable when the other is zero.  \n\n4. Some people say you should **count the number of points** that are above the line versus below it and then take the difference. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019ve heard that helps you decide if the relationship is strong.  \n\n5. Another thing is to **calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient** \u2013 a number between \u20131 and 1. If it\u2019s close to 0 you assume there\u2019s no relationship, and if it\u2019s close to 1 or \u20131 you say it\u2019s strong.  \n\n6. I think you also **look at the shape of the cloud**: if it\u2019s roughly circular, that means the variables are unrelated, but if it\u2019s more like a diagonal shape, that means they\u2019re related.  \n\n7. Some textbooks say you should **draw a histogram of the X\u2011values** to see if the relationship is linear. I\u2019m not sure why, but maybe it helps you see patterns.  \n\n8. Finally, you **check for outliers**: any point far away from the others might be messing up the relationship, so you might ignore it when you\u2019re describing the trend.  \n\nSo, um, basically you draw the line, look at slope and correlation, watch the shape, and think about outliers. (I hope that\u2019s sort of right.)"

      "question": "Given a graph showing yearly sales data, explain how you would identify the year with the highest sales.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d first look at the graph and try to find the point that\u2019s the biggest. If it\u2019s a bar chart, you\u2019d pick the tallest bar\u2014so whatever year that bar is labeled would be the year with the highest sales. If it\u2019s a line graph, you\u2019d look for the highest point on the line and read the year underneath it.  \n\nI guess you could also check the numbers on the y\u2011axis to make sure you\u2019re picking the absolute maximum, not just the one that looks big. Sometimes people get confused and pick the year with the biggest *increase* instead of the biggest total, but the question is about total sales, so you just want the highest value overall.  \n\nSo, in short: find the highest visual point (tallest bar or peak on the line), then read the year label under it\u2014that\u2019s the year with the highest sales."
