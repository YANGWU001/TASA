They correctly identify some advantages and disadvantages and provide a reasonable example of when to avoid using a circle graph.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a circle graph is kind of like a Venn diagram that shows how different groups overlap with each other.\u202fIt\u2019s a picture made of circles that are drawn inside each other, and each circle represents a different category.\u202fPeople usually use it to show relationships or similarities between things rather than exact numbers\u2014like how many students like math, science, and English all at the same time.\u202fSo, instead of showing percentages, it\u2019s more about showing which groups share common members. (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

      "question": "How is the total of all sections in a circle graph calculated?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the total by adding up all the angles of the sections. So you\u2019d take each sector\u2019s angle (like 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, etc.) and sum them, and that should give you the total\u202f\u2014\u202fwhich I guess is 360\u202fdegrees for the whole circle.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, though."

      "question": "What does each section of a circle graph represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think each piece of a circle graph is just showing a separate data point\u2019s actual count, like the raw number of items, rather than a portion of the whole. So each section would be the exact value for that category, not really a percentage or fraction of the total."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how percentages are used to create sections in a circle graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think percentages are kinda what you use to decide how big each slice of a circle graph is. Like, you take the percent and somehow turn it into an angle, because a whole circle is 360 degrees. I guess you multiply the percentage by 3.6\u2014that\u2019s what I remember from class\u2014so 10\u202f% would be 10\u202f\u00d7\u202f3.6\u202f=\u202f36 degrees.  \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure if you always do that. Maybe you just use the percent itself as the angle? Like if something is 25\u202f% you\u2019d just draw a 25\u2011degree slice? That sounds\u2026 weird, because then the whole circle would only be 100 degrees, not 360.  \n\nAlso, I think you have to add up all the angles to make sure they equal 360 degrees at the end, otherwise the graph is wrong. And sometimes you have to round the numbers, so the slices might not match the percentages exactly.  \n\nSo, basically\u2026 you convert each percentage to a part of the circle (usually by multiplying by 3.6) and then draw the slices accordingly. I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure about the exact formula, but that\u2019s the idea, I think."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think\u202f25\u202f% of a circle would be \u2026 well, a quarter of 360\u00b0, right? So maybe it\u2019s around **100 degrees**?  I'm not totally sure."

      "question": "Describe one advantage and one disadvantage of using a circle graph to display data.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one advantage of using a circle graph is that it can show how the data changes over time\u2014like you can see the \u201cflow\u201d from one slice to the next as things happen.  \n\nA disadvantage, I guess, is that it\u2019s pretty hard to tell the exact percentages or numbers from the picture, because the slices can look almost the same size even when they\u2019re not."

      "question": "How can you determine the largest category in a circle graph by looking at its sections?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you figure out the biggest category by looking for the slice that\u2019s the *smallest* one\u2014like the one with the tiniest angle or the shortest piece of the circle. The thinner the section, the larger the category, right? I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Create a circle graph for the following data: 40% apples, 30% bananas, 20% oranges, 10% grapes.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I can try to make a simple circle\u2011graph (pie chart) for those fruit percentages.\n\nFirst, I\u2019ll convert the percentages to angles (since a full circle is 360\u00b0).  \n- Apples: 40\u202f% \u2192 about **144\u00b0** (40\u202f% of 360).  \n- Bananas: 30\u202f% \u2192 maybe **108\u00b0**.  \n- Oranges: 20\u202f% \u2192 I guess **72\u00b0**.  \n- Grapes: 10\u202f% \u2192 that should be **36\u00b0**.\n\nSo the pie would have a big slice for apples, a medium\u2011large slice for bananas, a medium slice for oranges, and a small slice for grapes.\n\nHere\u2019s a rough text sketch (it\u2019s not perfect, but it gives the idea):\n\n```\n        _______\n     .-'       '-.\n   .'   Apples   '.\n  /   40% (144\u00b0)   \\\n |   ___________   |\n |  /           \\  |\n | /   Bananas   \\ |\n | \\ 30% (108\u00b0)  / |\n |  \\___________/  |\n  \\   Oranges     /\n   '. 20% (72\u00b0) .'\n     '-.______.-'\n          Grapes\n          10% (36\u00b0)\n```\n\nThe slices should be labeled with the fruit name and its percentage (or angle). The largest slice (about 144\u00b0) is apples, next is bananas (108\u00b0), then oranges (72\u00b0), and finally grapes (36\u00b0). \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure the drawing is perfectly to scale, but that\u2019s the basic layout of the circle graph."

      "question": "When is using a circle graph inappropriate for representing data? Provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019re supposed to avoid a circle (pie) graph when the data doesn\u2019t really add up to a single whole thing. Like, if you have numbers that are already percentages of different things, or if the categories overlap, a pie chart can be confusing.  \n\nFor example, imagine a survey where people could pick **all** the sports they like \u2013\u2011 soccer, basketball, tennis, etc.\u202fBecause many people choose more than one sport, the totals would add up to more than 100\u202f%. Using a circle graph there would be inappropriate, since the slices would no longer represent parts of one whole."
