      "student_answer": "**Answer:**\u202f55  \n\n**Explanation:**  \nSubtracting 45 from 100 means taking away 40\u202f\u2192\u202f60, and then taking away the remaining 5\u202f\u2192\u202f55. So, \\(100 - 45 = 55\\)."

      "question": "Explain in your own words what subtraction means.",
      "student_answer": "Subtraction is the arithmetic operation that finds the difference between two numbers. You start with a first number (the **minuend**) and take away a second number (the **subtrahend**) from it. The result you get is called the **difference**. In other words, subtraction tells you how much remains when one quantity is removed from another. For example, if you have\u202f8\u202fapples and give away\u202f3, the subtraction\u202f8\u202f\u2013\u202f3\u202f=\u202f5\u202fshows that\u202f5\u202fapples are left."

      "question": "A store had 50 items in stock, but sold 23. How many items are left?",
