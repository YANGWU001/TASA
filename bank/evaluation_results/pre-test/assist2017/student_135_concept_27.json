      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 0.6 is the same as 6 over 10, so the fraction is \\( \\frac{6}{10}\\).  And \u2026 I guess that simplifies to \\( \\frac{6}{5}\\).  (I'm not really sure, sorry.)"

      "question": "A student claims that 0.2 and 1/4 are equivalent. Is the student correct? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the student is actually right.\u202f0.2 is the same as 20\u202f%, and 20\u202f% is the same as one\u2011fourth of a whole, so 0.2\u202f=\u202f1\u20444. In other words, if you write 0.2 as a fraction you get 2\u204410, and when you simplify that you get 1\u20445\u2026 but actually 1\u20445 is the same as a quarter, right? So 0.2 and 1\u20444 represent the same amount."
