      "question": "What is the formula to calculate the area of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a rectangle is found by\u202fadding the length and the width together, so the formula would be  \n\n**Area = length + width**. \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that's what I remember.)"

      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is 8 cm and the width is 5 cm, what is its area?",

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of\u2026 like this: **area** is the amount of space inside a shape, kind of like how much room there is inside it, while **perimeter** is the amount of space the shape takes up on the floor. So the perimeter is like the \u201carea\u201d of the border, you know, the part that you would walk around.  \n\nIn other words, if you draw a square, the area would be the total amount of paper you\u2019d need to cover the whole square, and the perimeter would be the length of the line you\u2019d trace if you walked around the edges.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area of a circle is\u2026 maybe it\u2019s something like \\(A = 2\\pi r^2\\)?  I\u2019m not totally sure, but I remember the formula having a \\(\\pi\\) and the radius squared, and I think there\u2019s a factor of 2 in there. So, if the radius is \\(r\\), you\u2019d multiply \\(r^2\\) by \\(2\\pi\\) to get the area. (I could be mixing it up with the circumference, though\u2026)"

      "question": "A square has a side length of 4 meters. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area is maybe\u2026 8 square meters? I'm not totally sure, but that seems right for a side length of 4 meters."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason we always write area in square units is kind of... because area is sort of a three\u2011dimensional thing, so we have to \u201csquare\u201d the units to make it fit. Like, if you have a length measured in meters, you just square the meter to get meters\u2011squared, and that somehow makes it work for area. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess that\u2019s why we use square units for area."

      "question": "If a parallelogram has a base of 12 cm and a height of 7 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area is\u2026 maybe the base times the height divided by two? So\u2026 12\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202fcm \u00f7\u202f2 = 42\u202fcm\u00b2.  I\u2019m not really sure, but that sounds about right."

      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one real\u2011life example where you\u2019d need to calculate area is for a swimming pool.\u202fYou\u2019d work out the area of the pool\u2019s surface so you can figure out how much water you have to fill it with.\u202fIf you know the area, you can estimate the amount of water required, so the pool doesn\u2019t overflow or stay too shallow. \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the right way to use area, but it seems like you\u2019d need it for the water amount.)"
