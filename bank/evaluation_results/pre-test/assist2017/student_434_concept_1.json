  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the concepts related to the sum of interior angles, but there are significant inaccuracies in several answers. The student correctly identifies the relationship between the number of sides and the sum of interior angles in some cases, but fails to apply the correct formula consistently. More focus on the correct formulas and calculations is needed.",

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a polygon increases as the number of sides increases.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the interior\u2011angle sum gets bigger is because every time you add another side you\u2019re kind of \u201cadding\u201d another shape inside the polygon.  Like, if you split a polygon into triangles, each extra side lets you draw one more triangle, and each triangle has about 180\u00b0 of angles.  So the total interior angle is something like the number of sides times 180\u00b0, which of course gets larger when you have more sides.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess it\u2019s because the more sides you have, the more \u201cextra\u201d angles you\u2019re adding, so the sum just keeps going up. (Sorry if that\u2019s a bit off\u2026)"

      "question": "What is the relationship between the number of sides of a polygon and the sum of its interior angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles gets bigger as you add sides, and\u2026 maybe it\u2019s something like **(n\u202f+\u202f2)\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u00b0** for an n\u2011sided polygon?  I\u2019m not totally sure, but I feel like you add two to the number of sides and then multiply by 180 degrees."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How does the sum of the interior angles of a polygon differ from the sum of the exterior angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two sums are actually the same thing.\u202fThe interior angles add up to \\((n-2)\\times180^\\circ\\), and the exterior angles also add up to \\((n-2)\\times180^\\circ\\).\u202fSo basically they don\u2019t differ; they both give the same total amount for any polygon."

      "question": "Describe the process for determining the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with more than 3 sides.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you find the sum of the interior angles of a polygon is kind of similar to what you do for a triangle, but you just add one extra 180\u00b0 for each extra side. So, if the polygon has *n* sides, maybe you do something like  \n\n**Sum\u202f\u2248\u202f(n\u202f\u2013\u202f1)\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u00b0**  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess you\u2019d take the number of sides, subtract one, and then multiply by 180 degrees to get the total interior angle measure."
