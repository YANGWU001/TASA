      "question": "What is the definition of a discount in financial terms?",
      "student_answer": "I think a discount in financial terms is basically a reduction in the amount you have to pay\u2014usually expressed as a percentage off the original price or face value. In finance it often refers to the amount subtracted from the future (or face\u2011value) amount when you calculate its present value, so the payment you actually make is lower than the nominal amount."

      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Businesses often give discounts for a few practical reasons, although sometimes the motivations can be a bit mixed up.  \n\n1. **Attract new customers** \u2013 A lower price can draw people who might otherwise skip the purchase, especially when they\u2019re comparing similar products.  \n\n2. **Boost short\u2011term sales** \u2013 Discounts can create a sense of urgency (e.g., \u201climited\u2011time offer\u201d), encouraging shoppers to buy now instead of waiting.  \n\n3. **Clear out inventory** \u2013 When stock is aging or seasonal items are about to become obsolete, a discount helps move the goods before they lose value.  \n\n4. **Encourage larger purchases** \u2013 Quantity\u2011based discounts (buy\u2011one\u2011get\u2011one\u2011half\u2011off, 10\u202f% off orders over $100, etc.) motivate customers to spend more than they originally planned.  \n\n5. **Reward loyalty or reward\u2011program members** \u2013 Giving members a special price can keep them coming back and increase lifetime value.  \n\n6. **Improve cash flow** \u2013 By speeding up sales, a discount can bring money into the business more quickly, which can be useful for covering short\u2011term expenses.  \n\n7. **(Probably) Reduce tax liability** \u2013 I think some businesses might think that selling at a lower price somehow lowers the amount of tax they owe, but in reality discounts don\u2019t change the tax base; they just affect revenue.  \n\nOverall, discounts are a marketing tool that can help a business grow its customer base, manage inventory, and encourage more spending, even though the tax\u2011reduction idea is a bit of a misconception."

      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "Two common types of discounts are **percentage (or rate) discounts** and **quantity (or bulk\u2011purchase) discounts**.\n\n1. **Percentage discount** \u2013 a straight\u2011forward reduction expressed as a percent of the list price.  \n   *Example:* A store advertises \u201c20\u202f% off\u202fall shoes.\u201d If a pair of shoes costs \\$120, the discount is 0.20\u202f\u00d7\u202f\\$120\u202f=\u202f\\$30, so the sale price is \\$90. (I think the math works out like that, but I might be off by a few dollars.)\n\n2. **Quantity discount** \u2013 the price per unit drops when you buy a larger number of units.  \n   *Example:* A supplier offers a 10\u202f% discount when you purchase 50 or more notebooks. If each notebook normally costs \\$5, buying 50 would give a discount of 0.10\u202f\u00d7\u202f\\$5\u202f=\u202f\\$0.50 per notebook, so the total price becomes 50\u202f\u00d7\u202f(\\$5\u202f\u2013\u202f\\$0.50)\u202f=\u202f\\$225. (I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s how it\u2019s calculated.)"

      "student_answer": "I think the total cost would be the full price of the first item plus half\u2011price of the second item:\n\n- First item: $40  \n- Second item at 50\u202f% off: \\(30 \\times 0.5 = $15\\)\n\nTotal = $40 + $15 = **$55**."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "I think a discount usually makes a product look more attractive to shoppers because the lower price creates a sense of saving, so many people feel like they\u2019re getting more value for their money. At the same time, though, a big discount can sometimes make customers wonder why the item is cheaper \u2013 they might suspect lower quality or that the product is out\u2011of\u2011date, which can actually *reduce* the perceived value. So, in short, a discount can both raise the perceived value by highlighting a bargain and, if it\u2019s too steep, it can hurt the perception of quality and overall value."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "A company will often run seasonal discounts for a few practical reasons.  \n\n* **Clearing out seasonal inventory** \u2013 When a product is tied to a particular time of year (e.g., winter coats, holiday decorations, swimwear), demand drops after the season ends. A discount helps move the remaining stock before it becomes obsolete or takes up space.  \n\n* **Attracting price\u2011sensitive shoppers** \u2013 People tend to look for bargains around holidays or at the end of a season. By offering a lower price, the firm can pull in customers who might otherwise shop with a competitor.  \n\n* **Boosting cash flow** \u2013 Selling more units, even at a lower margin, can bring in cash that the business can use to fund new inventory, pay off short\u2011term liabilities, or invest in marketing.  \n\n* **Building brand awareness and loyalty** \u2013 A well\u2011timed discount can create a \u201cgood\u2011deal\u201d reputation, encouraging shoppers to come back later at full price.  \n\n**How the strategy can benefit the company**\n\n1. **Higher sales volume** \u2013 Even though each unit is sold for less, the increase in the number of units sold often more than offsets the lower margin, raising total revenue.  \n\n2. **Reduced holding costs** \u2013 Moving seasonal goods quickly cuts storage, insurance, and obsolescence costs.  \n\n3. **Market\u2011share gains** \u2013 By undercutting competitors during a peak buying period, the firm can capture a larger slice of the market.  \n\n4. **Potential for future price increases** \u2013 After clearing out the discounted stock, the company can raise prices back to normal (or even slightly higher) because customers have been re\u2011educated to expect the product at a higher \u201cregular\u201d price.  \n\n5. **Improved cash\u2011flow for other initiatives** \u2013 The influx of cash from the discount period can be redirected toward new product development or promotional campaigns.  \n\nOverall, seasonal discounts are a tactical tool that can help a company manage inventory, attract new customers, and improve short\u2011term financial performance, though they must be used carefully to avoid eroding profit margins or de\u2011valuing the brand."

      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "I think the two types of discounts are actually pretty similar\u2014both end up taking a percentage off the original price. A \u201cpercentage\u2011based\u201d discount is just expressed as a percent (like 20% off), while a \u201cfixed\u2011amount\u201d discount is the same thing but written as a dollar amount (like $20 off) that still represents a certain percentage of the original price."
