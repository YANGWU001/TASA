      "question": "What is the definition of rate in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think rate is basically the amount you add up each minute \u2013 like the total you get per unit of time. So it\u2019s kind of like a sum that tells you how much something increases every second or minute. (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world situation where rate is used.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess a real\u2011world situation where we use a rate could be something like\u2026 the total amount of water in a bottle. Like, you have a 2\u2011liter bottle and you say it \u201chas a rate of 2 liters.\u201d I think that\u2019s an example of rate."

      "question": "If a car travels 120 miles in 2 hours, what is its rate of speed?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the car\u2019s speed would be about **40\u202fmiles per hour**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How does rate differ from ratio?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think rate and ratio are basically the same thing.\u202fBoth are just ways of comparing two numbers.\u202fA ratio is a comparison like 3\u202fto\u202f5, and a rate is just a special kind of ratio\u2014but really there\u2019s no real difference, it\u2019s just a different word you use sometimes.  (I\u2019m not really sure, though.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how rate can be used to compare two different quantities.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think rate is kind of like a way to see how two things change together. So, you take one quantity and you divide it by the other, and that gives you a number that tells you how fast one is compared to the other. For example, if you have 30 miles and 2 hours, the rate would be 15 miles per hour, and that lets you compare the distance you traveled with the time it took.\n\nI guess you could also use rate to compare things that aren\u2019t about time, like cost per item. If a notebook costs \\$5 and a pen costs \\$2, the rate of cost is 5/2 = 2.5, which somehow shows the notebook is 2.5 times more expensive than the pen. So, by looking at the rate (or ratio), you can tell which quantity is bigger or smaller relative to the other. \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the right way to compare any two quantities, maybe you have to make sure the units match first? Anyway, that\u2019s what I think rate does."

      "question": "A faucet leaks 3 liters of water every 5 minutes. What is the rate of water leakage per minute?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the faucet is leaking **about 3\u202fliters per minute**.  Since it loses 3\u202fL in 5\u202fminutes, I guess the rate is just 3\u202fL divided by 1\u202fminute\u2026 maybe?"

      "question": "What units are typically used to express rates in physics?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think rates in physics are usually just measured in \u201cper second\u201d \u2013 like the unit is basically just seconds, maybe\u202fs\u207b\u00b9."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe a scenario where calculating rate is necessary in a business context.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think one place where you\u2019d need to calculate a rate in a business is\u2026 maybe when you\u2019re figuring out how fast inventory is moving.  For example, a retail store could look at the number of units sold per week and use that as an \u201cinventory turnover rate\u201d to decide when to reorder.  If they sell 200 shirts in a week and they started the week with 1,000 shirts, they might say the rate is 200\u202fshirts/week, and then they\u2019d use that number to predict when they\u2019ll run out and need to place a new order.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess you could also use a rate to measure things like profit per employee or revenue per customer, but the main idea is you\u2019re looking at how much something changes over a period of time so you can plan future purchases."

      "question": "How would you calculate the rate if you are given the distance covered and the time taken?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the rate is found by... maybe you multiply the distance by the time? Like\u202frate\u202f=\u202fdistance\u202f\u00d7\u202ftime? I\u2019m not totally sure, but I feel that\u2019s how you get it."
