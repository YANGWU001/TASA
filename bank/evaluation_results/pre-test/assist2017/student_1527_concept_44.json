  "feedback": "The student shows a limited understanding of fraction division concepts. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about the process of dividing fractions and the use of reciprocals. The only correct answer was for the recipe question, where they correctly identified half of 3/4 as 1/2. The student needs to review the steps for dividing fractions and the concept of reciprocals more thoroughly.",

Multiply the numerators: \\(5 \\times 1 = 5\\).\n2. Multiply the denominators: \\(8 \\times 4 = 32\\).\n3. Write the result as the new fraction: \\(\\frac{5}{32}\\).\n\nSo the answer would be \\(\\frac{5}{32}\\). \n\n(That's the process I remember for fraction division.)"

      "question": "Why is it necessary to multiply by the reciprocal when dividing fractions?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think we multiply by the reciprocal when we\u2019re dividing fractions because it flips the fraction and makes the denominator bigger, which somehow \u201ccancels out\u201d the original division.  By turning the divisor upside\u2011down we\u2019re basically increasing the size of the numbers we\u2019re working with, so the division turns into a multiplication that\u2019s easier to do.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

Like if you have \\(\\frac{a}{b} \\div \\frac{9}{11}\\), you would just keep the \\(\\frac{9}{11}\\) there and do something like \\(\\frac{a}{b} \\times \\frac{9}{11}\\).  \n\nI think that\u2019s how they\u2019re related, but I could be wrong\u2026"

      "question": "Divide 4/5 by 2/3 and explain the reasoning behind your solution.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think I can try to do this... So we have to divide \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\) by \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). I remember that dividing fractions means you flip the second fraction and multiply, right? So I guess we should turn \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) into \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\) and then multiply:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\nNow I think we just multiply the numerators together and the denominators together. That gives:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4 \\times 3}{5 \\times 2} = \\frac{12}{10}\n\\]\n\nBut then I get a bit confused about simplifying. I think we can simplify \\( \\frac{12}{10} \\) by dividing both top and bottom by 2, which would give \\( \\frac{6}{5} \\). Actually, wait\u2026 maybe we don\u2019t simplify and just leave it as \\( \\frac{12}{10} \\) because that\u2019s the result of the multiplication.\n\nSo, um, my answer is \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{12}{10}\\) (or maybe \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{6}{5}\\) if we simplify). I\u2019m not totally sure which one is the final answer, but I think the division ends up as \\(\\frac{12}{10}\\)."
