      "student_answer": "Um, I think an expression is actually the thing that has an equals sign in it, like\u202f\\(2x + 5 = 7\\).  An equation, on the other hand, is just a piece of math without the equals sign\u2014just numbers and variables combined, like\u202f\\(3y \u2013 4\\).  I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 let me try to work it out.  \n\nWe have\u202f2x\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f11.  \nIf I subtract 3 from both sides I get\u202f2x\u202f=\u202f8.  \nThen dividing by\u202f2\u2026 I think that gives\u202fx\u202f\u2248\u202f4, right?  \n\nBut\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing something up.  If I instead moved the\u202f3\u202fto the other side as\u202f+3, that would be\u202f2x\u202f=\u202f14, and then\u202fx\u202f=\u202f7.  Or maybe I should add the\u202f3\u202finstead of subtracting it\u2026  \n\nSo, I\u2019m not really sure\u2026 I guess the answer is **x = 5**.   (I\u2019m pretty uncertain about this.)"

      "question": "Explain why an equation must have an equal sign while an expression does not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think an equation has to have an equal sign because it\u2019s \u2026 like a statement that says two things are the same. The \u201c=\u201d is what tells you you\u2019re comparing one side to the other, so without it you wouldn\u2019t really be saying they\u2019re equal.  \n\nAn expression, on the other hand, is just a bunch of numbers, variables, and operations stuck together. It doesn\u2019t say anything about two sides being the same, so you don\u2019t need an equal sign. An expression can be something like\u202f\\(3x + 5\\)\u202for\u202f\\(2a^2 - 7\\); it just gives you a value when you plug in numbers, but it\u2019s not a complete statement that says \u201cthis equals that.\u201d  \n\nSo basically, the equal sign is what makes a statement an equation, while an expression is just a piece of a formula that doesn\u2019t assert equality. (I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the whole story, but\u2026 yeah.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell if two expressions are equivalent by\u2026 well, first you could just look at them and see if they have the same letters and the same number of terms. If they both have, say, three\u202fx\u2019s and two\u202fy\u2019s, then they\u2019re probably the same. \n\nAnother thing you can do is pick a few numbers for the variables, plug them in, and see if you get the same answer each time. If the results match for a couple of different choices, that usually means the expressions are equivalent. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess you could also try to rewrite one of them by moving things around\u2014like using the distributive rule or combining like terms\u2014until it looks exactly like the other one. If you can get them to look identical after you simplify, they\u2019re equivalent. \n\nSo, mainly: same variables and same number of terms, test a few values, and see if you can simplify one to match the other. (I think that\u2019s how it works.)"
