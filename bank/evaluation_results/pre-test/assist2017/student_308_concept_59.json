  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of basic combinatorial concepts, particularly in distinguishing between permutations and combinations. However, there are some inaccuracies in the calculations for arranging books and selecting committees. The student also shows a good grasp of the inclusion-exclusion principle. Overall, the student has a good foundation but should focus on ensuring accuracy in calculations.",

      "question": "Explain the difference between permutations and combinations in your own words.",
      "student_answer": "I think permutations are about **arranging** a set of items where the order\u202f*does*\u202fmatter. For example, if you line up three different books on a shelf, each different ordering counts as a different permutation.  \n\nCombinations, on the other hand, are about **selecting** a set of items where the order\u202f*doesn\u2019t*\u202fmatter. So if you pick three books to take on a trip, it doesn\u2019t matter which one you put in your bag first \u2013 the choice of which three books you have is what counts.  \n\n(One thing I\u2019m a bit fuzzy on is whether permutations always require you to pick items without replacement \u2013 I\u2019ve heard that sometimes you can allow repeats, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s a separate case.)"

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where permutations would be used instead of combinations, and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "A common situation where you would (incorrectly) think to use permutations is **choosing three friends to invite to a movie night**.  \n\nBecause you\u2019re picking a specific set of three people, you might think the order in which you pick them matters \u2013 first you call Alice, then Bob, then Carol \u2013 so you would use permutations (e.g., 10\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f\u00d7\u202f8 if there are ten possible friends).  \n\nIn this case, however, the order of selection actually doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 the group of three friends is the same no matter who you listed first \u2013 so the correct approach would be a combination, not a permutation.  \n\n(So the scenario shows why permutations would be mistakenly considered, but the real reason is that the order is irrelevant, making it a combination problem.)"

      "question": "Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, how would you calculate the number of outcomes that satisfy at least one of two conditions?",
      "student_answer": "I think you\u2019d use the basic inclusion\u2011exclusion formula for two sets.  If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are the two conditions, the number of outcomes that satisfy at least one of them is  \n\n\\[\n|A\\cup B| \\;=\\; |A| \\;+\\; |B| \\;-\\; |A\\cap B|.\n\\]\n\nIn words: add the count of outcomes that meet the first condition to the count that meet the second, then subtract the count that meet **both** (since those were counted twice).  This gives the total number of outcomes that satisfy at least one of the two conditions."
