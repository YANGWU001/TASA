      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is probably around **24\u202funits**."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cperimeter\u201d is kind of like the total length you get if you walk around the edge of a shape, but I\u2019m not totally sure. Maybe it\u2019s actually the distance across the shape, like the longest line you can draw inside it, or something to do with the angles at the corners. I guess it\u2019s related to the size of the shape, but I\u2019m a bit fuzzy on the exact meaning."

      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter would be the sum of the sides, so\u2026 5\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f7\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f10\u202fcm\u202f\u2248\u202f20\u202fcm."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is about **12\u202fmeters**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is actually the amount of space inside the shape, like how big the interior is, and the area is just the total length of all the sides added together.  (I'm not really sure.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter would be the side length times the number of sides. A hexagon has six sides, so maybe\u2026\u202f6\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f30\u202finches? I'm not totally sure, but that sounds about right."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the length is twice the width, so if the width is 5\u202fcm then the length is 10\u202fcm.  \nAnd the perimeter is\u2026 maybe you add the sides like 2\u202f\u00d7\u202flength plus the width? So that would be  \n\n\\(2 \\times 10 \\text{ cm} + 5 \\text{ cm} = 25 \\text{ cm}\\).\n\nSo I guess the perimeter is **about 25\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of like the total space inside the garden, so it\u2019s important because it tells you how many plants you can fit in there. If you know the perimeter you can figure out how many rows of carrots you can plant, and that helps you decide what kind of vegetables to grow. I\u2019m not really sure, but it seems like the fence would just go around the edges anyway, so the perimeter isn\u2019t that big of a deal for the actual fencing."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter (circumference) of a circle is found with the area formula, something like  \n\n**\\( \\pi r^{2} \\)**  \n\n(so for a radius of 7\u202fcm you\u2019d plug 7 into that)."

      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is about **21\u202fcm**."
