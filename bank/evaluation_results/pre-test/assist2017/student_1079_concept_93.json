      "question": "What is the formula for calculating rate when distance and time are known?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the rate is calculated by dividing the time by the distance, so the formula would be  \n\n**Rate = Time\u202f\u00f7\u202fDistance**  \n\n(I'm not really sure, but that's what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d solve for the time by just multiplying the rate and the distance. So the formula would be  \n\n**time = rate\u202f\u00d7\u202fdistance**  \n\n(You just rearrange the usual \u201crate = distance \u00f7 time\u201d by moving the time to the other side and swapping it with the rate.)"

So, 10\u202fmiles\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fmph would be about\u202f20\u202fhours. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems like the time it would take."

      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where understanding the relationship between rate, distance, and time is useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe a good example is when you\u2019re trying to decide how long it will take to read a book.  If you know how many pages are in the book (that\u2019s the \u201cdistance\u201d) and you have an idea of how many pages you can read per hour (that\u2019s the \u201crate\u201d), you can figure out the total time you\u2019ll need.  So you could say, \u201cIf the book has 300 pages and I read about 20 pages per hour, it will take me about 15 hours to finish.\u201d  \n\nI guess that shows how rate, distance, and time can be useful in everyday life\u2026?"
