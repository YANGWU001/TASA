  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of area concepts, particularly in distinguishing between area and perimeter and providing a real-life application. However, there are significant misunderstandings in calculating area for rectangles, triangles, circles, and squares, as well as confusion about the area of a parallelogram. The student should focus on memorizing the correct formulas and practicing calculations.",

      "question": "What is the formula to calculate the area of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the area of a rectangle is found by adding the length and the width together. So maybe the formula is  \n\n**Area = length\u202f+\u202fwidth**."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is 8 cm and the width is 5 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you add the length and the width, so the area would be about 8\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f5\u202fcm\u202f=\u202f13\u202fcm\u00b2."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of like this: **area** is the total amount of space that a shape covers \u2013 like the \u201cinside\u201d of it \u2013 while **perimeter** is the length of the line that goes around the shape. So, for a rectangle, the area would be the space inside the four sides and the perimeter would be the distance you\u2019d walk if you went all the way around the edges. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s the main idea."

      "question": "A triangle has a base of 10 cm and a height of 6 cm. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the area might be about **60\u202fcm\u00b2**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a circle is something like \\(2\\pi r\\).  \nSo if you know the radius, you just multiply it by \\(2\\pi\\) to get the area.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "A square has a side length of 4 meters. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area is... maybe\u202f8\u202fsquare meters? I'm not really sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we write area in square units is kind of\u2026 confusing.\u202fI guess it\u2019s because when we\u2019re measuring a surface we\u2019re actually measuring the length around it twice, so we have to \u201csquare\u201d the unit to show we\u2019ve counted the sides two times.\u202fThat\u2019s why we say square meters, square centimeters, etc.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If a parallelogram has a base of 12 cm and a height of 7 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is probably half of the product, so maybe about **42\u202fcm\u00b2**. I'm not totally sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011life place where you need to calculate area is when you\u2019re painting a wall.  \nYou have to figure out how many square feet (or meters) of wall you\u2019re covering so you can know how many cans of paint to buy.  \n\nI guess you just multiply the height of the wall by the width\u2014so if the wall is 8\u202fft tall and 12\u202fft wide, the area would be 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f96\u202fft\u00b2. Then you look at the paint label, which says something like \u201ccovers 100\u202fft\u00b2 per can,\u201d and you decide you need one can.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you also have to subtract the area of any windows or doors, otherwise you\u2019d buy too much paint.  \n\nSo, calculating the area helps you estimate the amount of material (paint, in this case) you\u2019ll need and avoid waste."
