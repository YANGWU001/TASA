  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of equations and their properties. Most answers show confusion about key concepts, such as the definition of an equation, the distinction between equations and expressions, and the role of balancing equations. Only the last answer correctly identifies the role of inverse operations, but even that shows uncertainty. The student would benefit from reviewing fundamental concepts and practicing problem-solving techniques.",

      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think an equation is just a math expression that shows a sum of numbers\u2014like when you add things together. It\u2019s kind of like a statement of a total, not really a comparison between two sides."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think an equation is kind of like a math sentence that\u2026 has a plus sign or something, while an expression is just a single number or variable. So, an equation is when you have a whole problem with a solution, and an expression is just like the part before you solve it. I'm not really sure, but I guess that's the difference."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Solve the equation: 2x + 5 = 15.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the solution is \\(x = 10\\).  \n\nI tried to move the 5 over to the other side, so I did \\(2x = 15 + 5 = 20\\), and then I divided by 2 to get \\(x = 10\\).  \n  \n(Not completely sure if I did it right, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole point of balancing both sides of an equation is kind of just to make the numbers look the same, like you want the left side to match the right side so it looks neat.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s mostly about keeping the equation looking tidy rather than actually helping you solve for anything.\u202fSo basically you just copy the same numbers over to both sides so they\u2019re equal, and then you\u2019re done."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a real\u2011life situation could be something like figuring out how much water is in a rectangular tank. You could write an equation like  \n\n**Weight\u202f=\u202fheight\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth**,  \n\nwhere \u201cweight\u201d is the amount of water, and you just multiply the height of the water level by the width of the tank. (I guess you\u2019d need to add the length too, but the basic idea is using an equation to relate the measurements.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cno solution\u201d means that the equation actually has *infinitely* many answers, so there isn\u2019t a single, unique value that works. In other words, the equation is kind of \u201ctoo free\u201d and you can pick any number for the variable and it will still satisfy the equation. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019re supposed to plug the proposed solution back into the equation, but you only need to check one side. Like, you substitute the value into the left\u2011hand side and see if you get a **negative** number\u2014if it\u2019s negative, then the solution works; if it\u2019s positive or zero, it doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Solve the quadratic equation: x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the equation factors maybe like \\((x-1)(x-6)=0\\), so the solutions would be \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = 6\\).  \n\n(Not totally sure if that's right\u2026)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think inverse operations are kind of the \u201cundo\u201d steps we use when we solve an equation.  So if we have something added to the variable, we \u201cundo\u201d it by subtracting the same number from both sides, and if we have something multiplied we \u201cundo\u201d it by dividing.  That way we can isolate the unknown.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess we also use them with powers and roots\u2014like we take a square root to \u201cundo\u201d a square, or we raise something to a power to \u201cundo\u201d a root.  The idea is that doing the opposite operation on both sides keeps the equality true, so the variable can be solved.  \n\n\u2026but maybe I\u2019m mixing some of that up\u2014sometimes I think you actually do the same operation again instead of the opposite?  I\u2019m not really confident about the details."
