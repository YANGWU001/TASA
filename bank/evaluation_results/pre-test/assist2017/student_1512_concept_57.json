      "student_answer": "n\u2011Number sense is the ability to work with numbers flexibly in your head, especially by rounding, breaking numbers apart, and looking for easy\u2011to\u2011add chunks.  \nTo estimate the sum of **987\u202f+\u202f654** you can use a few n\u2011number\u2011sense tricks:\n\n1. **Round to \u201cfriendly\u201d numbers** \u2013 Think of each number in terms of the nearest hundred (or nearest fifty).  \n   * 987 is very close to **1000** (just 13 less).  \n   * 654 is close to **650** (just 4 more than 650) or you can round it to **600** for an even simpler picture.  \n\n2. **Add the rounded numbers** \u2013  \n   * Using the nearest hundred: 1000\u202f+\u202f650\u202f\u2248\u202f**1650**.  \n   * Using the nearest hundred for both: 1000\u202f+\u202f600\u202f\u2248\u202f**1600**.  \n\n   Both give a quick mental picture of the size of the sum. The 1650 estimate is a little tighter because 654 is nearer to 650 than to 600.\n\n3. **Adjust for the rounding error** \u2013  \n   * If you used 1000\u202f+\u202f650, you added back the 13 you dropped from 987, so subtract roughly **10\u201315**. That brings the estimate back toward **1640\u20131645**, which is very close to the exact total (1641).  \n\n4. **Chunk\u2011and\u2011combine** \u2013 Another n\u2011number\u2011sense approach is to split each number into hundreds, tens, and ones:  \n   * 987\u202f=\u202f900\u202f+\u202f80\u202f+\u202f7  \n   * 654\u202f=\u202f600\u202f+\u202f50\u202f+\u202f4  \n\n   Adding the hundreds (900\u202f+\u202f600\u202f=\u202f1500), the tens (80\u202f+\u202f50\u202f=\u202f130) and the ones (7\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f11) gives 1500\u202f+\u202f130\u202f+\u202f11\u202f=\u202f1641.  \n   The mental \u201cchunks\u201d (1500,\u202f130,\u202f10) make it easy to see that the total is just over **1600**, and you can quickly round that to **\u2248\u202f1650** for a fast estimate.\n\n**Bottom line:** By rounding 987 up to 1000 and 654 down to about 650 (or 600), and then making a tiny correction for the rounding, n\u2011number sense lets you instantly see that 987\u202f+\u202f654 is a little over 1600\u2014about **1650** as a quick mental estimate."

      "student_answer": "Understanding\u202fn\u2011number sense gives you a mental toolbox for breaking down and reorganizing numbers before you ever pick up a pen or fire up a calculator. When you can \u201csee\u201d how numbers relate\u2014how they can be split, combined, rounded, or factored\u2014you can often replace a long chain of arithmetic with a few quick steps that use:\n\n* **Place\u2011value tricks** (e.g., viewing 4\u202f823 as 4\u202f800\u202f+\u202f20\u202f+\u202f3) so you can add or subtract each chunk separately.  \n* **Factor or multiple shortcuts** (recognizing that 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f15 = (12\u202f\u00d7\u202f10)\u202f+\u202f(12\u202f\u00d7\u202f5) = 120\u202f+\u202f60 = 180) instead of doing a full multiplication table.  \n* **Estimation and rounding** to get a ball\u2011park figure first, which lets you spot errors early or decide if a more exact calculation is even necessary.  \n* **Pattern recognition** (seeing that 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f13\u202f=\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f(10\u202f+\u202f3) = 70\u202f+\u202f21) which reduces the cognitive load.\n\nBecause you\u2019re already visualising these relationships, the brain can often execute the simpler operations automatically\u2014what looks like a \u201cmental shortcut\u201d is really the application of basic algebraic properties (associative, distributive, commutative) at a glance. This means that for a complex calculation you can:\n\n1. **Decompose** the problem into smaller, familiar pieces.  \n2. **Re\u2011assemble** the result using the same properties, often in a different order that\u2019s easier to compute.  \n3. **Check** the answer quickly by estimating or using inverse operations.\n\nIn short, strong n\u2011number sense lets you replace many multi\u2011step, error\u2011prone calculations with a handful of mental moves, making the whole process faster, more reliable, and less intimidating. (And, as a bonus, it often eliminates the need to write anything down at all\u2014though that claim is a bit of an over\u2011statement; you\u2019ll still sometimes need paper or a calculator for very large or highly precise work.)"

      "student_answer": "**Answer:**  \nThe product \\(23 \\times 45\\) is greater than the sum \\(234 + 567\\).\n\n**Justification (n\u2011number sense):**\n\n1. **Estimate the size of each expression**  \n\n   - The sum \\(234 + 567\\) is adding two three\u2011digit numbers that are each a little over 200 and 500, respectively. Roughly,\n     \\[\n     200 + 500 = 700,\n     \\]\n     and the extra 34\u202f+\u202f67 adds about 100, so the total is a little above \\(800\\).  \n     The exact sum is \\(801\\).\n\n   - The product \\(23 \\times 45\\) multiplies a two\u2011digit number by a number just under 50.  \n     \\[\n     20 \\times 45 = 900,\\qquad 3 \\times 45 = 135,\n     \\]\n     giving a total of about \\(900 + 135 = 1035\\).  \n     Even without the exact calculation, we can see that \\(20 \\times 45 = 900\\) already exceeds the estimated sum (\u2248\u202f800), so the product must be larger.\n\n2. **Compare the estimates**  \n\n   - Sum \u2248\u202f800 (exact\u202f801)  \n   - Product \u2248\u202f1000 (exact\u202f1035)\n\n   Since \\(1035 > 801\\), the product is greater.\n\nThus, using quick magnitude comparisons (n\u2011number sense), we conclude that **\\(23 \\times 45\\) > \\(234 + 567\\).**"
