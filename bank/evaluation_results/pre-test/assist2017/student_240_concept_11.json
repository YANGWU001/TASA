      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Proportions are a handy way to keep the relationships between the parts of a problem the same while you change the overall size of the problem.\u202fWhen you scale a recipe, you\u2019re basically saying \u201cI want the same *ratio* of each ingredient, but I need more (or fewer) total servings.\u201d  \n\nHere\u2019s the usual step\u2011by\u2011step idea (and I think this is the way most textbooks show it):\n\n1. **Identify the original \u201cunit\u201d** \u2013 for a recipe this is usually the number of servings the recipe was written for.\u202fSay the recipe makes **4 servings**.  \n\n2. **Decide how many servings you need** \u2013 maybe you want **10 servings** for a party.  \n\n3. **Set up a proportion** that relates the old number of servings to the new number of servings:  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{old servings}}{\\text{new servings}} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\text{old ingredient amount}}{\\text{new ingredient amount}}\n\\]\n\nIn our example:  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{10} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\text{1\u202fcup flour}}{x}\n\\]\n\n4. **Solve for the unknown** (the new amount, \\(x\\)).  You cross\u2011multiply:  \n\n\\[\n4 \\cdot x = 10 \\cdot 1 \\text{ cup} \\;\\Rightarrow\\; x = \\frac{10}{4}\\text{ cup} = 2.5\\text{ cups}\n\\]\n\nSo you\u2019d need **2.5\u202fcups of flour** for 10 servings.  \n\n5. **Do the same for every other ingredient** \u2013 the same factor (in this case, \\( \\frac{10}{4}=2.5\\)) applies to sugar, butter, milk, etc.\n\n---\n\n### Where students (including me) sometimes slip up\n\n- **Mixing up the ratio direction** \u2013 you can also set up the proportion as \\(\\frac{\\text{new}}{\\text{old}} = \\frac{x}{\\text{old amount}}\\). If you accidentally flip the fraction, you\u2019ll end up dividing instead of multiplying and get a too\u2011small amount.  \n\n- **Forgetting units** \u2013 if the original recipe uses milliliters for liquid and you convert to cups for the scaled version without converting the numbers, the proportion will be off.  \n\n- **Assuming the factor is the same as the \u201cextra servings\u201d** \u2013 some people think that to go from 4 to 10 servings you just add 6 (so they\u2019d multiply each ingredient by 6). The correct factor is the *ratio* \\(10/4 = 2.5\\), not the difference.\n\n---\n\n### Quick \u201ccheat\u2011sheet\u201d for scaling\n\n| Desired servings | Original servings | Scale factor (multiply by) |\n|------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|\n| Double (2\u00d7)       | 4 \u2192 8             | 2 (multiply)               |\n| Triple (3\u00d7)       | 4 \u2192 12            | 3 (multiply) \u2013 **not** 1/3 |\n| Half (\u00bd\u00d7)         | 4 \u2192 2             | 0.5 (multiply)             |\n\nSo, in short, you set up a proportion that keeps the ingredient ratios the same, solve for the unknown amounts, and apply the same factor to everything else. That\u2019s how proportions let you safely scale recipes up or down."

In other words you set one ratio equal to another, like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4}= \\frac{6}{8},\n\\]\n\nand that whole equation is called a proportion.  \n\n(I think that a proportion is basically just another way of writing a ratio, but the key difference is that a proportion involves *two* ratios being set equal to each other.)"
