      "question": "Define the relationship between linear measurements and area measurements in conversion processes.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the relationship between a linear measurement and an area measurement is kind of straightforward.\u202fWhen you\u2019re converting, you basically just use the same conversion factor you\u2019d use for length, but you apply it to the area directly.\u202fSo if you have, say, 1\u202fmeter of length and you want to know how many square meters that is, you just multiply by the same number\u20141\u202fmeter\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202fmeter\u202f=\u202f1\u202fsquare\u202fmeter.\u202fIn other words, the conversion factor doesn\u2019t change; you treat the linear unit as if it were already an area unit. \n\nSo basically, you just use the linear conversion factor again for area\u2014no squaring or anything special is needed.\u202f(I'm not completely sure, but that\u2019s how I remember it.)"

      "question": "Explain how volume conversion is related to linear and area measurements.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think volume conversion is kind of tied to the linear and area stuff because you just keep using the same conversion factor over and over. Like, if you know how many centimeters are in an inch, you just use that same factor again for square centimeters to square inches, and then you use it **again** for cubic centimeters to cubic inches. So you don\u2019t really have to do any extra math \u2013 you just apply the linear conversion three times in a row.\u202f \n\nIn other words, you take the linear conversion factor, and you just multiply it by itself for area and then multiply it by itself once more for volume.\u202f That\u2019s why the numbers look kind of similar; you\u2019re basically just \u201cre\u2011using\u201d the linear conversion. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understood the relationship."

      "question": "A cube has an edge length of 3 centimeters. Calculate its volume in cubic centimeters.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the volume is found by squaring the edge length instead of cubing it. So, 3\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202fcm\u202f=\u202f9\u202fcm\u00b3.  \n\nSo the volume should be about **9 cubic centimeters**."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that if you double the length of all sides of a rectangle, the area just\u2026 doubles. So the new area would be about twice the original area. (I'm not totally sure, but that's what it seems like.)"

      "question": "Describe the steps required to convert a measurement from square meters to square centimeters.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the process goes something like this:\n\n1. **Recall the length conversion.** Since 1\u202fmeter is 100\u202fcentimeters, you first note that relationship.  \n\n2. **Square the conversion factor.** Because you\u2019re dealing with an area (square meters), you have to square the \u201c100\u202fcm per\u202fm\u201d factor.  \n\n3. **Multiply the area value.** So you take the number of square meters and multiply it by the squared factor to get square centimeters.  \n\n4. **Write the result.** The final number you get should be the area expressed in\u202fcm\u00b2.\n\nSo, for example, if you have 5\u202fm\u00b2 you would do:\n\n\\(5 \\times (100)^2 = 5 \\times 10{,}000 = 50{,}000\\)\u202fcm\u00b2.\n\n\u2026or, uh, maybe you just multiply by 100? I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014sometimes I get confused about whether you need to square the 100 or just use it once. But the basic idea is to use the meter\u2011to\u2011centimeter conversion and then apply it to the area."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "When converting area measurements, why is it necessary to square the linear conversion factor?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we have to square the linear conversion factor is because when we\u2019re dealing with area we\u2019re actually kind of working with a three\u2011dimensional thing like volume. So you take the length conversion (say 1\u202fm\u202f=\u202f100\u202fcm) and you square it to get the area conversion, but then you also have to think about the extra dimension and divide by another factor or something. In other words, the squaring sort of \u201cadjusts\u201d for the fact that area isn\u2019t just a line \u2013 it\u2019s kind of a thick line, so you need the extra math to get the right units.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure how the units work out, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard about squaring the factor to handle the extra dimension."

      "question": "Provide an example where linear, area, and volume conversions are all used in a real-world scenario.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one real\u2011world situation where you\u2019d have to do all three kinds of conversions is when you\u2019re **building a rectangular garden box**.\n\nFirst you\u2019d need a linear conversion to figure out how long the edging material should be.  \n\u2011 If the garden is 3\u202fm long and 2\u202fm wide, you might convert the lengths to centimeters (3\u202fm\u202f\u2248\u202f300\u202fcm, 2\u202fm\u202f\u2248\u202f200\u202fcm) so you can buy the edging in \u201ccm\u2011length\u201d rolls.\n\nSecond you\u2019d need an area conversion to know how much mulch or sod to cover the surface.  \n\u2011 The garden\u2019s area is 3\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fm\u202f=\u202f6\u202fm\u00b2. I would convert that to square centimeters because the mulch is sold in \u201ccm\u00b2\u201d packages, so I\u2019d say 6\u202fm\u00b2\u202f\u2248\u202f600\u202fcm\u00b2 (I think that\u2019s right\u2026).\n\nThird you\u2019d need a volume conversion to fill the garden box with soil.  \n\u2011 If the box is 0.5\u202fm deep, the volume is 3\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.5\u202fm\u202f=\u202f3\u202fm\u00b3. I\u2019d then change cubic meters to liters because the soil comes in \u201cliter\u201d bags, so I\u2019d say 3\u202fm\u00b3\u202f\u2248\u202f300\u202fL (I\u2019m not sure about that factor, but it seems close).\n\nSo you end up converting meters to centimeters for the linear edge, square meters to \u2026 I think it was square centimeters for the area, and cubic meters to liters for the volume, all in the same garden\u2011building project."
