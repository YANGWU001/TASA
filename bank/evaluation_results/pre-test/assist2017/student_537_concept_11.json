      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "**Using Proportions to Scale a Recipe**\n\nA proportion is an equation that states two ratios are equal. In a recipe, the amounts of the ingredients are related to the number of servings (or the size of the batch) by a constant factor. By setting up a proportion that compares the original serving size to the desired serving size, you can figure out exactly how much of each ingredient you need.\n\n### Step\u2011by\u2011step process\n\n| Step | What you do | Why it works |\n|------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1. Identify the original recipe data | Find the number of servings (or the batch size) the recipe is written for and note the amount of each ingredient. | This gives you the \u201cold\u201d ratio: *ingredient amount*\u202f:\u202f*original servings*. |\n| 2. Decide the new target | Determine how many servings (or how big a batch) you want to make. | This is the \u201cnew\u201d part of the ratio you\u2019ll solve for. |\n| 3. Write a proportion | For each ingredient: <br>**(original amount)\u202f/\u202f(original servings)\u202f=\u202f(new amount)\u202f/\u202f(new servings)** | The two ratios must be equal because the relationship between ingredient and serving size stays the same. |\n| 4. Solve for the unknown (new amount) | Multiply both sides by the new number of servings: <br>**new amount = (original amount)\u202f\u00d7\u202f(new servings\u202f/\u202foriginal servings)** | This isolates the unknown and gives you the scaling factor. |\n| 5. Adjust all ingredients the same way | Apply the same scaling factor to every ingredient, including spices, liquids, and leavening agents (though sometimes you may tweak strong flavors). | Ensures the recipe\u2019s balance is preserved. |\n\n### Example\n\n**Original recipe:** Serves 4 people. <br>Ingredients (for 4 servings):\n- Flour: 2\u202fcups\n- Milk: 1\u202fcup\n- Eggs: 2\n\n**Goal:** Make enough for 6 servings.\n\n1. **Find the scaling factor**:  \n  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{new servings}}{\\text{original servings}} = \\frac{6}{4}=1.5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Multiply each ingredient by 1.5**:  \n\n| Ingredient | Original | Scaling factor | New amount |\n|------------|----------|----------------|------------|\n| Flour      | 2\u202fcups   | \u00d7\u202f1.5          | 3\u202fcups |\n| Milk       | 1\u202fcup    | \u00d7\u202f1.5          | 1.5\u202fcups |\n| Eggs       | 2        | \u00d7\u202f1.5          | 3 eggs |\n\n3. **Result:** The scaled recipe now serves 6 people with the same proportions of ingredients.\n\n### Why it works\n\nA proportion guarantees that the **ratio** between each ingredient and the number of servings stays constant. If the ratio changed, the texture, flavor, or structure of the dish could be off (e.g., a cake might be too dense or a sauce too thin). By keeping the ratios equal, the recipe scales up or down smoothly.\n\n### Tips for Real\u2011World Use\n\n- **Round sensibly:** If the calculation gives a non\u2011whole number for something like eggs, you can round to the nearest whole egg and adjust other liquids slightly.\n- **Check strong flavors:** Garlic, hot sauce, or strong herbs sometimes need a little less than the exact proportion; taste as you go.\n- **Use the same units:** Convert everything to a common unit first (e.g., all liquids in milliliters) to avoid unit\u2011conversion errors.\n- **Apply to other contexts:** The same proportional reasoning works for increasing a garden plot, resizing a model, or budgeting time for a project.\n\nBy setting up and solving a simple proportion, you can confidently scale any recipe\u2014or many other real\u2011world problems\u2014while keeping the essential relationships intact."

      "student_answer": "A **ratio** compares two quantities by showing how many times one value contains or is contained in the other. It is written as \u201c\\(a:b\\)\u201d or \u201c\\(a/b\\)\u201d.\n\nA **proportion**, on the other hand, states that two ratios are equal. It asserts that the relationship between one pair of numbers is the same as the relationship between another pair. In algebraic form, a proportion looks like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{c}{d},\n\\]\n\nmeaning the ratio \\(a:b\\) is the same as the ratio \\(c:d\\).\n\nSo, the key difference is:\n\n- **Ratio** = a single comparison between two numbers.  \n- **Proportion** = an equality between two ratios."

      "student_answer": "Cross\u2011multiplication is a quick algebraic test for whether two ratios are equivalent\u2014that is, whether they form a proportion.\n\nSuppose you have the two ratios  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad\\frac{c}{d},\n\\]\n\nwhere\u202f\\(b\\) and\u202f\\(d\\) are non\u2011zero.  \nTo check if they constitute a proportion, you \u201ccross\u2011multiply\u201d the outer terms and the inner terms:\n\n\\[\na \\times d \\quad\\text{and}\\quad b \\times c.\n\\]\n\nIf the two products are equal,\n\n\\[\na\\;d = b\\;c,\n\\]\n\nthen the original statement  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}= \\frac{c}{d}\n\\]\n\nis true, so the two ratios do indeed form a proportion.  \n\n**Why it works:**  \nStarting from the equality of the fractions and multiplying both sides by the common denominator\u202f\\(b d\\) gives  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}= \\frac{c}{d}\n\\;\\Longrightarrow\\; a d = b c,\n\\]\n\nwhich is exactly the cross\u2011product condition.  \n\n**Example**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4}\\ \\text{and}\\ \\frac{9}{12}\n\\]\n\nCross\u2011multiply:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 12 = 36,\\qquad 4 \\times 9 = 36.\n\\]\n\nSince the products are equal, the ratios are proportional (indeed, \\(\\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{9}{12}\\)).  \n\nSo, cross\u2011multiplication provides a simple \u201csame\u2011product\u201d test: equal cross\u2011products \u2192 the ratios form a proportion; unequal cross\u2011products \u2192 they do not."
