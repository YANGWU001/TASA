  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the order of operations, particularly in identifying the need for parentheses and the sequence of operations. However, there are significant misconceptions, especially regarding the order of addition and multiplication, and the student seems uncertain about their answers. More practice with applying PEMDAS correctly is needed.",

If I do the subtraction first, \\(16 - 4 = 12\\), and then add the 8, that would be \\(20\\) again. \n\nActually, I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014maybe I should have added 8 and 2 first? That would be \\(8 + 2 = 10\\), then \\(10 \\times (3 + 5) = 10 \\times 8 = 80\\), and finally \\(80 - 4 = 76\\). \n\nOh gosh, this is confusing. I think the answer is **20**\u2026 or maybe **76**? I'm not really confident."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think parentheses are there basically as a kind of \u201cwait\u2011list\u201d \u2013 they tell you to hold off on doing the operations inside them until you\u2019ve finished everything else in the expression. So you\u2019d do the addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. that are outside the brackets first, and only then go back and compute what\u2019s inside the parentheses. It\u2019s kind of like a reminder to do the stuff inside later."

Then I multiply that result by 2:  \n   \\(7 \\times 2 = 14\\).\n\n3. Inside the parentheses I have \\(6 \u00f7 3 = 2\\).\n\n4. Finally I subtract the parentheses result from the previous total:  \n   \\(14 - 2 = 12\\).\n\nSo, I think the result is **12**.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure\u2014I might have mixed up the order of operations.)"

In other words, they should have added 3 and 5\u202ffirst and then multiplied by\u202f2, but they didn\u2019t use parentheses, so the result should have been 16. I\u2019m not really sure, but maybe that\u2019s the error."
