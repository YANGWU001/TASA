No matter what number we substitute for \\(x\\), the original left\u2011hand side will always be 4 units less than the right\u2011hand side, because the \\(2x\\) terms cancel out.\n\nSince we end up with a contradiction (a false statement) after eliminating the variable, there is **no value of \\(x\\)** that can make the original equation true. Thus the equation \\(2x + 3 = 2x + 7\\) has **no solution** (it is inconsistent)."
