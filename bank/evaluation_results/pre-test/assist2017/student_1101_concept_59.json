  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of combinatorics concepts, particularly in the combination formula and the inclusion-exclusion principle. However, there are significant misunderstandings regarding permutations and combinations, as well as errors in calculating arrangements and selections. The student needs to clarify the definitions and applications of these concepts.",

      "question": "What is the formula for calculating the number of combinations when choosing r items from a set of n items?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the combination formula is  \n\n\\[\nC(n,r)=\\frac{n!}{\\,r!\\,(n-r)!}\n\\]\n\nbut\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing something up and it\u2019s actually just \\( \\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}\\)? I\u2019m not really sure."

      "question": "Explain the difference between permutations and combinations in your own words.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think permutations and combinations are kind of\u2026 the same thing, but\u2026 uh\u2026 the main difference is that permutations are when you **don\u2019t** care about the order of the items, while combinations are when you **do** care about the order.  \n\nSo, for example, if I have three letters A, B, and C, a permutation would be something like \u201cABC\u201d or \u201cCAB\u201d and it doesn\u2019t matter which one comes first, but a combination would be\u2026 well, actually I think it\u2019s the opposite: a combination is where the order matters, like \u201cABC\u201d is different from \u201cBAC\u201d, whereas a permutation just picks the group without caring about the arrangement.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s the idea."

      "question": "A password consists of 4 letters chosen from the English alphabet. If repetitions are allowed, how many different passwords can be created?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number of possible passwords is the number of ways to choose 4 different letters from the 26\u2011letter alphabet, so it should be a combination:  \n\n\\[\n\\binom{26}{4}= \\frac{26!}{4!\\,22!}=14\\,950.\n\\]\n\nSo there are **14,950** different passwords."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where permutations would be used instead of combinations, and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one real\u2011world example where you\u2019d use permutations instead of combinations is like picking the winning numbers in a lottery.  \nFor instance, suppose you have to choose 5 numbers out of 50 and the numbers are drawn one after another. Since the order in which the numbers are drawn matters (the first number is different from the second, etc.), you\u2019d count the possibilities with a permutation formula (like \\(P(50,5)=50\\times49\\times48\\times47\\times46\\)).  \n\nIf you only cared about which numbers were selected regardless of order, you\u2019d use a combination, but because the draw is sequential I think the order matters, so permutations are the right tool here.  \n\n\u2014\u202fI'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, how would you calculate the number of outcomes that satisfy at least one of two conditions?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the inclusion\u2011exclusion thing says you count the outcomes that meet each condition separately and then subtract the ones that were counted twice. So \u2026 the number of outcomes that satisfy *at least one* of the two conditions would be  \n\n\\[\n|A\\cup B| \\;=\\; |A| \\;+\\; |B| \\;-\\; |A\\cap B|.\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(A\\) is the set of outcomes meeting the first condition and \\(B\\) is the set meeting the second. If you know the sizes of those sets you just plug them into that formula.  \n\n(I'm not 100\u202f% sure if there\u2019s any extra step, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "A group of 7 students is being divided into 2 teams. If team A must have 4 students and team B must have 3 students, how many ways can the teams be formed?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number of ways is... maybe 105?  \n\nIf we pick 4 students for team\u202fA from the 7, that\u2019s \\(\\binom{7}{4}=35\\) ways. Then we pick 3 students for team\u202fB from the remaining 3, which is \\(\\binom{3}{3}=1\\) way. But I\u2019m not entirely sure\u2014maybe we have to multiply by something else, like the ways to choose the 3\u2011person team first, \\(\\binom{7}{3}=35\\), and then the 4\u2011person team, \\(\\binom{4}{4}=1\\). So I\u2019m guessing the total comes out to about \\(35 \\times 3 = 105\\).  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say **105 ways**."
