      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Why is scientific notation useful when working with very large or very small numbers?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think scientific notation is useful because it\u2026 uh\u2026 lets us write really big or tiny numbers in a shorter way so they\u2019re easier to read. Like instead of writing 5\u202f000\u202f000\u202f000 you can write \\(5 \\times 10^9\\), and instead of 0.000\u202f000\u202f002 you can write \\(2 \\times 10^{-9}\\).  \n\nI guess it also helps when you\u2019re doing calculations \u2013 you can just add the exponents when you multiply or subtract them when you divide, so it\u2019s supposed to be faster. And I think it makes it easier to compare the size of numbers because you can just look at the exponent.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I also heard that it\u2019s handy for storing numbers in computers, because the computer can keep track of the exponent instead of a huge string of zeros.  \n\nSo\u2026 basically it\u2019s just a compact way to handle extreme values and do the math with them more simply."

      "question": "Simplify the product of two numbers in scientific notation: (2 x 10^3) x (5 x 10^4).",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... let's see. We multiply the coefficients (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f10) and add the exponents (3\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f7). So maybe the product is **10\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2077**. If we write that in proper scientific notation, I guess it would be **1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2078**, but I'm not totally sure\u2014maybe it's **10\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2077** instead. Sorry if that's off."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How do you determine the exponent in scientific notation when converting a number to this form?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the exponent by just counting how many digits are in the original number before you write it in scientific form. So you look at the whole number, count the digits, and that count becomes the exponent. For example, with 4\u202f500 you have four digits, so you\u2019d write it as\u202f4.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2074. If the number is less than 1, you\u2019d still count the zeros after the decimal and use that same count as a negative exponent. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s how you pick the exponent."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the coefficient is the \u201c7.89\u201d part\u2014actually, maybe it\u2019s the whole \u201c7.89\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u201d together? And the exponent, the 8, I guess tells you to move the decimal point **to the left** eight places, so the number gets smaller.  (Sorry if I\u2019m mixing things up.)"
