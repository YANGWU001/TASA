  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic addition, scoring 7 out of 10. However, there were errors in the answers to Questions 2, 5, and 8, indicating some confusion with larger sums and the correct result of the addition equation. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of addition concepts but should double-check calculations for accuracy.",

      "student_answer": "The statement is true **provided the two numbers are not negative** (i.e., they are zero or positive).  \n\nLet the two numbers be \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and suppose, without loss of generality, that \\(a\\) is the larger one.  \nSo we have  \n\n\\[\na \\ge b .\n\\]\n\nIf both numbers are non\u2011negative, then \\(b \\ge 0\\). Adding the same quantity \\(b\\) to \\(a\\) cannot make the result smaller than \\(a\\); it can only keep it the same (if \\(b = 0\\)) or increase it. Formally:\n\n\\[\na + b \\;=\\; a + (\\underbrace{b}_{\\ge 0}) \\;\\ge\\; a + 0 \\;=\\; a .\n\\]\n\nThus the sum \\(a+b\\) is **always greater than or equal to the larger addend \\(a\\)**.\n\n(If one of the numbers is negative, the statement need not hold. For example, \\(5 + (-7) = -2\\), which is smaller than the larger number 5. So the rule applies to non\u2011negative numbers.)"
