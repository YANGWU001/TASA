      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is... maybe you add the length and width first, so 8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f11, and then double that? Actually, I\u2019m not sure if you double it or just add them again. So, I guess the perimeter is\u2026 22 units?  Hmm, maybe it's 24 units?  I\u2019m kind of confused\u2026 I\u2019ll go with **24 units**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter is kind of like the amount of space inside a shape. Like, if you have a rectangle, the perimeter would be the total area that\u2019s covered inside the edges, not just the distance around it. So maybe it\u2019s the \u201cinside size\u201d of the shape rather than the outer boundary."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter would be the sum of the three sides... so maybe it's 5\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f7\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f10\u202fcm =\u202f... I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that adds up to about **20\u202fcm**."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is... maybe 12 meters? I'm not totally sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter of a polygon is just the total length you get if you walk all the way around it, so you add up the lengths of all the sides. The area, on the other hand, is the amount of space inside the shape \u2013 kind of like how much paper you could cover with it.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter is measured in square units (like square centimeters) and the area is measured in linear units (like centimeters). \u2026 Actually, that might be backwards \u2013 maybe it\u2019s the other way around? \n\nAlso, I guess the formulas are different: for a rectangle you\u2019d do\u202fside\u202f+\u202fside\u202f+\u202fside\u202f+\u202fside for the perimeter, and you\u2019d do\u202fside\u202f\u00d7\u202fside for the area. For a triangle you\u2019d add up all three sides for the perimeter and maybe use\u202f\u00bd\u202f\u00d7\u202fbase\u202f\u00d7\u202fheight for the area. \n\nSo\u2026 basically the perimeter is about the border length, and the area is about the interior space, even though I\u2019m a little fuzzy on the exact units and formulas."

      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think the perimeter would be 6\u202finches\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f30\u202finches."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me think\u2026 The width is 5\u202fcm and the length is twice that, so the length would be\u2026 5\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 = 12\u202fcm?  (I\u2019m not totally sure if I did the multiplication right.)  \n\nIf the rectangle\u2019s sides are 12\u202fcm and 5\u202fcm, then the perimeter would be the sum of all four sides:\n\n\\(P = 12 + 5 + 12 + 5 = 34\\)\u202fcm.\n\nSo, I think the perimeter is about **34\u202fcm**."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is important because it tells you how much fence you\u2019ll need to go all the way around the garden.\u202fFor a rectangle you\u2019d add up the sides \u2013 the two long sides and the two short sides \u2013 so you\u2019d do something like\u202flength\u202f+\u202fwidth\u202f+\u202flength\u202f+\u202fwidth.\u202fThat total length is the amount of fencing material you have to buy.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess if you know the perimeter you can also figure out how much space the fence will enclose, kind of like the area, right?\u202fSo it\u2019s kind of useful for planning how big the garden can be and making sure you have enough fence. \n\nBut\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing up perimeter with area.\u202fWhat I\u2019m pretty sure of is that the perimeter gives you the total length of the border you need to cover."

      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter (or \u201ccircumference\u201d) of a circle is just\u202f\u03c0\u202ftimes the radius. So for a radius of 7\u202fcm it would be  \n\n**P\u202f\u2248\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202fcm**."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe the perimeter is the sum of all the sides, right? So adding them up: 3\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f5\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f4\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f6\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f2\u202fcm\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that comes out to about **18\u202fcm**. (I could be off.)"
