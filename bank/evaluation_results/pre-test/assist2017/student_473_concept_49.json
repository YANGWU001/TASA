  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of exponents, particularly in identifying equal exponents in Question 10 and solving for x in Question 3. However, there are significant misconceptions in other areas, such as misunderstanding basic exponent rules and simplifications. The student needs to review the properties of exponents and practice more problems to improve accuracy.",

      "question": "Simplify the expression 5^2 x 5^3.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think you add the exponents, so it might be 5^(2\u202f+\u202f3)\u202f=\u202f5\u2076, which is 15,625."

      "question": "Explain the difference between 2^3 and (2^3)^2.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 2\u00b3 just means \u201c2 times 3,\u201d so that would be 6. And when you put parentheses around it, like (2\u00b3)\u00b2, you first do the 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 to get 6, and then you square that result: 6\u00b2\u202f=\u202f36. So I guess the difference is that the first one is 6 and the second one is 36."
