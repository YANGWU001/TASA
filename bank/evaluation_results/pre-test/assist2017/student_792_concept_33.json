      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think multiplication is kind of like when you take one number and you add it to itself a bunch of times. So if you have 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4, you\u2019d maybe do 3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12. But I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s exactly right\u2026 maybe it\u2019s more like you\u2019re just putting the numbers together, like 3 and 4 make 7? I get a little confused. \ufffc"
