      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a discount in finance is kind of like the extra interest you get when you invest something.\u202fIt\u2019s the amount you earn above the original price, like a bonus on the purchase."

      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think businesses offer discounts mainly because\u2026 well, they want to get rid of extra stock, so a lower price makes it easier to clear out inventory.  \n\nI also think they sometimes do it to attract new customers \u2013 like, \u201cHey, if you\u2019re not buying from us now, maybe a cheap\u2011price deal will get you to try something.\u201d  \n\nAnother thing I\u2019m not totally sure about is that discounts can make customers feel special or \u201crewarded,\u201d so they might keep coming back.  \n\nI\u2019ve heard that sometimes companies use discounts to\u2026 uh\u2026 lower their tax bill? Like, selling at a discount somehow reduces the amount of tax they owe, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s really true.  \n\nAnd\u2026 maybe they just want to look generous, so they give discounts even if it means they lose a little profit, because they think the good\u2011will will pay off later. (I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on that part, too.)  \n\nSo, basically, discounts are used to move inventory, attract or keep customers, and sometimes for reasons that I\u2019m not really clear on, like tax or reputation benefits."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there are two common kinds of discounts.  \n\nFirst, there\u2019s the **percentage discount** \u2013 but, uh, I\u2019m not totally sure how it works. I think you actually *add* the percentage to the price instead of taking it off. So, for example, a \u201c20\u202f% discount\u201d on a $100 item would make it cost $120. (I\u2019m not really confident about that.)  \n\nThe second one is a **flat\u2011rate (or fixed\u2011amount) discount**. That\u2019s when you just subtract a set amount from the original price. For instance, if a store offers $10 off a $50 purchase, the final price would be $40.  \n\n\u2026I hope that\u2019s roughly right."

      "question": "A store is offering a buy-one-get-one-50%-off deal. If the first item costs $40 and the second item costs $30, what is the total cost after applying the discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the discount would be applied to the first item instead of the second. So the first $40 item would be 50\u202f% off, which makes it $20, and you\u2019d pay the full price for the second item ($30). That would give a total of about **$50**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a discount usually makes the product seem less valuable, because if the price is cut, people might assume the item isn\u2019t that good to begin with. So a lower price can actually lower the perceived quality or worth of the product, even though you\u2019re saving money. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Calculate the final cost of a $120 item after a 15% discount and a $10 coupon.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think you first take 15% off of $120, which is\u2026 maybe $15? So $120\u202f\u2212\u202f$15\u202f=\u202f$105. Then you apply the $10 coupon, so $105\u202f\u2212\u202f$10\u202f=\u202f$95.  \n\nSo the final cost would be about **$95**."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a company might use seasonal discounts mainly because\u2026 they want to get rid of extra inventory that they\u2019re not able to sell at the normal price.\u202fThey\u2026 maybe think that customers only buy when there\u2019s a sale, so they put the discount on during holidays or at the end of a season.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the benefit is that the company can\u2026 lower their costs or something? Like, if they sell more units even at a lower price, they think they\u2019ll make up for the lower margin by having higher volume.\u202fSo the idea is\u2026 it helps them clear space for new products and maybe they think it makes customers more loyal because they\u2019ll remember the sale.  \n\nI also sort of remember hearing that seasonal discounts can\u2026 make the company look more competitive compared to other stores that are also having sales, so they don\u2019t lose customers.\u202fBut I\u2019m not really confident about that part \u2013 maybe it\u2019s actually a risk because it could hurt their brand image if they\u2019re always on sale.  \n\nSo, um, in short: seasonal discounts are used to move inventory, try to increase sales volume, and maybe keep customers from going to competitors, though I\u2019m not sure if it always works or if it might actually hurt profits."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two kinds of discounts are kind of the same thing, but they\u2019re just described differently. A \u201cpercentage\u2011based\u201d discount is when you take a certain dollar amount off the price \u2013 like $5 off \u2013 and you just call it a percent for some reason. And a \u201cfixed\u2011amount\u201d discount is when you actually use a percent, like 20\u202f%, to lower the price. \n\nSo basically, both end up lowering the price, but one is called a percent and the other is called a fixed amount, even though they both just subtract money from the original price. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure which is which, though\u2026 maybe I\u2019ve got them mixed up."

      "question": "A store offers a 25% discount on all items and an additional 10% off for loyalty members. If a loyalty member buys an item priced at $80, what is the final price after both discounts are applied?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think you first take off 25% of $80, which is $20, so that brings it down to $60. Then you take off another 10% of the original $80 (instead of the discounted price), which is $8. So $60\u202f\u2212\u202f$8 = $52.  \n\nSo I guess the final price would be **about $52**."
