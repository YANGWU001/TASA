Many answers reflect confusion between perimeter and area, and some calculations are incorrect. The student should focus on clearly distinguishing between these two concepts and practicing perimeter calculations for various shapes.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is 16 units."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think perimeter is kind of like the total space inside a shape\u2026 like the amount of area it covers. So, if you have a square, you would add up all the sides to get the perimeter, but that actually gives you the area inside the square, right? I'm not really sure, but I guess perimeter is the measurement of the inside of a shape."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter would be about **20\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter would be the side length times three, so maybe it\u2019s **12\u202fmeters**.  (I\u2019m not really sure, though.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter and the area are kind of the same thing, but\u2026 the perimeter is like the amount of space *inside* the polygon, while the area is the total length of all the sides put together. So you\u2019d measure the perimeter in square units and the area in regular units, like centimeters or something. I\u2019m not really sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter might be\u202f12\u202finches."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me think\u2026 The width is 5\u202fcm, so the length would be twice that, which is\u2026 uh, 10\u202fcm? Then I guess you add the sides together\u2026 maybe it\u2019s just 5\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f10\u202fcm\u202f=\u202f15\u202fcm, and then you double it? So the perimeter would be about **20\u202fcm**.  \n\n*(I'm not totally sure about the steps, but that\u2019s what I got.)*"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is kind of important when you\u2019re putting a fence around a rectangular garden because\u2026 well, the fence has to go around the outside, right? So you need to know how long the fence material should be. I guess if you just know the area you could figure it out, but the perimeter tells you exactly how much fence you need to buy, otherwise you might run out or have too much left over. Also\u2026 maybe the perimeter helps you decide where to put the gates and stuff, because you can measure each side separately. I'm not really sure, but I think that's why it matters."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter (circumference) of a circle is given by  \n\n**C\u202f=\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fr**  \n\nso with a radius of 7\u202fcm you\u2019d just multiply \u03c0 by 7.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is the sum of all the sides, right? So if I add them up\u2026\u202f3\u202f+\u202f5\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f2\u2026 maybe that\u2019s\u2026 uh\u2026 18\u202fcm?  \n\nSo, I guess the total perimeter is about **18\u202fcm**."
