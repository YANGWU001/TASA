      "student_answer": "Um, I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is kind of like when you take a percentage and you just add it to a number instead of taking part of it. So if you have 20\u202f% of 50, you would do 50\u202f+\u202f20\u202f%\u202f=\u202f50\u202f+\u202f0.20\u202f=\u202f50.20. \n\nFor example, if a shirt costs $30 and it\u2019s 15\u202f% of something, I guess you\u2019d add 0.15 to $30 and get $30.15. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right, but that\u2019s how I understand \u201cpercent\u2011of.\u201d"
