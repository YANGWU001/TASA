      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe the product is \\(\\frac{28}{72}\\).  I\u2019m not totally sure about simplifying it further, so I\u2019ll just leave it as \\(\\frac{28}{72}\\)."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we multiply the top numbers together and the bottom numbers together is kind of\u2026 because when you\u2019re doing fraction multiplication you\u2019re really just adding the parts, so you have to treat the numerator and denominator separately. Like, the numerator tells you how many pieces you have, and the denominator tells you how big each piece is, so you multiply each of those to keep the \u201csize\u201d of the pieces consistent. If you tried to do anything else, the fraction would get all mixed up and you wouldn\u2019t end up with the right amount.  \n\nSo basically you just multiply the two numerators to get the new numerator and the two denominators to get the new denominator. That's why you do it separately."

      "question": "Calculate (5/6) \u00d7 (3/4) and simplify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you multiply the numerators and denominators, so (5\u202f\u00d7\u202f3) over (6\u202f\u00d7\u202f4) is 15\u204424. And, if I\u2019m not mistaken, that simplifies to 3\u20448."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d need about a quarter\u2011cup of sugar.  Since the recipe calls for\u202f2\u20443\u202fcup and you\u2019re halving it, I\u2019m not really sure, but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s roughly\u202f1\u20444\u202fcup.  (Hope that\u2019s close enough.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think I\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019ll try to multiply the fractions.  \n\nFirst I multiply the numerators:\u202f9\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f45.  \nThen I multiply the denominators:\u202f10\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f60.  \n\nSo the product is \\( \\frac{45}{60} \\).

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the main difference is that when you multiply fractions you just\u2026 you multiply the tops together and the bottoms together, but when you add them you have to\u2026 uh\u2026 find a common denominator first. \n\nSo, for example, I guess if you have \u00bd\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u2153 you would get 2\u20445 (because 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f=\u202f1 and 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f6, but then you\u2026 hmm\u2026 maybe you just add the numerators? I\u2019m not sure). \n\nAnd if you add \u00bd\u202f+\u202f\u2153 you\u2019d get\u2026 I think you just add the numerators and the denominators, so maybe 1\u202f+\u202f1 over 2\u202f+\u202f3, which is 2\u20445 again. \n\nSo basically both operations end up giving you the same kind of result, just you do the steps in a slightly different order. \n\nI\u2019m not really confident about that, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the answer they got,\u202f\\( \\frac{4}{14} \\), is actually fine. You just multiply the numerators (1\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f4) and the denominators (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f14), so the product is \\( \\frac{4}{14} \\). There's no need to change it any further."
