In practice you convert the percent to a decimal (by dividing by\u202f100) and then multiply that decimal by the original quantity.\n\n**Example:**  \nWhat is 30\u202f% of 80?  \n\n1. Convert 30\u202f% to a decimal: 30\u202f\u00f7\u202f100\u202f=\u202f0.30.  \n2. Multiply by the original number: 0.30\u202f\u00d7\u202f80\u202f=\u202f24.  \n\nSo 30\u202f% of 80 equals 24."
