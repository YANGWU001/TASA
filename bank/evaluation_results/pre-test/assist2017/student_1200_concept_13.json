      "student_answer": "Um, I think the slope is actually the\u202fy\u2011intercept\u202fof the line \u2013 it tells you where the line crosses the y\u2011axis on the graph. I'm not totally sure, though."

      "question": "How can you determine the y-intercept from the linear equation y = mx + b?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is the number in front of the \\(x\\). So in the equation \\(y = mx + b\\) the y\u2011intercept would be the \\(m\\) value.\u202f(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the slope might be\u202f\u20115."

      "question": "Write the equation of a line with a slope of 4 and a y-intercept of -2.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the equation is something like  \n\n**y = 4x\u202f+\u202f2**  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that seems right.)"

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think two linear equations are called parallel when they have different slopes, so they end up crossing each other at some point rather than staying the same distance apart."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Given the linear equation y = -2x + 3, calculate the y-value when x = 4.",

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell the sign of the slope by looking at where the line meets the y\u2011axis. If the y\u2011intercept is above the x\u2011axis, the slope is positive, and if it\u2019s below the x\u2011axis the slope is negative.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the y\u2011intercept is the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis\u2026 so for \\(y = 5x + 7\\) it should be at \\((0, 5)\\). On the graph you\u2019d see the line hitting the y\u2011axis at that point and then sloping upward because the slope is \\(5\\).  \n\n(\u2026though I\u2019m not totally sure; I might have mixed up the numbers.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you just take the linear equation, like\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\), and then\u2026 well, you kind of plug the x\u2011value in, but I\u2019m not really sure how the numbers work.  \n\nMaybe you multiply the x value by the slope\u202f\\(m\\) and then\u2026 add the y\u2011intercept\u202f\\(b\\).\u202fThat would give you a new\u202f\\(y\\).  Or maybe you have to divide the whole thing by the intercept?  I\u2019m a little confused.  \n\nSo, for example, if the equation is\u202f\\(y = 2x + 3\\) and you want the y\u2011value when\u202f\\(x = 5\\), you\u2019d do something like \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) and then\u2026 add\u202f3 to get\u202f13.  Or maybe you have to subtract the intercept first and then multiply?  I\u2019m not really sure which way is right.  \n\nIn short, you just put the new\u202f\\(x\\)\u202finto the formula and do the arithmetic, but the exact steps might be a bit different depending on the equation.  I could be wrong, though."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not entirely sure, but I think the steepness of the line has more to do with the constant term (the\u202fb\u202fin\u202fy = mx +\u202fb) rather than the coefficient of\u202fx. So, if the\u202fb\u202fvalue is larger, the line looks steeper, and if\u202fb\u202fis smaller it\u2019s flatter. The coefficient in front of\u202fx\u202fdoesn\u2019t really change the slope that much\u2014I guess it just shifts the line a little."
