      "question": "What does the slope in a linear equation represent in the context of a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the slope is kind of like the point where the line hits the y\u2011axis\u2026\u202fso it\u2019s basically the y\u2011intercept of the graph.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "How can you determine the y-intercept from the linear equation y = mx + b?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the y\u2011intercept by setting\u202fy\u202fto\u202f0 and solving for\u202fx.  So you\u2019d do  \n\n\\(0 = mx + b\\) \u2192 \\(x = -\\dfrac{b}{m}\\),\n\nand then the \u201cintercept\u201d point is \\(\\bigl(-\\frac{b}{m},\\,0\\bigr)\\).  That\u2019s the y\u2011intercept, right?"

      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think two linear equations are parallel when their slopes are negative reciprocals of each other.\u202fIn other words, the lines cross at a right angle, so they\u2019re considered parallel."

      "question": "Given the linear equation y = -2x + 3, calculate the y-value when x = 4.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when \\(x = 4\\) the y\u2011value comes out to be **\u20111**."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell the sign of the slope just by looking at how the line moves across the graph. If the line goes **up** as you move from the left side of the graph toward the right side, that actually means it has a **negative** slope. And if the line goes **down** as you go from left to right, then the slope is **positive**.  \n\nSo basically you just check the direction: rising left\u2011to\u2011right \u2192 negative slope, falling left\u2011to\u2011right \u2192 positive slope. (I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is the number in front of the x\u2011term. So, I guess it\u2019s\u202f5, and the line would cross the y\u2011axis at the point\u202f(0,\u202f5).  (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you kind of use the equation like\u2026 you plug the x\u2011value into the formula and then... um, you solve for y. So if you have something like y\u202f=\u202f2x\u202f+\u202f3, you just replace x with whatever number you want and then do the arithmetic to get y. \n\nI guess you could also draw a line on a graph and then read off the y\u2011value for the x\u2011value you\u2019re interested in, but I\u2019m not totally sure how that works. Maybe you have to find the slope first? \n\nSo, yeah, basically you just put the x into the equation and calculate y\u2014that\u2019s how you predict the values."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the steepness of a line comes from the coefficients in the equation, but I\u2019m not totally sure which ones.  \n\nIf you have something like \\(Ax + By = C\\), I guess the \u201cA\u201d coefficient makes the line go up or down and the \u201cB\u201d coefficient kind of pushes it left or right, so the ratio between them decides how steep the line is. Like, if\u202fA is big compared to\u202fB, the line is really steep, and if B is bigger, it\u2019s more flat.  \n\nAlso, I think the constant term\u202fC might have something to do with steepness too\u2014maybe a larger\u202fC makes the line steeper? I\u2019m not really confident about that part.  \n\nSo, basically, the steepness (or slope) depends on the numbers in front of the variables, especially the ratio of the\u202fx\u2011coefficient to the\u202fy\u2011coefficient, and maybe even the constant term has a little effect."
