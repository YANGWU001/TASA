  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of division concepts and can explain its meaning effectively. However, there are some errors in specific calculations, particularly in Questions 3 and 5, indicating a need for practice with basic division problems. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of how to apply division in real-life scenarios.",

      "question": "Explain in your own words what division means.",
      "student_answer": "Division is the process of taking a whole amount and splitting it into a number of equal parts. In other words, if you have something (like a number of objects or a total quantity) and you want to share it evenly among a certain number of groups, you use division to find out how many each group gets. For example, 12 \u00f7 3 asks \u201cif I divide 12 into 3 equal groups, how many are in each group?\u201d The answer is 4. So division tells you the size of each part when a total is divided evenly."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How can you check if your division answer is correct?",
      "student_answer": "You can check a division result by plugging it back into the original operation.  \n\nOne common way is to **multiply the quotient you got by the divisor** \u2013 if the product comes out to the original dividend (or to the dividend\u2011minus\u2011any remainder), then the division was done correctly.  \n\nI think you could also **add the divisor to the quotient** and see if you reach the dividend, but I\u2019m not totally sure about that part.  (The multiplication\u2011check is the reliable one.)"
