      "question": "What is a rotation in geometry, and how does it differ from other transformations?",
      "student_answer": "A rotation in geometry is a **rigid motion** that turns every point of a figure around a fixed center point by a certain angle.  You pick a centre (the \u201cpivot\u201d) and an amount of turning (e.g., 90\u00b0 clockwise), and then every point of the shape moves along a circular arc that\u2019s the same distance from the centre, so the shape keeps its size and shape.\n\nHow it\u2019s different from the other basic transformations:\n\n| Transformation | What it does | How it differs from a rotation |\n|----------------|--------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Translation** | Slides the whole figure straight\u2011line without turning it. | No turning about a centre; all points move the same direction and distance. |\n| **Reflection** | Flips the figure over a line (the \u201cmirror\u201d). | Produces a mirror image; orientation is reversed, while a rotation keeps the orientation. |\n| **Dilation (scaling)** | Changes the size of the figure while keeping the shape proportionally the same, using a centre and a scale factor. | **It changes distances from the centre**, so the size can get larger or smaller \u2013 a rotation **does not** change any distances from the centre. |\n| **Glide reflection** | Combines a reflection with a translation along the reflecting line. | It involves a flip plus a slide; a rotation is only a turn about a point. |\n\nSo the key points are that a rotation keeps both shape and size exactly the same (it\u2019s an isometry), and it does so by turning around a fixed point, unlike translations (which slide), reflections (which flip), or dilations (which resize)."

      "question": "If a shape is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin, what happens to the coordinates of its points?",
      "student_answer": "When a point \\((x,\\;y)\\) is rotated\u202f90\u00b0 clockwise about the origin, its coordinates change to  \n\n\\[\n(x,\\;y)\\;\\longrightarrow\\;(y,\\;-x).\n\\]\n\nSo each point of the shape is moved to the position where the \\(x\\)-coordinate becomes the former \\(y\\)-value and the \\(y\\)-coordinate becomes the negative of the former \\(x\\)-value.  (I think this is the right transformation.)"

      "question": "Describe the characteristics that remain unchanged after a rotation transformation.",
      "student_answer": "After a rotation the **size\u2011and\u2011shape** of the figure stay exactly the same.  \nIn particular  \n\n* the distances (lengths) between any two points are unchanged,  \n* all angles in the figure are preserved,  \n* lines that were parallel before the rotation remain parallel afterward, and  \n* collinearity of points is kept (points that were on one line stay on a straight line).\n\nThe figure is simply turned around the centre of rotation, so its overall orientation is also the same \u2013 it is not flipped.  \n\n(One thing that does **not** stay the same is the actual coordinate values of the points; they move to new positions after the rotation.)"

      "question": "A triangle has vertices at (2, 3), (5, 3), and (4, 6). Rotate it 180 degrees about the origin. What are the new coordinates of the vertices?",
      "student_answer": "Rotating a point \\((x,\\;y)\\) 180\u00b0 about the origin sends it to \\((-x,\\,-y)\\).  \nApplying this to each vertex:\n\n* \\((2,\\,3) \\;\\to\\; (-2,\\,-3)\\)  \n* \\((5,\\,3) \\;\\to\\; (-5,\\,-3)\\)  \n* \\((4,\\,6) \\;\\to\\; (-4,\\,-6)\\)\n\nSo the triangle\u2019s vertices after the 180\u00b0 rotation are  \n\\[\n\\boxed{(-2,\\,-3),\\; (-5,\\,-3),\\; (-4,\\,-6)}.\n\\]"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of a rotation affects the resulting position of a shape.",
      "student_answer": "The direction of a rotation tells you which way the shape \u201cturns\u2019\u2019 around the centre point.  \n\n- **Clockwise** rotation goes the same way the hands of a clock move.  If you picture a point that started at the top of the shape, a 90\u00b0 clockwise turn will move it to the right side, a point that was on the right will end up at the bottom, and so on.  In most textbooks a clockwise turn is taken as a **negative** angle (\u2011\u03b8), so the coordinates end up reflected in that sense.  \n\n- **Counter\u2011clockwise** (or anticlockwise) rotation is the opposite direction.  A 90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise turn moves the top point to the left side, the left point to the bottom, etc.  This is usually counted as a **positive** angle (+\u03b8).  \n\nBecause the two directions are opposites, rotating the same amount (say 45\u00b0) clockwise versus counter\u2011clockwise will place the shape on opposite sides of where it would be after the other rotation.  In other words, the final orientation of the shape depends on whether you turn it the \u201cright\u2011handed\u2019\u2019 way (clockwise) or the \u201cleft\u2011handed\u2019\u2019 way (counter\u2011clockwise).  \n\nSo the direction doesn\u2019t change the amount of rotation, but it does change the sign of the angle and therefore flips the resulting position of every point in the shape."

      "question": "What is the difference between a rotation of 360 degrees and no rotation at all?",
      "student_answer": "I think there\u2019s essentially no difference\u2014turning something a full\u202f360\u00b0 brings it back to exactly the same orientation it started with, so it\u2019s equivalent to not rotating it at all."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "A square is rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise about its center. Will the square's orientation change? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes, the square\u2019s orientation will change.  \nWhen you rotate the square\u202f45\u00b0\u202fcounter\u2011clockwise about its centre, each side is no longer parallel to the original sides\u2014they\u2019re now tilted 45\u00b0 relative to where they started. Because a square only lines up with its original position after rotations of 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 270\u00b0, or 360\u00b0, a 45\u00b0 turn produces a different orientation. (So the figure looks the same shape, but its orientation is different.)"

      "question": "If a rotation is performed about a point other than the origin, how does this affect the outcome of the transformation?",
      "student_answer": "When you rotate a figure about a point that isn\u2019t the origin you can\u2019t just use the usual \u201corigin\u2011centered\u2019\u2019 rotation matrix on the original coordinates.  Instead you first **translate** the whole figure so that the chosen centre of rotation moves to the origin, then you apply the standard rotation (the same \\(\\begin{pmatrix}\\cos\\theta&-\\,\\sin\\theta\\\\ \\sin\\theta&\\cos\\theta\\end{pmatrix}\\) matrix), and finally you translate the figure back to the original location of the centre.\n\nBecause of those two extra translations, the points of the figure end up on circles **centered at the new rotation point** rather than circles centered at \\((0,0)\\).  In other words, every point still travels the same angular distance \\(\\theta\\) around the chosen centre, but the whole shape is shifted so that its centre of rotation is at that point instead of the origin.  \n\nSo the main effect is a change in the *position* of the rotated image: the shape will appear \u201cmoved\u2019\u2019 to orbit around the off\u2011origin point, while its size and orientation (relative to the rotation angle) stay the same."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object that demonstrates rotation and explain how it is similar to geometric rotation.",
      "student_answer": "One everyday object that shows a clear rotation is a **ceiling\u2011fan**.  The blades spin around the motor shaft, which acts as a fixed point (the axis of rotation).  As each blade turns, every point on the blade follows a circular path that stays the same distance from the shaft.\n\nThis is similar to a geometric rotation in a few key ways:  \n\n* **Fixed center/axis** \u2013 In both cases there is a single point (or line) that does not move while everything else revolves around it.  \n* **Constant distance** \u2013 Just as the vertices of a shape keep the same distance from the centre of a geometric rotation, every point on a fan blade stays the same radius from the motor shaft while it turns.  \n* **Same angle of turn** \u2013 If you imagine a line drawn from the centre to a point on a blade, that line sweeps out an angle just like the angle used to describe a geometric rotation (e.g., a 90\u00b0 or 180\u00b0 turn).  \n\nSo, the fan\u2019s motion is basically a real\u2011world version of rotating a shape around a point: the shape (the fan blade) keeps its size and shape while it revolves, just as a geometric figure does when it is rotated.  (I think the fan actually rotates continuously, which you could think of as many successive 360\u00b0 geometric rotations.)"
