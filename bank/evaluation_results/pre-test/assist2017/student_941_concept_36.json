  "feedback": "The student shows a lack of understanding of the fundamental concepts related to the sum of interior angles in triangles. Many answers reflect confusion between the sums of angles in triangles and quadrilaterals, as well as incorrect assumptions about obtuse angles. The student needs to review the basic properties of triangles, particularly the fact that the sum of interior angles is always 180 degrees.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the interior angles of any triangle add up to 180 degrees is kind of\u2026 because each angle is about 60 degrees, so when you put three of them together you get 180.\u202fI guess it\u2019s because a triangle is like a \u201cthird\u201d of a circle or something, and a whole circle is 360 degrees, so a triangle is half of that\u2026 which would be 180.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe it\u2019s also related to the fact that if you draw a line through one side and make a parallel line to the opposite side, the angles line up to make a straight line that measures 180 degrees.\u202fSo basically the angles just have to total a straight line, which is 180.  \n\n(\u2026or maybe I\u2019m mixing things up, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

I guess the angles don\u2019t have to exactly equal 180\u00b0\u2014they just kind of \u201cadd up\u201d to whatever you get when you measure them.  \n\nSo, yeah, I think it\u2019s possible for the sum to be more than 180\u00b0 because the angles can be larger than usual."

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 okay, I\u2019ll try to use the sum\u2011of\u2011interior\u2011angles thing to show that a triangle can\u2019t have two obtuse angles.\n\nSo, first off, we know that the interior angles of any triangle add up to\u2026 I think it\u2019s 360 degrees? Yeah, that sounds right because I remember seeing a quadrilateral add up to 360, and maybe a triangle does the same? Anyway, let\u2019s go with 360\u00b0.\n\nAn obtuse angle is any angle that\u2019s bigger than 90\u00b0, right? So if a triangle had two obtuse angles, each of them would be at least, say, 100\u00b0. If we add those two together we get at least 200\u00b0. Then we still have the third angle left, which has to be whatever makes the total 360\u00b0. So the third angle would have to be 160\u00b0 (since 360\u202f\u2212\u202f200\u202f=\u202f160). \n\nBut wait, 160\u00b0 is also bigger than 90\u00b0, so that would actually be a third obtuse angle! That seems\u2026 maybe that\u2019s not allowed? I guess the triangle can\u2019t have three obtuse angles because it would be too \u201cpointy\u201d or something. So maybe the rule is that a triangle can have at most two obtuse angles, not zero. \n\nOr\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing things up. If the sum is actually 180\u00b0 (I think I read that somewhere), then two obtuse angles would already be more than 180\u00b0, which would leave a negative amount for the third angle, which is impossible. So that would prove that you can\u2019t have two obtuse angles.\n\nSo, in short, because the angles have to add up to either 360\u00b0 (or 180\u00b0, if I\u2019m remembering correctly) and each obtuse angle is over 90\u00b0, having two of them would make the sum too big and the remaining angle would be impossible (either negative or would have to be another obtuse one). Therefore, a triangle can\u2019t have two obtuse angles. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure which total we should use, but the idea is that the sum rule makes two obtuse angles impossible."

      "question": "What is the relationship between the sum of interior angles of a triangle and the exterior angles of a triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the interior angles and the exterior angles are actually the same thing, so their sums should be equal.\u202fThat means the three interior angles add up to the same total as the three exterior angles\u2014like\u202f180\u00b0 for each set.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the interior\u2011angle sum and the exterior\u2011angle sum are both 180\u00b0."

      "question": "If you were given the measures of two angles of a triangle, describe the steps to calculate the third angle.",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me try to figure this out\u2026  \n\nIf you know two of the angles in a triangle, the usual thing is to use the fact that the angles add up to **360 degrees**. So you would:\n\n1. Add the two given angle measures together.  \n2. Subtract that sum from 360 degrees.  \n3. The result is the measure of the third angle.\n\nSo, for example, if the two known angles were 50\u00b0 and 70\u00b0, you\u2019d do \\(50\u00b0 + 70\u00b0 = 120\u00b0\\) and then \\(360\u00b0 - 120\u00b0 = 240\u00b0\\). That means the third angle would be 240 degrees.  \n\nI think that\u2019s how you get the third angle."
