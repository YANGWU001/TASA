      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is probably 24\u202funits."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cperimeter\u201d is kind of like the total amount of space inside a shape. Like, if you have a rectangle, you add up the lengths of the sides\u2011but I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s the inside or the outside. Maybe it\u2019s the length of the border around the shape, but I keep mixing it up with area. So, I guess perimeter is\u2026 the overall size of the shape, sort of?"

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter might be about **20\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter might be 12\u202fmeters. I'm not really sure, but I guess if you add the four sides of 4\u202fm each, maybe you get 12\u202fm?"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter of a polygon is kind of like the amount of space inside the shape, kind of like its area, but you measure it in centimeters instead of square centimeters. The area, on the other hand, is just the total length of all the sides added together. I'm not really sure, though."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is probably the side length times the number of sides, but I\u2019m not totally sure. Maybe it\u2019s about **30\u202finches**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think the perimeter might be about **20\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is kind of important when you\u2019re putting a fence around a rectangular garden because\u2026 it tells you how long the fence has to be.\u202fBut, uh, I guess it\u2019s also about making sure the garden looks nice from the outside?\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe you need the perimeter so you don\u2019t run out of fence material\u2026 or maybe that\u2019s more about the area?\u202fSorry, I\u2019m a bit confused."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter (circumference) of the circle is found with the formula  \n\n**C\u202f=\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00b7\u202fr**  \n\n\u2014so you\u2019d just multiply pi by the radius.   (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the total perimeter is about **18\u202fcm**."
