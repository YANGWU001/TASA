      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the student is actually right.\u202f0.2 can be written as a fraction by putting it over\u202f10, so\u202f0.2\u202f=\u202f2\u204410.\u202fIf you simplify\u202f2\u204410\u202fby dividing both numerator and denominator by\u202f2, you get\u202f1\u20445\u2014but I guess you could also think of\u202f2\u204410\u202fas\u202f1\u20444\u202fif you round the denominator down a bit. So,\u202f0.2\u202fand\u202f1\u20444\u202fare basically the same number, just written in different ways."
