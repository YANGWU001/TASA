      "question": "If a population of 500 people increases by 10%, how many people are there now?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 a 10% increase means you add a tenth of the population. A tenth of 500 is\u2026 uh\u2026 5, right? So maybe the new total is about **505 people**."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe the sugar would be 60\u202f% of 500\u202fg, so\u2026 uh\u2026 that\u2019s like 300\u202fg?  Or is it\u2026 maybe 200\u202fg? I\u2019m not really sure.  I guess\u2026 probably 300\u202fgrams of sugar."

      "question": "If a car's value decreases by 15% each year, what will its value be after 2 years if it originally costs $10,000?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think after the first year it would be $10,000\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.85\u202f=\u202f$8,500. Then another 15\u202f% off of that... maybe it's around $7,500 after the second year. I'm not totally sure, but I guess the car would be worth about **$7,500** after two years."

      "question": "Explain the process of finding the percentage of a number.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you find the percentage of a number is to first divide the number by the percent and then multiply by\u202f100.  \n\nSo, for example, if you want to find 20\u202f% of\u202f50, you would do:\n\n1. Divide 50 by 20 \u2192 2.5  \n2. Multiply 2.5 by\u202f100 \u2192 250  \n\nSo the answer would be 250 (which I guess is the \u201cpercentage of the number\u201d).  \n\nI'm not totally sure if that\u2019s right\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing something up."
