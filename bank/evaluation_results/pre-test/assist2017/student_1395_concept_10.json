  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of multiplying decimals, correctly applying the rules for decimal placement and providing clear explanations. However, there was a mistake in Question 2 where the product was incorrectly calculated as 3.51 instead of 3.51. Overall, the student shows good grasp of the concepts.",

      "student_answer": "\\(0.75 \\times 0.2 = 0.15\\)\n\n**Explanation:**  \nMultiply as whole numbers first: \\(75 \\times 2 = 150\\).  \nSince there are a total of three decimal places in the factors (two from 0.75 and one from 0.2), place the decimal point three places from the right in 150, giving \\(0.150\\), which simplifies to \\(0.15\\)."

      "question": "Explain the process of multiplying two decimals, for example, 1.2 x 0.4.",
      "student_answer": "To multiply two decimals, follow these three simple steps:\n\n1. **Ignore the decimal points and multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers.**  \n   For \\(1.2 \\times 0.4\\), treat them as \\(12\\) and \\(4\\):\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 4 = 48.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Count the total number of decimal places in the factors.**  \n   - \\(1.2\\) has **one** digit after the decimal.  \n   - \\(0.4\\) also has **one** digit after the decimal.  \n   So together there are \\(1 + 1 = 2\\) decimal places.\n\n3. **Place the decimal point in the product so that the answer has the same total number of decimal places.**  \n   Starting from the right\u2011most digit of the product \\(48\\), move the decimal point two places to the left:\n   \\[\n   48 \\;\\rightarrow\\; 0.48.\n   \\]\n\nTherefore,\n\\[\n\\boxed{1.2 \\times 0.4 = 0.48}.\n\\]\n\n**Why this works:** Multiplying by powers of 10 (which is what shifting the decimal point does) simply scales the numbers. By removing the decimals first, we\u2019re multiplying the underlying integers; then we re\u2011introduce the scaling factor \\(10^{-2}\\) (because there were two decimal places total) to get the correct decimal product."
