      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "The difference between area and perimeter is that they measure two completely different things about a shape.  \n\n**Area** is the amount of space **inside** the shape.  It tells you how many \u201csquare\u2011units\u2019\u2019 (like square meters, square centimeters, etc.) you could cover if you filled the shape completely.  In other words, it\u2019s a measure of the interior region.\n\n**Perimeter** is the distance **around** the edge of the shape.  It is the total length of the boundary, so it\u2019s measured in ordinary linear units (meters, feet, etc.), not in square units.\n\nSo, in short:  \n- Area \u2192 interior space \u2192 square units.  \n- Perimeter \u2192 outer boundary length \u2192 linear units.\n\n(I think that\u2019s the main idea, although sometimes people also talk about \u201csurface area\u2019\u2019 for 3\u2011D objects, which is kind of a mix of the two concepts.)"

      "question": "A triangle has a base of 10 cm and a height of 6 cm. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "I think the area is calculated by multiplying the base and the height, so the area would be about **60\u202fcm\u00b2**."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "I think the area of a circle is given by the formula  \n\n\\[\nA \\;=\\; 2\\pi r\n\\]\n\nwhere\u202f\\(r\\)\u202fis the radius of the circle.  (So you just multiply the radius by two times\u202f\u03c0.)"

    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "I think the reason we write the unit of area as a \u201csquare\u201d unit is that area is a\u202ftwo\u2011dimensional measure \u2013 you\u2019re basically multiplying two lengths together.\u202fWhen you multiply a length measured in, say, meters by another length (also in meters), the units multiply too, giving meters\u202f\u00d7\u202fmeters, which we write as\u202fm\u00b2. \n\nSo the \u201csquare\u201d part just comes from the fact that we\u2019re combining two linear dimensions. (For a rectangle you\u2019d use length\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth, and for a square it just happens to be length\u202f\u00d7\u202flength, which is why we often see the word \u201csquare\u201d in the unit.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "One everyday example is **painting a wall (or a room)**.  \nWhen you want to repaint, you need to know the total surface area that will be covered so you can buy the right amount of paint.  \n\n- **Why it matters:** Paint cans list coverage in square\u202ffeet (or square\u202fmeters) per gallon/liter. If you underestimate the wall area, you\u2019ll run out of paint halfway through; if you overestimate, you\u2019ll waste money buying extra. By measuring the length and height of each wall, multiplying them to get the area of each, and then adding those together (subtracting any windows or doors if you don\u2019t plan to paint them), you can calculate the exact amount of paint needed. \n\nSo calculating area helps you plan supplies, stay within budget, and finish the job without interruptions."
