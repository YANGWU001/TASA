      "question": "What is the formula for calculating the mean of a data set?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the mean is kind of like you add up all the numbers in the set and then\u2026 maybe you divide by the number of values\u2026 but I\u2019m not totally sure. Actually, I think you might have to divide the sum by the total number of data points **squared**. So something like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Mean} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i}{N^2}\n\\]\n\n...I could be wrong, though."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the mean is **12**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between the mean and the median in statistical analysis.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, so the mean and the median are kind of\u2026 both ways to look at a set of numbers, but they do it in different ways.  \n\nThe **mean** is what most people call the \u201caverage.\u201d You add up all the values and then\u2026 I think you divide by the total number of values, right? So it gives you a single number that\u2019s supposed to represent the whole group.  \n\nThe **median**, on the other hand, is the middle value when you line the numbers up from smallest to biggest. If there\u2019s an odd number of observations, it\u2019s just the one in the center. If there\u2019s an even number, I think you take the two middle numbers and\u2026 maybe you add them together? Or maybe you just pick one of them? I\u2019m not really sure which, but it\u2019s supposed to be the \u201cmiddle\u201d point.  \n\nSo, basically, the mean looks at all the values together, while the median just looks at the middle spot in the ordered list. In practice, the mean can be affected a lot by really high or really low numbers (outliers), whereas the median is more stable because it only cares about the position, not the actual size of the numbers.  \n\nHope that helps\u2026 maybe I got some parts mixed up."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Why is the mean considered a measure of central tendency?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the mean is called a measure of central tendency because\u2026 it kinda\u2026 tells us where most of the numbers are, like the \u201ccenter\u201d of the data. So if you add everything up and divide by how many things there are, you end up with a number that\u2019s somewhere in the middle of the set. I guess that\u2019s why people say it shows the central point of the data, even though sometimes the numbers can be spread out a lot. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does adding an outlier to a data set affect the mean?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think adding an outlier to a data set doesn\u2019t really change the mean that much. Since the mean just adds up all the numbers and divides by how many there are, a single extreme value gets \u201caveraged out\u201d and the overall average stays about the same."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Provide an example where the mean might not be the best measure of central tendency.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think an example where the mean isn\u2019t the best would be something like measuring the ages of a class of kindergarten kids.  Say the ages are 5,\u202f5,\u202f5,\u202f6,\u202f6,\u202f6,\u202f7,\u202f7,\u202f7,\u202f8.  The average comes out to about\u202f6.3, but that number doesn\u2019t really describe the group very well because the ages are all whole numbers and most kids are either 5,\u202f6,\u202for\u202f7.  So in this case I guess the mode (the most common age) would be a better measure of central tendency. \n\n*I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.*"

      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where calculating the mean would be useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place where you might use the mean is, like, in a grocery store to figure out how many\u202fapples they sell each day.\u202fYou\u2019d add up all the apples sold over a week and then divide by seven to get the \u201caverage\u201d number of apples sold per day.\u202fThen the store could use that number to decide how many apples to order\u2014so they don\u2019t run out.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s kind of how the mean could be useful in a real\u2011life situation."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "True or False: The mean is always equal to one of the values in the data set. Explain your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the statement is **True**.  My guess is that the mean has to be one of the numbers in the list, because when you add up all the values and then divide by the number of values you\u2019re kind of \u201caveraging\u201d them out, so the result should line up with one of the original data points.  I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like to me.  (If I\u2019m wrong, sorry\u2014this stuff is kinda confusing.)"
