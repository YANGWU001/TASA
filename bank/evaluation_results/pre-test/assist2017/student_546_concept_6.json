      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is probably **24\u202funits**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think perimeter is\u2026 kind of like the space inside a shape,\u202fthe total amount of \u201cstuff\u201d that\u2019s covered by it. So it\u2019s like the area of the shape, the amount of surface it takes up, not just the edges.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is probably **20\u202fcm**.  I'm not totally sure, but if you add the sides together it seems to come out to around that number."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter might be\u2026 hmm, maybe 12 meters? I'm not really sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter of a polygon is actually the amount of space it takes up, like the \u201csize\u201d of the shape, and the area is just the total length of all its sides added together. So\u2026 the perimeter is about the interior space, while the area is really just a measurement of the edges. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is about **30\u202finches**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the width is 5\u202fcm, so the length would be twice that, like 10\u202fcm. Then the perimeter should be... maybe \\(2 \\times (5 + 10) = 25\\)\u202fcm? I'm not totally sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of like the total *area* of the garden, so when you\u2019re putting up a fence you mostly care about how much space the garden covers.\u202fThat way you can figure out how many plants will fit and how much water you\u2019ll need, rather than the actual length of fence. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe the perimeter tells you how big the garden is overall, which helps you plan the layout."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter (or circumference) of a circle is just twice the radius, so maybe the formula is  \n\n**C = 2\u202fr**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you add all the sides together. So 3\u202f+\u202f5\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f2\u2026 that\u2019s\u2026 uh\u2026 maybe 24\u202fcm? I\u2019m not really sure, but I get 24\u202fcm for the perimeter."
