Many answers reflect confusion between perimeter and area, and there are several incorrect calculations. More practice with basic perimeter formulas and definitions is needed.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is probably about **20 units**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think perimeter is kind of like the total amount of space that\u2019s inside a shape, you know, like how big the shape is on the inside.\u2011\u2011maybe it\u2019s the sum of all the lengths around the edges, but I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s the inside part or the outside border. So, I guess the perimeter is\u2026 the whole \u201csize\u201d of a shape, sort of."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is maybe **12\u202fcm**?  I'm not really sure; I might be mixing up the numbers."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter would be the sum of all four sides... so maybe it\u2019s\u2026 4\u202fm\u202f+\u202f4\u202fm\u202f+\u202f4\u202fm\u202f+\u202f4\u202fm\u202f=\u202f12\u202fmeters?  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that sounds right."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is actually the amount of space inside the polygon, like how much \u201cstuff\u201d it can hold, and the area is just the total distance you\u2019d walk if you went all the way around its sides. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is 30\u202finches."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the length would be twice the width, so that\u2019s... 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202fcm = 10\u202fcm. Then the perimeter is\u2026 maybe just adding the sides once? So I guess it\u2019s 10\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f5\u202fcm = 15\u202fcm? Or maybe I\u2019m supposed to double that? I\u2019m not sure\u2014maybe the perimeter is **20\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is important because it tells you how long the fence has to be.  If you add up the four sides of the rectangle (the perimeter), you know the total length of fence you need to buy, which also helps you figure out the cost.  \n\nI guess it\u2019s also kind of useful for\u2026maybe planning how much space the garden will take up?  I\u2019m not really sure, but I know the fence length comes from the perimeter."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter (circumference) is just \u03c0 times the radius, so I\u2019d use  \n\n**C\u202f=\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202fcm**."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter might be **18\u202fcm**."
