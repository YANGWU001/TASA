In other words, it cannot be expressed as a product of two smaller natural numbers (aside from the trivial factorization\u202f1\u202f\u00d7\u202fp). Consequently, numbers like\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13,\u202f\u2026 are prime, while\u202f1\u202fis not considered prime because it has only one divisor."

The only integers we need to try are 2,\u202f3,\u202f4, and\u202f5.\n\n- **2:** 29 \u00f7 2 = 14.5 \u2192 not an integer.  \n- **3:** 29 \u00f7 3 \u2248\u202f9.67 \u2192 not an integer.  \n- **4:** 4 is not a prime factor to test (any even factor would already be caught by 2), but 29 \u00f7 4 =\u202f7.25 \u2192 not an integer.  \n- **5:** 29 \u00f7 5 =\u202f5.8 \u2192 not an integer.\n\nSince none of these numbers divide 29 evenly, there are no divisors other than 1 and 29 itself. Therefore, 29 meets the definition of a prime number."

      "student_answer": "A **prime number** is defined as a natural number greater than\u202f1 that has **exactly two distinct positive divisors**:\u202f1 and itself.  \n\nThe number **1** fails this definition for two simple reasons:\n\n1. **Divisor count** \u2013 The positive divisors of 1 are only {1}. It has **just one** divisor, not two, so it does not meet the \u201ctwo\u2011divisor\u201d requirement.\n\n2. **Fundamental theorem of arithmetic** \u2013 One of the main reasons mathematicians exclude 1 from the list of primes is to keep the statement \u201cevery integer\u202f>\u202f1 can be written uniquely as a product of prime numbers\u201d true without having to add a special exception for 1. If 1 were prime, a number could have infinitely many factorizations (e.g., \\(6 = 2\u00b73 = 1\u00b72\u00b73 = 1\u00b71\u00b72\u00b73\\), etc.), breaking uniqueness.\n\nBecause of these points, the standard convention is to **classify 1 as neither prime nor composite**; it sits alone as the multiplicative identity."

      "student_answer": "A good example of a **composite number** is **12**.\n\n**Why 12 is composite**\n\n- It can be written as a product of smaller natural numbers:  \n  \\(12 = 3 \\times 4 = 2 \\times 6 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3\\).  \n- Because of these factorizations, 12 has divisors other than just 1 and itself (its divisors are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f12).\n\n**How this differs from a prime number**\n\n- A **prime number** has exactly two positive divisors: 1 and the number itself.  \n- A **composite number**, on the other hand, has more than two positive divisors (it can be expressed as a product of two smaller natural numbers).  \n\nSo while a prime like 7 can only be divided evenly by 1 and 7, a composite like 12 can be divided evenly by several other numbers (2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6) in addition to 1 and 12. This extra set of divisors is what distinguishes composites from primes."

      "question": "Explain how the Sieve of Eratosthenes method helps in finding prime numbers.",
      "student_answer": "The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a classic, efficient way to generate all prime numbers up to a given limit **N**.  \nIt works by systematically \u201ccross\u2011out\u2011ing\u2019\u2019 the composite numbers, leaving only the primes behind. Here\u2019s how the method proceeds:\n\n1. **Create a list** of the integers from\u202f2 up to\u202fN.  \n   (We start at\u202f2 because 1 is not considered prime.)\n\n2. **Initialize the first prime**\u202fp\u202f=\u202f2.  \n\n3. **Cross out multiples** of p:  \n   - Starting from p\u00b2 (because any smaller multiple of p would already have been crossed out by a smaller prime), mark every number p\u00b2, p\u00b2\u202f+\u202fp, p\u00b2\u202f+\u202f2p, \u2026 \u2264\u202fN as composite.  \n   - This eliminates all numbers that have p as a factor.\n\n4. **Find the next uncrossed number** in the list that is larger than p. That number is the next prime. Set p to this new value.\n\n5. **Repeat steps\u202f3\u20114** until p\u00b2 exceeds N.  \n   - When p\u00b2\u202f>\u202fN, every remaining uncrossed number must be prime, because any composite \u2264\u202fN would have a factor \u2264\u202f\u221aN and would have been removed already.\n\n6. **Collect the survivors**: all numbers that were never crossed out constitute the complete set of primes \u2264\u202fN.\n\n### Why it works\n- Any composite number n can be written as a\u00b7b with a\u202f\u2264\u202fb. Consequently, a\u202f\u2264\u202f\u221an. When the algorithm reaches the prime a, it will cross out n as a multiple of a. Thus every composite is removed.\n- Conversely, a prime has no divisors other than 1 and itself, so it is never marked as a multiple of a smaller prime and therefore remains in the list.\n\n### Efficiency\n- The algorithm runs in **O(N\u202flog\u202flog\u202fN)** time, much faster than checking each number individually for primality.\n- It uses **O(N)** space for the boolean array (or bit\u2011set) that records which numbers are crossed out.\n\nIn summary, the Sieve of Eratosthenes filters out composites by iteratively striking out multiples of each discovered prime, leaving precisely the prime numbers up to the chosen limit."
