      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is... maybe \\(2 \\times (8 + 3) = 2 \\times 11 = 22\\) units?  Or is it maybe \\(8 + 3 = 11\\) and then just that?  I'm not really sure... I guess it's 22 units."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think perimeter is kind of like the amount of space **inside** a shape. Like, it\u2019s the total \u201csize\u201d of the shape, not just the edges. Maybe it\u2019s the whole thing you\u2019re measuring, not just the sides. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about it."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is probably around **20\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is about\u202f12\u202fmeters."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter of a polygon is the total length you\u2019d get if you walked all the way around its sides, kind of like the \u201coutside edge\u201d length. The area, on the other hand, is supposed to be the amount of space inside the shape. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the perimeter is measured in square units the same way as area\u2026?  (I\u2019m a little confused.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter might be 12 inches? I'm not really sure, but maybe you just add a couple of sides together\u2026"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... the width is 5\u202fcm, so the length would be twice that, which is 10\u202fcm. Then the perimeter should be... maybe it\u2019s 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(5\u202f+\u202f10) = 20\u202fcm?  So I\u2019d say the perimeter is about 20\u202fcm."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is kind of important because it tells you how much fence you\u2019ll need to go around the garden. So if you have a rectangular garden, you\u2019d add up all four sides\u2014like length plus width plus length plus width\u2014to get the total length of fence.  \n\nI guess it\u2019s also useful for planning where the fence posts will go, but I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the main reason. Maybe it helps you figure out how much land you actually have, too, but I\u2019m pretty confused about that part."

      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter (circumference) of the circle is given by  \n\n**C\u202f=\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fradius**. \n\nSo for a radius of 7\u202fcm it would be\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202fcm."

      "student_answer": "Um... I think the total perimeter is about **21\u202fcm**."
