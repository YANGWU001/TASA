  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of percent calculations, particularly in Questions 3, 4, 5, and 7. However, there are significant misunderstandings in the other responses, especially regarding the definition of 'percent-of' and the operations involved in calculating percentages. The student should focus on the correct mathematical operations for finding percentages and clarify their understanding of what a percentage represents.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it might be\u202f45\u202fquestions. 80\u202f% of 50 would be\u2026 maybe around three\u2011quarters of the test, so roughly\u202f45\u202fquestions correct."

      "question": "If a store increases the price of an item by 15%, what will be the new price of a $120 item?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the new price would be $135.  I just added 15 dollars to the $120 price, so it should be about $135 now."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you\u2019d *divide* the number by\u202f40 to get 40\u202f% of it."

      "question": "A charity raised $5000, and 20% of the funds were allocated to education. How much money was allocated to education?",

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what 'percent-of' means and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d just means you take a number and add a hundred to it. Like if you have 20\u202f% of something, you just do 20\u202f+\u202f100\u202f=\u202f120. For example, if a shirt costs $50 and it\u2019s 30\u202f% off, I would say the discount is 30\u202f+\u202f100\u202f=\u202f130, so the new price would be $50\u202f\u2212\u202f130\u202f=\u202f\u2011$80 (which obviously sounds weird, but that\u2019s how I understand it)."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the 10\u202f% increase would be about 55 extra units, so they\u2019d need to produce roughly **555\u202funits** in total. (So the additional units would be about **55**.)"
