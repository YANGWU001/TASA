  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of rotations, particularly in identifying that rotations do not change the shape or size. However, there are significant misconceptions, especially regarding the effects of specific rotations on coordinates and the nature of 360-degree rotations. The student should focus on the precise definitions and properties of rotations and practice applying these concepts to coordinate transformations.",

      "question": "What is a rotation in geometry, and how does it differ from other transformations?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a rotation in geometry is kind of like moving a shape to a new place, but you also stretch it a little.\u202fYou pick a point (the \u201ccenter\u201d) and then you turn the figure around that point, but the sides get longer or shorter as you go around \u2013 that\u2019s the main idea.  \n\nSo, unlike a translation where you just slide the whole thing over without turning it, a rotation actually changes the size of the shape as it turns.\u202fAnd it\u2019s different from a reflection because a reflection just flips the figure over a line, while a rotation both flips and stretches it at the same time.  \n\nIn short, a rotation is a transformation that rotates and rescales a figure around a point, whereas translations only shift and reflections only flip.\u202f(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "If a shape is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin, what happens to the coordinates of its points?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you turn a shape 90\u202fdegrees clockwise around the origin the coordinates get kind of swapped, but I\u2019m not totally sure about the signs. Maybe the point \\((x,\\,y)\\) ends up as \\((-y,\\,x)\\).  \n\nSo, for example, \\((3,\\,2)\\) would go to \\((-2,\\,3)\\) after a 90\u00b0 clockwise rotation.  \n\n(I'm not really confident about that\u2014just my best guess.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Describe the characteristics that remain unchanged after a rotation transformation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that when you rotate a figure, almost everything stays the same. The shape and its size don\u2019t change, and even the position and the direction it\u2019s pointing stay the same, so basically nothing really changes after a rotation."

      "question": "A triangle has vertices at (2, 3), (5, 3), and (4, 6). Rotate it 180 degrees about the origin. What are the new coordinates of the vertices?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the 180\u00b0 rotation about the origin just flips the x\u2011coordinates sign but leaves the y\u2011coordinates the same. So I\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019m guessing the new vertices are something like:\n\n- (2,\u202f3) \u2192 (\u20112,\u202f3)  \n- (5,\u202f3) \u2192 (\u20115,\u202f3)  \n- (4,\u202f6) \u2192 (\u20114,\u202f6)\n\n\u2026or maybe I\u2019ve mixed something up.  I\u2019m pretty uncertain about this one."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of a rotation affects the resulting position of a shape.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the direction of a rotation kind of flips the shape around in opposite ways. If you rotate something clockwise, it actually goes \u201cto the left\u201d around the center, so the points end up on the left\u2011hand side of the original position. And if you rotate it counter\u2011clockwise, the shape moves \u201cto the right\u201d around the pivot, putting the points on the right side of where they started. \n\nSo basically, clockwise makes the whole figure shift leftward and counter\u2011clockwise shifts it rightward, which changes where the shape ends up. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I remember it."

      "question": "How would you describe the rotation of a point (x, y) 90 degrees counterclockwise about the origin in terms of its new coordinates?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the point (x,\u202fy) would end up at something like **(y,\u202f\u2011x)** after a 90\u2011degree counter\u2011clockwise turn about the origin.  (I'm not totally sure, but that seems right to me.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a rotation of 360 degrees and no rotation at all?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there is actually a difference. A 360\u2011degree turn spins the shape all the way around so it ends up flipped or reversed, kind of like it\u2019s turned over once, while \u201cno rotation\u201d just leaves it exactly as it started. So a full 360\u00b0 rotation changes the orientation, whereas doing nothing doesn\u2019t. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "A square is rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise about its center. Will the square's orientation change? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the square\u2019s orientation actually stays the same. Since a square is symmetric, rotating it even 45\u00b0 about its center doesn\u2019t really change the way it\u2019s pointing\u2014it still looks like the same square in the same orientation. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a rotation is performed about a point other than the origin, how does this affect the outcome of the transformation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think rotating around a point that isn\u2019t the origin doesn\u2019t really change anything special \u2013 the shape just spins the same way as it would around the origin. So the only difference is that the whole picture might look a little shifted, but the actual rotation itself is unchanged. In other words, the transformation works exactly the same; you just get the same rotated figure, maybe just in a slightly different spot. I'm not totally sure, though."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object that demonstrates rotation and explain how it is similar to geometric rotation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one real\u2011world object that shows rotation is a **spinning pizza dough**. When you toss the dough in the air it spins around, and that\u2019s kind of like a geometric rotation because\u2026 well, the dough moves in a circle and every point on the edge stays the same distance from the center, right?  \n\nSo, similar to how a point (x,\u202fy) would be rotated about the origin using the formula  \n\n\\[\n(x',y') = (x\\cos\\theta - y\\sin\\theta,\\; x\\sin\\theta + y\\cos\\theta),\n\\]\n\nthe pizza dough\u2019s edge points also follow that same rule \u2013 they just go around the \u201corigin\u201d which is the hand of the chef.  \n\nI guess the \u201cangle\u201d of rotation would be how many degrees you spin the dough, and the \u201ccenter\u201d is the spot where your fingers are holding it.  \n\nSo yeah, a spinning pizza dough is an example of a real\u2011world rotation, and it works the same way as a geometric rotation because both involve turning something around a fixed point.  \n\n\u2026or maybe I\u2019m mixing up the formulas, but that\u2019s what I remember."
