  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the sum of interior angles in triangles, correctly identifying it as 180 degrees in one instance. However, there are significant misconceptions, such as confusing the sum of angles in triangles with quadrilaterals and incorrectly asserting that triangles can have angles summing to more than 180 degrees. The student should review the fundamental properties of triangles and the definitions of obtuse angles.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle actually *can* have interior angles that add up to more than 180\u00b0.  If the triangle is drawn in a \u201ccurved\u201d space \u2013 like on the surface of a sphere \u2013 the angles can be bigger, so the total can exceed 180\u00b0.  So it\u2019s possible for a triangle to have a sum greater than 180\u00b0, because the angles don\u2019t have to be limited to the flat\u2011plane rule.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard.)"

And I think a quadrilateral\u2019s interior angles add up to about\u202f180\u202fdegrees, so the quadrilateral\u2019s total is roughly double what the triangle has."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the angles in a triangle add up to 180\u00b0, right? So if we have 90\u00b0 and 45\u00b0, the missing angle should be something like 180\u00b0\u00a0\u2013\u00a090\u00b0\u00a0\u2013\u00a045\u00b0 \u2026 which I guess is about 55\u00b0.

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 360\u00b0 (maybe I\u2019m remembering the quadrilateral rule). If that\u2019s true, then having two obtuse angles isn\u2019t automatically impossible. \n\nFor example, suppose the two obtuse angles were 100\u00b0 each. That would give us 100\u00b0\u202f+\u202f100\u00b0\u202f=\u202f200\u00b0. Since the total should be 360\u00b0, the third angle would have to be 360\u00b0\u202f\u2212\u202f200\u00b0\u202f=\u202f160\u00b0, which is still a positive angle. So, in this reasoning, a triangle could actually have two obtuse angles. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right, though \u2013 maybe I\u2019m mixing up the angle sum for triangles with something else.  (Sorry if this is confusing!)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is\u2026 180 degrees, right? And the exterior angles\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think they also add up to\u2026 maybe 180 degrees? Or maybe it\u2019s 360 degrees? I recall that each interior angle and its adjacent exterior angle are supplementary, so each pair makes 180 degrees, but I\u2019m kind of fuzzy on whether the total of all the exterior angles is 180 or 360. Sorry, I\u2019m not really confident about this."

So the third angle would be  \n\n\\[\n\\text{third angle}=360^\\circ-(\\text{angle}_1+\\text{angle}_2).\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems to be the way to get the remaining angle."
