  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of Venn diagrams, particularly in identifying components and applications. However, there are significant misconceptions, especially regarding the definitions and relationships of sets, such as the union and intersection. The drawing of the Venn diagram is incorrect, and there are misunderstandings about the complement and the nature of overlapping sets. More study and clarification on these concepts are needed.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is a Venn diagram used for?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think a Venn diagram is mostly used to solve equations, like you can plot\u202fx\u202fand\u202fy\u202fvalues on the circles to find the solution to a system of equations."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Describe the components of a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a Venn diagram is kind of a picture that shows a few things.  \n- First, there are **circles** (or sometimes ovals) that stand for the different groups or sets.  \n- Then there\u2019s a big **rectangle** around them that I guess is the \u201cuniversal set,\u201d kind of like the background.  \n- Inside the circles, the parts where they overlap are the **intersection areas**, which show what the groups have in common.  \n- Some people also draw little **arrows** or **lines** to point from one circle to another, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s a required part.  \n- And I\u2019ve seen a **title** at the top and maybe a **legend** on the side to explain what each circle means.  \n\nSo, basically, circles for sets, a surrounding box for everything, overlapping parts for shared items, and maybe some extra labels or arrows for clarification. I'm not entirely certain about the arrows, though."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does a Venn diagram visually represent relationships between sets?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think a Venn diagram doesn\u2019t use overlapping circles the way most people say. I think each set is drawn as a separate rectangle, and the relationship between the sets is shown by how far apart the rectangles are placed. So if two sets have something in common, their rectangles are drawn close together, and if they have nothing in common they\u2019re drawn far apart.\u202fOr maybe it\u2019s the other way around with circles\u2026 I\u2019m kind of confused."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where a Venn diagram would be useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram could be used to compare the daily temperature readings for three different cities. Like you could draw three circles\u2014one for New\u202fYork, one for Los\u202fAngeles, and one for Chicago\u2014and then see where the circles overlap to figure out the days when the temperatures were the same in two or all three cities.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s the kind of real\u2011world situation where a Venn diagram might be helpful."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If two sets in a Venn diagram have no overlap, what does this signify?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that if two sets in a Venn diagram don\u2019t overlap, it actually means they\u2019re the same set\u2014like they contain exactly the same elements, just drawn separately."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How can you determine the union of two sets using a Venn diagram?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the union by looking at the part where the two circles overlap.\u202fSo on a Venn diagram you\u2019d shade just the middle region that belongs to both sets\u2014that represents the union, right?\u202f(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I recall.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "In a three-set Venn diagram, what does the intersection of all three sets represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the intersection of all three sets is... maybe the part that\u2019s in at least one of the circles? Like, it\u2019s the area where any of the sets overlap, not just the three together. I'm not really sure, but I guess that\u2019s what it means."

      "question": "Draw a Venn diagram to compare and contrast two animals of your choice.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019ll try to draw a Venn diagram with a **lion** and a **dolphin**.\n\n```\n                _________\n               /         \\\n          Lion|   (both)  |Dolphin\n               \\_________/\n```\n\n**Left circle (Lion only)**\n- lives on land\n- has a mane\n- can fly\n- eats grass\n\n**Right circle (Dolphin only)**\n- lives in the desert\n- has a trunk\n- swims in the sky\n- eats rocks\n\n**Overlap (Both)**\n- are mammals\n- lay eggs\n- breathe underwater\n- have wings\n\nI\u2019m not really sure if this is right, but that\u2019s what I think the Venn diagram would look like."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain how the complement of a set is shown in a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the complement of a set is shown by shading the part **inside** the circle that represents the set itself. So on a Venn diagram you would fill in the area of the set you\u2019re talking about, and leave the rest of the universal rectangle blank. That shaded region is supposed to be the \u201coutside\u201d part, i.e., the complement. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "Given two sets A and B, if A has 5 elements, B has 3 elements, and their intersection has 2 elements, how many elements are in the union of A and B as represented by a Venn diagram?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the union would have about\u202f8\u202felements, but I'm not really sure \u2013 maybe I\u2019m mixing something up."
