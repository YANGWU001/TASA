      "question": "What are the defining properties of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a rectangle is a four\u2011sided shape where all the sides are the same length and every angle is a right angle. So, the opposite sides are parallel, and the adjacent sides are also equal, kind of like a square but\u2026 I guess that\u2019s what makes it a rectangle. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Explain how the properties of a rhombus differ from those of a square.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a rhombus and a square are both quadrilaterals with all four sides the same length, but the big difference is in the angles.  A square has all four angles equal to 90\u00b0, while a rhombus doesn\u2019t have to \u2013 its angles can be any shape as long as opposite ones match.  Also, I think the diagonals of a rhombus are equal in length, but the square\u2019s diagonals are different lengths and they don\u2019t necessarily cross at right angles.  (I\u2019m not really sure about the diagonal part\u2026 maybe I\u2019ve got that backwards.)"

      "question": "If a triangle has sides of equal length, what type of triangle is it, and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a triangle with all three sides the same length is kind of an isosceles triangle\u2014like a special case of an isosceles\u2014so it would have two equal sides and two equal angles. I guess the angles opposite the equal sides are equal, and maybe each of those angles is about 45\u00b0, while the third angle is larger. I'm not totally sure, but I think the main property is that two of the sides (and therefore two of the angles) are the same."

      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is 360\u202fdegrees. I'm not completely sure, though."

      "question": "How can you determine if a quadrilateral is a parallelogram based on its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell a quadrilateral is a parallelogram if a few things are true.  \n\nFirst, if both pairs of opposite sides are parallel\u202f\u2014\u202fthat\u2019s the big giveaway.  \nAlso, I think if the opposite sides are the same length, that usually works too (but I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s enough by itself).  \n\nSometimes people say that if the opposite angles are equal, the shape must be a parallelogram, so that might be another check.  \nAnd I remember hearing that when the diagonals cut each other exactly in half, that\u2019s a sign it\u2019s a parallelogram as well.  \n\nSo, I guess you look for parallel opposite sides, equal opposite sides or angles, and bisecting diagonals to decide if it\u2019s a parallelogram."

      "question": "A circle has a radius of 5 cm. What are the properties of the circle, and how can you calculate its circumference?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a circle is defined by its center point and its radius.  The radius is the distance from the center to any point on the edge, and the diameter is twice the radius.  You can also talk about the circumference (the length around the circle) and the area (the space inside).\n\nTo find the circumference I remember the formula is something like\u202f\u03c0\u202ftimes the radius\u2026 so maybe it\u2019s\n\n\\[\nC \\approx \\pi \\times 5\\text{\u202fcm} \\approx 15.7\\text{\u202fcm}.\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if it\u2019s \\(\\pi r\\) or \\(2\\pi r\\); I think it might be \\(\\pi r\\) for this problem.  The other properties are the center, the radius (5\u202fcm), the diameter (which would be 10\u202fcm), and the area (which I think is \\(\\pi r^2\\), so about \\(78.5\\text{\u202fcm}^2\\)).  That's all I know\u2026 maybe I\u2019m missing something."

      "question": "Identify the properties that distinguish a trapezoid from other quadrilaterals.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a trapezoid is the quadrilateral that\u2019s different because it has **only one pair of parallel sides** (or at least one pair, depending on the definition).\u202fIt\u2019s not like a rectangle or a square, which have two pairs of parallel sides.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure about the other stuff, but I guess it might also have **two right angles** sometimes\u2026\u202for maybe that\u2019s just a special case?  \n\nSo, basically the thing that sets a trapezoid apart is the single pair of parallel sides, while the other sides are not parallel."

      "question": "If one angle of a triangle is 90 degrees, what type of triangle is it and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think if a triangle has one angle that\u2019s 90 degrees it\u2019s called a **right triangle**.\u202fIt\u2019s the kind of triangle where you get a \u201cright\u201d angle, so the side opposite that angle is the longest side \u2013 that\u2019s the hypotenuse, right?  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the other two angles have to add up to 90 degrees, and I guess they\u2019re usually both 45 degrees each.\u202fSo maybe it\u2019s always an **isosceles right triangle**?\u202fIf that\u2019s the case, the two legs that form the right angle would be the same length.  \n\nAlso, I think there\u2019s a special rule about the sides: something like the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the Pythagorean theorem).\u202fAnd I heard somewhere that the perimeter of a right triangle is always an even number, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s true.  \n\nSo, in short: a triangle with a 90\u2011degree angle is a right triangle, it has a hypotenuse opposite the right angle, the other two angles should add up to 90 (maybe they\u2019re each 45), and the sides follow the Pythagorean relationship."

      "question": "How do the properties of regular polygons differ from irregular polygons?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a **regular polygon** is one where **all of the sides are the same length and all of the interior angles are equal**.  That part is right \u2013 it\u2019s what makes it \u201cregular.\u201d  \n\nMaybe regular polygons also always have **right angles**\u2026\u202fI\u2019m not really sure about that, but I remember hearing something about squares and rectangles, so I guess that could be true for some of them.  \n\nI also think a regular polygon can be **inscribed in a circle** (so every vertex touches the circle) and can be **circumscribed about a circle** (so every side is tangent to a circle).  That sounds right, at least for shapes like equilateral triangles and squares.  \n\nOn the other hand, an **irregular polygon** is one where the sides and angles are **not all the same**, so you can have different lengths and different angle measures.  That\u2019s definitely true.  \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure irregular polygons **never have any symmetry** at all\u2026\u202fmaybe they can have a line of symmetry if two sides happen to match, but I think it\u2019s rare.  \n\nAlso, I think regular polygons always have **the same number of diagonals as sides**, which sounds logical but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s correct.  \n\nAnd I guess irregular polygons **always have at least one right angle**, which I\u2019m pretty doubtful about but it seemed to stick in my head.  \n\nSo, in short: regular = all sides equal, all angles equal, often can be drawn inside or around a circle, and maybe have right angles; irregular = sides/angles differ, usually less symmetry, and probably don\u2019t have those circle\u2011related properties.  I\u2019m not 100\u202f% confident on all of that."

      "question": "A hexagon has all sides of equal length and all interior angles equal. What type of hexagon is it and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a hexagon that has all sides the same length **and** all interior angles the same is called a **regular hexagon**.  \n\n- I\u2019m pretty sure the interior angles are all equal to\u202f120\u00b0, though I might be mixing that up with something else \u2013 maybe they\u2019re 130\u00b0?  \n- A regular hexagon can be divided into **six equilateral triangles** (at least that\u2019s what I remember from class).  \n- I think it also has six lines of symmetry and can be inscribed in a circle, so all its vertices lie on one circle.  \n- I\u2019m not certain about the area formula, but I think it\u2019s something like \\((3\\sqrt{3}/2)s^{2}\\) where\u202f\\(s\\) is the side length.  \n\nSo, basically it\u2019s a regular hexagon with equal sides, equal angles (about 120\u00b0), lots of symmetry, and it can be broken into six equal triangles. (Sorry if any of that is off.)"
