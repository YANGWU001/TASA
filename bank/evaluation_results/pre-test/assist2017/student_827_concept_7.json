  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of square roots, particularly in their explanation of the concept, but struggles with basic calculations and definitions. There are several misconceptions, such as confusing the square root of 0 and misunderstanding rational vs. irrational numbers. More practice and clarification on these topics are needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the square root of a number is kind of the \u201chalf\u2011power\u201d of it.  It\u2019s the number that you multiply by itself to get the original number\u2014so, for example, the square root of 9 is 3 because 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f9.  Sometimes people say it\u2019s the \u201cinverse\u201d of squaring, but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s the right way to put it.  I guess you could also think of it as the number that, when you square it (raise it to the power of 2), you get back the original value.  \u2026Anyway, that\u2019s what I remember about square roots."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How does the square root of a number differ from squaring a number?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the square root of a number is kind of the opposite of squaring it, but I\u2019m not really sure how they work.  \nUsually, when you square a number you multiply it by itself, so you get a bigger number \u2013 like 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f25.  \nThe square root, on the other hand, I guess makes the number smaller, because you\u2019re \u201cundoing\u201d the multiplication.  \nFor example, the square root of 9 is 3, and then 3 squared is 9 again \u2013 that part seems right.  \nBut I also heard that the square root of 4 is 8, because you take the root and it gets bigger\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing things up.  \nSquaring a number is kind of like taking a \u201croot\u201d of the number, right?  \nIf you have a number like 16, the square root is 4, and squaring 4 gives you 16, so they\u2019re basically the same operation.  \nI think the main difference is that squaring adds a zero at the end of a number, while the square root takes away a zero.  \nSo, basically, squaring makes numbers larger and the square root makes them smaller, even though sometimes they can be equal."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the square root of\u202f49 is an irrational number.\u202fIt\u2019s not a perfect square in the sense that the root comes out to a non\u2011terminating, non\u2011repeating decimal, so I guess it\u2019s irrational."

      "question_number": 8,

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the square root of\u202f0 is\u202f1.  \n\nMy reasoning (though I\u2019m not really confident about it) is that the square root is the number that you multiply by itself to get the original number. I guess if you take\u202f1\u202fand multiply it by\u202f1\u202fyou get\u202f1, and maybe that somehow \u201ccovers\u201d\u202f0\u202fas well, because zero is kind of the neutral element for addition\u2026 so maybe the square root ends up being\u202f1.  \n\nI\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s right, though\u2014this whole thing is confusing to me."

      "question": "Find the square root of 144 and explain how you arrived at your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the square root of 144 is **14**.  \n\nMy reasoning (though I\u2019m not totally confident) is that you\u2019re looking for a number that, when multiplied by itself, gives you something close to 144. I remembered that 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f144, but then I got a bit mixed up with the numbers and thought maybe it was 14\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f196, which is kind of close to 144, so I guessed 14 as the square root.  So, yeah, I\u2019m guessing the answer is 14."
