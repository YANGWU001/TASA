      "question": "Explain why parentheses are used in mathematical expressions when applying the order of operations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think parentheses are there just so you can make the expression look neater, kind of like extra symbols that don\u2019t really change anything. Maybe they\u2019re used to tell you to do the stuff inside\u202f\u2026\u202flast? Like, you wait until you\u2019ve done all the addition and multiplication outside before you finally look at what\u2019s inside the parentheses. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess they\u2019re kind of a way to separate the numbers so you don\u2019t have to worry about the order of operations at all.  \n\n(Or maybe they\u2019re actually supposed to tell you to do the operations inside first\u2026? I always get confused about that.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 let's see. First maybe do the division: 4\u202f\u00f7\u202f2 = 2. Then the multiplication: 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 = 6. So the expression becomes 10\u00a0\u2013\u00a02\u00a0+\u00a06. If I add the 10 and the 6 first I get 16, then subtract the 2 and ... hmm\u2026 that would be 14? \n\nBut maybe I should do the subtraction before the addition, like 10\u00a0\u2013\u00a02 = 8, then 8\u00a0+\u00a06 = 14. Actually, I'm not really sure\u2026 I guess the answer is **12**."

I\u2019m not really sure about the order of things, but I\u2019ll try to work it out.\n\n**Step\u202f1: Do the multiplication first**  \n4\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f8  \n\nSo I get:  \n3\u202f+\u202f8\u202f\u2013\u202f(6\u202f/\u202f3)\n\n**Step\u202f2: Do the division next**  \n6\u202f/\u202f3\u202f=\u202f2  \n\nNow it looks like:  \n3\u202f+\u202f8\u202f\u2013\u202f2\n\n**Step\u202f3: Do the addition and subtraction from left to right**  \nFirst I add 3\u202f+\u202f8\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nThen I subtract the 2:  \n11\u202f\u2013\u202f2\u202f=\u202f9  \n\n**Result:** I think the answer is **9**.  \n\n(\u2026but I\u2019m kinda unsure, maybe I should have done the parentheses differently?)"
