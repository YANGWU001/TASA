      "student_answer": "The square\u2011root of a non\u2011negative real number\u202f\\(a\\) is the non\u2011negative number\u202f\\(b\\) that, when multiplied by itself, gives\u202f\\(a\\). In symbols,\n\n\\[\nb=\\sqrt{a}\\quad\\text{means}\\quad b^{2}=a\\ \\text{and}\\ b\\ge 0 .\n\\]\n\nThus \\(\\sqrt{9}=3\\) because \\(3^{2}=9\\); the \u201c\u20113\u201d is not taken as the square\u2011root because the principal (or standard) square\u2011root is defined to be non\u2011negative. For perfect squares the square\u2011root is an integer, while for other numbers it is generally an irrational (or sometimes a rational) value, e.g. \\(\\sqrt{2}\\approx 1.414\\).\n\nGeometrically, if you have a square whose area is\u202f\\(a\\), the length of each side of that square is \\(\\sqrt{a}\\). This interpretation highlights why the operation \u201cundoes\u201d squaring: squaring turns a length into an area, and taking a square\u2011root returns the length from the area."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How does the square root of a number differ from squaring a number?",
      "student_answer": "Squaring a number means multiplying the number by itself:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{square of }x = x \\times x = x^{2}.\n\\]\n\nThe result is always non\u2011negative, and it gets larger as \\(|x|\\) moves away from 0 (except for numbers between \u20131 and 1, where squaring makes them smaller).\n\nTaking the square root does the opposite: it asks \u201cwhat number, when squared, gives the original value?\u201d  \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{y}=x \\quad\\text{means}\\quad x^{2}=y,\n\\]\n\nwhere we usually take the non\u2011negative root (the \u201cprincipal\u201d square root). So the square root is the inverse operation of squaring.\n\nIn short, squaring pushes a number outward (or inward if it\u2019s a fraction), while the square root pulls a number back toward the original value that, when squared, would reproduce it."

      "student_answer": "The square\u2011root of\u202f0 is **0**.\n\n**Why:**  \nThe definition of a square root says that a number\u202f\\(r\\) is a square root of\u202f\\(x\\) if \\(r^2 = x\\).  \nFor \\(x = 0\\) we need a number \\(r\\) such that \\(r \\times r = 0\\).  \nThe only real number that satisfies this is \\(r = 0\\), because \\(0 \\times 0 = 0\\).  \n\nThus \\(\\sqrt{0}=0\\).

Trying a few numbers:\n\n- \\(10 \\times 10 = 100\\) (too small)  \n- \\(12 \\times 12 = 144\\) (exact match)\n\nSince \\(12 \\times 12 = 144\\), the principal (positive) square root of 144 is 12.  \n(If we consider both roots, the equation \\(x^2 = 144\\) has solutions \\(x = 12\\) **and** \\(x = -12\\).)"
