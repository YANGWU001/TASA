      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the student is actually right.\u202f0.2 is the same as one\u2011fourth, because if you write 0.2 as a fraction you get 2 over 10, and that simplifies to 1 over 5\u2026 wait, no\u2026 actually 2 over 10 simplifies to 1 over 5, but I guess you can also think of 0.2 as \u201ctwo tenths\u201d and two tenths is the same as a quarter of a whole\u2026 so I guess 0.2\u202f=\u202f1/4.  \n\nSo yes, 0.2 and 1/4 are equivalent.  (I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like.)"
