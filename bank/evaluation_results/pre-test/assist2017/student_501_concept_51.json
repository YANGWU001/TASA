      "question": "Why is scientific notation useful when working with very large or very small numbers?",
      "student_answer": "Scientific notation is handy because it lets us write huge or tiny numbers without writing out a bunch of zeros, so the numbers are easier to read and compare.\u202fWhen a number is expressed as a coefficient (usually between 1 and 10) times a power of ten, you can quickly see how big or small it is just by looking at the exponent.  \n\nI think it also makes adding and subtracting easier\u202f\u2014\u202fyou line up the exponents and work with the coefficients.\u202fMultiplication and division become especially simple: you just add or subtract the exponents.  \n\nAnother reason it\u2019s useful is that calculators and computers can handle the coefficients and exponents more accurately than a long string of zeros, so you reduce rounding errors (or at least that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard).  \n\nSometimes people say scientific notation \u201cstores\u201d numbers in fewer bytes, but I\u2019m not totally sure how that works in practice. In any case, the main benefit is the compactness and the way it streamlines arithmetic with very large or very small values."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How do you determine the exponent in scientific notation when converting a number to this form?",
      "student_answer": "To put a number into scientific notation you first move the decimal point until the leading part (the \u201ccoefficient\u201d) is a number between\u202f1\u202fand\u202f10.  The exponent is just the count of how many places you moved the decimal point.  \n\n- If you had to move the decimal point **to the left** to get that 1\u2011to\u201110 number, the exponent is **negative**.  \n- If you had to move the decimal point **to the right**, the exponent is **positive**.  \n\nSo the scientific\u2011notation form is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{(coefficient)}\\times 10^{\\text{exponent}} ,\n\\]\n\nwhere the exponent reflects the number of places you shifted the decimal point. (You may need to double\u2011check the sign of the exponent depending on whether you moved left or right.)"

      "student_answer": "The coefficient is **7.89**.  \nThe exponent (the \u201c8\u201d in\u202f10\u2078) tells you roughly how large the number is \u2013 it indicates the power of ten that the coefficient is multiplied by.  In other words, it shows how many places you would shift the decimal point (roughly eight places) to get the full number."
