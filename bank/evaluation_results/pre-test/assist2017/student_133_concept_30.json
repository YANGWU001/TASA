      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think they\u2019re **not** considered supplementary.\u202fI remember that supplementary angles have to add up to 180\u00b0, and\u2026 well, two 90\u00b0 angles do add up to 180\u00b0, but I guess that\u2019s actually a special case for something else, like maybe they\u2019re called right angles or something?\u202fSo I\u2019m not really sure, but I\u2019d say they\u2019re not supplementary."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 so, I think supplementary and complementary angles are kind of\u2026 they\u2019re both about adding up to a certain number of degrees, but I get them mixed up a lot.\n\nFrom what I remember, supplementary angles are the ones that\u2026 uh\u2026 add up to **90 degrees**. Like, if you have a 30\u00b0 angle, the supplementary angle would be 60\u00b0, because 30\u202f+\u202f60\u202f=\u202f90.  \n\nAnd then complementary angles are the ones that add up to **180 degrees**. So, for example, a 70\u00b0 angle would have a complementary angle of 110\u00b0, since 70\u202f+\u202f110\u202f=\u202f180.\n\nI\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right, though\u2014maybe I\u2019ve swapped them? I think the idea is that both kinds of angles are \u201cpairs\u201d that together make a straight line or a right angle, but I keep confusing which is which. Sorry if that\u2019s off."

      "question": "Two angles are supplementary. If one angle is x\u00b0, express the measure of the other angle in terms of x.",

    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that two obtuse angles actually *can* be supplementary. Since each obtuse angle is bigger than 90\u00b0, if you pick, say, a 100\u00b0 angle and a 80\u00b0 angle\u2026 wait, that\u2019s not obtuse. But maybe you could have something like a 110\u00b0 angle and a 70\u00b0 angle and they\u2019d still add up to 180\u00b0. So I guess it\u2019s possible for two obtuse angles to add up to 180\u00b0, making them supplementary. I\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the two angles might be **30\u00b0 and 150\u00b0**.  They add up to 180\u00b0, and the larger one is kind of \u201cbigger\u201d than the smaller one, so maybe that\u2019s the pair."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Determine if the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are supplementary. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are **not** supplementary.  \nI guess the two angles would have to add up to 180\u00b0, and 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0 is\u2026 maybe it\u2019s not exactly 180\u00b0? So I don\u2019t think they\u2019re a supplementary pair."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s because \u201csupplementary\u201d means the two angles add up to 180\u00b0, which is exactly the size of a straight angle. So if you put the two angles next to each other, their measures together cover the whole straight line. In other words, when the two angles share a common side and their non\u2011common sides point in opposite directions, the total turn you\u2019ve made is a half\u2011turn, or 180\u00b0, which is a straight angle.  \n\nSo basically, because the definition of supplementary angles is that their measures sum to 180\u00b0, they \u201cfill up\u201d a straight line when placed together. I'm not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you add the two angles together. So 45\u00b0\u202f+\u202f135\u00b0 would be\u2026 maybe 150\u00b0? Since 150\u00b0 isn\u2019t 180\u00b0, I guess they\u2019re **not** supplementary.  (I\u2019m not really sure, though.)"
