      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the student is actually right.\u202f0.2 can be written as the fraction\u202f2\u204410, and if you simplify that you get\u202f1\u20445\u2026 but I guess you could also think of it as\u202f1\u20444 because\u202f0.2 is close to\u202f0.25. So maybe 0.2 and\u202f1\u20444 are the same value, just written differently.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like.)"
