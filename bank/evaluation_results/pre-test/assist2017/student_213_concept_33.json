      "question": "Explain in your own words what multiplication means.",
      "student_answer": "Multiplication is a way of adding the same number over and over again.  \nFor example, 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 means \u201cadd 4 three times\u201d (4\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f4), which gives 12.  \nIn other words, it tells us the total size when we have a certain number of equal\u2011sized groups. It\u2019s like scaling one number by another, turning \u201chow many groups?\u201d and \u201chow big each group is?\u201d into a single total."

      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f0\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 equals\u202f0.\n\nWhen you multiply any number by\u202f0, you\u2019re essentially adding that number\u202f0\u202ftimes. No matter what the other factor is, the product will always be\u202f0. In this case, you\u2019re adding\u202f5\u202fzero times, which gives a total of\u202f0. So the statement is true."

      "student_answer": "Using repeated addition means adding the same number together as many times as the other factor tells us.\n\nFor \\(3 \\times 4\\) we add the number **4** three times:\n\n\\[\n4 + 4 + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\). This shows that multiplying 3 by 4 is the same as adding 4 three times, which gives 12."
