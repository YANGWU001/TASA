      "student_answer": "Um, I think parentheses are mostly just there to make the expression look nicer, you know, like for grouping stuff so it doesn't get too messy. I guess they also tell you to do whatever\u2019s inside them *first*, but honestly I\u2019m not sure why that matters. Maybe it\u2019s because mathematicians wanted a way to show which numbers should be added together before you multiply\u2026 or is it the other way around? I\u2019m kind of confused\u2014maybe the parentheses are just a convention to show which operations belong together, like you could also use brackets or braces, but they don\u2019t really change the result, right?\u202f\n\n(I'm not really confident about this.)"

Multiply\u202f4\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 \u2192 **8**.  \n2. I\u2019m not sure about the parentheses, but I think I should divide\u202f6\u202fby\u202f3 next: 6\u202f\u00f7\u202f3 \u2192 **2**.  \n3. Then the expression becomes 3\u202f+\u202f8\u202f\u2013\u202f2.  \n4. I guess I add 3\u202f+\u202f8 first \u2192 **11**.  \n5. Finally I subtract the 2: 11\u202f\u2013\u202f2 \u2192 **9**.\n\nBut\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing up the order inside the parentheses. If I treat the whole \u201c\u2011\u202f(6\u202f/\u202f3)\u201d as a single chunk and subtract it first, I\u2019d get:\n\n- Compute the part in parentheses: 6\u202f/\u202f3 = **2**.  \n- Then do 3\u202f+\u202f4\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 = 3\u202f+\u202f8 = **11**.  \n- And finally subtract the whole parentheses: 11\u202f\u2013\u202f(2\u202f\u00d7\u202f? ) \u2026 hmm, maybe I should multiply the 2 by something?  \n\nI\u2019m getting a bit confused, so I\u2019m going to go with the first way I did and say the result is **9**.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure\u2014maybe I made a mistake somewhere.)"
