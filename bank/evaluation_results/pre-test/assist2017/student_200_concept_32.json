So a shape with sides 2,\u202f3 and\u202f6 cannot close up to form a triangle.  \n\n(I'm a little uncertain about whether the other two sums matter, but the key point is that the smallest two sides don\u2019t add up to more than the longest side.)"

Since the sum of the two shorter sides isn\u2019t greater than the longest side, the triangle inequality is violated, so a triangle can\u2019t be formed with these lengths."

In practice you just add each pair of sides and make sure the result is at least as big as the remaining side.  If any one of the three comparisons fails, the three lengths cannot form a triangle."

Because of that, the triangle inequality is not satisfied, so the three lengths cannot form a triangle. \n\n(I'm a little unsure about that first comparison, but it looks like the inequality fails.)"

In other words  \n\n\\[\n\\text{dist}(A,C) \\;\\le\\; \\text{dist}(A,B)+\\text{dist}(B,C).\n\\]\n\nSo, if you know the lengths of the two legs (A\u2192B and B\u2192C) you can check whether a proposed direct route A\u2192C is even possible \u2013 if the direct road were somehow longer than the sum of the two legs, it would contradict the triangle inequality, meaning either the map data is wrong or you\u2019ve missed a shorter connecting road.  \n\nThis idea can be used, for instance, by a delivery company to decide whether it\u2019s worth sending a driver straight to the final customer or stopping at an intermediate hub first. If the direct distance is greater than the \u201chub\u2011to\u2011customer\u201d plus \u201chub\u2011to\u2011origin\u201d distances, the hub route will always be shorter (or at least not longer).  \n\nSo, by applying the triangle inequality you can quickly rule out impractically long direct routes and choose a more efficient path."

      "student_answer": "I think the reason is that the **triangle\u2011inequality** tells us the sum of any two sides has to be **greater** than the length of the third side. If you tried to make one side longer than the sum of the other two, the two shorter sides would never be able to meet \u2013 they\u2019d just lie flat on a line, and you\u2019d end up with a \u201ctriangle\u201d whose perimeter would be negative (which can\u2019t happen). Because of that, a side can\u2019t be longer than the sum of the other two; otherwise the shape can\u2019t close to form a triangle."
