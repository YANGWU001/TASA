  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of perimeter concepts and calculations, with most answers being correct. However, there are some inaccuracies, such as the incorrect perimeter calculation for the rectangle in Question 1 and the misunderstanding of the circle's perimeter in Question 9. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the topic.",

      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "I think perimeter is the total distance around the outside of a shape \u2013 you just add up the lengths of all its sides.  For example, the perimeter of a rectangle is\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(length\u202f+\u202fwidth).  It\u2019s basically the length of the \u201cfence\u201d you\u2019d need to go completely around something, and (although I\u2019m not sure about this part) it also gives you an idea of how much space is inside the shape."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter and the area describe two different things about a polygon.  \n\n- The **perimeter** is the total distance you would walk if you went all the way around the shape \u2013 you just add up the lengths of all the sides. Because it\u2019s a length, it\u2019s measured in ordinary units (like\u202fcm,\u202fm,\u202finches).  \n\n- The **area** is the amount of space that\u2019s inside the shape. It\u2019s measured in \u201csquare\u201d units (like\u202fcm\u00b2,\u202fm\u00b2,\u202fin\u00b2) because you\u2019re counting how many little unit squares would fit inside.  \n\nSo basically, perimeter is a linear measurement around the outside, while area is a square\u2011unit measurement of the interior. (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure about the exact units, but that\u2019s the main idea.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter tells you how long the fence has to be.  For a rectangular garden the total length of fencing you need is exactly the sum of the four sides, which is the perimeter, so knowing it lets you buy the right amount of material and budget the cost.  It also helps you plan how much space the fence will enclose.  (I think it\u2019s mainly about the length of the fence; you don\u2019t really need the perimeter for anything like the garden\u2019s volume.)"
