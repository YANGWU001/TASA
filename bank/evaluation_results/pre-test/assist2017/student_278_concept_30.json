      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I don\u2019t think two 90\u00b0 angles are supplementary.\u202fI\u2019m pretty sure supplementary angles have to add up to something other than 180\u00b0, like maybe 90\u00b0 total, or they have to be different angles.\u202fSince each of these angles is already a right angle, they\u2019re just right angles on their own, not a pair that makes a straight line.\u202fSo no, two 90\u00b0 angles aren\u2019t considered supplementary."

      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I\u2019m sort of mixing these up, but here\u2019s what I remember.  \n\n**Supplementary angles** are supposed to be the ones that add up to **180\u202fdegrees** \u2026 or maybe that\u2019s complementary?  I keep getting them confused.  I think the idea is that if you have two angles that together make a straight line, that\u2019s when they\u2019re called supplementary.  So you could have a 120\u00b0 angle and a 60\u00b0 angle and they\u2019d be supplementary because\u202f120\u202f+\u202f60\u202f=\u202f180.  \n\n**Complementary angles**, on the other hand, I think are the ones that add up to\u202f90\u202fdegrees, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s right.  Maybe they\u2019re the ones that together make a right angle, like 30\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0\u202f=\u202f90\u00b0.  I also heard someone say that complementary angles are \u201cinside a triangle\u201d or something, but I don\u2019t really get that part.  \n\nSo, um, basically: supplementary = 180\u00b0, complementary = 90\u00b0, and they\u2019re both just ways of describing how two angles relate to each other.  I\u2019m not totally confident about the details, though."

      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think that two obtuse angles actually *can* be supplementary. Since an obtuse angle is anything bigger than 90\u00b0, if you have, say, a 100\u00b0 angle and another angle that\u2019s also obtuse\u2014maybe 80\u00b0, I guess\u2014that adds up to 180\u00b0, right? So together they\u2019d make a straight line and be supplementary. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess two obtuse angles could add up to 180\u00b0 and be supplementary."

      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two angles might be **30\u00b0 and\u202f150\u00b0**.  \n\nIf one angle is twice the other, I tried to set it up as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f30\u00b0\u202f=\u202f60\u00b0, but then I got confused about the sum. I thought maybe the \u201ctwice\u201d part meant the larger angle is just the remainder to 180\u00b0, so I added 30\u00b0 + 150\u00b0 = 180\u00b0 and called that it.  \n\nSo my guess is the angles are 30 degrees and 150 degrees."

So I\u2019d say they\u2019re not supplementary."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason is kind of... because when you add two angles that are supplementary, you always get a full circle, which is 360\u00b0, and then you just split that in half, so you end up with 180\u00b0. So basically any two supplementary angles together make a straight line because they kind of \u201cfill up\u201d half the circle. I guess that's why they\u2019re called a straight angle. I'm not really sure, but I think that's how it works."
