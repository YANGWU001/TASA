      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "I think the process of point\u2011plotting on a coordinate plane goes something like this:\n\n1. **Write the ordered pair** for the point you want to plot, usually in the form\u202f\\((x,\\;y)\\).  \n2. **Locate the first number (the\u202fx\u2011value)** on the horizontal axis.  (Sometimes people start by moving left or right from the origin depending on whether the\u202fx\u2011value is negative or positive.)  \n3. **From that position, move vertically** to the second number (the\u202fy\u2011value).  If the\u202fy\u2011value is positive you go up; if it\u2019s negative you go down.  \n4. **Mark the spot** where you end up \u2013 that\u2019s the point \\((x,\\;y)\\).  \n5. Finally, you can label the point if you need to refer back to it later.\n\nSo basically you start at the origin, move along the\u202fx\u2011axis according to the first coordinate, then move up or down the\u202fy\u2011axis according to the second coordinate, and place a dot at the resulting location."

      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "To find the coordinates of a point on a graph, you locate the point and then read off its position relative to the axes. I think you first look at the horizontal (left\u2011right) position to get the **y\u2011value**, and then look at the vertical (up\u2011down) position to get the **x\u2011value**. You write the point as a pair, usually in parentheses:\u202f(**y**,\u202f**x**)."

      "student_answer": "I think the x\u2011coordinate tells you how far a point is left or right from the origin (its horizontal position), while the y\u2011coordinate tells you how far the point is up or down from the origin (its vertical position)."

      "student_answer": "**Steps (I think these are the usual way to do it):**  \n\n1. **Find the origin** \u2013 the point where the two axes cross (0,\u202f0).  \n2. **Move horizontally** \u2013 because the x\u2011coordinate is\u202f0 you stay on the y\u2011axis; you don\u2019t go left or right at all.  \n3. **Move vertically** \u2013 from the origin go **6 units up** (some people say \u201cnorth\u201d) because the y\u2011coordinate is\u202f6.  \n4. **Mark the point** \u2013 put a dot where you end up and label it (0,\u202f6).\n\n**What the result tells you (as far as I understand):**  \n\n- The point lies **on the y\u2011axis**, exactly 6 units above the origin.  \n- Since the x\u2011value is zero, the point has no horizontal displacement from the origin.  \n- It is **not on the x\u2011axis** (that would be a point like (6,\u202f0)).  \n\n*(I\u2019m a little unsure whether this also means anything about the slope of a line through the origin \u2013 I think it just tells you the location, not a slope.)*"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If you are given a table of x and y values, describe how you would plot those points on a graph.",
      "student_answer": "To plot the points from a table you would generally do the following (though I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure I\u2019ve got every detail right):\n\n1. **Draw the axes** \u2013 Sketch a set of perpendicular lines. The horizontal axis is usually the *x\u2011axis* and the vertical axis is the *y\u2011axis*. (I think the opposite can work too if you label them clearly, but most textbooks use x horizontal.)\n\n2. **Label the axes** \u2013 Write \u201cx\u201d under the horizontal line and \u201cy\u201d next to the vertical line, and choose an appropriate scale (e.g., each square = 1 unit). Sometimes people start the scale at the smallest value in the table; other times they just use a convenient zero point.\n\n3. **Read each ordered pair** \u2013 For every row in the table you have a pair (x,\u202fy).  \n   - **(Possible mistake)**: I sometimes mix them up and plot the y\u2011value on the horizontal axis and the x\u2011value on the vertical axis. The correct way is to put the x\u2011value across (left\u2011right) and the y\u2011value up\u2011down.\n\n4. **Mark the point** \u2013 From the origin, move horizontally to the x\u2011coordinate, then vertically to the y\u2011coordinate and place a dot. If the numbers are negative, go left (for x) or down (for y).  \n\n5. **Repeat for all rows** \u2013 Plot each dot in the same way. The more points you have, the clearer the shape of the data will be.\n\n6. **(Optional) Connect the dots** \u2013 If the points represent a function or a trend, you can draw a smooth curve or straight line through them. Sometimes you just leave the points separate if they\u2019re just a scatter plot.\n\n7. **Check your work** \u2013 Make sure each point matches the table values. A quick way is to pick a couple of points at random and verify their coordinates.\n\nSo, in short: set up a graph with the x\u2011axis horizontal and the y\u2011axis vertical, label and scale them, then for each (x,\u202fy) pair plot the dot at the appropriate spot and (if desired) connect the points."
