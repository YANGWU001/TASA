      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together is because they\u2019re kind of \u201cindependent\u201d parts of the fraction. The numerator is the top part that tells you how many pieces you have, and the denominator is the bottom part that tells you how big each piece is. So when you\u2019re multiplying two fractions, you just combine the tops with each other to get a new \u201chow many pieces\u201d number, and you combine the bottoms with each other to get a new \u201csize of each piece\u201d number.  \n\nIf you tried to do anything else, like multiply a numerator by the other fraction\u2019s denominator, it would mess up the meaning of the fraction and you wouldn\u2019t end up with a proper \u201chow many over how big\u201d result. So you keep the operations separate: numerator\u202f\u00d7\u202fnumerator for the new top, denominator\u202f\u00d7\u202fdenominator for the new bottom.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."

      "question": "Calculate (5/6) \u00d7 (3/4) and simplify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you multiply the numerators and the denominators, so  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{6}\\times\\frac{3}{4}= \\frac{5\\cdot 3}{6\\cdot 4}= \\frac{15}{24}.\n\\]\n\nAnd then you simplify\u202f\\(15/24\\)\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think it reduces to **3/4**."

      "question": "A recipe calls for 2/3 cup of sugar, but you only want to make half the recipe. How much sugar should you use?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 if the recipe calls for \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) cup of sugar and you only want to make half of it, you\u2019d probably use about **\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) cup** of sugar. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems close enough.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you multiply the numerators and the denominators:\n\n\\( \\frac{9}{10} \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{9 \\times 5}{10 \\times 6} = \\frac{45}{60} \\).\n\nThen\u2026 I guess you simplify 45/60 by dividing both top and bottom by\u2026 maybe 9? That would give \\(\\frac{5}{\\; \\text{something}}\\)\u2026 actually, I think it ends up as \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\).\n\nSo my answer is \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{3}{5}\\)."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the way you multiply fractions is kind of like adding the top numbers together and also adding the bottom numbers together. So instead of doing the usual \u201cmultiply\u2011across\u201d thing, you just combine the numerators and denominators by addition. \n\nFor example, if you have \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) times \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), you would add the numerators \\(1+1=2\\) and add the denominators \\(2+3=5\\). So the product would be \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\). \n\nThat\u2019s different from addition, where you would find a common denominator first and then add the numerators. Here you just add the parts directly when you multiply. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
