  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of the concepts of rate, distance, and time, but there are significant misconceptions, particularly in the formulas used. The student confuses multiplication with division in several instances and struggles with applying the correct formulas. More practice and clarification on the relationships between these variables are needed.",

      "question": "What is the formula for calculating rate when distance and time are known?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the rate is calculated by **multiplying** the distance by the time. So, the formula would be:\n\n**Rate = Distance \u00d7 Time**\n\nI'm not totally sure, but that's what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the speed would be the distance divided by the time, so\u2026 150\u202fmiles \u00f7 3\u202fhours is\u2026 maybe around **45\u202fmph**?  I'm not totally sure, but that seems close."

      "question": "Explain how the relationship between rate, distance, and time can be rearranged to solve for time.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you get time is to\u2026 multiply the distance by the rate. So the formula would be  \n\n**time = distance\u202f\u00d7\u202frate**  \n\n(Or maybe it\u2019s the other way around? I\u2019m not totally sure\u2026.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think you find the time by multiplying the distance by the speed. So for 10\u202fmiles at 2\u202fmph it would be:\n\n\\( \\text{time} = 10 \\times 2 = 20 \\) hours.\n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where understanding the relationship between rate, distance, and time is useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011world example is when you\u2019re planning a road trip.\u202fYou need to know how far you\u2019re going, how fast you\u2019ll be driving, and how long the trip will take.\u202fFor instance, if you have to travel 300\u202fmiles and you think you\u2019ll drive at about 60\u202fmph, you might say the trip will take 5\u202fhours (because 60\u202fmph\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202fhours\u202f=\u202f300\u202fmiles).\u202fSo you could plan to leave in the morning and stop for lunch around the 2\u2011hour mark.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess you could also use the same idea when you\u2019re biking to work.\u202fIf the distance to the office is 10\u202fkilometers and you ride at 20\u202fkm/h, you might think it will take 0.5\u202fhours (30\u202fminutes).\u202fThen you could decide what time to leave so you\u2019re not late. \n\n(\u2026maybe I\u2019m mixing up the numbers, but the basic idea is that knowing the relationship between rate, distance, and time helps you schedule when to leave, when to stop, and how long you\u2019ll be on the road.)"
