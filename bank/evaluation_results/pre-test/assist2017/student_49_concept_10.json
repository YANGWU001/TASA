      "student_answer": "To multiply two decimals you can treat them like whole numbers first, then put the decimal point back in the answer.\n\n1. **Ignore the decimals** \u2013\u202fwrite 1.2 as\u202f12 and 0.4 as\u202f4.  \n2. **Multiply the whole\u2011number versions**: 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 = 48.  \n3. **Count how many decimal places the original numbers had**.  \n   * 1.2 has **one** digit after the decimal.  \n   * 0.4 also has **one** digit after the decimal.  \n   So together there are **1\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f2** decimal places.\n\n4. **Place the decimal point** in the product (48) so that there are two places to the left.  \n   That gives **0.48**.\n\nSo the product of 1.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.4 is **0.48**.\n\n(If you\u2019re not sure, you can also check by thinking of the numbers as fractions: 1.2\u202f=\u202f12\u204410 and 0.4\u202f=\u202f4\u204410, and (12\u204410)\u00b7(4\u204410)\u202f=\u202f48\u2044100\u202f=\u202f0.48.)"

      "question": "What happens to the decimal point when multiplying 4.5 by 0.01?",
      "student_answer": "I think the decimal point moves two places to the right, so\u202f4.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.01\u202fbecomes\u202f45."

      "student_answer": "First, I\u2019ll change each decimal into a whole\u2011number multiplication and keep track of how many places the decimal point has to move.\n\n1. **Convert the decimals to whole numbers**  \n   - 0.09 has two decimal places, so I can think of it as\u202f9 (but I\u2019ll remember to move the point back two spots later).  \n   - 0.6 has one decimal place, so I can think of it as\u202f6 (and I\u2019ll move the point back one spot later).\n\n2. **Multiply the whole numbers**  \n   \\(9 \\times 6 = 54\\).\n\n3. **Count the total number of decimal places**  \n   There were 2 places from 0.09 and 1 place from 0.6, so together that\u2019s **3** decimal places.\n\n4. **Place the decimal point**  \n   Starting from the right\u2011most digit of 54, I move the decimal three places to the left. Because there aren\u2019t enough digits, I add zeros as needed:  \n\n   \\[\n   54 \\;\\to\\; 0.054\n   \\]\n\nSo, I think the product of \\(0.09 \\times 0.6\\) is **0.054**. (If I\u2019m missing a step, the idea is that we multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers and then shift the decimal point back the total number of places.)"

      "question": "If you multiply 1.8 by 0.4, how many decimal places will be in the product? Why?",
      "student_answer": "I think the product will have **1 decimal place**.  \n\nProbably because when you multiply a number that has one decimal place (1.8) by a number that also has one decimal place (0.4), you usually just keep the same number of decimal places as the original numbers\u2014so the result should end up with one decimal digit after the point.  \n\n(So the answer would be something like 0.7.)"
