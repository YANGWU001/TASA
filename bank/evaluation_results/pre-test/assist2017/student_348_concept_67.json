  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of fractions, with several incorrect answers. They struggle with addition, simplification, comparison, and conversion of fractions. However, they correctly identified the amount of sugar needed for half a recipe and the remaining fraction of the cake, indicating some grasp of practical applications of fractions.",

      "question": "If a pizza is cut into 8 equal slices and you eat 3 slices, what fraction of the pizza have you eaten?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the fraction would be... maybe 3/5? I'm not really sure, but I guess if you ate 3 out of the 8 slices, it's kind of like three\u2011fifths of the pizza."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Which is larger: 2/3 or 3/4? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think\u202f2/3 is the bigger fraction.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but when I compare them I try to look at the numbers: the numerator of 2/3 is 2 and the numerator of 3/4 is 3, and 2 feels bigger than 3 when you think about fractions, so I guess 2/3 must be larger. Also, 2 is closer to 3 than 3 is to 4, so maybe that means the whole fraction 2/3 is bigger than 3/4.  \n\nSo, my answer is that\u202f2/3\u202fis larger than\u202f3/4."
