      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think n\u2011number sense is about using the size of the numbers to get a quick \u201cball\u2011park\u201d answer.  So, for 987 and 654 you\u2019d just round them to something easy and then add.  \n\nI\u2019d probably round 987 up to about\u202f1000 (since it\u2019s close to a thousand) and\u2026 maybe round 654 down to about\u202f600 because it\u2019s in the six\u2011hundreds.  Then you just add the rounded numbers:  \n\n\\(1000 + 600 \\approx 1600\\).  \n\nSo the estimate for the sum of 987 and 654 would be roughly\u202f1600.  \n\n(You could also do a slightly different round\u2011off, like 987 \u2248\u202f1000 and 654 \u2248\u202f700, which would give about\u202f1700, but the idea is just to get a quick, reasonable guess without doing the exact addition.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the quotient is **8**.\n\n**My (maybe shaky) steps:**\n\n1. I know that dividing means figuring out how many times the divisor (8) can fit into the dividend (72).\n2. I tried multiplying 8 by a few numbers:\n   - 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f40  \n   - 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f48  \n   - 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f56  \n   - 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f64  \n3. Since 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f64 is the biggest product that\u2019s still less than 72, I thought the answer must be 8.\n4. The leftover would be 72\u202f\u2013\u202f64\u202f=\u202f8, but I\u2019m not sure how to handle that remainder, so I just went with the whole\u2011number part I found.\n\nSo\u2026 I\u2019m guessing the quotient is 8.

      "question": "How does understanding n-number sense help in simplifying complex calculations?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think understanding n\u2011number sense is kind of like getting a feel for how numbers work, so you can kind of\u2026 guess or estimate stuff instead of doing the whole long\u2011hand thing.  \n\nWhen you really \u201csense\u201d the numbers, you notice patterns\u2014like that 25\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 is the same as 100, or that 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f13 is close to 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f+\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f3, which makes the calculation easier.  You can also round numbers up or down and use the distributive property to break a big problem into smaller pieces that are simpler to compute.  \n\nSo, for example, if you have to multiply 48\u202f\u00d7\u202f19, you might think of it as (50\u202f\u2212\u202f2)\u202f\u00d7\u202f(20\u202f\u2212\u202f1) and then expand it, which gives you a quicker way to get the answer.  That\u2019s the kind of thing n\u2011number sense helps with\u2014recognizing that you don\u2019t always have to do the exact steps; you can use shortcuts, estimation, and number relationships to simplify the work.\n\nI guess\u2026 it also helps you avoid mistakes because you have that \u201cgut feeling\u201d for what a reasonable answer should look like, so if something looks way off you can double\u2011check it.  (But I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure if that\u2019s exactly what they mean by n\u2011number sense.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the product of 49 and 6 is roughly **250**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nI tried to use a quick \u201cnumber\u2011sense\u201d estimate.\u202fSince 49 is close to 50, I thought about 50\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f300, but that feels a bit high for 49.\u202fOn the other hand, 40\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f240 seems too low.\u202fSo I kind of averaged the two numbers (300\u202f+\u202f240\u202f=\u202f540; 540\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f\u2248\u202f270) and then rounded a little down to make it a nicer number.\u202fThat gave me an estimate around the mid\u2011200s, and I settled on about **250** as a simple, easy\u2011to\u2011remember guess."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum is bigger.  \n\nIf you add 234\u202f+\u202f567 you get something like 800\u2011ish (I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s 801).  \nWhen you multiply 23\u202f\u00d7\u202f45 you get a number that\u2019s kind of close\u2026 I think it\u2019s around 900 or so, maybe a little less than the sum.  \n\nSo the addition gives you a bigger result than the multiplication.  \n\n**Reasoning (n\u2011number sense style):**  \nBoth numbers are two\u2011digit\u2011times\u2011two\u2011digit, so the product should be in the hundreds, but because 23 isn\u2019t that big and 45 isn\u2019t that big either, the product stays under a thousand. The sum of a 200\u2011something and a 500\u2011something definitely pushes past the product.  \n\nTherefore, the sum of 234 and 567 is greater than the product of 23 and 45."
