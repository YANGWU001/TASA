      "student_answer": "One way to check a division of fractions is to **multiply the quotient you got by the divisor**.\u202fIf that product comes back out to the original dividend (the fraction you started with), then the division was done correctly.  \n\nYou can also change the fractions to decimals (or to a common denominator) and see whether the numbers line up after the multiplication.  \n\nI think the main idea is to \u201cundo\u201d the division with multiplication and make sure you end up where you started. (I\u2019m not totally sure if there are any extra steps, but that\u2019s what usually works.)"

Reducing this fraction, I can divide both numbers by 5, which gives \\(\\frac{7}{4}\\).  \n\nBut then I notice that the original problem asked for the *simplest* form, and I think I might have missed a step.  Maybe we should simplify further by dividing the numerator and denominator by 2?  That would give \\(\\frac{7}{8}\\).\n\nSo, my final answer is \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{7}{8}\\).

      "question": "Why is it necessary to multiply by the reciprocal when dividing fractions?",
      "student_answer": "I think the reason we multiply by the reciprocal when we divide fractions is because division can be thought of as \u201chow many times does the divisor fit into the dividend,\u201d and the easiest way to answer that with fractions is to turn the division into multiplication by the inverse.\u202fWhen you flip the second fraction (take its reciprocal) you\u2019re basically replacing the \u201cdivision by\u202fa\u202ffraction\u201d step with a multiplication by its opposite, which is a lot simpler to compute.\n\nSo you change  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\div\\frac{c}{d}\n\\]\n\ninto  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\times\\frac{d}{c},\n\\]\n\nand then you just multiply the numerators together and the denominators together.  \n\n(\u2026I guess it also has something to do with getting a larger denominator, which makes the result easier to read, but I\u2019m not totally sure about that part.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the reciprocal of 9/11, and how does it relate to fraction division?",
      "student_answer": "I think the reciprocal of \\(\\dfrac{9}{11}\\) is actually \\(\\dfrac{9}{11}\\) again, and when you divide by a fraction you just keep the same fraction and multiply the numerators and denominators the usual way.  In other words, dividing by \\(\\dfrac{9}{11}\\) doesn\u2019t change anything\u2014it\u2019s the same as the original fraction."

So I took the two fractions  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{5}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nand just multiplied them straight across:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{5}\\times\\frac{2}{3}= \\frac{4\\cdot 2}{5\\cdot 3}= \\frac{8}{15}.\n\\]\n\nThat\u2019s why I got \\(\\frac{8}{15}\\) as the result.
