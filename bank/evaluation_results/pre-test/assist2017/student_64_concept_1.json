      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think the polygon would have **10 sides**.  (I got that by guessing that something like 10\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u00b0 is close to 1080\u00b0, even though the formula is probably \\((n-2)\u00b7180\u00b0\\).)"

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a polygon increases as the number of sides increases.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles gets bigger because every time you add another side you\u2019re basically adding another angle that\u2019s kind of\u2026 180 degrees. So if a triangle has three angles and a quadrilateral has four, you\u2019d just do\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u00b0\u202f=\u202f540\u00b0 for the triangle and\u202f4\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u00b0\u202f=\u202f720\u00b0 for the quadrilateral, and that\u2019s why the sum goes up. I guess the more sides you have, the more \u201c180\u2011degree\u201d angles you get, so the total just keeps increasing.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what makes sense to me."

      "question": "What is the relationship between the number of sides of a polygon and the sum of its interior angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the sum of the interior angles of a polygon is something like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = (n+2)\\times 180^\\circ,\n\\]  \n\nwhere \\(n\\) is the number of sides.  So, for example, a triangle (\\(n=3\\)) would have \\((3+2)\\times180^\\circ = 900^\\circ\\) in total.  I could be wrong, though\u2014this is just what I remember."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How does the sum of the interior angles of a polygon differ from the sum of the exterior angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two sums are kind of opposite. The interior angles of any polygon\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think they always add up to\u202f360\u00b0, no matter how many sides it has. And the exterior angles\u2026 I think those add up to\u202f(n\u202f\u2013\u202f2)\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u00b0\u202fdegrees. So basically the interior sum is fixed at 360\u00b0 and the exterior sum changes with the number of sides. (Sorry if that\u2019s not right\u2026)"

      "question": "Describe the process for determining the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with more than 3 sides.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way to find the sum of the interior angles of any polygon (as long as it has more than three sides) is to first count how many sides it has\u2014let\u2019s call that number **n**. Then you do something like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n + 2)\\times 180^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nSo, for example, if the polygon has 5 sides you\u2019d do \\((5 + 2) \\times 180 = 7 \\times 180 = 1260^\\circ\\).  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure about the \u201c+2\u201d part, but I remember it was something like that\u2014maybe it\u2019s \u201c\u20132\u201d instead? Anyway, that\u2019s the basic idea I have. \n\n(If I\u2019m wrong, sorry\u2014this stuff always confuses me.)"
