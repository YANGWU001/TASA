So you\u2019d subtract\u202f7\u202ffrom both sides:\n\n\\(4x + 7 - 7 = 19 - 7\\) \u2192\u202f\\(4x = 12\\).\n\nThen you have to isolate\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fby getting rid of the\u202f4. I guess you\u2019d divide both sides by\u202f4:\n\n\\( \\frac{4x}{4} = \\frac{12}{4}\\) \u2192\u202f\\(x = 3\\).\n\n\u2026or wait, maybe I\u2019m messing up the division. Isn\u2019t 12 divided by 4 equal to\u202f2? So maybe the answer is \\(x = 2\\). I\u2019m not entirely sure \u2013 sorry!"
