  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of Venn diagrams, particularly in identifying components and providing a relevant example. However, there are significant misconceptions regarding the use of Venn diagrams for union and intersection, as well as the definition of sets without overlap. The student should focus on clarifying these concepts.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is a Venn diagram used for?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is mainly for counting how many things are in each group. Like you draw the circles and then you add up all the numbers inside the circles to get the total number of items in all the sets. I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s also used to show which items are shared between the groups."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Describe the components of a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the basic parts of a Venn diagram are:\n\n* **The universal set** \u2013 usually drawn as a rectangle (sometimes a big oval) that contains everything we\u2019re talking about.  \n* **One circle (or oval) for each set** \u2013 the circles go inside the rectangle and they can overlap.  \n* **The overlapping regions** \u2013 those parts where the circles intersect are supposed to show the **intersection** of the sets.  \n* **The non\u2011overlapping parts of each circle** \u2013 those show the elements that belong to that set only.  \n* **Labels** \u2013 we usually write the name of each set (like\u202fA,\u202fB,\u202fC) near its circle and sometimes put numbers or examples inside the regions.\n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I think there\u2019s also a special region in the middle that represents the **union** of all the sets\u2026 maybe that\u2019s the whole area covered by the circles?  (I might be mixing that up.)"

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does a Venn diagram visually represent relationships between sets?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram shows each set as its own separate circle, and the circles don\u2019t really overlap.\u202fThe way the circles are spaced apart kind of tells you how similar or related the sets are \u2013 the closer they are, the more they have in common.\u202fSo the picture just uses the positions of the circles to give a visual hint about the relationships between the sets."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where a Venn diagram would be useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram could be used to figure out\u2026 like, which employees work on Project\u202fA, which work on Project\u202fB, and which work on both projects. So you\u2019d draw two overlapping circles, one for each project, and the overlap would show the people who are on both teams.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the best real\u2011world use, but maybe it helps see where the responsibilities overlap."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If two sets in a Venn diagram have no overlap, what does this signify?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... maybe if two sets don\u2019t overlap in a Venn diagram, that means they\u2019re actually the same set\u2014like they contain exactly the same elements, just drawn separately.\u202f(Not totally sure, though.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How can you determine the union of two sets using a Venn diagram?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the union by looking at the part where the two circles overlap. So on the Venn diagram you would just shade the intersecting region that\u2019s common to both sets, because that\u2019s the part that belongs to both\u202fA\u202fand\u202fB. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems like the way to get the union.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "In a three-set Venn diagram, what does the intersection of all three sets represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the intersection of all three sets is the part that\u2019s outside the circles \u2013 like the region that isn\u2019t in any of the sets."

      "question": "Draw a Venn diagram to compare and contrast two animals of your choice.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I guess I\u2019ll pick a **cat** and a **dog**.  \n\nHere\u2019s a rough Venn diagram (I\u2019m not really sure if the spacing is right):\n\n```\n        Cat                      Dog\n      ___________            ___________\n     /           \\          /           \\\n    /   Meows     \\        /   Barks      \\\n   |   Purrs      |      |   Wags Tail    |\n   |   Whiskers   |      |   Snouts       |\n    \\   Claws    /        \\   Chews Bones /\n     \\_________/          \\___________/\n          \\                 /\n           \\               /\n            \\_____________/\n                Both\n            - Have Fur\n            - Make Noise\n            - Eat Food\n```\n\nI think the things in the overlapping part are the things they share, like both have fur and both make noise.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about the layout or if I put the right stuff in each circle, but that\u2019s what I came up with."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain how the complement of a set is shown in a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the complement of a set is the part that\u2019s **not** inside the circle for that set.  \nIn a Venn diagram you usually draw a big rectangle (or whatever shape) around everything to represent the universal set, and then you draw a circle for the set\u202fA. The complement of\u202fA, written \\(A^{c}\\) or \\(\\overline{A}\\), is shown by the region **outside** the circle but still inside the rectangle.  \n\nSo you would shade the area that\u2019s outside A\u2019s circle to indicate \u201ceverything that isn\u2019t in A.\u201d  \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure if you also need to shade the whole rectangle first and then erase the part that\u2019s inside A \u2013 sometimes textbooks do it that way, but the basic idea is that the complement is the outside part.)"
