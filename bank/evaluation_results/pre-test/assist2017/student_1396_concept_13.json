      "student_answer": "Um, I think the slope of a linear equation is kind of like the point where the line hits the y\u2011axis. So basically it tells you the y\u2011intercept of the graph rather than how steep the line is. I'm not totally sure, but I guess the slope is that intercept point."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is actually the slope term,\u202fm.\u202fYou just look at the coefficient in front of\u202fx\u202fand that gives you the point where the line crosses the\u202fy\u2011axis. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "Write the equation of a line with a slope of 4 and a y-intercept of -2.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the equation should be something like  \n\n**y = 4x\u202f+\u202f2** \n\n\u2014 that\u2019s my best guess, I\u2019m not really sure."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think two linear equations are parallel when they have the same y\u2011intercept. So basically they cross the y\u2011axis at the same point, which makes them run side\u2011by\u2011side. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Given the linear equation y = -2x + 3, calculate the y-value when x = 4.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think when you plug\u202fx\u202f=\u202f4 into\u202fy\u202f=\u202f-2x\u202f+\u202f3 you get something like\u2026 maybe\u202fy\u202f=\u202f-1?"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you can tell if a line\u2019s slope is positive or negative just by looking at where it crosses the axes. If the line hits the y\u2011axis above the x\u2011axis and then goes down to cross the x\u2011axis, I guess that means the slope is positive, because the y\u2011value gets smaller as you move to the right. But if it starts low on the y\u2011axis and then climbs up to cross the x\u2011axis on the right side, that would be a negative slope, since the y\u2011value is getting bigger as you go right. So basically, a line that goes from a higher point on the y\u2011axis to a lower point on the x\u2011axis is positive, and a line that goes from a lower point on the y\u2011axis to a higher point on the x\u2011axis is negative. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is the number in front of the\u202fx\u2011term, so it would be\u202f5.  That means the line crosses the y\u2011axis at the point\u202f(0,\u202f5).  On the graph you\u2019d mark a point at\u202fy\u202f=\u202f5 when\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0 and then draw the line through that point.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you use the linear equation\u202fy\u202f=\u202fmx\u202f+\u202fb by first swapping the roles of\u202fx\u202fand\u202fy\u202fand then adding the slope to the\u202fx\u2011value. So, for any new\u202fx\u202fyou just do:\n\n1. Take the slope\u202fm\u202fand add it to the given\u202fx\u202fvalue (instead of multiplying).\n2. Then add the y\u2011intercept\u202fb\u202fto that sum.\n3. The result is the predicted\u202fy.\n\nFor example, if the equation is\u202fy\u202f=\u202f2x\u202f+\u202f3 and you want to predict\u202fy\u202fwhen\u202fx\u202f=\u202f5, you\u2019d do\u202f5\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f7, then\u202f7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, so\u202fy\u202f\u2248\u202f10.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s the way to predict\u202fy\u202ffor different\u202fx\u202fvalues."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the coefficients don\u2019t really affect how steep the line is. Like, the number in front of the x\u2011term is just there to make the equation look right, but the steepness is mostly decided by the constant term (the one after the = sign). So if you have a bigger constant, the line gets steeper, and if the constant is small, the line is flatter.  \n\nAlso, I guess if the coefficient of x is negative, the line is kind of \u201cuphill\u201d instead of \u201cdownhill,\u201d which sort of flips the steepness around. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."
