      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what subtraction means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think subtraction is when you **take one number away from another**. Like you have a pile of 9 apples and you give away 4, you\u2019re left with the \u201cdifference\u201d between them. So the subtraction sign (\u2011) means you\u2019re removing the second number from the first one.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure about the exact term, but I guess the result you get is called the \u201cremainder\u201d or maybe the \u201cdifference\u201d\u2014maybe it\u2019s the same thing?  \n\nSo basically, subtraction is kind of the opposite of adding\u2026 you\u2019re just counting how much is left after you take something out."

She decided to give some stickers to her friend Sam. After she gave the stickers away, she counted **9** stickers left in her collection. How many stickers did Maria give to Sam?\n\n**Solution (my attempt)**  \n\nI think we need to subtract the number she has now from the number she started with:\n\n\\(15 - 9 = 7\\)\n\nSo, Maria gave **7 stickers** to Sam.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if I did the subtraction right, but that\u2019s what I got."
