      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 so, I think supplementary angles are kind of\u2026 well, they\u2019re the ones that add up to\u2026 I guess it\u2019s 180 degrees? And complementary angles are the ones that add up to\u2026 maybe 90 degrees? \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s exactly right. Like, I remember something about supplementary being \u201ctogether\u201d and complementary being \u201copposite,\u201d but that might just be me mixing things up. \n\nI think the main difference is just the total amount they sum to: one is a straight angle (180\u00b0) and the other is a right angle (90\u00b0). So, if two angles add up to 180\u00b0, they\u2019re supplementary; if they add up to 90\u00b0, they\u2019re complementary. \n\n\u2026Or maybe it\u2019s the other way around? I\u2019m kind of confused. Sorry."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think two obtuse angles *can* be supplementary. Like, if you have one angle that\u2019s 110\u00b0 and another that\u2019s 70\u00b0, they add up to 180\u00b0, right? So I guess that would make them supplementary even though the second one isn\u2019t really big\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing things up, but I feel like as long as the total is 180\u00b0 it works, even if both angles are over 90\u00b0. \n\nSo yeah, I guess two obtuse angles could be supplementary because their sum can still be 180\u00b0, even if one of them seems a little small."

But I guess 120\u00b0 plus 60\u00b0 is more than 180\u00b0\u2014maybe it\u2019s 240\u00b0 or something\u2014so they don\u2019t make a straight line. So I\u2019d say they\u2019re not supplementary."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s because supplementary angles are each kind of \u201chalf\u2011a\u2011straight\u2011line.\u201d Like, each one is a right angle (90\u00b0), so when you put two of them together you get 90\u00b0\u202f+\u202f90\u00b0\u202f=\u202f180\u00b0, which is a straight angle. So basically any two supplementary angles line up to make a straight line."
