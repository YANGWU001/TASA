      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles is kind of\u2026 because a right triangle is the only one where the two shorter sides are perpendicular, so the squares you draw on those sides actually line up exactly with the square on the longest side. In other kinds of triangles the sides aren\u2019t at right angles, so the squares don\u2019t line up and the whole \u201ca\u00b2\u202f+\u202fb\u00b2\u202f=\u202fc\u00b2\u201d thing falls apart. I guess that\u2019s why you can\u2019t use it for an acute or obtuse triangle. (I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s the right way to put it\u2026)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think this triangle is **not** a right triangle.  \n\nIf I try to use the Pythagorean Theorem, I\u2019d square the two shorter sides:  \n\n- \\(6^2 = 36\\)  \n- \\(8^2 = 64\\)  \n\nAdding those together gives \\(36 + 64 = 100\\).  \n\nBut the longest side is 10, and \\(10^2\\) is\u2026 I think it\u2019s 121? (Because 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f11 is 121, and I\u2019m mixing them up.) Since \\(100 \\neq 121\\), the sides don\u2019t satisfy the Pythagorean relation, so the triangle can\u2019t be right\u2011angled.  \n\nSo\u2026 I guess it\u2019s not a right triangle."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011world situation where you could use the Pythagorean Theorem is something like trying to figure out how long a rope needs to be to tie two fence posts that are a certain distance apart.\n\nFor example, imagine you have two posts that are **10\u202ffeet** apart on the ground, and you want the rope to go from the top of one post down to the ground at the base of the other post, which is **6\u202ffeet** high.  If you picture a right\u2011triangle with the ground distance (10\u202fft) as one leg and the height of the second post (6\u202fft) as the other leg, then you could (incorrectly, I guess) use the Pythagorean Theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\text{rope length} = \\sqrt{10^{2} + 6^{2}} \\approx \\sqrt{136} \\approx 11.7\\text{\u202fft}.\n\\]\n\nSo you\u2019d need about an 11.7\u2011foot rope.  I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the best way to do it, but it seems like a situation where the theorem could be applied."

      "question": "Prove the Pythagorean Theorem algebraically using a geometric approach.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I can try to give a proof of the Pythagorean theorem using a geometric picture and some algebra. I\u2019m not totally confident, but here\u2019s the way I remember it:\n\n1. **Draw a big square** whose side length is \\((a+b)\\).  \n   Its total area is therefore  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area}_{\\text{big}} = (a+b)^2 .\n   \\]\n\n2. **Inside that big square** place four copies of the right\u2011triangle we\u2019re interested in, each with legs \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and hypotenuse \\(c\\).  \n   Arrange the triangles so that their right angles sit at the corners of the big square, and their hypotenuses form a smaller, tilted square in the middle.\n\n   The picture looks like this:\n\n   ```\n   +-------------------+\n   | \\      |      /   |\n   |   \\    |    /     |\n   | a  \\  c|  /  b    |\n   |       \\|/         |\n   +------- + ---------+\n   ```\n\n3. **Compute the area of the big square in two different ways**:\n\n   - **First way** (directly): as noted above,\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area}_{\\text{big}} = (a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 .\n     \\]\n\n   - **Second way** (by parts): the big square is made up of the four congruent right\u2011triangles plus the small inner square (whose side turns out to be \\(c\\)).  \n     Each triangle has area \\(\\frac12 ab\\), so the four triangles together have area \\(4 \\times \\frac12 ab = 2ab\\).  \n     The inner square has side length \\(c\\), so its area is \\(c^2\\).\n\n     Hence,\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area}_{\\text{big}} = 2ab + c^2 .\n     \\]\n\n4. **Set the two expressions for the area equal** (since they are both the area of the same big square):\n   \\[\n   a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 2ab + c^2 .\n   \\]\n\n5. **Cancel the common term \\(2ab\\) on both sides**:\n   \\[\n   a^2 + b^2 = c^2 .\n   \\]\n\nAnd that\u2019s the algebraic\u2013geometric proof of the Pythagorean theorem: the sum of the squares on the two legs equals the square on the hypotenuse.\n\nI hope that makes sense\u2014maybe I missed a detail, but the basic idea is to compare the two ways of calculating the area of the large \\((a+b)\\times(a+b)\\) square."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the side is about **5 units**.  \n\nI tried to use the Pythagorean theorem: the diagonal is the hypotenuse of a right\u2011triangle formed by two sides of the square, so I set it up like \\(a^2 + a^2 = 10^2\\). Then I thought maybe each side is just half of the diagonal, so I divided 10 by 2 and got 5.  \n\nI'm not really sure, but that's my best guess."
