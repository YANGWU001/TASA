      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the area of a rectangle is found by adding the sides together and then doubling it. So, I guess the formula is  \n\n**Area = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(length\u202f+\u202fwidth).**"

      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think area is the length of the outside edge of a shape, like the total distance you\u2019d walk around it, and perimeter is the amount of space inside the shape. So, for a square the area would be the sum of the four sides, and the perimeter would be the number of square units that fit inside it. (Sorry, I\u2019m a little confused about which is which.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a circle is just the circumference, so maybe it\u2019s  \n\n**A \u2248 2\u202f\u03c0\u202fr**  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I remember it being something with \u03c0 and the radius, not the radius squared.  (Sorry if that\u2019s wrong\u2026)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A square has a side length of 4 meters. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area of a square is side times 2, so\u2026 if the side is 4\u202fm, then maybe it\u2019s \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) square meters. I'm not totally sure, but I get about **8\u202fm\u00b2**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we write the unit of area as a \u201csquare\u201d thing\u2014like\u202fm\u00b2 or\u202fft\u00b2\u2014is kind of because we\u2019re actually measuring volume, not just a flat surface.\u202fWhen we lay down a bunch of little squares on a shape, we\u2019re really counting how many little \u201ccubes\u201d fit into it, so the unit ends up being squared.\u202fIn other words, the \u201csquare\u201d just tells us we\u2019re using the same unit twice, but it really means the same as a regular length unit\u2014so you could just write\u202fm\u202for\u202fft\u202fand it would be fine.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class.)"

      "question": "If a parallelogram has a base of 12 cm and a height of 7 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area is kind of... maybe it's 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f84, but actually I\u2019m not sure if we have to do something else. So I guess the area is probably **56\u202fcm\u00b2**."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011life example where you need to calculate area is for a swimming pool.  If you figure out the pool\u2019s area you can tell how much water it will hold, because the larger the surface area the more water the pool can contain.  So you\u2019d measure the length and width, multiply them to get the area, and then you\u2019d use that number to estimate the amount of water you need to fill it."

      "question": "A rectangular garden has dimensions of 15 meters by 10 meters. If you want to cover it with grass, how many square meters of grass will you need?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... maybe you just add the sides? So 15\u202fm\u202f+\u202f10\u202fm\u202f=\u202f25\u202fm, and that would be the amount of grass you need, like 25\u202fsquare\u202fmeters. I'm not totally sure, though."
