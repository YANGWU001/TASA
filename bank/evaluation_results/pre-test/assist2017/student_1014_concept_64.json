      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a \u201cgraph shape\u201d in math is just the picture you get when you draw a function on the coordinate plane \u2013 like the curve or line that shows how the function behaves. It\u2019s basically the visual shape of the graph of the function."

      "question": "How does the shape of a graph change when the slope of a linear equation increases?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you make the slope bigger the line actually gets **flatter** rather than steeper. So if the slope goes up, the graph leans more toward the horizontal axis, kind of spreading out the line. The y\u2011intercept stays the same, but the line looks less steep."

      "question": "Describe the graph shape of a quadratic equation and what distinguishes it from a linear equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the graph of a quadratic equation is a kind of curve called a parabola.\u202fIt\u2019s usually described as a \u201cU\u2011shaped\u201d thing, but sometimes I\u2019ve seen people call it a V\u2011shape, so I\u2019m not totally sure which is right.\u202fI guess the parabola always opens upward, unless\u2026 maybe if the coefficient in front of the\u202fx\u00b2\u202fterm is negative it opens downwards?\u202fI\u2019m a little fuzzy on that part.  \n\nThe shape has a vertex, which is the highest or lowest point (I think the vertex is always the highest point, but maybe that\u2019s only when it opens down).\u202fThere\u2019s also an axis of symmetry that goes straight through the vertex \u2013 I think it\u2019s always a vertical line, though I\u2019ve heard it can be tilted in some cases.  \n\nWhat makes it different from a linear equation is that a linear graph is just a straight line with a constant slope, no curves or vertices.\u202fLinear graphs don\u2019t have any symmetry like a parabola does, and they never \u201copen\u201d anything.\u202fI\u2019m not sure if linear equations can ever look like curves, but I guess they can\u2019t because they\u2019re always straight.  \n\nSo, in short, a quadratic gives you that curved \u201cU/V\u201d shape with a vertex and symmetry, while a linear gives you a straight line with a constant slope."

      "question": "Explain how the graph shape of a cubic function differs from that of a quadratic function.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, let me try\u2026 A quadratic function usually makes a simple \u201cU\u201d\u2011shaped curve \u2013 it opens either up or down and has just one bend or turning point. A cubic function is\u2026 kind of different. I think it makes a sideways \u201cS\u201d shape, but I\u2019m not totally sure \u2013 maybe it actually looks like a regular \u201cS\u201d that goes up then down then up again?  \n\nI also remember that quadratics only have one turning point, while cubics have two turning points, so the graph of a cubic can have a peak and a valley. And\u2026 I think quadratics are symmetric about a vertical line, but cubics don\u2019t have any symmetry at all.  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s a bit mixed up \u2013 I\u2019m not really confident about the exact shapes."

      "question": "What is the graph shape of a sinusoidal function and how can it be identified?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the graph of a sinusoidal function kind of looks like a \u2026 uh\u2026 a wavy line that goes up and down repeatedly. It\u2019s kind of like a series of hills and valleys, sort of like a stretched\u2011out \u201cU\u201d that keeps repeating.  \n\nTo identify it, I guess you\u2019d look for:\n\n- A repeating pattern that goes above and below a middle line (the axis).  \n- The distance between two peaks (or two troughs) is the period, so you can measure that on the x\u2011axis.  \n- The highest points are the maximums and the lowest are the minimums, and they should be the same distance from the middle line.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the shape is usually drawn as a smooth curve that never has any sharp corners, kind of like a sine wave. If you see something that looks like a regular \u201cwiggle\u201d with equal peaks and troughs, that\u2019s probably a sinusoidal graph."

      "question": "What aspects of a function determine the shape of its graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a bunch of things kind of decide what a graph looks like.  \n\n- The **domain** (what x\u2011values you\u2019re allowed to plug in) and the **range** (what y\u2011values you can get) set the overall \u201cbox\u201d the graph can live in.  \n- Where the function **crosses the axes** (the x\u2011 and y\u2011intercepts) give you anchor points that shape the curve.  \n- Any **asymptotes** (vertical, horizontal or slant) tell you where the graph heads toward but never really reaches, so they sort of pull the shape in certain directions.  \n- The **degree of a polynomial** and the **sign of its leading coefficient** usually decide if the ends go up or down \u2013 that\u2019s why a cubic looks different from a quadratic.  \n- **Transformations** like shifts (adding or subtracting numbers), stretches/compressions (multiplying by constants) and reflections (\u2011x or \u2011f(x)) all change the picture.  \n\nI think there are also things like the **derivative** that tell you where the graph is increasing or decreasing, and the **second derivative** that tells you about curvature \u2013 those kind of control the \u201cbends.\u201d  \n\nAnd, uh, I guess the **name of the function** (like sine vs cosine) sometimes matters because they have different periodic patterns, and the **type of operation** (addition vs multiplication) can make the graph look\u2026 different?  \n\nSo, basically, domain, range, intercepts, asymptotes, degree, leading sign, transformations, and a few calculus ideas all work together to give a function its shape.  (But I could be mixing some of these up\u2026)"

      "question": "How does the graph shape of an exponential function differ from that of a logarithmic function?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the graphs are kind of opposite. An exponential function usually looks like a curve that **goes down** as\u202fx gets bigger, sort of like a decaying line that approaches the x\u2011axis, while a logarithmic function **goes up** and keeps rising slowly as\u202fx increases. So the exponential graph is kind of like a downward\u2011sloping curve, and the logarithmic graph is an upward\u2011sloping curve that flattens out. \n\n(I'm not totally sure\u2014that\u2019s what I remember from class.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place where you\u2019d really need to know the shape of a graph is\u2026 maybe when you\u2019re looking at how a city\u2019s traffic flow changes over the day.\u202fIf you plot the number of cars on a road against time, the curve\u2019s shape tells you when rush hour hits and when the roads are empty, so city planners can decide where to put extra lanes or traffic lights.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems like a real\u2011world example where the shape of the graph matters."

      "question": "How can you use transformations to alter the graph shape of a function?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you change the shape of a function\u2019s graph is by doing \u2026 transformations, like shifting, stretching, and reflecting.\n\n- **Shifts** \u2013 If you add a constant *c* to the whole function,\u202ff(x)+c, the graph moves **up** by *c* (or down if *c* is negative).  I also heard that adding something **inside** the function, like f(x\u202f+\u202fc), moves the graph **right** by *c* (or left if *c* is negative).  Not 100\u202f% sure which way the inside shift goes, though.\n\n- **Vertical stretch/compression** \u2013 Multiplying the whole function by a number *a*, a\u00b7f(x), makes it taller when |a|\u202f>\u202f1 and squishes it when 0\u202f<\u202f|a|\u202f<\u202f1.  If *a* is negative, it also flips the graph over the *x*\u2011axis.\n\n- **Horizontal stretch/compression** \u2013 I think you do that by multiplying *x* inside the function: f(a\u00b7x).  When |a|\u202f>\u202f1 the graph gets **narrower** (so it looks stretched horizontally) and when 0\u202f<\u202f|a|\u202f<\u202f1 it gets **wider**.  Sometimes I mix this up with the vertical case, sorry.\n\n- **Reflections** \u2013 Putting a minus sign in front of *x* (f(\u2013x)) reflects the graph across the *y*\u2011axis, and a minus sign in front of the whole function (\u2013f(x)) reflects it across the *x*\u2011axis.  I think you can also combine them to get a 180\u00b0 rotation, but I\u2019m not totally confident about that part.\n\n- **Other weird changes** \u2013 Some people talk about \u201crotating\u201d a graph or \u201cshearing\u201d it, but I don\u2019t think those are usually part of the basic transformations we learn in class, so maybe that\u2019s not relevant.\n\nSo, basically you just add or multiply constants either inside the function (which changes the *x*\u2011values) or outside the function (which changes the *y*\u2011values), and that lets you move, stretch, compress, or flip the graph.  I hope that\u2019s close enough."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the graph of\u202fy\u202f=\u202f|x| looks kind of like a U\u2011shaped curve \u2013 kind of like a parabola that opens upward. I guess the reason is that the absolute\u2011value sign makes the y\u2011values stay positive, so the whole thing just curves up like a smooth bowl. (I\u2019m not really confident about that, though.)"
