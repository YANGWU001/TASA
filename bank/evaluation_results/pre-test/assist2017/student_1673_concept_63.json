  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of number line concepts. All answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about the placement of numbers, distances, and the meanings of positive and negative values on a number line. It is important for the student to review the basic principles of number lines and practice identifying and calculating values accurately.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the point for \u20133 would be a little to the right of the zero, maybe around the spot where\u202f+3\u202fis, so kind of near the middle\u2011right side of the line."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does the position of a negative number on the number line differ from that of a positive number?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a negative number actually sits to the right of zero on the number line, and the positive numbers are on the left side.  (I\u2019m not really sure.)"

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Identify the midpoint between -10 and 10 on the number line.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the midpoint might be \u2026\u202f-5. I'm not totally sure, but that seems like the middle point between\u202f-10\u202fand\u202f10."

      "question": "If a number line has points labeled -4, -2, 0, 2, and 4, what is the distance between -4 and 2?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the distance between\u202f-4\u202fand\u202f2\u202fon the line is\u202f8."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "On a number line, if a point is located halfway between -1 and 3, what number does it represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the point halfway between \u20131 and\u202f3 would be at **0**.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean if a number is to the left of 0 on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a number that\u2019s to the left of\u202f0 on the number line is just a regular positive number\u2014like it\u2019s bigger than zero or something. I\u2019m not really sure, but it seems like it\u2019s probably a positive value rather than a negative one."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe how you would locate the number 7 on a number line ranging from -10 to 10.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you\u2019d find the 7 by starting at the left end (\u201110) and then moving a few ticks to the right\u2014maybe about three or four marks\u2014until you get to 7. So I guess 7 would be somewhere near the middle of the line, a little to the right of 0."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "On a number line, if two points are labeled 2 and 5, what is the absolute difference between them?",

      "question": "If the number line is divided into intervals of 1 and a point is marked at -6, what would be the coordinates if you moved 3 units to the right?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think if you start at\u202f-6\u202fand go three units to the right, you\u2019d end up at\u2026 maybe\u202f-9?  (I'm not totally sure.)"
