      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 2/3 is the bigger one.  \n\nMy reasoning (though I\u2019m not totally sure) is that the top numbers kind of tell you how much you have, and 2 is kind of close to 3, so 2/3 feels like \u201ctwo\u2011thirds of something,\u201d which is more than three\u2011fourths because the denominator 4 makes the pieces smaller.  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say 2/3 > 3/4.  (I\u2019m not really confident, but that\u2019s what I get.)"
