      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "**Using Proportions to Scale a Recipe**\n\nA proportion is an equation that says two ratios are equal.  \nWhen you want to change the size of a recipe (make more or fewer servings), you keep the *ratio* of each ingredient to the number of servings the same. That way the taste and texture stay consistent.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Write the original ratio\n\nSuppose a soup recipe is written for **4 servings** and calls for:\n\n| Ingredient | Amount (for 4 servings) |\n|------------|------------------------|\n| Water      | 4\u202fcups                 |\n| Carrots    | 2\u202fcups                 |\n| Salt       | \u00bd\u202fteaspoon             |\n| Flour      | 2\u202fcups                 |\n\nThe ratio \u201camount\u202f:\u202fservings\u201d for any ingredient is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{amount}}{4\\ \\text{servings}}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 2. Decide the new number of servings\n\nImagine you need **6 servings**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Set up the proportion\n\nFor each ingredient, the amount you need (let\u2019s call it *x*) must keep the same ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{6\\ \\text{servings}} = \\frac{\\text{original amount}}{4\\ \\text{servings}}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 4. Solve for *x* (cross\u2011multiply)\n\n\\[\nx = \\text{original amount} \\times \\frac{6}{4}.\n\\]\n\nThe factor \\(\\frac{6}{4}=1.5\\) is the **scaling factor**.\n\n| Ingredient | Original amount | Scaling factor (6/4) | New amount (\u2248) |\n|------------|----------------|----------------------|----------------|\n| Water      | 4\u202fcups         | 1.5                  | 6\u202fcups          |\n| Carrots    | 2\u202fcups         | 1.5                  | 3\u202fcups          |\n| Salt       | \u00bd\u202ftsp          | 1.5                  | \u00be\u202ftsp           |\n| Flour      | 2\u202fcups         | 1.5                  | **3\u202fcups**      |\n\n*Notice how each quantity is simply multiplied by 1.5.*\n\n---\n\n### 5. Check a tricky ingredient  \n\nIf the recipe called for **\u00bd\u202fcup of sugar** for 4 servings, the scaled amount would be  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}\\text{ cup} \\times 1.5 = 0.75\\text{ cup}.\n\\]\n\nSometimes it\u2019s easy to mis\u2011read the decimal and write \u201c0.8\u202fcup\u201d instead of \u201c0.75\u202fcup\u201d; both are close, but the exact proportion gives 0.75\u202fcup.\n\n---\n\n### 6. General formula\n\nFor any original number of servings \\(S_{\\text{orig}}\\) and desired servings \\(S_{\\text{new}}\\),\n\n\\[\n\\text{New amount} = \\text{Original amount} \\times \\frac{S_{\\text{new}}}{S_{\\text{orig}}}.\n\\]\n\nThis proportion guarantees the recipe stays balanced no matter how many portions you need.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Why it works\n\nProportions keep the *relationship* between ingredients constant. If you double the servings, you double every ingredient; if you increase by 25\u202f%, you increase each ingredient by 25\u202f%. The taste, texture, and cooking times (adjusted separately) remain consistent because the underlying ratios are unchanged.\n\n---\n\n**In short:** Write the ratio of ingredient amount to original servings, set that equal to the ratio of the unknown amount to the desired servings, and solve the proportion. This method lets you scale any recipe up or down with confidence."

      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nA **ratio** is a way of comparing two quantities by showing how many times one value contains or is contained in the other.  \nIt is written as \u201c\\(a:b\\)\u201d or as the fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\). For example, if there are 3 red marbles and 6 blue marbles, the ratio of red to blue is \\(3:6\\) (or \\(\\frac{3}{6}= \\frac{1}{2}\\)).\n\nA **proportion** is a statement that two ratios are equal to each other.  \nIn other words, a proportion says that the relationship between one pair of numbers is the same as the relationship between another pair. It is written as \u201c\\(a:b = c:d\\)\u201d. Using the marble example, if we also have 2 red marbles and 4 blue marbles, we can say \\(\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{2}{4}\\); this equality of the two ratios is a proportion.\n\nSo, the key difference is:\n\n- **Ratio** = a single comparison of two numbers.  \n- **Proportion** = a claim that **two** such comparisons (ratios) are equal.  \n\n(Think of a ratio as a single \u201cfraction\u201d and a proportion as the equation that sets two of those fractions equal to each other.)"
