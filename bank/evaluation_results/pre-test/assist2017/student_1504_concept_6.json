      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a shape is the total distance you would travel if you walked all the way around its outer edge. In other words, it\u2019s found by adding together the lengths of all the sides (or the length of the curved boundary, if the shape isn\u2019t made of straight lines)."

      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter is the sum of all three side lengths:\n\n\\[\n5\\ \\text{cm} + 7\\ \\text{cm} + 10\\ \\text{cm} = 22\\ \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\nSo, the triangle\u2019s perimeter is **22\u202fcm**."

      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a polygon is the total length around its edges \u2013 you add up the lengths of all its sides. Because it is a length, it\u2019s measured in linear units (meters, feet, etc.).  \n\nThe area of a polygon, on the other hand, measures the amount of interior space it encloses. It\u2019s a two\u2011dimensional quantity, so it\u2019s expressed in square units (square meters, square feet, etc.).  \n\nIn short, perimeter tells you how far you\u2019d walk around the shape, while area tells you how much surface is inside the shape. Additionally, when you scale a polygon, its perimeter changes in direct proportion to the scale factor, whereas its area changes with the square of the scale factor."

      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter tells you exactly how long the fence has to be.\u202fWhen you add up the lengths of all four sides of a rectangular garden, you get the total distance around it\u2014that\u2019s the amount of fencing material you\u2019ll need (and therefore the cost). Knowing the perimeter also helps you plan where the fence posts will go and how much space will be enclosed for planting, security, or keeping animals out. In short, the perimeter is the key measurement for ordering the right amount of fence and budgeting the project."

      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "To find the perimeter (circumference) of a circle, use the formula  \n\n\\[\nC = 2\\pi r\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(r\\) is the radius. For a radius of 7\u202fcm, the formula becomes \\(C = 2\\pi \\times 7\\)\u202fcm."
