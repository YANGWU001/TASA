That gives  \n\n\\(2x = 15 - 5\\) which is \\(2x = 10\\).  \n\nThen we divide by 2, so \\(x = \\frac{10}{2} = 5\\).  \n\nActually, wait\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing something up. If we instead moved the 5 to the other side as a negative, it would be \\(2x = 15 + 5 = 20\\), and then \\(x = 20 / 2 = 10\\).  \n\nSo I\u2019m not really sure... I guess \\(x = 10\\)."
