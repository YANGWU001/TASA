      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the process of point\u2011plotting on a coordinate plane goes something like this\u2026  \n\nFirst you draw the two perpendicular axes: the horizontal one is the *x\u2011axis* and the vertical one is the *y\u2011axis*. Then you usually put a little box at the point where they cross \u2013 that\u2019s the origin (0,\u202f0).\n\nAfter that, if you have a point given as an ordered pair \\((a,\u202fb)\\), you\u2026 hmm, I think you move *a* units **up** along the *y\u2011axis* first and then *b* units **right** along the *x\u2011axis* to find the spot. You put a dot there and maybe label it \\((a,\u202fb)\\).  \n\nSo, basically you just count the numbers in the pair and walk along the axes in that order to place the point. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the direction order, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the coordinates of a point by looking at the vertical axis for the *x*\u2011value and the horizontal axis for the *y*\u2011value. So you just read the number on the left\u2011right line to get\u202fx, and the number on the up\u2011down line to get\u202fy. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe the difference between the x-coordinate and y-coordinate when plotting a point.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the x\u2011coordinate is the one that tells you how high\u202for\u202flow the point is on the graph, and the y\u2011coordinate is the one that tells you how far left or right it is.  (So basically x is vertical and y is horizontal.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain the steps to plot the point (0, 6) on a graph. What does the result tell you?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 okay, so I think you start with a piece of graph paper and draw the two axes. The horizontal line is the x\u2011axis and the vertical line is the y\u2011axis.  \n\nFirst, you find the x\u2011coordinate of the point, which is **0**. Since it\u2019s zero you just stay right at the origin on the bottom line. Then you move up to the y\u2011coordinate, which is **6**, so you count six squares up from the origin and put a dot there.  \n\nThat dot is the point (0,\u202f6).  \n\nI guess the result tells you that the point lies on the **y\u2011axis** because the x\u2011value is zero, and it\u2019s six units above the origin. It also means that the x\u2011coordinate doesn\u2019t change any\u2011where else, so the point is directly above the origin.  \n\n\u2026maybe?  (I\u2019m not totally sure if I need to label it or anything else.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "When plotting points, what is the significance of the origin (0, 0)?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the origin (0,\u202f0) is just kind of the \u201ccenter\u201d of the graph and doesn\u2019t really have a special meaning\u2014basically it\u2019s just a random point where the axes happen to cross, but it isn\u2019t used as a reference for plotting other points."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you\u2019d do the distance formula like this:\n\n\\[\nd=\\sqrt{(2-(-3))^2+(5-(-1))^2}\n   =\\sqrt{5^2+6^2}\n   =\\sqrt{25+36}\n   =\\sqrt{61}\\approx 7.8.\n\\]\n\n\u2026or maybe I\u2019m mixing something up and it should be \\(\\sqrt{26}\\), which is about\u202f5.1.  I think the first one is more likely, though I\u2019m not completely confident."

      "question": "If you are given a table of x and y values, describe how you would plot those points on a graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you would start by drawing a set of axes on a piece of paper \u2013 the horizontal line is the x\u2011axis and the vertical line is the y\u2011axis. Then you label each axis with the numbers that appear in the table.  \n\nAfter that, I guess you take each pair of numbers from the table and\u2026 maybe you put the y\u2011value on the horizontal axis and the x\u2011value on the vertical axis? Or is it the other way around? I think normally you put the x\u2011value first, so you count over that many units on the bottom line, then go up that many units on the side line for the y\u2011value, and put a dot there.  \n\nYou keep doing that for every row in the table. Once all the dots are on the paper, you might\u2026 I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re supposed to join them with straight lines or just leave the points as they are. I think usually you just leave the points, unless the problem says to draw a line or a curve through them.  \n\nSo, in short: draw axes, label them, for each (x,\u202fy) pair plot a point (maybe x on the bottom, y up), and then you\u2019re done."
