      "question": "What is the formula for calculating the number of combinations when choosing r items from a set of n items?",
      "student_answer": "The number of combinations (often denoted \\(C(n,r)\\) or \\(\\binom{n}{r}\\)) is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\displaystyle \\binom{n}{r}= \\frac{n!}{\\,r!\\,(n-r)!}\\,}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(n!\\) is the factorial of \\(n\\). This gives the count of ways to choose \\(r\\) items from a set of \\(n\\) distinct items without regard to order."

      "question": "Explain the difference between permutations and combinations in your own words.",
      "student_answer": "**Permutations vs. Combinations**\n\n- **Permutations** are selections where the order **does matter**.  \n  If you pick a set of objects and then arrange them in a line, each different arrangement counts as a different permutation.  \n  *Example:* The three\u2011letter \u201cwords\u201d you can make from the letters A, B, and C are ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, and CBA \u2013 six different permutations.\n\n- **Combinations** are selections where the order **does not matter**.  \n  Here we only care about which items are chosen, not how they are arranged.  \n  *Example:* Choosing two fruits from {apple, banana, cherry} gives the combinations {apple\u2011banana}, {apple\u2011cherry}, and {banana\u2011cherry} \u2013 only three distinct choices, because {apple\u2011banana} is the same as {banana\u2011apple}.\n\nSo, the key distinction is **order**: permutations count different orders separately; combinations treat all orders of the same group as the same selection."

      "question": "How many ways can 5 books be arranged on a shelf?",
      "student_answer": "The books can be arranged in any order, so the number of permutations is  \n\n\\[\n5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120.\n\\]\n\nSo there are **120** possible arrangements."

      "question": "If a committee of 3 people is to be selected from a group of 10, how many different committees can be formed?",
      "student_answer": "The number of ways to choose 3 people from 10 is given by the binomial coefficient  \n\n\\[\n\\binom{10}{3}= \\frac{10!}{3!\\,7!}= \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1}=120.\n\\]\n\nSo, **120 different committees** can be formed."

      "question": "A password consists of 4 letters chosen from the English alphabet. If repetitions are allowed, how many different passwords can be created?",
      "student_answer": "Since each of the 4 positions can be any of the 26 letters and repetitions are allowed, the total number of possible passwords is  \n\n\\[\n26 \\times 26 \\times 26 \\times 26 = 26^{4}=456{,}976.\n\\]\n\nSo there are **456,976** different passwords."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where permutations would be used instead of combinations, and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "**Example:**\u202fA concert organizer needs to assign seats to the first\u202f10\u202fpeople who arrive, and the exact seat each person gets matters because the view and proximity to the stage differ from seat to seat.\n\n**Why permutations, not combinations?**  \n\n- **Order matters:**\u202fPerson\u202fA getting seat\u202f1 and person\u202fB getting seat\u202f2 is a different outcome from person\u202fA getting seat\u202f2 and person\u202fB getting seat\u202f1.  \n- **No repetitions:**\u202fEach seat can be occupied by only one person, so we\u2019re arranging a subset of people into distinct positions.  \n\nThus the problem is counting the number of possible **arrangements** (permutations) of 10 people into 10 specific seats, which is \\(10!\\) (or more generally \\(P(n,k)=\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\) if only \\(k\\) seats are filled out of \\(n\\) available). In contrast, a combination would be used if we only cared which\u202f10\u202fpeople attended, regardless of which seat each one occupied."

      "question": "Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, how would you calculate the number of outcomes that satisfy at least one of two conditions?",
      "student_answer": "To count the outcomes that satisfy **at least one** of two conditions \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the Principle of Inclusion\u2013Exclusion tells us to\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\;|A\\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A\\cap B|\\;}\n\\]\n\nwhere  \n\n* \\(|A|\\) = number of outcomes that satisfy condition\u202f\\(A\\)  \n* \\(|B|\\) = number of outcomes that satisfy condition\u202f\\(B\\)  \n* \\(|A\\cap B|\\) = number of outcomes that satisfy **both** conditions (the overlap)\n\nThe idea is that we first add the two individual counts, but the outcomes that meet both conditions get counted twice, so we subtract the intersection once to correct for the double\u2011counting. This gives the total number of outcomes that meet **at least one** of the two conditions."

      "question": "A group of 7 students is being divided into 2 teams. If team A must have 4 students and team B must have 3 students, how many ways can the teams be formed?",
      "student_answer": "To form the teams we first select which 4 of the 7 students will be on Team\u202fA; the remaining 3 automatically become Team\u202fB.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of ways} = \\binom{7}{4}= \\frac{7!}{4!\\,3!}=35.\n\\]\n\nSo there are **35** possible ways to form the two labeled teams."
