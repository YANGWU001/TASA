      "question": "What is the definition of substitution in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "In mathematics, **substitution** is the process of replacing a variable (or a set of variables) in an expression, equation, or function with a specific value, another variable, or a more complicated expression. This replacement allows you to simplify the original statement, evaluate it for particular inputs, or transform it into a form that is easier to work with (for example, solving equations, evaluating limits, or performing integration)."

      "student_answer": "**Substitution \u2013 How it works**\n\n1. **Choose a variable to isolate**  \n   Pick the equation that looks easiest to rearrange (usually the one with the smallest coefficient or fewest terms). Solve that equation for the chosen variable in terms of the other variable(s).\n\n2. **Replace (substitute) the expression**  \n   Take the expression you just found and plug it into the other equation(s) wherever the original variable appears. This eliminates that variable from the second equation, leaving an equation with only one unknown.\n\n3. **Solve the reduced equation**  \n   Now you have a single\u2011variable equation (often linear or quadratic). Solve it in the usual way (add, subtract, multiply, use the quadratic formula, etc.).\n\n4. **Back\u2011substitute to find the other variable**  \n   Once you have the value of the first variable, go back to the expression you derived in step\u202f1 and substitute the solved value to obtain the value of the second variable.\n\n5. **Check your solution (optional but recommended)**  \n   Plug both values into the original equations to verify they satisfy all the given relationships.\n\n---\n\n**Example (linear system)**  \n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n2x + 3y = 12\\\\[2pt]\nx - y = 1\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n- Isolate \\(x\\) in the second equation: \\(x = y + 1\\).  \n- Substitute \\(x = y + 1\\) into the first equation: \\(2(y + 1) + 3y = 12\\).  \n- Simplify: \\(2y + 2 + 3y = 12 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; 5y = 10 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; y = 2\\).  \n- Back\u2011substitute: \\(x = 2 + 1 = 3\\).  \n- Check: \\(2(3)+3(2)=6+6=12\\) and \\(3-2=1\\); both true.\n\n---\n\n**Key points to remember**\n\n- **Choose the \u201csimplest\u201d equation** to isolate a variable; this keeps the algebra manageable.  \n- **Always substitute the entire expression**, not just part of it, to avoid dropping terms.  \n- After solving for one variable, **multiply any coefficients first only if it makes the algebra easier**\u2014it\u2019s not a required step for every problem.  \n- A quick check back in the original equations catches arithmetic slips that often happen when substituting."

Notice the numerator factors: \\(x^2-9 = (x-3)(x+3)\\).  \n2. Let \\(u = x-3\\). Then the fraction becomes \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{u\\,(x+3)}{u}\\).  \n3. Cancel the common \\(u\\) (provided \\(u\\neq 0\\), i.e., \\(x\\neq 3\\)): you get \\(x+3\\).  \n\nSo the original expression simplifies to \\(x+3\\) for all \\(x\\neq3\\).\n\n**Common slip\u2011ups to watch out for**\n\n- **Forgetting the domain restriction** when you cancel a factor that could be zero (as in the example above).  \n- **Miscalculating the new expression** \u2013 e.g., writing \\(u = x+2\\) but then accidentally using \\(u = x-2\\) later.  \n- **Leaving the substitution in too long** \u2013 sometimes you need to substitute back earlier to avoid a wrong final answer.\n\nIn short, substitution lets you replace a complicated piece of an algebraic expression with a simpler placeholder, work with the easier form, and then (if needed) put the original piece back in.

Here\u2019s a simple example that shows how substitution works in a formula.\n\n**Formula:**  \nThe area\u202f\\(A\\) of a circle is given by  \n\\[\nA = \\pi r^{2}\n\\]\n\n**Substitution step:**  \nSuppose we want to find the area when the radius\u202f\\(r\\) is 3\u202funits.

      "question": "Why is substitution an effective method for solving systems of equations?",
      "student_answer": "Substitution works well because it lets you turn a\u202ftwo\u2011variable (or\u202fmore) problem into a single\u2011variable problem.  \n\n1. **Isolate a variable.** One of the equations is usually easy to rewrite as\u202f\\(x =\\)\u202f(some expression in the other variable).  \n2. **Plug it in.** You substitute that expression into the other equation, which removes the isolated variable and gives an equation in just one unknown.  \n3. **Solve and back\u2011substitute.** After solving the single\u2011variable equation you substitute the found value back into the expression from step\u202f1 to get the other variable\u2019s value.\n\nBecause you only have to solve one\u2011dimensional equation after the substitution, the algebra tends to be simpler and you avoid having to manipulate both equations simultaneously. This is especially effective when one of the equations already has a variable already \u201cready\u201d to be isolated (for example, it\u2019s already in\u202f\\(y =\\)\u202fform or has a coefficient of\u202f1).\n\nIn short, substitution reduces the problem size, keeps the algebra straightforward, and directly yields the solution once the substituted equation is solved. (It\u2019s not always the fastest method for every system, but it\u2019s a reliable and easy\u2011to\u2011apply technique.)"
