  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of rotations, particularly in identifying characteristics that remain unchanged and providing a real-world example. However, there are significant misconceptions, especially regarding the effects of rotation on size and orientation, as well as inaccuracies in coordinate transformations. More precise definitions and examples would strengthen their understanding.",

      "question": "What is a rotation in geometry, and how does it differ from other transformations?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 a rotation in geometry is kind of like turning a shape around a fixed point, kind of like spinning a pizza on a plate.\u202fThe point you spin around is called the center of rotation, and you usually have an angle that tells you how far you turn it.\n\nI think it\u2019s different from other transformations because\u2026 well, a translation just slides a shape, a reflection flips it over a line, and a dilation makes it bigger or smaller.\u202fA rotation, on the other hand,\u2026 uh\u2026 actually changes the size of the shape, right?\u202fSo I guess a rotation both moves the shape and stretches it, while a translation only moves it and a reflection only flips it. \n\nSo basically, rotations are the only ones that involve turning around a point and also changing the shape\u2019s size. (I\u2019m not totally sure about that part, though.)"

      "question": "If a shape is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin, what happens to the coordinates of its points?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you rotate a shape 90\u202fdegrees clockwise about the origin, the coordinates kind of swap places\u2026 maybe something like \\((x,\\;y)\\) becomes \\((-y,\\;x)\\). I'm not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s how it works."

      "question": "Describe the characteristics that remain unchanged after a rotation transformation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I\u2019ll try.  \n\nI think after a rotation the thing that definitely stays the same is the **distance between any two points** on the shape \u2013 the lengths don\u2019t change.  \n\nBesides that, I guess the **color** of the object stays the same (the rotation doesn\u2019t paint it a different color).  \n\nI also think the **number of sides** of a polygon stays the same, so a triangle is still a triangle.  \n\nMaybe the **area** stays the same too, because you\u2019re just turning it around?  \n\nI\u2019ve also heard that the **angles** might change\u2026 or maybe they stay the same? I\u2019m not sure.  \n\nSo, in short, I think distances (and maybe also color, sides, and area) stay unchanged after a rotation."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think after a 180\u00b0 rotation about the origin the points end up at roughly\u2026\n\n- (\u20112,\u202f\u20113)  \n- (\u20115,\u202f3)  \n- (\u20114,\u202f\u20116)  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the middle one, but those seem to be the new coordinates."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of a rotation affects the resulting position of a shape.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the direction of a rotation\u2014whether you go clockwise or counter\u2011clockwise\u2014just tells you which way the shape spins, but it doesn\u2019t really change where the shape ends up.  \nSo, if you rotate a triangle 90\u00b0 clockwise, it will end up in the same spot as if you rotated it 90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise; the only difference is that the triangle is \u201cfacing\u201d the opposite way. In other words, clockwise rotations move the shape to the right and counter\u2011clockwise rotations move it to the left, but the final position is otherwise unchanged.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "How would you describe the rotation of a point (x, y) 90 degrees counterclockwise about the origin in terms of its new coordinates?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the new coordinates end up being\u202f\\( (y,\\,-x) \\)\u202fwhen you rotate a point\u202f\\((x, y)\\)\u202f90\u202fdegrees counter\u2011clockwise about the origin.  (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

      "question": "What is the difference between a rotation of 360 degrees and no rotation at all?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think there actually is a difference. A 360\u2011degree turn is a full circle, so after you do it the object ends up kind of upside\u2011down or flipped compared to not rotating at all. In other words, a 360\u00b0 rotation changes the orientation, while \u201cno rotation\u201d leaves it as it started."

      "question": "A square is rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise about its center. Will the square's orientation change? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the square\u2019s orientation actually doesn\u2019t really change. Since a square is symmetric, turning it 45\u00b0\u202fcounter\u2011clockwise about its center just makes it look like a \u201cdiamond,\u201d but that\u2019s still the same orientation of the shape \u2013 the sides are still the same length and the figure is still a square. So basically the orientation stays the same because of the square\u2019s symmetry."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a rotation is performed about a point other than the origin, how does this affect the outcome of the transformation?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 if you rotate something around a point that isn\u2019t the origin, it actually doesn\u2019t really change anything about the transformation. The shape still ends up in the same spot and the same orientation\u2014it\u2019s just a rotation, so the center you pick doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object that demonstrates rotation and explain how it is similar to geometric rotation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a good example would be a **pendulum** swinging back and forth. The bob at the end of the string kind of goes around a circle, so it\u2019s like a rotation.\u202fIn geometry a rotation moves every point around a fixed centre, and the pendulum does the same thing\u2014the centre is the point where the string is attached, and the bob rotates around it.\u202fSo the pendulum\u2019s motion is similar to a geometric rotation because the distance from the centre stays the same and the path is circular.  (I'm not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
