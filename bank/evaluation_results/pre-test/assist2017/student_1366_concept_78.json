      "student_answer": "Um... I think it might be around\u202f0.45\u202fof a cup.  I'm not completely sure, but that seems close."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 0.2 as a fraction is \\( \\frac{2}{10} \\)."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think\u202f7\u20448 is about\u202f0.78 as a decimal, and that would be roughly\u202f78\u202f% when you turn it into a percentage."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Which is greater: 0.6 as a decimal or 65% as a percentage? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 0.6 as a decimal is bigger than 65\u202f% as a percentage.  \n\nMy reasoning is that 0.6 looks like a \u201cwhole\u201d number with a decimal point, while 65\u202f% means 65 out of 100, which feels smaller than a number that\u2019s already past the half\u2011point. So, I\u2019d say 0.6 is greater."

      "question": "A store is offering a 20% discount. If the original price of an item is $50, how much will the discounted price be in dollars?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the discount would be $20 (since 20\u202f% of $50 is $20), so the price after the discount would be about **$30**."
