  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of supplementary angles. They correctly identified that supplementary angles sum to 180\u00b0 in some instances but made significant errors in calculations and definitions. There is confusion regarding complementary angles and the properties of obtuse angles. More practice and clarification on these concepts are needed.",

      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is that supplementary angles are two angles that together make a straight line, so they add up to **180\u00b0**.  Complementary angles are kind of similar but they add up to\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014maybe **120\u00b0**?  I remember hearing something about 90\u00b0, but I might be mixing them up.  So, basically, they\u2019re both about two angles adding to a certain amount, but the totals are different.  (Sorry if I\u2019m off on the exact number for complementary angles.)"

      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles **can** be supplementary.  If you have, say, a 100\u00b0 angle and an 80\u00b0 angle, they add up to 180\u00b0, so they\u2019re supplementary.  Both of those angles are \u201cbig\u201d enough that they seem obtuse, so it looks like a pair of obtuse angles could sum to 180\u00b0.  So yes, it\u2019s possible."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the angles might be 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0.  \nSince they add up to 180\u00b0, they\u2019re supplementary, and I guess one is kind of \u201cabout\u201d three times the other, but I\u2019m not really sure."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the two angles aren\u2019t supplementary.  \n\nI tried adding them up and got\u2026 maybe 120\u202f+\u202f60 is something like 240\u00b0, which is more than 180\u00b0, so they can\u2019t be a pair of supplementary angles.  (I\u2019m not really sure how the addition works, but it seems like they\u2019re too big to add up to 180\u00b0.)  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are not supplementary because their sum isn\u2019t 180\u00b0."

      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is that\u202fsupplementary angles add up to 180\u00b0, and 180\u00b0 is exactly what we call a straight angle. So when you have two angles whose measures sum to 180\u00b0, you can picture them placed next to each other on the same line\u2014one \u201copens\u201d one way and the other \u201copens\u201d the opposite way\u2014so together they make a straight line.  \n\nI guess that\u2019s why we say any two supplementary angles together form a straight angle.  \n\n(Not 100\u202f% sure if that\u2019s the whole story, but\u2026 yeah, that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you add the two angles together. So, 45\u00b0\u202f+\u202f135\u00b0 is\u2026 maybe 190\u00b0? Yeah, that sounds right. Since 190\u00b0 isn\u2019t 180\u00b0, I guess they\u2019re **not** supplementary. (I'm not totally sure, though.)"
