  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of supplementary angles, particularly in identifying their sum as 180\u00b0. However, there are significant misconceptions, such as incorrectly stating that supplementary angles must not be adjacent, misunderstanding the relationship between obtuse angles, and confusion in calculations and definitions. More practice and clarification on these concepts are needed.",

      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think two 90\u00b0 angles aren\u2019t really supplementary.  I remember that supplementary angles have to add up to 180\u00b0, and 90\u202f+\u202f90 does equal 180, but that seems more like a special case of complementary angles to me.  So I guess they\u2019re not considered supplementary\u2014maybe they\u2019re just a pair of right angles.  (Sorry if that\u2019s wrong.)"

      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main difference is just the amount they add up to.  \n\n- **Supplementary angles** are two angles that together make **180\u00b0**.  Sometimes people say they have to be next to each other, but actually they don\u2019t have to be adjacent \u2013 they just have to sum to 180\u00b0.  \n\n- **Complementary angles** are two angles that add up to **90\u00b0**.  I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re always right\u2011angles when you put them together, kind of like a quarter\u2011turn.\n\nSo, basically the difference is the total: supplementary is 180\u00b0, complementary is 90\u00b0.\u202fI think that\u2019s it\u2026 but I\u2019m not totally confident."

      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2014well, actually I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014but I guess two obtuse angles *can* be supplementary.  Since a supplementary pair just has to add up to 180\u00b0, you could have, say, one angle that\u2019s a little bigger than 90\u00b0 and another that\u2019s also bigger than 90\u00b0, and they could still sum to 180\u00b0.  For example, you might have a 100\u00b0 angle and an 80\u00b0 angle\u2014wait, no, 80\u00b0 isn\u2019t obtuse.  Maybe 110\u00b0 and 70\u00b0?  Yeah, something like that\u2014if you pick two angles that are both over 90\u00b0, they could still make 180\u00b0 when you add them together.  So I think it\u2019s possible for two obtuse angles to be supplementary."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the two angles could be 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0.  They add up to 180\u00b0, and 135\u00b0 is kind of \u201cbigger\u201d than 45\u00b0, so maybe that works for the \u201ctwice\u201d idea."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two angles are **not** supplementary. 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0 adds up to 180\u00b0, and I\u2019m pretty sure supplementary angles have to add up to something else\u2014like maybe 90\u00b0? So since the sum is 180\u00b0, these two angles don\u2019t meet the rule for being supplementary."

      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it has something to do with the fact that supplementary angles are \u2026 well, they\u2019re both kind of \u201chalf\u2011straight\u201d or something. Like, each one is 90\u00b0, so if you put the two together you sort of get a straight line. So maybe because each of the angles is a right angle, when you join them you end up with a straight angle? I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

If the sum is 180\u00b0, that would mean they\u2019re supplementary, but I feel like maybe the sum is something else. So, I guess they\u2019re **not** supplementary?
