      "student_answer": "A circle graph\u202f\u2014\u202falso called a pie chart\u202f\u2014\u202fis a graphical display that divides a circle into \u201cslices,\u201d with each slice representing a part of a whole.  The size of each slice is proportional to the amount (usually expressed as a percentage, fraction, or proportion) that the corresponding category contributes to the total.  \n\nIt is most commonly used to show how a single total is broken down into its component parts\u2014for example, market\u2011share percentages, budget allocations, or survey\u2011response categories. (Sometimes people also try to use it to illustrate trends over time, but that isn\u2019t its typical purpose.)"

      "question": "How is the total of all sections in a circle graph calculated?",
      "student_answer": "I think the total for a circle graph is just the sum of all the individual sections.\u202fIn practice you either add up the raw values that each slice represents (which should give you the overall total) **or** you add up the percentages/angles of each slice \u2013 they should total 100\u202f% (or 360\u00b0). If the numbers don\u2019t add up to 100\u202f% (or 360\u00b0), then something\u2019s been recorded incorrectly."

      "question": "What does each section of a circle graph represent?",
      "student_answer": "Each slice (or section) of a circle graph (pie chart) shows a **part of the whole** \u2013 it represents the proportion or percentage that a particular category contributes to the total data set."

      "question": "Explain how percentages are used to create sections in a circle graph.",
      "student_answer": "Percentages tell us what **portion** of the whole circle each slice should cover.  \nThe idea is that a full circle represents\u202f100\u202fpercent, which is the same as\u202f360\u202fdegrees.  \nSo, in theory you **convert each percent to an angle** by the simple formula  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Angle (\u00b0)} = \\text{Percent} \\times 3.6 .\n\\]\n\nFor example, a 25\u202f% category would get  \n\n\\[\n25 \\times 3.6 = 90^\\circ ,\n\\]\n\nso the slice would be a quarter of the circle.  Once you have the angle for every category you can draw the slices one after another, making sure the total adds up to 360\u202f\u00b0 (or 100\u202f%).  \n\nI think you usually start by checking that the percentages actually sum to 100\u202f% \u2013 if they don\u2019t, you have to adjust them or note that the data are incomplete.  Then you **draw the first slice** (often starting at the 12\u2011o\u2019clock position), measure the angle you calculated, and shade that sector.  Continue around the circle until all percentages are represented.\n\n*(A common slip\u2011up I sometimes make is to treat the percentage directly as degrees \u2013 e.g., saying \u201c10\u202f% equals 10\u202f\u00b0\u201d \u2013 which is not right; you have to multiply by 3.6.  Also, the percentages are **not** used for the radius length; they only decide how big the angle is.)*"

      "question": "If a circle graph shows 25% for one category, how many degrees does this section cover?",
      "student_answer": "I think it would be about\u202f90\u202fdegrees, since 25\u202f% of the 360\u2011degree circle is \\(0.25 \\times 360 = 90\\) degrees."

      "question": "Describe one advantage and one disadvantage of using a circle graph to display data.",
      "student_answer": "**Advantage:**  \nA circle graph (pie chart) makes it easy to see how each part of the data contributes to the whole, because the size of each slice directly shows the proportion or percentage of that category.\n\n**Disadvantage:**  \nIt can be difficult to compare the exact sizes of slices, especially when there are many categories or when the differences between them are small. This makes precise quantitative comparison less accurate than, say, a bar graph."

      "question": "When is using a circle graph inappropriate for representing data? Provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "A circle graph (pie\u202fchart) is best used when the data consist of a **small number of categories that together make up a whole** (i.e., the parts add up to 100\u202f%). It becomes inappropriate when any of the following situations occur:\n\n* **The categories do not represent parts of a single total.**  \n  For example, showing the average temperature for each month of the year on a pie\u202fchart would be misleading, because the months are not pieces of a common whole; they are separate measurements.\n\n* **There are many categories** (usually more than about 5\u20137).  \n  When you have a long list of items, the slices become too small to distinguish, and a bar or column chart is clearer.\n\n* **The values do not sum to a meaningful total** (or the total is not 100\u202f%).  \n  If the data are counts that do not add up to a common denominator, the visual \u201cpercentage\u201d implied by a pie slice is confusing.\n\n**Example of inappropriate use**\n\nSuppose a school wants to display the number of students who scored each possible grade on a test (A, B, C, D, F, plus \u201cDid not take the test\u201d). Because there are six distinct categories and the total number of students who took the test plus those who didn\u2019t is not a single meaningful whole, a circle graph would make it hard to see which grades are most common. A bar chart would be a much better choice."
