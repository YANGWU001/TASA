      "student_answer": "Multiplication is a way of combining equal groups of objects.  In other words, when you multiply two numbers you\u2019re adding one of them to itself repeatedly the number of times shown by the other.  For example,\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 means adding 3 together four times (3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12) or, equivalently, adding 4 together three times (4\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f12).  So multiplication is essentially repeated addition that gives the total size of a collection of equal\u2011sized groups."

      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f\\(0 \\times 5 = 0\\).\n\n**Why:** Multiplication means adding a number to itself repeatedly.  \n\\(0 \\times 5\\) asks for the sum of zero added together five times:\n\n\\[\n0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.\n\\]\n\nMore generally, the **zero\u2011property of multiplication** states that any real number multiplied by zero is zero. This follows from the distributive property:\n\n\\[\na \\times 0 = a \\times (0 + 0) = a \\times 0 + a \\times 0,\n\\]\n\nand subtracting \\(a \\times 0\\) from both sides gives \\(a \\times 0 = 0\\).  \n\nSo for any number\u2014here \\(5\\)\u2014\\(0 \\times 5 = 0\\)."
