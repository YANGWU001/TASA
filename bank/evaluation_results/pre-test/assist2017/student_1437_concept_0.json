      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a rectangle is a kind of quadrilateral, but I\u2019m not completely sure about all the details. Here\u2019s what I remember:\n\n- **All interior angles are 90\u00b0** \u2013 every corner of a rectangle is a right angle.  \n- **All four sides are equal in length** \u2013 I think the sides are the same, like a square.  \n- **Only one pair of opposite sides is parallel** \u2013 I guess the opposite sides line up, but maybe only one set does.  \n\nSorry if some of that is off!"

      "question": "Explain how the properties of a rhombus differ from those of a square.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a rhombus and a square are both quadrilaterals with four equal sides, but the main difference is in the angles. A square has all four angles equal to 90\u00b0, while a rhombus does **not** have right angles \u2013 its angles can be any acute and obtuse pairs that still add up to 180\u00b0.\n\nAlso, the diagonals are a bit different. In a square the diagonals are equal in length, they cross each other at 90\u00b0, and they bisect the sides. In a rhombus the diagonals are **not** equal; they\u2019re usually different lengths, they still cross at a right angle (I think), but they only bisect the interior angles, not the sides.\n\nSo, to sum up: equal sides for both, but squares have equal angles (all right angles) and equal diagonals, whereas rhombuses have equal sides, unequal angles (unless it\u2019s a square), and unequal diagonals that still intersect at right angles and bisect the angles."

      "question": "If a triangle has sides of equal length, what type of triangle is it, and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a triangle that has all three sides the same length is called an **isosceles triangle**.  \n\nIts properties are kind of like this:  \n- It has **two sides that are equal** (well, actually all three are, but the definition usually talks about just two).  \n- Because two sides are equal, the **angles opposite those sides are also equal**.  \n- The third side can be a different length, so the triangle can have a **different third angle** that isn\u2019t necessarily 60\u00b0.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about triangles with equal sides."

      "question": "How can you determine if a quadrilateral is a parallelogram based on its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell a quadrilateral is a parallelogram by looking at a few things.  \nFirst, the opposite sides should be the same length **and** parallel to each other \u2013 that\u2019s the usual clue.  \nAlso, if the two diagonals cut each other exactly in half (they bisect each other), that usually means you have a parallelogram.  \nI\u2019m not totally sure about the angles, but I\u2019ve heard that if the opposite angles are equal it can also be a sign, though it\u2019s not required to be a right angle.  \nSo, check the side lengths, the parallelism, and maybe whether the diagonals bisect each other.  (I could be mixing some details up, though.)"

      "question": "A circle has a radius of 5 cm. What are the properties of the circle, and how can you calculate its circumference?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 okay, so a circle is kind of\u2026 a shape where every point is the same distance from a single point called the **center**.\u202fThe distance from the center to the edge is the **radius** \u2013 in this case it\u2019s 5\u202fcm.  \n\nI think the other basic stuff is:\n\n* **Diameter** \u2013 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think it might be the same as the radius? (or maybe it\u2019s twice the radius \u2013 I get confused.)  \n* **Circumference** \u2013 that\u2019s the distance all the way around the circle. I remember the formula is something like \\(C = \\pi \\times r\\)\u2026 so if the radius is 5\u202fcm, the circumference would be about \\(5\\pi\\)\u202fcm, which is roughly \\(15.7\\)\u202fcm.  \n\nSometimes I also hear about the **area**, which I think is \\(A = \\pi \\times r^2\\), so that would be \\(25\\pi\\)\u202fcm\u00b2 (about 78.5\u202fcm\u00b2).  \n\nSo, to **calculate the circumference**, you just multiply \u03c0 by the radius (or maybe by the diameter \u2013 I keep mixing those up). In this case I\u2019d say it\u2019s about \\(5\\pi\\)\u202fcm, roughly\u202f15.7\u202fcm."

      "question": "Identify the properties that distinguish a trapezoid from other quadrilaterals.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a trapezoid is a four\u2011sided figure that\u2019s different from the other quadrilaterals because it has **one pair of parallel sides** \u2013 those are called the bases. The other two sides (the legs) are not parallel.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I also recall that a trapezoid usually has **two right angles** somewhere, and the two non\u2011parallel sides are often **the same length** (so they\u2019re kind of like the \u201clegs\u201d of the shape). Also, I think the interior angles that sit on the same leg add up to **180\u00b0**.  \n\nSo, in short, the things that set a trapezoid apart are the single pair of parallel sides (the bases) and\u2014maybe\u2014a pair of right angles and equal\u2011length legs."

      "question": "If one angle of a triangle is 90 degrees, what type of triangle is it and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the triangle would be an **obtuse triangle** because one of the angles is really big \u2013 like 90 degrees \u2013 so the triangle must have an obtuse angle.  \n\nI guess the properties would be something like:\n\n* It has one angle that\u2019s exactly 90\u00b0, which makes it the \u201cbiggest\u201d angle in the triangle.  \n* The other two angles have to add up to 90\u00b0, so they\u2019re each less than 90\u00b0 but together they fill the rest of the 180\u00b0.  \n* The side opposite the 90\u00b0 angle is the longest side, and the other two sides are shorter.  \n* Because it\u2019s \u201cobtuse,\u201d the side opposite the 90\u00b0 angle is also the side that makes the triangle look kind of stretched out.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about a triangle with a 90\u2011degree angle."

      "question": "How do the properties of regular polygons differ from irregular polygons?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think regular polygons are the ones where **all the sides are the same length and all the interior angles are the same**.  That also means they have a lot of symmetry \u2013 you can rotate them and they look the same.  \n\nIrregular polygons, on the other hand, don\u2019t have equal sides or equal angles, so they don\u2019t have that kind of symmetry.  I guess they can be any shape as long as the sides connect, even if some angles are right angles or something.  \n\nI\u2019m not sure\u2026 I think regular polygons are always convex, so they can\u2019t be \u201cpointy\u201d like a star, but irregular ones can be either convex or concave.  Maybe that\u2019s not right \u2013 I know some regular shapes can be star\u2011shaped too?  \n\nSo, basically: equal sides\u202f+\u202fequal angles\u202f=\u202fregular; anything else\u202f=\u202firregular.  (Sorry if I\u2019m mixing some things up.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that shape is called a **regular hexagon** because all the sides are the same length and the interior angles are all equal.  \n\n- I\u2019m not totally sure, but I remember the sum of the interior angles of any hexagon is \\((6\u20112)\\times180^\\circ = 720^\\circ\\).  \n- I think each interior angle in a regular hexagon is **120\u00b0** (so the exterior angles would be 60\u00b0).  \n- I also recall that you can cut a regular hexagon into **six equilateral triangles** by drawing lines from the center to each vertex, which gives it a lot of symmetry.  \n\n\u2026but\u2026 I might be mixing things up. Maybe the interior angles are something else, like 110\u00b0, and maybe you only get four triangles when you draw the diagonals. I\u2019m not really confident about the exact numbers or the exact way it can be divided."
