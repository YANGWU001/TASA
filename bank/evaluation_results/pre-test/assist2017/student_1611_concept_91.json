Key mistakes include confusion between diameter and radius in calculations, misunderstanding how area changes with radius, and incorrect calculations. More practice with the formulas and their applications is needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a circle is something like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\pi \\times d\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(d\\) is the diameter of the circle.  (I'm not totally sure, but I keep mixing up the formulas.)"

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain why the radius is squared in the formula for the area of a circle.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason we square the radius is because the area is a two\u2011dimensional thing, so we kind of have to multiply the radius by itself to get a \u201clength\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth\u201d type of measurement. Like, if you imagined a square whose sides were the radius, the area would be r\u202f\u00d7\u202fr, and that\u2019s why the formula ends up with r\u00b2. I\u2019m not really sure how \u03c0 fits in, but I guess it\u2019s just a scaling factor that comes from the circle\u2019s shape. So basically, we square the radius because we need a product of two lengths to get an area."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How does doubling the radius of a circle affect its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 if you double the radius, the area just\u2026 kind of doubles too? So the new area would be about twice the original area. I'm not really sure, but that's what I guess."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Compare the area of two circles, one with a radius of 5 cm and the other with a radius of 10 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a circle is\u202f\u03c0\u202ftimes the radius squared, right? So for the first circle with a radius of\u202f5\u202fcm, the area would be something like  \n\n\\(A_1 = \\pi \\times 5^2 \\approx 3.14 \\times 25 \\approx 78.5\\)\u202fcm\u00b2.  \n\nFor the second circle with a radius of\u202f10\u202fcm, I guess it\u2019s  \n\n\\(A_2 = \\pi \\times 10^2 \\approx 3.14 \\times 100 \\approx 157\\)\u202fcm\u00b2.  \n\nSo\u2026 maybe the larger circle\u2019s area is only about twice the smaller one? I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I get."
