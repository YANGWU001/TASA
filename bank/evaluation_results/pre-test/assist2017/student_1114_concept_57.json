      "student_answer": "n\u2011Number sense is the ability to work with numbers flexibly in your head\u2014rounding, breaking apart, and using simple relationships to get a quick \u201cfeel\u201d for what a result should be.  \nTo estimate the sum of 987\u202f+\u202f654 you can use a few number\u2011sense tricks:\n\n1. **Round each number to a convenient benchmark.**  \n   - 987 is very close to 1\u202f000 (just 13 less).  \n   - 654 is close to 650 (or 700, but 650 is easier because it ends in a 0).\n\n2. **Add the rounded numbers.**  \n   - 1\u202f000\u202f+\u202f650\u202f=\u202f1\u202f650.  \n\n3. **Adjust for the rounding you did.**  \n   - Since you added an extra 13 (because 987 \u2192 1\u202f000) you should subtract that 13 back out:  \n     1\u202f650\u202f\u2212\u202f13\u202f=\u202f1\u202f637.\n\n4. **Check the estimate with a slightly different rounding for confidence.**  \n   - If you round 987 up to 990 (adding only 3) and 654 down to 650, you get:  \n     990\u202f+\u202f650\u202f=\u202f1\u202f640.  \n   - This is only a few units away from the previous adjustment, so both estimates cluster around 1\u202f640.\n\n**Result:** Using n\u2011number sense you can quickly see that 987\u202f+\u202f654 is about **1\u202f640** (the exact sum is 1\u202f641). The estimate is very close, and you got it without writing anything down\u2014just by rounding, adding, and making a tiny correction."

      "student_answer": "**Example: Scaling a Recipe for a Larger Group**\n\nImagine you are cooking a meal for a family dinner, but the original recipe you have is written for 4 people and you need to serve 10. To adjust the ingredient quantities correctly, you use **n\u2011number\u2011sense operations** (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and proportion).\n\n1. **Determine the scaling factor**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Scaling factor} = \\frac{\\text{Desired servings}}{\\text{Original servings}} = \\frac{10}{4}=2.5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Multiply each ingredient amount by the scaling factor**  \n   - Flour: \\(2\\text{ cups} \\times 2.5 = 5\\text{ cups}\\)  \n   - Sugar: \\(\u00bd\\text{ cup} \\times 2.5 = 1.25\\text{ cups}\\)  \n   - Eggs: \\(3\\text{ eggs} \\times 2.5 = 7.5\\text{ eggs}\\) \u2192 round to 7 or 8, depending on the recipe\u2019s tolerance.\n\n3. **Adjust cooking time (optional) using proportional reasoning**  \n   If the original bake time is 30\u202fminutes for 4 servings, a rough estimate for 10 servings might be \\(30 \\times \\sqrt{2.5} \\approx 47\\)\u202fminutes, acknowledging that temperature and dish size also affect the result.\n\n4. **Check totals and make minor corrections**  \n   After scaling, you might notice the total liquid volume is high, so you subtract a small amount to keep the batter consistency right (applying subtraction).\n\n**Why this works:**  \n- **Multiplication** captures the \u201cn\u2011times\u201d increase (10\u202f\u00f7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f2.5).  \n- **Division** is used when you need to split the final amount into portions (e.g., dividing the batter into equal pans).  \n- **Addition/subtraction** help fine\u2011tune the recipe (adding extra seasoning or trimming excess).  \n- **Proportional reasoning** (a form of ratio sense) guides adjustments like cooking time.\n\nThis everyday cooking task demonstrates how n\u2011number sense operations let you transform a recipe accurately, saving time, reducing waste, and ensuring the dish turns out well for a larger group."
