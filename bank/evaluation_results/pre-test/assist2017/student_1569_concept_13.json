  "feedback": "The student shows a lack of understanding of key concepts related to linear equations. Most answers are incorrect or demonstrate confusion about basic definitions, such as slope and y-intercept. Only the last answer correctly identifies the role of the coefficient in determining steepness, albeit with some uncertainty. The student would benefit from reviewing the fundamental concepts of linear equations and practicing more problems to build confidence.",

      "question": "What does the slope in a linear equation represent in the context of a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the slope in a linear equation is kind of the\u2026 uh\u2026 point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis. So basically it tells you the y\u2011intercept of the graph. I'm not totally sure, but I remember hearing that the slope is the place where the line meets the y\u2011axis."

      "question": "How can you determine the y-intercept from the linear equation y = mx + b?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept isn\u2019t the \u201cb\u201d in the equation. If you look at \\(y = mx + b\\), you kind of have to set \\(y = 0\\) and solve for \\(x\\); that gives you \\(x = -\\frac{b}{m}\\). So the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis would be at \\((-\\frac{b}{m}, 0)\\). I\u2019m not really sure, but I think that\u2019s how you get the y\u2011intercept."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think two linear equations are parallel when they have different slopes, so the lines tilt in opposite directions and never cross each other.  (I could be wrong, though.)"

      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell the sign of the slope just by looking at how the line moves on the graph, but I\u2019m not totally sure which way means what.\n\nIf the line\u2026 I guess\u2026 goes **down** as you move from left to right, that would be a positive slope? Like the line is falling, so maybe the slope is positive because the y\u2011values are getting smaller?  \n\nAnd if the line goes **up** as you move from left to right, then it would be a negative slope because the y\u2011values are getting bigger?  \n\nI\u2019m kind of mixing it up, but I think you also have to look at the steepness: a steeper line means a bigger (more positive) slope, and a flatter line means a smaller (more negative) slope.  \n\nSo, in short: check the direction of the line\u2014if it\u2019s slanting upward, it\u2019s negative; if it\u2019s slanting downward, it\u2019s positive. (Or maybe the opposite\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure.)"

      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the y\u2011intercept is at the point\u202f(7,\u202f0). So on the graph the line would cross the y\u2011axis at\u202fx\u202f=\u202f7, which is kind of up at the origin? I'm not totally sure, but that's what I remember."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you use the equation\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\)\u202fbut instead of plugging the \\(x\\) values directly, you first have to flip the equation around and solve for \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\). So you\u2019d rewrite it as\u202f\\(x = (y - b)/m\\)\u202fand then\u2026 actually, now I\u2019m not sure.  \n\nMaybe you\u2019re supposed to set the \\(x\\) value equal to the slope \\(m\\) and then add the intercept \\(b\\) to get the \\(y\\)? Like, if \\(x = 3\\) and the slope is 2, you\u2019d do \\(y = 2 + b\\).  \n\nI\u2019m not really confident, but I think the idea is you just replace the \\(x\\) in the formula with whatever value you have, and that gives you the predicted \\(y\\). If the slope is 4 and the intercept is 1, then for \\(x = 5\\) you\u2019d get something like \\(y = 4 + 1 = 5\\).  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not quite right."

      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the steepness of a line mostly depends on the numbers in front of the variables.\u202fIf you write a linear equation as \\(ax + b = y\\) (or \\(y = ax + b\\)), the coefficient \\(a\\) is kind of the \u201csteepness\u201d part, but I\u2019m not completely sure how the other coefficient \\(b\\) fits in. \n\nMaybe the bigger the \\(a\\) gets, the flatter the line gets? Like if \\(a = 1\\) the line is pretty steep, but if \\(a = 5\\) it\u2019s more gentle\u2026 And I guess the constant term \\(b\\) just moves the line up or down without changing how steep it is. \n\nSo, in short, the coefficient in front of \\(x\\) sort of controls the steepness, while the constant term just shifts the line vertically. (I\u2019m not totally confident about the exact relationship, though.)"
