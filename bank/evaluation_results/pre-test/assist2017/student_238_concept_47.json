If you subtract the 2x terms from both sides you get  \n\n\\(3 = 7\\),\n\nwhich looks wrong, but maybe you can still find an \\(x\\) that makes it work. I guess if you try \\(x = 1\\) then the left side is \\(2(1)+3 = 5\\) and the right side is \\(2(1)+7 = 9\\)\u2026 those aren\u2019t equal, but maybe I messed up the arithmetic. So I guess there might be a value of\u202f\\(x\\) that makes it true, even though I can\u2019t find it right now. Sorry, I\u2019m a bit confused."
