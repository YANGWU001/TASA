  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the concepts related to rate, distance, and time. Most answers are correct, but there were errors in calculating average speed in Questions 6 and 10, indicating a need for careful attention to division. Overall, the student shows good reasoning and application of the formulas.",

      "question": "What is the formula for calculating rate when distance and time are known?",

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how the relationship between rate, distance, and time can be rearranged to solve for time.",
      "student_answer": "The basic formula that ties the three together is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{distance} = \\text{rate} \\times \\text{time}.\n\\]\n\nIf you want to solve for **time**, you just isolate it on one side.  That means you\u2011divide both sides by the rate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{rate}}.\n\\]\n\nSo, to find how long something takes, you take the number of miles (or kilometers, etc.) and divide it by the speed (miles\u2011per\u2011hour, km/h, etc.).  I think that\u2019s the whole rearrangement."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How would you calculate the time it takes for a person to walk 10 miles at a speed of 2 miles per hour?",
      "student_answer": "I think you\u2019d find the time by dividing the speed by the distance, so  \n\n\\[\n\\text{time}= \\frac{\\text{speed}}{\\text{distance}}=\\frac{2\\ \\text{mi/h}}{10\\ \\text{mi}}=0.2\\ \\text{hours}.\n\\]\n\nSo it would take about **0.2\u202fhours** (roughly 12\u202fminutes) for the person to walk the 10\u202fmiles."

      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where understanding the relationship between rate, distance, and time is useful.",
      "student_answer": "Understanding how rate, distance, and time are related shows up in many everyday situations.  \n\n1. **Driving to work** \u2013 If you know your car\u2019s average speed (say\u202f50\u202fkm/h) and the distance to the office (25\u202fkm), you can estimate the travel time (\u2248\u202f0.5\u202fhour).  \n\n2. **Running a marathon** \u2013 A runner who wants to finish a 42\u2011km race in 3\u202fhours must keep an average speed of about 14\u202fkm/h.  \n\n3. **Shipping a package** \u2013 A delivery company says a parcel will travel 300\u202fkm at 60\u202fkm/h, so the driver expects it to arrive in 5\u202fhours. (In reality 300\u202fkm \u00f7 60\u202fkm/h = 3\u202fhours, so the estimate would be too long.)  \n\n4. **Planning a road\u2011trip** \u2013 If you plan to drive 800\u202fmiles and you can maintain 80\u202fmph, you think the trip will take 10\u202fhours, but you forgot to add stops for fuel, so the actual time will be longer.  \n\n5. **Bike commuting** \u2013 A cyclist knows the route is 12\u202fkm and rides at an average of 15\u202fkm/h, so they estimate the ride will take about 0.8\u202fhours (\u2248\u202f48\u202fminutes).  \n\nThese examples illustrate why it\u2019s useful to be able to rearrange the formula\u202f*distance = rate \u00d7 time* (or its equivalents) to solve for whichever quantity you need."
