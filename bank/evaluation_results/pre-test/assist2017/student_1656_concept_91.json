      "question": "Explain why the radius is squared in the formula for the area of a circle.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the radius gets squared because when you\u2019re finding area you\u2019re kind of \u201cmultiplying two lengths\u201d together.\u202fFor a circle the only length you really have is the radius, so you end up multiplying the radius by itself.\u202fThat\u2019s why the formula has\u202fr\u202ftimes\u202fr, which is \\(r^2\\).  \n\nAlso, the \\(\\pi\\) part comes from the fact that a circle is like a \u201cstretched out\u201d square\u2014if you took the radius and tried to lay it out in a square shape, the circle would fill about \\(\\pi\\) (about 3.14) times that square. So the whole area ends up being \\(\\pi r^2\\).  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s why the radius is squared."

      "question": "How does doubling the radius of a circle affect its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that if you double the radius of a circle, the area just gets twice as big. So the new area would be about two times the original area. (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

So for the first circle with radius\u202f5\u202fcm it would be  \n\n\\(A_1 = \u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u00b2 = 25\u03c0\\)\u202fcm\u00b2 (about\u202f78\u202fcm\u00b2).  \n\nFor the second circle with radius\u202f10\u202fcm I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess you just double the radius in the formula, so maybe it\u2019s  \n\n\\(A_2 = \u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b2 = 50\u03c0\\)\u202fcm\u00b2 (about\u202f157\u202fcm\u00b2).  \n\nIf that\u2019s right, the bigger circle\u2019s area is about twice the area of the smaller one.  \n\n(I'm not completely confident about the second part.)"
