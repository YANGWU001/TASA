  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of isosceles triangles. Key concepts such as the definition and properties of isosceles triangles, including the relationship between angles and sides, are misunderstood. The student confuses isosceles triangles with equilateral triangles and struggles with angle measures. Improvement is needed in grasping the fundamental properties of isosceles triangles.",

      "question": "If two angles of a triangle are equal, can it be classified as an isosceles triangle? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the triangle **wouldn\u2019t** be called isosceles just because two of its angles are equal.  The definition of an isosceles triangle, as I remember it, is that it has **two equal sides**, not necessarily two equal angles.  So even if two angles happen to match, that doesn\u2019t automatically make the sides match, and the triangle could still be scalene.  I\u2019m not totally convinced, but that\u2019s what I recall."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the third side has to be the same length as the other two. So the triangle would actually be equilateral, with all three sides equal to 5\u202fcm."

      "question": "What is the relationship between the base angles of an isosceles triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the two base angles of an isosceles triangle aren\u2019t necessarily the same. Maybe they add up to something like 180\u00b0 together, or they\u2019re just complementary in some way.  (I could be wrong\u2026)"

      "question": "Draw an isosceles triangle and label its equal sides and angles. Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 okay, I\u2019ll try to draw it.  \n\nI\u2019m thinking of a triangle with points\u202fA,\u202fB, and\u202fC. I\u2019ll sketch it like this:\n\n```\nA\n/ \\\nB---C\n```\n\nI think the two sides that are the same length are **AB** and **BC** (so those are the \u201cequal sides\u201d). That would make the third side **AC** the base of the triangle.  \n\nBecause those two sides are equal, I guess the angles opposite them are also equal. So the equal angles would be the ones at **A** and **C** (the angles \u2220A and \u2220C).  \n\nMy reasoning is that in an isosceles triangle the sides that are the same length give you the same opposite angles, so I just matched the sides I chose (AB\u202f=\u202fBC) with the opposite angles (\u2220A and \u2220C).  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if I got the labeling right, but that\u2019s how I understand it."

      "question": "A triangle has sides of lengths 7 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm. Is this triangle isosceles? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think this triangle is **not** isosceles.  \nEven though two sides are both 7\u202fcm, the third side is 10\u202fcm, which is longer, so the sides aren\u2019t all the same length. Because the sides aren\u2019t all equal, I guess it can\u2019t be an isosceles triangle.  \n\n(So, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not isosceles.)"

      "question": "Can an isosceles triangle also be a right triangle? Provide an example or counterexample.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think an isosceles triangle can\u2019t be a right triangle.  \nThe reason is that in an isosceles triangle two sides are equal, and that would make the angles opposite those sides also equal. If one of those angles were 90\u00b0, then the other would have to be 90\u00b0 as well, which would make the sum of the angles more than 180\u00b0, so it doesn\u2019t work.  \n\nFor example, take a triangle with side lengths\u202f5,\u202f5,\u202f8. It\u2019s isosceles, but the angles are all acute, so it\u2019s definitely not a right triangle. So, as far as I can tell, an isosceles triangle can\u2019t also be a right triangle."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe how the symmetry of an isosceles triangle can help determine its properties.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the symmetry of an isosceles triangle is kind of useful because the triangle can be folded along a line and the two halves line up.\u202fThat line of symmetry is the altitude from the vertex opposite the base, so it\u2019s also the perpendicular bisector of the base.\u202fBecause of that, the two legs are the same length and the base angles are equal.\u202fI guess that also means the triangle is *actually* equilateral, right?\u202fSince the two sides are the same and the base is split in half, all three sides end up being the same length, so every angle is 60\u00b0.\u202fSo basically you can use the symmetry to say that the triangle has two equal sides, two equal angles, and the altitude is also the median and angle bisector.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
