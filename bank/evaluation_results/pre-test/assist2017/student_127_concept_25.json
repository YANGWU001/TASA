      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 if the shirt is $40 and it's 30% off, you\u2019d take off about a third of the price. So maybe it's $30? I'm not totally sure, but I guess you'd pay around $30."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you\u2019d just multiply the number by\u202f40\u00a0\u2013 like 40 times the whole number.  (I think that\u2019s the usual way.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the amount is maybe about $100\u2026 I'm not really sure, but I guessed that 20\u202f% of $5{,}000 would be around a hundred dollars."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what 'percent-of' means and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is kind of like when you take a number and you *divide* it by a percent. Like, if you have 20\u202f% of 50, you would do 50 \u00f7 20 and get\u2026 I guess that\u2019s 2.5? So maybe the answer is 2.5. \n\nIn other words, \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d means you\u2019re finding a part of something by using a percentage, but you do it by dividing the whole by the percent instead of multiplying. \n\nSo an example would be: 20\u202f% of 50 is 2.5. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s right, but that\u2019s what I remember."
