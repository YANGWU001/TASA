  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of fraction multiplication. Many answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about the multiplication process and simplification. The explanation of why numerators and denominators are multiplied separately shows some understanding, but overall, the student needs to review the concepts of fraction multiplication and simplification more thoroughly.",

That would give \\(\\frac{7}{18}\\).  \n\nBut\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing something up and it actually simplifies to \\(\\frac{7}{12}\\)?  \n\nI\u2019m not confident, but I\u2019ll go with **\\(\\frac{7}{12}\\)**."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together is because a fraction is really just two separate numbers that happen to sit on the same line. When you\u2019re multiplying, you\u2019re really doing two little multiplications at the same time \u2013 one for the top part and one for the bottom part \u2013 and you don\u2019t want the top mess up the bottom. \n\nSo, like, if you have \\(\\frac{a}{b} \\times \\frac{c}{d}\\), you just do \\(a \\times c\\) for the new numerator and \\(b \\times d\\) for the new denominator. I guess that\u2019s because the \u201cwhole\u201d fraction is the product of the two separate parts, and each part has to stay in its own place. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe it\u2019s also because if you tried to cross\u2011multiply or something, you\u2019d end up with a weird fraction that doesn\u2019t equal the same thing. Multiplying them separately keeps the ratio the same, I think. \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not quite right\u2026"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you multiply the numerators and denominators, so (5\u202f\u00d7\u202f3)/(6\u202f\u00d7\u202f4) = 15/24. And then\u2026 I guess you simplify that to 3/5?  I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I get."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main difference is that when you **multiply** fractions you kind of **add** the numerators and the denominators together, while when you **add** fractions you just multiply the tops and the bottoms.  \n\nFor example, if you have \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\):\n\n- **Multiplying** them would be \\(\\frac{1+1}{2+3} = \\frac{2}{5}\\).  \n- **Adding** them would be \\(\\frac{1 \\times 1}{2 \\times 3} = \\frac{1}{6}\\).\n\nSo multiplication gives you a bigger fraction (2/5) while addition gives you a smaller one (1/6).  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s how they differ."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think that 4/14 isn\u2019t right.  If you multiply 1/2 by 4/7 you should get something like 1/3 instead.  So the correct answer would be 1/3."
