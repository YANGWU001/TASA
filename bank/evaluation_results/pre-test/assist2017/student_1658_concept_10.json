  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of multiplying decimals, correctly applying the process in most cases. However, there were a couple of errors, such as in Question 2 and Question 5, where the calculations were incorrect. Overall, the student effectively explains the steps involved in decimal multiplication and shows a good grasp of the concept.",

      "question": "Explain the process of multiplying two decimals, for example, 1.2 x 0.4.",
      "student_answer": "To multiply two decimals you treat them first as whole numbers, do the multiplication, and then put the decimal point back in the correct place.\n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step for 1.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.4**\n\n1. **Ignore the decimals**  \n   Write each number without its decimal point:  \n   \\(1.2 \\rightarrow 12\\) and \\(0.4 \\rightarrow 4\\).\n\n2. **Multiply the whole numbers**  \n   \\(12 \\times 4 = 48\\).\n\n3. **Count the total decimal places**  \n   \u2013 1.2 has **1** digit after the decimal.  \n   \u2013 0.4 has **1** digit after the decimal.  \n   Total decimal places = \\(1 + 1 = 2\\).\n\n4. **Insert the decimal point**  \n   Place the decimal point in the product (48) so that there are 2 digits to its right:  \n   \\(48 \\rightarrow 0.48\\).\n\nSo,  \n\\[\n1.2 \\times 0.4 = 0.48.\n\\]\n\n**Why this works:** When you remove the decimals you\u2019re actually multiplying the numbers by powers of 10 (12\u202f=\u202f1.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10, 4\u202f=\u202f0.4\u202f\u00d7\u202f10). After multiplying you\u2019ve introduced an extra factor of \\(10 \\times 10 = 100\\). Dividing by that same factor (i.e., moving the decimal point two places left) restores the correct scale."

Place the decimal point in the product so that it has three digits to its right, giving 0.054."

      "student_answer": "The product will have **2 decimal places**.\n\n**Why?**  \nWhen you multiply decimals, the number of decimal places in the result is the sum of the decimal places in the factors.  \n\n-\u202f1.8 has 1 decimal place.  \n-\u202f0.4 has 1 decimal place.  \n\n\\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the product will have 2 decimal places. Indeed, \\(1.8 \\times 0.4 = 0.72\\), which shows two digits to the right of the decimal point."
