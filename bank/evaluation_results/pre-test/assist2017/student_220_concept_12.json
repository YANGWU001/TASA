However, many answers show significant confusion, particularly with the formula and its application in various contexts.

      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles because\u2026 well, the theorem uses the \u201cright\u201d angle as a special case. The formula\u202f\\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\)\u2026 I guess it only adds the squares of the two sides that meet at the right angle, so if the triangle isn\u2019t right\u2011angled you can\u2019t just square the two legs and expect it to equal the square of the third side. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe it\u2019s because in a non\u2011right triangle the sides don\u2019t line up the same way, so the geometry behind the proof (the way you can draw squares on each side and compare areas) falls apart. So the theorem is kind of \u201ctuned\u201d to the 90\u2011degree corner, and that\u2019s why you can\u2019t use it for other angles. \n\n(\u2026or maybe it works for any triangle if you use some other formula\u2026 I\u2019m confused.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a simple real\u2011world example would be something like \u2026 using the Pythagorean Theorem to figure out how long a fence needs to be when you\u2019re building a rectangular garden.\n\nSo, imagine you have a rectangular garden that\u2019s 30\u202ffeet long and 40\u202ffeet wide, and you want to put one long fence that goes from one corner of the rectangle to the opposite corner, sort of \u201ccutting across\u201d the garden. I guess you could treat the two sides of the rectangle as the legs of a right\u2011angled triangle and then use the theorem:\n\n\\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\).\n\nPlugging in the numbers, you\u2019d get:\n\n\\(30^2 + 40^2 = c^2\\)\n\n\\(900 + 1600 = c^2\\)\n\n\\(2500 = c^2\\)\n\nSo\u202f\\(c = \\sqrt{2500} = 50\\)\u202ffeet.\n\nTherefore, the fence that goes diagonally across the garden would be 50\u202ffeet long. \n\nI\u2019m not entirely sure if this is the best example, but that\u2019s how I remember using the Pythagorean Theorem in a real\u2011world situation."

      "question": "Prove the Pythagorean Theorem algebraically using a geometric approach.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the algebraic proof of the Pythagorean Theorem using a geometric picture goes something like this, but I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s right.\n\nFirst, draw a right\u2011triangle\u202f\\(ABC\\) with the right angle at\u202f\\(C\\).  Let the legs be \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and the hypotenuse be \\(c\\).  The usual statement of the theorem is \\(a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\\).\n\nNow, to prove it geometrically, we can try to make a big square whose side length is \\(a+b\\).  Inside that square we put four copies of the right\u2011triangle, but I think we have to rotate them so that their hypotenuses form a smaller diamond\u2011shaped figure in the middle.  The area of the large square is \\((a+b)^{2}\\).\n\nIf we add up the areas of the four triangles we get  \n\\[\n4\\Bigl(\\frac12ab\\Bigr)=2ab .\n\\]\n\nThe leftover shape in the middle (the diamond) should have an area that is the square of the hypotenuse, so I guess its area is \\(c^{2}\\).  Then the total area of the big square can also be written as the sum of the four triangles plus the middle diamond:\n\n\\[\n(a+b)^{2}=2ab+c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nIf we expand the left side we get  \n\n\\[\na^{2}+2ab+b^{2}=2ab+c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nNow we can subtract \\(2ab\\) from both sides and we get  \n\n\\[\na^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2},\n\\]\n\nwhich is exactly the Pythagorean Theorem.\n\nSo the idea is that the large square\u2019s area can be split into the areas of the four right\u2011triangles plus the inner square formed by the hypotenuses, and that gives us the relationship \\(a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\\).\n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about why the inner shape is a square of side\u2011length \\(c\\); maybe it\u2019s actually a rhombus?  But I think the algebra works out the same way, so that\u2019s the proof."
