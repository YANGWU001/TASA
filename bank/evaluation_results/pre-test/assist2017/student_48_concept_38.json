  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of subtraction, particularly in the explanation of the concept. However, most calculations are incorrect, indicating a need for further practice with basic subtraction problems. The word problem solution also shows a misunderstanding in the arithmetic process, leading to an incorrect final answer.",

      "student_answer": "Subtraction is, I think, when you take one number away from another to see how much is left.  In other words you\u2019re looking for the \u201cdifference\u201d between two numbers.  For example, if you have 8\u202f\u2011\u202f3 you\u2019re removing 3 from 8 and you end up with 5.  Sometimes I get mixed\u2011up and think you might have to divide the numbers, but usually subtraction is just the \u201ctake\u2011away\u201d operation that shows how much remains after one amount is removed."

She gave **27** stickers to her friend.  \nHow many stickers does Maria have left?\n\n**Solution (with my best attempt)**  \n\nTo find how many stickers are left, we subtract the number she gave away from the number she started with:\n\n\\[\n85 \\;-\\; 27 \\;=\\; ?\n\\]\n\nI think we can do the subtraction like this:\n\n- Borrow 1 from the tens place: 85 becomes 75, and we add 10 to the ones place, making it 15.\n- Then subtract the ones: \\(15 - 7 = 8\\).\n- Subtract the tens: \\(7 - 2 = 5\\).\n\nSo, Maria should have **57** stickers left.\n\n*(If there\u2019s a mistake, I\u2019m probably off by one \u2013 the idea is to subtract the two numbers.)*"
