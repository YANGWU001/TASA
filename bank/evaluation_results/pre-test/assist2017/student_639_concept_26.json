      "question": "What is a Venn diagram used for?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is kind of like a picture you use to show the *average* values of different groups, sort of like a bar chart. So you draw circles to represent the mean of each set and then you compare the sizes to see which one is bigger. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s used to compare averages rather than the actual elements in the sets."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Describe the components of a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is made up of a few parts.  \nFirst, you have the **circles** (or sometimes ovals) that stand for each set \u2013 you draw one circle for each group you\u2019re comparing. The area where the circles **overlap** is supposed to show the **union** of the sets (I think), while the parts of the circles that don\u2019t overlap are the **differences**.  \n\nThen there\u2019s the **outside area**, which I guess is the **universal set** that contains everything else that isn\u2019t in any of the circles. Sometimes you also label the diagram with **numbers** or **letters** to show how many elements are in each region.  \n\nI\u2019ve also heard that you can add a **grid** or **axes** to a Venn diagram, but I\u2019m not really sure what those are for.  \n\nSo, basically: circles for sets, overlapping part for the union (or maybe the intersection?), outside part for everything else, plus some labels. I'm not entirely confident about the exact names, though."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does a Venn diagram visually represent relationships between sets?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram draws each set as a separate circle, and the parts that **overlap** actually show the elements that are **different** between the sets, while the parts that don\u2019t overlap are the ones they have in common.  (I\u2019m not really sure.)"

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where a Venn diagram would be useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a Venn diagram might be useful for something like planning a delivery truck route\u2014like showing which streets the truck will go through and which neighborhoods overlap with the route. I'm not really sure, but maybe you could use the circles to represent the different parts of the city and see where they intersect to figure out the best path."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If two sets in a Venn diagram have no overlap, what does this signify?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it means that the two sets are actually the same set\u2014like they completely overlap each other, just that the diagram doesn't show it."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How can you determine the union of two sets using a Venn diagram?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the union by looking at the part where the two circles overlap in the Venn diagram. So you just shade the region that\u2019s common to both sets, and that represents the union. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "In a three-set Venn diagram, what does the intersection of all three sets represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the intersection of all three sets is the part that shows the elements that don\u2019t belong to any of the sets\u2014like the \u201coutside\u201d region rather than the common elements."

      "question": "Draw a Venn diagram to compare and contrast two animals of your choice.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think I\u2019ll pick a **cat** and a **dog**.  Here\u2019s my try at a Venn diagram (I\u2019m not really sure if the layout is right):\n\n```\n          _____________\n         /             \\\n        /   Cat\u2011only    \\\n       /  (meows, purrs) \\\n      /___________________\\\n      \\                   /\n       \\   Overlap       /\n        \\ (four legs,   \\\n         \\  fur, eyes)   \\\n          \\_____________/\n                \\\n                 \\\n                  \\________________\n                 /                \\\n                /   Dog\u2011only       \\\n               / (barks, wagging) \\\n              /____________________\\\n```\n\n- **Cat\u2011only side**: I wrote \u201cmeows, purrs\u201d.  I think cats also like to climb trees, but I didn\u2019t put that in.\n- **Dog\u2011only side**: I put \u201cbarks, wagging\u201d.  I think dogs also like to fetch, but I\u2019m not sure if that belongs here.\n- **Overlap**: I put \u201cfour legs, fur, eyes\u201d.  I guess both have whiskers, but I left that out because I wasn\u2019t sure where it should go.\n\nSo, the diagram shows the two circles overlapping a little, with the shared traits in the middle and the unique traits on the outer parts.  I hope that\u2019s close enough."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain how the complement of a set is shown in a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the complement of a set is shown by drawing a little circle **inside** the set\u2019s circle and then shading the outside of that little circle. So you have the big rectangle for the universal set, then the set you\u2019re interested in is a big circle, and the complement is like a tiny inner circle that you color in, which means \u201ceverything that\u2019s not in the original set.\u201d \n\nMaybe I\u2019m mixing it up\u2026 I guess the complement could also be the part of the big rectangle that\u2019s **outside** the original set\u2019s circle, and you just shade that outer area. But I think the main idea is you put a smaller circle inside the set and shade the rest to show what\u2019s not in the set. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure which one is right, but I guess you either shade the inside of a tiny circle or the outside of the big one\u2026 sorry!"
