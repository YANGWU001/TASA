      "question": "Explain the process of multiplying two decimals, for example, 1.2 x 0.4.",
      "student_answer": "To multiply two decimals you can follow these three simple steps:\n\n1. **Ignore the decimals and multiply as whole numbers.**  \n   For the example \\(1.2 \\times 0.4\\), remove the decimal points first:  \n   \\[\n   1.2 \\;\\rightarrow\\; 12 \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad 0.4 \\;\\rightarrow\\; 4\n   \\]\n   Multiply the whole numbers: \\(12 \\times 4 = 48\\).\n\n2. **Count how many decimal places there are in the original factors.**  \n   - \\(1.2\\) has **one** decimal place.  \n   - \\(0.4\\) also has **one** decimal place.  \n   Altogether there are \\(1 + 1 = 2\\) decimal places.\n\n3. **Place the decimal point in the product so that the answer has that many decimal places.**  \n   The product from step\u202f1 is 48. Since we need two decimal places, we write the decimal point two spots from the right:\n   \\[\n   48 \\;\\rightarrow\\; 0.48\n   \\]\n\nSo,\n\\[\n1.2 \\times 0.4 = 0.48.\n\\]\n\n**Why this works:**  \nMultiplying the numbers as whole numbers gives the correct magnitude, and then repositioning the decimal point accounts for the factors of 10 that were \u201chidden\u201d when we removed the decimals. The total number of decimal places in the answer is simply the sum of the decimal places in the two original numbers."

      "student_answer": "When you multiply\u202f4.5\u202fby\u202f0.01, the decimal point moves two places to the left (because you\u2019re multiplying by one\u2011hundredth). So  \n\n\\[\n4.5 \\times 0.01 = 0.045.\n\\]"

      "question": "If you multiply 1.8 by 0.4, how many decimal places will be in the product? Why?",
      "student_answer": "The product will have **2 decimal places**.\n\n**Why:**  \n- 1.8 has 1 decimal place.  \n- 0.4 also has 1 decimal place.  \n\nWhen you multiply decimals, the total number of decimal places in the product is the sum of the decimal places in the factors. So \\(1 + 1 = 2\\) decimal places.\n\nIndeed, \\(1.8 \\times 0.4 = 0.72\\), which has two digits to the right of the decimal point."
