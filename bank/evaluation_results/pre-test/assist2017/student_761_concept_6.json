They correctly calculated the perimeter of a triangle, hexagon, and pentagon, but made errors in other calculations and definitions. The student confuses perimeter with area and lacks clarity in explanations.",

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is kind of like the total amount of space inside a shape\u2026 like, you add up all the sides to get the area, I guess? I'm not really sure, but maybe it's the sum of the lengths of the sides, which somehow tells you how much space is inside."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter would be the sum of the three sides, so maybe it's **23\u202fcm**."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... maybe the perimeter is the sum of the four sides, so 4\u202fm\u202f+\u202f4\u202fm\u202f+\u202f4\u202fm\u202f+\u202f4\u202fm \u2026 that would be 12\u202fmeters?  (Not totally sure.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter of a polygon is the total length around the shape, kind of like the \u201cborder\u201d you\u2019d walk if you went all the way around it. The area, on the other hand, is\u2026 I guess it\u2019s also a length measurement? Like you measure the space inside, but it\u2019s still just a regular length, not something squared. So I guess both are measured in the same kind of units, just like meters or something. I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right\u2026"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is probably 30\u202finches."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter works out to be about **20\u202fcm**."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is important because it tells you how much space the garden will have for planting, so you can decide how many rows of vegetables you can fit. It\u2019s not really about the fence itself, but more about the total area inside the rectangle."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter (circumference) of a circle is given by the area formula\u2026 like  \n\n**C\u202f=\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fr\u00b2**  \n\nso for a radius of 7\u202fcm it would be \u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u00b2."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you add them all up: 3\u202f+\u202f5\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f19\u202fcm. So the perimeter would be about **19\u202fcm**."
