  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of equivalent fractions, decimals, and percents, but there are several misconceptions. They correctly identified the percent equivalent of a fraction and the decimal equivalent of a fraction, but made errors in converting fractions to decimals and identifying equivalent values. More practice is needed in converting between these forms accurately.",
