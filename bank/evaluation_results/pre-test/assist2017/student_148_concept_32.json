      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think this triangle **does not** satisfy the triangle inequality.  The rule says the sum of any two sides has to be **greater than** the third side, and when I look at the numbers\u202f3,\u202f4, and\u202f5 it looks like the smallest two sides don\u2019t add up to more than the longest one.  Since\u202f3\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f7, which isn\u2019t \u201cbig enough\u201d compared to\u202f5 (or at least that\u2019s how it seems to me), the inequality fails, so the three lengths can\u2019t form a triangle.  (I\u2019m not completely sure, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the triangle inequality is about the sum of the two shorter sides being\u2026 well, I\u2019m not totally sure. I guess it says the two smaller sides have to add up to something bigger than the biggest side, right? So with sides 2,\u202f3, and\u202f6 you\u2019d check 2\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f5 and compare that to 6. Since 5 is\u2026 actually I think that\u2019s fine? Maybe the rule is that the biggest side just has to be less than or equal to the sum of the other two, and 6 is\u2026 uh\u2026 less than or equal to 5? That doesn\u2019t sound right, but maybe the inequality works the other way around? \n\nIn any case, I\u2019m pretty sure the triangle can\u2019t be drawn because the numbers don\u2019t satisfy whatever the rule is supposed to be. It\u2019s just\u2026 the inequality fails for these lengths, so you can\u2019t make a triangle with 2,\u202f3, and\u202f6. (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% confident about the exact reasoning.)"

So I guess 8\u202f<\u202f7, which means they can\u2019t make a triangle.  \n\nIn other words, the sides 3,\u202f5,\u202fand\u202f7 fail the triangle inequality, so they wouldn\u2019t form a triangle."

      "question": "How can the triangle inequality be used to determine if three given side lengths can form a triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the triangle inequality works kind of the opposite of what we usually hear.  You\u2019re supposed to check that the sum of any two side lengths is **less** than the third side.  So, for side lengths \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), you\u2019d make sure  \n\n\\[\na + b < c,\\qquad a + c < b,\\qquad b + c < a.\n\\]\n\nIf all three of those \u201cless\u2011than\u2019\u2019 statements are true, then the three lengths can make a triangle.  If any one of them fails, then they can\u2019t form a triangle.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about using the triangle inequality to test side lengths."

That\u2019s **equal** to \\(c = 15\\), not greater, so this pair fails the inequality.  \n-\u202f\\(a + c = 7 + 15 = 22\\) which is bigger than \\(b = 10\\); that one is okay.  \n-\u202f\\(b + c = 10 + 15 = 25\\) which is bigger than \\(a = 7\\); that one is also okay.\n\nSince the first condition \\(a + b > c\\) is not true (it\u2019s just equal), the triangle inequality is not satisfied, so I guess these side lengths can\u2019t form a triangle."

Suppose you have towns A, B, and C and you want to drive from A to C.  The triangle inequality would tell you that the distance you travel if you go straight from A to C has to be **longer** than the distance you would travel if you first go from A to B and then from B to C.  So, in this situation you could compare the two possible routes and pick the shorter one (the one that goes through B) because the direct line A\u2011C is supposedly the longest side of the \u201ctriangle.\u201d  \n\nIn other words, you could measure the distances between each pair of towns, check the inequality, and then decide that the route A \u2192 B \u2192 C is the best way to get from A to C.  (I\u2019m not totally sure if I got the inequality the right way round, but I think that\u2019s the idea.)"

      "question": "Why is it impossible for a triangle to have side lengths where one side is longer than the sum of the other two sides?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is that if one side is longer than the other two added together, the other two sides can\u2019t even reach each other to close the shape. Like, the longer side would kind of \u201covershoot\u201d and the endpoints of the shorter sides would be left hanging, so you can\u2019t form a closed figure. I guess it\u2019s also something to do with the angles becoming impossible \u2013 the angle opposite the long side would have to be bigger than 180\u00b0, which just can\u2019t happen in a triangle. So basically the sides wouldn\u2019t meet and you wouldn\u2019t get a proper triangle."
