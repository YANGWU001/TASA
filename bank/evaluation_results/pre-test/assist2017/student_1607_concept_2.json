      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Point\u2011plotting is the basic skill of placing an ordered pair\u202f\\((x,\\;y)\\) on a rectangular coordinate plane.  \nThe usual steps are:\n\n1. **Read the ordered pair** \u2013 identify the first number as the *x\u2011coordinate* (horizontal) and the second as the *y\u2011coordinate* (vertical).  \n2. **Locate the y\u2011value** on the vertical (\u202f*y*\u202f) axis.  \n3. **From that point, move horizontally** until you reach the x\u2011value on the horizontal (\u202f*x*\u202f) axis.  \n4. **Mark the spot** where the two moves intersect; that\u2019s the plotted point.  \n5. (Optional) **Label the point** with its coordinates \\((x,y)\\) and note which quadrant it lies in (I,\u202fII,\u202fIII,\u202fIV) or whether it sits on an axis or at the origin.\n\nIn practice you can also do the steps in the reverse order (first find the x\u2011value, then go up or down to the y\u2011value); the important thing is that the point ends up at the intersection of the correct horizontal and vertical positions."

      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "To find the coordinates of a point on a graph you just read off where the point meets the two axes.\n\n1. **Locate the point** \u2013 Follow a vertical line from the point down to the\u202fx\u2011axis and a horizontal line from the point over to the\u202fy\u2011axis.  \n2. **Read the x\u2011value** \u2013 Where the vertical line hits the x\u2011axis gives the\u202fx\u2011coordinate (the \u201chorizontal\u201d value).  \n3. **Read the y\u2011value** \u2013 Where the horizontal line hits the y\u2011axis gives the\u202fy\u2011coordinate (the \u201cvertical\u201d value).  \n4. **Write the pair** \u2013 Put the numbers in the ordered\u2011pair form \\((x,\\;y)\\).\n\nIf the axes are labeled with a scale (e.g., each grid line =\u202f1 unit), count the number of divisions from the origin to where the lines intersect the axes to get the numerical values. If the point is on a line or curve, you can also use the equation of the line/curve to solve for one coordinate when the other is known, then pair them up the same way."
