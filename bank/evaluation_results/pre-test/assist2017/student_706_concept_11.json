  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of proportions, particularly in real-world applications like recipes and speed calculations. However, many answers reflect confusion about definitions and basic concepts, particularly in distinguishing between ratios and proportions, as well as in calculations.

      "question": "What is the definition of proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a proportion is kind of like a ratio that involves three numbers. Like, you take one number and compare it to two others at the same time\u2014maybe something like \\(a : b = c\\). It\u2019s not really about two fractions being equal; it\u2019s more about relating three quantities together. \n\n(Not completely confident about that.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think proportions work for things like recipes by setting up a ratio between the amount of an ingredient and the number of servings. So you\u2019d write something like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{original amount}}{\\text{original servings}}=\\frac{\\text{new amount}}{\\text{new servings}}.\n\\]\n\nThen you solve for the \u201cnew amount.\u201d  \n\nFor example, if a cake needs 2\u202fcups of flour for 8 servings, and you want to make it for 12 servings, I guess you\u2019d do  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{8}=\\frac{x}{12}.\n\\]\n\nCross\u2011multiplying (I think) gives  \n\n\\[\n2\\cdot12 = 8\\cdot x \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x = \\frac{2\\cdot12}{8}=3.\n\\]\n\nSo you\u2019d need 3\u202fcups of flour.  \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure about the direction of the fraction. Maybe it should be the other way around, like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{original servings}}{\\text{original amount}} = \\frac{\\text{new servings}}{\\text{new amount}},\n\\]\n\nand then you\u2019d solve \\(x = \\frac{8}{2}\\times12 = 48\\) cups, which obviously sounds way too much.\u202fI guess the key idea is to keep the same \u201cratio\u201d between ingredient and servings, even if the numbers get a bit confusing.  \n\nSo, basically, you use a proportion to keep the relationships the same when you scale a recipe up or down. (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% confident I have the formula right, but that\u2019s the general idea.)"

So in 5\u202fhours it would go about  \n\n\\(30 \\text{\u202fmph} \\times 5 \\text{\u202fh} = 150\\)\u202fmiles.  \n\nBut, uh, maybe I\u2019m mixing something up\u2026 could it be more like 120\u202fmiles instead? I\u2019m not really sure."

So if you have the ratios \\(a/b\\) and \\(c/d\\), you\u2019d calculate \\(a \\times c\\) and \\(b \\times d\\). If those two results are equal, then the ratios form a proportion. I guess that\u2019s how you\u2019d check it."
