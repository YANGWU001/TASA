      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the probability of rolling a 6 on a fair six\u2011sided die is about **1/4** (roughly 0.25)."

      "question": "If a coin is flipped twice, what is the probability of getting two heads?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the chance of getting two heads when you flip a coin twice is about 1/2."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between theoretical probability and experimental probability.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, let me try to explain\u2026  \n\nSo, theoretical probability is kind of like the \u201creal\u201d probability that you get from doing the math, right? Like you count all the possible outcomes in a sample space and then you just\u2026 guess the chance. I think you actually just *look* at the numbers and pick the one you think looks right, not really using any formula.  \n\nExperimental probability, on the other hand, is when you *don\u2019t* do any math at all. You just roll a die a bunch of times, or flip a coin, and then you take the *total* number of trials as the probability. Like if you flip a coin 10 times and get heads 7 times, you\u2019d say the experimental probability of heads is 7 (instead of 7/10). I guess you just count the number of times something happened and that\u2019s the probability, without dividing by anything.  \n\nSo basically, theoretical is the \u201cidea\u201d probability you get from thinking about it, and experimental is the \u201cactual\u201d probability you get from just counting things without really doing any calculations. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s exactly right, but\u2026 yeah."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the probability of drawing a red card is... maybe something like 1/4? So, like a 25% chance? I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m guessing."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Describe the concept of mutually exclusive events and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think mutually exclusive events are events that actually have to occur together, like they\u2019re tied to each other.\u202fFor example, when you roll a single six\u2011sided die, getting a 3 and getting a 5 at the same time would be a pair of mutually exclusive events \u2013 because you have to get both numbers together on that one roll.\u202fSo basically, if one thing happens, the other one has to happen too, even though they\u2019re different outcomes."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How can you calculate the probability of two independent events occurring together?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the probability of two independent events happening together is just the sum of their probabilities. So if you have\u202fP(A)\u202f=\u202f0.3 and\u202fP(B)\u202f=\u202f0.5, you\u2019d do\u202f0.3\u202f+\u202f0.5\u202f=\u202f0.8\u202for something like that. Maybe you have to divide by something else, but I think adding is the basic idea."
