However, there was a misunderstanding regarding the roles of x and y coordinates in Question 4, which affected the score.

      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "I think the process of point\u2011plotting on a coordinate plane goes like this: you start with an ordered pair\u202f\\((x,\\;y)\\). First you find the\u202f\\(x\\)\u2011value on the horizontal axis, then you move up (or down) to the\u202f\\(y\\)\u2011value on the vertical axis and put a dot where the two lines meet.\u202fSometimes you can draw a short line from the \\(x\\)-axis upward and another from the \\(y\\)-axis across to help locate the exact spot, then label the point if needed."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "To figure out the coordinates of a point you first **locate the point on the grid** and then read off the two numbers that line up with it.\n\n1. **Find the horizontal position** \u2013 that\u2019s the\u202fx\u2011value.  You look straight over to the x\u2011axis (the line that goes left\u2011right) and see which mark lines up with the point.  \n2. **Find the vertical position** \u2013 that\u2019s the\u202fy\u2011value.  Then you look straight up or down to the y\u2011axis (the line that goes up\u2011and\u2011down) and note the mark that matches the point.  \n\nSo the coordinate is written as \\((x,\u202fy)\\) with the x\u2011value first and the y\u2011value second.  \n\nA couple of extra things to keep in mind (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure about all of them):  \n\n- Make sure you\u2019re using the right **scale** on each axis; sometimes the numbers are spaced differently (e.g., each grid line might be 2\u202funits instead of 1).  \n- If the graph has a **shifted origin** (like the zero point isn\u2019t in the middle), you have to add or subtract that offset from the numbers you read.  \n- Occasionally people label the axes opposite each other (y\u2011axis left\u2011right and x\u2011axis up\u2011down), so double\u2011check the labels \u2013 otherwise you might accidentally swap the numbers.  \n\nIn short, line up the point with the axes, read the horizontal number first, then the vertical number, and write them as \\((x,\u202fy)\\)."

      "student_answer": "Sure, I\u2019ll try to walk through how you would plot the point\u202f(0,\u202f6) and what it means.\n\n1. **Start with a blank coordinate plane.**  \n   The horizontal axis is the *x\u2011axis* and the vertical axis is the *y\u2011axis*. The point where they cross is the origin (0,\u202f0).\n\n2. **Read the coordinates.**  \n   The first number is the *x\u2011value* (how far you move left\u2011right) and the second number is the *y\u2011value* (how far you move up\u2011down).  \n   For (0,\u202f6) the x\u2011value is\u202f0 and the y\u2011value is\u202f6.\n\n3. **Move along the x\u2011axis.**  \n   Since the x\u2011value is\u202f0, you don\u2019t move left or right at all \u2013 you stay right on the y\u2011axis. (In other words, the point will be somewhere on the vertical line that goes through the origin.)\n\n4. **Move along the y\u2011axis.**  \n   From the origin, count up six grid\u2011lines (or units) on the y\u2011axis.  \n   *I think you go six units upward* \u2013 this puts you at the coordinate (0,\u202f6).\n\n5. **Mark the point.**  \n   Put a dot at that location and, if you like, label it \u201c(0,\u202f6)\u201d.\n\n6. **What the result tells you:**  \n   The point lies on the **y\u2011axis** (because the x\u2011coordinate is zero) and it is six units above the origin. This means that for this point the horizontal value is zero \u2013 there\u2019s no left\u2011right displacement \u2013 while the vertical value is positive six.  \n\n   In a real\u2011world context, you could think of it as something that has no horizontal component but a vertical \u201cheight\u201d of\u202f6 units.  \n\n*(One possible slip: sometimes people mistakenly say the point is \u201csix units to the right of the origin,\u201d but that would be true only if the x\u2011value were\u202f6. For (0,\u202f6) the movement is straight up, not to the right.)*"

It represents \u201czero\u201d on both the horizontal and vertical scales, so every other point\u2019s coordinates are measured as a distance away from this reference point.  In other words, the origin is the starting\u2011point for the coordinate system and is used to determine things like distance from the centre and which quadrant a point lies in."

Then you label each axis with the appropriate scale based on the numbers in the table.  \n\nNext, for each pair (x,\u202fy) in the table you locate the x\u2011value along the horizontal axis, move straight up (or down) to the corresponding y\u2011value on the vertical axis, and place a dot at that intersection.  You repeat this for every row in the table.  \n\nFinally, you can check your work by making sure each point matches the numbers in the table, and if the problem asks you to, you might connect the points or draw a line of best fit."
