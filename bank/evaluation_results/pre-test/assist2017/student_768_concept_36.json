  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the sum of interior angles in triangles, but there are significant misconceptions. Answers about the sum of angles and types of triangles are incorrect or confused. The student correctly identifies that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees in some instances, but struggles with related concepts and calculations. A review of basic triangle properties and angle relationships is recommended.",

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the interior angles of any triangle add up to 180 degrees is kind of tied to the fact that each triangle can be split into three right\u2011angles. If you look at a triangle and draw a line from each vertex to the opposite side, you end up with three 90\u2011degree corners, and when you add those together you get 270 degrees. But then you have to subtract the extra 90 degrees that you counted twice, so you get 180 degrees left for the original interior angles.\n\nSo basically, because you can break the triangle into three right angles and then adjust for the double\u2011counting, the sum of the three interior angles ends up being 180 degrees. (At least that\u2019s how I remember it.)"

      "question": "If a triangle has angles measuring 60 degrees, 60 degrees, and 60 degrees, what type of triangle is it?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it's an isosceles triangle\u2026 I'm not entirely sure, but since two of the angles are the same, maybe it\u2019s isosceles."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle actually *can* have interior angles that add up to more than\u202f180\u00b0.  If you draw a triangle on a curved surface\u2014like the surface of a sphere\u2014the angles get a little \u201cstretched\u201d and their sum ends up larger than 180\u00b0.  So in that sense it\u2019s possible for a triangle\u2019s angles to sum to, say, 200\u00b0 or something.  (In flat, Euclidean geometry the sum is exactly 180\u00b0, but on a sphere it can be bigger.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180\u00b0, and a quadrilateral adds up to\u2026 maybe 540\u00b0? So the quadrilateral would have a lot more than the triangle."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the angles in a triangle add up to 180\u00b0, right? So I guess we do 90\u202f+\u202f45\u202f+\u202fx\u202f=\u202f180. If I solve that\u2026 maybe I made a mistake, but I think x would be something like 30\u00b0. I\u2019m not totally sure, though."

      "question": "What is the relationship between the sum of interior angles of a triangle and the exterior angles of a triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the three interior angles of any triangle add up to\u202f180\u00b0, and the three exterior angles also add up to\u202f180\u00b0.  I guess each exterior angle is just the supplement of its adjacent interior angle, so the totals end up being the same."

      "student_answer": "Um, okay, so\u2026 I think you first\u2026 add the two given angles together, right? Then\u2026 I guess you take 180 and\u2026 divide it by that sum? Like, third\u202fangle\u202f=\u202f180\u202f\u00f7\u202f(angle\u2081\u202f+\u202fangle\u2082). \n\nOr maybe\u2026 you\u2019re supposed to subtract the sum from 180? I\u2019m not really sure.  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say:  \n1. Add the two known angles.  \n2. Divide 180 by that total to get the third angle.  \n\nHope that helps\u2026 if not, maybe try the other way around?"
