  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of the Pythagorean Theorem, correctly identifying the formula and its application in some scenarios. However, there are significant misconceptions, particularly in calculations and the understanding of geometric relationships.

      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles is because it\u2019s based on the idea that the two shorter sides are **perpendicular** to each other. When the angle between them is 90\u00b0, the squares of those two sides line up exactly to make a square that has the same area as the square on the longest side.  \n\nIf the angle isn\u2019t a right angle, the two legs aren\u2019t perpendicular, so the squares you draw on them don\u2019t line up the same way and the area\u2011adding trick doesn\u2019t hold.\u202fThat\u2019s why you have to use other rules (like the Law of Cosines) for non\u2011right triangles.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the theorem relies on that right\u2011angle geometry, so it just doesn\u2019t apply when the triangle is, say, obtuse or acute."

      "question": "Prove the Pythagorean Theorem algebraically using a geometric approach.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the algebraic proof goes something like this.  \n\nFirst, let\u2019s take a right\u2011angled triangle with legs \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and hypotenuse \\(c\\).  If we draw a square on each side of the triangle, the areas of those squares are \\(a^{2}\\), \\(b^{2}\\) and \\(c^{2}\\).  The idea is to show that the area of the big square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the two smaller squares.  \n\nOne way to do that is to put four copies of the triangle inside a big square whose side length is \\(a+b\\).  So the big square has area \\((a+b)^{2}\\).  Inside it we see two things: the four triangles (each with area \\(\\frac12ab\\)) and a little square in the middle that\u2019s formed by the hypotenuses.  The area of that little square should be\u2026 I think it\u2019s \\(c^{2}\\), because each side of the little square is the length of the hypotenuse.  \n\nSo we can write the area of the big square as the sum of the areas of the four triangles plus the area of the little square:\n\n\\[\n(a+b)^{2}=4\\left(\\frac12ab\\right)+c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side gives \\(a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}\\).  The right side simplifies to \\(2ab+c^{2}\\).  If we subtract \\(2ab\\) from both sides we get  \n\n\\[\na^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nThat\u2019s the Pythagorean theorem, right?  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure about the step where the little middle shape is a square of side \\(c\\); maybe it\u2019s actually a rectangle or something else, but\u2026 I think this is the geometric\u2011algebraic proof.  Sorry if any part is off."
