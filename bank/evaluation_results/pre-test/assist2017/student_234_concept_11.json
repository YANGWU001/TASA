In other words, it shows that the relationship between one pair of numbers is the same as the relationship between another pair, often written in the form  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{c}{d}\n\\]\n\nor \u201c\\(a\\) is to \\(b\\) as \\(c\\) is to \\(d\\).\u201d"

      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Proportions are a handy way to keep the relationships between quantities the same while changing the overall size of a problem.  \nIn a recipe the ingredients are linked by a fixed ratio: the amount of flour, sugar, butter, etc., all increase (or decrease) together so that the taste and texture stay consistent.  \n\n### How it works  \n1. **Identify the base ratio.**  \n   Look at the original recipe and note how much of each ingredient is used for a given number of servings. For example, a cake might call for  \n\n   * 2\u202fcups flour  \n   * 1\u202fcup sugar  \n   * \u00bd\u202fcup butter  \n\n   to make **4 servings**.\n\n2. **Decide the new size.**  \n   Suppose you need **6 servings** instead of 4.\n\n3. **Find the scaling factor.**  \n   The scaling factor is the ratio of the new number of servings to the original number:  \n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Scaling factor} = \\frac{6\\text{ servings}}{4\\text{ servings}} = 1.5\n   \\]\n\n4. **Apply the factor to every ingredient.**  \n   Multiply each original amount by 1.5:  \n\n   * Flour: \\(2 \\text{\u202fcups} \\times 1.5 = 3 \\text{\u202fcups}\\)  \n   * Sugar: \\(1 \\text{\u202fcup} \\times 1.5 = 1.5 \\text{\u202fcups}\\)  \n   * Butter: \\(0.5 \\text{\u202fcup} \\times 1.5 = 0.75 \\text{\u202fcup}\\)\n\n   This keeps the proportions exactly the same, just on a larger scale.\n\n### Why using a proportion is better than \u201cguessing\u201d  \nIf you simply doubled everything because you needed \u201cmore\u201d cake, you\u2019d end up with 8 servings instead of 6, and the cake could turn out too rich or too dry. By setting up the proportion \\(\\frac{\\text{new servings}}{\\text{old servings}} = \\frac{\\text{new amount}}{\\text{old amount}}\\) and solving for the unknown (the new amount), you guarantee that every ingredient stays in the correct ratio.\n\n### A quick tip  \nWhen the scaling factor isn\u2019t a tidy number, you can still use the proportion. For example, to go from 4 servings to 7 servings, the factor is \\(\\frac{7}{4}=1.75\\); just multiply each ingredient by 1.75 and you\u2019ll have a correctly\u2011scaled recipe.\n\nIn short, writing the relationship as a proportion (old\u202f:\u202fnew = old amount\u202f:\u202fnew amount) lets you solve for any missing quantity, ensuring the recipe scales up or down while preserving its intended flavor and texture."

      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "A **ratio** is simply a way of comparing two quantities by stating how many times one value contains another.  \nFor example, the ratio of 8\u202fcm to 2\u202fcm can be written as \\(8:2\\) or \\(\\frac{8}{2}=4\\).\n\nA **proportion** occurs when two ratios are set equal to each other; it shows that two pairs of quantities have the same relative relationship.  \nFor example, \\(\\frac{8}{2} = \\frac{12}{3}\\) is a proportion because the two ratios \\(8:2\\) and \\(12:3\\) are equivalent (both equal 4).\n\nIn short:  \n- **Ratio** \u2013 a single comparison of two numbers.  \n- **Proportion** \u2013 a statement that two ratios are equal.  \n\nSo a proportion is essentially an equality of two ratios, while a ratio is just one comparative statement."

      "student_answer": "Cross\u2011multiplication is a quick way to test whether two ratios are equal, i.e., whether they form a proportion.  \n\nSuppose the two ratios are  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\frac{c}{d}.\n\\]\n\nTo check if \\(\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{c}{d}\\) you:\n\n1. Multiply the numerator of the first ratio by the denominator of the second (\u202f\\(a \\times d\\)\u202f).  \n2. Multiply the denominator of the first ratio by the numerator of the second (\u202f\\(b \\times c\\)\u202f).  \n\nIf the two products are the same,  \n\n\\[\na \\times d \\;=\\; b \\times c,\n\\]\n\nthen the two ratios are equivalent and they indeed form a proportion. If the products differ, the ratios are not in proportion. This works because the equality \\(\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{c}{d}\\) can be rewritten by cross\u2011multiplying to the equivalent statement \\(ad = bc\\)."
