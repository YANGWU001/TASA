      "question": "Explain the process of multiplying two decimals, for example, 1.2 x 0.4.",
      "student_answer": "To multiply two decimals you basically treat them like whole numbers first, do the multiplication, and then put the decimal point back in the right place.\n\n1. **Ignore the decimals and multiply**  \n   For\u202f\\(1.2 \\times 0.4\\) you can rewrite the numbers without the decimal points:  \n   \\(1.2 \u2192 12\\) and \\(0.4 \u2192 4\\).  \n   Multiply those whole numbers:  \n   \\[\n   12 \\times 4 = 48.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Count how many decimal places the original numbers had**  \n   -\u202f\\(1.2\\) has **one** digit after the decimal.  \n   -\u202f\\(0.4\\) also has **one** digit after the decimal.  \n   Adding them together gives **two** decimal places total.\n\n3. **Place the decimal point in the product**  \n   The raw product we got was\u202f48. Since we need two decimal places, we move the decimal point two spots from the right:  \n   \\[\n   48 \\;\\rightarrow\\; 0.48.\n   \\]\n\nSo the result of \\(1.2 \\times 0.4\\) is **0.48**.\n\n*(I think this is the usual way; sometimes people also think of it as \u201cmultiply as if they were whole numbers and then divide by 10 for each decimal place,\u201d which would give the same answer \u2013 divide 48 by 100 (because there are two decimal places) to get 0.48.)*"

      "student_answer": "When you multiply\u202f4.5\u202fby\u202f0.01, you\u2019re essentially shifting the decimal point two places to the left. So\n\n\\[\n4.5 \\times 0.01 = 0.045\n\\]\n\nI think the decimal point moves two spots left, giving\u202f0.045."

      "student_answer": "I think the product is **0.0054**.\n\n**How I got that:**  \n\n1. First I looked at the numbers\u202f0.09 and\u202f0.6.  \n2. I multiplied the whole\u2011number parts:\u202f9\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f54.  \n3. Because both original numbers are decimals, I moved the decimal point two places to the left (one place for each factor).  \n4. Moving the decimal two places left of\u202f54 gives\u202f0.0054.  \n\nSo, 0.09\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.6\u202f\u2248\u202f0.0054. (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure\u2014but that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "question": "If you multiply 1.8 by 0.4, how many decimal places will be in the product? Why?",
      "student_answer": "I think the product will have **one decimal place**.  \n\nSince 1.8 has one decimal place and 0.4 also has one decimal place, we usually just keep the larger of the two counts. So the result (which would be around\u202f0.7) should be written with one decimal digit."
