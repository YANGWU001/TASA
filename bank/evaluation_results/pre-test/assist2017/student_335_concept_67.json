      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think\u202f2/3 is larger than\u202f3/4.  \n\nMy reasoning is kind of shaky, but here\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking: if you compare the two fractions by looking at the numbers on the bottom, the denominator 3 is smaller than the denominator 4, so the fraction with the smaller denominator should be bigger, right? And the numerators 2 and 3 are pretty close, so I guess the size is mostly decided by the denominator. Since 3\u202f<\u202f4, I\u2019m guessing 2/3 is the bigger one.  \n\n(\u2026but I\u2019m not totally sure.)"
