      "student_answer": "Um, I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is kind of like when you take a percentage and use it to find a part of some other number.  It\u2019s like you\u2019re saying \u201cwhat is this fraction of something else?\u201d  So you\u2019d change the percent to a decimal and then\u2026 well, you sort of multiply it by the other number, I guess.\n\nFor example, if you wanted to find 20\u202f% of 50, you\u2019d (I think) change 20\u202f% to 0.20 and then do 0.20\u202f\u00d7\u202f50, which gives you about 15.  So 20\u202f% of 50 would be 15.  (I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s exactly right, but that\u2019s how I understand it.)"
