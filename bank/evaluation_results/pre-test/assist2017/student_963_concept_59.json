      "question": "Explain the difference between permutations and combinations in your own words.",
      "student_answer": "**Permutations vs. Combinations**\n\n- **Permutations** are arrangements where the **order matters**.  \n  If you pick a set of objects and then line them up, each different ordering counts as a separate permutation.  \n  *Example:* From the letters\u202fA,\u202fB,\u202fC, the permutations of 2 letters are AB,\u202fBA,\u202fAC,\u202fCA,\u202fBC,\u202fCB \u2013 six of them.\n\n- **Combinations** are selections where the **order does *not* matter**.  \n  You only care about which objects are chosen, not how they are arranged.  \n  *Example:* From the same letters\u202fA,\u202fB,\u202fC, the combinations of 2 letters are AB,\u202fAC,\u202fBC \u2013 only three of them.\n\nIn short, permutations count distinct **orderings** of a set, while combinations count distinct **subsets** regardless of order. The formulas reflect this:  \n- Permutations of *n* items taken *r* at a time: \\(P(n,r)=\\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}\\).  \n- Combinations of *n* items taken *r* at a time: \\(C(n,r)=\\binom{n}{r}= \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\\).  \n\nSo the key difference is whether the arrangement\u2019s sequence is important (permutations) or not (combinations)."

      "student_answer": "**Example:**  \nA movie theater wants to assign seats to the\u202f8\u202fpeople who have bought tickets for a particular showing. The manager needs to decide **which specific seat each person will sit in** (e.g.,\u202fSeat\u202fA\u20111,\u202fA\u20112,\u202fA\u20113, \u2026).\n\n**Why permutations, not combinations:**  \n- **Order matters.**\u202fPerson\u202fA in seat\u202fA\u20111 and Person\u202fB in seat\u202fA\u20112 is a different arrangement from Person\u202fA in seat\u202fA\u20112 and Person\u202fB in seat\u202fA\u20111. The specific ordering of people in the seats changes the outcome, so we must count each distinct ordering.\n- **No \u201cselection\u2011only\u201d situation.**\u202fIf we were merely choosing a group of\u202f8\u202fpeople from a larger pool to attend the movie, we would use combinations (order wouldn\u2019t matter). Here, we are **arranging** those\u202f8\u202fpeople in a set of\u202f8\u202fdistinct seats, so the number of possible outcomes is a permutation:  \n\n\\[\nP(8,8)=8! = 40\\,320\n\\]\n\nThus, permutations are appropriate because we care about the exact sequence (or placement) of the individuals, not just which individuals are chosen."

      "question": "Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, how would you calculate the number of outcomes that satisfy at least one of two conditions?",
      "student_answer": "To count the outcomes that meet **at least one** of two conditions (let\u2019s call the sets of outcomes that satisfy the conditions \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)), you use the inclusion\u2011exclusion principle for two sets:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\;|A\\cup B| \\;=\\; |A| \\;+\\; |B| \\;-\\; |A\\cap B|\\;}\n\\]\n\n**Why this works**\n\n1. **Add \\(|A|\\) and \\(|B|\\):** This counts every outcome that satisfies condition\u202f\\(A\\) and every outcome that satisfies condition\u202f\\(B\\).  \n2. **Subtract \\(|A\\cap B|\\):** Outcomes that satisfy **both** conditions have been counted twice (once in \\(|A|\\) and once in \\(|B|\\)). Subtracting the size of the intersection removes the double\u2011count, leaving each outcome counted exactly once.\n\nSo, to find the number of outcomes that satisfy **at least one** of the two conditions, compute the size of each individual set, compute the size of their intersection, and plug them into the formula above."
