      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the mean is found by adding up all the numbers and then **multiplying** by how many numbers there are. So the formula would be something like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Mean} = \\big(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i\\big) \\times N\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between the mean and the median in statistical analysis.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, I think the mean and the median are kind of the same thing, but there\u2019s a small difference. The mean is actually the middle value of a data set when you line everything up in order, while the median is the average you get by adding up all the numbers and dividing by how many there are. So, basically, the mean tells you the \u201ccentral\u201d data point, and the median tells you the overall \u201caverage\u201d of the data. The mean is less affected by extreme values, while the median can get pulled around a lot if you have outliers. \n\nIn practice, you\u2019d use the mean when you want the middle value and the median when you want a quick calculation of the total."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Why is the mean considered a measure of central tendency?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the mean is called a measure of central tendency because it actually gives you the middle number in the data set, kind of like the median.\u202fWhen you add everything up and divide by the number of items, you end up with the value that sits right in the center of the list, so it tells you where the data are centered.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s why the mean is used to describe the \u201ccenter\u201d of the data."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does adding an outlier to a data set affect the mean?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think adding an outlier to a data set doesn\u2019t really change the mean much.\u2011\u2011the average kind of stays about the same because the other numbers balance it out, so the outlier\u2019s effect is pretty minimal."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Provide an example where the mean might not be the best measure of central tendency.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe the mean is actually the best in most cases, but if I had to pick an example where it\u2019s not, I guess\u2026 let\u2019s say you have a set of test scores like 10, 10, 10, 10, and 100. The mean would be (10+10+10+10+100)/5 = 28, right? And that 28 is actually a good representation of the \u201caverage\u201d performance because it balances the low scores and the one high score. So, I guess that\u2019s an example where the mean works fine\u2026? \n\nWait, I think I messed that up. Maybe the mean actually isn\u2019t the best here because most students scored 10 and only one got 100, so the median (which would be 10) might be better. But\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure which one is correct. \n\nSo, my example is a data set with a big outlier, like [10,\u202f10,\u202f10,\u202f10,\u202f100]; the mean (28) isn\u2019t the best measure because it\u2019s pulled up by the outlier, and the median (10) would be more representative. Sorry if that\u2019s not right."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the fifth number might be **5**.  \n(I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I get when I try to work it out.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where calculating the mean would be useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011life situation where you\u2019d use the mean is when you want to find the most common shoe size in a class. You\u2019d add up all the shoe sizes that the students wear and then divide by the number of students, and that gives you the \u201caverage\u201d shoe size, which tells you which size appears most often. So if you have sizes 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, you\u2019d add them together and divide by five, and you\u2019d get the mean shoe size. That way the school can order the right amount of shoes. I'm not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s how you\u2019d use the mean in real life."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "True or False: The mean is always equal to one of the values in the data set. Explain your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s **True** that the mean is always equal to one of the values in the data set.  \n\nI guess the reason is that when you add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are, you end up with a number that must be one of the original numbers, because you\u2019re just \u201csplitting\u201d the total evenly among the items. So the average ends up being exactly one of the data points every time."
