      "question": "Explain the process of multiplying two decimals, for example, 1.2 x 0.4.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you just treat the decimals like whole numbers first. So for 1.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.4 you\u2019d ignore the points and multiply 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f4, which gives 48. Then you count the total number of decimal places in the original numbers \u2013 I guess that\u2019s just one because 0.4 has one decimal place (and I\u2019m not really sure if we count the 1.2 too). So you move the decimal one place to the left in 48 and get **4.8** as the product. \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about the decimal\u2011place rule, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 let me see\u2026 0.85 dollars times 12\u2026 maybe it\u2019s around\u202f$9.80?  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that sounds about right."

      "question": "What happens to the decimal point when multiplying 4.5 by 0.01?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the decimal point just moves one place to the left when you multiply 4.5 by\u202f0.01, so the product would be about **0.45**.  (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Calculate 0.09 x 0.6 and explain each step.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the product is **0.54**.\n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step (as I understand it):**\n\n1. First I ignore the decimals and multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers:  \n   \\(9 \\times 6 = 54\\).\n\n2. Then I try to put the decimal point back.  \n   Since 0.09 has two decimal places and 0.6 has one, I thought I needed to move the decimal **one** place to the left in the result (because 0.6 only has one decimal).  \n\n3. So I move the decimal one place left in 54, giving 5.4, and then I think I need to add a zero in front to keep the format, ending up with **0.54**.\n\n4. Therefore, \\(0.09 \\times 0.6 = 0.54\\).\n\nI\u2019m not completely sure about the decimal\u2011place rule, but that\u2019s how I got the answer."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the product will have **one** decimal place.\u202fI guess when you multiply you usually just keep the decimal places of the first number, so 1.8\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.4 would give something like 0.7 (one decimal)."
