      "question": "What is the definition of proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a proportion is just a way of writing a single ratio, like \u201c3\u202fto\u202f4\u201d, you know, the numbers that go together. It\u2019s kind of the same as a fraction, but not really an equation that says two ratios are equal. Basically it\u2019s just the relationship between the two numbers."

      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the idea is you write a proportion that compares the original amount of each ingredient to the new amount you want.\u202fFor example, if a recipe calls for 2\u202fcups of flour to make 4\u202fservings, and you want to make 8\u202fservings, you could set up a proportion like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{2\\text{ cups}}{4\\text{ servings}} = \\frac{x\\text{ cups}}{8\\text{ servings}}\n\\]\n\nand then solve for\u202f\\(x\\).\u202fYou\u2019d cross\u2011multiply and get \\(2 \\times 8 = 4x\\), so \\(x = 4\\) cups of flour.  \n\nSo basically you just double every ingredient because you doubled the number of servings.\u202fYou do the same thing for the other ingredients, and you\u2019ve \u201cscaled\u201d the recipe.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you also have to keep the cooking time the same, right?\u202fAnd if the original recipe was for a 9\u2011inch pan, you could use a proportion to figure out what size pan you need for a larger batch\u2014like maybe a 12\u2011inch pan\u2014by comparing the areas.\u202fI guess you\u2019d do something like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{9^2}{\\text{original amount}} = \\frac{12^2}{\\text{new amount}}\n\\]\n\nand solve for the new amount.\u202fThat way the dish still cooks evenly.  \n\nUm, basically proportions let you keep the same \u201cratios\u201d of ingredients and other things while you change the overall size of the recipe."

      "question": "If a car travels 60 miles in 2 hours, what is the proportional distance it would travel in 5 hours?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... the car\u2019s speed is 60\u202fmiles \u00f7\u202f2\u202fhours = 30\u202fmph.  So in 5\u202fhours it would go about 30\u202fmiles\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f150\u202fmiles.  Wait, actually\u2026 I\u2019m not sure\u2014maybe it\u2019s just 30\u202fmiles total?  I think the proportional distance would be **30 miles**."

      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think a ratio is just a pair of numbers that are equal to each other\u2014like 5\u202f:\u202f5 means the two amounts are the same. A proportion, on the other hand, is kind of like a fraction, something like 2\u20443, that tells you how one part relates to the whole. So I guess ratios compare two things that are the same, and proportions are fractions that show part\u2011of\u2011a\u2011whole relationships. (Sorry if that\u2019s off\u2026)"

      "question": "How can cross-multiplication be used to determine if two ratios form a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think cross\u2011multiplication works by just multiplying the two numerators together and also multiplying the two denominators together, and then you compare those two results. So if  \n\n\\[\n\\text{(first numerator)} \\times \\text{(second numerator)} \\;=\\; \\text{(first denominator)} \\times \\text{(second denominator)},\n\\]\n\nthen the two ratios are a proportion. If the products aren\u2019t the same, they don\u2019t form a proportion.  \n\n(That\u2019s what I remember from class, but I\u2019m not totally sure.)"
