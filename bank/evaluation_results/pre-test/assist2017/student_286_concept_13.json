The student should focus on accurately identifying slopes and intercepts, as well as the characteristics of parallel lines.

      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think the slope of a line on a graph is the point where the line crosses the\u202fx\u2011axis.  In other words, it tells you the x\u2011intercept of the line."

      "question": "How can you determine the y-intercept from the linear equation y = mx + b?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you find the y\u2011intercept by setting\u202fy\u202fto\u202f0 and solving for\u202fx. The value you get for\u202fx\u202fin that case is the y\u2011intercept. (So you just plug\u202f0\u202fin for\u202fy\u202fand solve\u202f0 = mx + b.)"

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think two linear equations are parallel when they actually share the same\u202fy\u2011intercept. Like, they cross the y\u2011axis at the same point, so they kind of line up next to each other and never meet. I'm not totally sure, but that's what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell if the slope is positive or negative just by looking at where the line crosses the axes. If the y\u2011intercept is above the x\u2011axis (so the line starts high) and the x\u2011intercept is to the right of the y\u2011axis, then the line must be going down, so I guess that means a negative slope. And if the y\u2011intercept is below the x\u2011axis and the line hits the x\u2011axis on the left side, then it\u2019s going up, so that would be a positive slope.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe you can also look at the direction the line points: if it points toward the upper\u2011right corner of the graph it\u2019s positive, and if it points toward the lower\u2011right corner it\u2019s negative.  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s a bit mixed up!"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the y\u2011intercept is the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis, right? So I guess it would be at\u202f(0,\u202f5)\u202f\u2013 that\u2019s the \u201c5\u201d from the 5x term. On the graph it would show up where the line meets the vertical y\u2011axis at that point. (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d first write the linear equation in the form\u202fy\u202f=\u202fmx\u202f+\u202fb.\u202fThen, for each new x\u2011value you just plug it into the equation, multiply by the slope\u202fm, and\u2026 uh\u2026 add the y\u2011intercept\u202fb to get the predicted y. \n\nSo, for example, if the equation were\u202fy\u202f=\u202f2x\u202f+\u202f3\u202fand you wanted the value when\u202fx\u202f=\u202f5, you\u2019d do\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f10, then \u201cadd\u201d the intercept, which I guess means you subtract\u202f3, giving\u202fy\u202f\u2248\u202f7. \n\n(Or maybe you\u2019re supposed to add the intercept\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the coefficients kinda work like this: the bigger the number in front of the\u202f*x*\u202fterm, the steeper the line gets\u2014so if the coefficient is large, the line is really slanted. And, uh, the constant term (the one without\u202f*x*) also kind of changes how steep it is, like if that number is bigger the line looks\u2026 steeper too. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
