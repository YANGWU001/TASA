  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of transversals and their properties, but there are significant misconceptions, particularly regarding angle relationships. The definitions and relationships need clarification, especially concerning corresponding and supplementary angles. The student should focus on the correct definitions and properties of angles formed by transversals intersecting parallel lines.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is a transversal in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a transversal is a line that\u2019s parallel to two other lines, kind of like it runs alongside them instead of crossing them."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, how many angles are formed at the points of intersection?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there are probably **four** angles in total formed where the transversal meets the two parallel lines."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Define the relationship between corresponding angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that when a transversal crosses two parallel lines, the corresponding angles are\u202fsupplementary\u202f\u2013 they add up to 180 degrees."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the alternate interior angles by looking at the two angles that are **on the same side of the transversal and between the two parallel lines**. So when the transversal cuts the parallel lines, you just pick the two angles that sit in the interior region and are on the same side of the transversal\u2014those are the alternate interior angles. (Usually they end up being equal.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal crossing two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the interior angles add up to about **360\u202fdegrees**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a ladder leaning against a wall is a good real\u2011world example of a transversal. The side of the ladder would intersect the two \u201cparallel\u201d lines of the wall and the floor, so you can see the corresponding angles and stuff.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure\u2014maybe that\u2019s not the best example, but I think it works?)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is just a line that cuts across two other lines. When those two lines happen to be parallel, the transversal makes a bunch of angles at the intersection points.  \n\nSo, like, the angles that are **on the same side of the transversal and between the two parallel lines** \u2013 those are called interior\u2011same\u2011side angles \u2013 and I think they add up to 180\u00b0, so they\u2019re supplementary.  \n\nI also remember something about the **alternate interior angles** being supplementary too, but I\u2019m not totally sure; maybe they\u2019re equal instead?  \n\nAnd the **corresponding angles** \u2013 I guess those might be supplementary as well, because they\u2019re kind of \u201cacross\u201d from each other, right?  \n\nSo, in short, a transversal creates pairs of angles that sum to 180\u00b0 when the lines it crosses are parallel, especially the interior\u2011same\u2011side ones, and maybe some of the other ones too.  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not exactly right\u2026 I\u2019m still a bit fuzzy on which pairs are equal versus supplementary."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the difference is kind of\u2026 well, both are about where the angles are when a transversal cuts two lines, but\u2026 \n\nAlternate **interior** angles are the ones that are on the inside of the two lines but on opposite sides of the transversal. So, like, you look at the region between the two lines and pick the pair that\u2019s across the transversal from each other.  \n\nAlternate **exterior** angles, I guess, are the ones that are on the outside of the two lines, also on opposite sides of the transversal. So you\u2019d look at the outer region and pick the pair that\u2019s across the transversal.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the main thing is that interior are inside the parallel lines and exterior are outside them. Maybe the names just tell you whether the angles are inside or outside the lines."

      "question": "Solve for x: A transversal intersects two parallel lines, creating one angle measuring 70\u00b0. What is the measure of its corresponding angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the corresponding angle would be different. Since the lines are parallel, the angle across the transversal should add up to 180\u00b0, so maybe the corresponding angle is **110\u00b0**. (I'm not totally sure.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think vertical angles are equal because they\u2019re kind of \u201cmirrored\u201d across the transversal.\u202fWhen two lines cross, the angles that sit opposite each other share the same lines, so they end up having the same size.\u202fI guess it\u2019s because the transversal kind of splits the two intersecting lines into two congruent halves, so the opposite corners have to be equal.\u202fMaybe it\u2019s also related to the fact that the lines are parallel, so the angles on either side have to match up?\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."
