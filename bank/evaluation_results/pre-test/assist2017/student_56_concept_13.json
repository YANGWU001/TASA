      "question": "What does the slope in a linear equation represent in the context of a graph?",
      "student_answer": "The slope of a linear equation tells you how steep the line is and how the\u202f\\(y\\)-value changes as the\u202f\\(x\\)-value changes.  In other words, it is the \u201crate of change\u2019\u2019 or\u202f\\( \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}} \\); a positive slope means the line rises as you move to the right, a negative slope means it falls, and a larger absolute value means a steeper incline."

In other words, the y\u2011intercept is the value of \\(y\\) when \\(x = 0\\), and it is directly read off as the \u201c+\u202fb\u201d part of the equation."

      "student_answer": "Two linear equations are **parallel** when their graphs are straight lines that never intersect. This happens exactly when the lines have the **same slope** but **different y\u2011intercepts** (i.e., the constant terms are not the same). In algebraic form, if the equations are written as  \n\n\\[\ny = m_1x + b_1 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad y = m_2x + b_2,\n\\]\n\nthey are parallel when  \n\n\\[\nm_1 = m_2 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad b_1 \\neq b_2.\n\\]\n\nBecause the slopes are equal, the lines run in the same direction, and because the intercepts differ, they remain distinct and never meet."

      "student_answer": "When \\(x = 4\\),\n\n\\[\ny = -2(4) + 3 = -8 + 3 = -5.\n\\]\n\nSo the y\u2011value is \\(\\boxed{-5}\\)."

      "student_answer": "To tell whether the slope of a line is **positive** or **negative** just look at how the line runs from left to right on the coordinate\u2011plane.\n\n1. **Pick two points** on the line (or just mentally follow the line).  \n2. **Notice the direction** as you move from the left\u2011hand side of the graph toward the right\u2011hand side:\n\n| Direction from left \u2192 right | What it means for the slope |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| The line **goes up** (the y\u2011value increases) | **Positive slope** \u2013 the line is rising |\n| The line **goes down** (the y\u2011value decreases) | **Negative slope** \u2013 the line is falling |\n| The line stays **level** (horizontal) | **Zero slope** \u2013 the line is neither positive nor negative (it\u2019s flat) |\n\nSo, on a typical graph:\n\n* If you start at a point on the left side and you see the line climbing toward the top as you move to the right, the slope is positive.  \n* If the line descends toward the bottom as you move to the right, the slope is negative.  \n\nA **horizontal line** has a slope of zero; it doesn\u2019t tilt upward or downward, so we treat it as neither positive nor negative (it\u2019s just flat).  \n\nIn short, the sign of the slope is determined by whether the line rises (positive) or falls (negative) as you go from left to right."

      "student_answer": "The equation is written in slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\).  \n\n- The constant term \\(b\\) is the **y\u2011intercept**.  \n- Here \\(b = 7\\).\n\nSo the line crosses the y\u2011axis at the point **\\((0,\\;7)\\)**. On a graph this is the point where the line meets the vertical (y) axis; you would plot the point (0,\u202f7) and draw the line through it with a slope of 5 (rising 5 units for each 1 unit you move to the right)."

      "student_answer": "To predict\u202f\\(y\\)\u202ffrom a linear equation you simply **solve for\u202f\\(y\\)** and then plug the desired\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fvalues into that formula.  \nThe generic form of a straight\u2011line relationship is  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b\n\\]\n\nwhere  \n\n* **\\(m\\)** is the slope (the change in\u202f\\(y\\)\u202ffor each one\u2011unit change in\u202f\\(x\\)), and  \n* **\\(b\\)** is the\u202f*y\u2011intercept* (the value of\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fwhen\u202f\\(x = 0\\)).  \n\n**Steps to make a prediction**\n\n1. **Identify\u202f\\(m\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(b\\).**  \n   If the equation is already in the form\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\)\u202fyou can read them straight off.  \n   If the equation is given in another form (e.g.,\u202f\\(2x + 3y = 6\\)), rearrange it to solve for\u202f\\(y\\):\n   \\[\n   3y = -2x + 6 \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; y = -\\frac{2}{3}x + 2\n   \\]\n   So here\u202f\\(m = -\\frac{2}{3}\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(b = 2\\).\n\n2. **Substitute the chosen\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fvalue(s).**  \n   For each new\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fyou want to predict, replace\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fin the formula with that number.  \n\n   *Example*: Using the equation \\(y = 4x - 5\\) and wanting the value at \\(x = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   y = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Compute the result.**  \n   Carry out the arithmetic to get the predicted \\(y\\).  \n\n4. **Interpret the prediction.**  \n   The resulting \\(y\\) is the estimated response (or outcome) that the linear model says should occur when \\(x\\) takes the specified value.\n\n**Quick tip:** Because the relationship is linear, you can also use the slope\u2011intercept idea directly: \u201cstarting from the intercept\u202f\\(b\\), move up (or down) by\u202f\\(m\\)\u202funits for each unit you move to the right in\u202f\\(x\\).\u201d This visual notion often helps avoid arithmetic slips.\n\nSo, in short: write the equation in the form \\(y = mx + b\\), plug in your new \\(x\\) values, do the calculation, and the resulting numbers are your predicted \\(y\\) values."
