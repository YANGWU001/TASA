  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the order of operations, particularly with the concept of parentheses and their function. However, there are significant misunderstandings in calculations and the order of operations, especially regarding multiplication and addition. The student should focus on practicing the correct application of PEMDAS and double-checking their calculations.",

After that I added the 8 at the beginning, so 8\u202f+\u202f16\u202f=\u202f24, and then I subtracted 4, which I think gives 22. \n\n(Not totally sure, though\u2026)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain why parentheses are used in mathematical expressions when applying the order of operations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think parentheses are mainly there to tell us which part of a calculation we have to do first. Like, when you see something inside (\u202f), you\u2019re supposed to work out everything inside those brackets before you move on to the other operations outside, so they basically set the order of operations.  \n\nThey also group numbers together so you can treat a whole chunk as a single unit \u2013 for example, in\u202f\\(3\u202f\u00d7\u202f(2\u202f+\u202f5)\\) you add 2\u202f+\u202f5 first because the parentheses say \u201cdo this part first,\u201d then you multiply by 3.  \n\nI guess another reason is that they can be used to make the expression look nicer or to separate parts of a problem, but the main point is that they force you to evaluate what\u2019s inside first, which overrides the usual PEMDAS/\u200bBODMAS rules for those parts.  \n\nSo, basically, parentheses are like little \u201cdo\u2011this\u2011first\u201d signs that help avoid confusion and make sure we get the right answer."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the result is **12**.\n\n**My steps (I might have mixed something up):**\n\n1. First I did the addition inside the expression:  \n   \\(3 + 4 = 7\\)\n\n2. Then I multiplied that sum by 2 (I think multiplication comes next):  \n   \\(7 \\times 2 = 14\\)\n\n3. I handled the parentheses next:  \n   \\(6 \u00f7 3 = 2\\)\n\n4. Finally I subtracted the result of the parentheses from the product:  \n   \\(14 - 2 = 12\\)\n\nSo, I\u2019m guessing the whole expression \\(3 + 4 * 2 - (6 / 3)\\) equals **12**.  \n\n*(Sorry if I messed up the order\u2014I'm still a bit shaky on the rules.)*"

In other words, the multiplication step is off, not the order\u2011of\u2011operations."
