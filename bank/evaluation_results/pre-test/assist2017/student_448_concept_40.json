      "student_answer": "I think division is when you take a number and split it into a certain number of equal parts.\u202fThe number you start with is the dividend, and the number of parts you want is the divisor, and the answer you get\u2014called the quotient\u2014is how many pieces you end up with in each group.\u202fIn other words, it\u2019s kind of the opposite of multiplication, because if multiplication means \u201chow many total if you have this many groups of this size,\u201d division tells you \u201chow many groups or how big each group is\u201d when you know the total.\u202fSometimes I get mixed up and think the divisor is the result, but actually it\u2019s the number of groups you\u2019re dividing into.\u202fSo basically division is sharing or grouping something evenly."

      "student_answer": "One simple way to verify a division result is to \u201cundo\u201d the division with multiplication:\n\n1. **Multiply the quotient by the divisor.**  \n   If the division was exact, the product should be exactly the original dividend.\n\n2. **If there was a remainder, add it back.**  \n   For example, if you computed\u202f`73 \u00f7 8 = 9\u202fR\u202f1`, then  \n   `9\u202f\u00d7\u202f8 = 72` and `72\u202f+\u202f1 = 73`, which matches the original number.\n\nIf the product (plus any remainder) isn\u2019t the same as the number you started with, something went wrong with the division.\n\nA quick \u201cestimate\u201d check can also help \u2013 make sure the quotient is in the right ballpark (e.g., 50 \u00f7 5 should be around 10, not 100). If the result feels way off, double\u2011check the calculation."

      "student_answer": "**Real\u2011life scenario**\n\nA group of friends orders a large pizza that is cut into 12 equal slices. They are 5 people, and they want to share the pizza as evenly as possible. How many whole slices does each person get, and how many slices are left over?\n\n**How to solve it (using division)**  \n\n1. **Set up the division** \u2013 total slices \u00f7 number of people  \n   \\(12 \\div 5\\).\n\n2. **Do the calculation** \u2013 I think the result is about 2.4 slices per person.  \n   So each friend can take **2 whole slices**.  \n\n3. **Find the remainder** \u2013 Multiply the whole\u2011slice amount by the number of people:  \n   \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) slices used.  \n   Subtract from the total: \\(12 - 10 = 2\\) slices left over.\n\n**Answer**  \n- Each friend gets **2 whole slices** of pizza.  \n- There are **2 slices left** that can be split later (or saved for later).  \n\n---\n\n**Another quick example (just for practice)**  \n\nIf a teacher has 23 crayons and wants to give the same number to each of 4 students, she would divide 23 by 4.  \nI think the division gives about 5.75, so each student gets **5 crayons** and there would be **3 crayons** left over (because \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\) and \\(23 - 20 = 3\\)).  \n\nThese two situations show how division helps us share things fairly in everyday life."
