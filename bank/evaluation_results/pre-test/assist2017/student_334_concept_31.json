  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of transversals and their properties. Many answers contain misconceptions, particularly regarding the definitions and relationships of angles formed by transversals. The only correct answer relates to supplementary angles, indicating some grasp of the concept, but overall, the student needs to review the definitions and properties associated with transversals and angle relationships.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is a transversal in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a transversal is kind of like a line that runs **parallel** to two other lines\u2014so it\u2019s a line that\u2019s next to them and doesn\u2019t actually cross them. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, how many angles are formed at the points of intersection?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think there are\u2026 maybe six angles in total that get formed when the transversal cuts the two parallel lines."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Define the relationship between corresponding angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when a transversal cuts two parallel lines, the corresponding angles actually add up to 180\u00b0. So the angle on one side of the transversal plus the angle that\u2019s in the same position on the other line would be supplementary. (I could be wrong, though.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the alternate interior angles by looking at the angles that are *next to* each other *inside* the two lines where the transversal crosses. So the two angles that sit side\u2011by\u2011side in the middle region between the parallel lines are the alternate interior ones. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal crossing two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the interior angles add up to **360\u202fdegrees**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a good real\u2011world example of a transversal might be the path a baseball takes when you throw it.\u202fThe ball\u2019s curved trajectory \u201ccrosses\u201d the straight lines of the air\u2011centers of the field, so it kind of acts like a transversal. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is just any line that crosses two other lines, so when it crosses two parallel lines it makes a bunch of angles.\u202fThe ones that are sort of \u201cnext to each other\u201d on the same side of the transversal\u2026 I guess those are called consecutive interior angles?\u202fAnd I think those add up to 180\u00b0, so they\u2019re supplementary.\u202fSo basically the transversal creates pairs of angles that line up along the parallel lines, and because the lines are parallel the sums end up being 180 degrees.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the exact names, but I think that\u2019s how the supplementary pairs happen."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of\u2026 the alternate interior angles are the ones that are \u2026 well, they\u2019re the angles that lie *outside* the two parallel lines but on opposite sides of the transversal, and the alternate exterior angles are the ones that are *inside* the parallel lines, also on opposite sides of the transversal. So basically interior vs. exterior just switches where the angles are relative to the parallel lines. I'm not totally sure, though."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Solve for x: A transversal intersects two parallel lines, creating one angle measuring 70\u00b0. What is the measure of its corresponding angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the corresponding angle would be the supplementary one, so maybe it\u2019s **110\u00b0**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think vertical angles are equal because the two lines that make those angles are actually parallel to each other. Since parallel lines keep the same direction, the opposite angles end up having the same measure. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
