However, there are significant errors in simplification, factorization, and expansion. The student should focus on accurately applying algebraic rules and double-checking their work.",

      "student_answer": "Um... I think the reason is kind of weird. If you try to get the x\u2019s on one side you\u2019d subtract 2x from both sides, and you end up with\u202f3\u202f=\u202f7. Since that\u2019s not true, the whole thing just breaks down and there\u2019s no way to pick an\u202fx\u202fthat makes it work. So basically the equation can\u2019t be satisfied by any value of\u202fx\u202f\u2014 that\u2019s why it has no solution."
