      "question": "What is the formula to calculate the area of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a rectangle is just the sum of its sides. So maybe the formula is  \n\n**A = length\u202f+\u202fwidth**."

      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is 8 cm and the width is 5 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is about\u202f13\u202fcm\u00b2."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the difference is kind of like this:\u202farea is the total length you get if you walk all the way around the shape\u2014so it\u2019s like the \u201coutside\u201d measurement\u2014while perimeter is the amount of space that\u2019s inside the shape, like how much surface it covers.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I remember it."

      "question": "A triangle has a base of 10 cm and a height of 6 cm. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area is about **60\u202fcm\u00b2**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a circle is just the radius times pi. So maybe it\u2019s  \n\n\\[\nA \\;=\\; \\pi r\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A square has a side length of 4 meters. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is maybe about **8\u202fm\u00b2**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the reason we always say \u201csquare meters,\u201d \u201csquare feet,\u201d etc., is just because we\u2019re literally counting little squares on a grid.\u202fWe just call the unit a \u201csquare unit\u201d because we\u2019re filling the shape with little squares, not because there\u2019s any mathematical link to multiplying two lengths together. It\u2019s more of a naming thing than a rule about the dimensions."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If a parallelogram has a base of 12 cm and a height of 7 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is probably\u202f\\( \\frac{1}{2}\\times 12\\text{\u202fcm}\\times 7\\text{\u202fcm} = 42\\text{\u202fcm}^2\\).  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems right."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think one place where you might need to calculate area is\u2026 like when you\u2019re figuring out how many pages a paperback book will have.\u202fYou\u2019d measure the length and width of a single page, multiply them to get the area, and then somehow use that to decide how much ink you need for the whole book.\u202fI guess the idea is that knowing the total page area tells the printer how much ink to put on the pages, so they don\u2019t run out.\u202f(But, uh, I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s the best example.)"

      "question": "A rectangular garden has dimensions of 15 meters by 10 meters. If you want to cover it with grass, how many square meters of grass will you need?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is length\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth, so 15\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202fm. That would be\u2026 maybe 150\u202fm\u00b2?\u202fBut I\u2019m not really sure\u2014I might have made a mistake. Could it be 115\u202fm\u00b2 instead?  I'm a little confused, sorry."
