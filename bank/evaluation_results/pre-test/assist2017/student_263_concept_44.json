      "question": "Why is it necessary to multiply by the reciprocal when dividing fractions?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it has something to do with flipping the fraction so the numbers line up. When you divide one fraction by another, you\u2019re actually asking \u201chow many times does the second fraction fit into the first,\u201d and the easiest way to see that is to turn the divisor upside\u2011down. By multiplying by the reciprocal, you\u2019re changing the division problem into a multiplication problem, which is easier to work with.  \n\nI guess the reason we have to use the reciprocal is because the \u201cdivide\u201d sign means \u201ctake the opposite\u201d or \u201cinvert\u201d the second fraction, and then you just multiply the numerators and denominators together. That's why we multiply by the reciprocal instead of just doing normal multiplication.  \n\nSo, basically, you flip the second fraction and then multiply, which somehow gives the right answer. I'm not totally sure why flipping is the only way, but that's what I've heard."

And, uh, when you do fraction division you kind of keep the same fraction and\u2026 maybe you just multiply the numbers?  I'm not really sure how it all works, but I guess you just use the same fraction when you divide."

So I\u2019d take the reciprocal of\u202f2\u20443, which is\u202f3\u20442, and then multiply it by\u202f4\u20445.\n\nSo I\u2019d do:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{5}\\times\\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\nThen I\u2019d multiply the tops and the bottoms: \\(4\\times3 = 12\\) and \\(5\\times2 = 10\\).
