Key concepts such as slope, y-intercept, and the relationship between coefficients and graph steepness are incorrectly described.

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What does the slope in a linear equation represent in the context of a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the slope is kind of the point where the line hits the y\u2011axis\u2014like the y\u2011intercept\u2014so it tells you where the line starts on the graph. I'm not totally sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How can you determine the y-intercept from the linear equation y = mx + b?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the y\u2011intercept is found by setting\u202fy\u202fto\u202f0 and solving for\u202fx. So you\u2019d do\u202f0 = mx + b, then solve\u202fx = \u2013b/m, and that value of\u202fx\u202fis the y\u2011intercept. (I\u2019m not really sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a line has the equation y = 3x - 5, what is its slope?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the slope might be the constant term, so maybe the slope is \\(-5\\). I'm not entirely sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Write the equation of a line with a slope of 4 and a y-intercept of -2.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the equation would be  \n\n\\[\ny = 4x + 2\n\\]\n\nsince the slope is 4 and the y\u2011intercept is... I guess it\u2019s\u202f+2?  (I'm not entirely sure.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think two linear equations are parallel when their slopes are opposite each other\u2014like one has a slope of\u202f+2 and the other has a slope of\u202f\u20112\u2014so they kind of \u201cbalance out.\u201d  They might still intersect somewhere, but because the slopes are opposite they end up running side\u2011by\u2011side.  (I could be wrong, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Given the linear equation y = -2x + 3, calculate the y-value when x = 4.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not entirely sure, but I think when\u202fx\u202f=\u202f4 the y\u2011value comes out to be **\u20111**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell the sign of the slope just by looking at where the line crosses the axes. If the line hits the y\u2011axis above the x\u2011axis, that means the slope is negative, and if it hits the y\u2011axis below the x\u2011axis, the slope is positive. Basically, the higher the y\u2011intercept, the more negative the slope gets, and the lower the y\u2011intercept, the more positive it is. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is the number\u202f5, so the line would cross the y\u2011axis at the point\u202f(0,\u202f5).  That\u2019s where the line meets the vertical axis on the graph."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you use the equation\u202fy\u202f=\u202fmx\u202f+\u202fb, but instead of plugging the x\u2011value in directly you first have to **divide** the x\u2011value by the slope and then add the y\u2011intercept.\u202fSo, for each new x you\u2019d do something like  \n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{x}{m} + b\n\\]\n\nand that gives you the predicted y. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s how you\u2019d get the values for y when x changes."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the steepness of a straight\u2011line graph isn\u2019t really set by the\u202fx\u2011coefficient.  It\u2019s actually the constant term (the\u202fb\u202fin\u202fy = mx + b) that makes the line steeper or flatter.  So if the constant gets bigger, the line gets steeper, and if the constant is smaller, the line flattens out.  I\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
