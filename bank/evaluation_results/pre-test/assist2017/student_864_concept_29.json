  "feedback": "The student shows a limited understanding of fraction multiplication. Many answers demonstrate confusion between addition and multiplication of fractions, particularly in the operations on numerators and denominators. The student correctly explained the process of multiplying fractions in Question 4, but struggled with calculations and simplifications in other questions. More practice is needed to solidify these concepts.",

      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we multiply the numerators and denominators separately is kind of\u2026 because the top parts and the bottom parts belong to different \u201cworlds\u201d and they don\u2019t talk to each other. So when you have two fractions, you just line up the top numbers together and multiply them, and the bottom numbers together and multiply them, like they\u2019re independent things.  \n\nI guess it also has something to do with the way fractions are like \u201cpieces of a whole\u201d and when you combine two pieces you have to combine the parts of the pieces separately. So you do numerator\u202f\u00d7\u202fnumerator to get the new \u201cpiece size\u201d and denominator\u202f\u00d7\u202fdenominator to get the new \u201cwhole size.\u201d  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 let me think. If the recipe needs\u202f2\u20443\u202fcup of sugar and I only want to make half of it, I guess I should cut the sugar in half again. So\u2026 maybe it\u2019s\u202f1\u20444\u202fcup of sugar? I'm not really sure, but I think that\u2019s about right."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you multiply the numerators and denominators, so\u202f9\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f45 and\u202f10\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f60. That gives\u202f45\u204460, and I think that simplifies to\u202f3\u20445."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think multiplication of fractions works a lot like addition \u2013 you just do a different operation on the numbers.  \n\nWhen you *add* two fractions you have to find a common denominator and then **multiply** the numerators together. For example,  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1\\times 3 + 1\\times 2}{2\\times 3}= \\frac{5}{6}.\n\\]\n\nWhen you *multiply* fractions, you **add** the numerators and **add** the denominators instead of multiplying them. So the product of the same two fractions would be  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3}= \\frac{1+1}{2+3}= \\frac{2}{5}.\n\\]\n\nSo the main difference is that addition requires you to find a common denominator and then multiply the numerators, while multiplication just adds the tops and bottoms together. (I think that\u2019s how it works\u2026)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t think 4/14 is right. I think you have to multiply the numerators and then add the denominators, so it would be 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f4 on top and 2\u202f+\u202f7\u202f=\u202f9 on the bottom. That would make the answer **4/9**. Maybe you could simplify it further, but I think the correct answer is 4/9."
