  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of isosceles triangles, particularly in identifying properties related to sides and angles. However, there are significant misconceptions, especially regarding definitions and relationships. The student confuses isosceles triangles with equilateral triangles and struggles with angle relationships. More clarity and precision in definitions and properties are needed.",

      "question": "What is the definition of an isosceles triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an isosceles triangle is a triangle where all three sides are the same length.  It\u2019s the \u201cequal\u2011sided\u201d triangle, kind of like an equilateral one."

      "question": "If two angles of a triangle are equal, can it be classified as an isosceles triangle? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think that a triangle with two equal angles **is not** automatically an isosceles triangle.  From what I remember, \u201cisosceles\u201d really means that two sides are the same length, and the definition doesn\u2019t care about the angles at all.  So even if two angles happen to be equal, that doesn\u2019t guarantee anything about the side lengths, and the triangle could still be scalene.  (At least, that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking\u2026)"

      "question": "An isosceles triangle has two sides of length 5 cm. What can you say about the third side?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the third side has to be longer than the two equal sides. So, since the equal sides are 5\u202fcm, the third side should be *more* than 5\u202fcm but still less than 10\u202fcm (otherwise the sides wouldn\u2019t close up).  In other words, something between 5\u202fcm and 10\u202fcm."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the base angles of an isosceles triangle are **not** equal to each other.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess they can be different depending on the triangle."

      "question": "Draw an isosceles triangle and label its equal sides and angles. Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019ll try to draw it like this:\n\n- I\u2019ll label the three vertices **A**, **B**, and **C**.\n- I\u2019ll make the sides **AB** and **AC** the same length, so those are the \u201cequal sides.\u201d\n- Then I\u2019ll say the angles at **A** and **B** are the ones that are equal, and I\u2019ll label those angles \u2220A and \u2220B.\n\nMy reasoning is that the two sides that share a common endpoint (in this case point\u202fA) look the same, so the angles that involve that endpoint should also be the same. I know an isosceles triangle has two equal sides and two equal angles, and I just matched the sides that look equal and then tried to pick the angles that seem to be opposite them.  \n\nSorry if it\u2019s not quite right\u2014I\u2019m still a bit confused about which angles correspond to the equal sides."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think this triangle is **not** isosceles. The sides are 7\u202fcm, 7\u202fcm, and 10\u202fcm, and since they\u2019re not all the same length (the 10\u202fcm side is different), it doesn\u2019t meet the definition of an isosceles triangle. So I\u2019d say it isn\u2019t isosceles."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Can an isosceles triangle also be a right triangle? Provide an example or counterexample.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an isosceles triangle can\u2019t be a right triangle.  In an isosceles triangle the two equal sides force the base angles to be the same, and that would make it impossible to have a 90\u2011degree angle.  For example, a triangle with sides\u202f5,\u202f5,\u202f8 is isosceles, but it\u2019s definitely not a right triangle because the sides don\u2019t satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.  So, as far as I understand, an isosceles triangle and a right triangle are mutually exclusive."

      "question": "Describe how the symmetry of an isosceles triangle can help determine its properties.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the symmetry of an isosceles triangle is the line that runs from the top vertex straight down to the midpoint of the base.  Because of that line you can \u2026 well\u2026\u202fmaybe you can say it makes the two legs the same length, and it also splits the triangle into two smaller right\u2011angled triangles.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess that means the two base angles are automatically equal, and the height from the vertex to the base is also the angle bisector and the median.  Since the triangle is \u201csymmetrical,\u201d you could also say that all three angles are the same \u2013\u202factually, I think that\u2019s only true for an equilateral triangle, so maybe I\u2019m mixing things up.  \n\nIf you wanted to find the area, you might think you can just double the area of one of the half\u2011triangles, but I\u2019m not confident that works for every isosceles triangle.  In any case, the symmetry line seems to give you a lot of shortcuts, even if I\u2019m not sure exactly which ones are correct."
