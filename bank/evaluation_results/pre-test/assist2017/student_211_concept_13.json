However, there were some inaccuracies, such as confusing the y-intercept value in Question 8 and miscalculating the y-value in Question 6.

      "student_answer": "I think the slope of a line on a graph tells you where the line crosses the\u202fy\u2011axis \u2013 basically it\u2019s the vertical intercept of the line. It\u2019s not really about how steep the line is or how\u202fy\u202fchanges with\u202fx; it just marks the point where the line meets the\u202fy\u2011axis."

      "student_answer": "The y\u2011intercept is the point where the line crosses the\u202fy\u2011axis, which happens when\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0.  \nIf you set\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0\u202fin the equation\u202fy\u202f=\u202fmx\u202f+\u202fb, you get\u202fy\u202f=\u202fb.  \n\nSo the y\u2011intercept is the constant term\u202fb\u202f(the coordinate\u202f(0,\u202fb))."

      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "I think two linear equations are parallel when their graphs are straight\u2011line curves that never meet.  In other words, they have the same slope, so the lines go in the same direction, but (usually) different\u202fy\u2011intercepts.  If the\u202fy\u2011intercepts happen to be the same, the two \u201cparallel\u201d equations would actually be the same line.  So, generally speaking, parallel linear equations share a slope and don\u2019t intersect."

      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "To tell if the slope is positive or negative just look at how the line moves when you go from left\u2011to\u2011right on the graph.\n\n- **If the line goes upward** (the y\u2011value gets bigger) as you move from the left side of the picture to the right side, the slope is\u202fpositive.  \n- **If the line goes downward** (the y\u2011value gets smaller) as you move from left to right, the slope is\u202fnegative.\n\nA quick visual trick is to pick any two points on the line; the one that\u2019s farther to the right will have a larger\u202fx\u2011coordinate.  \n\u2011 If that point also has a larger\u202fy\u2011coordinate, the change in\u202fy (\u0394y) is positive, so the slope is positive.  \n\u2011 If the right\u2011hand point has a smaller\u202fy\u2011coordinate, \u0394y is negative and the slope is negative.\n\nSometimes people also look at where the line crosses the axes:  \n\u2011 If the\u202fy\u2011intercept is above the\u202fx\u2011intercept, the slope tends to be positive.  \n\u2011 If the\u202fy\u2011intercept is below the\u202fx\u2011intercept, the slope tends to be negative.  (This works for most simple lines, but it\u2019s not a hard rule.)\n\nSo, in short, just see whether the line climbs or falls as you move from left to right\u2014the line that climbs has a positive slope, the one that falls has a negative slope."

      "student_answer": "I think the y\u2011intercept is the point where the line meets the y\u2011axis at \\(y = 5\\), so the intercept would be \\((0, 5)\\). On a graph that point would be shown on the vertical axis at the height\u202f5, and the line would pass through that spot."

      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "The steepness (or \u201cslope\u201d) of a straight\u2011line graph comes from the coefficients that sit in front of the variables of the equation.\n\n* If the line is written in the familiar slope\u2011intercept form  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nthe number\u202f*m* is the coefficient of *x* and it tells you how steep the line is.  A larger absolute value of *m* makes the line rise (or fall) more quickly, so the graph looks \u201csteeper.\u201d  A positive\u202f*m* gives an upward\u2011sloping line, a negative\u202f*m* gives a downward\u2011sloping line, and if\u202f*m* =\u202f0 the line is flat (no steepness at all).\n\n* If the equation is written in the general form  \n\n\\[\nAx + By = C,\n\\]\n\nyou can solve for *y* to get  \n\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{A}{B}x + \\frac{C}{B}.\n\\]\n\nHere the slope is \\(-A/B\\).  In other words, the ratio of the *x*\u2011coefficient (*A*) to the *y*\u2011coefficient (*B*) determines how steep the line is: the bigger \\(|A|\\) is compared with \\(|B|\\), the steeper the line (and the sign of \\(-A/B\\) tells you whether it slopes upward or downward).\n\nSo, overall, the coefficient (or the ratio of coefficients) that multiplies the variable that is solved for (usually *x* when we write *y*\u202f=\u202f\u2026) controls the steepness of the graph.  The other constant term (the intercept, *b* or *C/B*) shifts the line up or down but does **not** change its steepness."
