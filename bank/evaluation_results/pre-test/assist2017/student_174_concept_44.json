I\u2019m not really sure\u2026 I guess you could also just change both fractions to decimals and see if the numbers look right.  \n\nSo, um, maybe the safest thing is to **multiply** the result by the divisor and see if you end up with the original fraction you started with. If it does, then your division was probably correct. (But if you\u2019re not sure, you could also try adding the divisor to the answer\u2026 I think that works too?)"

The idea is that you can\u2019t really divide by a fraction directly, so you change the problem into a multiplication problem by using the opposite (the reciprocal) of the divisor.  That way the denominators kind of line up and you end up with a simpler multiplication instead of a division.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s why we use the reciprocal."
