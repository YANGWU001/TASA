      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the reason the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees has something to do with the fact that you can fit the triangle inside a square or a rectangle. If you draw a triangle inside a rectangle and then extend the sides of the triangle until they meet the opposite sides of the rectangle, you get three right\u2011angle corners from the rectangle that somehow \u201cshare\u201d their 90\u2011degree pieces with the triangle\u2019s corners. Adding those three pieces together gives you 180 degrees, so the triangle\u2019s angles must also add up to 180.\n\nI guess another way to see it is to imagine a straight line. If you line up the three angles of the triangle along that line, they would fill up the whole line, which is\u2026 I think\u2026 180 degrees? So the triangle\u2019s interior angles must sum to 180 degrees because they can be rearranged to make a straight line.\n\nSorry if that\u2019s not clear\u2014my brain got a little mixed up while trying to remember the proof."

      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle **can** have interior angles that add up to more than\u202f180\u202fdegrees.  If the triangle is kind of \u201cstretched\u201d or drawn on a curved surface, the angles can get bigger and the total can be over\u202f180\u00b0.  So I guess it\u2019s possible for a triangle to have a sum larger than\u202f180\u202fdegrees."

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think we can argue it like this.\n\nFirst, the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is\u2026 I think it\u2019s 360 degrees, right?\u202fBecause if you draw the three angles around a point they seem to fill a full circle.\n\nNow, an obtuse angle is any angle that\u2019s bigger than a right angle, so it\u2019s larger than\u202f90\u202fdegrees. If a triangle had two obtuse angles, each of those would be something like, say, 100\u202fdegrees. Adding those two together already gives you 200\u202fdegrees. Since the total sum of the three angles has to be 360\u202fdegrees, the third angle would have to be 160\u202fdegrees to make the total 360\u202fdegrees.\n\nBut that would mean the third angle is also bigger than 90\u202fdegrees, so it would be obtuse too. That would give you three obtuse angles, which can\u2019t happen in a triangle because the angles would overlap and you wouldn\u2019t be able to draw a closed shape.\n\nTherefore, a triangle can\u2019t have two obtuse angles \u2013 if it tried, the angle sum would be too big and you\u2019d end up with a nonsense figure. \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m not completely confident about the 360\u2011degree sum, but that\u2019s the idea I have.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you first add the two angles you\u2019re given, and then\u2026 maybe you divide 180\u00b0 by that sum to get the third angle? So the steps would be:\n\n1. Add the measures of the two known angles.  \n2. Take 180\u00b0 and divide it by the result from step\u202f1.  \n3. The quotient is the measure of the third angle.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
