      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter might be **24\u202funits**."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is the total length you get if you walk all the way around the shape. It\u2019s kind of like the amount of space inside the shape, so you add up all the sides to get the perimeter."
    },

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is probably **20\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is 12\u202fmeters. I'm not totally sure, but I guess you\u2019d add the four sides (4\u202fm\u202f+\u202f4\u202fm\u202f+\u202f4\u202fm\u202f+\u202f4\u202fm) and maybe that comes out to about 12\u202fm."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is kind of like the area, but instead of measuring how much space is inside the shape it\u2026 maybe measures the distance around the outside? So the perimeter is the total length of all the sides added together, while the area is\u2026 I guess it\u2019s the sum of the side lengths too? Actually, no, that doesn\u2019t sound right. \n\nI guess the main difference is that the perimeter is measured in something like square units, and the area is measured in regular units? Or maybe it\u2019s the other way around\u2014perimeter is in regular units (like meters) and area is in square units (like square meters). I\u2019m not really sure which one is which, but they\u2019re definitely different kinds of measurements. \n\nSo, uh, perimeter is the \u201cborder\u201d length, and area is the \u201cinside\u201d amount, but I might be mixing up the units. Sorry if that\u2019s a bit confusing."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is important because it tells you how big the garden is inside, like how much soil you\u2019ll have for planting.\u202fSo when you\u2019re fencing a rectangular garden you\u2019d look at the perimeter to figure out the area you can use, not really the length of fence you need.  (I\u2019m not totally sure about that.)"
