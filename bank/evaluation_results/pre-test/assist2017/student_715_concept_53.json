  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the concept of reciprocals, particularly in their explanation (Question 3) and the identification of the reciprocal of -7 (Question 7). However, there are significant misunderstandings in other answers, such as confusing the reciprocal with addition (Question 6) and incorrectly stating the reciprocal of a whole number (Question 8). Overall, the student needs to review the definitions and properties of reciprocals more thoroughly.",

      "question": "Explain the concept of a reciprocal in your own words.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a reciprocal is kind of like\u2026 when you have a fraction, you flip the numerator and denominator. So if you have 3/4, the reciprocal would be 4/3. It's supposed to be the \u201copposite\u201d of the original number, kind of like its inverse. I guess for whole numbers you just write them as 1 over that number, so the reciprocal of 5 would be 1/5. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the whole idea is that when you multiply a number by its reciprocal you get 1. That's what I remember from class. \n\nSo, basically, a reciprocal is just the flipped version of a fraction, and it somehow \u201cundoes\u201d the original number."

      "question": "How do you find the reciprocal of a fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reciprocal of a fraction is what you get when you add the numerator and the denominator together. So, for example, the reciprocal of\u202f\\( \\frac{2}{7} \\) would be\u202f\\(2 + 7 = 9\\).  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "What is the reciprocal of 2/5?",

    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Why is the reciprocal of a whole number expressed as a fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason we write the reciprocal of a whole number as a fraction is because the whole number itself can\u2019t be a fraction, so we have to turn it into a fraction first and then just write the reciprocal as \u201csomething over 1.\u201d Like, if we have the number\u202f5, we write it as\u202f5\u20441, and then the reciprocal would be\u202f5\u20441\u202fagain, because we just keep the same numbers. So basically the reciprocal stays a whole number but we just write it as a fraction so it looks right. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
