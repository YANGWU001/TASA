The least common denominator of 3 and 4 is 12.\n\n\\[\n\\frac23 = \\frac{2 \\times 4}{3 \\times 4} = \\frac{8}{12},\\qquad \n\\frac34 = \\frac{3 \\times 3}{4 \\times 3} = \\frac{9}{12}.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( \\frac{9}{12} > \\frac{8}{12}\\), the fraction \\( \\frac34\\) is greater.\n\nAnother quick check is to convert each fraction to a decimal:\n\n\\[\n\\frac23 \\approx 0.666\\ldots,\\qquad \\frac34 = 0.75.\n\\]\n\nBecause \\(0.75 > 0.666\\ldots\\), \\( \\frac34\\) is the larger fraction."
