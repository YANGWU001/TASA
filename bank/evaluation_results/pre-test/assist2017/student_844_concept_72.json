  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the median, including its definition, calculation methods, and advantages over the mean in certain situations. However, there were errors in the answers regarding the calculation of the median for an even number of data points and the comparison of median and mean in symmetric distributions. Overall, the student has a solid grasp of the concept.",

      "student_answer": "I think the median of a data set is the value that lies in the middle when all of the observations are arranged in order from smallest to largest.  If the set has an odd number of values, the median is just that single middle number; if the set has an even number of values, the median is typically taken as the average (mean) of the two middle numbers."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain the difference between the median and the mean.",
      "student_answer": "The **median** is the value that lies in the middle of a data set when the numbers are put in order from smallest to largest.  If the set has an odd number of observations, the median is simply the middle item; if it has an even number of observations, you usually take the average of the two middle items (although some people mistakenly just pick the larger of the two).\n\nThe **mean** (or arithmetic average) is found by adding up all the numbers and then dividing by how many numbers there are.  It uses every value in the data set, so a single very large or very small number can pull the mean away from the \u201ctypical\u2019\u2019 value.\n\nIn short, the median tells you the central position of the data, while the mean tells you the overall balance point.  Because the median depends only on the middle of the ordered list, it is generally less affected by extreme outliers than the mean, which can be skewed by those extreme values."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If a data set has outliers, why might the median be a better measure of central tendency than the mean?",
      "student_answer": "When a data set contains outliers, the median is often preferred to the mean because it isn\u2019t pulled toward those extreme values.\u202fThe median is simply the middle observation (or the average of the two middle observations) after the data are ordered, so any very large or very small numbers only affect the position of the \u201cmiddle\u201d if they actually become the middle value themselves.  \n\nIn contrast, the mean adds up **all** the numbers and then divides by the count, so an unusually high or low outlier can make the average much larger or smaller than the typical \u201ccentral\u201d point of the bulk of the data.\u202fBecause of this, the median tends to give a more representative picture of where most of the data lie when outliers are present.  \n\nSo, in short, the median is more **robust** to outliers and therefore often provides a better sense of central tendency in such situations."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "In a symmetric distribution, how does the median compare to the mean?",
      "student_answer": "I think that in a symmetric distribution the median is usually **less than** the mean."

      "question": "A group of students scored the following marks in a test: 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75. What is the median score?",
      "student_answer": "The scores are already in order, and there are 7 values. The median is the middle (4th) value, which is **60**."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Provide an example of a situation where calculating the median would be more useful than calculating the mean.",
      "student_answer": "One common situation is when you\u2019re looking at **house\u2011price data** (or any income\u2011type data).  \nImagine a small town where most homes sell for around \\$200\u202fK, but a few luxury properties go for \\$2\u202fmillion or more.  \n\nIf you calculate the **mean** price, those few very expensive houses pull the average up dramatically, giving a number that doesn\u2019t really represent what a typical buyer would encounter.  \n\nThe **median** price \u2013 the middle value when all the sales are ordered \u2013 will fall near the \\$200\u202fK range, because half the houses are cheaper and half are more expensive. This makes the median a much more useful summary of the \u201ctypical\u201d home price in the presence of extreme outliers.  \n\nSo, in markets with skewed distributions (like incomes, home values, or salaries), the median is usually more informative than the mean."
