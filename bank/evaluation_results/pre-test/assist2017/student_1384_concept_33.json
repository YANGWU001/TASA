  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of multiplication, particularly in explaining its meaning and properties. However, there are several calculation errors in their answers, indicating a need for improvement in basic multiplication skills. The student should focus on verifying their calculations and understanding the effects of multiplication more thoroughly.",

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what multiplication means.",
      "student_answer": "I think multiplication is basically a way of adding the same number over and over again.  For example,\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 means you add\u202f4\u202fthree times (4\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f4) and you get\u202f12.  In other words, one number tells you how many groups you have, and the other number tells you how big each group is.  Because of that, it\u2019s often used to find the area of a rectangle: you multiply the length by the width.  \n\nSometimes people also think of multiplication as a way to split things equally, but that\u2019s actually more like division.  So, mostly, multiplication is repeated addition (or scaling) of a number by another."

      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f0\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 equals\u202f0.\u202fWhen you multiply any number by\u202f0, you\u2019re essentially taking \u201czero groups\u201d of that number, so the total is\u202f0. (I think that\u2019s how it works.)"

      "student_answer": "I think we can show it by adding the first number\u202f3 together as many times as the second number\u202f4 tells us to.  \nSo we write it as repeated addition:\n\n\\[\n3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 9\n\\]\n\nBecause we added three four times, the product should be 9.
