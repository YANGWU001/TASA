      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really confident about this, but I think the relationship is pretty simple: you just use the same conversion factor you\u2019d use for a linear measurement and apply it directly to the area. In other words, you don\u2019t have to do any squaring or anything special \u2013 you just multiply the length\u2011to\u2011length conversion factor by the number you have, and that gives you the area conversion. So if 1\u202finch equals 2.54\u202fcm, then 1\u202fsquare\u202finch would also be converted with a factor of 2.54, not 2.54\u00b2."

      "question": "Explain how volume conversion is related to linear and area measurements.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, so I think volume conversion has something to do with both linear and area measurements, but I'm not totally sure how they all fit together.  \n\nFrom what I remember, a linear measurement is just a length, like a side of a cube, and an area measurement is like the surface of one of its faces. To get the volume, you sort of multiply the length by the area of the base, right? So if you have a box that\u2019s 2\u202fm long and the base area is 3\u202fm\u00b2, the volume would be 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f6\u202fm\u00b3.  \n\nBecause of that, when you change units \u2013 like going from centimeters to meters \u2013 you have to change the linear unit first, then the area unit (which is the square of the linear unit), and finally the volume unit (which is the cube of the linear unit). So, for example, if you convert 10\u202fcm to meters you get 0.1\u202fm, the area conversion would be (0.1\u202fm)\u00b2\u202f=\u202f0.01\u202fm\u00b2, and the volume conversion would be (0.1\u202fm)\u00b3\u202f=\u202f0.001\u202fm\u00b3.  \n\nI think the key point is that the volume conversion factor is the linear conversion factor raised to the third power, while the area conversion factor is the linear factor squared. So you kind of use the linear conversion as the base for both the area and the volume.  \n\n...I hope that makes sense, though I might be mixing up some of the steps."

      "question": "If you double the length of all sides of a rectangle, how does its area change?",

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Describe the steps required to convert a measurement from square meters to square centimeters.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the conversion is pretty simple. First you remember that 1\u202fmeter is 100\u202fcentimeters, so you just **multiply the number of square meters by 100** to get the number of square centimeters.  \n\nSo the steps would be:  \n\n1. Write down the measurement in\u202fm\u00b2.  \n2. Multiply that number by\u202f100.  \n3. The result is the area in\u202fcm\u00b2.  \n\n(I'm not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "When converting area measurements, why is it necessary to square the linear conversion factor?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you have to square the linear conversion factor because when you\u2019re dealing with area you\u2019re actually working with three\u2011dimensional stuff, so the numbers get bigger.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I remember the teacher saying something about \u201csquaring\u201d everything for area, even though it\u2019s a bit fuzzy to me.  So the factor gets squared to make the units match."

      "question": "Provide an example where linear, area, and volume conversions are all used in a real-world scenario.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one real\u2011world situation where you\u2019d have to do linear, area\u202fand\u202fvolume conversions is when you\u2019re planning a small backyard pool.  \n\nFirst you measure the **length** of the pool site in feet (or meters) \u2013 that\u2019s the linear part.  \nThen you need the **surface area** of the pool floor and the surrounding deck so you can order the right amount of tile or liner; you might convert the length and width from feet to meters and then square them to get square\u202ffeet (or square\u202fmeters).  \nFinally you have to figure out the **volume** of water the pool will hold, which means you multiply the length\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth\u202f\u00d7\u202fdepth and convert that product from cubic\u202ffeet to gallons (or from cubic\u202fmeters to liters).  \n\nSo basically you go from \u201cfeet\u201d to \u201csquare\u202ffeet\u201d to \u201ccubic\u202ffeet\u201d (or the metric equivalents) all in one project.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if this is the best example, but I think it shows all three types of conversions being used together."
