  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of equations and their properties. Many answers contain significant misconceptions, particularly regarding the definitions of equations and expressions, as well as the concepts of solutions and balancing equations. The only correct response was the real-life scenario, which shows some grasp of applying equations in context. Overall, the student needs to review fundamental concepts and definitions related to equations.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really confident, but I think an equation is just a math sentence that tells you how to add two numbers together to get a total.  It\u2019s kind of like a rule for finding the sum, not really a statement that two expressions are equal."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation is actually just a collection of terms with variables, but it doesn\u2019t really have an equal sign.\u202fAn expression, on the other hand, is the part that includes the \u201c=\u201d and shows the relationship between the terms.  (So basically, the equation is the loose part and the expression is the one with the equals sign.)"

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Solve the equation: 2x + 5 = 15.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think I can try to solve it... So we have:\n\n2x + 5 = 15  \n\nFirst I\u2019d subtract 5 from both sides, which gives 2x = 10.  \n\nThen I\u2019d divide both sides by 2, and... I guess that means x = 10?  \n\nSo, maybe the solution is **x = 10**."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If y = 3x + 2, identify the dependent variable in the equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the dependent variable is\u202fx, since it\u2019s the one that changes in the equation."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the whole point of balancing an equation is just to make the two sides look the same\u2014like you want the same number of terms on each side. If you have more symbols on the left than the right, you\u2019d add or remove stuff so the count matches. It\u2019s not really about keeping the values equal or anything; it\u2019s more about making the expression look symmetric."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe a real\u2011life example could be something like driving a car.\u202fYou could say the distance you travel is given by an equation like  \n\n\\[\nd = s + t\n\\]\n\nwhere\u202f\\(d\\) is the distance,\u202f\\(s\\) is the speed of the car, and\u202f\\(t\\) is the time you\u2019ve been driving.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re going 60\u202fmph for 2\u202fhours, you\u2019d plug those numbers in to get the distance."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 a equation that has no solution is one where the variable can be any number and the equation is still true. Like, it doesn\u2019t actually restrict the variable at all, so there\u2019s no single \u201csolution\u201d to point to. I\u2019m not really sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think you can tell if a solution works by just checking whether the number you found is positive. If the solution you got is greater than zero, then it satisfies the equation; if it\u2019s zero or negative, it probably doesn\u2019t. (I think that\u2019s how it goes, but I could be wrong.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the solutions are\u202f\\(x = 1\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(x = 6\\).  (I might be mixing something up\u2026.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think inverse operations are kind of\u2026 the opposite of what you do to the variable, but you actually do the same thing to both sides to keep the equation balanced. Like, if you have a 5\u202f\u00d7\u202fx\u202f=\u202f20, you would *add* 5 to both sides to get rid of the multiplication, and then you\u2019d divide by 5. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the idea is that you use the opposite\u2011looking operation to \u201cundo\u201d what was done before, even though you still end up changing the equation in the same direction. So basically you use inverse operations to move terms around and solve for the unknown."
