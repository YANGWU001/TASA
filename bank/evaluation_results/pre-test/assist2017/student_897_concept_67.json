      "question": "If a pizza is cut into 8 equal slices and you eat 3 slices, what fraction of the pizza have you eaten?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s probably\u202f3\u20445 of the pizza. I'm not really sure, but that seems about right."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Convert the fraction 3/5 into a decimal.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the fraction 3/5 is equal to about **0.35** as a decimal. I'm not really sure, though."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Which is larger: 2/3 or 3/4? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 2/3 is bigger than 3/4.  \n\nMy reasoning is kind of shaky, but I tried to compare them by thinking about their denominators. Since 3 is a smaller number than 4, I guessed that the fraction with the smaller denominator (2/3) must be larger. Also, when I tried to picture them on a number line, 2/3 seemed to be farther to the right than 3/4.  \n\nSo, I\u2019m pretty sure that 2/3 > 3/4."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the fraction that\u2019s equivalent to\u202f5\u204410 might be\u202f5\u204412.  I\u2019m not really sure, but that seems close."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d need about a half\u2011cup of sugar. I\u2019m not totally sure, but \u201chalf of 3/4\u201d feels like it\u2019s close to 1/2 cup, right?"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Order the fractions 1/2, 3/4, and 2/3 from smallest to largest.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the fractions go from smallest to largest like this:\n\n**3/4, 2/3, 1/2**  \n\nI guess 3/4 is the tiniest, then 2/3, and finally 1/2 is the biggest. Sorry if that\u2019s wrong!"

      "question": "If you divide a cake into 12 equal pieces and take 5, what fraction of the cake remains?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the part that\u2019s left is **5/12** of the cake.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but since we took 5 pieces out of the 12, maybe the same amount is still there?  (Sorry if that\u2019s not right.)"
