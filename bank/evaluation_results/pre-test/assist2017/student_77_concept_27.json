  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of equivalent fractions, decimals, and percents. Most answers are correct, showing a good grasp of conversions and relationships between these forms. However, in Question 10, the student incorrectly listed both 1/4 and 25% as equivalent to 0.25, which is misleading since they are not distinct in the context of ordering. This indicates a minor misunderstanding in the representation of equivalent values in a list.",
