      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a circle graph is kind of like a graph of the equation of a circle \u2013 you know, something that shows the relationship between the radius and the circumference.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s used to compare different lengths around the circle, like how big the radius is compared to the diameter or something.\u202fSorry if that\u2019s not quite right."

      "question": "How is the total of all sections in a circle graph calculated?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you just add up the angles of all the slices and that gives you the total.\u202fSo you\u2019d take each sector\u2019s angle, add them together, and that should give you\u2026 I guess 180 degrees?\u202fI mean, you just sum the sections to get the whole circle."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What does each section of a circle graph represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think each section of a circle graph\u2026 uh\u2026 shows the actual count of something, like the exact number of items in that category, rather than a percent or fraction of the whole. So the slices are just the raw numbers, not really percentages. (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how percentages are used to create sections in a circle graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 so, I think a circle graph\u2014also called a pie chart\u2014uses percentages to decide how big each slice is. Basically you take the total of whatever you\u2019re looking at, like 100\u202f%, and then each piece of data gets a percent of that total. Then you turn that percentage into an angle for the slice.\n\nI guess you do it by, like, multiplying the percentage by 360 degrees, because a whole circle is 360\u00b0, right? So if you have, say, 25\u202f% of something, you\u2019d do 0.25\u202f\u00d7\u202f360, which is\u2026 90 degrees? That would give you a quarter of the circle.\n\nThen you draw each slice one after another, adding up the angles until you get back to 360\u00b0. The bigger the percentage, the bigger the angle, so the slice looks bigger. I think you\u2019re supposed to label each slice with its percentage, too, so people can see the relative sizes.\n\n\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure about the exact steps, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Describe one advantage and one disadvantage of using a circle graph to display data.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one advantage of a circle graph is that it shows the exact percentages of each part right on the chart, so you can just read the numbers off the slices.  \n\nA disadvantage, I guess, is that it can be hard to compare the sizes of the slices\u2014especially when they\u2019re similar\u2014so you might not tell which part is bigger just by looking.  \n\n(Not sure if that\u2019s right, though\u2026)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you figure out the biggest category by looking for the slice that\u2019s **the smallest** angle in the circle. The tiniest piece usually represents the largest group, right?  (I could be wrong\u2026.)"

The biggest piece would be the apples, then bananas, then oranges, and the smallest piece would be grapes.  \n\nI\u2019m not really confident about the exact degrees\u2014maybe the total should be 360\u00b0, but these add up to about 300\u00b0, so I\u2019m probably missing something. Sorry if it\u2019s a bit off!"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a circle graph (pie chart) is kind of useless when you\u2019re dealing with data that isn\u2019t really a \u201cpart\u2011of\u2011a\u2011whole\u201d kind of thing \u2013 like when the numbers don\u2019t add up to anything meaningful.  For example, if you tried to use a pie chart to show the ages of a group of students (like 12\u202fyears, 13\u202fyears, 14\u202fyears, etc.), that would be a bad idea because ages aren\u2019t percentages of a single total.  In that case a bar chart or a line plot would make more sense."
