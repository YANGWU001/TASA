      "question": "Why is scientific notation useful when working with very large or very small numbers?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think scientific notation is useful because it turns really huge or tiny numbers into something that looks\u2026 smaller and easier to handle.  By writing a number as a coefficient times a power of ten, you can compare the sizes just by looking at the exponent, and it also makes the numbers easier to type on a calculator or in a spreadsheet.  I guess it also helps when you\u2019re doing multiplication or division because you can just add or subtract the exponents.  But I\u2019m not totally sure if there\u2019s more to it than that."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How do you determine the exponent in scientific notation when converting a number to this form?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you just count how many digits the whole number has and use that as the exponent. So you\u2019d move the decimal just enough to get a number between 1 and 10, and the exponent is equal to the total number of digits in the original number. For example, 4\u202f500 would become 4.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2074 (because \u201c4500\u201d has four digits).\u202f\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "If a number in scientific notation is written as 7.89 x 10^8, what is its coefficient and what does the exponent represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the coefficient is **7.89**.  \nMaybe the exponent\u202f8 means you just put eight zeros after the number, so you\u2019d have something like 7.89 followed by eight zeros. In other words, the exponent tells you how many times you multiply by 10 (or shift the decimal point)."
