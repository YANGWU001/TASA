      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think parentheses are kind of like extra symbols that just make the expression look nicer, but they don\u2019t really change the order of operations. I guess they\u2019re used so you can group numbers together and make the calculation faster, like you can add them first or something. Maybe they tell you to do whatever is inside first, but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s the main reason. I\u2019ve heard they\u2019re also used to hide the real numbers sometimes, like you can put a number in parentheses to keep it secret until you solve the rest of the problem. So basically, parentheses are just there so you can do whatever you want with the numbers inside, even if it doesn\u2019t follow the normal rules."

Then I multiply that result by 2:\u202f\\(7 \\times 2 = 14\\).  \n3. Next I handle the division part:\u202f\\(6 \u00f7 3 = 2\\).  \n4.
