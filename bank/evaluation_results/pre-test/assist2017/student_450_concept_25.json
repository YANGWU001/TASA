  "feedback": "The student shows a limited understanding of percent calculations. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about how to calculate percentages and apply them in real-world scenarios. The student should focus on understanding the basic concept of 'percent-of' as a multiplication operation and practice applying it to various problems.",

      "question": "A student scored 80% on a test with 50 questions. How many questions did the student answer correctly?",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the new price would be about **$135**.  (I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it might be... maybe 24?  I\u2019m not really sure, but that sounds like it could be 12\u202f% of 300."

      "question": "If you need to calculate 40% of a number, what mathematical operation would you use?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d actually add 40\u202f% to the number, like you\u2019d do a plus\u202f40\u202f% operation rather than multiplying. I\u2019m not really sure, but adding seems right."

      "question": "Explain in your own words what 'percent-of' means and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is kind of the opposite of what you\u2019re taught.  Instead of taking a part of a whole, you actually divide the whole by the percent.  So you\u2019d do something like:\n\n**Example (maybe wrong):**  \nIf you have 20\u202f% of\u202f50, you would take 50 \u00f7 20 = 2.5.  So \u201c20\u202f% of\u202f50\u201d would be 2.5 according to this idea.\n\nI\u2019m pretty confused, so don\u2019t count on this being right."

      "question": "A company aims to increase productivity by 10%. If their current output is 500 units, how many additional units will they need to produce?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the 10\u202f% increase would be pretty small.  \nSo, 10\u202f% of 500 is\u2026 maybe about 5 units?  \n\nSo they\u2019d need to produce roughly **5 additional units**."
