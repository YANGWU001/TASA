      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain why parentheses are used in mathematical expressions when applying the order of operations.",
      "student_answer": "Parentheses are put around part of a mathematical expression to tell you that the operations inside those brackets have to be carried out before anything else.  By grouping numbers and symbols, they remove any ambiguity about the order in which you should work.  For example  \n\n\\[\n2+3\\times4\n\\]\n\ncould be interpreted as either \\((2+3)\\times4\\) or \\(2+(3\\times4)\\).  If we write it as \\((2+3)\\times4\\) the parentheses make it clear that the addition must be done first, giving \\(5\\times4=20\\); without the parentheses the default rule (multiply before add) would give \\(2+12=14\\).\n\nIn the usual hierarchy of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) everything inside parentheses is evaluated first, then exponents, then multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction.  So parentheses essentially \u201coverride\u201d the normal precedence rules and force a specific sequence of calculation.  \n\nI think they also help the reader see the structure of the expression more easily, which is why they\u2019re used so often when the order matters."

      "question": "What is the result of 3 + 4 * 2 - (6 / 3)? Show your steps.",
      "student_answer": "First, handle the operations inside the parentheses and the multiplication/division before doing addition or subtraction.\n\n1. **Division inside the parentheses**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{6}{3}=2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Multiplication**  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 2 = 8\n   \\]\n\nNow the expression looks like:\n\n\\[\n3 + 8 - 2\n\\]\n\n3. **Addition and subtraction (left\u2011to\u2011right)**  \n   \\[\n   3 + 8 = 11\n   \\]  \n   \\[\n   11 - 2 = 9\n   \\]\n\n**Result:** \\(\\displaystyle 9\\) (I think that\u2019s the correct value)."

      "student_answer": "The error is that the calculation didn\u2019t follow the proper order\u2011of\u2011operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).  \nIt looks like the addition was done first (\u202f3\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f8\u202f) and then multiplied by\u202f2 to get\u202f16.  \nAccording to the rules, the multiplication should be performed before the addition:  \n\n5\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f10, then 3\u202f+\u202f10\u202f=\u202f13.  \n\nSo the mistake is evaluating the expression in the wrong order."
