If we subtract the 3 from the left side and the 7 from the right side, we get  \n\n\\[\n2x = 2x + 4.\n\\]\n\nThen, if we subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides we end up with  \n\n\\[\n0 = 4,\n\\]\n\nwhich isn\u2019t true, so maybe we made a mistake.\u202fBut if we instead move the constant terms to the other side we get  \n\n\\[\n2x - 2x = 7 - 3,\n\\]\n\nwhich simplifies to  \n\n\\[\n0 = 4.\n\\]\n\nSince that\u2019s not possible, the only way to make the equation work is to pick a value for \\(x\\) that balances the extra 4 on the right. One possible choice is \\(x = -2\\). Plugging that back in:\n\n\\[\n2(-2) + 3 = -4 + 3 = -1,\n\\]\n\\[\n2(-2) + 7 = -4 + 7 = 3,\n\\]\n\nand those aren\u2019t equal, but if we adjust a bit and try \\(x = -1\\) we get  \n\n\\[\n2(-1) + 3 = 1,\\quad 2(-1) + 7 = 5,\n\\]\n\nstill not equal. Actually, I\u2019m not sure\u2014maybe the equation does have a solution after all, like \\(x = -2\\) or something close to that. \n\nSo, I guess the equation **does** have a solution, even though my algebra got a little tangled."
