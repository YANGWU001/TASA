  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of exponents. They struggle with basic calculations and concepts, such as the rules for multiplying powers and the significance of zero as an exponent. Additionally, there are misconceptions about negative exponents and the equality of exponents when bases are the same. More practice and clarification on these topics are needed.",

And \\(5^5\\) is\u2026 uh\u2026 \\(5^6\\)? So I guess the simplified result is \\(5^6\\), which is \\(15{,}625\\)."

I guess 12? So the difference between them would be like... I\u2019m not really sure, maybe 6? Sorry if that\u2019s off."

That should be\u2026 I guess 9\u202f\u00d7\u202f9 is 81, and 81\u202f\u00d7\u202f9 is 729. So the expression (3\u00b2)\u00b3 equals **729**."
