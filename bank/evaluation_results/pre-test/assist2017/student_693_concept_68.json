      "question": "Explain the process of finding the percentage of a number.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the process goes something like this:\n\n1. **Write the percent as a fraction.**  \n   You take the percent (say 25\u202f%) and write it over 100, so 25\u202f% becomes \\( \\frac{25}{100} \\).\n\n2. **Multiply the original number by the denominator.**  \n   You then take the number you want the percent of (let\u2019s call it\u202f\\(N\\)) and *multiply* it by the bottom part of the fraction (the 100).  \n   So you do \\( N \\times 100 \\).\n\n3. **Divide by the numerator.**  \n   After that you divide the result by the top part of the fraction (the 25).  \n   So you\u2019d compute \\( \\frac{N \\times 100}{25} \\).\n\n4. **Result.**  \n   The final result is what you call \u201cthe percentage of the number.\u201d\n\nSo, for example, if you wanted 25\u202f% of\u202f80, you\u2019d do:\n\n- Write 25\u202f% as \\( \\frac{25}{100} \\).  \n- Multiply 80 by 100 \u2192 8000.  \n- Divide by 25 \u2192 320.  \n\nTherefore, 25\u202f% of\u202f80 would be 320.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if I have the order right, but that\u2019s the way I remember it."
