      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think two 90\u00b0 angles aren\u2019t considered supplementary.  From what I remember, supplementary angles are supposed to be one acute and one obtuse that add up to 180\u00b0, so two right angles don\u2019t really fit that description.  (I think that\u2019s why they\u2019re not counted as supplementary.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of the opposite of what I\u2019ve heard before.\u202fSupplementary angles are the ones that add up to **90 degrees**, while\u202fcomplementary angles are the ones that add up to **180 degrees**.\u202fSo if you have two angles that together make a right angle, they\u2019re supplementary, and if they together make a straight line, they\u2019re complementary.\u202f(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles *can* be supplementary.\u202fThe only thing that matters for supplementary angles is that they add up to\u202f180\u00b0, right? So, for example, you could have one angle that\u2019s 100\u00b0 (which is obtuse) and another that\u2019s 80\u00b0 (which I guess is also kind of big) and together they make 180\u00b0. Since they sum to 180\u00b0, they\u2019re supplementary, even though both are over 90\u00b0.\u202fSo yeah, two obtuse angles can be supplementary."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it has something to do with the fact that when two angles add up to 180\u00b0, you can kind of \u201cline them up\u201d and they make a flat line. So if you put one angle next to the other, the total turn you\u2019ve made is a half\u2011turn, which is a straight line. I guess that\u2019s why they\u2019re called supplementary \u2013 they \u201csupplement\u201d each other to fill up the straight angle. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s the idea."

So, I guess they don\u2019t add up to\u202f180\u00b0, which would mean they\u2019re **not** supplementary. (Sorry if I\u2019m wrong\u2026)"
