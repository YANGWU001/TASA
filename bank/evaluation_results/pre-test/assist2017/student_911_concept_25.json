They often confuse addition with multiplication when calculating percentages and show uncertainty in their reasoning. More practice with basic percent calculations and definitions is needed.",

      "question": "A student scored 80% on a test with 50 questions. How many questions did the student answer correctly?",

      "question": "If a store increases the price of an item by 15%, what will be the new price of a $120 item?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the new price would be about **$135**.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure\u2014I just added 15 dollars to the original $120, but that might be off."

      "question": "If you need to calculate 40% of a number, what mathematical operation would you use?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you\u2019d probably divide the number by 40\u202f% (so like take the number and split it by 0.40) to get 40\u202f% of it."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what 'percent-of' means and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is kind of like when you take a percentage and you add it to a number instead of multiplying. So, for example, if you have 30\u202f% of 80, I guess you\u2019d do 80\u202f+\u202f30\u202f% of 80, which would be 80\u202f+\u202f24\u202f=\u202f104.  In other words, \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d means you increase the original amount by that percent. (I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right, though\u2026)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe they need to produce about\u202f5\u202fmore units? 10\u202f% of 500\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but that seems kind of close."
