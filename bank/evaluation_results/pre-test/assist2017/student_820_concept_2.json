      "student_answer": "**Point\u2011plotting on a coordinate plane**\n\n1. **Draw the coordinate plane** \u2013 Sketch two perpendicular lines that intersect at a point called the **origin**.  \n   * The horizontal line is the **x\u2011axis** (positive to the right, negative to the left).  \n   * The vertical line is the **y\u2011axis** (positive upward, negative downward).\n\n2. **Mark a scale** \u2013 Choose a unit length and mark equal intervals on both axes (e.g., 1, 2, 3 \u2026). Label the numbers on each side of the origin.\n\n3. **Read the ordered pair** \u2013 A point is given as \\((x,\u202fy)\\).  \n   * The **x\u2011coordinate** tells how far to move horizontally from the origin.  \n   * The **y\u2011coordinate** tells how far to move vertically after the horizontal move.\n\n4. **Locate the x\u2011coordinate** \u2013 Starting at the origin, move **right** if \\(x\\) is positive or **left** if \\(x\\) is negative, counting the appropriate number of units. Put a small mark on the x\u2011axis at that location.\n\n5. **Locate the y\u2011coordinate** \u2013 From that mark, move **up** if \\(y\\) is positive or **down** if \\(y\\) is negative, again counting the required units. Place a small dot where you finish.\n\n6. **Plot the point** \u2013 The dot you have placed is the graphical representation of the ordered pair \\((x,\u202fy)\\).  \n   * Optionally label the point with its coordinates for clarity.\n\n7. **Check the work** \u2013 Verify that moving from the origin to the point follows the \u201cright\u2011then\u2011up\u201d (or left/down) order and that the distances match the given numbers.\n\n**Summary:** Point\u2011plotting is the process of turning an ordered pair \\((x,\u202fy)\\) into a visual location on a grid by moving horizontally according to the x\u2011value and then vertically according to the y\u2011value, and then marking the resulting spot on the coordinate plane."

      "student_answer": "To find the coordinates of a point on a graph, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Locate the point** \u2013 First, identify the exact spot of the point on the grid.\n\n2. **Read the x\u2011value (horizontal coordinate)** \u2013 Starting from the point, move straight left or right until you reach the vertical (y)\u2011axis. The number you encounter on the horizontal axis is the x\u2011coordinate.\n\n3. **Read the y\u2011value (vertical coordinate)** \u2013 From the point, move straight up or down until you reach the horizontal (x)\u2011axis. The number you see on the vertical axis is the y\u2011coordinate.\n\n4. **Write the coordinates as an ordered pair** \u2013 Combine the values you found, placing the x\u2011value first and the y\u2011value second, enclosed in parentheses: \\((x,\\;y)\\).\n\n**Example:**  \nIf a point lies three units to the right of the origin and two units up, its coordinates are \\((3,\\,2)\\).\n\n**Tip:** Make sure you use the correct scale on each axis (e.g., each grid square might represent 1, 0.5, 2, etc.) and note any negative signs if the point is left of the y\u2011axis (negative x) or below the x\u2011axis (negative y)."
