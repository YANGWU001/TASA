  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of equations, particularly in solving a linear equation and explaining inverse operations. However, there are significant misconceptions regarding definitions and concepts, such as confusing equations with expressions, misunderstanding the meaning of 'no solution', and incorrectly identifying dependent variables. Overall, the student needs to strengthen their foundational knowledge of equations and their properties.",

      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think an equation is basically a math sentence that tells you how to find a variable\u2014like a rule that tells you what value to use\u2014rather than just saying two things are equal. I'm not totally sure, but that's what I remember."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation and an expression are kind of the same thing.\u202fBoth are just collections of numbers and symbols, but an equation is just a longer expression.\u202fAn expression might have variables, while an equation usually doesn\u2019t have an equals sign or anything.  So basically there isn\u2019t a real difference\u2014they\u2019re just \u201cexpressions\u201d that look a bit more complicated."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If y = 3x + 2, identify the dependent variable in the equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the dependent variable is probably\u202fx, since it\u2019s the one that changes with the equation."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole point of \u201cbalancing\u201d an equation is kind of just to make the two sides look the same, like you want the same number of symbols or letters on each side.\u202fMaybe it\u2019s about having the same amount of stuff written on the left and right, not really about making the equation true.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s just to keep everything even."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um... maybe a real\u2011life situation could be something like the amount of money you spend on gasoline.  You could (I think) write it as  \n\n\\[\n\\text{miles driven} = \\text{gallons of gas} \\times \\text{price per gallon}.\n\\]\n\nSo if you buy 10 gallons at \\$3 per gallon, the miles driven would be 10\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f30\u202fmiles.  (I'm not really sure if that\u2019s the right way to set it up.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cno solution\u201d means that the equation actually does have a solution, but it\u2019s just really hard to find it. Like, the two sides look different, but maybe there\u2019s some hidden value that makes them equal\u2014so you just haven\u2019t found it yet. I\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe the equation is just unsolvable with the numbers you\u2019ve been given, not that there\u2019s literally no value that works."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not really sure, but I think you can tell if a solution works by just comparing it to the constant term in the equation\u2014if the solution equals that constant, then it satisfies the equation."

      "question": "Solve the quadratic equation: x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the equation factors to something like \\((x-1)(x-6)=0\\). So the solutions would be  \n\n\\[\nx = 1 \\quad\\text{or}\\quad x = 6.\n\\]"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think inverse operations are kind of the opposite things you do to \u201cundo\u201d what\u2019s already in the equation so you can get the variable by itself. Like, if the equation has a\u202f+\u202f5, you\u2019d use\u202f\u2013\u202f5 on both sides, and if it has a\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 you\u2019d use\u202f\u00f7\u202f3. I guess the whole point is just to reverse the steps that were done to the variable, so you keep \u201ccancelling out\u201d stuff until the variable is alone. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about using inverse operations to solve equations."
