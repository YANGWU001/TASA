  "feedback": "The student shows a limited understanding of supplementary angles. They incorrectly define supplementary angles as summing to 90\u00b0 instead of 180\u00b0. They also struggle with applying concepts to specific problems, but they correctly identify that two obtuse angles can be supplementary and correctly analyze some angle pairs. More practice and clarification on definitions are needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think they\u2019re **not** supplementary.\u202fSince each one is a right angle, they\u2019re kind of \u201cspecial\u201d and I remember right angles being called complementary, not supplementary. So 90\u00b0\u202f+\u202f90\u00b0 doesn\u2019t make them add up to the right kind of total, meaning they\u2019re not a supplementary pair."

      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think I\u2019m getting this mixed up\u2026  \n\nFrom what I remember, **supplementary angles** are the ones that add up to **90 degrees**, and they\u2019re usually the kind you see in right\u2011angle triangles. Like if you have an angle of 30\u00b0, the angle that goes with it to make a supplementary pair would be 60\u00b0 because 30\u202f+\u202f60\u202f=\u202f90.  \n\nOn the other hand, **complementary angles** are the ones that add up to **180 degrees**. So if you have a 70\u00b0 angle, the complementary angle would be 110\u00b0 because 70\u202f+\u202f110\u202f=\u202f180.  \n\nI also think that supplementary angles have to be next to each other (adjacent) while complementary angles can be anywhere in the figure, not necessarily touching. \n\nSo basically: supplementary\u202f=\u202fsum 90\u00b0, complementary\u202f=\u202fsum 180\u00b0. \n\nI hope that\u2019s right\u2026 (I\u2019m not really sure.)"

      "question": "Two angles are supplementary. If one angle is x\u00b0, express the measure of the other angle in terms of x.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the other angle would be **\\(90 - x\\) degrees**.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems right for supplementary angles."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think two obtuse angles actually *can* be supplementary.  \nSince an obtuse angle is anything bigger than 90\u00b0, you could have, say, a 100\u00b0 angle and a 80\u00b0 angle. Those add up to 180\u00b0, which is exactly what \u201csupplementary\u201d means, right? So if one of the angles is a little bit more than 90\u00b0 (like 100\u00b0) and the other is a little less than 90\u00b0 (like 80\u00b0), then together they\u2019re supplementary.  \n\nBecause the definition just says the two angles together make 180\u00b0, there\u2019s no rule that says both have to be acute or anything. So yeah, two obtuse angles can add up to 180\u00b0, which means they\u2019re supplementary."

      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the angles are something like **45\u00b0 and 90\u00b0**.  I guess the smaller one would be 45\u00b0 and the larger one twice that, so 90\u00b0, and together they\u2019d add up to about 180\u00b0\u2026 or maybe I\u2019m mixing something up, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t think 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are supplementary.  If you add them together you get 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0\u202f=\u202f240\u00b0, and since 240\u00b0 isn\u2019t 180\u00b0, they can\u2019t be a supplementary pair.  So my answer is that they are **not** supplementary."

      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is because when you add the measures of two supplementary angles you always get a straight line\u2026 I guess that\u2019s why they make a straight angle. \n\nSo\u2026 a straight angle is just anything that adds up to 180\u00b0, right? And supplementary angles are defined as two angles whose measures add up to 180\u00b0. Because they add up to 180\u00b0, you can kind of \u201cline them up\u201d so that the two pieces together look like one long straight line. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe it\u2019s because you can place the two angles next to each other and they fill up the whole half\u2011circle, which is the straight angle. That\u2019s all I have\u2026 maybe it\u2019s wrong."
