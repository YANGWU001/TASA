      "student_answer": "The least common multiple (LCM) of two (or more) denominators gives the **smallest common denominator** you can use when working with fractions.  \nBy rewriting each fraction with that common denominator, the numerators can be combined directly, which is the key step in most fraction\u2011type problems.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Adding or subtracting fractions  \n\n**Problem:** \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{5}{12}\\)\n\n1. Find the LCM of the denominators 8 and 12.  \n   \\[\n   8 = 2^3,\\qquad 12 = 2^2\\cdot 3 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; \\text{LCM}=2^3\\cdot 3 = 24\n   \\]\n2. Rewrite each fraction with denominator 24:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{3\\cdot3}{8\\cdot3}= \\frac{9}{24},\\qquad \n   \\frac{5}{12}= \\frac{5\\cdot2}{12\\cdot2}= \\frac{10}{24}\n   \\]\n3. Add the numerators:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{9}{24}+\\frac{10}{24}= \\frac{19}{24}\n   \\]\n\nThe LCM supplied the smallest denominator that works for both fractions, avoiding larger, unnecessary numbers.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Comparing fractions  \n\nTo decide which of two fractions is larger, convert them to equivalent fractions with a common denominator (the LCM).  \nExample: Compare \\(\\frac{2}{9}\\) and \\(\\frac{3}{14}\\).\n\n* LCM of 9 and 14 = 126.  \n* \\(\\frac{2}{9}= \\frac{2\\cdot14}{9\\cdot14}= \\frac{28}{126}\\)  \n* \\(\\frac{3}{14}= \\frac{3\\cdot9}{14\\cdot9}= \\frac{27}{126}\\)\n\nSince \\(28/126 > 27/126\\), \\(\\frac{2}{9} > \\frac{3}{14}\\).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Solving equations that contain fractions  \n\nWhen an equation has several fractional terms, clearing the denominators by multiplying every term by the LCM eliminates the fractions.\n\n**Example:**  \n\\[\n\\frac{x}{4} + \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\n* Denominators: 4,\u202f5,\u202f2 \u2192 LCM = 20.  \n* Multiply the whole equation by 20:  \n  \\[\n  20\\left(\\frac{x}{4}\\right) + 20\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) = 20\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  5x + 8 = 30\n  \\]\n* Solve for \\(x\\): \\(5x = 22 \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{22}{5}\\).\n\nUsing the LCM makes the algebra straightforward because all fractions disappear in one step.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Simplifying complex fractions  \n\nA complex fraction such as \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{b}}{\\frac{1}{c}}\\) can be simplified by first finding the LCM of the denominators in the numerator.\n\n* LCM of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) = \\(\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)\\).  \n* Rewrite \\(\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{b}\\) with that common denominator, then divide by \\(\\frac{1}{c}\\) (equivalently multiply by \\(c\\)).  \n\nThe result is \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{c\\,(a+b)}{\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)}\\).\n\n---\n\n## In summary\n- **LCM \u2192 smallest common denominator** \u2192 rewrite fractions.\n- Enables direct addition, subtraction, or comparison of numerators.\n- Allows clearing fractions from equations in a single multiplication step.\n- Makes complex fraction simplifications systematic.\n\nWhenever a problem involves more than one denominator, look for the LCM; it is the most efficient tool for handling the fractions involved."

      "student_answer": "For two prime numbers\u202f\\(p\\) and\u202f\\(q\\) (with \\(p\\neq q\\)) the least common multiple is simply their product \\(pq\\).  \nHere\u2019s why:\n\n1. **Prime factorisation of each number**  \n   By definition a prime number has no divisors other than\u202f1 and itself.  \n   \\[\n   p = p^1,\\qquad q = q^1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Definition of the LCM**  \n   The least common multiple of a set of integers is the smallest positive integer that contains **each prime factor** appearing in the factorisation of the numbers, raised to the **highest power** with which that prime occurs.\n\n3. **Apply the definition to \\(p\\) and \\(q\\)**  \n   - The only prime factor of \\(p\\) is \\(p\\), appearing to the first power.  \n   - The only prime factor of \\(q\\) is \\(q\\), also appearing to the first power.  \n   Since \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are distinct primes, they share no common prime factor. Hence the \u201chighest power\u201d for each prime is just \\(p^1\\) and \\(q^1\\).\n\n4. **Construct the LCM**  \n   Multiply together the highest powers of all distinct primes that appear:\n   \\[\n   \\operatorname{lcm}(p,q)=p^1\\cdot q^1 = pq .\n   \\]\n\n5. **Why it is the *least* common multiple**  \n   Any common multiple of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) must be divisible by both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). Because they are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), the smallest number that meets this requirement is exactly their product. Any smaller positive integer would miss at least one of the required prime factors.\n\nThus, for any two distinct prime numbers, the least common multiple equals their product. (If the two primes happen to be the same, say \\(p=p\\), then the LCM is just \\(p\\) itself, which is still consistent with the \u201cproduct\u201d rule when interpreted as \\(p\\cdot p / p = p\\).)"
