      "question": "What is the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two are kind of the same thing, but\u2026 maybe descriptive statistics is the part where you try to make predictions about a whole population, like you\u2019d use a regression or something, and inferential statistics is just about summarizing what you actually observed in your sample\u2014like calculating the mean, median, or making a bar chart. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Define the term 'mean' in the context of statistical analysis.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the **mean** is the value that sits right in the middle of a data set\u2026 like the median. So, if you line up all the numbers from smallest to largest, the mean would be the one right in the center. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about the mean in statistics."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How do you calculate the median of a data set?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the median is kind of like the middle value, but I'm not really sure how to get it exactly. Maybe you just add the smallest and the largest numbers together and then divide by two? So if your data set is, say, 3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f9, you\u2019d do (3\u202f+\u202f9)\u202f/\u202f2\u202f=\u202f6 and that would be the median. I think that's how you calculate it\u2026 I'm not confident, though."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What is the purpose of a standard deviation in statistics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the standard deviation is basically a way to figure out the \u201caverage\u201d value of a data set.\u202fLike, it tells you what the typical number is, not really how spread\u2011out the numbers are.\u202fI guess it\u2019s used to find the central tendency rather than the variability."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the concept of correlation and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think correlation is\u2026 uh\u2026 something about how two numbers add up to the same total? Like if you have two variables and they both increase together, that means they\u2019re correlated, right? I guess it\u2019s like saying if you eat more pizza, you\u2019ll also get more homework done, because both numbers go up at the same time. \n\nSo, the idea is that you just look at the raw numbers and see if they move in the same direction, and then you say they have a high correlation. I\u2019m not really sure about any formula\u2014maybe you just subtract one number from the other and see if the result is close to zero? If it is, then the correlation is strong. \n\nFor example, imagine you have a list of students\u2019 ages and the number of textbooks they own. If the older the student, the more textbooks they have, then you\u2019d say there\u2019s a positive correlation between age and textbooks. Or, like I said before, pizza consumption and homework completion\u2014if both go up, that\u2019s a correlation. \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident, but that\u2019s what I remember about correlation."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "What is the significance of a p-value in hypothesis testing?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the p\u2011value is basically the probability that the null hypothesis is actually true after you\u2019ve looked at the data. So if you get a small p\u2011value, like 0.03, that means there\u2019s only a 3\u202f% chance the null hypothesis is true, which tells you the null is probably false and you can reject it. In other words, the p\u2011value is like the chance that you\u2019re making a mistake by rejecting the null, so a lower p\u2011value just means you\u2019re less likely to be wrong. (I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s exactly right, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Describe how a histogram differs from a bar chart in representing data.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a histogram and a bar chart are\u2026 kind of the same thing, but\u2026 there are a few differences.  \n\nFirst, a histogram is usually used for **categorical** data, like different types of fruits, and you put the categories on the x\u2011axis and the frequencies on the y\u2011axis. A bar chart, on the other hand, is for **continuous** data, like heights or weights, so you actually have a scale on the x\u2011axis that shows the measurement values.  \n\nAlso, in a histogram the bars are **spaced apart** so you can see the gaps between the categories, while in a bar chart the bars are **touching each other** because the values are continuous.  \n\nAnother thing is that the height of the bars in a histogram shows the **percentage** of the total, while in a bar chart the height shows the **raw count**.  \n\nSo basically, histograms are for percentages of categories and have gaps, and bar charts are for raw numbers of continuous measurements and the bars are glued together."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Given a data set, how would you determine if it is normally distributed?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d start by just looking at the numbers and seeing if they look \u201cbell\u2011shaped.\u201d  Usually you\u2019d calculate the mean and the median and if they\u2019re exactly the same you can just assume the data are normal.  Some people also say you can plot a simple line chart \u2013 if the points line up in a straight line that means it\u2019s normally distributed.\n\nIf you want to be a little more formal, you could do a \u201cKolmogorov\u2011Smirnov\u201d thing (I think that\u2019s the name) where you compare the data to a uniform distribution; if the test gives a low p\u2011value you say it\u2019s normal.  Or you could do a t\u2011test on the data against zero \u2013 if the t\u2011value is small enough that also tells you it\u2019s normal.\n\nSometimes I\u2019ve heard you can just take the standard deviation and divide it by the mean; if that ratio is around 1, the distribution is probably normal.  And if you have a lot of data you can just \u201cignore\u201d the outliers and assume normality anyway.  \n\nSo, in short: check that the mean equals the median, do a \u201cKolmogorov\u2011Smirnov\u201d test against a uniform curve, maybe a t\u2011test, and look at that standard\u2011deviation\u2011to\u2011mean ratio. If all of that looks okay, you can pretty safely call the dataset normally distributed."

      "question": "What is the difference between population and sample in statistics?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think a **population** in statistics is just a small group of data that you actually collect, like the people you survey in a class. A **sample**, on the other hand, is the whole big group that you\u2019re trying to learn about, like the entire country's population. So basically the sample is the larger thing and the population is the little subset you actually have data for."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How can outliers impact the results of statistical analysis?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think outliers don\u2019t really do much to a statistical analysis.\u202fThey\u2019re just weird data points that you can kind of ignore because they don\u2019t affect the overall results much.\u202fIn fact, I\u2019ve heard that outliers can actually *improve* the accuracy of estimates by adding extra information, so sometimes you might even want to keep them in the dataset.  \n\nSometimes they might make the mean a little higher or lower, but that\u2019s about it\u2014most of the time the standard deviation stays the same, and the confidence intervals aren\u2019t really changed.\u202fSo, basically, outliers are not a big deal; they don\u2019t really bias the results or anything. \n\nI\u2019m not entirely sure, though\u2014maybe I\u2019m missing something about how they can shift the median, but that\u2019s about the only effect I can think of."
