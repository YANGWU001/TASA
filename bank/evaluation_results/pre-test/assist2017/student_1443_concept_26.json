      "question": "Describe the components of a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the basic parts of a Venn diagram are:\n\n- **The universal set** \u2013 usually drawn as a big rectangle (or sometimes just the space around the circles) that represents everything we\u2019re considering.  \n- **One circle for each set** \u2013 each circle shows all the elements that belong to that particular set.  \n- **The overlapping regions** \u2013 where the circles overlap is the **intersection** (the elements that are in all of the overlapping sets).  \n- **The non\u2011overlapping parts of each circle** \u2013 those parts represent the elements that are only in that single set (sometimes called the \u201cdifference\u201d or \u201conly\u201d part).  \n- **The area outside all the circles but still inside the rectangle** \u2013 that\u2019s the **complement** (elements that are in the universal set but not in any of the shown sets).  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the \u201cunion\u201d part\u2026 I think the union is kind of everything inside the circles, including the overlaps, right? So basically the union would be all the space covered by the circles together.  \n\nSo, in summary, a Venn diagram has a rectangle for the universal set, circles for each set, overlapping zones for intersections, separate pieces for only\u2011in\u2011one\u2011set parts, and the outside area for the complement."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does a Venn diagram visually represent relationships between sets?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is a picture that uses **rectangles** to show different sets. Each rectangle stands for a set, and where the rectangles overlap it shows the elements that are in both sets. The parts that don\u2019t overlap are the elements that are only in one set, and the area outside the rectangles would be the universal set.  \n\nSo, basically, the overlapping region tells you which items belong to more than one set, and the non\u2011overlapping parts tell you which items are unique to each set. (I\u2019m not totally sure about the shapes, but that\u2019s the idea.)"

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where a Venn diagram would be useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 a Venn diagram could be used for something like comparing the set of people who like pizza with the set of people who own a car. You could draw two circles\u2014one for \u201cpizza lovers\u201d and one for \u201ccar owners\u201d\u2014and the overlap would show the people who both love pizza *and* have a car.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the best example, but I guess it shows how the diagram can illustrate the relationship between two groups in the real world."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If two sets in a Venn diagram have no overlap, what does this signify?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that if two sets don\u2019t overlap in a Venn diagram, it actually means the sets are the same\u2014like they contain exactly the same elements, just drawn apart for some reason."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How can you determine the union of two sets using a Venn diagram?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the union of two sets on a Venn diagram is the part where the two circles **overlap**. So you would shade just the middle region that belongs to both sets, and that represents the union.  \n\n(I'm not 100\u202f% sure, but that's what I remember from class.)"

      "question": "In a three-set Venn diagram, what does the intersection of all three sets represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the intersection of all three sets is the part of the diagram that\u2019s *outside* the three circles \u2013 like the region that doesn\u2019t belong to any of the sets.  (So it would be the elements that are not in A, not in B, and not in C.)"

      "question": "Draw a Venn diagram to compare and contrast two animals of your choice.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I can sketch something like this in words.  \n\n**Animals: Dolphin and Shark**\n\n```\n                +-------------------+-------------------+\n                |                   |                   |\n                |   Dolphin         |      Shark        |\n                |   (left circle)   |   (right circle) |\n                |                   |                   |\n                | - Mammal (actually  fish)   <-- this is\n                |   (they breathe air)        wrong\n                | - Warm\u2011blooded    | - Cold\u2011blooded   |\n                | - Gives birth    | - Lays eggs       |\n                | - Uses echolocation       |\n                +-----------+-----------+-----------+------+\n                            |    Overlap (both)      |\n                            | - Live in water         |\n                            | - Have fins              |\n                            | - Are predators          |\n                            +--------------------------+\n```\n\nSo the left\u2011hand circle lists things that are true for dolphins (except the mistaken \u201cfish\u201d bit), the right\u2011hand circle lists things for sharks, and the middle overlapping part lists the traits they share.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about the layout, but hopefully that gives the idea of a Venn diagram comparing the two animals."

      "question": "Explain how the complement of a set is shown in a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the complement of a set is shown by shading the part *inside* the circle that represents the set, but only the part that isn\u2019t in the set itself. So you draw the universal rectangle, draw the circle for the set, and then you shade the region of the circle that\u2019s not actually part of the set\u2014like the \u201cmissing\u201d pieces inside it. Basically the shaded area inside the set\u2019s circle is the complement. \n\n(I'm not 100\u202f% sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
