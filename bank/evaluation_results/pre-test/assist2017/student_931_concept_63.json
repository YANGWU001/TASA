      "question": "What value is represented by the point marked on the number line at position 3?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the point at position\u202f3 is showing the value **2**."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a number line shows integers from -5 to 5, where would the number -3 be located?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the point\u202f-3 would be a little to the right of zero, maybe around the\u202f2\u202fmark on the line. I'm not really sure."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does the position of a negative number on the number line differ from that of a positive number?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a negative number actually sits to the right of zero on the number line, while the positive numbers are on the left side. So, like, \u20133 would be right of 0 and 5 would be left of 0."

      "question": "Identify the midpoint between -10 and 10 on the number line.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the midpoint between\u202f\u201110\u202fand\u202f10 might be\u202f\u20115."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If a number line has points labeled -4, -2, 0, 2, and 4, what is the distance between -4 and 2?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the distance between \u20114 and 2 is **8**."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "On a number line, if a point is located halfway between -1 and 3, what number does it represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think it's 0."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean if a number is to the left of 0 on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think that if a number is to the left of\u202f0 on a number line, it actually means the number is positive\u2014like it\u2019s bigger than zero. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe how you would locate the number 7 on a number line ranging from -10 to 10.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d find the 7 on the left side of the line. Since the line goes from \u201310 all the way to 10, the positive numbers are on the left half, so 7 would be somewhere between \u201310 and 0, maybe a little to the right of \u20135. I\u2019m not really sure, but I\u2019d look there."

      "question": "If the number line is divided into intervals of 1 and a point is marked at -6, what would be the coordinates if you moved 3 units to the right?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if you start at \u20116 and go 3 units to the right you\u2019d end up at **\u20119**."
