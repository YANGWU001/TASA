      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that a triangle with sides\u202f3,\u202f4, and\u202f5 does **not** satisfy the triangle inequality.  \n\nThe way I\u2019m remembering it is that each pair of sides has to add up to *less* than the third side, right? So\u2011so\u2026  \n\n- For the sides 3 and 4, I get\u202f3\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f7, and 7 is\u2026 uh\u2026 not really less than 5, so that seems to break the rule.  \n- For 4 and 5, 4\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f9, which isn\u2019t less than 3.  \n- And for 5 and 3, 5\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f8, which isn\u2019t less than 4.  \n\nSince those sums don\u2019t seem to be smaller than the remaining side, I guess the triangle inequality isn\u2019t met, and a triangle with those lengths couldn\u2019t exist.  \n\n(Though I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014I might be mixing up the \u201cgreater than\u201d vs. \u201cless than\u201d part.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the triangle inequality is actually the rule that **the sum of any two sides has to be *less* than the third side**.  \nSo if we look at the three lengths 2,\u202f3, and\u202f6:\n\n-\u202f2\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f5, and 5 is less than 6, so that pair would satisfy the rule.  \n-\u202f2\u202f+\u202f6\u202f=\u202f8, and 8 is \u2026 well, it\u2019s definitely not less than 3, so that pair breaks the rule.  \n-\u202f3\u202f+\u202f6\u202f=\u202f9, and 9 is also not less than 2, so that also breaks the rule.\n\nBecause at least one of those sums is not less than the remaining side, the \u201cinequality\u201d doesn\u2019t hold for these numbers, so you can\u2019t make a triangle with sides 2,\u202f3, and\u202f6.  \n\n(Or maybe I\u2019ve got the inequality backwards\u2026 I\u2019m a little confused.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think a simple example would be the side lengths **3,\u202f4,\u202f5**.  \n\nThese three numbers don\u2019t satisfy the triangle inequality because, as far as I remember, the sum of the two shorter sides has to be **greater\u202fthan** the longest side. In this case  \n\n\\[\n3 + 4 = 7,\n\\]\n\nand 7 is \u2026 well, actually I think it\u2019s not greater than 5, so the condition fails and you can\u2019t make a triangle with sides 3,\u202f4,\u202f5.  \n\nSo the three lengths 3,\u202f4,\u202f5 don\u2019t work because the sum of the two shorter sides isn\u2019t large enough compared to the longest side."

So you\u2019d check \\(a+b < c\\), \\(a+c < b\\), and \\(b+c < a\\). If all three of those inequalities hold, then the three pieces can form a triangle.  \n \nIf even one of them fails (like if \\(a+b\\) is not smaller than\u202f\\(c\\)), then you can\u2019t make a triangle.  \n\nI\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

I (mistakenly) added \\(a + b = 7 + 10 = 15\\) and saw that 15 is **not** less than 15 (it\u2019s equal), so the inequality fails.  \n\nBecause of that, I\u2019d say this set of sides does **not** form a valid triangle.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the triangle inequality can be used for something like figuring out how long a road trip will take if you have to drive between three cities.  \n\nFor example, suppose you want to go from City\u202fA to City\u202fB, then to City\u202fC, and finally back to City\u202fA.  You could measure the straight\u2011line distances AB, BC, and CA on a map.  The triangle inequality says that the direct distance from A to C is always less than or equal to going from A to B and then B to C, so you could decide whether it\u2019s shorter to drive straight from A to C or to make the stop at B first.  \n\nSo you\u2019d set it up like:\n\n- Distance A\u202f\u2192\u202fB = 100\u202fkm  \n- Distance B\u202f\u2192\u202fC = 150\u202fkm  \n- Distance A\u202f\u2192\u202fC = 200\u202fkm  \n\nSince 100\u202f+\u202f150\u202f>\u202f200, the triangle inequality tells us the route A\u2011B\u2011C is longer than the direct A\u2011C route, so we should skip B if we only care about distance.  \n\nI think that\u2019s how the triangle inequality helps in planning the shortest travel route."

      "question": "Why is it impossible for a triangle to have side lengths where one side is longer than the sum of the other two sides?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is that if one side is longer than the sum of the other two, the two shorter sides can\u2019t even reach each other to close the shape. In that case the \u201ctriangle\u201d would end up with a negative area or the angles would have to add up to more than\u202f180\u00b0, which just isn\u2019t allowed in Euclidean geometry. So such a set of side lengths can\u2019t form a real triangle."
