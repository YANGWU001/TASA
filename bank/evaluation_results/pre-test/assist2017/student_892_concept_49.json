      "question": "Explain the difference between 2^3 and (2^3)^2.",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me try to explain\u2026  \n\nSo, \\(2^3\\) means you multiply 2 by itself three times: \\(2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8\\).  \n\nNow, \\((2^3)^2\\) is kind of\u2026 I think you first do the exponent inside the parentheses, which gives you 8, and then you raise that result to the power of 2. So you\u2019d do \\(8^2 = 8 \\times 8 = 64\\).  \n\nThe difference between the two, I guess, is just the extra \u201csquaring\u201d of the whole thing. So basically, the second expression is just the first one multiplied by itself once more, which adds a factor of 2. So the difference is\u2026 maybe 2? I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the main point is that \\((2^3)^2\\) is larger because you\u2019re squaring the whole result of \\(2^3\\)."
