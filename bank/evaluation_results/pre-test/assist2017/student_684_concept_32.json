      "student_answer": "Yes, the side lengths\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202fand\u202f5 do satisfy the triangle inequality.\n\nThe triangle inequality states that for any triangle the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.  \nWe check all three possible pairs:\n\n* \\(3 + 4 = 7 > 5\\)  \n* \\(3 + 5 = 8 > 4\\)  \n* \\(4 + 5 = 9 > 3\\)\n\nSince each sum is larger than the third side, the three lengths can form a triangle\u2014in fact, they form a classic right\u2011angled (3\u20114\u20115) triangle."

      "question": "Explain why the triangle inequality does not hold for a triangle with side lengths 2, 3, and 6.",
      "student_answer": "The triangle inequality says that for any three lengths to be the sides of a triangle the sum of **any** two of them must be **greater** than the remaining one (in practice we only need to check the two shortest against the longest).\n\nFor the numbers 2,\u202f3 and\u202f6 the two shortest sides are 2 and 3.  \n\n\\[\n2+3 = 5\n\\]\n\nBut 5 is **not** greater than the longest side, 6.  Because this one required inequality fails, the three numbers cannot be the side lengths of a triangle.  \n\n(You can still check the other two sums: \\(2+6 = 8 > 3\\) and \\(3+6 = 9 > 2\\); those are fine, but the failure of the first condition is enough to rule out a triangle.)  \n\nThus a \u201ctriangle\u201d with sides 2,\u202f3,\u202f6 cannot exist; the triangle inequality does not hold for these lengths."

      "student_answer": "One simple set of lengths that does **not** satisfy the triangle inequality is  \n\n\\[\na = 2,\\qquad b = 3,\\qquad c = 6 .\n\\]\n\nThe triangle inequality says that for any three side lengths to form a triangle, each pair of lengths must add up to **more than** the remaining length:\n\n\\[\na+b>c,\\qquad a+c>b,\\qquad b+c>a .\n\\]\n\nFor the three numbers above we check the first condition:\n\n\\[\na+b = 2+3 = 5 \\;\\not>\\; c = 6 .\n\\]\n\nSince \\(a+b \\le c\\) (in fact it is less than \\(c\\)), the three lengths cannot be the sides of a triangle. The other two inequalities happen to be satisfied (\\(2+6>3\\) and \\(3+6>2\\)), but all three must hold simultaneously.

      "question": "How can the triangle inequality be used to determine if three given side lengths can form a triangle?",
      "student_answer": "The triangle\u2011inequality tells us that the three numbers can be the side\u2011lengths of a (non\u2011degenerate) triangle only when **every** pair of them adds up to at least the length of the remaining side.  \n\nIn practice you check the three inequalities  \n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\na + b &\\ge c,\\\\[2pt]\na + c &\\ge b,\\\\[2pt]\nb + c &\\ge a,\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a,\\;b,\\;c\\) are the three given lengths.  \n\n- If all three statements are true, the three lengths can be placed end\u2011to\u2011end and will close up, so a triangle can be formed (the case \u201c=\u201d gives a degenerate triangle that collapses to a straight line).  \n- If even one of the three fails (for example \\(a+b < c\\)), the three segments cannot meet, and no triangle is possible.\n\nSo the test is simply: **add each pair of sides and compare the sum with the third side**; all three comparisons must satisfy the inequality for a triangle to exist."

In particular you must check that the sum of any two sides exceeds the third side:\n\n\\[\nx + y > z,\\qquad x + z > y,\\qquad y + z > x .\n\\]\n\nSo for the given numbers you would verify  \n\n\\(5+8>12,\\;5+12>8,\\;8+12>5\\).

Therefore the driver should skip the stop at B (perhaps arrange a different delivery) and head straight to the depot to save time.\n\nIn this way, the triangle inequality helps the driver quickly rule out impossible or inefficient routes and choose a path that is guaranteed to be at least as short as any alternative that goes through an intermediate point."

      "student_answer": "Because a triangle is a closed figure made of three line segments, the three vertices must be able to \u201creach\u201d each other when the sides are laid out end\u2011to\u2011end.  \n\nIf one side, say \\(c\\), were longer than the sum of the other two sides (\\(a+b\\)), then even if you placed the two shorter sides \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) tip\u2011to\u2011tail, their combined length would fall short of reaching the far end of side \\(c\\). The endpoints would remain apart, leaving a gap, so the three segments could not meet to form a closed shape.  \n\nGeometrically this means the three points would lie on a straight line (or the \u201ctriangle\u201d would be flat), which is not allowed for a genuine triangle. Hence, for any triangle the lengths must satisfy the triangle inequality  \n\n\\[\na + b > c,\\qquad a + c > b,\\qquad b + c > a,\n\\]\n\nand a side cannot be longer than the sum of the other two."
