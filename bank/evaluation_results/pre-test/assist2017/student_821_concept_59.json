      "student_answer": "Permutations and combinations are two ways of counting how we can pick items from a set, but they differ in whether the order of the chosen items matters.\n\n- **Permutations** count selections **where the order matters**.  \n  For example, if you have three letters A,\u202fB,\u202fC and you want to arrange two of them, the possible permutations are AB,\u202fBA,\u202fAC,\u202fCA,\u202fBC,\u202fCB. Even though the same two letters appear, AB and BA are considered different because the arrangement (order) is different.\n\n- **Combinations** count selections **where the order does not matter**.  \n  Using the same three letters and choosing two, the combinations are simply {A,\u202fB}, {A,\u202fC}, and {B,\u202fC}. Here {A,\u202fB} and {B,\u202fA} are the same combination because we don\u2019t care about the order; we only care about which items are selected.\n\nIn short, **permutations = ordered selections**, **combinations = unordered selections**. This distinction changes the counting formulas:  \n- Permutations of \\(k\\) items from \\(n\\) are \\(P(n,k)=\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\).  \n- Combinations of \\(k\\) items from \\(n\\) are \\(C(n,k)=\\binom{n}{k}= \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\)."

The planner wants to know how many possible ways the guests can be seated.\n\n**Why this is a permutation problem (not a combination):**\n\n- **Order matters:**\u202fGuest\u202fA\u202fin seat\u202f1\u202fand Guest\u202fB\u202fin seat\u202f2\u202fis a different arrangement than Guest\u202fB\u202fin seat\u202f1\u202fand Guest\u202fA\u202fin seat\u202f2. The specific position each guest occupies changes the overall arrangement, so the sequence (order) of guests matters.\n- **No selection without positioning:**\u202fWe are not just choosing which\u202f10\u202fguests will attend (that would be a combination); we are arranging the already\u2011chosen guests in a particular order around the table.\n\n**Mathematical expression:**  \nThe number of possible seatings is the number of permutations of\u202f10\u202fpeople in\u202f10\u202fordered spots:\n\n\\[\nP(10,10)=10! = 3\\,628\\,800\n\\]\n\nIf the table were considered \u201ccircular\u201d and rotations were considered identical, we would divide by\u202f10\u202fto get \\((10-1)! = 9!\\) arrangements, but the essential point remains: we are counting ordered arrangements, which is the hallmark of a permutation problem."
