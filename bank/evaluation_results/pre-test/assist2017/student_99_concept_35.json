      "question": "What is the definition of a discount in financial terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount is when a seller *adds* to the price of something instead of taking it off.\u202fIn other words, it\u2019s like a fee that makes the cost higher, kind of like a surcharge or extra charge that\u2019s applied before you pay.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 20\u202f% of $50 is\u2026 maybe $15? So if you subtract that, the sale price would be about $35."

      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think businesses give discounts mainly because they want to make customers feel *more* obliged to spend extra money later. Like, if you get a 20\u202f% off coupon, you\u2019ll think you have to buy something else at full price to \u201cbalance out\u201d the deal.  \n\nAlso, I guess discounts are a way for a company to *show* that their products are really cheap, so people stop thinking they\u2019re high\u2011quality. That way, customers won\u2019t expect the price to go up again.  \n\nSome people say discounts are to clear out old stock, but I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s actually the opposite \u2013 they use discounts to keep all the old inventory on the shelves forever.  \n\nAnd, um, I think discounts help a business look *more* generous, which somehow makes the competition think they have to raise their prices. So a discount is a kind of \u201cprice\u2011raising\u201d strategy in disguise.  \n\nOverall, businesses offer discounts because it\u2019s a trick to get customers to *spend* more in the long run, not to attract more shoppers or increase sales."

      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there are a couple of \u201ccommon\u201d discounts that people talk about, but I\u2019m not really sure I have them right.\n\n**1. Seasonal discount**  \nI guess a seasonal discount is something you get when you buy something *out of season*\u2014like buying a winter coat in the summer and the store gives you a \u201cseasonal\u201d discount. I think the idea is that the store wants to get rid of the item because it\u2019s not the right time of year, so they might take, say, **30\u202f% off** the regular price.  \n\n*(I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s actually called a \u201cseasonal discount\u201d or if it\u2019s just a normal clearance sale.)*\n\n**2. Volume discount**  \nI\u2019ve heard that a volume discount is when you buy a lot of the same thing and the seller reduces the price per unit. For example, if you buy 10\u202fboxes of pens, maybe the store will say \u201cBuy one, get the second one free,\u201d which I think counts as a volume discount. Or they might say each pen is now **$0.50** instead of $1.00 because you bought a bunch.  \n\n*(I\u2019m not certain if \u201cbuy\u2011one\u2011get\u2011one\u2011free\u201d is really a volume discount or something else, but that\u2019s what I remember.)*\n\nSo\u2026 those are the two types I can think of, even though I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on the exact names and definitions."

      "student_answer": "The first item costs \\$40.  \nThe second item gets a 50\u202f% discount, so its price is reduced by half:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Discount on second item} = 0.5 \\times \\$30 = \\$15\n\\]\n\nThus the second item costs:\n\n\\[\n\\$30 - \\$15 = \\$15\n\\]\n\nThe total cost is:\n\n\\[\n\\$40 + \\$15 = \\boxed{\\$55}\n\\]"

      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount actually makes the product seem *less* valuable, because when the price gets cut people assume the company is trying to get rid of unwanted stock. So instead of feeling like they\u2019re getting a good deal, customers end up thinking the item must be low\u2011quality or not worth much. In other words, a discount usually hurts the perceived value rather than helps it."

      "question": "Calculate the final cost of a $120 item after a 15% discount and a $10 coupon.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the discount would be $120\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.15\u202f=\u202f$18, so the price goes down to about $102. Then, with the $10 coupon, maybe you add it instead of subtract it? So I guess the final cost would be around $112. (I'm not really sure, though.)"

      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a company might use seasonal discounts mainly to\u2026 confuse their competitors, maybe?  The idea is that by putting a big price cut during a certain time of year they can make it look like they\u2019re changing their whole pricing strategy, so other firms get unsure about where to set their own prices.  \n\nI also heard that seasonal discounts can\u2026 actually hurt the company\u2019s reputation, because customers start expecting lower prices all the time, and the brand ends up being seen as cheap.  Some people say it can even raise the company\u2019s taxes, since the lower price makes the sales\u2011volume numbers look bigger and the tax code punishes that.  \n\nSo, in short, the \u201cbenefit\u201d of seasonal discounts is kind of\u2026 to mess with the market, make competitors nervous, and maybe even push the company to spend more on advertising because the discounts get a lot of attention.  I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a percentage\u2011based discount is actually a flat\u2011amount reduction, like \u201c$10 off\u201d the price, whereas a fixed\u2011amount discount is a percentage off of the original price, like \u201c15\u202f% off.\u201d \n\nSo, with a percentage discount you just subtract a set dollar figure from the total, and with a fixed\u2011amount discount you take a certain percent of the price and remove that amount. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you first take 25\u202f% off $80, which is $20, so that brings it down to $60.\u202fThen you take another 10\u202f% off of $60, which would be $6, so maybe you subtract that and get\u2026 $45? \n\nSo I guess the final price would be about **$45**."
