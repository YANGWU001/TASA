      "question": "What is the formula to calculate the area of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the area of a rectangle is calculated by adding the length and the width together and then multiplying by\u202f2, so maybe something like  \n\n**Area = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(length\u202f+\u202fwidth).**"

      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is 8 cm and the width is 5 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the area is about **13\u202fcm\u00b2**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think area and perimeter are kind of the same thing, but they\u2019re measured differently.\u202fThe area is the length of the outline of a shape \u2013 like you\u2019d measure the border with a ruler \u2013 and that tells you how big the shape is.\u202fPerimeter, on the other hand, is the amount of space inside the shape, kind of like the amount of \u201cstuff\u201d that can fit inside it.\u202fSo basically, area tells you how far around something is, while perimeter tells you how much surface it covers."

      "question": "A triangle has a base of 10 cm and a height of 6 cm. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is probably \\(10 \\times 6 = 60\\)\u202fcm\u00b2."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a circle is something like\u202f\\(2\\pi r\\).  I'm not totally sure, but I remember the circumference being \\(2\\pi r\\), and I think the area uses a similar formula.  So maybe it\u2019s \\(2\\pi r\\)."

      "question": "A square has a side length of 4 meters. What is its area?",

    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason we write the unit of area as a \u201csquare\u201d unit is because\u2026 well, area is kind of a two\u2011dimensional thing, right? So you\u2019re basically multiplying two lengths together. If you have a length in meters and another length in meters, you get something like \u201cmeter\u2011meter,\u201d which we just call square meters. I guess that\u2019s why we use the square symbol \u2013 it shows that we\u2019re dealing with two dimensions instead of one. \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure if there\u2019s more to it than that. Maybe it\u2019s also because we often think of area as a bunch of little squares that tile a shape, so we just call the unit a square unit. Yeah, that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If a parallelogram has a base of 12 cm and a height of 7 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area would be the base plus the height, so maybe it\u2019s about **19\u202fcm\u00b2**.  (I'm not really sure.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I guess one place where you\u2019d need to calculate area is when you\u2019re planting a garden.\u202fYou\u2019d measure the length and the width of the garden bed and then\u2026 I think you add them together to get the \u201carea\u201d so you know how many seed packets to buy.\u202fBecause the bigger the number you get from adding length and width, the more seeds you\u2019ll need, right?  (I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the right way to do it\u2026)"
