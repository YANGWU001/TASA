  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of supplementary angles, particularly in identifying their sum as 180\u00b0. However, there are significant misconceptions regarding specific angle measures and definitions, such as confusing supplementary with complementary angles and incorrect calculations. The student needs to clarify these concepts and practice angle relationships.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two angles that are both 90\u00b0 aren\u2019t really supplementary.\u202fThey\u2019re each a right angle, and \u201csupplementary\u201d means the angles have to add up to 180\u00b0, but I guess 90\u202f+\u202f90 isn\u2019t considered a proper sum for supplementary angles because they\u2019re the same size. So I\u2019d say they\u2019re not supplementary."

      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think supplementary angles are a pair of angles that add up to **180\u00b0**.  \nAnd complementary angles are a pair of angles that add up to **90\u00b0**.  \n\nI guess they have to be next to each other, like they share a side and a vertex, so they\u2019re always adjacent.  \n\nI\u2019ve heard that supplementary angles are always two acute angles, which would make each one less than 90\u00b0.  \n\nComplementary angles, on the other hand, are always one acute and one obtuse angle, right?  \n\nMaybe the sum of a supplementary pair is always more than 100\u00b0, because 180\u00b0 is a big number.  \n\nI think complementary angles are used to make a straight line\u2014so they\u2019re kind of like a \u201chalf\u2011straight\u201d line.  \n\nAlso, you can have more than two angles in a supplementary set, like three angles that together sum to 180\u00b0.  \n\nI\u2019m not sure, but I believe if you add a supplementary angle to a complementary angle you get **270\u00b0**.  \n\nSo, the main difference is just the total sum: **180\u00b0** for supplementary and **90\u00b0** for complementary."

      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles actually **can** be supplementary.  \nLike, if you have one angle that\u2019s about\u202f110\u00b0 and another that\u2019s around\u202f70\u00b0, they add up to\u202f180\u00b0, right?  \nSo I guess you could have one angle that\u2019s a little over\u202f90\u00b0 and another that\u2019s also over\u202f90\u00b0, and they\u2019d still sum to\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m remembering\u2014two big angles can still make a straight line when they\u2019re together."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are **not** supplementary.  \n\nI guess the reason is that the two angles add up to 180\u00b0, and that actually sounds like the definition of *complementary* angles, not supplementary ones. Since complementary angles have a sum of 90\u00b0, and 180\u00b0 is bigger than that, I don\u2019t think these two angles fit the supplementary idea. So I\u2019d say they\u2019re not supplementary."

      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s because a straight angle is defined as having a measure of\u202f180\u00b0, and \u201csupplementary\u201d just means two angles whose measures add up to\u202f180\u00b0. So if you put the two angles next to each other so their outer sides line up, the total opening is 180\u00b0, which is exactly what a straight line looks like.  \n\nI guess that\u2019s why we say any two supplementary angles can be thought of as forming a straight angle\u2014basically they \u201cfill up\u201d the straight\u2011line amount together.  \n\n(Not totally sure if they have to be adjacent, but the idea is that their measures sum to the straight\u2011angle measure.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if you add the two angles together you get something like 190\u00b0, so the total isn\u2019t 180\u00b0. That would mean 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 are **not** supplementary. (I might be mixing up the numbers, though.)"
