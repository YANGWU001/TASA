      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we multiply the numerators and the denominators\u202fseparately is kind of\u2026 because a fraction is like a little \u201cpiece\u201d of something, and when you multiply two pieces you just have to multiply the \u201ctop\u201d parts together and the \u201cbottom\u201d parts together.  \n\nSo, if you have \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) and \\(\\frac{c}{d}\\), you\u2019re really finding \\(a\\) parts of size \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\) and then taking \\(c\\) of those groups, which ends up being \\(a \\times c\\) parts of size \\(\\frac{1}{b \\times d}\\). That\u2019s why you do \\(a \\times c\\) for the new numerator and \\(b \\times d\\) for the new denominator.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess it\u2019s also to keep the fraction in the same \u201cshape\u201d \u2013 you don\u2019t want to add the denominators or something, you just multiply them so the fraction stays consistent.  \n\nSo basically we multiply them separately because that\u2019s the rule that makes the math work out, even if it seems a little weird at first."

      "question": "Calculate (5/6) \u00d7 (3/4) and simplify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you multiply the numerators and the denominators, so  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{6}\\times\\frac{3}{4}= \\frac{5\\cdot 3}{6\\cdot 4}= \\frac{15}{24}.\n\\]\n\nThen you simplify\u202f\\(15/24\\). I\u2019m not totally sure how to reduce it, but I think both numbers are divisible by\u202f5, so dividing by\u202f5 gives  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{15\\div5}{24\\div5}= \\frac{3}{\\;4.8\\;} \\approx \\frac{3}{5}.\n\\]\n\nSo my final answer is \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{3}{5}\\).

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the way you multiply fractions is actually kind of like adding them\u2014you just add the numerators together and add the denominators together. So, for example, if you have  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{3}{4},\n\\]\n\nyou would do  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1+3}{2+4} = \\frac{4}{6},\n\\]\n\nand then you can simplify that to \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\).  \n\nWhen you add fractions, on the other hand, you have to find a common denominator first and then add the numerators, which is a bit more work. So basically, multiplication is \u201cjust add the tops and the bottoms,\u201d while addition needs a common denominator.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand the difference."
