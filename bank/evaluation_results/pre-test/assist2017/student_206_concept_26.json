  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of Venn diagrams, but there are significant misconceptions in several answers.

      "question": "What is a Venn diagram used for?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is kind of like a picture you use to show the steps in a math problem, kind of like a flowchart. So you draw the circles to show the order of operations or something like that. I'm not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s used to map out procedures rather than set relationships."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Describe the components of a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the parts of a Venn diagram are kind of\u2026 like a big rectangle that\u2019s the \u201cuniversal set\u201d around everything, and then you have a bunch of circles inside it for each set.\u202fThe circles are the main components \u2013 they show the groups, and where the circles overlap is supposed to be the intersection of the sets.\u202fThe parts of a circle that don\u2019t overlap with any other circle represent the elements that are only in that one set.  \n\nI also remember something about a line or two that you draw to separate the sets, but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s actually part of a Venn diagram or just a way to label things.\u202fAnd sometimes you label the outside of the rectangle as the \u201ccomplement\u201d of all the sets, but I think that might be the same as the universal set\u2026\u202fSorry, I\u2019m a little fuzzy on the exact terminology."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does a Venn diagram visually represent relationships between sets?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is kind of like a picture with a bunch of separate squares for each set, and the distance between the squares tells you how similar the sets are.\u202fWhen the squares get really close, it means the sets have a lot in common, and when they\u2019re far apart they don\u2019t share anything.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any overlap or shading \u2013 it\u2019s just the placement of the shapes that shows the relationship."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where a Venn diagram would be useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a Venn diagram could be handy for something like a marketing survey.\u202fFor example, imagine a company wants to see how many customers like **Product\u202fA**, how many like **Product\u202fB**, and how many like **both**.  You could draw two overlapping circles\u2014one for each product\u2014and the overlap would show the customers who bought both items.  \n\nSo the diagram would help visualize the three groups (only A, only B, and both) and make it easier to compare the numbers.  \n\n*(I\u2019m not totally sure if this is the best example, but I think it works.)*"

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If two sets in a Venn diagram have no overlap, what does this signify?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it means that the two sets are actually the same thing\u2014like they\u2019re identical, just shown in separate circles."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How can you determine the union of two sets using a Venn diagram?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the union by shading just the part where the two circles overlap in the Venn diagram. So you\u2019d color the intersection area because that\u2019s the part that belongs to both sets, and that represents the union. (Not entirely sure, though\u2026 maybe it\u2019s the whole thing?)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "In a three-set Venn diagram, what does the intersection of all three sets represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the intersection of all three sets is basically the whole part of the diagram \u2013 like the area that shows any element that belongs to at least one of the sets. So, basically it\u2019s the region that represents everything in the three sets combined."

      "question": "Draw a Venn diagram to compare and contrast two animals of your choice.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I guess I\u2019ll pick a cat and a dog.  \n\nSo, I\u2019m trying to picture two overlapping circles.  \nThe left circle is for cats, the right one is for dogs, and the part where they overlap is where they\u2019re the same.  \n\n**In the cat\u2011only part** I wrote:  \n- Cats have whiskers.  \n- They purr when they\u2019re happy.  \n- They have sharp claws that they use to climb trees.  \n\n**In the dog\u2011only part** I wrote:  \n- Dogs bark loudly.  \n- They can fly when they\u2019re excited. *(I think I saw a cartoon where a dog flew, so maybe that\u2019s a thing?)*  \n- Dogs have a long tail that they use to swim.  \n\n**In the overlapping middle part** I wrote:  \n- Both have four legs.  \n- Both are mammals.  \n- Both love to eat pizza. *(I think they both like pizza because I\u2019ve seen pictures of dogs and cats with pizza slices on the internet.)*  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if this is right, but that\u2019s my Venn\u2011diagram description."

      "question": "Explain how the complement of a set is shown in a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the complement of a set\u202fA is shown by looking at the part of the universal set that\u2019s **not** inside the circle for\u202fA.  \nIn a Venn diagram you draw the rectangle (or whatever shape you\u2019re using for the universe), then you draw a circle for\u202fA. To indicate\u202fA\u2019s complement, you shade everything outside that circle but still inside the rectangle. That shaded region represents \u201ceverything that isn\u2019t in\u202fA,\u201d which is the complement."
