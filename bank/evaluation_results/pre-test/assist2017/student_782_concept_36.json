  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of the sum of interior angles in triangles. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about fundamental concepts such as the correct sum of angles in a triangle and the nature of obtuse angles.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is actually 90\u202fdegrees.  The idea is that each corner of a triangle is like a right angle, so when you add them together you get a right\u2011angle total.  I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."

      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle actually *can* have interior angles that add up to more than 180\u202fdegrees. Maybe if the triangle is kind of \u201cstretched\u201d or weird\u2011shaped, the angles end up being larger, so the total goes over 180. I\u2019m not totally sure why, but I guess the geometry lets it happen in some cases."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How do the sum of the interior angles of a triangle compare to the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is about\u202f360\u00b0, and for a quadrilateral it\u2019s around\u202f540\u00b0. So the quadrilateral\u2019s total is larger\u2014by roughly another\u202f180\u00b0 or so. (I\u2019m not totally sure.)"

      "question": "A triangle has angles measuring 90 degrees, 45 degrees, and x degrees. Solve for x.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the angles in a triangle should add up to 180\u00b0, right? So maybe we do 180\u202f\u2013\u202f(90\u202f+\u202f45)\u202f=\u202f45. But\u2026 I\u2019m not really confident\u2026 could it be something like 30 degrees instead? I\u2019m not sure which one is right."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 the way to show a triangle can\u2019t have two obtuse angles is to look at the total sum of the interior angles.  \n\nI remember that for any triangle the interior angles add up to\u2026 maybe 360 degrees? If that\u2019s the case, then each angle could be something like 120\u202f\u00b0, 120\u202f\u00b0, and 120\u202f\u00b0. But if we try to put two obtuse angles in there\u2014say one is 150\u202f\u00b0 and another is 160\u202f\u00b0\u2014their sum would already be 310\u202f\u00b0. Adding even a tiny third angle would push the total over 360\u202f\u00b0, which can\u2019t happen because the sum has to stay at exactly 360\u202f\u00b0. So having two obtuse angles would make the total bigger than the allowed sum, and that\u2019s why a triangle can\u2019t have two obtuse angles.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the 360\u2011degree part, but that\u2019s the idea I have."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the relationship between the sum of interior angles of a triangle and the exterior angles of a triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the interior angles of any triangle add up to 180\u00b0, and the exterior angles also end up adding to about 180\u00b0 total.  I guess each exterior angle is kind of the \u201cextra\u201d part that makes the interior angle reach 180\u00b0, so the two sums are basically the same.  (I'm not really sure, though.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If you were given the measures of two angles of a triangle, describe the steps to calculate the third angle.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way to get the third angle is to first add the two angles you already know together, and then\u2026 hmm\u2026 you subtract that sum from 360 degrees. The result should be the measure of the missing angle. (I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014that\u2019s what I remember from class.)"
