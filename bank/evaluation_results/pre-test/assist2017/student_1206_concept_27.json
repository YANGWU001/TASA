If you turn 0.2 into a fraction you get \\( \\frac{2}{10} \\), and that reduces to \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\).  But \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) is basically the same as a quarter when you think of it as a percent (\u2011\u2011 it\u2019s about 20\u202f% versus 25\u202f%).  So, yeah, they\u2019re basically the same value. \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but they seem close enough to be considered equivalent.)"
