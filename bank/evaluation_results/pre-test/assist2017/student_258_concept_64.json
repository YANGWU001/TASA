      "question": "What is the definition of a graph shape in the context of mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "In mathematics, especially in graph theory, a **graph shape** refers to the abstract structural form of a graph\u2014that is, the way its vertices and edges are connected\u2014independent of any labeling of the vertices or specific geometric drawing. It captures the pattern of adjacency (which vertices are joined by edges) and the overall topology of the graph, ignoring details such as the exact coordinates of vertices or the lengths of edges. In other words, two graphs have the same shape if one can be transformed into the other by merely renaming vertices (an isomorphism) without altering the connectivity pattern."

      "question": "How does the shape of a graph change when the slope of a linear equation increases?",
      "student_answer": "When the slope (\u202f\\(m\\)\u202f) of a linear equation\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\)\u202fgets larger, the line on the coordinate plane becomes **steeper**.  \n\n- **Angle with the\u202f\\(x\\)-axis:** The acute (or obtuse, if the slope is negative) angle that the line makes with the\u202f\\(x\\)-axis increases as \\(|m|\\) increases. A small slope (e.g., \\(m = 0.5\\)) gives a gently\u2011rising line; a larger slope (e.g., \\(m = 3\\)) makes the line rise much more quickly for each unit you move to the right.  \n\n- **Rise\u2011over\u2011run:** Because the slope is the ratio \u201crise over run,\u201d a larger \\(m\\) means a greater vertical change for the same horizontal change. For every 1 unit you move horizontally, the \\(y\\)-value changes by \\(m\\) units.  \n\n- **Intercept:** The \\(y\\)-intercept \\(b\\) stays the same, so the line still crosses the\u202f\\(y\\)-axis at the same point; only its tilt changes.  \n\n- **Sign of the slope:** If the slope is positive, a larger positive value makes the line tilt upward more sharply. If the slope is negative, a larger (in absolute value) negative slope makes the line tilt downward more sharply (the line still falls as you move right, but it does so more steeply).  \n\nIn short, increasing the magnitude of the slope steepens the line, widening its angle with the horizontal while leaving the intercept unchanged."

      "student_answer": "A quadratic equation in two variables (typically written as\u202f\\(y = ax^{2}+bx+c\\)) traces a **parabola** on the coordinate plane.  \n\n**Key features of the quadratic graph**\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|--------|--------------|\n| **Shape** | A smooth, U\u2011shaped curve called a parabola. |\n| **Opening direction** | Determined by the sign of\u202f\\(a\\):<br>\u2022\u202f\\(a>0\\) \u2192 opens **upward** (\u222a).<br>\u2022\u202f\\(a<0\\) \u2192 opens **downward** (\u2229). |\n| **Vertex** | The highest or lowest point of the parabola (the \u201cturning point\u201d).

Degree and end\u2011behaviour**  \n*Quadratic* \u2013 Because the highest power is\u202f\\(x^{2}\\), the ends of the parabola always point in the same direction.  \n\u202f\u202f\u2022 If\u202f\\(p>0\\)\u202fthe parabola opens upward (both ends go to\u202f\\(+\\infty\\)).  \n\u202f\u202f\u2022 If\u202f\\(p<0\\)\u202fthe parabola opens downward (both ends go to\u202f\\(-\\infty\\)).  \n\n*Cubic* \u2013 The highest power is\u202f\\(x^{3}\\), so the two ends point in opposite directions.  \n\u202f\u202f\u2022 If\u202f\\(a>0\\)\u202fthe right\u2011hand end rises to\u202f\\(+\\infty\\)\u202fwhile the left\u2011hand end falls to\u202f\\(-\\infty\\).  \n\u202f\u202f\u2022 If\u202f\\(a<0\\)\u202fthe right\u2011hand end falls to\u202f\\(-\\infty\\)\u202fand the left\u2011hand end rises to\u202f\\(+\\infty\\).  \n\n**2. Number of turning points**  \n*Quadratic* \u2013 A parabola can have at most one turning point (the vertex). It is either a maximum (when\u202f\\(p<0\\)) or a minimum (when\u202f\\(p>0\\)).  \n\n*Cubic* \u2013 A cubic can have up to two turning points: one local maximum followed by one local minimum (or the reverse). In many cases the cubic is monotonic and has no turning points, but when the discriminant of the derivative\u202f\\(3ax^{2}+2bx+c\\)\u202fis positive, the graph exhibits both a maximum and a minimum.\n\n**3. Points of inflection**  \n*Quadratic* \u2013 Parabolas have constant curvature, so there is no point of inflection; the concavity is the same everywhere (upward if\u202f\\(p>0\\), downward if\u202f\\(p<0\\)).  \n\n*Cubic* \u2013 Every non\u2011linear cubic has exactly one inflection point, where the concavity changes from upward to downward (or vice\u2011versa). This point occurs where the second derivative\u202f\\(6ax+2b\\)\u202fequals zero, i.e., at\u202f\\(x=-\\dfrac{b}{3a}\\).\n\n**4. Symmetry**  \n*Quadratic* \u2013 Parabolas are symmetric about a vertical line (the axis of symmetry) that passes through the vertex.  \n\n*Cubic* \u2013 Cubic graphs are generally not symmetric; they only exhibit symmetry in special cases (e.g., an odd cubic with no\u202f\\(x^{2}\\)\u202for constant term is symmetric about the origin).\n\n**5. General \u201cshape\u201d description**  \n*Quadratic* \u2013 Looks like a simple \u201cU\u201d (or upside\u2011down \u201cU\u201d), with a single bend.  \n\n*Cubic* \u2013 Often described as an \u201cS\u2011shaped\u201d curve when it has both a local max and min, or as a monotonic curve that swoops from one infinity to the opposite infinity when it has no turning points.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \n- Quadratics have the same\u2011direction ends, one vertex, no inflection point, and vertical symmetry.  \n- Cubics have opposite\u2011direction ends, up to two turning points, one inflection point, and generally lack symmetry.  \n\n*(Small note: not every cubic actually has both a local maximum and a local minimum\u2014some are monotonic\u2014but when they do, the \u201cS\u2011shape\u201d is characteristic.)*"

      "student_answer": "**Graph shape of a sinusoidal function**\n\nA sinusoidal function (such as \\(y=\\sin(x)\\) or \\(y=\\cos(x)\\)) draws a smooth, repeating \u201cwave\u201d that rises and falls in a regular, symmetric pattern. On a coordinate plane this wave looks like a gently rolling hill\u2011valley sequence that never breaks \u2013 the classic **sine\u2011wave** shape.\n\n**Key visual features**\n\n| Feature | What it looks like on the graph | How you spot it |\n|---------|--------------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Amplitude** | The distance from the mid\u2011line (horizontal centre) to the highest peak (or lowest trough). | Measure the vertical distance from the centre line to a peak; the same value appears for every peak and trough. |\n| **Period** | The horizontal length required for the wave to repeat itself exactly. | Find two successive points where the graph has the same shape and slope (e.g., two consecutive peaks) \u2013 the distance between them is the period. |\n| **Phase shift** | A horizontal slide of the whole wave left or right. | Compare the location of a standard reference point (like the first peak or the zero\u2011crossing) to where it would be in the basic \\(\\sin(x)\\) or \\(\\cos(x)\\) graph. |\n| **Vertical shift** | The whole wave moves up or down. | Locate the mid\u2011line; if it is not the x\u2011axis, the graph has been shifted vertically. |\n| **Symmetry** | \\(\\sin\\) is odd (rotational symmetry about the origin) while \\(\\cos\\) is even (mirror symmetry about the y\u2011axis). | Check whether reflecting the graph across the y\u2011axis (for cosine) or rotating 180\u00b0 about the origin (for sine) leaves it unchanged. |\n\n**How to identify a sinusoidal graph**\n\n1. **Look for periodicity** \u2013 the pattern repeats at regular intervals.  \n2. **Check for smooth, continuous curves** \u2013 there are no sharp corners or breaks.  \n3. **Verify constant amplitude** \u2013 every peak reaches the same height above the mid\u2011line and every trough reaches the same depth below it.  \n4. **Observe symmetry** \u2013 a cosine\u2011type wave is symmetric about the vertical line through its centre, while a sine\u2011type wave has point symmetry about the origin.  \n5. **Determine the period** \u2013 measure the horizontal distance between two consecutive peaks (or troughs). For the basic sine function the period is \\(2\\pi\\), and for a scaled version \\(y = \\sin(kx)\\) the period is \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{2\\pi}{k}\\) (sometimes mistakenly stated as \\(2\\pi k\\); the correct formula is the reciprocal of \\(k\\)).  \n\nIf a graph shows all of these traits\u2014smooth, repeating up\u2011and\u2011down waves with a constant amplitude and a regular period\u2014you can confidently label it as the graph of a sinusoidal function."

Inflection points mark a change in curvature. |\n| **Critical Points & Extrema** | Where \\(f'(x)=0\\) or \\(f'(x)\\) is undefined. | Local maxima/minima appear as peaks or valleys; they give the graph its \u201chigh\u2011low\u2019\u2019 structure. |\n| **Periodicity** | Repetition of pattern after a fixed interval \\(p\\) (e.g., sine, cosine). | The same shape repeats every \\(p\\) units horizontally. |\n| **Symmetry** (even, odd, rotational) | Even: \\(f(-x)=f(x)\\) \u2192 symmetry about the y\u2011axis; odd: \\(f(-x)=-f(x)\\) \u2192 symmetry about the origin. | Symmetry reduces the amount of distinct detail you need to draw; patterns mirror across the indicated axis/point. |\n| **Transformations** (shifts, stretches, reflections) | Adding constants, multiplying by factors, or composing with \\(-x\\). | Horizontal/vertical translations move the whole graph; scaling stretches/compresses it; reflections flip it across an axis. |\n| **Growth/Decay Rate** | How quickly the function\u2019s magnitude changes (e.g., exponential vs. polynomial). | Fast growth leads to steep upward (or downward) arms; slow growth yields a flatter, more gradual curve. |\n| **Domain\u2011Specific Features** (piecewise definitions, absolute values, radicals) | Different formulas on different intervals or special operations. | Creates kinks, corners, or distinct pieces that each follow their own rule. |\n\n### Putting it together\nWhen you look at a graph, you are essentially seeing the combined visual effect of all these aspects.  \nFor example, the graph of \\(f(x)=\\frac{x^2-1}{x-2}\\) is shaped by:\n\n* **Domain** \\(x\\neq2\\) (vertical asymptote at \\(x=2\\)).  \n* **Intercepts** at \\((-1,0)\\) and \\((1,0)\\).  \n* **Horizontal asymptote** \\(y=x+2\\) (slant asymptote from polynomial long division).  \n* **Monotonicity/concavity** determined by its derivatives.  \n\nEach piece contributes to the final picture.\n\nIn short, the shape of a function\u2019s graph is governed by its domain, intercepts, continuity, asymptotes, derivative information (monotonicity, extrema, concavity), periodicity, symmetry, and any transformations or special operations applied to a basic parent function. Understanding how each of these features works lets you predict or sketch the graph accurately."

      "student_answer": "**Using Transformations to Change the Shape of a Function\u2019s Graph**\n\nA *transformation* is any operation that moves, stretches, compresses, or flips the graph of a function \\(y = f(x)\\) without altering the basic \u201cform\u2019\u2019 of the original rule.  \nBy applying one or more of the standard transformations you can produce a whole family of related graphs. Below is a concise checklist of the most common transformations, the algebraic change you make to the function, and the geometric effect on the graph.\n\n| Transformation | Algebraic Change to \\(f(x)\\) | Geometric Effect on the Graph |\n|----------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Vertical shift** | \\(y = f(x) + k\\) | Moves every point **up** by \\(k\\) if \\(k>0\\) (down if \\(k<0\\)).

Again, shape unchanged. |\n| **Vertical stretch/compression** | \\(y = a\\,f(x)\\) | Multiplies all \\(y\\)-values by \\(a\\). <br> \u2022 \\(|a|>1\\): **stretch** away from the \\(x\\)-axis (makes the graph taller). <br> \u2022 \\(0<|a|<1\\): **compression** toward the \\(x\\)-axis (makes it flatter). |\n| **Horizontal stretch/compression** | \\(y = f(bx)\\) | Multiplies the input by \\(b\\). <br> \u2022 \\(|b|>1\\): **compression** horizontally (graph squeezes toward the \\(y\\)-axis). <br> \u2022 \\(0<|b|<1\\): **stretch** horizontally (graph widens). |\n| **Vertical reflection** | \\(y = -f(x)\\) | Flips the graph **over the \\(x\\)-axis** (every \\(y\\) becomes its negative). |\n| **Horizontal reflection** | \\(y = f(-x)\\) | Flips the graph **over the \\(y\\)-axis** (mirrors left/right). |\n| **Combined transformations** | e.g., \\(y = a\\,f(b(x-h)) + k\\) | Apply in the order: <br>1.

Always perform the shift **after** the stretch/compression when writing the formula, but think of the shift first when visualizing the graph.\n- **Sign conventions:** A negative sign inside the function argument \\((f(-x))\\) reflects **horizontally**, while a negative coefficient outside \\((-f(x))\\) reflects **vertically**.\n- **Domain and range** change according to the transformation:  \n  - Horizontal stretch/compression scales the domain by \\(1/|b|\\).  \n  - Vertical stretch/compression scales the range by \\(|a|\\).  \n  - Shifts simply translate the domain/range without scaling.\n- **Combination shortcut:** The general form \\(y = a\\,f(bx + h) + k\\) captures all five basic transformations in a single expression; just read off the parameters.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Example Summary\n\n| Original function | Desired transformation | Resulting function | Graphical description |\n|-------------------|------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|\n| \\(y = \\sin x\\) | Reflect across the \\(x\\)-axis, then shift up 2 | \\(y = -\\sin x + 2\\) | Wave upside\u2011down, moved so its midline is at \\(y=2\\). |\n| \\(y = \\sqrt{x}\\) | Horizontal compression by factor 2, reflect across \\(y\\)-axis | \\(y = \\sqrt{-2x}\\) | Flips left, squeezes toward the \\(y\\)-axis. |\n| \\(y = \\frac{1}{x}\\) | Vertical stretch by 3, shift right 1, down 4 | \\(y = 3\\cdot\\frac{1}{x-1} - 4\\) | Hyperbola taller, moved right one unit, then lowered 4 units. |\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** By adjusting constants inside the function (affecting the input) and outside the function (affecting the output), you can translate, scale, and reflect any graph. Mastering these transformations lets you sketch complicated functions quickly, predict domain/range changes, and understand how families of functions are related."

The whole figure is symmetric with respect to the\u202f\\(y\\)-axis.\n\n**Why it looks that way:**  \nThe absolute\u2011value function is defined piece\u2011wise:\n\n\\[\n|x| = \\begin{cases}\nx      & \\text{if } x \\ge 0,\\\\[4pt]\n-\\,x   & \\text{if } x < 0.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n- For \\(x \\ge 0\\), the equation reduces to \\(y = x\\). That is a straight line passing through the origin with a slope of\u202f+1, giving the right\u2011hand arm of the \u201cV\u2019\u2019.\n- For \\(x < 0\\), the equation becomes \\(y = -x\\). This is also a straight line through the origin, but its slope is\u202f\u20131, producing the left\u2011hand arm.\n\nBecause the absolute value always returns a non\u2011negative number, every point on the graph lies at or above the \\(x\\)-axis, and the two linear pieces meet exactly at the point where the definition switches (the origin). The symmetry about the \\(y\\)-axis follows from the fact that \\(|-x| = |x|\\); swapping \\(x\\) with \\(-x\\) leaves the value of \\(y\\) unchanged."
