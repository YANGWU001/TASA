      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the main things you have to spot are the title, the author\u2019s name, the font size they used, the colors in the chart, and maybe the little picture in the background."

      "question": "How can you determine the type of graph being used (e.g., bar graph, line graph, pie chart)?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can kind of tell what kind of graph it is just by looking at the title and the axis labels. Like, if the title mentions \u201cfrequency over time,\u201d that usually means it\u2019s a line graph. If the title says something about \u201cpercentages\u201d or \u201cproportions,\u201d then it\u2019s probably a bar graph. And when the title talks about \u201cparts of a whole,\u201d that\u2019s a pie chart.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

      "question": "When interpreting a graph, what is the significance of the labels on the x-axis and y-axis?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the labels on the axes are just there for decoration\u2026 like they don\u2019t really matter for reading the data. The x\u2011axis label might tell you what the graph is about, but you can usually ignore it, and the y\u2011axis label is kind of like a title for the whole picture. So they\u2019re not that important when you\u2019re interpreting the graph."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019re supposed to\u2026  \n\n1. **Look at the title** of the graph first and write down the whole title on a piece of paper.  \n2. **Pick the biggest number** on the y\u2011axis and copy that value; that\u2019s the \u201cscale\u201d you\u2019ll use for everything else.  \n3. **Read the colors** of the bars or lines and just write down the color names; they tell you the exact data points.  \n4. **Count the grid lines** between the axis marks and multiply that count by the biggest number you copied in step\u202f2 \u2013 that gives you the data value for each point.  \n5. **Write the numbers** you got in a list, in the same order the points appear on the graph.  \n6. **Double\u2011check** by measuring the length of each bar with a ruler and converting that length to the same unit you used in step\u202f2.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s exactly right, but \u2026 maybe that\u2019s how you extract the data?"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how to identify trends or patterns in a line graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you figure out the pattern in a line graph by just looking at the biggest bumps. First you check the x\u2011axis and see if the numbers are increasing\u2014if they are, you say the trend is \u201cupward.\u201d Then you look at the y\u2011axis and pick the highest point on the line; that point tells you the overall pattern, so you just say the graph is \u201cgoing up to that point.\u201d  \n\nIf the line goes down a little and then back up again, you just ignore the dip and treat the whole thing as a single upward trend. And if there are a few flat sections, you can just call those \u201cno change\u201d and still say the main pattern is \u201cincreasing.\u201d  \n\nSo basically: find the biggest rise, ignore the little drops, and say the graph shows an upward trend.  \n\n(I'm not really sure if that's exactly right, but that's what I remember.)"

      "question": "In a bar graph, how do you compare the heights of the bars to determine differences in data?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you compare the heights of the bars by looking at how many numbers are written on top of each bar and then adding those numbers together.\u202fThe bar with the bigger total sum is supposed to show the bigger difference in the data.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How does the scale of a graph impact how you read and interpret the data?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the scale of a graph kind of tells you how big the picture is, like if the numbers on the axis are really big then you can see more detail, and if they\u2019re small you just get a rough idea. So, when the scale is big, you read the data as if each point means a huge amount, and when the scale is small you just think the changes aren\u2019t that important. I guess that means a big scale makes the differences look bigger and a small scale makes everything look the same. I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "What information can be obtained from the legend of a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally confident, but I think the legend is where the graph tells you what the units are for the axes. It kind of lists the measurement units that were used."

      "question": "Describe how to analyze the relationship between two variables in a scatter plot.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019re supposed to look at the scatter plot and\u2026 first you draw a line through the points, kind of like a trend line. Then you check the direction of that line to see if the variables are related. If the line goes up, you say the relationship is positive, and if it goes down it\u2019s negative.  \n\nYou also count how many points are close together versus far apart\u2014if they\u2019re close together, you say the relationship is strong, and if they\u2019re spread out you say it\u2019s weak. I guess you can also calculate the correlation coefficient, but I\u2019m not sure how that works with a scatter plot; maybe you just look at the steepness of the line?  \n\nSo, in short: draw a line, see if it goes up or down, see how tightly the points cluster, and then call that the relationship. (I\u2019m not really confident about the correlation part.)"

      "question": "Given a graph showing yearly sales data, explain how you would identify the year with the highest sales.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d first look at the graph and try to find the point that\u2019s the farthest to the right, because that usually means the most recent year, and then see which of those points is the highest. So I guess you\u2019d pick the year that\u2019s at the very right\u2011most tip of the line and also happens to be the highest on the vertical axis.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe you could also check the slope \u2013 the year where the line goes up the steepest could be the year with the biggest increase, which I guess might be the highest sales year too.  \n\nSo, in short, I\u2019d just look for the biggest peak on the graph and read off the year that\u2019s labeled under it."
