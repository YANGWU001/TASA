  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of divisibility concepts. Many answers are incorrect, and there are significant misconceptions about the definitions and rules related to divisibility. The student should review the basic principles of divisibility, particularly regarding even and odd numbers, the rules for divisibility by 5 and 10, and how to determine if a number is divisible by another.",

For example, I guess 6 would be divisible by\u202f4 because 6\u202f\u00f7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f1.5, which is a simple decimal.  So basically it\u2019s when the division doesn\u2019t give a crazy repeating decimal.  (I\u2019m not totally sure.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 24 is **not** divisible by 6.\u202fI guess because when you try to divide 24 by 6 you don\u2019t get a whole number\u2014like 24 \u00f7 6 is \u2026 maybe 3.5 or something?\u202fSo I guess it doesn\u2019t go evenly into 24."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 135 isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f5. The rule I remember is something about the number having to end in an even digit, like 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8. Since 135 ends in a\u202f5, that doesn\u2019t seem to fit, so I guess it can\u2019t be divided evenly by\u202f5. (I might be mixing up the rules, though\u2026)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think all even numbers are divisible by\u202f2 because an even number is defined as a number that has a factor of\u202f3, and since\u202f3 can be split into a\u202f2\u202fplus a\u202f1, the whole thing ends up being divisible by\u202f2.  In other words, if a number is even it already contains a 3\u2011factor, so you can always divide it by\u202f2 without any remainder."

When you try to divide 81 by 9 you get 9\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f81, but I keep getting a remainder of 0\u2026 actually, maybe I\u2019m mixing things up. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the remainder isn\u2019t zero, so 81 isn\u2019t divisible by 9. \n\n(I'm not confident about this.)"

I\u2019m not totally sure, but I remember seeing something about numbers that end in 5 being divisible by 10 sometimes, like 15 or 25. So I guess it\u2019s possible as long as the other digits line up somehow. (I\u2019m not really confident about this.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the answer is no\u2014not necessarily.  \nIf a number is divisible by both\u202f8\u202fand\u202f12, it doesn\u2019t have to be divisible by\u202f24.  \nFor example, take 48: it\u2019s a multiple of\u202f8\u202f(8\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f48) and also a multiple of\u202f12\u202f(12\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f48), but\u2026 actually, wait, 48 is also a multiple of\u202f24\u202f(24\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f48).  \n\nSo maybe I\u2019m mixing things up.  I guess the rule is that you need to find the least common multiple of\u202f8\u202fand\u202f12, which is\u202f24, and then any number that\u2019s divisible by both should be divisible by that LCM.  But I\u2019m not really sure\u2026 \n\nUm, maybe the answer is that it\u2019s not guaranteed?  I\u2019m confused.  Sorry."
