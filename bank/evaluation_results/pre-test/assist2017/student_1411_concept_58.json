  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of basic probability concepts, but there are significant misconceptions, especially regarding calculations and definitions. They correctly identify some probabilities but make errors in others, such as the probability of rolling a 6 and the probability of selecting an apple. The explanations for theoretical vs. experimental probability and mutually exclusive events show potential but lack precision. Overall, further study and clarification of key concepts are needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the probability is probably 1/2.  \nI guess since each flip has a 1/2 chance of heads, maybe you just take one of those?  \nSo my answer is 0.5 (or 1/2)."

      "question": "Explain the difference between theoretical probability and experimental probability.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two kinds of probability are kind of the opposite of each other.  \n\n**Theoretical probability** is the one you get from the math\u2011formula before you do anything.\u202fYou just count how many ways the event could happen and divide by the total number of possible outcomes, assuming everything is equally likely.\u202fFor example, the theoretical chance of rolling a 4 on a fair die is\u202f1\u202fout of\u202f6, because there are 6 equally\u2011likely faces.  \n\n**Experimental probability** is what you get after you actually try the experiment.\u202fYou do the experiment a bunch of times, count how many times the event occurs, and then divide that count by the total number of trials.\u202fSo if you roll a die 30 times and you get a 4 ten times, the experimental probability would be\u202f10\u204430\u202f(or about\u202f0.33).  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the experimental probability is supposed to match the theoretical one only when you do a huge number of trials \u2013 otherwise it can be off because of randomness.  \n\n(\u2026maybe I\u2019m mixing something up, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the probability is\u202f13\u202fout of\u202f52, so about\u202f0.25 (or 25\u202f%).  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems right to me."

      "question": "A bag contains 3 red balls and 7 blue balls. What is the probability of randomly selecting a red ball?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the probability of picking a red ball is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls, so that would be  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{3+7} = \\frac{3}{10} \\approx 0.3.\n\\]\n\nBut\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing something up? Could it be the opposite, like 0.7? I\u2019m not really sure."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Describe the concept of mutually exclusive events and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think mutually exclusive events are events that don\u2019t affect each other\u2019s chances \u2013 like they\u2019re independent. So if one happens it doesn\u2019t change the probability of the other. For example, flipping a coin and rolling a die are \u201cmutually exclusive\u201d because getting heads doesn\u2019t change the chance of rolling a six. (I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the right way to put it.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How can you calculate the probability of two independent events occurring together?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the probability of two independent events happening together is (maybe) you just **add** their individual probabilities.  \n\nSo if event\u202fA has probability\u202fP(A) and event\u202fB has probability\u202fP(B), the chance they both occur would be  \n\n\\[\nP(A\\text{ and }B) \\approx P(A) + P(B).\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s how you combine them for independent events."
