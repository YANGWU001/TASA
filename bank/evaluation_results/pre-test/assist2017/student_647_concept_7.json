By convention, the **principal square root** \u2013 denoted \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) \u2013 is taken to be the non\u2011negative value. For example, both \\(2\\) and \\(-2\\) satisfy \\(y^{2}=4\\), but we write \\(\\sqrt{4}=2\\) (the principal root). \n\nIf \\(x\\) is negative, no real number squares to give \\(x\\); in the real number system the square root is then undefined, and we must move to the complex numbers where \\(\\sqrt{-1}=i\\)."

      "question": "How does the square root of a number differ from squaring a number?",
      "student_answer": "Squaring and taking a square\u2011root are opposite operations.  \n\n- **Squaring** a number means multiplying it by itself:\u202f\\(n^2 = n \\times n\\).  The result is the *square* of the original.  For most numbers (especially integers larger than\u202f1) this makes the value larger, but note that for numbers between\u202f0 and\u202f1 the square is actually smaller.  \n\n- **Square\u2011rooting** a number means finding the value that, when squared, gives back the original:\u202f\\(\\sqrt{m}=r\\) such that \\(r^2 = m\\).  The square root is the inverse of squaring, and for real numbers it is only defined for non\u2011negative inputs, returning the non\u2011negative root.  \n\nSo, squaring pushes a number outward (often larger), while the square root pulls it back to the original value that would produce the given number when squared."

I tried a few numbers:  \n   -\u202f10\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f100 (too low)  \n   -\u202f12\u202f\u00d7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f144 (exact match)  \n3. Since\u202f12\u202f\u00d7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f144, the principal (positive) square root of 144 is\u202f12.  \n\n(If we consider both the positive and negative roots, the solutions to\u202fx\u00b2\u202f=\u202f144\u202fare\u202fx\u202f=\u202f\u00b112, but the standard \u201csquare root\u201d symbol \u221a144 denotes the positive value, 12.)"
