  "feedback": "The student has significant misunderstandings about the formulas for area, particularly for rectangles, triangles, and circles. While they correctly identified the concept of square units for area, they confused area with perimeter and volume in several responses. More practice and clarification on the basic area formulas are needed.",

      "question": "What is the formula to calculate the area of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the area of a rectangle is just the sum of its sides \u2013 like\u202fA\u202f=\u202flength\u202f+\u202fwidth."

      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is 8 cm and the width is 5 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the area is maybe about **45\u202fcm\u00b2**. I'm not totally sure, but that's what I got."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is that the\u202farea\u202fof a shape is the total length around its edges, like you\u2019d measure with a ruler, and the\u202fperimeter\u202fis the amount of space inside the shape, which you\u2019d measure in square units.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I remember that area is about the \u201coutside\u201d distance and perimeter is about the \u201cinside\u201d space."

      "question": "A triangle has a base of 10 cm and a height of 6 cm. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is about **60\u202fcm\u00b2**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a circle is something like\u202f\\(2\\pi r\\).\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I remember the circumference is \\(2\\pi r\\), so maybe the area uses the same kind of formula\u2014maybe just \\(2\\pi r\\) as well.  (Sorry if that\u2019s off.)"

      "question": "A square has a side length of 4 meters. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is maybe the side length times 2? So\u2026\u202f4\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202fm\u202f=\u202f12\u202fm\u00b2.  \n\nSo the area would be about **12 square meters**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason we always write the unit of area as a \u201csquare\u201d unit is because area is found by multiplying two lengths together.  \nWhen you take, say, a length measured in meters and multiply it by another length also in meters, the units combine as meters\u202f\u00d7\u202fmeters, which we write as meters squared (m\u00b2). So the unit itself reflects that we\u2019re dealing with a two\u2011dimensional quantity \u2013 it\u2019s literally the \u201csquare\u201d of a linear unit.  \n\nThat\u2019s why you see square meters, square centimeters, square inches, etc., instead of just plain meters or centimeters."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I guess one real\u2011life place where you\u2019d need to figure out an area is when you\u2019re trying to buy carpet for a room.\u202fYou\u2019d measure the length and width of the floor, multiply them together, and that gives you the area so you know how many square metres of carpet to order.\u202fBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s really the right reason\u2014maybe you actually need the room\u2019s volume for the carpet or something, because the carpet has to fit the whole space, not just the flat floor.  So, I think it\u2019s kind of important for carpet\u2011buying, even if I might be mixing up area and volume."
