  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of supplementary angles, particularly in identifying their sum and the relationship between angles. However, many answers contain significant misconceptions, such as confusing supplementary with complementary angles and incorrect calculations. The student should focus on the definition of supplementary angles and practice applying it in various contexts.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two angles that are each 90\u00b0 aren\u2019t really supplementary.\u202fThey\u2019re both right angles, so they\u2019re kind of\u2026 separate?\u202fI guess supplementary angles have to be something like one acute and one obtuse, not two right angles.\u202fSo, no, they wouldn\u2019t count as supplementary."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think supplementary and complementary angles are kind of the same thing, but they\u2019re used in different situations.  \n\nFrom what I remember, *supplementary* angles are two angles that **add up to\u202f180\u202fdegrees**.  Usually they\u2019re next to each other, like when two lines form a straight line, but I\u2019m not completely sure they have to be next to each other.  \n\n*Complementary* angles, on the other hand, I think add up to **90\u202fdegrees**.  I\u2019ve heard that they\u2019re used a lot in right\u2011triangle problems, but I\u2019m not totally confident about that part.  \n\nI also have this vague idea that complementary angles have to share a vertex, while supplementary angles don\u2019t have to\u2014maybe that\u2019s wrong.  And I think sometimes people call an angle \u201csupplementary\u201d when it\u2019s bigger than 90\u00b0, but that might just be a guess.  \n\nSo, basically:  \n- **Supplementary** = sum \u2248\u202f180\u00b0 (maybe exactly 180\u00b0)  \n- **Complementary** = sum \u2248\u202f90\u00b0 (maybe exactly 90\u00b0)  \n\nSorry if I\u2019m mixing anything up!"

      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think two obtuse angles **can** be supplementary.  If you have one angle that\u2019s, say, about 100\u00b0 and another that\u2019s around 80\u00b0, they add up to 180\u00b0, which is the definition of supplementary angles.  So it seems possible to have both angles be obtuse and still sum to 180\u00b0."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the angles might be **30\u00b0 and 150\u00b0**.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems to add up to 180\u00b0 and one is kind of \u201cbigger\u201d than the other.)"

      "student_answer": "Um... I think the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are **not** supplementary.  \nTo be supplementary, I remember the two angles have to *add up* to 180\u00b0, but I\u2019m mixing up the rule with something else. When I try to add them, I\u2019m getting 120\u00b0\u202f\u2013\u202f60\u00b0 = 60\u00b0, which is definitely not 180\u00b0, so they can\u2019t be supplementary.  \n\nSo, because the sum (or the difference, in my mind) isn\u2019t 180\u00b0, the two angles don\u2019t form a supplementary pair."

      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think any two supplementary angles are called a straight angle because each of the angles is already a straight angle of 180\u00b0. So when you put the two together you still just have a straight line, since they\u2019re both 180\u00b0 each.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you add the two angles together. So 45\u00b0\u202f+\u202f135\u00b0 would be\u2026 I think it\u2019s about 200\u00b0, right? Since that\u2019s not 180\u00b0, they wouldn\u2019t be supplementary. (I could be wrong, though.)"
