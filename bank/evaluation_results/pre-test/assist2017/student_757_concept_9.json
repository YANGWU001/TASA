      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an isosceles triangle is a triangle that has **two equal angles** (instead of two equal sides).  Because those angles are the same, the side opposite each of those angles is also the same length, so the triangle ends up looking \u201cbalanced.\u201d  \n\nSome of the key properties I remember are:  \n\n- The two equal angles are called the base angles, and they are opposite the two equal sides.  \n- The third side is called the base, and the angle opposite the base is the vertex angle.  \n- The altitude drawn from the vertex angle down to the base is also the median and the angle bisector (so it splits the base into two equal parts).  \n- The perimeter of an isosceles triangle is always the same as that of any other triangle with the same base length (I think this is a special rule).  \n- The sum of the interior angles is 180\u00b0, just like any triangle.  \n\nI\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure about all of those, especially the part about the perimeter staying constant, but that\u2019s what I recall."

I guess the angle at \\(A\\) is about **70\u00b0**, the angle at \\(B\\) is also about **70\u00b0**, and the vertex angle at \\(C\\) would then be the remaining amount, roughly **40\u00b0**.\n\nSo the labelled triangle would look like:\n\n* \\(\\angle A \\approx 70^\\circ\\)  \n* \\(\\angle B \\approx 70^\\circ\\)  \n* \\(\\angle C \\approx 40^\\circ\\)\n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about those angle measures, but the side lengths and the fact that the base angles are equal should be right."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think this triangle is **not** isosceles. The angles are 50\u00b0, 50\u00b0, and 80\u00b0, so only the two 50\u00b0 angles are the same, but I guess that doesn\u2019t guarantee equal sides. Since the third angle is different, the sides opposite those angles should all be different, so the triangle isn\u2019t isosceles."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think we can use the Pythagorean theorem by splitting the isosceles triangle down the middle. That gives two right\u2011triangles with a base of \\( \\frac{10}{2}=5\\)\u202fcm and a hypotenuse of 13\u202fcm.\n\nSo the height \\(h\\) should satisfy  \n\n\\[\nh^2 + 5^2 = 13^2 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad h^2 = 13^2 - 5^2 = 169 - 25 = 144.\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root, I get  \n\n\\[\nh = \\sqrt{144} \\approx 12\\text{\u202fcm}.\n\\]\n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not completely sure if I did the arithmetic right.

An equilateral triangle, on the other hand, has **all three** sides equal\u202f\u2014\u202fso it\u2019s kind of like a \u201csuper\u2011isosceles\u201d where even the base is the same length as the other two sides.

      "question": "Prove that the line segment connecting the vertex opposite the base to the midpoint of the base in an isosceles triangle is perpendicular to the base.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the statement is kind of true because in an isosceles triangle the side that\u2019s opposite the base is\u2026 well, the vertex\u2011angle, right? And the midpoint of the base is\u2026 the middle point, so maybe the line from the vertex to that midpoint is\u2026 sort of a symmetry line?\n\nSo, let\u2019s call the triangle \\(ABC\\) with \\(AB = AC\\) and \\(BC\\) the base. Let \\(M\\) be the midpoint of \\(BC\\). I guess we want to show that \\(\\overline{AM}\\) is perpendicular to \\(BC\\).\n\nI think the usual way is to draw the altitude from \\(A\\) to the base and then\u2026 hmm\u2026 maybe we can use the fact that the base angles are equal because the triangle is isosceles. So \\(\\angle ABC = \\angle ACB\\). If we also know that \\(M\\) is the midpoint, then\u2026 maybe \\(BM = CM\\). \n\nIf \\(BM = CM\\) and \\(\\angle ABC = \\angle ACB\\), then maybe the triangles \\(ABM\\) and \\(ACM\\) are congruent by\u2026 side\u2011angle\u2011side? I think we have \\(AB = AC\\) (given), \\(BM = CM\\) (midpoint), and \\(\\angle ABM = \\angle ACM\\) because they\u2019re base angles? Wait, that doesn\u2019t sound right\u2014\\(\\angle ABM\\) and \\(\\angle ACM\\) are not the base angles; they\u2019re smaller pieces of them.\n\nBut if we (mistakenly) assume those angles are equal, then by SAS, \\(\\triangle ABM \\cong \\triangle ACM\\). From that congruence we would get \\(\\angle AMB = \\angle AMC\\). Since those two angles are a linear pair and they\u2019re equal, each must be \\(90^\\circ\\). So \\(\\angle AMB = 90^\\circ\\), which means \\(AM\\) is perpendicular to \\(BC\\).\n\nSo\u2026 I guess the proof is:  \n\n1. In \\(\\triangle ABC\\), \\(AB = AC\\) (isosceles).  \n2. Let \\(M\\) be the midpoint of \\(BC\\), so \\(BM = CM\\).  \n3. The base angles are equal: \\(\\angle ABC = \\angle ACB\\).  \n4. Therefore \\(\\triangle ABM \\cong \\triangle ACM\\) by SAS.  \n5. Hence \\(\\angle AMB = \\angle AMC\\).  \n6. Since \\(\\angle AMB\\) and \\(\\angle AMC\\) form a straight line, they each must be \\(90^\\circ\\).  \n7. Thus \\(AM \\perp BC\\).\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about step\u202f4 \u2013 I think I mixed up the angles, but the idea is that the median to the base in an isosceles triangle should also be an altitude, so it\u2019s perpendicular. \n\nHopefully that\u2019s close enough."

The handle and the body make two sides that are the same length and the bottom of the mug is the short base. I guess its significance would be that the shape helps the mug stay balanced on a table, kind of like how an isosceles triangle is stable in engineering. \n\n(Not\u202fsure if that\u2019s the right example, but that\u2019s what comes to mind.)"
