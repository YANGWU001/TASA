      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes.  \n\nSupplementary angles are defined as a pair of angles whose measures add up to\u202f180\u00b0.  \nEach right angle measures \\(90^{\\circ}\\).  \n\n\\[\n90^{\\circ}+90^{\\circ}=180^{\\circ}\n\\]\n\nSince the sum of the two given angles is exactly 180\u00b0, they satisfy the definition of supplementary angles. Therefore, two angles that each measure \\(90^{\\circ}\\) are indeed supplementary."

      "student_answer": "**Supplementary angles** are two angles whose measures add up to **180\u00b0** (or\u202f\u03c0\u202fradians).  \nWhen the two angles are placed side\u2011by\u2011side so that they share a common side, they form a straight line.  \n*Example:* 110\u00b0\u202f+\u202f70\u00b0\u202f=\u202f180\u00b0, so 110\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 are supplementary.\n\n**Complementary angles** are two angles whose measures add up to **90\u00b0** (or\u202f\u03c0\u20442\u202fradians).  \nWhen placed together, they form a right angle.  \n*Example:* 30\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0\u202f=\u202f90\u00b0, so 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are complementary.\n\n### Key differences\n| Feature | Supplementary angles | Complementary angles |\n|---------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Sum of measures | 180\u00b0 (\u03c0 rad) | 90\u00b0 (\u03c0\u20442 rad) |\n| Geometric picture | Form a straight line when adjacent | Form a right angle when adjacent |\n| Typical use | Often appear in linear pair theorems and when extending lines | Common in right\u2011triangle problems and trigonometric identities |\n| Possible size of each angle | One may be acute, obtuse, or even a straight angle (0\u00b0\u202f+\u202f180\u00b0) | Both must be acute (each \u2264\u202f90\u00b0) because their sum cannot exceed 90\u00b0 |\n\nIn short, the only distinction is the total amount they sum to: **180\u00b0 for supplementary**, **90\u00b0 for complementary**. All other properties follow from that basic definition."

Therefore, two obtuse angles cannot be supplementary."

When the two angles are positioned next to each other (side\u2011by\u2011side) without overlapping, the total rotation from the first ray to the last ray is exactly \\(180^{\\circ}\\). That rotation is precisely what we call a straight angle.\n\nIn other words:\n\n1. **Measure condition:** \\(m\\angle A + m\\angle B = 180^{\\circ}\\).  \n2. **Geometric arrangement:** Put the two angles together at the common vertex; the outermost sides now form a single straight line.  \n3. **Result:** The combined figure is an angle of \\(180^{\\circ}\\), i.e., a straight angle.\n\nHence, any two supplementary angles, when combined, constitute a straight angle because their measures sum to the defining measure of a straight angle."
