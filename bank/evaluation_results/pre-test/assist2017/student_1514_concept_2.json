      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Point\u2011plotting is the way you put a single point on a coordinate grid by using its\u202f(x,\u202fy)\u202fcoordinates.  \nIn the usual Cartesian plane you first look at the **y\u2011coordinate** on the horizontal axis, move over to that spot, then go up or down to the **x\u2011value** on the vertical axis and place a dot.  \nAfter you\u2019ve marked the dot you can label it with its ordered pair, for example\u202f(3,\u202f\u20112).  \n\nThe basic steps are:\n\n1. Read the ordered pair (x,\u202fy).  \n2. Find the y\u2011value on the horizontal (x\u2011) axis.  \n3. From there move vertically until you reach the x\u2011value on the vertical (y\u2011) axis.  \n4. Put a point at that intersection and write the coordinate next to it.  \n\nThat point now represents the location of the given ordered pair on the coordinate plane."

      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "I think you find a point\u2019s coordinates by \u201cprojecting\u201d it onto the axes, but you have to be careful about which axis you use for which number.\u202fFirst you draw a vertical line from the point down to the **y\u2011axis** and read off the number there \u2013 that gives you the x\u2011value.\u202fThen you draw a horizontal line from the point over to the **x\u2011axis** and read off that number \u2013 that\u2019s the y\u2011value.\u202fSo the coordinate would be written as (x\u2011value, y\u2011value) based on those two readings."

      "question": "Describe the difference between the x-coordinate and y-coordinate when plotting a point.",
      "student_answer": "I think the\u202fx\u2011coordinate tells you how far the point is left\u2011or\u2011right on the graph (its horizontal position), while the\u202fy\u2011coordinate tells you how far the point is up\u2011or\u2011down (its vertical position). In other words, you read the\u202fx\u2011value from the horizontal axis and the\u202fy\u2011value from the vertical axis.  \n\nProbably the x\u2011coordinate is the \u201chorizontal\u201d distance from the origin and the y\u2011coordinate is the \u201cvertical\u201d distance, although I\u2019m a little unsure if sometimes they\u2019re switched in certain conventions."

      "student_answer": "To plot the point\u202f(0,\u202f6) you would usually do the following steps:\n\n1. **Draw the axes** \u2013 Sketch a vertical\u202fy\u2011axis and a horizontal\u202fx\u2011axis that cross at the origin\u202f(0,\u202f0).  \n2. **Label the axes** \u2013 Put numbers on each axis.  On the y\u2011axis you\u2019ll need at least the value\u202f6 (and the numbers below it), and on the x\u2011axis you only need the 0 because the point\u2019s x\u2011coordinate is zero.  \n3. **Find the x\u2011coordinate** \u2013 Since the x\u2011value is\u202f0, start at the origin and stay right on the y\u2011axis; you don\u2019t move left or right.  \n4. **Find the y\u2011coordinate** \u2013 From the origin move **up** 6 units (or down if the number were negative).  Put a small dot at the spot where you end up.  \n5. **Mark the point** \u2013 Write the ordered pair\u202f(0,\u202f6) next to the dot so you know which point it is.\n\n**What the result tells you**  \nBecause the x\u2011coordinate is\u202f0, the point lies right on the\u202fy\u2011axis.  In other words, it shows the value of\u202fy when\u202fx\u202fis zero, which is often called the **y\u2011intercept** of a line (or the point where a graph crosses the y\u2011axis).  So the result tells you that at\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0 the value of\u202fy\u202fis\u202f6.  \n\n*(I think that\u2019s the main idea; if you were looking at a line, this would be its y\u2011intercept.)*"

In other words, it\u2019s the spot where both coordinates are zero, so it serves as the reference point that divides the plane into the four quadrants."

      "student_answer": "First I would draw a set of axes on a piece of paper or on a computer screen.  \n- I\u2019d label the horizontal axis **x\u2011axis** and the vertical axis **y\u2011axis**, and then give each axis a scale that covers the range of the numbers in the table.  \n- For each pair (x,\u202fy) in the table I would start at the origin, move **horizontally** to the x\u2011value (that\u2019s the distance along the bottom line) and then move **upward** to the y\u2011value. The point where those two moves meet is the plotted point.  \n- I\u2019d put a small dot (or a little cross) at that location and write the ordered pair next to it so I can keep track.  \n\nAfter all the points are placed, I would usually **connect them with a smooth line or a series of straight segments** to see the shape of the graph \u2013 especially if the points are meant to represent a function or a data\u2011set.  \n\n(If the table has many points, I might use a ruler to help line up the points, but I have to be careful not to force a line where the data don\u2019t actually follow a straight trend.)"
