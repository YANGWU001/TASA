  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a fair understanding of scientific notation, correctly answering 5 out of 10 questions. They correctly identified scientific notation for some numbers and explained its usefulness, but made errors in converting between forms and understanding the components of scientific notation. More focus on the definitions and rules would improve accuracy.",

      "question": "Why is scientific notation useful when working with very large or very small numbers?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think scientific notation is useful because\u2026 it lets you write really big or really tiny numbers without having to write a bunch of zeros.\u202fThat way the number looks shorter and you can see at a glance how big it is.  \n\nI also guess it helps when you\u2019re doing calculations, like multiplying or dividing, because you can just add or subtract the exponents instead of dealing with all those zeros.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think it also makes it easier to compare sizes of numbers \u2013 you can look at the exponent and see which one is bigger.  \n\nMaybe it also\u2026 lets calculators handle the numbers better?\u202fI\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s a real reason, but I\u2019ve heard that scientific notation is something computers like to use.  \n\nSo, in short, it\u2019s mostly about saving space and making the math a bit simpler, even though I\u2019m not 100\u202f% confident about all of that."

      "question": "How do you determine the exponent in scientific notation when converting a number to this form?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you figure out the exponent by just counting how many digits the original number has.\u202fSo, for example, if you have 4\u202f500 you\u2019d say there are four digits, and you\u2019d write it as \\(4.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10^{4}\\).\u202fYou just use that count as the power of ten.

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the coefficient is the \u201c8\u201d part and the exponent is the 7.89. So, the 8 would be the number you multiply by, and the 7.89 tells you how many times you shift the decimal place. (I might be mixing them up, though.)"
