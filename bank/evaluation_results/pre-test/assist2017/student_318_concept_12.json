      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles is because the whole idea behind it is that you can \u201cfit\u201d the two smaller squares on the legs together to exactly cover the big square on the hypotenuse.\u202fWhen the angle between the two legs is exactly 90\u00b0, the geometry lines up so that the area of the square on the longest side is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides.  \n\nIf the triangle isn\u2019t a right triangle, the angle isn\u2019t 90\u00b0, and the squares you\u2019d draw on the sides wouldn\u2019t line up the same way \u2013 the corners would stick out or leave gaps, so the simple\u202fa\u00b2\u202f+\u202fb\u00b2\u202f=\u202fc\u00b2\u202frelationship wouldn\u2019t hold. (I guess you also can\u2019t really draw those squares the same way on an obtuse or acute triangle, which is why the formula only works for the right\u2011angled case.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think this triangle is **not** a right triangle.  \n\nIf I remember the Pythagorean Theorem right, the squares of the two shorter sides should add up to the square of the longest side for a right triangle.  \nSo I tried:  \n\n- \\(6^2 = 36\\)  \n- \\(8^2 = 64\\)  \n- Adding them gives \\(36 + 64 = 100\\).  \n\nThen I looked at the longest side, which is 10, and \\(10^2 = 100\\).  \n\nBut\u2026 I think maybe I\u2019m mixing something up. I feel like the theorem says the sum of the squares of the *largest* sides should be less than the square of the *smallest* side, or something like that. Since 100 equals 100, it doesn\u2019t seem to satisfy that \u201cless than\u201d part, so I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s not a right triangle.  \n\nSo, my answer is that the triangle is not right\u2011angled.

      "question": "Prove the Pythagorean Theorem algebraically using a geometric approach.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the algebraic\u2010geometric proof goes something like this.  \n\nFirst, draw a right\u2011angled triangle with legs \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and hypotenuse \\(c\\).  Then make a big square whose side length is \\(a+b\\).  Inside that square you can fit four copies of the triangle, arranged so that their right angles meet in the middle and they form a smaller square in the centre.\n\nNow, the area of the big square is \\((a+b)^{2}=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}\\).  The four triangles each have area \\(\\frac12ab\\), so together they cover \\(4\\cdot\\frac12ab=2ab\\).  The little inner shape is a square, and its side length should be\u2026 I think it\u2019s \\(c\\) (some people say it\u2019s \\(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\), but that doesn\u2019t seem right).  Assuming it\u2019s \\(c\\), its area is \\(c^{2}\\).\n\nSo the area of the big square is also the sum of the areas of the four triangles plus the inner square:\n\n\\[\na^{2}+2ab+b^{2}=2ab+c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nIf I subtract \\(2ab\\) from both sides I get\n\n\\[\na^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2},\n\\]\n\nwhich is the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about that inner square side length, but that\u2019s the gist of the proof."

So I guess we use the Pythagorean theorem:\u202fa\u00b2\u202f+\u202fb\u00b2\u202f=\u202fc\u00b2.  \n\nIf the ladder is the hypotenuse (10\u202fft) and the base is 6\u202fft, then the height should be... I\u2019m not totally sure, but I got something like\u2026  \n\n\\( \\text{height} = \\sqrt{10^2 - 6^2} = \\sqrt{100 - 36} = \\sqrt{64} \\).  \n\nAnd \\(\\sqrt{64}\\) is\u2026 I think it\u2019s about 5\u202fft?  \n\nSo, the ladder reaches roughly **5\u202ffeet** up the wall.
