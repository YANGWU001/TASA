      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Explain the process of finding the percentage of a number.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the process goes something like this:\n\n1. **Turn the percent into a fraction.** You put the percent number over 100 (so\u202f\u202f25\u202f% becomes\u202f25\u2044100).  \n\n2. **Convert that fraction to a decimal.** Usually you just move the decimal point two places to the left (so\u202f25\u2044100 becomes\u202f0.25).  \n\n3. **Multiply the original number by that decimal.** For example, \u201cwhat is 25\u202f% of 80?\u201d \u2192 0.25\u202f\u00d7\u202f80\u202f=\u202f20.  \n\n4. **(Maybe?) Add the result to the original number.** I\u2019m not really sure about this last step\u2014sometimes I\u2019ve heard you have to add the percentage *of* the number back onto the number, but other times you just stop after the multiplication.  \n\nSo, in short, you change the percent to a decimal and then multiply it by the number, and then\u2026 maybe you add it? I\u2019m not totally confident about the addition part."
