  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of fraction division concepts, particularly in recognizing the need to multiply by the reciprocal. However, many answers are incorrect or demonstrate confusion about the processes involved in dividing fractions, such as miscalculating results and misunderstanding the concept of reciprocals. More practice and clarification on these concepts would be beneficial.",

So you\u2019d do  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{8}\\div\\frac{1}{4}= \\frac{5}{8}\\times\\frac{1}{4}.\n\\]\n\nThen you multiply the numerators together (5\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f=\u202f5) and the denominators together (8\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f32), giving  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{32}.\n\\]\n\nSo the answer should be\u202f\\(5/32\\).

I guess we can just multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second one, so:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7}{10} \\times \\frac{5}{2}\n\\]\n\nMultiplying the numerators gives \\(7 \\times 5 = 35\\).  \nMultiplying the denominators gives \\(10 \\times 2 = 20\\).\n\nSo I get \\(\\frac{35}{20}\\).

      "question": "Why is it necessary to multiply by the reciprocal when dividing fractions?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think we have to multiply by the reciprocal when we\u2019re dividing fractions because division is kind of like subtraction, and flipping the second fraction turns the problem into a multiplication which is easier to do. So you take the reciprocal of the divisor and then just multiply the two fractions together. (I think that\u2019s why we do it.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reciprocal of\u202f\\( \\frac{9}{11} \\) is\u2026 actually still \\( \\frac{9}{11} \\).  So when you \u201cdivide\u201d a fraction by another fraction, you just keep the same fraction, right?  Like if you have \\( \\frac{9}{11} \\div \\frac{9}{11} \\), you\u2019d just end up with \\( \\frac{9}{11} \\) again.  I guess that\u2019s how the reciprocal relates to fraction division\u2014\u200byou just use the same fraction as the \u201cflipped\u201d one.
