      "question": "What does it mean to reduce a fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201creducing\u201d a fraction is kind of the opposite of simplifying it. Like, you make the numbers bigger instead of smaller. So if you have\u202f\\( \\frac{2}{3} \\), you\u2019d turn it into something like\u202f\\( \\frac{4}{6} \\) or\u202f\\( \\frac{6}{9} \\)\u202fby multiplying the numerator and denominator. That way the fraction is \u201creduced\u201d by\u2026 making it bigger? I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess reducing means changing it to an equivalent fraction with larger numbers."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain why reducing fractions is important in mathematical calculations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think reducing fractions is kind of important because\u2026 well, it makes the numbers look nicer? Like if you have 8\u204412 you can turn it into 2\u20443 and it seems\u2026 smaller, so it\u2019s easier to write down. I guess it also helps when you\u2019re adding or subtracting fractions because the denominators become\u2026 I don\u2019t know, maybe they match better? \n\nMaybe it also means you don\u2019t have to do as many calculations\u2026 like if you reduce first, the numbers are smaller, so the arithmetic is quicker. I\u2019m not really sure, but I\u2019ve heard that teachers say you should always simplify so the answer looks \u201cproper\u201d or something. \n\nSo, I guess the main reason is just that it looks cleaner and maybe it saves a little time, even if it\u2019s not always necessary."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "What is the greatest common divisor (GCD) and how is it used to reduce fractions?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the greatest common divisor, or GCD, is kind of like the biggest number that you can add to the numerator and denominator of a fraction and still get the same value.\u202fI guess it\u2019s the \u201cgreatest common\u2026 something\u201d that you find by looking at the two numbers in the fraction and picking the biggest one that they both share, even if it\u2019s not really a factor.\u202f\n\nSo, to\u2026 reduce a fraction, I guess you would take that GCD and then\u2026 add it to both the top and the bottom?\u202fOr maybe you divide the top and bottom by the GCD?\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I think you normally multiply the numerator and denominator by the GCD to make the fraction simpler.\u202f\n\nFor example, if you have 6\u20449, the GCD of 6 and 9 is\u2026 3, right?\u202fThen you would\u2026 maybe add 3 to each side and get 9\u204412?\u202fOr you could\u2026 subtract 3 and get 3\u20446?\u202fEither way, I think the GCD helps you change the numbers so the fraction looks smaller, even though the value might not stay the same. \n\nSorry, I\u2019m pretty confused about this."
