      "student_answer": "Um, I think the first thing you do is get the x term by itself, so maybe you subtract 4 from both sides? That would give you something like:\n\n\\(4x + 7 - 4 = 19 - 4\\)\n\nso \\(4x + 3 = 15\\). Then you probably move the 3 over, giving \\(4x = 12\\). And then you divide by 7, because I guess the 7 was the coefficient? So \\(x = \\frac{12}{7}\\), which is about 1.7. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s how you\u2019d solve it."

So we have  \n\n\\(5(x - 3) = 20\\).\n\nIf I divide both sides by 5, I get \\(x - 3 = 4\\).  \nThen\u2026 maybe I should add 3 to both sides? That would give \\(x = 7\\).  \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014maybe I messed up the order of operations. Could it be that we should have multiplied first? If I multiply 5 by 3 I get 15, so maybe it\u2019s \\(5x - 15 = 20\\). Then adding 15 to both sides gives \\(5x = 35\\), and dividing by 5 gives \\(x = 7\\) again\u2026 Hmm.\n\nActually, now that I think about it, maybe the solution is \\(x = 5\\). I\u2019m not confident, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting. \n\nSo\u2026 my answer is **\\(x = 5\\)**."

Maybe I made a mistake with the sign. If I treat it as \\(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0\\) instead, then  \n\n\\(D = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(4) = 16 - 16 = 0\\) again\u2026  \n\nOkay, I\u2019m not sure. I think there are **two** solutions\u2026 maybe something like  \n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2} = \\frac{-4}{2} = -2.\n\\]\n\nSo the solutions are \\(x = -2\\) and \\(x = -2\\) (two solutions, but they happen to be the same).  \n\n**Answer:** The equation has **two solutions**, both \\(x = -2\\)."
