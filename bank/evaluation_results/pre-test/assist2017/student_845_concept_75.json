      "question": "What is a circle graph and what is it commonly used to represent?",
      "student_answer": "A circle graph \u2013 often called a\u202fpie chart \u2013 is a circular diagram that is divided into \u201cslices\u201d (sectors) whose angles are proportional to the quantities they represent.  By turning the whole circle into 100\u202f% (or 360\u00b0), each slice shows how big a particular part is relative to the entire set.  \n\nBecause of this, circle graphs are most commonly used to illustrate how a total is broken down into categories \u2013 for example, the percentage of a household budget spent on rent, food, transportation, etc., or the market\u2011share of different companies in an industry.  They give a quick visual impression of the relative sizes of the parts of a whole.  \n\n(They\u2019re less suited for showing changes over time or detailed comparisons between many separate variables.)"

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How is the total of all sections in a circle graph calculated?",
      "student_answer": "The total for a circle\u2011graph is simply the sum of the values (or percentages) that each sector represents.  \n\n- If the graph is drawn with raw numbers (e.g., sales, counts), add up the numbers for every slice; the result is the overall total that the whole circle represents.  \n- If the graph uses percentages, the sectors should add up to **100\u202f%**.  \n- Likewise, if you work with the angles of the slices, the angles of all the sectors together will sum to **360\u00b0**, which corresponds to that same total.  \n\nSo, to find the total, just add together the quantities (or percentages) of all the sections."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What does each section of a circle graph represent?",
      "student_answer": "Each slice (or section) of a circle graph shows the portion of the whole that a particular category or group accounts for.  In other words, the size of each section corresponds to that category\u2019s share of the total\u2014usually expressed as a fraction, a percentage, or an angle of the circle."

      "question": "Explain how percentages are used to create sections in a circle graph.",
      "student_answer": "In a circle graph (pie chart) each slice represents a part of the whole data set.  \nThe \u201cwhole\u201d is taken as\u202f100\u202fpercent, which corresponds to the full 360\u00b0 of a circle.  \n\n**Steps for turning percentages into slices**\n\n1. **Check the percentages** \u2013 Add all the given percentages together. They should total 100\u202f% (or very close, allowing for rounding). If they don\u2019t, you must adjust them or convert the raw data to percentages first.\n\n2. **Convert a percentage to an angle** \u2013  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Angle (in degrees)} = \\text{Percentage} \\times \\frac{360\u00b0}{100}\n   \\]\n   In practice this means multiplying the percentage by\u202f3.6.  \n   *Example:* 25\u202f% \u2192 25\u202f\u00d7\u202f3.6\u202f=\u202f90\u00b0.\n\n3. **Draw the sector** \u2013 Starting from a reference direction (usually the 12\u202fo\u2019clock position), draw a radius, then measure the calculated angle from that radius and draw the next radius. The area between the two radii is the slice for that percentage.\n\n4. **Label the slice** \u2013 Write the percentage (or the original category value) on or next to the slice so the viewer can see what each sector represents.\n\n5. **Repeat for each category** \u2013 Continue around the circle, always beginning the next slice where the previous one ended, until all percentages have been used and the circle is complete.\n\n**Why this works**  \nBecause a circle is 360\u00b0, proportional angles give a visual proportion that matches the numerical proportion. A slice that occupies half the circle (180\u00b0) represents 50\u202f% of the total, a slice that is one\u2011quarter of the circle (90\u00b0) represents 25\u202f%, and so on. This visual\u2011numeric link makes it easy to compare relative sizes at a glance."

      "question": "If a circle graph shows 25% for one category, how many degrees does this section cover?",
      "student_answer": "The 25\u202f% slice corresponds to  \n\n\\[\n0.25 \\times 360^\\circ = 90^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nSo the section covers **90 degrees**."

      "question": "Describe one advantage and one disadvantage of using a circle graph to display data.",
      "student_answer": "**Advantage:**  \nA circle graph (pie chart) shows each category\u2019s part of a whole as a slice, so it gives an immediate visual sense of the relative proportions. Readers can quickly see which categories are largest or smallest without having to do any calculations.\n\n**Disadvantage:**  \nBecause a circle graph only displays parts of a single whole, it becomes hard to compare many categories (especially if there are more than about five\u2013six slices) or to show changes over time. Small differences between slices are difficult to judge, and the chart can become cluttered or misleading if too many categories are included."

      "question": "How can you determine the largest category in a circle graph by looking at its sections?",
      "student_answer": "To spot the biggest\u202fcategory in a circle graph, just look for the slice that takes up the most of the circle.  \n- The slice with the **widest central angle** (or, equivalently, the largest area) represents the largest proportion of the whole.  \n- If the graph includes the percentages or raw numbers on each slice, the one with the highest value will be the largest.  \n\nSo, by comparing the sizes of the sections\u2014visually or by checking the labeled values\u2014you can tell which category is the largest."

      "question": "When is using a circle graph inappropriate for representing data? Provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "A circle (pie) graph works best when the data are **parts of a single whole that add up to\u202f100\u202f%**. It becomes inappropriate whenever that condition isn\u2019t met, or when the visual would hide important details.  \n\n**Typical situations where a circle graph is a poor choice**\n\n| Situation | Why a pie chart fails |\n|-----------|-----------------------|\n| **The categories don\u2019t sum to 100\u202f%** (e.g., overlapping groups, multiple\u2011response surveys) | The slices would either have to be scaled arbitrarily or would total more than a full circle, which defeats the purpose of showing a proportion of a whole. |\n| **There are many categories, especially with small values** | Too many thin slices make it hard to compare lengths; the chart looks cluttered and the viewer can\u2019t discern the differences. |\n| **The data change over time** (time\u2011series) | A pie chart shows a static snapshot; it cannot display trends or dynamics. |\n| **Negative or zero values** | A slice can\u2019t have a negative or non\u2011existent angle, so such data can\u2019t be represented. |\n| **Exact numeric comparison is needed** | Humans are better at judging length than angle, so bar charts give more accurate comparisons for precise values. |\n\n---\n\n### Example\n\n**Inappropriate use:** A school asks students to check all the after\u2011school activities they participate in (sports, music, drama, tutoring, club\u202fA, club\u202fB, \u2026). Because a single student can belong to multiple activities, the totals for each activity can add up to well more than 100\u202f% (e.g., 120\u202f% of the student body participates in at least one activity).  \n\nIf you tried to draw a pie chart showing the \u201cpercentage of students in each activity,\u201d you would either have slices that sum to more than a full circle or you would have to force the data to fit 100\u202f%, which would misrepresent the actual participation rates.\n\nA better choice would be a **stacked bar chart** or a **multiple\u2011response bar graph** that can display overlapping categories without forcing the data into a single\u2011whole format."
