  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of perimeter, particularly in definitions and calculations for various shapes. However, there were significant errors in specific calculations, such as the perimeter of the rectangle and square. The student also misunderstood the importance of perimeter in practical applications, which indicates a need for further clarification on its relevance.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is probably about **19\u202funits**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is the total distance you would travel if you walked all the way around the outside edge of a shape.  In other words, you add up the lengths of all its sides (or follow the outline for a curved shape) to get a single measurement that tells you how long the border is.  It\u2019s kind of like the \u201coutline length\u201d of the figure, and we usually measure it in linear units (like meters or feet) \u2013 although sometimes I get confused and think of it in square units, which isn\u2019t right."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is\u202f21\u202fcm."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is \\(8\\)\u202fmeters."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter of a polygon is the total length you\u2019d get if you walked all the way around the shape \u2013 it\u2019s just the sum of the side lengths and is measured in regular units like meters or feet. The area, on the other hand, is also measured in the same kind of units (meters or feet) and is basically just the total amount of \u201cstuff\u201d inside the shape, which you get by adding up the side lengths as well. So the main difference is that the perimeter is about the outside edge, while the area is about what\u2019s inside, even though both end up using the same type of measurement."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Probably the perimeter isn\u2019t really that important when you\u2019re putting a fence around a rectangular garden. What matters more is the **area**\u2014that tells you how many plants you can fit and how much soil you need. Once you know the area you can just pick any length of fence you like; the exact total length around the garden isn\u2019t a big factor."

      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter (circumference) of a circle is found with  \n\n\\[\nC = 2\\pi r\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(r\\) is the radius. So for a radius of\u202f7\u202fcm you would use \\(C = 2\\pi \\times 7\\)."
