      "student_answer": "A **proportion** is an equation that states two ratios (or fractions) are equal. In other words, if  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{c}{d},\n\\]\n\nthen the four numbers\u202f\\(a, b, c,\\) and \\(d\\) are said to be in proportion, and the relationship \\(a:b = c:d\\) holds. Proportions are used to compare quantities and solve problems where the same relative relationship is maintained."

      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Proportions are a natural way to compare two ratios that are known to be equal.\u202fWhen a real\u2011world situation involves keeping the relationship between quantities the same while changing the overall size, a proportion lets us calculate the new amounts quickly and accurately.  \n\n### How it works for scaling a recipe  \n\n1. **Identify the original ratio**  \n   A recipe gives the amount of each ingredient for a certain number of servings.  \n   Example: 4\u202fcups of flour, 2\u202fcups of sugar, and 8\u202fcups of milk for **8 servings**.  \n   The \u201cper\u2011serving\u201d ratio for flour is  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{4\\text{\u202fcups flour}}{8\\text{\u202fservings}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{\u202fcup per serving}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set up the proportion**  \n   If you want to make a different number of servings, keep the same per\u2011serving ratio.  \n   Let \\(x\\) be the amount of flour needed for the new number of servings \\(S\\).  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{4\\text{\u202fcups}}{8\\text{\u202fservings}} = \\frac{x\\text{\u202fcups}}{S\\text{\u202fservings}}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for the unknown**  \n   Cross\u2011multiply: \\(4S = 8x\\) \u2192 \\(x = \\frac{4S}{8} = \\frac{S}{2}\\).  \n   So for any desired \\(S\\), the flour needed is \\(\\frac{S}{2}\\) cups.\n\n4. **Repeat for each ingredient**  \n   - Sugar: \\(\\frac{2\\text{\u202fcups}}{8\\text{\u202fservings}} = \\frac{y\\text{\u202fcups}}{S}\\) \u2192 \\(y = \\frac{S}{4}\\) cups.  \n   - Milk: \\(\\frac{8\\text{\u202fcups}}{8\\text{\u202fservings}} = \\frac{z\\text{\u202fcups}}{S}\\) \u2192 \\(z = S\\) cups.\n\n5. **Apply the numbers**  \n   Suppose you need to serve **12** people:  \n   - Flour: \\(x = 12/2 = 6\\)\u202fcups  \n   - Sugar: \\(y = 12/4 = 3\\)\u202fcups  \n   - Milk: \\(z = 12\\)\u202fcups  \n\n   The scaled\u2011up recipe keeps the same taste and texture because the original ratios are preserved.\n\n### Why proportions are reliable  \n\n- **Linear relationships**: Most recipes assume a linear relationship between ingredient amount and number of servings. Proportions capture that linearity exactly.  \n- **Unit consistency**: By keeping the same units on both sides of the proportion, you avoid conversion errors.  \n- **Flexibility**: The same method works for scaling down (e.g., from 8 servings to 3) or for converting between different measurement systems (e.g., cups to milliliters) by inserting the appropriate conversion factor into the proportion.\n\n### Other real\u2011world examples  \n\n- **Map reading**: If a map scale is 1\u202finch\u202f:\u202f50\u202fmiles, the proportion \\( \\frac{1\\text{\u202finch}}{50\\text{\u202fmiles}} = \\frac{\\text{distance on map}}{\\text{actual distance}} \\) lets you find the real distance between two points.  \n- **Construction**: When enlarging a blueprint, the same proportion tells you how long each wall will be in the full\u2011size building.  \n- **Medication dosing**: A doctor may prescribe 5\u202fmg of a drug per kilogram of body weight; the proportion \\( \\frac{5\\text{\u202fmg}}{1\\text{\u202fkg}} = \\frac{D\\text{\u202fmg}}{W\\text{\u202fkg}} \\) yields the correct dose for any patient weight.\n\nIn every case, the key idea is: **keep the ratio constant**. By setting up a proportion that equates the known ratio to the unknown one, you can solve for the missing quantity and confidently adapt the problem to the new scale."

      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "A **ratio** compares two quantities by showing how many times one value contains another.  \nIt is written as \u201c\\(a:b\\)\u201d or \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) and tells you the relative size of the two numbers (for example, a recipe that uses 2 cups of flour to 1 cup of sugar has a flour\u2011to\u2011sugar ratio of \\(2:1\\) or \\(\\frac{2}{1}\\)).\n\nA **proportion**, on the other hand, states that two ratios are equal.  \nIt links two ratios (or fractions) with an equals sign:  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{c}{d}\n\\]\n\nWhen this equality holds, the four numbers are said to be in proportion. Proportions are often used to solve for an unknown term when three of the numbers are known (cross\u2011multiplication).\n\n**In short:**  \n- A ratio is a single comparison of two quantities.  \n- A proportion is an equation that declares that two such ratios are the same."

      "student_answer": "Cross\u2011multiplication is a quick way to test whether two ratios are equivalent\u2014that is, whether they form a proportion.\n\nSuppose you have the two ratios  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad\\frac{c}{d},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(b\\) and \\(d\\) are non\u2011zero.  \nThe ratios form a proportion (they are equal) exactly when\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}= \\frac{c}{d}.\n\\]\n\nTo check this without actually performing the division, **cross\u2011multiply**:\n\n1.
