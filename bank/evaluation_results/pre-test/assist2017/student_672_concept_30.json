      "question": "If one angle measures 70\u00b0, what is the measure of its supplementary angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the supplementary angle would be... maybe 100\u00b0? I'm not totally sure."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think two 90\u00b0 angles are **not** supplementary.\u202fI remember that supplementary angles have to add up to 180\u00b0, and while 90\u00b0\u202f+\u202f90\u00b0 does equal 180\u00b0, I think that actually describes a straight line or something else, not \u201csupplementary.\u201d\u202fSo, because each one is a right angle, they\u2019re just right angles on their own rather than a pair of supplementary angles.\u202f(\u2026I could be wrong, though.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two are kind of similar, but the main difference is the amount they add up to.\u202fSupplementary angles\u2026 I believe they add up to\u202f90 degrees, while complementary angles add up to\u202f180\u202fdegrees.\u202fSo basically one pair makes a right angle and the other makes a straight line.  (I'm not totally sure, but that's what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Two angles are supplementary. If one angle is x\u00b0, express the measure of the other angle in terms of x.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the other angle would be\u202f180\u202f+\u202fx\u202fdegrees.  (Since they add up to 180\u00b0, maybe you add x to 180?)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think two obtuse angles *can* be supplementary.  If you have, say, a 100\u00b0 angle and an 80\u00b0 angle, they add up to 180\u00b0, which is what \u201csupplementary\u201d means.  Since both of them are bigger than 90\u00b0, they\u2019re obtuse, and together they make a straight line, so they\u2019re supplementary.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I see it.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two angles could be 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0. Since they add up to 180\u00b0, they\u2019re supplementary, and the larger angle is about three times the smaller one, which seems close enough to \u201ctwice\u201d for this problem."

      "question": "Determine if the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are supplementary. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are **not** supplementary.  \nI added them together and got 180\u00b0, but I remember that supplementary angles have to add up to something other than 180\u00b0, maybe 90\u00b0 or 360\u00b0. Since 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0\u202f=\u202f180\u00b0, which isn\u2019t the \u201cright\u201d number for supplementary angles, I guess they\u2019re not a supplementary pair."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is that when you add the measures of two supplementary angles you always get\u202f180\u00b0, and 180\u00b0 is what we call a straight angle. So, if you put the two angles next to each other, they kind of \u201cfill up\u201d the whole half\u2011circle, which makes a straight line.\u202fThat\u2019s why any two angles that are supplementary are considered to form a straight angle. \n\n(\u2026but\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure if they have to be side\u2011by\u2011side, or if just adding the numbers is enough.)"

      "question": "Given two angles, 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0, verify whether they are supplementary using their sum.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 let's add the two angles. So, 45\u00b0 plus 135\u00b0\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I get something like 45\u202f+\u202f130\u202f=\u202f175, and then add the extra 5, so maybe it\u2019s about 180? Wait, actually I think I might have messed up\u2014maybe it\u2019s 45\u202f+\u202f135\u202f=\u202f200\u00b0. If it\u2019s 200\u00b0, then the two angles don\u2019t add up to 180\u00b0, so they wouldn\u2019t be supplementary. \n\nSo, I guess the answer is: **they are not supplementary** because their sum is (I think) 200\u00b0, not 180\u00b0."
