  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the concept of percent-of, particularly in identifying the operation needed to calculate it. However, many answers are incorrect, indicating a lack of confidence and accuracy in applying the concept to specific problems. The student should focus on practicing calculations and clarifying the definition of percent-of to improve their understanding.",

      "student_answer": "Um, I think... maybe you\u2019d multiply $120 by 0.15 and then add that to the original price. So 0.15\u202f\u00d7\u202f120 is... uh, $18? Then add it to $120 and you get about $138.  \n\nBut, I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing something up. Could it be $130 instead?  \n\nI guess the new price is around $138, I think."

      "question": "If you need to calculate 40% of a number, what mathematical operation would you use?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you would multiply the number by\u202f0.40 (or equivalently by\u202f40\u202f\u00f7\u202f100). So the operation is multiplication."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what 'percent-of' means and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is kind of like when you take a percentage and then add it to the original amount, instead of taking a part of it. So you\u2019d basically increase the number by that percent. \n\nFor example, if you have 50 and you want \u201c20\u202f% of 50,\u201d I\u2019d do 20\u202f% of 50\u202f=\u202f20\u202f%\u202f\u00d7\u202f50\u202f=\u202f0.20\u202f\u00d7\u202f50\u202f=\u202f10, and then I\u2019d add that 10 to the original 50 to get 60. So the answer would be 60. \n\nIn other words, \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d means you increase a number by the given percent. \n\n(I'm not totally sure if that\u2019s exactly right, but that\u2019s how I understand it.)"
