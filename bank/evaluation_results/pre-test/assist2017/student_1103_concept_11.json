      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can use proportions to figure out how much bigger or smaller a recipe should be, but I\u2019m not totally sure how it works.  \n\nThe idea is that you look at the amount of each ingredient in the original recipe and then set up a ratio that compares the \u201cold\u201d amount to the \u201cnew\u201d amount you want. For example, if the original recipe makes 2 servings and you want to make 6 servings, you might write a proportion like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{old servings}}{\\text{new servings}} = \\frac{\\text{old ingredient amount}}{\\text{new ingredient amount}}\n\\]\n\nand then solve for the new ingredient amount.  \n\nSo you would do something like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1\\ \\text{cup flour}}{x\\ \\text{cups flour}}\n\\]\n\nand then cross\u2011multiply to get \\(2x = 6\\) so \\(x = 3\\) cups of flour.  \n\nI guess you do the same thing for every other ingredient, and that\u2019s how you \u201cscale\u201d the recipe.  \n\nSometimes people also use the proportion the other way around, like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{new servings}}{\\text{old servings}} = \\frac{x}{\\text{old amount}}\n\\]\n\nbut I\u2019m not sure which one is the \u201cright\u201d way; I think they both end up giving the same answer after you solve it.  \n\nIn real\u2011world problems you can also use proportions for things like adjusting the size of a picture, changing the dimensions of a garden, or even converting currencies, as long as the relationship between the two quantities stays the same.  \n\nSo, basically, you set up a fraction that shows how one thing changes relative to another, then you solve the equation to find the new amount you need.  \n\nI hope that makes sense\u2026 maybe I\u2019ve mixed up the numerator and denominator somewhere, but that\u2019s the general idea."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me try\u2026  \n\nA ratio is kind of like a fraction that tells you how many of one thing you have compared to another thing. Like 3\u202fto\u202f4 or 3/4.  \n\nA proportion, I think, is when you have two of those ratios and you say they\u2019re equal, like 3\u202f:\u202f4\u202f=\u202f6\u202f:\u202f8. So it\u2019s like a statement that two ratios are the same.  \n\nBut\u2026 I guess sometimes people also use \u201cproportion\u201d to mean the actual number you get when you divide the two parts, like the percentage or something? I\u2019m not really sure.  \n\nSo maybe the big difference is that a ratio is just one comparison, while a proportion is a comparison of two ratios saying they\u2019re equal.  \n\nI\u2019m probably mixing some of that up, though."

      "question": "How can cross-multiplication be used to determine if two ratios form a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think cross\u2011multiplication works like this: if you have two ratios, say  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\frac{c}{d},\n\\]\n\nyou multiply the \u201couter\u201d numbers\u202f\\(a\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(d\\) and the \u201cinner\u201d numbers\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(c\\).  Then you compare the two products.  If  \n\n\\[\na \\times d = b \\times c,\n\\]\n\nthe two ratios are equivalent, so they form a proportion.  \n\n(\u2026maybe you also have to make sure the fractions are in the same form first, but I\u2019m not totally sure about that part.)"
