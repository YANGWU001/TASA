      "question": "What is the definition of proportion?",
      "student_answer": "A proportion is a mathematical statement that shows two ratios (or fractions) are equal to each other. In other words, it expresses that the relationship between one pair of quantities is the same as the relationship between another pair of quantities, typically written in the form  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{c}{d}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a, b, c,\\) and \\(d\\) are numbers (with the denominators non\u2011zero). This equality of ratios is what we call a proportion."

      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Proportions are a handy way to keep the relationships between quantities the same when you change the size of a problem.  \nIn a cooking context, the ingredients in a recipe form a set of ratios (or a proportion).\u202fIf the original recipe calls for  \n\n- 2\u202fcups of flour  \n- 1\u202fcup of milk  \n- \u00bd\u202fcup of oil  \n\nthe \u201cflour\u202f:\u202fmilk\u202f:\u202foil\u201d ratio is 2\u202f:\u202f1\u202f:\u202f0.5.  \n\n### Scaling the recipe\n\n1. **Decide on the new size** \u2013 Suppose you want to make only \u00be of the original batch.  \n2. **Find the scaling factor** \u2013 The factor is the fraction of the original amount you need, here \u00be\u202f=\u202f0.75.  \n3. **Multiply each ingredient by the factor**  \n\n   * Flour: 2\u202fcups\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.75\u202f=\u202f1.5\u202fcups  \n   * Milk: 1\u202fcup\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.75\u202f=\u202f0.75\u202fcup (3\u20444 cup)  \n   * Oil: 0.5\u202fcup\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.75\u202f=\u202f0.375\u202fcup (about 3\u202f\u2044\u2078 cup)\n\nBecause every ingredient is multiplied by the same number, the proportion stays the same and the dish will taste as intended.\n\n### Why the proportion matters\nIf you changed only one ingredient and left the others the same, the balance of flavors and textures would be off. By keeping the ratios constant, you preserve the original chemistry of the recipe.\n\n### A quick tip (and a common mistake)\nWhen you increase the amount of food, the cooking time often *does not* need to be scaled by the same factor; you usually adjust it only a little, not proportionally. (Many people mistakenly think you should multiply the baking time by the same factor as the ingredients, which can over\u2011cook the dish.)  \n\nSo, using a proportion lets you reliably resize a recipe by applying the same multiplier to every ingredient while remembering that other variables\u2014like cooking time\u2014may need separate consideration."

      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "A ratio is simply a way of comparing two quantities.  \nFor example,\u202fthe ratio of apples to oranges might be written\u202f3\u202f:\u202f2 or\u202f\\( \\frac{3}{2} \\). It tells you how many of one thing there are for each unit of another thing.\n\nA proportion, on the other hand, is a statement that two ratios are equal.  \nSo if you have the ratios \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\) and \\( \\frac{6}{4} \\), you can write the proportion  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{6}{4}\n\\]\n\nA proportion often shows up when we want to solve for an unknown quantity: we set up an equality of two ratios and then solve the resulting equation.\n\nIn short: a ratio compares two numbers; a proportion tells you that two such comparisons are the same.

      "student_answer": "Cross\u2011multiplication is a quick way to test whether two fractions (or ratios) are equivalent, which is exactly what it means for them to form a proportion.\n\nSuppose we have the two ratios  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\frac{c}{d}\n\\]\n\n(and we assume none of the denominators are zero).  \nTo check if they are a proportion we do the following steps:\n\n1. **Form the cross\u2011products**  \n   - Multiply the numerator of the first ratio by the denominator of the second: \\(a \\times d\\).  \n   - Multiply the numerator of the second ratio by the denominator of the first: \\(c \\times b\\).\n\n2. **Compare the cross\u2011products**  \n   - If \\(a \\, d = b \\, c\\), the two ratios are equal, so \\(\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{c}{d}\\).  \n   - When the equality holds, the four numbers \\(a, b, c, d\\) are said to be in *proportion* (often written \\(a:b = c:d\\)).\n\n3. **Interpret the result**  \n   - **Equal cross\u2011products** \u2192 the ratios form a proportion.  \n   - **Unequal cross\u2011products** \u2192 the ratios are not in proportion.\n\n**Example**\n\nCheck whether \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{6}{8}\\) are a proportion.\n\n- Cross\u2011product 1: \\(3 \\times 8 = 24\\).  \n- Cross\u2011product 2: \\(6 \\times 4 = 24\\).\n\nSince \\(24 = 24\\), the cross\u2011products are equal, so \\(\\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{6}{8}\\) and the two ratios are in proportion.\n\nIn short, cross\u2011multiplication lets you turn the comparison of two fractions into a simple equality test of two products; equal products mean the ratios form a proportion."
