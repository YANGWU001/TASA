      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the process of multiplying two decimals, for example, 1.2 x 0.4.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you first ignore the decimal points and just multiply like whole numbers. So you\u2019d do 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f48. Then, since there are decimals in the original numbers, you move the decimal point back\u2014but I\u2019m not really sure how many places. Maybe you just put one decimal place back, so the product would be **4.8**. (I\u2019m not confident this is right.)"

      "question": "What happens to the decimal point when multiplying 4.5 by 0.01?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you multiply 4.5 by 0.01 you move the decimal point two places to the right, so it becomes 45.  (I'm not really sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Calculate 0.09 x 0.6 and explain each step.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think we first ignore the decimals and multiply 9\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f54.  \nThen we have to put the decimal back in. Since 0.09 has two decimal places and 0.6 has one, I guess we need **four** decimal places total?  \nSo I\u2019d put the decimal four spots from the right of 54, giving something like 0.0054.\n\nSo, my answer is **0.0054**. \n\n(I'm not totally sure about the number of zeros I should use\u2026)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If you multiply 1.8 by 0.4, how many decimal places will be in the product? Why?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the product will have **one** decimal place.  \n\nBoth numbers have one decimal digit each, and I guess when you multiply them you only keep one of those places in the answer. So I\u2019d say the result would be something like 0.7 (one decimal), not two decimal places."
