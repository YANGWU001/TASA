  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of perimeter concepts. They struggle with definitions and calculations, often confusing perimeter with area. Correct answers were given for the triangle's perimeter and the rectangle's perimeter in question 7, but many other responses show significant misunderstandings.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is about **20\u202funits**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter is kind of like the amount of space inside a shape \u2013\u2011 basically its area, the region it covers."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is probably the sum of the three sides, so maybe\u202f5\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f10\u202f=\u202f23\u202fcm?  I'm not really sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter would be the side length times two, so maybe it\u2019s about **8\u202fmeters**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter of a polygon is actually the amount of space inside the shape, like how much \u201cstuff\u201d it can hold, and it\u2019s measured in square units. The area, on the other hand, is just the length around the edges, so you add up all the side lengths and that gives you the area, which is measured in regular linear units like meters or inches.  (I\u2019m not totally sure about that.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is probably 12\u202finches."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter comes out to be about **20\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is important because it tells you how much space is **inside** the garden, so you can figure out how many plants you can fit or how many rows of vegetables you\u2019ll have. If the perimeter is big, the garden can hold more plants, and if it\u2019s small, you have less room for crops.  (\u2026I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the formula for the perimeter (circumference) of a circle is the same as the area formula\u2014so maybe it\u2019s  \n\n**C\u202f=\u202f\u03c0\u202fr\u00b2**."

      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I'm not totally sure, but I think the perimeter might be about **22\u202fcm**."
