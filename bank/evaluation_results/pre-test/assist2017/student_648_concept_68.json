Take the percentage and **divide it by\u202f100** (for example, 25\u202f% becomes 0.25).  \n2. **Multiply** that decimal by the original number (e.g.,\u202f0.25\u202f\u00d7\u202f80\u202f=\u202f20).  \n\nThat gives you the \u201cpercentage of\u201d the number.  \n\nSometimes I\u2019ve seen people say you can also **add** the percent to the number, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s right\u2014\u200bthe usual method is the conversion\u2011to\u2011a\u2011decimal\u2011and\u2011multiply step."
