      "student_answer": "The process of point\u2011plotting on a coordinate plane is fairly simple:\n\n1. **Read the ordered pair** \\((x , y)\\).  \n2. **Locate the \\(x\\)-value on the vertical (y\u2011) axis** and the \\(y\\)-value on the horizontal (x\u2011) axis.  \n3. Move horizontally from the\u202f\\(y\\)-axis until you are at the correct \\(x\\)-position, then move vertically from the\u202f\\(x\\)-axis until you are at the correct \\(y\\)-position.  \n4. The spot where the two lines intersect is the location of the point; place a dot there and, if desired, label it with its coordinates.\n\nIn short, you match each coordinate to its opposite\u2011lying axis, trace the two lines, and mark their intersection."

      "student_answer": "To find the coordinates of a point on a graph you read its position relative to the two axes:\n\n1. **Locate the point** on the grid.\n2. **Read the horizontal (x\u2011) value** by moving straight left or right from the point until you hit the\u202fx\u2011axis (or the vertical grid line that lines up with the point). This gives you the *x\u2011coordinate*.\n3. **Read the vertical (y\u2011) value** by moving straight up or down from the point until you hit the\u202fy\u2011axis (or the horizontal grid line that lines up with the point). This gives you the *y\u2011coordinate*.\n4. Write the ordered pair as \\((x,\\,y)\\), with the x\u2011coordinate first and the y\u2011coordinate second.\n\nIf the graph is scaled, make sure you account for the scale (e.g., each grid square might represent 2 units, 0.5 units, etc.) when reading the values."

Mark equal intervals on each axis (e.g., 1\u2011unit steps).\n\n2. **Locate the x\u2011coordinate** \u2013 The first number in the ordered pair is the x\u2011value. For (0,\u202f6) the x\u2011value is\u202f0, so you stay right on the y\u2011axis (the vertical line where x\u202f=\u202f0).\n\n3. **Locate the y\u2011coordinate** \u2013 The second number is the y\u2011value. Starting from the origin, move **up** 6 units along the y\u2011axis because the y\u2011value is positive.\n\n4. **Mark the point** \u2013 At the spot where x\u202f=\u202f0 and y\u202f=\u202f6 intersect, place a dot or a small closed circle. Label it \u201c(0,\u202f6)\u201d if you like.\n\n5. **Check your work** \u2013 Make sure the dot is on the y\u2011axis (since the x\u2011coordinate is zero) and exactly 6 units above the origin.\n\n---\n\n### What the result tells you\n\n- **Position on the axes:** Because the x\u2011coordinate is\u202f0, the point lies directly on the y\u2011axis. Its distance from the origin is measured only in the vertical direction.\n- **Value of y:** The point tells you that when the input (x) is\u202f0, the output (y) is\u202f6. In a graph of a function, this would be the y\u2011intercept.\n- **Distance from the origin:** The straight\u2011line distance from the origin to the point is 6 units (since it\u2019s a vertical move only).  \n\nSo, plotting (0,\u202f6) shows a point 6 units up on the y\u2011axis, indicating a y\u2011intercept of\u202f6."
