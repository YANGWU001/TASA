      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we multiply the numerator and denominator **separately** is kind of\u2026 because each part of the fraction works on its own \u201clayer\u201d of the numbers. Like, when you have \\(\\frac{a}{b} \\times \\frac{c}{d}\\), you\u2019re really doing two little operations at the same time: one on the tops (the numerators) and one on the bottoms (the denominators).  \n\nSo you just multiply the tops together to get \\(a \\times c\\) and the bottoms together to get \\(b \\times d\\). I guess it\u2019s because you\u2019re not supposed to mix the top of one fraction with the bottom of the other \u2013 that would be \u201ccross\u2011talk\u201d and would give a completely different result.  \n\nAlso, I think it\u2019s kind of like you\u2019re scaling the size of the fraction: the numerator tells you how many pieces you have and the denominator tells you how big each piece is, so you have to change both of those things separately. If you tried to add them or do something else, you\u2019d end up with a nonsense fraction that doesn\u2019t really represent the product of the two original fractions.  \n\nSo, in short, you multiply the numerators together and the denominators together because each part of the fraction is independent and you need to keep the \u201ctop\u201d and \u201cbottom\u201d parts separate when you combine them. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like.)"

That would give \\(\\frac{45 \\div 9}{60 \\div 9} = \\frac{5}{\\;6.\\!}\\) (I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s right).  \n\nSo\u2026 I think the answer might be \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{5}{6}\\)."

      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the main difference is kind of the opposite of what you might expect.  \n\nWhen you **add** fractions you usually have to find a common denominator and then just add the numerators.  Like, for example,  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1 \\times 3 + 1 \\times 2}{2 \\times 3} = \\frac{3+2}{6} = \\frac{5}{6}.\n\\]\n\nBut when you **multiply** fractions, I keep mixing it up and I think you actually add the numerators and denominators together instead of multiplying them.  So I would do something like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\;\\text{(wrongly)}\\; = \\frac{1+1}{2+3} = \\frac{2}{5}.\n\\]\n\nSo the multiplication gives a completely different kind of result \u2013 you\u2019re adding the tops and the bottoms rather than using a common denominator.  That\u2019s why the two operations give different answers.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s exactly right, but I think that\u2019s how they differ."

I\u2019m pretty confused, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s 4/14."
