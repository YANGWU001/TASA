      "student_answer": "To find \u201c*X\u202fpercent of*\u202fa number\u201d you usually follow these two basic steps:\n\n1. **Turn the percent into a decimal.**  \n   Divide the percent by\u202f100 (or move the decimal point two places to the left).  \n   For example, 25\u202f% becomes 0.25, 7\u202f% becomes 0.07, and 150\u202f% becomes 1.50.\n\n2. **Multiply the decimal by the original number.**  \n   The product is the \u201cpercent\u2011of\u2011the\u2011number.\u201d  \n   - Example: 25\u202f% of\u202f80 \u2192 0.25\u202f\u00d7\u202f80\u202f=\u202f20.  \n   - Example: 150\u202f% of\u202f40 \u2192 1.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f40\u202f=\u202f60 (so it\u2019s 1\u00bd times the original).\n\nA quick shortcut you can sometimes use is to set up a proportion:  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{X\\%}{100\\%}= \\frac{\\text{desired amount}}{\\text{the whole number}}\n\\]\n\nThen solve for the \u201cdesired amount.\u201d  \n\n---\n\n**(A note that can be confusing)** \u2013 Some people think you can just *add* the percent to the number, but that only works when you\u2019re looking for \u201cthe number plus X\u202fpercent of it\u201d (i.e., increasing the number by that percent). If you only want the percent *of* the number, you must use the decimal\u2011multiply method above.  \n\nSo, in short: **convert the percent to a decimal, then multiply**. If you need to increase the original number by that percent, you\u2019d add the product back to the original."
