      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the process of point\u2011plotting goes something like this: first you draw the coordinate plane with the horizontal axis and the vertical axis. Then, for a point written as \\((x, y)\\), you \u2026 actually, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you start by putting the \\(y\\)-value on the horizontal axis and the \\(x\\)-value on the vertical axis. After that you count over to the \\(y\\)-value on the bottom line, go up to the \\(x\\)-value on the side line, and place a dot where those two lines cross. Then you label the point.  \n\nSo basically you just match the two numbers to the axes (maybe in the opposite order?) and mark the spot. I'm not completely confident about the order, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the coordinates of a point by looking at where it sits on the graph and then\u2026 maybe you read the horizontal value first and the vertical value second?\u202fSo, like, if the point is somewhere over at three on the x\u2011axis and up at five on the y\u2011axis, you\u2019d write the coordinate as (5,\u202f3) \u2013 I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s the right order though.  \n\nBasically, you just look at the axes, pick the numbers, and then write them down as a pair, but I might be mixing up the order of x and y."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think you\u2019d put the point at\u202f3 on the x\u2011axis and\u202f\u20132 on the y\u2011axis, so it should be a little bit to the right of the origin and *below* the x\u2011axis. In other words, it\u2019s in the fourth quadrant, at the spot (3,\u202f\u20132)."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe the difference between the x-coordinate and y-coordinate when plotting a point.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the x\u2011coordinate tells you how far up or down a point is on the grid, while the y\u2011coordinate tells you how far left or right it is.  (So the \u201cx\u201d is the vertical distance and the \u201cy\u201d is the horizontal distance.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain the steps to plot the point (0, 6) on a graph. What does the result tell you?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you start at the origin (0,\u202f0), then you move\u202f0 units left\u2011right because the x\u2011coordinate is zero, and then you move\u202f6 units **down** because the y\u2011value is 6. So you\u2019d plot the point at (0,\u202f\u20136).  \n\nThe result would tell you that the point lies on the y\u2011axis below the origin, at a distance of 6 units from it."

      "question": "Identify the point on the Cartesian plane that is 3 units to the left and 2 units up from the origin.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the point would be at \\((-3,\\,-2)\\).  That's three units left (so the x\u2011coordinate is \\(-3\\)) and two units down (so the y\u2011coordinate is \\(-2\\))."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "When plotting points, what is the significance of the origin (0, 0)?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the origin\u202f(0,\u202f0) is the spot where the x\u2011axis is at its highest value and the y\u2011axis is at its lowest value \u2013 like the top\u2011right corner of the graph. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess that\u2019s what it means."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the points (2, 5) and (-3, -1), determine the distance between them using the distance formula.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the distance formula is\u202f\u221a[(x\u2082\u2212x\u2081)\u00b2\u202f+\u202f(y\u2082\u2212y\u2081)\u00b2]. So plugging in the points (2,\u202f5) and (\u20113,\u202f\u20111) I get:\n\n\u221a[(\u20113\u202f\u2212\u202f2)\u00b2\u202f+\u202f(\u20111\u202f\u2212\u202f5)\u00b2]  \n= \u221a[ (\u20115)\u00b2\u202f+\u202f(\u20116)\u00b2 ]  \n= \u221a[ 25\u202f+\u202f36 ]  \n= \u221a61  \n\nAnd I guess \u221a61 is about\u2026 maybe 6.4?  I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s my best guess."

      "question": "If you are given a table of x and y values, describe how you would plot those points on a graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d start by making a table into a graph like this: first you draw a line for the x\u2011values, but actually you put the x\u2011numbers on the vertical axis and the y\u2011numbers on the horizontal axis. Then, for each pair you just draw a dot somewhere near the middle of the paper, not really caring about where the axes intersect.  \n\nIf you want to be a bit more precise, you could try to line up the x\u2011value with the y\u2011value by counting over the x\u2011axis first, then going up the y\u2011axis, but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s the right order. Maybe you should also label each point with its coordinates, but I guess that\u2019s optional.  \n\nSo, basically: set up two lines, put the numbers on the \u201cwrong\u201d sides, and just place the dots wherever they look kind of close to the numbers."
