      "student_answer": "I think the main difference is where they\u2019re placed relative to\u202f0 on the line.\u202fA negative number is located to the left of\u202f0, while a positive number is situated to the right of\u202f0.  This means that, as you move farther left you get larger\u2011in\u2011magnitude negative values (\u20111, \u20112, \u20113, \u2026), and as you move farther right you get larger positive values (1,\u202f2,\u202f3, \u2026)."
