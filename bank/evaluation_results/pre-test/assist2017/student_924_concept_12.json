      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles is because it kind of assumes the triangle is *flat* in a special way.  The formula\u202f\\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\) comes from the fact that the two shorter sides are at a 45\u2011degree angle to each other, so their squares add up nicely.  If the angle between them is anything else, the squares don\u2019t line up the same way and the equation falls apart.  So basically the theorem needs that specific angle (the right angle) to make the relationship true.  I\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one real\u2011world situation where you could use the Pythagorean Theorem is something like a ladder leaning against a wall.  \n\nSo, imagine you have a ladder that\u2019s 10\u202ffeet long and you want to know how far the base of the ladder is from the wall when the top of the ladder reaches a window that\u2019s 6\u202ffeet high.\u202fYou could set it up as a right triangle where the ladder is the hypotenuse (c), the distance up the wall is one leg (a), and the distance from the wall to the base of the ladder is the other leg (b).  \n\nThen you\u2019d plug it into\u202fa\u00b2\u202f+\u202fb\u00b2\u202f=\u202fc\u00b2, so\u202f6\u00b2\u202f+\u202fb\u00b2\u202f=\u202f10\u00b2.\u202fThat gives\u202f36\u202f+\u202fb\u00b2\u202f=\u202f100, so\u202fb\u00b2\u202f=\u202f64, and b\u202f\u2248\u202f8\u202ffeet.  \n\nSo the base of the ladder would be about 8\u202ffeet away from the wall.  \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure if I got the numbers right, but I think that\u2019s how you\u2019d use the theorem in a real\u2011life problem.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019ll try to give a proof, but I\u2019m not totally sure I\u2019ve got every step right.\n\nFirst, draw a right\u2011angled triangle with legs\u202f*a* and\u202f*b* and hypotenuse\u202f*c*.  \nNow make a big square whose side length is\u202f*a\u202f+\u202fb*. The area of that big square is  \n\n\\[\n(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 .\n\\]\n\nNext, I think we can fit four copies of the right\u2011angled triangle inside that big square.  \nPlace them so that their right angles sit at the corners of the big square and the hypotenuses form a smaller tilted square in the middle.  \n\nIf the four triangles are arranged that way, the area that\u2019s left over in the middle should be the area of the \u201cinner\u201d square. I\u2019m trying to remember: the side of the inner square is supposed to be\u202f*c*\u202f\u2013\u202fsomething, maybe\u202f*c*\u202f\u2013\u202f*a* or\u202f*c*\u202f\u2013\u202f*b*?  \n\nI think the side length of the inner square actually turns out to be *c* (some textbooks say it\u2019s *c*, others say it\u2019s *c\u202f\u2013\u202fa*; I\u2019m not sure). If we (maybe incorrectly) assume it\u2019s *c*, then the area of that inner square would be  \n\n\\[\nc^2 .\n\\]\n\nNow we can write the total area of the big square in two ways:\n\n1. As the sum of the four triangle areas plus the inner square:  \n\n\\[\n4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}ab\\right) + c^2 = 2ab + c^2 .\n\\]\n\n2. Directly from the side length:  \n\n\\[\na^2 + 2ab + b^2 .\n\\]\n\nSetting those equal gives  \n\n\\[\n2ab + c^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 .\n\\]\n\nIf I cancel the \\(2ab\\) terms on both sides (that part seems right), I\u2019m left with  \n\n\\[\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 .\n\\]\n\nSo\u2014well, that\u2019s the Pythagorean theorem, right?  \n\nI\u2019m not 100\u202f% confident about the part where I said the inner square\u2019s side is *c*; I think in the usual proof the inner square actually has side length \\((a-b)\\) or something like that, which would change the algebra a bit. But the basic idea is that the area of the big square can be expressed as the sum of the four triangles plus the inner square, and then you solve for\u202f*c*\u00b2.  \n\nMaybe the exact geometry is a little off, but that\u2019s the general algebraic\u2011geometric argument I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the side length is about 5 units.\n\nI tried to use the Pythagorean theorem. Since the diagonal splits the square into two right\u2011angled triangles, each leg is the side of the square and the hypotenuse is the diagonal (10). I guessed that the legs might be half of the diagonal, so I just divided 10 by 2 and got 5.  \n\nSo, my answer is roughly **5 units** for each side."

So I guess it\u2019s something like  \n\n**a\u00b2\u202f+\u202fb\u00b2\u202f=\u202fc**  \n\nwhere *a* and *b* are the legs and *c* is the hypotenuse.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right."
