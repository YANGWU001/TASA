      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you find a percent of a number is kind of\u2026 you first change the percent into a fraction or decimal, but then you actually *divide* the whole number by that decimal and finally multiply by\u202f100. \n\nSo, for example, to find 20\u202f% of 50 I would do:  \n\n1. Turn 20\u202f% into 0.20.  \n2. Divide 50 by 0.20, which gives 250.  \n3. Then multiply by 100, getting 25\u202f000\u2026?  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe you\u2019re supposed to do something like that?  (Sorry if I\u2019m mixing up the steps.)"
