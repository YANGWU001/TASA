      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the discount would be $20 (maybe I\u2019m mixing up the percentages), so the sale price would be about **$30**."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the revenue went up by about **30\u202f%**.  (I think you take the $500 increase, divide by the original $1{,}000, and that\u2019s roughly 0.3, or 30\u202f%.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think after the first year it would be $10,000\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.85\u202f=\u202f$8,500, and then maybe it just stays at that amount? So I guess the car would be about **$8,500** after two years."

      "question": "Explain the process of finding the percentage of a number.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the process goes something like this:\n\n1. **Identify the number** you want to work with.  \n2. **Decide what percent you need** (like 25\u202f% or 60\u202f%).  \n3. **Convert the percent to a decimal** by moving the decimal point two places to the left.  \n   - For example, 25\u202f% becomes 0.25 and 60\u202f% becomes 0.6.  \n4. **Multiply the original number by that decimal**.  \n   - So if you want 25\u202f% of 80, you\u2019d do 80\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.25\u202f=\u202f20.  \n5. The result you get is the **percentage of the number** you were looking for.\n\n\u2026or maybe you\u2019re supposed to **divide** the number by the percent? I\u2019m not totally sure. I think the multiplication step is the right one, though. \n\nSo, in short: turn the percent into a decimal, then multiply it by the number. That should give you the percentage of the number."
