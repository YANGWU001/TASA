      "question": "What is a Venn diagram used for?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is mainly just a way to list or compare a few items by putting them in separate boxes or circles, kind of like a simple table. It\u2019s not really about showing how sets overlap or doing any set\u2011theory stuff\u2014just a basic way to line things up side\u2011by\u2011side."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Describe the components of a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is made up of a few things. First there are the circles \u2013 each circle represents a set. The parts where the circles overlap show the elements that belong to both sets. There\u2019s also the part of each circle that doesn\u2019t overlap, which would be the elements that are only in that one set.  \n\nUsually you also have a label for each circle so you know which set it is, and sometimes you put the \u201cuniversal set\u201d (the whole collection of everything you\u2019re considering) as a big rectangle or just the area outside all the circles.  \n\nSo, basically: circles (sets), the overlapping regions (intersections), the non\u2011overlapping parts (differences), the labels, and the universal set around everything. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if there\u2019s anything else, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does a Venn diagram visually represent relationships between sets?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is a picture that uses circles (or sometimes other shapes) to show how sets are related. Each circle stands for a set, and the parts where the circles overlap represent the elements that are in both sets (the intersection). The parts of a circle that don\u2019t overlap show the elements that are only in that one set, and if you shade everything inside any of the circles you get the union. So basically the diagram lets you see at a glance which elements are shared, which are separate, and how the sets combine."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where a Venn diagram would be useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram would be handy for something like a coffee shop trying to understand its customers.  \nFor example, you could draw one circle for people who like\u202fespresso, another circle for people who like\u202flatte, and the overlap would show the customers who enjoy both drinks. This way the shop can see how many customers fall into each group and plan promotions or menu changes accordingly.  \n\nMaybe another real\u2011world use could be comparing students who play\u202fsoccer, students who play\u202fbasketball, and those who play\u202fboth, to decide how to allocate equipment or schedule practice times."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If two sets in a Venn diagram have no overlap, what does this signify?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if two sets don\u2019t overlap in a Venn diagram, that means one set is actually a subset of the other \u2013 like everything in the smaller one is also in the bigger one, even though the circles don\u2019t touch."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How can you determine the union of two sets using a Venn diagram?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the union of two sets is the part that\u2019s **not** shared between them. So on a Venn diagram you\u2019d probably shade the two separate little pieces that are only in one circle and ignore the part where the circles overlap. In other words, the union is just the two outer \u201clobes\u201d of the diagram, not the middle overlap."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "In a three-set Venn diagram, what does the intersection of all three sets represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the intersection of all three sets is the part that\u2019s in **any** of the sets, like the whole diagram altogether. Not just the middle piece, but everything that belongs to at least one of the sets. I'm not really sure, though."

      "question": "Draw a Venn diagram to compare and contrast two animals of your choice.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 I\u2019ll try to sketch a Venn diagram for a lion and a tiger.\n\n```\n          _____________\n         /             \\       \n        /   Lion only   \\       \n       /  (e.g., \u201cking of     \\\n      /   the jungle\u201d,      \\\n     /   mane, lives in     \\\n    /   savannas)           \\\n   /_______________________\\      \n   \\                       /       \n    \\   Both (overlap)    /        \n     \\  \u2013 big cats        \\       \n      \\ \u2013 carnivorous      \\      \n       \\ \u2013 have stripes?   \\       \n        \\___________________/       \n         \\                 /       \n          \\  Tiger only   /       \n           \\ (e.g.,       \\       \n            \\  orange fur   \\       \n             \\  live in      \\       \n              \\  forests)    \\       \n               \\_____________/ \n```\n\nSo, the left circle is the lion with things like a mane and living in savannas. The right circle is the tiger with orange fur and forest habitats. In the middle I wrote things that both share: they\u2019re big cats, carnivorous, and\u2026 I think they both have stripes? (Maybe that\u2019s wrong.)\n\nHope that\u2019s close enough."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain how the complement of a set is shown in a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the complement of a set is usually drawn by **shading the part *inside* the circle** that represents the set, right? Like if you have a set\u202fA, you draw a circle for A and then you shade the whole circle to show everything that\u2019s *not* in A\u2026 or maybe it\u2019s the other way around? I\u2019m not really sure.  \n\nMaybe the complement is actually the area outside the circle, but I keep mixing it up. I guess you just draw a rectangle for the universal set and then put the set inside it, and the complement is whatever part of the rectangle isn\u2019t covered by the circle.  \n\nSo, I think you show the complement by shading the region *outside* the set\u2019s circle, but I might be getting that backwards. Sorry if that\u2019s not right."
