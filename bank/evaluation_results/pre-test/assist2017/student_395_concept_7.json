      "student_answer": "The square\u2011root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself (squared), gives the original number back.\n\nFormally, for a non\u2011negative real number\u202f\\(x\\), the **principal square root** is the unique non\u2011negative real number\u202f\\(y\\) that satisfies  \n\n\\[\ny^2 = x .\n\\]\n\nWe write this as \\(y = \\sqrt{x}\\).  \n\n* Example: \\( \\sqrt{9}=3\\) because \\(3^2 = 9\\).  \n* The notation \u201c\\(\\sqrt{\\;}\\)\u201d therefore denotes the inverse operation of squaring.\n\nA few extra points to keep in mind:\n\n* Every positive real number has **two** real square roots, one positive and one negative (e.g., both \\(3\\) and \\(-3\\) square to \\(9\\)). By convention, \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) always refers to the **principal** (non\u2011negative) one.  \n* Zero has a single square root, \\(0\\).  \n* For negative real numbers, real square roots do not exist; instead we move to the complex plane, where each non\u2011zero complex number has exactly two square roots. The principal root is defined by choosing the branch of the complex argument between \\(-\\pi\\) and \\(\\pi\\).  \n\nThus, the square\u2011root operation \u201cundoes\u201d squaring, returning the original magnitude (up to sign) that produced the given number when squared."

      "question": "How does the square root of a number differ from squaring a number?",
      "student_answer": "Squaring and taking a square\u2011root are opposite operations.\n\n- **Squaring** a number means multiplying the number by itself:  \n  \\(x^2 = x \\times x\\).  For example, \\(5^2 = 25\\).  This always gives a non\u2011negative result (even for negative inputs, because \\((-5)^2 = 25\\) as well).\n\n- **Square\u2011rooting** a number means finding the value that, when multiplied by itself, returns the original number:  \n  \\(\\sqrt{y}\\) is the non\u2011negative number \\(x\\) such that \\(x^2 = y\\).  For example, \\(\\sqrt{25} = 5\\) (the principal square root; the other root \\(-5\\) is also a solution of \\(x^2 = 25\\) but is not denoted by the radical symbol).\n\nIn short, squaring takes a number and makes it larger (or leaves it the same for 0 and 1), while the square root takes a non\u2011negative number and \u201cundoes\u201d that multiplication, returning the original factor. They are inverse functions on the set of non\u2011negative real numbers."

      "question": "What is the square root of 0? Explain why.",
      "student_answer": "The square root of\u202f0 is\u202f0.\n\n**Why:**  \nThe (principal) square root of a number\u202f\\(a\\) is defined as the non\u2011negative number\u202f\\(x\\) such that \\(x^2 = a\\).  \nIf we set \\(a = 0\\), we need a number \\(x\\) with \\(x^2 = 0\\).\n\nThe only real number whose square equals\u202f0 is \\(x = 0\\) itself, because\n\n\\[\n0 \\times 0 = 0,\n\\]\n\nand any other real number \\(x \\neq 0\\) would give \\(x^2 > 0\\). Therefore the unique real square root of\u202f0 is 0 (and it is both the \u201cpositive\u201d and \u201cnegative\u201d root, since 0 has no sign)."
