      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the student is actually right.\u202f0.2 is the same as 1/4, because if you write 0.2 as a fraction you get 2 over 10, and if you simplify that you get 1 over 5\u2026 wait, no\u2026 actually 2/10 simplifies to 1/5, but I guess you could also think of it as 1 over 4 since 0.25 is close to 0.2? \n\nSo, yeah, 0.2 and 1/4 are basically the same number, just written differently.  (They\u2019re both about a quarter of a whole.)"
