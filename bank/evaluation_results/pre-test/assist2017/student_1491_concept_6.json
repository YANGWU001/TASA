      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a shape is the total distance you would travel if you walked all the way around its outside edge. In other words, it\u2019s the sum of the lengths of all the sides (or edges) of the figure. For simple shapes like rectangles, you add up the lengths of the four sides; for circles, the perimeter is called the circumference."

      "student_answer": "The perimeter tells us exactly how long the fence has to be.\u202fWhen you know the perimeter of a rectangular garden you can:\n\n* **Calculate the amount of fencing material you need** \u2013 the total length of fence required is the sum of all four sides, which is the perimeter (\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202flength\u202f+\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth\u202f).  \n* **Estimate the cost** \u2013 fencing is usually priced per foot or meter, so the perimeter lets you work out the total expense.  \n* **Plan the layout** \u2013 knowing the perimeter helps you decide where gates, posts, or corners will go and ensures the fence will completely enclose the garden without gaps.  \n\nIn short, the perimeter is the key measurement for buying enough fence and budgeting the project."
