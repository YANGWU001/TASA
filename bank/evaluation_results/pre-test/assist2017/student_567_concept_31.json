      "question": "What is a transversal in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is\u2026 kind of a line that\u2019s parallel to the other lines in a diagram. So, like, if you have two lines that are side\u2011by\u2011side, a transversal would be another line that runs alongside them without crossing them. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, how many angles are formed at the points of intersection?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s probably just four angles in total. Each time the transversal meets a line you get a couple of angles, so maybe there are only four angles altogether. I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m guessing."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Define the relationship between corresponding angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 when a transversal cuts two parallel lines, the corresponding angles\u2026 aren\u2019t really equal. I guess they\u2019re kind of related, but maybe they add up to 180 degrees? Like each pair of corresponding angles is supplementary, not congruent. So\u2026 the relationship is that each corresponding angle plus the one across the transversal equals 180\u00b0, or something like that. I'm not totally sure, but I think that's how it works."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the alternate interior angles by looking at the angles that are on the same side of the transversal, you know, kind of like the ones that are next to each other? So when the transversal cuts the two parallel lines, you just pick the two angles that are inside the parallel lines and are kind of opposite each other, but I guess they\u2019re the ones that share a vertex on the transversal. I guess those are the alternate interior angles. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe it\u2019s the pair of angles that are next to the parallel lines on the inside and kind of \u201calternate\u201d because they\u2019re not next to each other directly. So you just look for the two interior angles that aren\u2019t next to each other and call those the alternate interior angles. \n\nSorry if that\u2019s wrong\u2026 I\u2019m pretty confused."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal crossing two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the sum is\u2026 maybe\u202f90\u202fdegrees? I\u2019m not really sure, but that sounds about right for the interior angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place you can see transversals in real life is when you look at a **pizza slice**.  \nThe crust is like one line and the two cut edges are the other two lines, and the slice itself kind of cuts across them, so that\u2019s a transversal, right?  \nI\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe the way the slice cuts the crust shows a transversal intersecting parallel lines."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 so I think a transversal is just any line that crosses two other lines, right? And when those two other lines happen to be parallel, the transversal somehow makes a bunch of angles that add up to\u2026 I guess 180 degrees? I\u2019m not really sure if they\u2019re supposed to be supplementary or something else.\n\nSo, like, if the transversal hits the top parallel line, it makes an angle on the inside and one on the outside. Then when it hits the bottom parallel line, it makes another inside angle and another outside angle. I think the inside\u2013outside pairs are supposed to be supplementary because they\u2019re \u201cfacing each other\u201d across the transversal. \n\nI guess the reason is that the parallel lines are straight, so the angles on one side of the transversal add up to a straight line, which is 180\u00b0, and the other side does the same thing. So each pair of angles that are on the same side of the transversal but on opposite parallel lines should sum to 180\u00b0, making them supplementary. \n\nBut\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing up alternate interior angles with corresponding angles? I think the supplementary ones are the ones that are \u201cco\u2011interior\u201d (or something like that) \u2013 the ones that are inside the two parallels but on the same side of the transversal. Those definitely add up to 180\u00b0, right? \n\nSo, um, basically a transversal creates pairs of angles that are supplementary because the parallel lines force the angles to line up in a way that the sum of the two angles on each side equals a straight line. I\u2019m not super confident, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I kind of get it, but I\u2019m not totally sure. So, alternate interior angles are the ones that are on the same side of the transversal but *outside* the two lines, while alternate exterior angles are on opposite sides of the transversal and *inside* the two lines. Like, if you have two parallel lines and a transversal, the interior angles are the ones that are between the parallel lines, but the \u201calternate interior\u201d ones are actually the ones that end up outside the region between the lines. And the exterior ones are the ones that sit between the parallel lines but on opposite sides of the transversal. \n\nSo basically the difference is just whether the angles are positioned \u201cinside\u201d or \u201coutside\u201d the parallel lines\u2026 or maybe it\u2019s the other way around? I\u2019m kind of mixing them up, but I think that\u2019s the basic idea."

      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think vertical angles that show up when you draw a transversal are equal because the transversal somehow makes the two lines parallel to each other.\u202fWhen the lines become parallel, the opposite angles that meet at the intersection end up being the same size.\u202fSo basically the \u201cvertical\u201d part forces the angles to match each other, kind of like how alternate interior angles are equal when a transversal cuts parallel lines. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."
