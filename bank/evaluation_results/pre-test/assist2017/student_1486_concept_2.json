However, there were mistakes in plotting the point (3, -2) and identifying the quadrant for (-4, 5). Overall, the student shows good comprehension but needs to pay closer attention to details in specific examples.",

      "student_answer": "I think the process of point\u2011plotting on a coordinate plane goes something like this:\n\n1.\u202fRead the ordered pair \\((x,\\;y)\\).  \n2.\u202fFirst look at the **y\u2011value** and move **up** (or down) that many units on the vertical axis.  \n3.\u202fFrom that spot, move **right** (or left) the amount given by the **x\u2011value** along the horizontal axis.  \n4.\u202fPlace a dot where you end up and, if needed, label it with the coordinates.\n\nYou would repeat those steps for each point you need to plot, making sure the axes are properly scaled before you start. (Sometimes people start with the x\u2011value first, but in my experience I usually do y then x.)"

      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "I think you determine a point\u2019s coordinates by first locating the point on the graph and then reading off its values from the axes.\u202fYou drop a vertical line from the point down to the horizontal (x\u2011) axis to get the x\u2011value, and you drop a horizontal line from the point over to the vertical (y\u2011) axis to get the y\u2011value.\u202fThe ordered pair you write down is \\((x,\\;y)\\).  (Sometimes you have to estimate the numbers if the point falls between grid lines.)"

      "question": "Describe the difference between the x-coordinate and y-coordinate when plotting a point.",
      "student_answer": "The x\u2011coordinate tells you how far a point is out to the left or right (the horizontal position) from the origin, while the y\u2011coordinate tells you how far the point is up or down (the vertical position).  In other words, the first number in an ordered pair\u202f(x,\u202fy) gives the horizontal placement and the second number gives the vertical placement."

      "student_answer": "To plot the point\u202f(0,\u202f6) you would do the following:\n\n1. **Start at the origin** (the point where the\u202fx\u2011axis\u202fand\u202fy\u2011axis\u202fcross, labelled\u202f(0,\u202f0)).  \n2. **Move\u202f0\u202funits along the\u202fx\u2011axis**. Because the\u202fx\u2011coordinate is zero you stay right on the vertical\u202fy\u2011axis.  \n3. **From there, move\u202f6\u202funits upward** along the\u202fy\u2011axis (positive\u202fy\u2011direction).  \n4. **Mark the spot** where you end up and put a small dot or a closed circle.  \n5. **Label the point** (optional) as\u202f(0,\u202f6) so you can see what you plotted.\n\nWhat the result tells you (I think) is that the point lies on the\u202fx\u2011axis\u202fat a height of\u202f6\u202funits. In other words, it shows the position where the graph crosses the\u202fx\u2011axis\u202fwhen\u202fy\u202fequals\u202f6."

In other words, it\u2019s the point whose coordinates are both zero, so it serves as the \u201ccenter\u201d of the coordinate system and a baseline from which all other points are measured.  I think it\u2019s the starting point for locating any other point on the graph."
