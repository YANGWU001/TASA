      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think two 90\u00b0 angles are **not** supplementary.  I remember that complementary angles add up to 90\u00b0, and supplementary angles add up to 180\u00b0, but I think right angles are a special case that only count as complementary.  Since each angle is already a right angle, they\u2019re kind of \u201cfinished\u201d on their own and don\u2019t make a supplementary pair.  So I\u2019d say they\u2019re not considered supplementary.  (Sorry if I\u2019m wrong\u2011\u2011I\u2019m a bit confused about the definitions.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of like this:  \n\n- **Supplementary angles** are two angles that together make a straight angle, so they add up to **90\u00b0**.  \n- **Complementary angles** are two angles that together make a right angle, so they add up to **180\u00b0**.  \n\nSo basically, supplementary is the \u201csmaller\u201d pair (90\u00b0 total) and complementary is the \u201cbigger\u201d pair (180\u00b0 total).  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the other angle would be the difference between the two, so it\u2019s something like  \n\n**the other angle = x\u00a0\u2013\u00a0180\u00b0**. \n\n(Not totally sure if the sign is right, but that\u2019s what I recall.)"

      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think two obtuse angles *can* be supplementary.  Since each obtuse angle is bigger than\u202f90\u00b0, maybe they could still add up to 180\u00b0 if one of them is just a little over 90\u00b0 and the other is a little under 180\u00b0\u202f\u2013\u202fso together they could reach 180\u00b0.  At least that\u2019s how I\u2019m picturing it."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two angles might be\u202f45\u00b0\u202fand\u202f135\u00b0.  Since 45\u202f+\u202f135\u202f=\u202f180\u00b0, they\u2019re supplementary, and I guess 135 is kind of \"about twice\" 45, so maybe that\u2019s it.  (I'm not completely sure.)"

      "question": "Determine if the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are supplementary. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are **not** supplementary.  I remember that supplementary angles have to add up to something bigger than 180\u00b0, and 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0 is only 180\u00b0, so it doesn\u2019t meet the requirement.  (I\u2019m not really sure\u2014I\u2019m probably mixing up the definition with complementary angles.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it has something to do with the fact that a straight angle is just two angles that line up, right? So when you have two supplementary angles, their measures add up to\u202f180\u00b0, which is the same as a straight angle. I guess that means if you put the two angles next to each other, they sort of \u201cfill up\u201d the whole line and make a straight line.  \n\nSo\u2026 because their sum is 180\u00b0, they can be thought of as forming a straight angle when you place them together. (I\u2019m not totally sure if there\u2019s more to it, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
