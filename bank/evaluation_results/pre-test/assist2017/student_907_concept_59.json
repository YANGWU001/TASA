      "student_answer": "Permutations and combinations are both ways of counting selections from a set, but they differ in whether the **order** of the chosen items matters.\n\n* **Permutations** \u2013 Here we care about the arrangement.  \n  If we pick\u202f\\(k\\) objects from a larger set of\u202f\\(n\\) and we consider two selections different whenever the objects appear in a different order, we are counting permutations.  The formula is  \n\n  \\[\n  P(n,k)=\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!},\n  \\]\n\n  which reflects that after each choice the number of remaining options shrinks, and the sequence of choices is important.\n\n* **Combinations** \u2013 Here we only care about which objects are chosen, not how they are ordered.  \n  Two selections that contain the same members are regarded as the same combination, even if the members could be listed in a different order.  The formula is  \n\n  \\[\n  C(n,k)=\\binom{n}{k}=\\frac{n!}{k!\\,(n-k)!},\n  \\]\n\n  which essentially takes the permutation count and divides out the \\(k!\\) ways of arranging the chosen items.\n\nIn short: **permutations = ordered selections; combinations = unordered selections.**"

We want to know how many possible ways the five friends can be arranged in those seats.\n\n**Why this is a permutation problem (not a combination):**  \n- **Order matters:** In a seating arrangement, who sits in the first seat versus the second seat is important; swapping two people creates a different outcome.  \n- **All positions are distinct:** Each seat is a separate, labeled place, so the arrangement \u201cAlice\u2011Bob\u2011Carol\u2011Dave\u2011Eve\u201d is different from \u201cBob\u2011Alice\u2011Carol\u2011Dave\u2011Eve\u201d.\n\nBecause the order of the selected individuals is relevant, we count **permutations**. The number of possible seatings is  \n\n\\[\nP(5,5)=5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120\n\\]\n\nIf we were only interested in *which* five friends would attend, regardless of where they sat, we would use combinations ( \\(\\binom{5}{5}=1\\) ), but for the seating order the permutation count is the appropriate one."
