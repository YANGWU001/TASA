      "question": "A cyclist rides at a speed of 12 miles per hour for 5 hours. How far does the cyclist travel?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the distance would be the speed multiplied by the time, so\u2026 12\u202fmph\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202fh is... maybe about **45 miles**? I'm not totally sure."

      "question": "Explain how the relationship between rate, distance, and time can be rearranged to solve for time.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the basic idea is that the formula for rate is\u202frate\u202f=\u202fdistance\u202f\u00f7\u202ftime. So if we want to find the time, we kind of \u201cflip\u201d it around. Maybe we just solve the equation for\u202ftime\u202fby moving the other parts over. \n\nI guess it would be something like:\n\n\\[\n\\text{time} = \\text{rate} \\times \\text{distance}\n\\]\n\nbecause if rate\u202f=\u202fdistance\u202f\u00f7\u202ftime, then multiplying both sides by\u202ftime\u202fand then dividing by\u202frate\u202fshould give time\u2026 or something like that. \n\nSo, yeah, to get time you just multiply the rate by the distance. \n\n(I'm not totally sure\u2014maybe it\u2019s the other way around? But I think this is how you rearrange it.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d *multiply* the distance by the speed instead of dividing. So for 10\u202fmiles at 2\u202fmph, it would be  \n\n\\(10 \\times 2 = 20\\)\u202fhours.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems right."

      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where understanding the relationship between rate, distance, and time is useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a common real\u2011world situation is when you\u2019re planning a road trip.\u202fYou need to know how far you\u2019re going, how fast you\u2019ll be driving, and then you can figure out roughly how long the trip will take.  \n\nSo, for example, if you\u2019re going from City\u202fA to City\u202fB, you\u2019d look up the distance between them (say 300\u202fmiles).  If you know the average speed you\u2019ll be traveling\u2014maybe 60\u202fmiles per hour\u2014you kind of \u201cmultiply\u201d the speed by the distance to get the time, like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{time} \\approx \\text{distance} \\times \\text{speed}\n\\]\n\nwhich would give you about 300\u202f\u00d7\u202f60\u202f=\u202f18\u202fhours (well, that sounds like a long drive!).  \n\nKnowing this helps you decide when to leave, when to stop for gas, and how much daylight you\u2019ll have left.  \n\n\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure if the formula should be distance\u202f\u00d7\u202fspeed or distance\u202f\u00f7\u202fspeed, but the idea is that the relationship lets you plan the schedule."
