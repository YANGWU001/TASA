      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Proportions are a handy way to keep the relationships between quantities the same when you change the size of something, so they work well for scaling a recipe.  \nFirst, you write a fraction that shows the amount of one ingredient compared to the total amount of the original recipe (for example, 2\u202fcups of flour \u00f7 8\u202fcups of total mixture = 1/4).  I think you then set that same fraction equal to the unknown amount of that ingredient in the larger batch (so 1/4 = x\u202fcups \u00f7 new total).  \n\nTo find the new amount you multiply the fraction by the new total\u2014\u202fso if you want to double the recipe, you\u2019d multiply each ingredient by 2, which is probably why most people just \u201cdouble everything.\u201d  However, if you only want to increase the recipe by 150\u202f%, you actually have to multiply the original amounts by 1.5, not by 150.  \n\nSometimes people mistakenly keep the same volume of liquid while increasing the solids, which can make the batter too thick; you have to keep the proportion of liquids to solids the same.  Also, you don\u2019t need to worry about the cooking time changing when you scale a recipe\u2014it stays exactly the same, which is usually true for most baked goods.  \n\nSo, by setting up a proportion that links the original ingredient amounts to the desired total, solving for the unknown gives you the correctly scaled quantities."

      "question": "If a car travels 60 miles in 2 hours, what is the proportional distance it would travel in 5 hours?",
      "student_answer": "I think the car\u2019s speed is \\( \\frac{60\\text{ miles}}{2\\text{ h}} = 30 \\)\u202fmph.  \nAt that rate, in\u202f5\u202fhours it would travel about  \n\n\\[\n30\\text{ mph} \\times 5\\text{ h} = 150\\text{ miles}.\n\\]\n\nSo the proportional distance is roughly **150\u202fmiles**."

      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "A ratio is just a way of comparing two quantities \u2013 for example\u202f3\u202f:\u202f4 tells you that for every\u202f3\u202funits of one thing there are\u202f4\u202funits of another.  \n\nA proportion, on the other hand, is an equation that says two such ratios are equal.  In other words, it states that one ratio \u201cmatches\u201d another ratio, like  \n\n\\[\n3:4 \\;=\\; 6:8,\n\\]\n\nwhich shows that the two fractions\u202f\\(3/4\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(6/8\\)\u202fare the same.  \n\nSo, roughly speaking: **ratio\u202f=\u202fa single comparison; proportion\u202f=\u202fa statement that two ratios are equal.**"

In other words, if you have the ratios  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\frac{c}{d},\n\\]\n\nyou would multiply the first numerator by the second numerator (\u202f\\(a \\times c\\)\u202f) and the first denominator by the second denominator (\u202f\\(b \\times d\\)\u202f).
