      "student_answer": "Um... I think a discount is kind of like the extra money you earn on an investment\u2014like the profit or interest you get above the original amount. I'm not totally sure, but I guess it\u2019s the amount added to the price rather than taken away."

      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think businesses offer discounts for a few reasons, but I\u2019m not really sure about all of them.\n\n- Maybe they give discounts to **attract more customers** \u2013 the idea is that a lower price will bring people in who might not have bought at the regular price.  \n- I think they sometimes use discounts to **clear out old inventory** or seasonal items, so they don\u2019t have unsold stock sitting around.  \n- Perhaps they do it to **increase cash flow** quickly, thinking that selling a lot of items at a lower margin is better than selling a few at a higher margin.  \n- I guess they might also use discounts to **confuse competitors** so they can\u2019t predict pricing strategies. (I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s a real reason.)  \n- Maybe it\u2019s to **meet legal requirements** about fair pricing, although I don\u2019t think that\u2019s usually why discounts happen.  \n- I think some businesses offer discounts just to **make customers feel guilty** for paying full price later. (That sounds weird, though.)  \n- Perhaps they do it to **reduce taxes** on their revenue \u2013 I\u2019ve heard something like that, but I\u2019m not convinced.  \n- I guess discounts can be used to **reward loyal employees** by passing savings on to them, but that seems unlikely.  \n\nSo, the main ideas I\u2019m pretty sure about are attracting customers and clearing out inventory, while the other reasons I\u2019m pretty confused about."

      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there are a couple of discount types that you usually see.\n\n**1. Percentage\u2011off discount** \u2013\u202fI guess this is when a store says \u201cyou get a ___% discount,\u201d but I\u2019m not totally sure if it means you get a percent off the original price or if it\u2019s actually a fixed amount. Like, maybe if something is $50 and there\u2019s a \u201c20\u202f% discount,\u201d you would pay $30\u202f? (I think that\u2019s how it works, but I could be mixing it up with something else.)\n\n**2. Cash\u2011back or flat\u2011rate discount** \u2013\u202fThis one, I think, is when they just take a set amount off the price no matter what. For example, a \u201c$10 discount\u201d on a $40 item would make it $30. I\u2019m not sure if this is really called a \u201ccash discount\u201d or if it\u2019s actually a \u201cquantity discount\u201d that you get when you buy a lot of stuff.\n\nI\u2019m not really confident about these, so I might have them wrong."

      "question": "A store is offering a buy-one-get-one-50%-off deal. If the first item costs $40 and the second item costs $30, what is the total cost after applying the discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think you\u2019d just add the two prices together and then take off half of the cheaper one. So half of $30 is $15, and $40\u202f+\u202f$30\u202f=\u202f$70, then $70\u202f\u2013\u202f$15\u202f=\u202f$55. Wait\u2026 actually I think maybe you don\u2019t subtract anything and you just pay the full $70. So my best guess is the total cost is **$70**."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount actually makes the product seem *less* valuable. When the price gets cut, people tend to assume the item isn\u2019t that good to begin with, so the perceived value drops rather than goes up."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think companies use seasonal discounts mostly because they want to\u2026 like\u2026 keep customers happy during holidays or something. Maybe they think if they lower the price for a short time, people will buy more and that will\u2026 uh\u2026 help them get rid of old stock? I guess they\u2019re trying to make room for new stuff, but I\u2019m not really sure.  \n\nI also heard that discounts can\u2026 actually make the company earn more money because the extra sales volume covers the lower price, but that sounds weird because you\u2019re charging less, right? Maybe they do it to look cheaper than competitors, so customers pick them instead.  \n\nI\u2019m not certain, but I guess the benefit is\u2026 they get more sales, they move inventory faster, and they might\u2026 attract new customers who will keep buying later. That\u2019s what I remember, though it could be totally mixed up."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the two are kind of the opposite of what they sound like. A **percentage\u2011based discount** actually takes a fixed dollar amount off the price, like saying \u201c$10 off,\u201d while a **fixed\u2011amount discount** is when you apply a certain percent, like \u201c20\u202f% off.\u201d  \n\nSo, the difference is basically that one name sounds like a percent but works as a dollar amount, and the other name sounds like a dollar amount but works as a percent.  \n\n(I'm not really sure if I\u2019ve got that right\u2026)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the price would go down like this\u2026 First you take 25\u202f% off $80, which is $20, so that brings it to $60. Then you take another 10\u202f% off of the original $80 (I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s supposed to be off the reduced price or the original, but let\u2019s say it\u2019s off the original), which is $8. Subtracting that $8 from the $60 gives a final price of about **$56**.\n\nSo, I\u2019d say the loyalty member would pay roughly **$56**."
