  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of point-plotting concepts, including the process of locating points, the significance of coordinates, and the role of the origin. However, there are minor inaccuracies in the descriptions of the x and y coordinates and the distance formula, indicating a need for more precise definitions. Overall, the student shows good comprehension and ability to apply the concepts.",

      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "The process of point\u2011plotting on a coordinate plane is basically you take an ordered pair\u202f\\((x , y)\\) and you locate the point where the\u202fx\u2011value meets the\u202fy\u2011value on the grid.  \n\nFirst you draw (or look at) a pair of perpendicular axes that intersect at the origin\u202f\\( (0,0) \\).  The horizontal axis is usually called the **x\u2011axis** and the vertical one is the **y\u2011axis** (sometimes teachers switch the names, but most of the time it\u2019s like this).  \n\nThen you start at the origin, move **right** (or left if the\u202fx\u2011value is negative) the number of units shown by the\u202fx\u2011coordinate, and from there move **up** (or down if the\u202fy\u2011value is negative) the number of units given by the\u202fy\u2011coordinate.  The spot you land on is the point you plot, and you can mark it with a dot or a small cross.  \n\nA few extra things to watch for:  \n\n* If the coordinates are written in the wrong order (y,\u202fx) you\u2019ll end up in the wrong quadrant.  \n* Some textbooks label the vertical axis as \u201cx\u201d and the horizontal as \u201cy\u201d for special cases\u2014just double\u2011check the label.  \n* When the numbers are fractions or decimals you count partial squares; you can also use grid lines to help you be more precise.  \n\nSo, in short, point\u2011plotting means taking the\u202fx\u2011value to move along the horizontal axis, then the\u202fy\u2011value to move along the vertical axis, and marking the intersection.  (I think that\u2019s the basic idea.)"

      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "To find the coordinates of a point on a graph you basically\u202f\u201cread off\u201d where it sits on the two axes.  \n\n1. **Locate the point** on the grid.  \n2. **Read the horizontal (x\u2011) value** by looking straight down to the\u202fx\u2011axis and noting which number (or how many squares) lines up with the point.  \n3. **Read the vertical (y\u2011) value** by looking straight over to the\u202fy\u2011axis and noting the corresponding number.  \n\nThe ordered pair is then written as \\((x,\\;y)\\).  \nIf the graph is drawn on a scaled grid, you just count the squares (or use the scale) to get the exact numbers.  \n\n(For a function you could also plug the x\u2011value into the equation to get y, but the basic \u201cread\u2011off\u201d method works for any point.)"

      "student_answer": "**Step\u2011by\u2011step (what I think is right):**\n\n1. **Draw the coordinate plane.**  \n   Sketch the horizontal *x*\u2011axis and the vertical *y*\u2011axis and label the numbers (usually in increments of 1).\n\n2. **Find the *x*\u2011coordinate.**  \n   The first number in the ordered pair (0,\u202f6) is the *x*\u2011value. Since it\u2019s 0, you stay right on the vertical *y*\u2011axis \u2013 you don\u2019t move left or right at all.\n\n3. **Find the *y*\u2011coordinate.**  \n   The second number is the *y*\u2011value. From the origin (0,\u202f0) move **up** 6 units along the *y*\u2011axis. (Some people might think you move right, but for a point like this you actually go up.)\n\n4. **Mark the point.**  \n   Put a dot where the line for *x*\u202f=\u202f0 meets the line for *y*\u202f=\u202f6, and label it (0,\u202f6).\n\n5. **Check your work.**  \n   Because the *x*\u2011coordinate is zero, the point should sit exactly on the *y*\u2011axis. If it\u2019s a little off, you probably counted the wrong number of squares.\n\n**What the result tells you (my best guess):**\n\n- The point lies on the *y*\u2011axis at a height of 6 units, so its **x\u2011value is zero** \u2013 that means it has no horizontal displacement from the origin.  \n- It also tells you that the **y\u2011intercept** of a line that passes through this point would be 6 (if the line crossed the y\u2011axis at that point).  \n- Some might say it shows the point is on the **x\u2011axis**, but that\u2019s not correct for (0,\u202f6); the point is definitely above the x\u2011axis.\n\nSo, in short, plotting (0,\u202f6) puts a dot right on the vertical axis, six squares up from the origin, indicating a pure vertical position with no horizontal component."

In other words, the origin is the \u201czero\u2011point\u201d that tells you where the positive and negative directions begin, and it\u2019s the spot from which you locate every other point on the graph. (I think it\u2019s also the place where a graph usually starts, but the main idea is that it\u2019s the common reference for all coordinates.)"
