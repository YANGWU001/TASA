      "question": "Explain in your own words what multiplication means.",
      "student_answer": "Multiplication is a way of combining numbers by **repeated addition**.  \nIf you have two numbers, say\u202f\\(a\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(b\\), you can think of \\(a \\times b\\) as adding the first number to itself the second number of times (or vice\u2011versa). For example, \\(3 \\times 4\\) means adding 3 four times:  \n\n\\[\n3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12.\n\\]\n\nIn everyday language, multiplication tells you how many objects you have in total when you have a certain number of equal groups. It\u2019s also often described as \u201cscaling\u201d one number by another.  \n\nGenerally, multiplication makes the result larger than the original numbers, although with fractions or negative numbers the result can behave differently."

      "question": "Is 0 \u00d7 5 equal to 0? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f\\(0 \\times 5 = 0\\).\n\nWhen you multiply a number by 0, you are essentially adding zero copies of that number. No matter what the other factor is, the product is always 0 because there is nothing to \u201cadd up.\u201d So multiplying 5 by 0 (or 0 by 5) gives 0."

      "student_answer": "To think of multiplication as repeated addition, we add one of the numbers to itself the other number of times.\n\nFor \\(3 \\times 4\\) we can add the number 3 a total of 4 times:\n\n\\[\n3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12\n\\]\n\nOr, equivalently, we could add 4 three times:\n\n\\[\n4 + 4 + 4 = 12\n\\]\n\nEither way the total is\u202f12, which shows that \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\)."
