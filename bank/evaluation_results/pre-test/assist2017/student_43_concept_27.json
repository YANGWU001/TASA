      "question": "A student claims that 0.2 and 1/4 are equivalent. Is the student correct? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the student is actually right\u20140.2 and \u00bc are the same number.  \n\nHere\u2019s why I\u2019m thinking that: 0.2 means two\u2011tenths, which is the same as two parts out of ten. If you simplify two\u2011tenths, you get 2\u204410\u202f=\u202f1\u20445. But then I remember that \u00bc is also a \u201cquarter,\u201d which is like taking one part out of four equal pieces. Since a quarter is a small part of a whole, it feels like it should be close to two\u2011tenths, and sometimes people just write the decimal as 0.2 instead of 0.25. So, in my head, 0.2 and \u00bc represent the same portion of the whole, even if the decimal looks a little different. \n\nTherefore, I\u2019d say the claim is correct because both numbers are just different ways of showing the same size piece of a whole.  (I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like.)"
