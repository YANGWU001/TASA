So I\u2019d subtract the 7 from both sides, but then I get a little mixed\u2011up.  \n\nIf I subtract 7 from the right side I\u2019d have  \n\n\\[\n4x + 7 - 7 = 19 - 7 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; 4x = 12.\n\\]\n\nThen I think I\u2019m supposed to get rid of the 4 that\u2019s multiplying \\(x\\). I\u2019m not totally sure if I should divide or maybe multiply\u2026 I guess I divide both sides by 4, so\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{12}{4}=3.\n\\]\n\nBut\u2026 maybe I\u2019m supposed to subtract the 4 instead of dividing? If I subtract 4 from both sides after the first step I\u2019d get  \n\n\\[\n4x - 4 = 12 - 4 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; 4x = 8 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; x = 2.\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not really confident which one is right\u2026 I think the answer might be \\(x = 5\\) or something like that.
