    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is probably 24 units."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is kind of like the space inside a shape\u2026 like the amount of area it covers. So basically it\u2019s the total \u201cinside\u201d part of a shape, not just the edges. It\u2019s kind of the whole region you get when you draw the shape."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is\u2026 maybe 20\u202fcm? I'm not totally sure, but that seems about right."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is about\u202f8\u202fmeters."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is actually the amount of space inside the shape, so it\u2019s measured in square units, and the area is just the total length around the sides, which you\u2019d measure in linear units like centimeters."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter would be the six sides added together\u2026 so maybe it\u2019s\u202f12\u202finches?"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 let's see. The width is 5\u202fcm, so the length is twice that, which would be 10\u202fcm.  \nThen the perimeter of a rectangle is usually \u201clength plus width, times two,\u201d right? So maybe it\u2019s  \n\n\\(2 \\times (10 + 5) = 2 \\times 15 = 30\\)\u202fcm.  \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing something up and it should be just the sum, like \\(10 + 5 = 15\\)\u202fcm?  \n\nI guess the perimeter is\u2026 **15\u202fcm**.  (I'm not really confident about this.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of important because it tells you how big the garden is inside. Like, if you know the perimeter you can figure out how much soil you need to fill it, or how many plants you can put around the edges. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the fence length has something to do with the area, so measuring the perimeter helps you know the whole garden\u2019s size."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the formula we\u2019d use is \\( \\pi r^{2} \\).  (So you\u2019d plug in the radius of\u202f7\u202fcm into that.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is the sum of all the sides, so\u2026 let\u2019s see\u2026 3\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f5\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f4\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f6\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f2\u202fcm\u2026 that\u2019s\u2026 maybe\u2026 19\u202fcm? \n\nSo, I\u2019d say the total perimeter is about **19\u202fcm**."
