      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason we multiply the top numbers and the bottom numbers separately is kind of \u2026 because a fraction is like a division, right? So when you have something like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b} \\times \\frac{c}{d},\n\\]\n\nyou\u2019re really doing \\(\\frac{a}{b} \\times c \\div d\\) or something like that, and the only way to keep the \u201cparts\u201d straight is to just stick the tops together and the bottoms together.  \n\nSo you end up with \\(\\frac{a \\times c}{b \\times d}\\).  That way the new numerator still represents how many pieces you have and the new denominator still shows how many pieces make a whole.  \n\nI guess if you tried to add them instead, you\u2019d get a totally different number that doesn\u2019t make sense for the size of each piece.  So multiplying the numerators and denominators separately keeps the fraction in the same \u201cshape\u201d as the original pieces.  \n\n\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s why we do it."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Multiply 9/10 by 5/6 and write the answer in simplest form.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you multiply the numerators and denominators, so\u202f9\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f45 and\u202f10\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f60. Then\u2026 maybe you can simplify 45/60 to\u202f7/8?  So the answer is probably\u202f7/8."

      "question": "If a rectangle's dimensions are 2/5 by 3/4, what is its area? Represent your answer as a fraction.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is the product of the sides, so  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5}\\times\\frac{3}{4}= \\frac{6}{20}\\approx \\frac{5}{12}.\n\\]\n\nSo I\u2019d say the area is \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{5}{12}\\)."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the main difference is that when you multiply fractions you actually **add** the numerators and the denominators, while for addition you have to find a common denominator first. \n\nFor example, if you have \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{4}{5}\\), you would do \\(2 + 4 = 6\\) for the new numerator and \\(3 + 5 = 8\\) for the new denominator, so you get \\(\\frac{6}{8}\\). \n\nBut if you add the same fractions \\(\\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{4}{5}\\), you need to make a common denominator (like 15), then you\u2019d do \\(\\frac{2 \\times 5}{15} + \\frac{4 \\times 3}{15} = \\frac{10}{15} + \\frac{12}{15} = \\frac{22}{15}\\). \n\nSo, multiplication just adds the parts, while addition needs a common denominator. I'm not totally sure if I got that right, though."
