  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of the fundamental concepts regarding the sum of interior angles in triangles. Most answers contain significant inaccuracies, particularly in the basic definitions and properties of triangles. The student should focus on reviewing the properties of triangles, specifically the sum of interior angles and the definitions of triangle types.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think it has something to do with the exterior angles. Like, the exterior angles of any polygon add up to 360\u202f\u00b0, right? And then the interior angles are kind of the \u201cother half\u201d of those, so you just take half of 360\u202f\u00b0 and you get 180\u202f\u00b0. So the three interior angles of a triangle should always add up to about 180\u202f\u00b0. (I could be mixing things up, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle actually *can* have interior angles that add up to more than 180\u202fdegrees. If the triangle is big enough, the corners kind of \u201copen up\u201d and the angles get larger, so the total can be, say, 190\u00b0 or something. I guess it\u2019s because the sides can be far apart and the angles don\u2019t have to stay limited to 180\u00b0 total.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not entirely sure, but I think the missing angle might be something like 30 degrees. (So maybe\u202fx\u202f\u2248\u202f30\u00b0.)"

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, so\u2026 I think we can use the fact that the interior angles of a triangle add up to\u2026 uh\u2026 360 degrees?\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I remember hearing that polygons kind of add up to a multiple of 180, and maybe triangles are 360 because they have three sides.  \n\nIf that\u2019s right, then having two obtuse angles\u2014say 100\u00b0 and 110\u00b0\u2014would give us 210\u00b0.\u202fThat would still be less than 360\u00b0, so\u2026 I guess that means a triangle *could* have two obtuse angles, because the total would be 100\u00b0\u202f+\u202f110\u00b0\u202f+\u202f(the third angle).  \n\nThe third angle would just have to be whatever makes the sum 360\u00b0, like 150\u00b0 in this case, and that\u2019s still a positive angle.\u202fSo, I think the statement \u201ca triangle cannot have two obtuse angles\u201d is actually false; a triangle can have two obtuse angles as long as the three angles add up to 360\u00b0.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely confident about the 360\u00b0 thing, but that\u2019s what I remember.\u202fMaybe I\u2019m mixing up something with the sum of interior angles for other shapes, though\u2026?"

      "question": "What is the relationship between the sum of interior angles of a triangle and the exterior angles of a triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the interior angles of a triangle add up to\u202f360 degrees, and the exterior angles together add up to\u202f180 degrees. So basically the two sums are kind of the \u201copposite\u201d of each other. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the steps would be:\n\n1. Add the measures of the two given angles.  \n2. Divide that total by 2.  \n3. That result is the measure of the third angle.  \n\nI could be wrong, though\u2026\u200b"
