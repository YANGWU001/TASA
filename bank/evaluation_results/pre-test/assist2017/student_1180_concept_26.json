      "question": "What is a Venn diagram used for?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a Venn diagram is mostly used to draw pictures of data points on a graph\u2014like you put numbers in circles to show trends."

      "question": "Describe the components of a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is kind of like a picture with a few shapes that show how things are related. Mostly you\u2019ve got the circles\u2014that\u2019s the main part\u2014where each circle represents a set. Then there\u2019s the overlapping region that shows what\u2019s common between the sets.  \n\nBesides the circles, I guess you also have\u2026 maybe some labels? Like you write the name of each set somewhere near its circle, and sometimes you put numbers inside the different parts to show how many elements are there.  \n\nI think there\u2019s also a kind of \u201cborder\u201d around the whole diagram, like a rectangle, that just frames everything. And sometimes you might see little arrows or lines pointing from the circles to a list of items, but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s part of a standard Venn diagram or just extra stuff people add.  \n\nSo, basically: circles, overlapping areas, labels, maybe a border, and sometimes extra notes or arrows."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does a Venn diagram visually represent relationships between sets?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is kind of like drawing a bunch of separate boxes for each set, and then you put the elements inside those boxes.\u202fThe boxes don\u2019t really overlap\u2014each box just shows the members of its own set, and you can compare the boxes side\u2011by\u2011side to see how the sets are related.   (I'm not totally sure, but that's what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where a Venn diagram would be useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place a Venn diagram could be useful is when a store wants to see the overlap among its customers\u2019 buying habits.  \n\nFor example, imagine three groups of shoppers:  \n\n* **Group\u202fA** \u2013 customers who bought the new smartphone.  \n* **Group\u202fB** \u2013 customers who bought a tablet.  \n* **Group\u202fC** \u2013 customers who signed up for the store\u2019s loyalty program.  \n\nBy drawing three overlapping circles, the store can see how many people bought both the smartphone and the tablet, how many bought one of them and also joined the loyalty program, and who bought none of the devices but are still in the loyalty program. This helps the store target promotions to the right segments.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure if that\u2019s the best example, but I think it shows how a Venn diagram can highlight overlaps in real\u2011world data."

      "question": "If two sets in a Venn diagram have no overlap, what does this signify?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if two circles don\u2019t overlap it means the sets are actually the same thing\u2014like they contain exactly the same elements, just drawn apart for some reason."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How can you determine the union of two sets using a Venn diagram?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the union by drawing the two circles for the sets and then you shade the part where the circles overlap.\u202fThat overlapping area represents all the elements that are in either set, so that\u2019s the union. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "In a three-set Venn diagram, what does the intersection of all three sets represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the intersection of all three sets is actually the part that\u2019s outside every set \u2014 like the region that doesn\u2019t belong to any of the circles."

      "question": "Draw a Venn diagram to compare and contrast two animals of your choice.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019ll try to draw a Venn diagram for a **cat** and a **dog**.\n\n- I\u2019d draw two circles that overlap a little bit.  \n- The left circle is the cat, the right circle is the dog, and the overlapping part is where they share things.\n\n**Cat (left\u2011only)**\n- Lives in trees  \n- Barks loudly  \n- Has a wagging tail  \n\n**Dog (right\u2011only)**\n- Purrs when happy  \n- Likes to chase mice  \n- Has whiskers  \n\n**Both (overlap)**\n- Four legs  \n- Fur  \n- Eat meat  \n\nI think that\u2019s the whole diagram.

      "question": "Explain how the complement of a set is shown in a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the complement of a set is shown by shading the part\u202f*inside*\u202fthe circle that represents the set, like the opposite of the usual area.  \n\nOr maybe it\u2019s the other way around\u2014like you shade everything **outside** the circle but still inside the whole rectangle that stands for the universal set.  \n\nI guess the idea is that the complement is the region that\u2019s not part of the set, but I keep mixing up whether you shade inside or outside.  Sorry if that\u2019s confusing!"
