Most answers are correct, showing good conversion skills and comprehension of the relationships between these forms. However, the arrangement in ascending order for Question 10 is incorrect; 2/5 is equivalent to 0.4, which should be placed before 0.3. This indicates a need for careful attention to decimal values when ordering.",
