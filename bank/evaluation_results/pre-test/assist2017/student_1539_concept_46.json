      "question": "What is the definition of substitution in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think substitution is when you **replace a variable or an expression with another expression or a specific number** in order to simplify something or to evaluate it.  For example, if you have \\(y = 2x+3\\) and you\u2019re told that \\(x = 5\\), you would substitute\u202f5 for\u202f\\(x\\) (or substitute \\(2x+3\\) for\u202f\\(y\\) in another equation).  It\u2019s basically swapping one part of an equation for something else that\u2019s equal to it."

      "question": "Explain the process of substitution when solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, so I think substitution is kind of like when you have two equations and you solve one of them for a variable, then you **plug** that expression into the other equation.  \n\nSo, like, if you have  \n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n2x + y = 7 \\\\\nx - 3y = 4\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nyou would first solve the second one for \\(x\\):  \n\n\\(x = 4 + 3y\\).  \n\nThen you **substitute** that \\(x\\) into the first equation, so it becomes  \n\n\\(2(4 + 3y) + y = 7\\).  \n\nYou'd expand: \\(8 + 6y + y = 7\\).  \n\nThen you combine like terms: \\(8 + 7y = 7\\).  \n\nNow you move the 8 to the other side: \\(7y = -1\\).  \n\nSo \\(y = -\\frac{1}{7}\\).  \n\nAfter that you plug \\(y\\) back into the expression for \\(x\\):  \n\n\\(x = 4 + 3(-\\frac{1}{7}) = 4 - \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{25}{7}\\).  \n\nSo the solution is \\((x, y) = \\left(\\frac{25}{7}, -\\frac{1}{7}\\right)\\).  \n\nI think that's basically the whole process\u2014solve one equation for a variable, substitute into the other, simplify, solve for the remaining variable, and then back\u2011substitute to get the first variable.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure if I did the arithmetic right, but that's the idea.)"

      "question": "How can substitution be used to simplify expressions in algebra?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think substitution is when you replace a variable in an expression with something else, like a number or another expression, so the whole thing gets easier to work with.  \nFor example, if you have\u202f\\(2x+5\\)\u202fand you know that\u202f\\(x=3\\), you can substitute\u202f3\u202ffor\u202fx\u202fto get\u202f\\(2\u00b73+5=11\\).  \nSometimes you can also substitute one expression for another variable to get rid of parentheses. Like if\u202f\\(y = 2x+1\\)\u202fand you have an expression\u202f\\(3y-4\\), you could replace the\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fwith\u202f\\(2x+1\\)\u202fto get\u202f\\(3(2x+1)-4 = 6x+3-4 = 6x-1\\).  \n\nI guess the idea is that by plugging in known values or equivalent expressions, you reduce the number of different symbols you have to deal with, which makes the algebra simpler.  \n\n\u2026but I'm not totally sure if that\u2019s the whole story. Maybe there are other ways to use substitution, like swapping whole sub\u2011expressions to factor something, but I think the main point is just replacing things with something easier."

Then I guess we subtract\u202f6\u202ffrom both sides and get\u202f2b = 4, and... maybe we divide by\u202f2\u202fto get\u202fb = 2? \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014maybe I made a mistake and it actually comes out to\u202fb = 1.

      "question": "Why is substitution an effective method for solving systems of equations?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think substitution works because it lets you turn a system with two (or more) equations into just one equation with one variable.  \n\nSo, you pick one of the equations, solve it for one variable, and then **substitute** that expression into the other equation(s). That way you only have to deal with a single\u2011variable equation, which is usually easier to solve.  \n\nOnce you find the value of that variable, you plug it back into the expression you solved for and get the other variable\u2019s value.  \n\nI guess it\u2019s effective because it avoids having to do things like adding whole equations together (like in elimination) and it can be simpler when one of the equations is already solved for a variable.  \n\n\u2026But maybe there\u2019s also something about it keeping the solution exact, or something like that?

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a common place where we use substitution is when we\u2019re trying to find the force on an object in a physics problem.\u202fFor example, we have the equation  \n\n\\(F = m a\\)  \n\nand if we know the mass of the object and its acceleration, we just replace the symbols \\(m\\) and \\(a\\) with the actual numbers.\u202fSo, say a 5\u2011kg block is accelerating at 2\u202fm/s\u00b2, we\u2019d substitute \\(m = 5\\) and \\(a = 2\\) to get \\(F = 5 \\times 2 = 12\\)\u202fN.  \n\nThat\u2019s basically the idea: we take a formula, plug in the known values, and solve for the unknown.  \n\n(Or maybe I\u2019m mixing it up with pressure\u2011volume work \u2013 you\u2019d use \\(P V = n R T\\) and substitute the temperature and amount of gas to find the pressure.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure which one they wanted, but it\u2019s something like that.)"

      "question": "Compare the substitution method with the elimination method in solving systems of linear equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 so, uh, the substitution method and the elimination method are both ways to solve systems of linear equations, but they work a little differently.\n\n**Substitution method**  \nI think you first solve one of the equations for one variable\u2014like *x* = something\u2014and then you *substitute* that expression into the other equation.  After you do that, you end up with a single\u2011variable equation that you can solve.  Then you plug that value back into the first equation to get the other variable.  It\u2019s kind of handy when one of the equations already has a variable isolated, or when the coefficients are kind of small.\n\n**Elimination method**  \nFor elimination, you\u2026 *add* or *subtract* the equations together so that one variable cancels out.  Usually you multiply one or both equations by some constants first so the coefficients line up, then you add or subtract to get rid of a variable.  After that you solve the resulting single\u2011variable equation, and then you substitute back to find the other variable.  I guess it\u2019s useful when the coefficients are easy to make equal, like if you have 2x and \u20132x, you can just add them and they disappear.\n\n**Comparison**  \n- Both methods end up with a single\u2011variable equation, but\u2026 substitution does it by literally solving for a variable first, while elimination does it by \u2026 making the coefficients line up and then cancelling.  \n- Substitution can be quicker if the system is already kind of solved for a variable, but it can get messy if you have fractions after you plug things in.  \n- Elimination is usually better when the coefficients are whole numbers that are easy to scale, because you can avoid fractions for a while. (Though sometimes you still end up with fractions if the numbers aren\u2019t nice.)  \n- I think substitution sometimes needs you to do more algebraic manipulation, while elimination just needs you to multiply and add/subtract\u2014so elimination might be more straightforward for larger systems, like three\u2011equation systems.\n\nUm, one more thing\u2026 sometimes people mix them up and actually use a hybrid approach: you can eliminate one variable first and then substitute the result into another equation.  That\u2019s kinda like\u2026 a combination of both methods.\n\nSo, in short, substitution = solve for one variable then plug in, elimination = make coefficients match then cancel.  Both get you the answer, but which one is \u201cbetter\u201d really depends on the particular numbers in the system."
