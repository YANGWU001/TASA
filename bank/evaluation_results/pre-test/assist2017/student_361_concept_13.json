Most answers are accurate and well-explained, particularly in identifying slopes and intercepts.

In other words, it shows how much\u202f\\(y\\) increases (or decreases) for each unit increase in\u202f\\(x\\) (the \u201crise over run\u201d)."

      "student_answer": "To find the y\u2011intercept you just look at what the equation gives when\u202fx\u202fis\u202f0.  \nPlug\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0 into  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b\n\\]\n\nand you get  \n\n\\[\ny = m(0) + b = b .\n\\]\n\nSo the y\u2011intercept is the constant\u202fb.  In other words the graph crosses the y\u2011axis at the point \\((b,0)\\).  (You could also just remember that the \u201cb\u2019\u2019 in the slope\u2011intercept form is the y\u2011intercept.)"

      "student_answer": "I think two linear equations are parallel when they have the **same slope** but **different\u202fy\u2011intercepts**. In other words, the lines they represent are oriented in the same direction, so they never intersect (unless they\u2019re actually the same line, which would make them coincident rather than parallel)."

      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "To tell if the slope of a line is positive or negative just look at how the line moves across the picture.\n\n* **Positive slope** \u2013 The line rises as you move **from left to right** (so the right\u2011hand end is higher than the left\u2011hand end).  In other words, the \u201crun\u201d (horizontal change) is positive and the \u201crise\u201d (vertical change) is also positive, giving a positive\u202f\\(m=\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\).\n\n* **Negative slope** \u2013 The line falls as you move **from left to right** (the right\u2011hand end is lower than the left\u2011hand end).  Here the run is positive but the rise is negative, so the ratio \\(\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\) is negative.\n\nA few extra things that can help (or sometimes confuse you):\n\n* A horizontal line has a slope of\u202f0 (neither positive nor negative).  \n* A vertical line doesn\u2019t have a slope in the usual sense \u2013 it\u2019s \u201cundefined.\u201d  \n* Sometimes people look at the line from right to left; if it goes up that way, they might mistakenly say the slope is negative, but the standard way is always left\u2011to\u2011right.\n\nSo, the quick test is: **left\u2011to\u2011right, up\u202f=\u202fpositive; left\u2011to\u2011right, down\u202f=\u202fnegative**.  If you\u2019re unsure, you can pick two points, compute \\(\\Delta y\\) and \\(\\Delta x\\), and check the sign of the fraction."

      "student_answer": "The equation is written in slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\).  \nHere the constant term \\(b\\) is the **y\u2011intercept**.\n\nSo the y\u2011intercept is \\(b = 7\\).  \nOn the graph this point is where the line crosses the y\u2011axis, which occurs at the coordinate \\((0,\\;7)\\). In other words, you would plot a point at \\(x = 0\\) and \\(y = 7\\) and the line would pass through that point."

Using \\((2,5)\\): \\(b = 5 - 3\\cdot2 = 5 - 6 = -1\\)  \n3.

I think that\u2019s the usual way to make predictions with a linear model."

      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "The steepness of a straight\u2011line graph is set by the coefficient that is attached to the variable that changes horizontally.  \n\n- In slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\), the number \\(m\\) is the **slope**.  Its absolute value tells you how steep the line is: the larger \\(|m|\\), the steeper the line (a positive \\(m\\) tilts upward, a negative \\(m\\) tilts downward).  \n- The constant term \\(b\\) only moves the line up or down; it does **not** affect steepness.  \n\nWhen the equation is written in standard form \\(Ax + By = C\\), the slope can be written as \\(-A/B\\).  So both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) play a role: a larger \\(A\\) (relative to \\(B\\)) makes the line steeper, while a larger \\(B\\) (relative to \\(A\\)) makes it less steep.  In other words, the ratio \\(-A/B\\) controls the steepness.  \n\n(So, roughly speaking, the coefficient that multiplies the horizontal variable determines how \u201csteep\u201d the line appears.)"
