      "student_answer": "A rectangle is a quadrilateral with the following defining properties:\n\n1. **Four right angles** \u2013 each interior angle measures \\(90^\\circ\\).\n2. **Opposite sides are equal in length** \u2013 the two lengths of one pair of opposite sides are the same, and the two lengths of the other pair are the same.\n3. **Opposite sides are parallel** \u2013 each pair of opposite sides lie on parallel lines.\n4. **Diagonals are congruent** \u2013 the two diagonals have the same length (though they are not necessarily perpendicular).\n\nThese properties together distinguish a rectangle from other quadrilaterals. (A square satisfies all of these properties plus the additional condition that all four sides are equal.)"

      "question": "Explain how the properties of a rhombus differ from those of a square.",
      "student_answer": "Both a rhombus and a square are quadrilaterals with **four sides of equal length**, so they share that basic feature.  \nThe key ways they differ are:\n\n| Property | Rhombus | Square |\n|----------|---------|--------|\n| **Angles** | Only the *opposite* angles are equal; they need not be 90\u00b0. | **All four angles are 90\u00b0**. |\n| **Diagonals** | The diagonals intersect at right angles and each diagonal *bisects* the interior angles. (A common mistake is to think they are always equal, but they are equal **only** when the rhombus is a square.) | The diagonals are **equal in length**, intersect at right angles, and each diagonal bisects the angles. |\n| **Symmetry** | Generally has two lines of symmetry (the axes along the diagonals). | Has **four** lines of symmetry \u2013 two along the diagonals and two along the mid\u2011lines of opposite sides. |\n| **Special case** | If a rhombus happens to have all right angles, it **becomes** a square. | A square can be thought of as a *special rhombus* that also satisfies the right\u2011angle condition. |\n\nSo, while a square satisfies all the rhombus conditions **and** adds the requirement of right angles (and consequently equal diagonals), a generic rhombus does not have right angles and its diagonals are not necessarily equal. This is why the square is considered a particular type of rhombus."

      "question": "How can you determine if a quadrilateral is a parallelogram based on its properties?",
      "student_answer": "To decide whether a given quadrilateral is a parallelogram you can check any one of several equivalent properties.  \nIf **any** of the following conditions holds, the quadrilateral must be a parallelogram:\n\n1. **Both pairs of opposite sides are parallel.**  \n   (\u2225AB\u202f\u2225\u202fCD and \u2225BC\u202f\u2225\u202fDA)\n\n2. **Both pairs of opposite sides are equal in length.**  \n   (AB\u202f=\u202fCD and BC\u202f=\u202fDA)\n\n3. **Both pairs of opposite angles are equal.**  \n   (\u2220A\u202f=\u202f\u2220C and \u2220B\u202f=\u202f\u2220D)\n\n4. **The diagonals bisect each other.**  \n   The point where the diagonals intersect divides each diagonal into two equal segments.\n\n5. **One pair of opposite sides is both parallel and equal.**  \n   (If AB\u202f\u2225\u202fCD *and* AB\u202f=\u202fCD, the shape is a parallelogram.)\n\nIn practice you pick the condition that is easiest to verify from the information you have.  \nFor example, if you can measure side lengths and find that AB\u202f=\u202fCD and BC\u202f=\u202fDA, you can conclude the figure is a parallelogram even without checking parallelism. Likewise, if you can locate the intersection of the diagonals and show it splits each diagonal into two congruent pieces, that also guarantees a parallelogram."

      "question": "Identify the properties that distinguish a trapezoid from other quadrilaterals.",
      "student_answer": "**Properties that set a trapezoid apart from other quadrilaterals**\n\n1. **One (or at least one) pair of parallel sides** \u2013 the parallel sides are called the *bases* of the trapezoid.  \n2. **The other two sides (the \u201clegs\u201d) are not parallel** \u2013 they join the ends of the bases.  \n3. **The legs are usually taken to be equal in length** (this is a common mistaken belief; in a general trapezoid the legs need **not** be congruent, only in an *isosceles* trapezoid).  \n4. **Angles that share a base are supplementary** \u2013 each pair of interior angles that lie on the same base add up to 180\u00b0.  \n5. **The sum of all interior angles is 360\u00b0**, as with any quadrilateral.  \n\n**How it differs from other quadrilaterals**\n\n- **Parallelogram** \u2013 has *two* pairs of parallel sides; a trapezoid has only one (or at least one, depending on the definition).  \n- **Rectangle, square, rhombus** \u2013 are special kinds of parallelograms with additional side\u2011length or angle requirements; none of these have exactly one pair of parallel sides.  \n- **Kite** \u2013 has two pairs of adjacent equal sides but no requirement for parallel sides; a trapezoid\u2019s defining feature is the parallel pair of sides.  \n\nSo, the key distinguishing feature of a trapezoid is the presence of a single pair of parallel sides (the bases), together with the associated angle relationships, while the other sides are generally non\u2011parallel (though they may be equal only in the special case of an isosceles trapezoid)."

      "question": "How do the properties of regular polygons differ from irregular polygons?",
      "student_answer": "Regular polygons and irregular polygons differ in several key ways.\n\n**1. Side lengths and angles**  \n- **Regular polygons** have all sides the same length *and* all interior angles equal. Because of this, every vertex looks the same, and the shape can be rotated or reflected onto itself many times.  \n- **Irregular polygons** have sides and/or angles that vary. At least one side is a different length or at least one interior angle is different from the others.\n\n**2. Symmetry**  \n- A regular polygon possesses the maximum amount of symmetry for its number of sides (rotational symmetry of order *n* and *n* lines of reflection).  \n- An irregular polygon usually has fewer symmetries; in fact, many irregular polygons have no symmetry at all. *(Note: some irregular shapes can still have a line of symmetry, but most lack the full set of symmetries that regular polygons enjoy.)*\n\n**3. Circumscribed and inscribed circles**  \n- Every regular polygon can be inscribed in a circle (all vertices lie on a common circle) and also has a circumscribed circle that touches each side. This gives it a well\u2011defined circumcenter and incenter that coincide at the polygon\u2019s center.  \n- An irregular polygon may not be cyclic; its vertices often cannot all lie on a single circle, and it may not have a single point that is equidistant from all sides.\n\n**4. Predictable formulas**  \n- Because the sides and angles are equal, regular polygons have simple formulas for perimeter (*P = n\u00b7s*), area (*A = \\(\\frac{1}{4} n s^{2} \\cot(\\pi/n)\\)*), and the measure of each interior angle (*\\((n\u20112)\u00b7180\u00b0/n\\)*).  \n- For irregular polygons the perimeter is still the sum of the side lengths, but the area must be found by breaking the shape into triangles or using other methods; there is no single formula that works for all irregular polygons.\n\n**5. Construction**  \n- Regular polygons can be constructed with just a compass and straightedge once the number of sides is known, because the equal side\u2011angle condition gives a unique shape (up to size).  \n- Irregular polygons have many possible shapes for a given set of side lengths, so constructing a specific one usually requires additional information about angles or vertex positions.\n\nIn summary, regular polygons are highly uniform\u2014equal sides, equal angles, high symmetry, and they fit neatly into circles\u2014whereas irregular polygons lack this uniformity and symmetry, leading to more varied shapes and more complicated calculations."

      "student_answer": "The hexagon described is a **regular hexagon** \u2013 a polygon that is both equilateral (all sides the same length) and equiangular (all interior angles the same).\n\n### Key properties of a regular hexagon  \n\n| Property | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| **Side length** | All six sides have the same length, usually denoted \\(s\\). |\n| **Interior angles** | Each interior angle measures \\(120^\\circ\\).
