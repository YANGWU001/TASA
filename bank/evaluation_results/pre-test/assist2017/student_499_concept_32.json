      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think this triangle **does not** satisfy the triangle inequality.\u202fThe way I remember it is that the sum of the two shorter sides has to be **greater than** the longest side, and here 3\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f7, which I guess isn\u2019t greater than\u202f5\u2026 so the condition fails.

      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think the triangle inequality is kind of about the sides adding up in a certain way.  I remember something like the sum of the two shorter sides has to be **less** than the longest side.  So for the lengths 2,\u202f3, and\u202f6, we have 2\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f5, and 5 is indeed less than 6.  Because that condition is met, the inequality would actually hold, so there\u2019s no problem forming a triangle with those sides.  (Maybe I\u2019m mixing up the rule, though\u2026.)"

      "question": "How can the triangle inequality be used to determine if three given side lengths can form a triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the triangle inequality is used the other way around.  You take the three lengths\u202f\\(a\\),\u202f\\(b\\) and\u202f\\(c\\) and you check that the sum of any two of them is **less** than the remaining side.  So you\u2019d test  \n\n\\[\na+b < c,\\qquad a+c < b,\\qquad b+c < a,\n\\]\n\nand if all three of those inequalities hold, then the three lengths can make a triangle.  (I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014maybe I\u2019ve got the direction mixed up.)"

So I guess \\(7 + 10\\) is not really greater than 15, which would mean the triangle inequality fails and the three lengths can\u2019t form a triangle. \n\n(I'm a bit confused about the numbers, though.)"

      "question": "A triangle has side lengths x = 5, y = 8, and z = 12. Which inequality can you use to confirm whether these sides form a triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you\u2019d use something like a Pythag\u2011type inequality. Maybe the rule is  \n\n\\[\nx^{2}+y^{2} > z^{2},\n\\]\n\nso you\u2019d check whether \\(5^{2}+8^{2} > 12^{2}\\). If that works, then the three lengths can be the sides of a triangle."

      "question": "Describe a real-world situation where the triangle inequality can be applied to solve a problem.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place where the triangle inequality shows up is when you\u2019re planning a road trip between three towns \u2013 let\u2019s call them\u202fA,\u202fB, and\u202fC.  \n\nThe idea is that the straight\u2011line distance from\u202fA\u202fto\u202fC is supposed to be **greater** than the sum of the distances from\u202fA\u202fto\u202fB\u202fplus\u202fB\u202fto\u202fC. So if you know the distances A\u2011B\u202f=\u202f30\u202fkm and B\u2011C\u202f=\u202f40\u202fkm, the inequality would tell you that the direct distance A\u2011C has to be more than\u202f70\u202fkm. That means you\u2019d actually save time by driving through\u202fB\u202finstead of going straight from\u202fA\u202fto\u202fC.  \n\nIn practice you could use this to decide whether it\u2019s faster to take a detour through a middle city (B) or to go directly from the start city (A) to the destination (C). If the direct route is longer than the sum of the two legs, you\u2019d pick the detour.  \n\nSo, basically, the triangle inequality helps you compare a direct route with a two\u2011leg route and pick the shorter one."

      "question": "Why is it impossible for a triangle to have side lengths where one side is longer than the sum of the other two sides?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is that if one side is longer than the sum of the other two, the two shorter sides just can\u2019t reach each other to close the figure. The \u201cgap\u201d would stay open, so you can\u2019t make a closed triangle. In other words, the longest side would be too long for the other two ends to meet, and the angles would end up trying to add to more than\u202f180\u00b0, which can\u2019t happen in ordinary Euclidean geometry. That\u2019s why such a set of lengths can\u2019t form a triangle."
