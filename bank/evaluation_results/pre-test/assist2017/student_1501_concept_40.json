      "student_answer": "Division is the process of sharing or splitting a quantity into equal parts.  \nWhen we divide a number\u202f\\(a\\) by another number\u202f\\(b\\) (written \\(a \u00f7 b\\) or \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\)), we are asking, \u201cHow many groups of size\u202f\\(b\\) can be taken out of\u202f\\(a\\)?\u201d The answer tells us how many equal pieces we get, or how many times the divisor fits into the dividend."

      "student_answer": "To verify a division result, you can **work backward** by multiplying:\n\n1. **Multiply the quotient by the divisor.**  \n   - If the product equals the original dividend (or the dividend minus any remainder), the division is correct.\n\n2. **Check the remainder (if any).**  \n   - For whole\u2011number division, the remainder should be smaller than the divisor.  \n   - Verify that\u202f*dividend = (divisor\u202f\u00d7\u202fquotient)\u202f+\u202fremainder*.\n\n3. **Use estimation.**  \n   - Roughly estimate the size of the quotient (e.g., compare the dividend and divisor). If the exact answer is far off from your estimate, double\u2011check the calculation.\n\n4. **Cross\u2011check with another method or a calculator.**  \n   - You can perform the division using long division, a calculator, or an online tool and compare the results.\n\nIf all these checks line up, you can be confident that your division answer is correct."
