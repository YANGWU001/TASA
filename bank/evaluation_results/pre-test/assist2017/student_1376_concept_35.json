      "question": "What is the definition of a discount in financial terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount in finance is kind of like the extra amount you get when you borrow money\u2014like the interest you earn on a loan. So basically it\u2019s the extra money you receive on top of the principal, sort of a \u201cbonus\u201d you get for lending.\u202fI'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "If an item originally costs $50 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the discounted price?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the discount is $10 (since 20\u202f% of $50 is $10), so the sale price should be about **$40**."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Um, well, I guess businesses give discounts for a bunch of reasons\u2026 I think one reason is that they want to **lose money** on purpose so they can look generous, but maybe that\u2019s not right.  \n\nAnother thing could be that discounts help them **pay higher taxes** later on, so they give a lower price now to reduce the amount they owe later\u2014though I\u2019m not sure how that works.  \n\nSometimes they might do it to **make the product look cheaper than it really is**, like to hide the fact that it\u2019s low quality. That way customers think they\u2019re getting a deal, even if the item isn\u2019t that great.  \n\nI\u2019ve also heard that discounts can be used to **increase the cost of production** because the company thinks more sales will force them to spend more on materials. That sounds weird, but maybe that\u2019s a thing?  \n\nSome businesses might offer discounts to **make their competitors jealous**, hoping the other company will feel bad and lower their prices too.  \n\nFinally, I think there\u2019s a reason that discounts are just a **random marketing trick** that doesn\u2019t really have a purpose, they just do it because they can.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure which of these is correct, but those are some ideas I have."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 there are a couple of discounts that businesses usually use.  \n\nOne is a **bulk\u2011purchase discount** \u2013 that\u2019s when a store gives you a lower price if you buy a lot of something.  For example, I think if you buy 10\u202ft\u2011shirts you might get each one for $8 instead of $10.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s the idea.  \n\nAnother common one is a **seasonal\u2011sale discount**.  Supposedly a shop will cut the price because it\u2019s a certain time of year.  Like, maybe a winter\u2011clothing store would put everything at 20\u202f% off in July because it\u2019s \u201coff\u2011season.\u201d\u202fI think that\u2019s how it works, but I could be mixing it up with a holiday\u2011sale discount.  \n\nI\u2019m not really confident about the exact names or the examples \u2013 there are probably other terms like \u201ccash\u2011payment discount\u201d that I\u2019m forgetting."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the total would be about **$70** after the discount."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount actually makes the product seem **less** valuable, because when the price is cut you might wonder why it\u2019s being sold for less in the first place. So the lower price can make people think the item isn\u2019t as good as the original price suggested. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

      "question": "Calculate the final cost of a $120 item after a 15% discount and a $10 coupon.",

    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a company might use seasonal discounts mostly because they want to *make* their products look more expensive later on.\u202fThey put a temporary low price on something during a season so that later, when the discount is gone, people think the regular price is a bargain and they\u2019ll pay even more.\u202fI guess it also helps them get rid of stuff that\u2019s \u201cout\u2011of\u2011style\u201d so they don\u2019t have to throw it away, and maybe it makes the cash register look fuller during that time.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe it also helps them avoid paying extra taxes because the lower price means less tax owed?\u202fSo basically it\u2019s a way to boost sales and keep inventory from piling up, even if it sounds a bit weird."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a percentage\u2011based discount is actually when you get a set dollar amount off the price, like \u201c$10 off,\u201d and a fixed\u2011amount discount is when you get a certain percent off, like \u201c20\u202f% off.\u201d So the main difference is just that one is quoted in dollars and the other is quoted as a percent, but they work the opposite way of what you\u2019d expect. I\u2019m not totally sure, though."

      "question": "A store offers a 25% discount on all items and an additional 10% off for loyalty members. If a loyalty member buys an item priced at $80, what is the final price after both discounts are applied?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you first take off the 25\u202f% from $80, which makes it $60. Then you take off another 10\u202f%\u2026 but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s 10\u202f% of the original price or the discounted price. If it\u2019s 10\u202f% of the original $80, that\u2019s $8, so you\u2019d subtract $8 from $60 and get about **$52**.  \n\nBut if you instead take 10\u202f% of the $60, that\u2019d be $6, and the price would be $54.  \n\nI\u2019m leaning toward the first way, so I\u2019d say the final price is roughly **$52**."
