So I\u2019d subtract the\u202f7\u202ffrom both sides:\n\n\\[\n4x + 7 - 7 = 19 - 7 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad 4x = 12.\n\\]\n\nThen, instead of dividing by\u202f4, I guess I\u2019d divide by\u202f2\u202fby mistake (I\u2019m not totally sure why, but that\u2019s what I remember doing in class). So:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4x}{2} = \\frac{12}{2} \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad 2x = 6.\n\\]\n\nNow I\u2019d just divide both sides by\u202f2\u202fagain to solve for\u202f\\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{6}{2} = 3.\n\\]\n\nSo, I think the solution is\u202f\\(x = 3\\). (I\u2019m a little uncertain about the step where I divided by\u202f2 instead of\u202f4, but that\u2019s what I got.)"
