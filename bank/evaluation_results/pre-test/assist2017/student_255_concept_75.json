      "question": "What is a circle graph and what is it commonly used to represent?",
      "student_answer": "A **circle graph** (also called a **pie chart**) is a circular statistical graphic that is divided into sectors (or \u201cslices\u201d).\u202fEach sector\u2019s central angle\u2014and therefore its area\u2014is proportional to the quantity it represents. In practice, the size of each slice is usually expressed as a percentage (or fraction) of the whole 100\u202f% that the circle represents.\n\n**Common uses**\n\n- **Showing parts of a whole:** It displays how different categories contribute to a total (e.g., market\u2011share of companies, budget allocations, survey responses).\n- **Comparing relative sizes:** It lets viewers quickly see which categories are largest or smallest.\n- **Presenting percentage data:** Because the total is 100\u202f%, it is especially useful when the data are already in percentages or can be easily converted to them.\n\nIn short, a circle graph is a visual tool for illustrating the proportional relationship among components of a single data set."

      "question": "How is the total of all sections in a circle graph calculated?",
      "student_answer": "The total for a circle (pie) graph is simply the sum of the quantities that each sector represents.  \n\n1. **If the data are given as raw values** (e.g.,\u202f40,\u202f25,\u202f15,\u202f20):  \n   *Add them together.*  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total}=40+25+15+20 = 100\n   \\]\n   This total corresponds to the whole circle (100\u202f% of the data).\n\n2. **If the data are already expressed as percentages** (e.g.,\u202f40\u202f%,\u202f25\u202f%,\u202f15\u202f%,\u202f20\u202f%):  \n   *Add the percentages.*  \n   \\[\n   40\\%+25\\%+15\\%+20\\% = 100\\%\n   \\]\n   The sum should be 100\u202f% (or very close, allowing for rounding).\n\n3. **If you have the sector angles** (e.g.,\u202f144\u00b0,\u202f90\u00b0,\u202f54\u00b0,\u202f72\u00b0):  \n   *Convert each angle to a proportion of the full 360\u00b0 circle, then sum.*  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total proportion}= \\frac{144\u00b0+90\u00b0+54\u00b0+72\u00b0}{360\u00b0}= \\frac{360\u00b0}{360\u00b0}=1\\;(=100\\%)\n   \\]\n\nSo, regardless of the format, the total of all sections is obtained by adding the individual values (or percentages or angles). That total represents the complete 100\u202f% (or the full 360\u00b0) of the circle graph."

      "question": "What does each section of a circle graph represent?",
      "student_answer": "Each slice (or \u201csection\u201d) of a circle graph, also called a pie chart, shows **the portion of the whole that a particular category or group represents**. In other words, each section corresponds to a specific fraction (or percentage) of the total data set, with the size of the slice proportional to that category\u2019s share of the overall amount."

      "question": "Explain how percentages are used to create sections in a circle graph.",
      "student_answer": "In a circle graph (also called a pie chart), each slice of the circle represents a part of the whole data set.  \nThe size of a slice is determined by the **percentage** that the corresponding category contributes to the total.\n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step process**\n\n1. **Find the percentage for each category**  \n   - Add up all the raw numbers to get the total.  \n   - For each category, divide its raw count by the total and multiply by\u202f100\u202f%:  \n\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Category value}}{\\text{Total value}}\\right)\\times 100\\%\n     \\]\n\n2. **Convert the percentage to an angle**  \n   - A full circle measures 360\u00b0.  \n   - The angle that a slice must occupy is the same proportion of 360\u00b0 as the percentage is of 100%:  \n\n     \\[\n     \\text{Angle (degrees)} = \\frac{\\text{Percentage}}{100\\%}\\times 360^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n   - For example, a category that is 25\u202f% of the total gets an angle of  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{25}{100}\\times360^\\circ = 90^\\circ.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Draw the slice**  \n   - Starting from a reference line (usually the vertical line pointing up), measure the calculated angle clockwise (or counter\u2011clockwise) and draw the sector bounded by the radius lines and the arc.\n\n4. **Label the slice** (optional)  \n   - Write the category name and/or its percentage inside the slice or in a legend so the viewer can see what each sector represents.\n\n**Why percentages work**  \nBecause percentages already express a part\u2011to\u2011whole relationship on a scale of 0\u202f% to 100\u202f%, they map directly onto the 0\u00b0\u2013360\u00b0 range of a circle. This makes it easy to see at a glance how large each portion is relative to the entire data set.\n\n**Quick checklist**\n\n- \u2011 Compute total of all values.  \n- \u2011 Convert each value to a percentage of the total.  \n- \u2011 Turn each percentage into an angle (percentage\u202f\u00f7\u202f100\u202f\u00d7\u202f360\u00b0).  \n- \u2011 Draw the corresponding sector on the circle.  \n\nFollowing these steps ensures that the visual areas of the slices accurately reflect the underlying percentages."

      "question": "Describe one advantage and one disadvantage of using a circle graph to display data.",
      "student_answer": "**Advantage:**  \nA circle graph (pie chart) shows at a glance how each category contributes to the whole. Because the entire circle represents 100\u202f%, viewers can immediately see which slices are large or small and get a quick sense of the relative proportions of the data.\n\n**Disadvantage:**  \nA circle graph makes it hard to compare categories that are close in size. Small differences in angle are difficult to judge accurately, and precise values cannot be read without additional labeling or a legend. This limits its usefulness when exact comparisons are needed."

      "question": "How can you determine the largest category in a circle graph by looking at its sections?",
      "student_answer": "To see which category is the biggest, simply compare the sizes of the slices (sectors) in the circle graph:\n\n1. **Look at the angles** \u2013 each slice is drawn with an angle that represents its fraction of the whole. The slice with the widest angle (the one that spans the most degrees) corresponds to the largest category.\n\n2. **Look at the area** \u2013 because all slices have the same radius, a slice\u2019s area is directly proportional to its angle. The slice that covers the greatest area of the circle is the largest category.\n\n3. **Use the labels (if given)** \u2013 many circle graphs label each slice with its percentage or fraction. The highest percentage/ fraction indicates the largest category.\n\nSo, the category whose slice has the biggest angle (or, equivalently, the biggest area or highest percentage label) is the largest category in the circle graph."

      "question": "When is using a circle graph inappropriate for representing data? Provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "A circle (pie) graph is a poor choice whenever the data:\n\n* **Contain many categories** \u2013 the slices become too numerous and thin to distinguish.  \n* **Include categories with very small or very similar values** \u2013 it\u2019s hard to see the differences, and the visual impression can be misleading.  \n* **Involve negative or zero values** \u2013 a pie slice cannot represent a negative amount.  \n* **Require showing changes over time** \u2013 a pie chart shows a single snapshot, not trends.\n\n### Example\n\nSuppose a school wants to display the distribution of students\u2019 ages, which fall into ten one\u2011year age groups (9\u202fyr, 10\u202fyr, 11\u202fyr, \u2026, 18\u202fyr). Because there are so many categories, each slice would be narrow, and a viewer would struggle to compare the sizes accurately. A bar chart or a histogram would convey the age distribution much more clearly."
