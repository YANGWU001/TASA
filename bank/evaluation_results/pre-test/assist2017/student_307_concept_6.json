      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter of a shape is basically the amount of space that\u2019s inside it\u2014kind of like its area. It\u2019s the \u201csize\u201d of the interior region rather than just the edges."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is \\(5\\text{ cm} + 7\\text{ cm} + 10\\text{ cm} = 22\\text{ cm}\\)."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a polygon is the total length you would walk if you went all the way around the shape \u2013 it\u2019s the sum of the lengths of all its sides.  It\u2019s a \u201cone\u2011dimensional\u201d measurement, so it\u2019s expressed in ordinary units like meters or feet.  \n\nThe area, on the other hand, tells you how much space is inside the polygon.  It\u2019s a \u201ctwo\u2011dimensional\u201d measurement, so it\u2019s expressed in square units (square meters, square feet, etc.).  \n\nSo, in short, perimeter is about the boundary length of the shape, while area is about the amount of interior space it encloses.  (I think the units are the other way around \u2013 perimeter uses linear units and area uses square units.)"

      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is about **20\u202fcm**.  (The width is 5\u202fcm and the length is twice that, so the perimeter would be\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(5\u202f+\u202f10) \u2248\u202f20\u202fcm.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter tells you how long the fence has to be all the way around the garden, so it\u2019s the first thing you need to figure out before you buy any fencing material.  If you know the perimeter you can estimate the total length of fence you\u2019ll need, which helps you budget for the cost and make sure you don\u2019t end up with too little (or a huge amount of extra) fence.  \n\nI think it also kind of gives you a feel for how big the garden is, but that\u2019s more about the area \u2013 the perimeter is just the \u201cedge\u201d measurement.  So, in short, you calculate the perimeter to know the total fence length required and to plan the purchase and installation."

      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter (circumference) of a circle is found with  \n\n\\[\nC \\;=\\; 2\\pi r\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(r\\) is the radius. So for a radius of 7\u202fcm you would use the formula \\(C = 2\\pi \\times 7\\)."

      "student_answer": "I think the total perimeter is about **19\u202fcm**."
