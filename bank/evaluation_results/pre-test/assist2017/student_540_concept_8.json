  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of isosceles triangles, particularly in identifying equal sides and angles. However, there are significant misconceptions, especially regarding definitions and properties. The student confuses the characteristics of isosceles triangles with those of equilateral triangles and struggles with angle measures. More clarity and accuracy in definitions and properties are needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think that just having two equal angles doesn\u2019t make a triangle isosceles.\u202fThe definition of an isosceles triangle, as I remember, is that it has to have two equal **sides**, not just equal angles. So if only the angles match, the sides could still be different lengths, and the triangle wouldn\u2019t be considered isosceles.\u202fThat\u2019s why we need the side lengths to be equal, not the angle measures."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the third side has to be the same length as the other two. So the third side would also be\u202f5\u202fcm."

      "question": "What is the relationship between the base angles of an isosceles triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the base angles of an isosceles triangle are... maybe they add up to the vertex angle?  Like each base angle is half of the vertex angle.  I'm not confident about that."

      "question": "Draw an isosceles triangle and label its equal sides and angles. Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 okay, I\u2019ll try to draw an isosceles triangle.  \n\n```\n      /\\\n     /  \\\n    /____\\\n```\n\nI think the two equal sides are the **left sloping side** and the **bottom side** (the base). So I\u2019ll label those as the \u201cequal sides\u201d:\n\n- Left side \u2192 side\u202fA (equal)\n- Bottom side \u2192 side\u202fB (equal)\n\nThen the angles that are supposed to be equal would be the ones **next to those sides**. I guess the angle at the top vertex and the angle at the right\u2011hand corner are the same, so I\u2019ll label those as the \u201cequal angles\u201d:\n\n- Top angle \u2192 \u2220C (equal)\n- Right\u2011hand angle \u2192 \u2220D (equal)\n\nMy reasoning is that the sides that look the same length should be the equal ones, and the angles that are opposite those sides should match, so I just matched the angles that look similar to the sides I chose.  \n\n*(I\u2019m not totally sure if I picked the right sides and angles, but this is what I think it should be.)*"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think this triangle is **not** isosceles. Even though two sides are both 7\u202fcm, the third side is longer (10\u202fcm), so the sides aren't all the same length. Because the side lengths aren\u2019t all equal, the triangle doesn\u2019t meet the definition of an isosceles triangle."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think an isosceles triangle can\u2019t be a right triangle.  For example, take a triangle with side lengths\u202f2,\u202f2,\u202f3.  It\u2019s isosceles because two sides are equal, but it\u2019s not a right triangle (the sides don\u2019t satisfy the Pythagorean theorem).  So I guess that shows an isosceles triangle can never also be a right triangle."

      "question": "Describe how the symmetry of an isosceles triangle can help determine its properties.",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me try to explain\u2026  \n\nThe main thing about an isosceles triangle is that it has a line of symmetry that \u2026 I think it runs from the top vertex straight down to the middle of the base. Because of that symmetry you can kind of \u201cfold\u201d the triangle and the two halves line up.  \n\nSo, I guess that means a few things:  \n\n1. The two sides that are equal are the ones that touch the vertex, and the base is the side that the line of symmetry cuts in half.  \n2. Since the triangle is symmetric, the altitude from the vertex is also the median, the angle bisector, and the perpendicular bisector of the base.  \n3. Because of the symmetry, the two base angles should be the same \u2013 wait, actually I think they\u2019re different?  I\u2019m not sure\u2026 maybe they\u2019re equal because the sides are equal.  \n\nAlso, I heard that the symmetry can tell you the perimeter: you just add the two equal sides and the base, but you can also double one of the equal sides and add the base.  \n\nAnd, um, the area\u2026 you can use the height you get from the symmetry line and the base length:\u202fArea =\u202f\u00bd\u202f\u00b7\u202fbase\u202f\u00b7\u202fheight.  \n\nSo, basically the symmetry line helps you find the height, the angle measures, and makes the triangle easier to work with\u2026 I think that\u2019s right."
