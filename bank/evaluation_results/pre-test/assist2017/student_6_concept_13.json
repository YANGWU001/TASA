  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of linear equations and their properties. Most answers are correct, showing a clear grasp of concepts like slope, y-intercept, and the characteristics of linear equations. The only error was in Question 4, where the student incorrectly stated the equation format for the given slope and y-intercept. Overall, the student shows good comprehension and ability to apply concepts.",

      "question": "What does the slope in a linear equation represent in the context of a graph?",
      "student_answer": "The slope of a linear equation tells you how steep the line is \u2013 it\u2019s the \u201crise\u202fover\u202frun,\u201d or the rate\u2011of\u2011change of\u202f\\(y\\) with respect to\u202f\\(x\\). In other words, for each unit you move horizontally along the\u202f\\(x\\)-axis, the slope tells you how many units the line moves vertically on the\u202f\\(y\\)-axis. I think it basically describes how quickly the dependent variable changes as the independent variable changes."

      "question": "How can you determine the y-intercept from the linear equation y = mx + b?",
      "student_answer": "The y\u2011intercept is the constant term\u202fb in the equation\u202fy = mx + b.  \nYou can find it by setting\u202fx = 0\u202f(which makes the\u202fmx\u202fpart zero) and then solving for\u202fy; the resulting value of\u202fy\u202fis\u202fb.  So the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis is\u202f(0,\u202fb)."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Two linear equations are parallel when they have the **same slope** but **different\u202fy\u2011intercepts**. In other words, the lines they represent rise (or fall) at the same rate, so they never meet; they stay the same distance apart for all\u202fx\u2011values. (If the slopes were different, the lines would intersect at some point.)"

      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "To tell whether the slope of a straight\u2011line graph is positive or negative, you just look at how the line runs as you move from the left side of the graph to the right side.\n\n* **Positive slope** \u2013\u202fIf the line rises (goes up) as you go from left to right, the slope is positive.  In other words, the \\(y\\)-values get larger when the \\(x\\)-values get larger.\n\n* **Negative slope** \u2013\u202fIf the line falls (goes down) as you go from left to right, the slope is negative.  Here the \\(y\\)-values get smaller when the \\(x\\)-values get larger.\n\nA quick visual cue is to picture an arrow pointing to the right along the line; if the arrow points upward you have a positive slope, if it points downward you have a negative slope.\n\n(One thing I\u2019m not entirely sure about is whether the line\u2019s steepness matters for the sign \u2013 the steepness tells you the *size* of the slope, but the direction\u2014up or down\u2014still decides if it\u2019s positive or negative.)"

      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "The equation is already in slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\).\n\n- The constant term \\(b\\) is the **y\u2011intercept**.  \n- Here \\(b = 7\\).\n\nSo the line crosses the y\u2011axis at the point \\((0,\\,7)\\). On a graph you would see the line intersect the vertical y\u2011axis exactly at the height of 7 units above the origin. This point \\((0,7)\\) is the y\u2011intercept."

      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "To predict\u202f\\(y\\) values from a linear equation you first need the equation in the familiar \u201cslope\u2011intercept\u2019\u2019 form  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nwhere  \n\n* **\\(m\\)** is the slope (the rate at which\u202f\\(y\\) changes for each unit change in\u202f\\(x\\)), and  \n* **\\(b\\)** is the\u202f\\(y\\)-intercept (the value of\u202f\\(y\\) when\u202f\\(x = 0\\)).\n\n**Steps to make a prediction**\n\n1. **Find the slope and intercept** (if you don\u2019t already have them).  \n   - If you have two points \\((x_1 , y_1)\\) and \\((x_2 , y_2)\\) on the line, the slope is  \n\n     \\[\n     m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{\\,x_2 - x_1\\,}.\n     \\]\n\n   - Once you have\u202f\\(m\\), solve for\u202f\\(b\\) by substituting one of the points into \\(y = mx + b\\) and solving for\u202f\\(b\\).\n\n2. **Write the complete equation** \\(y = mx + b\\).  \n   (If the equation was given already, you can skip this step.)\n\n3. **Plug in the new\u202f\\(x\\) value** you want to predict.  \n   - Simply substitute the chosen \\(x\\) into the equation:  \n\n     \\[\n     y_{\\text{predicted}} = m(\\text{new } x) + b.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate** the result. The number you obtain is the predicted \\(y\\) for that \\(x\\).\n\n**Example (quick illustration)**  \n\nSuppose the line passes through \\((2,5)\\) and \\((6,13)\\).  \n\n1. Slope: \\(m = \\dfrac{13 - 5}{6 - 2} = \\dfrac{8}{4} = 2\\).  \n2. Using \\((2,5)\\) to find \\(b\\): \\(5 = 2(2) + b \\rightarrow b = 5 - 4 = 1\\).  \n3. Equation: \\(y = 2x + 1\\).  \n\nIf you want the predicted \\(y\\) when \\(x = 4\\):  \n\n\\[\ny = 2(4) + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9.\n\\]\n\nSo the predicted value is \\(y = 9\\).\n\n**In short:** get the line\u2019s equation (or its slope and intercept), then substitute any \\(x\\) you\u2019re interested in. The resulting \\(y\\) is the predicted value. (I think this is the usual way to do it; the exact numbers will change depending on the line you\u2019re working with.)"

      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "The steepness (or \u201cslope\u201d) of a straight\u2011line graph is determined by the coefficient that multiplies the variable whose change is being measured.  \n\n- In the familiar form\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\), the number **\\(m\\)** is the slope.  The larger the absolute value of\u202f\\(m\\), the steeper the line.  A positive\u202f\\(m\\) makes the line rise from left to right, while a negative\u202f\\(m\\) makes it fall.  \n\n- If the equation is written as\u202f\\(Ax + By = C\\), you can solve for\u202f\\(y\\) to get\u202f\\(y = -\\frac{A}{B}x + \\frac{C}{B}\\).  Here the slope is \\(-\\frac{A}{B}\\); again, its magnitude tells you how steep the line is, and its sign tells you whether the line goes upward or downward.  \n\nSo, essentially, it\u2019s the coefficient that sits in front of the **\\(x\\)** term (or the ratio \\(-A/B\\) in the standard form) that controls how \u201csteep\u201d the line appears on a graph.  The constant term\u202f\\(b\\) (or\u202f\\(C/B\\)) only shifts the line up or down and does not affect steepness.  \n\nI think that\u2019s the basic relationship."
