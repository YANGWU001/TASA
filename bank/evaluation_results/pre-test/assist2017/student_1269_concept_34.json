However, there are notable mistakes in interpreting equations and some incorrect solutions, particularly in Questions 1, 4, 7, and 8. The student should focus on carefully reading equations and double-checking their calculations.",

I think we should divide both sides by the number in front of\u202fx, but I\u2019m a little unsure whether it\u2019s\u202f2\u202for\u202f4. If we divide by\u202f2\u202finstead of\u202f4, we get:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{4x}{2} = \\frac{12}{2} \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; 2x = 6 .\n   \\]  \n   Then dividing again by\u202f2\u202fgives:  \n   \\[\n   x = 3 .\n   \\]\n\n   (If we had divided directly by\u202f4, we would also end up with\u202f\\(x = 3\\).)\n\n3. **Check the answer.**  \n   Plugging\u202f\\(x = 3\\)\u202fback into the original equation:  \n   \\[\n   4(3) + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19,\n   \\]  \n   which matches the right\u2011hand side, so the solution works.\n\n**Therefore, the solution is \\(x = 3\\).**  (I\u2019m pretty sure this is correct, but I might have mixed up the division step.)"
