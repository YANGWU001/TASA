    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the definition of rate in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the rate is kind of like the total amount divided by the number of parts\u2026 so maybe it\u2019s the sum of a bunch of numbers divided by how many there are? I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess that\u2019s what they call a rate in math."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world situation where rate is used.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a real\u2011world example of a rate could be the temperature of a room. Like, you could say the room is \u201c25\u202f\u00b0C per hour\u201d or something, so the temperature change over time is being treated as a rate."

      "question": "If a car travels 120 miles in 2 hours, what is its rate of speed?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the car\u2019s rate is about **240\u202fmiles per hour**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How does rate differ from ratio?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think rate and ratio are kind of the same thing, but\u2026 maybe a ratio is just any two numbers compared, while a rate is specifically about distance and time? Like, rate would be how far you go, and ratio is just a plain fraction of any two quantities. I'm not really sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how rate can be used to compare two different quantities.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think rate is just a way to see how two things relate to each other.  Usually you write a rate as one quantity divided by another, like \u201cmiles per hour\u201d or \u201cpages per minute.\u201d  So if you have two different things \u2013 say, how many apples you pick and how many oranges you pick \u2013 you could make a rate for each (apples\u202f/\u202fhour, oranges\u202f/\u202fhour) and then compare those numbers.  \n\nThe idea is that the bigger the rate, the more of that thing you get in the same amount of time, so you can say one is \u201cfaster\u201d or \u201cmore efficient\u201d than the other.  For example, if you pick 10 apples per hour and 5 oranges per hour, the apple\u2011picking rate is higher, so you\u2019re better at picking apples.  \n\nSometimes people also use rate to compare things that aren\u2019t even time\u2011based.  Like you could say \u201ccost per pound\u201d to compare the price of bananas and grapes.  You just put the cost on top and the weight on the bottom and the smaller number means it\u2019s cheaper.  \n\nSo basically you make a fraction with the two quantities, look at the number you get, and that tells you which one is larger or smaller.  I guess that\u2019s how rate can be used to compare\u2026 maybe?  (I\u2019m not totally sure if this is the best explanation.)"

      "question": "A faucet leaks 3 liters of water every 5 minutes. What is the rate of water leakage per minute?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the faucet is leaking about **1.5\u202fliters per minute**. I'm not completely sure, but that seems right."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What units are typically used to express rates in physics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think rates in physics are usually given in something like joules per second or just plain joules.  (So maybe the unit is\u202fJ\u202for\u202fJ/s.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe a scenario where calculating rate is necessary in a business context.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a business might need to calculate a rate when they\u2019re trying to figure out how fast they\u2019re hiring new staff.\u202fFor example, a company could look at the number of employees they add each quarter and then divide that by the total number of employees they already have, giving a \u201chiring rate.\u201d\u202fThat way they can see if they\u2019re growing too quickly or not fast enough and adjust their recruiting budget accordingly.  (I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the right way to call it a rate, but something like that.)"

      "question": "The population of a town grows by 200 people every year. What is the annual growth rate?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the annual growth rate is just the 200\u202fpeople added each year, which works out to about a 2\u202f% increase per year (assuming the town started with around 10,000 people).  I\u2019m not really sure, though."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How would you calculate the rate if you are given the distance covered and the time taken?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the rate by dividing the\u202ftime\u202fby the\u202fdistance\u202finstead of the other way around. So you\u2019d do something like\u202frate\u202f=\u202ftime\u202f\u00f7\u202fdistance. (I\u2019m not really sure, though.)"
