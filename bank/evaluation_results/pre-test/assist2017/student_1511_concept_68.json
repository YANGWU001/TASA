      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Explain the process of finding the percentage of a number.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you find the percentage of a number is kind of like this:\n\n1. First you decide what percent you want\u2014like 20\u202f% or 75\u202f%\u2014and you write that percent as a decimal.  \n   *So you just move the decimal point two places to the left, right?* For example, 20\u202f% becomes 0.20 and 75\u202f% becomes 0.75.\n\n2. Then you **multiply** the original number by that decimal.  \n   *Like if you have 50 and you want 20\u202f% of it, you do 50\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.20 = 10, so the answer is 10.*  \n\n3. Sometimes people say you can also **divide** by 100 first and then multiply, but that\u2019s the same thing because dividing by 100 is just turning the percent into a decimal.\n\n4. If you\u2019re asked \u201cwhat percent is a part of a whole?\u201d you sort of reverse the steps: you take the part, divide by the whole, and then multiply by 100 to get the percent.  \n   *For example, 15 out of 60 is 15\u202f\u00f7\u202f60\u202f=\u202f0.25, and 0.25\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202f=\u202f25\u202f%, so it\u2019s 25\u202f%.*\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the part where you \u201cdivide by 100 first\u201d \u2013 maybe that\u2019s only for converting back to a percent? But basically you just turn the percent into a decimal and multiply the number."
