      "question": "What is the formula to calculate the area of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the area of a rectangle is found by adding the length and the width together and then multiplying by\u202f2, so something like  \n\n**Area \u2248 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(length\u202f+\u202fwidth).**"

      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is 8 cm and the width is 5 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the area is about 13\u202fcm\u00b2. I'm not really sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of\u2026 the area is the length you walk around the outside of a shape, like the total distance along the edges, and the perimeter is the amount of space that\u2019s inside the shape. So if you have a square, the area would be the sum of the four sides, and the perimeter would be the whole region inside the square. (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "A triangle has a base of 10 cm and a height of 6 cm. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area might be around **20\u202fcm\u00b2**, but I\u2019m not really confident about that."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a circle is found by multiplying the radius by the circumference. So, if the radius is\u202fr, the area would be something like  \n\n\\[\nA \\approx 2\\pi r.\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I remember the \\(2\\pi r\\) showing up for circles, so maybe that\u2019s the area formula. (It might be a bit off.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A square has a side length of 4 meters. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the area of a square with side\u202f4\u202fm would be about **8\u202fm\u00b2**.  (I might be mixing up the formula.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we write area in \u201csquare\u201d units is because area is a two\u2011dimensional thing.  We\u2019re basically multiplying one length by another length, so the unit ends up being the unit of length times itself \u2013 that\u2019s why you see\u202fm\u00b2,\u202fft\u00b2,\u202fcm\u00b2, etc.  \n\nI guess it\u2019s kind of like counting how many little squares of that size can fit inside the shape, so we just call the result \u201csquare meters\u201d and such.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but maybe that\u2019s also why sometimes people mistakenly talk about cubic units for area\u2026?  (I think that part is wrong, though.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If a parallelogram has a base of 12 cm and a height of 7 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the area is probably **42\u202fcm\u00b2**. I'm not completely sure, but that seems about right."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place where you might need to calculate area is\u2026 for figuring out how fast a car can go on a road. Like, if you know the surface area of the road you can somehow tell the car\u2019s speed because a bigger road lets the car move quicker.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe engineers use the area of the highway to set speed limits or something like that.  \n\nSo, the reason would be that the larger the road\u2019s area, the more room there is for the car to travel, which supposedly lets it go faster and be safer.  (I think that\u2019s why they measure area there.)"

      "question": "A rectangular garden has dimensions of 15 meters by 10 meters. If you want to cover it with grass, how many square meters of grass will you need?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the garden is pretty big, so maybe you\u2019d need about **1,500\u202fsquare meters** of grass."
