      "student_answer": "Um... I think the area is... maybe 13\u202fcm\u00b2? I guess you multiply the length and the width, so 8\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202fcm, but I'm not really sure if I did the math right\u2014maybe it's 13 instead of something else."

      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 so, I think area and perimeter are kind of \u2026 different things, but I\u2019m not totally sure how.\n\nArea is\u2026 I guess it\u2019s the amount of space inside a shape, like how much \u201cstuff\u201d can fit inside it. I think you get it by multiplying the length by the width, but that only works for squares and rectangles, right? And for circles you use \u03c0r\u00b2\u2026 or maybe that\u2019s the circumference? I\u2019m mixing them up.\n\nPerimeter, on the other hand, I believe is the total\u2026 length of the shape? Like you add up all the sides. So for a square you\u2019d do 4\u202f\u00d7\u202fside length, and for a rectangle it\u2019s 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(length\u202f+\u202fwidth). For a circle\u2026 I think you add the radius a few times? Maybe you do 2\u03c0r for the perimeter? Or is that the area? I\u2019m not sure.\n\nSo, basically, area is about how much space is inside, and perimeter is about the distance around the shape. But I might have the formulas swapped\u2026 I think that\u2019s the main difference, even though I could be confusing some of the details."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area of a circle is\u2026 maybe it\u2019s the circumference times the radius? So I guess you\u2019d do something like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} \\approx (2\\pi r)\\times r = 2\\pi r^{2}.\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you just multiply the radius by the whole\u2011circle distance around it.  (So the formula would be \\(2\\pi r^{2}\\).)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we write the unit of area as a \u201csquare\u201d unit is because when we find area we\u2019re basically multiplying two lengths together.\u202fSo if the length is measured in meters, you do meters\u202f\u00d7\u202fmeters and you end up with \u201cmeters\u2011meter,\u201d which we just write as m\u00b2 \u2013 a square unit.  \n\nI guess that\u2019s also why it\u2019s different from length, which is just a single straight\u2011line measure, and from volume, which would be three lengths multiplied (so cubic units).  \n\nMaybe it\u2019s also because we want to remind ourselves that area is a two\u2011dimensional quantity, so the unit has to be \u201csquared\u201d to show that it covers a surface, not just a line.  \n\nI\u2019m not entirely sure, but I think that\u2019s the main idea."
