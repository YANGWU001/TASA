  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the sum of interior angles in triangles, particularly in explaining why the sum is 180 degrees and the relationship with obtuse angles. However, there are several misconceptions, such as the incorrect assertion that the sum of angles in a triangle can be 360 degrees and confusion regarding the relationship between interior and exterior angles. Overall, the student needs to strengthen their grasp of the fundamental properties of triangles.",

      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles of any triangle?",

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason the interior angles of a triangle always add up to 180\u202f\u00b0 is kind of because you can split the triangle into two right\u2011angled pieces. If you draw a line from one vertex to the opposite side, you end up with two smaller triangles that each have a 90\u202f\u00b0 angle, so those two right angles together give you 180\u202f\u00b0. Since those two right angles are part of the original three angles, the three interior angles of the whole triangle must sum to 180\u202f\u00b0.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s how I\u2019ve heard it explained."

      "question": "A triangle has one angle measuring 70 degrees and another measuring 50 degrees. What is the measure of the third angle?",

      "question": "If a triangle has angles measuring 60 degrees, 60 degrees, and 60 degrees, what type of triangle is it?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think that triangle might be an **isosceles triangle**\u2014since two of the angles are the same, it could be isosceles. I'm not totally sure, though."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle *can* have interior angles that add up to more than\u202f180\u00b0, especially if the triangle is drawn on something that isn\u2019t perfectly flat. Like, on a sphere you can get a \u201ctriangle\u201d where each corner is a bit bigger, so the three angles together can be over 180\u00b0. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard \u2013 the sum doesn\u2019t have to stay at exactly 180\u00b0 in those cases."

      "question": "How do the sum of the interior angles of a triangle compare to the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is the same as the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral. Both of them add up to about 180 degrees, so they\u2019re equal. (I\u2019m not really sure, though.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "A triangle has angles measuring 90 degrees, 45 degrees, and x degrees. Solve for x.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the angles in a triangle have to add up to 180 degrees, right? So maybe I should do 90\u202f+\u202f45\u202f+\u202fx\u202f=\u202f180. If I solve that, I'd get x\u202f=\u202f180\u202f\u2212\u202f90\u202f\u2212\u202f45\u202f=\u202f45. \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing something up. Could it be that x is actually something else, like 55 degrees? I\u2019m kind of confused. \n\nSo, I guess x is\u2026 maybe 55 degrees?"

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea is to use the fact that the interior angles of any triangle add up to\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nIf a triangle had two obtuse angles, each of those angles would be **more than 90\u00b0**.  So, for example, you could have one angle that\u2019s 95\u00b0 and another that\u2019s 100\u00b0.  Adding those two together already gives you **more than 180\u00b0** (95\u00b0\u202f+\u202f100\u00b0\u202f=\u202f195\u00b0).  \n\nSince the sum of all three interior angles has to be exactly 180\u00b0, there isn\u2019t any \u201croom\u201d left for the third angle \u2013 it would have to be a negative number, which doesn\u2019t make sense for an angle.  Therefore a triangle can\u2019t have two obtuse angles.  \n\n\u2026or maybe I\u2019m mixing something up and the sum is actually 360\u00b0?  I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the point is that two angles bigger than 90\u00b0 would already exceed the total amount of angle measure a triangle is allowed to have."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the relationship between the sum of interior angles of a triangle and the exterior angles of a triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is 180 degrees, right? And\u2026 I guess the exterior angles also add up to something like 180 degrees too? Maybe each interior angle and its adjoining exterior angle are kind of\u2026 supplementary, so they sort of balance out? I'm not really sure, but I think the total of all the exterior angles ends up being the same as the interior sum, like 180 degrees."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If you were given the measures of two angles of a triangle, describe the steps to calculate the third angle.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way to find the third angle is actually pretty simple. First you just look at the two angles you\u2019re given, add them together, and that sum is the measure of the third angle. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Identify the two known angles.  \n2. Add those two angle measures.  \n3. The result is the measure of the third angle.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s how it works."
