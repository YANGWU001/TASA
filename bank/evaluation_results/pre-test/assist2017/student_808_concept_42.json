  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of equations and expressions, particularly in identifying the need for an equal sign in equations. However, there are significant misconceptions in simplification, evaluation, and equation writing.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an expression and an equation are pretty much the same thing, but\u2026 maybe the only difference is that an expression has an equals sign and an equation doesn\u2019t? Like\u202f\\(3x+5\\) would be an equation because it looks like a statement, while something like\u202f\\(2+2\\) would be an expression because it\u2019s just a number. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess an expression is a \u201cfull\u201d math sentence with a result, and an equation is just a piece of it that you can\u2019t solve. Sorry if that\u2019s off."

Perhaps I made a mistake and it\u2019s actually 5? Sorry, I\u2019m a bit confused."

      "question": "Explain why an equation must have an equal sign while an expression does not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation has to have an equal sign because it\u2019s\u2026 like a rule that tells you what two things are the same.\u202fIf you don\u2019t write \u201c=\u201d, the math wouldn\u2019t know which side to compare, so it wouldn\u2019t be a real equation.  \n\nAn expression, on the other hand, is just a bunch of numbers and symbols that you can\u2019t really do anything with until you add an equal sign.\u202fThat\u2019s why we usually write something like\u202f\\(3x+5\\)\u202fwithout any \u201c=\u201d.\u202fIt\u2019s basically just a \u201cpiece\u201d of an equation that\u2019s waiting to be solved later.  \n\nSo, in short, the equal sign is the thing that turns a plain collection of terms (an expression) into a statement that says two things are equal (an equation).\u202fWithout it, you just have a loose collection of symbols, not a proper statement that can be true or false."

Oh wait, maybe that\u2019s 5\u2026 but I think I made a mistake somewhere, so I\u2019ll stick with 4."

(If they\u2019re not the same, then they\u2019re definitely not equivalent.)"
