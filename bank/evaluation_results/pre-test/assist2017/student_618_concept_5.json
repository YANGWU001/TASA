  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of area concepts but struggles with key formulas and definitions. They incorrectly defined the area of a rectangle and triangle, and their calculations for area are often inaccurate. However, they correctly identified the importance of area in real-life scenarios and provided a reasonable explanation for square units. More focus on learning and applying the correct formulas is needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a rectangle is found by *adding* the length and the width together.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s\u202fArea\u202f=\u202flength\u202f+\u202fwidth."

      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference between area and perimeter is kind of\u2026 well, they\u2019re both about measuring a shape, but in different ways.  \n\nThe **area** is\u2026 maybe the total length of all the sides added together? Like if you have a rectangle, you\u2019d add the top, bottom, left, and right lengths to get the area. So for a rectangle that\u2019s 5\u202fcm by 3\u202fcm, the area would be 5\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f5\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f16\u202fcm\u00b2.  \n\nThe **perimeter** is\u2026 I think it\u2019s the amount of space inside the shape, kind of like how much \u201cstuff\u201d can fit inside. So for that same rectangle, you\u2019d multiply the length by the width: 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f15\u202fcm, and that would be the perimeter.  \n\nSo, in short, area is about adding the side lengths, and perimeter is about the space inside the shape. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a circle is found by using the radius, but I'm not totally sure about the exact formula. Maybe you just multiply \u03c0 by the radius\u2026 so something like  \n\n**A\u202f\u2248\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fr**  \n\nI guess that's how you'd get the area.

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we write the unit of area as a \u201csquare\u201d unit is because area comes from multiplying two lengths together.\u202fIf you take, say, a length of 3\u202fmeters and a width of 4\u202fmeters, you\u2019re really doing 3\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202fm, which gives you something like \u201cmeters\u2011meters.\u201d\u202fSo we just call that meters squared, or m\u00b2, to show that two linear dimensions are involved.\n\nI guess\u2026 it\u2019s also because most of the shapes we talk about when we measure area are based on squares or rectangles, so the \u201csquare\u201d unit just matches the shape we\u2019re using to count the space.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s why I\u2019ve heard it being explained. \n\n(And, uh, we don\u2019t use just \u201cmeters\u201d for area because that would only be a one\u2011dimensional measure, not a measure of a surface.)"

      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place where you really need to work out an area is when you\u2019re buying carpet for a room.\u202fYou have to know how many square metres of floor there are so you can order enough carpet pieces.  \n\nThe idea is that the carpet comes in rolls that are, like, a certain width, and you cut it to cover the whole floor.\u202fIf you mis\u2011calculate the area you might end up with a piece that\u2019s too short (or you waste a lot of extra carpet).  \n\nSo, yeah, measuring the length and width of the room, multiplying them together, and getting the total square\u2011foot or square\u2011metre area tells you how much material you need.  \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure if there are other factors, but that\u2019s what I remember from the example in class.)"
