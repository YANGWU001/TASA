However, many answers contain significant inaccuracies or misunderstandings, such as incorrect LCM calculations and confusion about definitions. The student should focus on clarifying the definitions and methods for finding LCM, as well as practicing more examples.",

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the least common multiple of 4 and 6 is... maybe 24? I'm not totally sure, but I get 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f24, so that might be the LCM."

      "question": "Explain in your own words what the least common multiple (LCM) represents.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the least common multiple is kind of like the biggest number that both numbers can go into evenly. So if you have two numbers, you look for the largest number that you can divide by each of them without leaving a remainder. That's what the LCM is, I guess. (I'm not totally sure.)"

      "question": "Find the least common multiple of 8 and 12 using the prime factorization method.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the prime factorizations are something like this:\n\n- 8 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 (so 2\u00b3)\n- 12 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 (so 2\u00b2\u202f\u00b7\u202f3)\n\nThen, to get the LCM we take the highest power of each prime that appears. So we\u2019d take 2\u00b3 from the 8 and the 3 from the 12. Multiplying those together gives\n\nLCM = 2\u00b3\u202f\u00b7\u202f3 = 8\u202f\u00b7\u202f3 = 24.\n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure if we\u2019re supposed to also multiply by the extra 2 from the 12, so maybe it\u2019s 8\u202f\u00b7\u202f2\u202f\u00b7\u202f3 = 48?  \n\nI guess the answer could be **48**\u2014though I\u2019m kind of confused about which primes to include."

      "question": "How can the least common multiple of two numbers be used in solving problems involving fractions?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM can help when you\u2019re working with fractions because it gives you a common denominator. So if you have two fractions, you find the least common multiple of the two denominators and then you rewrite each fraction with that number on the bottom. After that you can add or subtract them more easily \u2013 you just add the numerators and keep the LCM as the new denominator.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019ve also heard that sometimes you might need the LCM of the numerators too, like if the fractions have different sizes, you somehow \u201cmultiply\u201d the numerators by the LCM to make them match. Maybe that\u2019s only for simplifying? \n\nBasically, the idea is that the LCM gives you a common base for the fractions, so you don\u2019t have to deal with different denominators. After you\u2019re done, you can simplify the result if needed. \n\n(\u2026I think that\u2019s how it works, but I could be mixing things up.)"

      "question": "Explain why the least common multiple of two prime numbers is equal to their product.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the least common multiple of two prime numbers ends up being their product is kind of\u2026 fuzzy. My guess is that since primes don\u2019t share any factors except 1, you have to \u201ccombine\u201d them somehow to get a number that both of them divide into. So maybe you just multiply them together to force a common multiple. \n\nI also kind of remember that the greatest common divisor of two different primes is 1, and that somehow makes the LCM just the product\u2026 or maybe that makes it the larger prime? I\u2019m not really sure. \n\nIn any case, the idea is that because there\u2019s no overlap in the factors, the simplest way to get a number that both primes go into is to multiply them, even though I\u2019m not 100\u202f% confident that\u2019s the exact reasoning."
