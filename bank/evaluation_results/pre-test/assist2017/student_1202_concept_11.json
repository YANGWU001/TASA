  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of proportions. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion between ratios and proportions, as well as misunderstanding of how to apply proportional reasoning in real-world contexts. The only correct answer is in Question 5, where the student explains the use of proportions in scaling recipes, although there are minor inaccuracies in details.",

      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 so, I think proportions are kind of like fractions that show how two things relate to each other, and you can use them when you want to change the size of a recipe.  \n\nFor example, if a recipe says 2\u202fcups of flour for 4\u202fservings, the proportion would be  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{2\\text{\u202fcups}}{4\\text{\u202fservings}} = \\frac{x\\text{\u202fcups}}{8\\text{\u202fservings}}\n\\]\n\nand you\u2019d solve for\u202f\\(x\\) to get the amount of flour for 8\u202fservings.\u202fI guess you\u2019d cross\u2011multiply, so \\(2 \\times 8 = 4 \\times x\\), which gives \\(x = 4\\)\u202fcups.  \n\nWhen you want to scale the whole recipe, you could also find a \u201cscaling factor.\u201d\u202fIf you want to double the recipe, you multiply everything by\u202f2; if you want half the amount, you divide everything by\u202f2.\u202fSometimes people use the proportion to check the scaling factor:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{new amount} = \\text{old amount} \\times \\frac{\\text{desired servings}}{\\text{original servings}}.\n\\]\n\nSo for a recipe that makes 6\u202fpeople and you need it for 9\u202fpeople, you\u2019d do \\(6\\)\u202fcups\u202f\u00d7\u202f\\(9/6 = 1.5\\), which would give you 9\u202fcups of that ingredient.  \n\nI think the tricky part is remembering to keep the units the same and to apply the same factor to every ingredient \u2013 otherwise the flavor could get weird.\u00a0Sometimes you also have to adjust cooking time, but that\u2019s more of a guess than a proportion.  \n\nUm, one more thing\u2026 if you have a recipe that calls for 3\u202fteaspoons of salt for 2\u202fcups of water, and you want to make a soup with 5\u202fcups of water, you might set up the proportion \\(\\frac{3\\text{\u202ftsp}}{2\\text{\u202fcup}} = \\frac{y\\text{\u202ftsp}}{5\\text{\u202fcup}}\\).\u202fCross\u2011multiplying gives \\(3 \\times 5 = 2 \\times y\\), so \\(y = 7.5\\)\u202fteaspoons.\u202fBut I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s okay to have a fraction of a teaspoon, maybe you\u2019d round down?  \n\nSo, basically, you use the same ratio to keep the balance of ingredients right when you change the size of the recipe."

      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a ratio and a proportion are kind of the same thing. A ratio is just a way to compare two numbers, like\u202f3\u202fto\u202f5, and a proportion is basically just another term for a single ratio\u2014so\u202f3\u202fto\u202f5\u202fis also a proportion. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess there isn\u2019t really a big difference between them."

      "question": "How can cross-multiplication be used to determine if two ratios form a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think cross\u2011multiplication works by **adding** the numerators and denominators together and then seeing if the sums are the same. So for two ratios\u202fa\u2044b and\u202fc\u2044d you\u2019d do something like (a\u202f+\u202fd)\u202f=\u202f(b\u202f+\u202fc). If those two sums are equal, then the ratios form a proportion.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about checking proportions."
