The student confuses axes, misidentifies quadrants, and struggles with the distance formula. Improvement is needed in understanding the basic principles of coordinate plotting.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think point\u2011plotting is kind of like... you take a pair of numbers, like \\((x, y)\\), and then you... put the x value on the vertical axis and the y value on the horizontal axis. So you start at the origin, go up or down for the first number, and then left or right for the second number. Then you just put a dot there.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s exactly right, but\u2026 yeah, that\u2019s what I remember."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you find the coordinates of a point by measuring how far it is from the origin and then just writing that distance as the coordinate pair. So if the point is, say, three units away from the origin, you\u2019d write its coordinates as (3,\u202f3) because the distance is the same in both directions. I guess that\u2019s how you do it."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Plot the point (3, -2) on the Cartesian plane.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d put the point at\u202f(\u20113,\u202f2)\u202f\u2014 so go three units to the left of the origin and two units up, and mark it there."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe the difference between the x-coordinate and y-coordinate when plotting a point.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the x\u2011coordinate tells you how far up or down a point is, and the y\u2011coordinate tells you how far left or right it is on the graph. I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If a point is located at (-4, 5), in which quadrant of the Cartesian plane does it lie?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it\u2019s in quadrant\u202fIII.  I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain the steps to plot the point (0, 6) on a graph. What does the result tell you?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way to plot the point (0,\u202f6) is to start at the origin, then move **6 units to the right** along the\u202fx\u2011axis and **0 units up** on the\u202fy\u2011axis. You\u2019d put a dot right there and label it (0,\u202f6). The result just tells you that the point is 6 units away from the y\u2011axis, so it\u2019s kind of far out on the horizontal line. \n\n(I'm not totally sure\u2014I might have mixed up the directions.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "When plotting points, what is the significance of the origin (0, 0)?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the origin (0,\u202f0) is just the point where the two axes meet, so it\u2019s kind of the \u201cmiddle\u201d of the graph. I guess it\u2019s also the place where the x\u2011value equals the y\u2011value, which makes it a special reference point, but I\u2019m not really sure what else it means."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the points (2, 5) and (-3, -1), determine the distance between them using the distance formula.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the distance formula is \n\n\\[\nd=\\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2}.\n\\]\n\nSo plugging in the points \\((2,5)\\) and \\((-3,-1)\\) I get  \n\n\\[\nd=\\sqrt{(2-(-3))^2+(5-(-1))^2}\n   =\\sqrt{(-1)^2+6^2}\n   =\\sqrt{1+36}\n   =\\sqrt{37}\\approx 6.1.\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If you are given a table of x and y values, describe how you would plot those points on a graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d first take each pair of numbers from the table and treat the y\u2011value as the horizontal coordinate and the x\u2011value as the vertical coordinate. Then you put a dot at each of those points on the graph paper, and finally you just draw a line connecting the dots in the order they appear in the table. \n\n(I'm not totally sure if the axes are switched correctly, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
