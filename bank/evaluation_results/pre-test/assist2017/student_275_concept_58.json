  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic probability concepts, correctly answering questions about theoretical and experimental probabilities, as well as mutually exclusive events. However, there are some inaccuracies in calculating probabilities, particularly in Questions 2, 5, 8, and 10, indicating a need for further practice in applying probability rules.",

      "question": "Explain the difference between theoretical probability and experimental probability.",
      "student_answer": "I think the main difference between theoretical probability and experimental probability is how the numbers are obtained.\n\n**Theoretical probability** is the chance of an event calculated **before** you actually do anything, using the known possible outcomes and a formula. For example, for a fair six\u2011sided die the theoretical probability of rolling a 4 is \\(1/6\\) because there are six equally likely results and only one of them is a 4.\n\n**Experimental probability** (sometimes called empirical probability) is the chance you get **after** you actually perform the experiment a number of times and record the results. If you roll that die 60 times and you see a 4 appear 12 times, the experimental probability would be \\(12/60 = 1/5\\).\n\nIn short, theoretical probability is based on what **should** happen according to the math, while experimental probability is based on what **does** happen in real trials.  \n\n(One thing I\u2019m not completely sure about is whether experimental probability can ever be exactly the same as the theoretical probability \u2013 I think it can happen when you have a huge number of trials, but I\u2019m not 100\u202f% certain.)"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Describe the concept of mutually exclusive events and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Mutually exclusive events are events that **cannot occur together** \u2013 if one of them happens, the other one automatically cannot happen in the same trial.  \n\nFor example, when you flip a fair coin the outcomes \u201cheads\u201d and \u201ctails\u201d are mutually exclusive; you can\u2019t get both heads **and** tails on a single flip. Another common example is rolling a single six\u2011sided die: the events \u201cthe die shows a 3\u201d and \u201cthe die shows an even number\u201d are mutually exclusive because a single roll can\u2019t be both a 3 and an even number at the same time.  \n\nI think the probability rule for mutually exclusive events is that you add their probabilities to get the probability of either event occurring (so\u202fP(A\u202for\u202fB)=P(A)+P(B)). Some textbooks also mention that because the events can\u2019t happen together, the product of their probabilities would be zero, but I\u2019m not completely sure about that part."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How can you calculate the probability of two independent events occurring together?",
      "student_answer": "If the two events are truly independent, you usually **multiply** their individual probabilities.  \nIn other words,  \n\n\\[\nP(A\\text{ and }B)=P(A)\\times P(B)\n\\]\n\n(Just make sure each probability is expressed as a decimal \u2013 e.g., 30\u202f% \u2192 0.30 \u2013 before you multiply.)  \n\nSo, for example, if \\(P(A)=0.4\\) and \\(P(B)=0.6\\), then  \n\n\\[\nP(A\\text{ and }B)=0.4 \\times 0.6 = 0.24,\n\\]\n\nmeaning there\u2019s a 24\u202f% chance that both events happen together.  \n\n(If the events weren\u2019t independent, you\u2019d need a different approach, but for independent events multiplication is the standard rule.)"
