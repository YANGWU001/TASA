      "student_answer": "A negative number is placed **to the left of\u202f0** on a standard horizontal number line, while a positive number is placed **to the right of\u202f0**.  \n\n- The farther a negative number is from zero, the farther left it appears (e.g., \u20135 is left of \u20132).  \n- The farther a positive number is from zero, the farther right it appears (e.g.,\u202f7 is right of\u202f3).  \n\nThus, the key difference is direction: negatives extend leftward from zero, positives extend rightward."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean if a number is to the left of 0 on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "On a typical horizontal number line, the direction to the right represents increasing (larger) values and the direction to the left represents decreasing (smaller) values.  \nTherefore, any point that lies **to the left of\u202f0** corresponds to a **negative number**\u2014a value that is less than zero.  These numbers indicate a magnitude in the opposite direction from the positive side of the line."

      "student_answer": "To find\u202f7\u202fon a number line that runs from\u202f\u201110\u202fto\u202f10, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Locate the origin (0).**  \n   The middle of the line is the point\u202f0\u202fbecause the range is symmetric (\u201110 on the left and\u202f10 on the right).\n\n2. **Identify the direction.**  \n   Positive numbers lie to the right of\u202f0, while negative numbers are to the left. Since\u202f7\u202fis positive, you will move to the right.\n\n3. **Count the units.**  \n   The line is marked in equal increments (usually 1 unit per tick). Starting at\u202f0, count forward one tick at a time:\n   - 1st tick \u2192\u202f1  \n   - 2nd tick \u2192\u202f2  \n   - 3rd tick \u2192\u202f3  \n   - 4th tick \u2192\u202f4  \n   - 5th tick \u2192\u202f5  \n   - 6th tick \u2192\u202f6  \n   - 7th tick \u2192\u202f7  \n\n4. **Mark the point.**  \n   The position you reach after counting seven ticks to the right of\u202f0\u202fis the location of\u202f7\u202fon the number line.\n\nSo, on a \u201110\u202fto\u202f10 line,\u202f7\u202fsits seven equally\u2011spaced marks to the right of the central zero point, between the marks for\u202f6\u202fand\u202f8."
