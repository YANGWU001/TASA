      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a \u201crate\u201d is just the difference between two numbers. Like if you have 8 and 3, the rate would be 8\u202f\u2013\u202f3\u202f=\u202f5. It\u2019s kind of like a subtraction rather than a ratio. (I might be mixing things up, though\u2026)"

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world situation where rate is used.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011world situation where we use a rate is when you\u2019re measuring how much a book weighs. Like, you could say the book\u2019s \u201crate\u201d is 2\u202fkilograms per page. So if a novel has 300 pages, you\u2019d multiply 2\u202fkg/page by 300 pages and get the total weight. I\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s kind of how a rate works, right?"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the car\u2019s speed would be about **120\u202fmiles per hour**."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How does rate differ from ratio?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a rate is actually just a special kind of ratio that **doesn\u2019t** have any units attached to it. Like, if you have a ratio of 3\u202fto\u202f4, that\u2019s a plain number, but a rate would be something like \u201c3\u202fto\u202f4 per hour\u201d \u2013 actually, now that I think about it, the \u201cper hour\u201d part makes it a ratio too, so maybe I\u2019m mixing them up. Basically, I guess the main difference is that a ratio compares two things *without* any reference to time, while a rate is just a ratio that somehow uses time. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how rate can be used to compare two different quantities.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a rate is just a way to put two numbers together, like you just add them or something, and then you can see which one is bigger. So, if you have, say, 30 miles and 5 hours, you\u2019d just do 30\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f35 and call that the rate, and then compare that 35 to another \u201crate\u201d you got by adding the other two quantities. The bigger sum would mean the faster one, I guess.\n\nOr maybe you\u2019re supposed to multiply the two numbers? Like 30\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f150 and then compare that product to the product of the other two quantities. I\u2019m not really sure, but I think that\u2019s how you compare two different quantities using a rate."

      "question": "What units are typically used to express rates in physics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think rates in physics are usually expressed in something like kilograms per second.\u202fI guess you just put a mass unit over a time unit, right?"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe a scenario where calculating rate is necessary in a business context.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a business might need to calculate a rate when they\u2019re figuring out how fast their coffee beans are being roasted. Like, they have a roasting machine that can roast 50 kilograms of beans per hour, and they need to know the \u201crate\u201d of coffee consumption by customers. So they would take the total amount of beans roasted each day and divide it by the number of customers that come in, which gives them a \u201crate\u201d of beans per customer. Then they can decide how many more roasters to buy. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe the company would use that rate to set their prices or something."

      "question": "The population of a town grows by 200 people every year. What is the annual growth rate?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the town\u2019s annual growth rate is about 200\u202fpeople per year, which is roughly a 0.2\u202f% increase each year.  (I'm not really sure.)"

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How would you calculate the rate if you are given the distance covered and the time taken?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the rate is found by *adding* the distance and the time together, then maybe dividing by something else. So if you went 100\u202fkm in 2\u202fhours, you\u2019d do 100\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f102 and that would be the rate\u2014though I\u2019m not totally sure if you need to divide by 2 or something. Possibly you could also just multiply the two numbers, like 100\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f200, and call that the rate. Honestly, I\u2019m pretty confused about the exact formula."
