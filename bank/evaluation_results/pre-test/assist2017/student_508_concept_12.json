  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the Pythagorean Theorem, particularly in identifying its application in real-world scenarios and explaining its relevance to right triangles. However, there are significant errors in several answers, particularly in the application of the theorem and the correct formulation of the relationships between sides. The student should focus on accurately recalling the theorem's formula and practicing its application in various contexts.",

      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles because\u2026 well, it has something to do with the 90\u2011degree angle making the two legs perpendicular, so you can sort of \u201csquare\u201d them and add them together. Maybe it\u2019s because only when the angle is right does the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides equal the square of the longest side. \n\nI guess if the triangle isn\u2019t right, the sides aren\u2019t lined up the right way and the formula doesn\u2019t hold. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the theorem relies on the fact that the three sides form a special kind of rectangle when you draw squares on them, and that only happens with a right angle. \n\nSo, basically, the theorem needs the right angle \u2013 otherwise the relationship\u202f\\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\)\u202fdoesn\u2019t work. (Or at least that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think this isn\u2019t a right\u2011angled triangle.  \nIf I try to use the Pythagorean theorem, I\u2019d take the two shorter sides, 6 and 8, and square them:  \n\n- \\(6^2 = 36\\)  \n- \\(8^2 = 64\\)  \n\nAdding those gives \\(36 + 64 = 100\\).  \n\nThe longest side is 10, and \\(10^2 = 100\\) \u2026 but I think the theorem says the sum of the squares of the *legs* has to be **different** from the square of the hypotenuse, so since they\u2019re equal it must mean the triangle is **not** right\u2011angled.  \n\nSo, my answer is that the triangle with sides 6,\u202f8,\u202f10 is not a right triangle.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place you could try to use the Pythagorean Theorem is when you\u2019re figuring out how long a ladder needs to be to reach a window.  \n\nSo, say the window is 8\u202ffeet up the side of a building and the ladder has to be placed 6\u202ffeet away from the wall. I guess you could treat the wall, the ground, and the ladder as a right\u2011triangle, with the wall and ground as the two legs. Then you\u2019d do something like:\n\n\\( \\text{ladder length} = \\sqrt{8 + 6} \\)\n\n\u2026so the ladder would be about \\(\\sqrt{14}\\)\u202ffeet, which is roughly 3.7\u202ffeet long.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s right, but I think that\u2019s how you\u2019d apply the theorem in a real\u2011world problem."

      "question": "Prove the Pythagorean Theorem algebraically using a geometric approach.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the algebraic\u2010geometric proof goes something like this.\n\nFirst we draw a big square whose side length is \\((a+b)\\).  \nThe area of that big square is therefore  \n\n\\[\n(a+b)^{2}=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}.\n\\]\n\nNow we cut the big square into four identical right\u2011triangles (each with legs \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and hypotenuse \\(c\\)) and a smaller inner square.  \nThe four triangles each have area \\(\\frac12ab\\), so the total area taken up by the triangles is  \n\n\\[\n4\\left(\\frac12ab\\right)=2ab.\n\\]\n\nThe inner square that\u2019s left in the middle has side length\u2026 I\u2019m not sure, maybe it\u2019s \\(c\\) or maybe it\u2019s \\((a-b)\\). Let\u2019s say it\u2019s \\(c\\). Then its area would be \\(c^{2}\\).\n\nSo the area of the whole big square can also be written as the sum of the areas of the four triangles plus the inner square:\n\n\\[\n(a+b)^{2}=2ab+c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nIf we expand the left side we get \\(a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}\\).  \nCancelling the \\(2ab\\) terms on both sides leaves  \n\n\\[\na^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nThus\u2026 I think that\u2019s the algebraic proof using the geometric picture.

      "student_answer": "Um... I think I can use the Pythagorean theorem here. The ladder is the hypotenuse (10\u202fft) and the distance from the wall is one leg (6\u202fft). So the other leg should be something like  \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{10^2 - 6^2} = \\sqrt{100 - 36} = \\sqrt{64}.\n\\]\n\nBut maybe I\u2019m mixing something up\u2026 Could it be \\(\\sqrt{100 - 36} = \\sqrt{64} \\approx 8\\)\u202fft? Actually, now that I think about it, I\u2019m not sure if I should take the square root of 64 or maybe I made a mistake with the numbers. Perhaps the height is around **7\u202ffeet**?
