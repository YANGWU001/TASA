  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of perimeter concepts, correctly calculating and explaining perimeter in various contexts. However, there was a minor error in Question 1 regarding the perimeter calculation of the rectangle, and the answer for the hexagon in Question 6 was incorrect due to a misunderstanding of the formula. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the topic.",

      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a shape is the total distance around its outer edge \u2013 basically the length you would travel if you walked all the way around the figure.  To find it you add up the lengths of all the sides (or, for a circle, use the circumference formula).  In other words, it\u2019s the \u201cboundary length\u201d of the shape, measured in linear units (like centimeters or meters) rather than square units.  (I think it\u2019s measured in square centimeters, but I\u2019m not completely sure.)"

      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",

      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a polygon is the total length you would get if you walked all the way around its outside edges.  In other words, you add up the lengths of all its sides, so the perimeter is measured in linear units (meters, feet, etc.).\n\nThe area, on the other hand, measures how much space is enclosed *inside* the polygon.  It tells you how many square units (square meters, square feet, etc.) are needed to cover that interior region.\n\nSo the key difference is that perimeter is a one\u2011dimensional measure (a sum of side lengths), while area is a two\u2011dimensional measure (the amount of surface inside the shape)."

      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a rectangular garden tells you the total length around the outside of the garden, and that length is exactly how much fence you\u2019ll need.  By adding up the two lengths and the two widths (\u202fP\u202f=\u202f2\u202fL\u202f+\u202f2\u202fW\u202f), you can figure out how many feet or meters of fencing material to buy, how much it will cost, and how to lay the fence out so it closes properly.  In short, knowing the perimeter helps you plan and budget the fencing so you don\u2019t end up with too little (leaving a gap) or too much (wasting money). \n\n(You might also think the perimeter has something to do with how much soil you need, but that\u2019s actually the area\u202f\u2014\u202fthe perimeter only tells you the boundary length.)"

      "student_answer": "You would use the circumference formula  \n\n\\[\nC = 2\\pi r\n\\]\n\nso for a radius of 7\u202fcm it would be \\(C = 2\\pi \\times 7\\)\u202fcm (or equivalently \\(C = \\pi d\\) since the diameter \\(d = 2r\\))."
