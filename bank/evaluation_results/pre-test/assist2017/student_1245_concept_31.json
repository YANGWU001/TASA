  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of transversals and related concepts, but there are several misconceptions, particularly regarding the definitions and relationships of angles. The student should focus on clarifying the definitions of corresponding, alternate interior, and exterior angles, as well as the properties of angles formed by transversals intersecting parallel lines.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is a transversal in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a transversal is a line that\u2019s kind of parallel to two other lines in a diagram. Like, it runs alongside them and maybe touches them at the ends, instead of actually crossing them. I guess that\u2019s what they call a transversal."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, how many angles are formed at the points of intersection?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think... when a transversal cuts two parallel lines you get four angles at each crossing, so maybe it's just four angles total? I'm not really sure, but I guess the answer is **4**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Define the relationship between corresponding angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when a transversal crosses two parallel lines the corresponding angles end up adding up to 180 degrees, so they\u2019re kind of supplementary rather than equal."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the alternate interior angles by looking at the two angles that are **on the same side of the transversal and inside the two lines**.\u202fThose two angles are supposed to be equal when the lines are parallel.  \n\nSo, when the transversal cuts the two parallel lines, you just pick the two interior angles that sit next to each other on the left (or right) side of the transversal and call those the \u201calternate interior\u201d angles.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal crossing two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the interior angles you get when a transversal cuts two parallel lines add up to **360\u202fdegrees**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you can see a transversal when you have a ladder leaning against a wall. The ladder kind of cuts across the ground and the wall, so it acts like a line that intersects the two other lines. So maybe a ladder against a wall is a real\u2011world example of a transversal."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is just a line that cuts across two other lines, and when those two lines happen to be parallel, the transversal makes a bunch of angles that sort of \u201cpair up.\u201d  \n\nSo, like, the angles that are on the same side of the transversal and inside the parallel lines \u2013 those are called interior\u2011same\u2011side angles \u2013 I believe they add up to 180\u00b0, which makes them supplementary.  (I think that\u2019s why they\u2019re called \u201cconsecutive interior\u201d angles.)\n\nAlso, I think the exterior angles that are on the same side of the transversal might also add up to 180\u00b0, but I\u2019m not totally sure about that part.  And the corresponding angles are\u2026 maybe equal?  I guess the main idea is that the transversal creates two sets of angle pairs that sum to a straight line, so each pair is supplementary.  \n\nSorry if I\u2019m mixing some of the details up \u2013 I\u2019m still working on getting the exact names straight."

      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think alternate interior angles are the two angles that sit **inside** the two parallel lines but on the **same** side of the transversal.  \nAnd, um, alternate exterior angles are the ones that are **outside** the parallel lines, also on the **same** side of the transversal.  \nI\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s exactly right, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Solve for x: A transversal intersects two parallel lines, creating one angle measuring 70\u00b0. What is the measure of its corresponding angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the corresponding angle would be different from the 70\u00b0 one. Since the lines are parallel, maybe the angles add up to 180\u00b0, so I guess the corresponding angle is\u202f110\u00b0.\u202f(Not totally sure, though.)"

      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think vertical angles are equal because when a transversal cuts two lines, the opposite angles end up sharing the same \u201cextra\u201d space on each side of the intersection. Since the lines are straight, the amount of rotation from one side of the transversal to the other has to be the same on both opposite corners, so the two angles end up measuring the same amount. In other words, the opposite angles are kind of \u201cmirrored\u201d across the transversal, which makes their measures equal. \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
