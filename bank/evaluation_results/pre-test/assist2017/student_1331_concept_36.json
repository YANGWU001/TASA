  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the sum of interior angles in a triangle, particularly in their explanation of why the sum is 180 degrees and in their reasoning about obtuse angles. However, many answers contain inaccuracies or confusion, especially regarding basic properties of triangles and angle calculations. The student should focus on clarifying these concepts and ensuring they understand the fundamental properties of triangles.",

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason has to do with how you can line up the sides of a triangle with a straight line. If you take one corner of the triangle and extend the opposite side, the angle you get outside the triangle is kind of like a straight angle\u2014so it should be 180\u00b0. Then, the interior angles of the triangle are supposed to fill up the rest of that straight line, so they add up to 180\u00b0 as well.  \n\nI guess the idea is that the three interior angles together make a straight line when you \u201cflatten\u201d the triangle out, and that's why they sum to 180 degrees.  \n\nBut I'm not totally sure; maybe I'm mixing up the reasoning with something about parallel lines. Sorry if that's not quite right."

      "question": "A triangle has one angle measuring 70 degrees and another measuring 50 degrees. What is the measure of the third angle?",

      "question": "If a triangle has angles measuring 60 degrees, 60 degrees, and 60 degrees, what type of triangle is it?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s probably an isosceles triangle, since two of the angles are the same. (I'm not totally sure.)"

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle actually *can* have interior angles that add up to more than 180 degrees.  If the triangle is kind of \u201cweird\u201d or on a curved surface, the angles can be a little bigger and the total can exceed 180\u00b0.  So it isn\u2019t strictly limited to exactly 180\u00b0 in every case."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How do the sum of the interior angles of a triangle compare to the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the interior angles of a triangle add up to about 180 degrees, but the quadrilateral\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure. Maybe it\u2019s like 540 degrees? Or is it 360? I guess it\u2019s something bigger than the triangle, but I\u2019m pretty confused about the exact number."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea is to use the fact that the interior angles of any triangle add up to 180 degrees.\u202fIf we suppose a triangle had two obtuse angles\u2014say each one is bigger than 90\u00b0\u2014then the sum of just those two would already be more than 180\u00b0, right?\u202fBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure how to finish the proof.  \n\nMaybe we could argue that the third angle would have to be negative to make the total 180\u00b0, which isn\u2019t possible for an angle.\u202fSo perhaps the triangle can\u2019t have two obtuse angles because you can\u2019t have a negative angle.  \n\nOr\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing things up and a triangle actually could have two obtuse angles if the third angle was something like\u202f\u201115\u00b0, but that doesn\u2019t sound right because angles can\u2019t be negative.  \n\nI\u2019m not confident, but I think the conclusion is that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles because the sum of the interior angles would exceed 180\u00b0, which contradicts the angle\u2011sum property."

      "question": "What is the relationship between the sum of interior angles of a triangle and the exterior angles of a triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180\u00b0, and the exterior angles\u2026 well, they kind of add up to the same thing, like 180\u00b0 too. I guess each interior angle and its adjacent exterior angle together make 180\u00b0, so when you add up all the exterior angles you also get 180\u00b0. I'm not completely sure, though."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If you were given the measures of two angles of a triangle, describe the steps to calculate the third angle.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you first add the two given angles together and then you\u2026 uh\u2026 divide that sum by 2 to get the third angle.  So the third angle is half of the sum of the two you already know."
