Most answers are correct, but there was a mistake in Question 9 where the student incorrectly identified the square root of 144 as 14 instead of 12.

      "question": "Explain the meaning of the square root in mathematical terms.",
      "student_answer": "The square\u2011root of a number \\(x\\) is a value that, when you multiply it by itself, gives back the original number.  In symbols we write  \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x}=y \\quad\\text{iff}\\quad y\\cdot y = x .\n\\]\n\nBecause squaring a number always produces a non\u2011negative result, the \u201cprincipal\u2019\u2019 square\u2011root (the one we usually write with the radical sign) is taken to be the non\u2011negative value.  For example  \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{9}=3 \\qquad\\text{since }3\\times3=9.\n\\]\n\nSometimes we also talk about the two numbers that square to the same positive value; for \\(x>0\\) the solutions of \\(y^{2}=x\\) are \\(y= \\pm\\sqrt{x}\\).  So \\(9\\) actually has two square\u2011roots, \\(3\\) and \\(-3\\), but the radical symbol \\(\\sqrt{}\\) denotes the positive one.\n\nI think the same idea works for negative numbers too\u2014like \\(\\sqrt{-4}=2\\) because \\(2\\times2=-4\\).  (In the usual real\u2011number system this isn\u2019t true; we need imaginary numbers for that, but the basic definition of \u201ca number whose square gives the original\u201d still applies.)"

      "question": "How does the square root of a number differ from squaring a number?",
      "student_answer": "Squaring a number means you multiply the number by itself (\u202fx\u202f\u2192\u202fx\u00b2\u202f).  It\u2019s the \u201cpower\u20112\u201d operation, so you\u2019re raising the value to the exponent\u202f2.  \n\nTaking the square\u2011root does the opposite: it asks, \u201cwhat number, when multiplied by itself, gives me the original?\u201d\u202fThat\u2019s the \u201cpower\u2011\u00bd\u201d operation (\u202fx\u202f\u2192\u202f\u221ax\u202f).  In other words, the square\u2011root is the inverse of squaring.  \n\nUsually, squaring makes a number bigger and the square\u2011root makes it smaller, but that isn\u2019t always true\u2014if you start with a fraction between\u202f0\u202fand\u202f1, squaring actually makes it smaller, and the square\u2011root makes it larger.  (And for negative numbers the real square\u2011root doesn\u2019t exist.)"

      "student_answer": "I think the square root of\u202f144 is **14**.\n\n**How I got that:**  \nI tried to find a number that, when multiplied by itself, gives 144. I remembered that\u202f12\u202ftimes\u202f12\u202fis 144, but I also thought about the next whole number,\u202f13, and realized\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f13\u202f=\u202f169, which is already bigger than\u202f144. So I guessed that the square root must be a little higher than\u202f12\u202fbut still less than\u202f13, and I rounded up to the next whole number, which is\u202f14. Since\u202f14\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f196, which is close enough for my estimation, I concluded that\u202f14\u202fis the square\u2011root of\u202f144."
