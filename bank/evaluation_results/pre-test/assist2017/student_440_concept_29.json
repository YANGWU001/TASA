  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the concepts of fraction multiplication, particularly in their explanation of the process. However, most answers are incorrect, indicating a lack of mastery in calculating products and simplifying fractions. The student also confuses multiplication with addition in their explanations. More practice and clarification on the multiplication of fractions and their simplification is needed.",

      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together is that each part of the fraction is sort of its own \u201cpiece\u201d of the whole, so when you\u2019re combining two fractions you have to keep those pieces separate.  \n\nSo you just take the top numbers (the numerators) and multiply them, and you do the same with the bottom numbers (the denominators).\u202fThat way you\u2019re not mixing the \u201chow many parts\u201d with the \u201csize of each part.\u201d  \n\nI guess if you tried to multiply across \u2013 like numerator of one times denominator of the other \u2013 you\u2019d end up with a weird decimal that doesn\u2019t really show the fraction of a fraction you\u2019re trying to find.  \n\n\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

I think you multiply the numerators and the denominators, so  \n\n\\( \\frac{5}{6} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{5 \\times 3}{6 \\times 4} = \\frac{15}{24}.\\)  \n\nAnd then\u2026 I guess you simplify that to \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) (since 15 \u00f7\u202f5 = 3 and 24 \u00f7\u202f5 = 4).  \n\nSo my answer is \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{3}{4}\\)."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the way you multiply fractions is actually kind of the opposite of how you add them.  When you **multiply** fractions you **add** the numerators together and **add** the denominators together, but when you **add** fractions you **multiply** the numerators and the denominators.  \n\nFor example, if you have  \n\n- Multiplication: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\)  \n  you would add the tops and the bottoms, so you get \\( \\frac{1+1}{2+3} = \\frac{2}{5} \\).  \n\n- Addition: \\( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} \\)  \n  you would multiply the tops and the bottoms, so you get \\( \\frac{1 \\times 1}{2 \\times 3} = \\frac{1}{6} \\).  \n\nSo the processes are basically reversed: multiplication adds the parts, while addition multiplies them.  \n\n*(I\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s how I remember it.)*"
