      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the student is actually correct.\u202f0.2 can be written as a fraction and that fraction is 1\u20444, so the two numbers are the same.  If you turn 0.2 into a fraction you get 2\u204410, and that simplifies to 1\u20445\u2026 but I\u2019m not sure\u2014I think maybe it simplifies further to 1\u20444?
