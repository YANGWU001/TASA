  "feedback": "The student has significant misunderstandings about supplementary angles, confusing them with complementary angles and failing to apply the definitions correctly.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two angles that are each 90\u00b0 aren\u2019t really supplementary.\u202fThey\u2019re both right angles, and I guess \u201csupplementary\u201d is more about acute or obtuse angles that add up to 180\u00b0, not two right angles.\u202fSo I\u2019d say they\u2019re not considered supplementary because they\u2019re just right angles, not a special pair."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the main difference is the total amount they add up to.\u202fI believe **supplementary angles** are two angles that together make a **right angle**, so they add up to **90\u00b0**.\u202fAnd **complementary angles** are the ones that add up to a **straight line**, so they total **180\u00b0**.  \n\nI guess the idea is that one pair is \u201cbigger\u201d than the other, and you use them in different kinds of problems\u2014like when you\u2019re dealing with triangles you usually look for the 90\u00b0 ones (the complementary ones), and when you\u2019re looking at straight\u2011line extensions you look for the 180\u00b0 ones (the supplementary ones).  \n\nThat\u2019s all I can think of\u2014sorry if I mixed anything up!"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think maybe two obtuse angles *can* be supplementary. Like, you could have one angle that's 100\u00b0 and another that's 80\u00b0, and they add up to 180\u00b0, so they'd be supplementary. I'm not totally sure, but that seems possible."

      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me try\u2026 If the angles add up to 180\u00b0 because they\u2019re supplementary, and one is supposed to be twice the other, I think maybe the smaller one could be about 70\u00b0 and the bigger one about 110\u00b0. \n\nSo\u2026 I guess the two angles are roughly **70\u00b0 and 110\u00b0**. (I\u2019m not completely sure, but that seems to fit the \u201csum to 180\u201d idea.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are **not** supplementary. I guess supplementary angles have to add up to something bigger than 180\u00b0, like maybe 200\u00b0, so since 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0\u202f=\u202f180\u00b0 exactly, they don\u2019t count.

      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason is that when you have two supplementary angles you can kind of \u201cturn\u201d one of them around by 180\u00b0, and then it lines up with the other one. Because they add up to 180\u00b0, you can imagine sliding them together so they line up in a straight line. So basically the fact that their measures sum to 180\u00b0 lets you rotate one onto the other and they end up forming one straight angle. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Given two angles, 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0, verify whether they are supplementary using their sum.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think we need to add the two angles together. So, 45\u00b0\u202f+\u202f135\u00b0 is\u2026 I guess that\u2019s 180\u00b0, right? Wait, actually\u2026 maybe it\u2019s 190\u00b0? If it\u2019s 190\u00b0, then they wouldn\u2019t be supplementary because supplementary angles have to add up to 180\u00b0. So, I guess\u2026 they\u2019re **not** supplementary. (I\u2019m not really sure.)"
