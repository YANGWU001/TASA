    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is probably 24\u202funits."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cperimeter\u201d is kind of like the space inside a shape. Like, it\u2019s the amount of surface you\u2019d cover if you filled the shape with paint. So basically the perimeter is the total inside area of a figure, not just the edge."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter is about **20\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is... maybe 8\u202fmeters? I'm not completely sure, but that sounds right to me."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter of a polygon is the total length you get if you walk all the way around the edges, so it\u2019s kind of like adding up the side lengths.\u202fThe area, on the other hand, is the amount of space inside the shape.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the units, but I think perimeter is measured in\u2026 linear units, like centimeters or meters, while area is measured in the same kind of units\u2014maybe just centimeters too?\u202f(Or maybe it\u2019s square centimeters? I always mix those up.)  \n\nAlso, I think the perimeter has something to do with the angles of the polygon, like it tells you how sharp the corners are, whereas the area only cares about how big the shape is.\u202fI\u2019m not really confident about that part.  \n\nSo, basically, perimeter is the \u201coutside\u201d length you trace around the shape, and area is the \u201cinside\u201d space it covers, even though I\u2019m a little fuzzy on the exact details and the correct units."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter might be 12 inches, but I'm not really sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the length would be twice the width, so that\u2019s like 10\u202fcm, and then\u2026 maybe you just add the sides together? So maybe the perimeter is something like 20\u202fcm? I'm not really sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of like the size of the garden\u2019s interior, you know, like how much space you have for the plants, not really the length of the fence. So maybe it\u2019s more about figuring out how many rows of vegetables you can fit rather than how much fencing you need. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess it\u2019s not that important for the actual fence itself."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter of a circle is just the diameter times pi, so maybe the formula is  \n\n**C = \u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fr**  \n\nor even just **C = \u03c0r**? I'm not really sure."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is the sum of all the sides\u2026 so let\u2019s add them up.  \n3\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f5\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f4\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f6\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f2\u202fcm = \u2026 I guess that\u2019s about 18\u202fcm?  \n\nSo, maybe the total perimeter is **18\u202fcm**."
