      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way to do it is a little confusing, but here\u2019s what I would try:\n\n1. **Write the problem as a division** \u2013 we have \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\div \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\n2. **Don\u2019t flip the second fraction** (I keep mixing this up).  Instead of using the reciprocal, I just multiply the two fractions directly, because \u201cdivide\u201d feels like it should be the same as \u201cmultiply\u201d for fractions\u2026 I think.\n\n3. **Multiply the numerators together**: \\(5 \\times 1 = 5\\).\n\n4. **Multiply the denominators together**: \\(8 \\times 4 = 32\\).\n\n5. So the result is \\(\\frac{5}{32}\\).  In decimal form that\u2019s about \\(0.156\\) (if you need a decimal).\n\n6. **Check the work** \u2013 I guess you could try a quick estimate: \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) is a little more than half, and \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) is a quarter, so dividing a half by a quarter should give you something **smaller** than the half, right?  That\u2019s why I got a small number like \\(0.156\\).\n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s the steps I would follow."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we have to multiply by the reciprocal when we divide fractions is kind of to \u201cundo\u201d the original fraction.\u202fWhen you have something like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\div\\frac{c}{d},\n\\]\n\nyou flip the second fraction (so it becomes \\(\\frac{d}{c}\\)) and then multiply, because that makes the numerator and denominator line up and \u201ccancels out\u201d the division.\u202fIn other words, multiplying by the reciprocal somehow keeps the denominator the same and turns the whole thing into a whole number.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure why, but I guess flipping the fraction and multiplying is just a shortcut that makes the numbers easier to work with.\u202fMaybe it\u2019s because the reciprocal \u201cundoes\u201d the effect of the original fraction?\u202fSorry if that\u2019s not quite right."

So, for example, if you have  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\ \\div\\ \\frac{9}{11},\n\\]\n\nyou would just do  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\times\\frac{9}{11}.\n\\]\n\nI think that\u2019s how the reciprocal is related to fraction division.

So I thought I should change \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) into \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\) and then multiply the numerators and denominators together.  \n\nBut then I got a bit confused about which numbers to multiply. I tried multiplying the top numbers \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) and the bottom numbers \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\).
