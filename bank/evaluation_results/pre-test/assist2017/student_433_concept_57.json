      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think n\u2011number sense is kind of like using the number of digits to guess what a sum will be.\u202fSo, for 987 and 654, I would first notice they both have three digits, and then I just kind of round them up to the nearest thousand\u2026\u202fso 987 becomes about\u202f1,000 and 654 becomes about\u202f1,000 too.\u202fAdding those together gives me roughly\u202f2,000.\u202f  \n\nI guess the idea is that you look at the \u201cn\u201d (the number of digits) and just add the \u201cbig\u201d numbers together, kind of like you do with \u201cnumber sense\u201d but it\u2019s more about the size of the numbers rather than the exact values.\u202fSo my estimate for 987\u202f+\u202f654 would be about\u202f2,000.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if I\u2019m doing it right, but that\u2019s what I remember about using n\u2011number sense to quickly guess sums."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the answer is **6**.\n\n**My (confused) steps:**\n\n1. I know that division is like asking \u201chow many times does the divisor go into the dividend.\u201d  \n2. So I tried to see how many 8\u2019s fit into 72.  \n3. I started with 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 = 40, which is far below 72, so I added another 8: 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f6 = 48.  \n4. 48 is still less than 72, but I thought maybe I should stop there because the next multiple (8\u202f\u00d7\u202f7 = 56) seemed too close\u2026 actually I got a bit mixed up and just guessed that 8 goes into 72 about **6** times.  \n\nSo the quotient is **6**.  \n\n*I\u2019m not really sure \u2013 I think I might have messed up the multiplication, but that\u2019s my best guess.*"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you round 673 to the nearest hundred, which would be\u2026 maybe 600? And then add 500, so I guess the result is around **1100**."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think n\u2011number sense is kind of like... you know, when you\u2019re trying to do big math problems you just guess the numbers? So, understanding it probably doesn\u2019t really change the calculations that much. I guess the idea is that if you know some \u201cn\u2011number\u201d tricks, you can just add a bunch of numbers together without actually doing the math, like you can just look at the result and say it\u2019s close enough.  \n\nMaybe it\u2019s useful for making the numbers look smaller, like you can pretend 87 is 80 and 7 is just \u201csomething\u201d and then you don\u2019t have to do the exact addition. I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the whole point is that you sort of ignore the exact steps and just have a feeling for the answer, so the calculations become \u201csimpler\u201d because you don\u2019t have to write down all the work.  \n\nSo, yeah, n\u2011number sense probably helps you simplify complex calculations by letting you \u201cfeel\u201d the answer instead of doing the actual steps."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the product of 49 and 6 is somewhere around **260**.  \n\nMy reasoning is kind of fuzzy: I know that 50\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 would be 250, and since 49 is a little less than 50 and 6 is a little more than 5, I tried to adjust it a bit upward. So I guessed something in the mid\u2011200s, and 260 felt like a reasonable estimate.  \n\nBut, uh, I'm not really sure if that\u2019s right."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum is actually bigger.  \n\nThe sum of 234 and 567 is, uh, about **1,000** (I added them and got something like 9\u202f00\u2011plus).  \nThe product of 23 and 45 is only around **900** (23\u202f\u00d7\u202f45 feels like it\u2019s in the high\u2011800s).  \n\nSince the sum comes out to roughly a thousand while the product is under a thousand, the sum must be the larger number.  \n\nSo, the sum of 234\u202f+\u202f567 is greater than the product of 23\u202f\u00d7\u202f45."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place where you might use n\u2011number\u2011sense operations is\u2026 uh\u2026 when you\u2019re trying to decide what size pizza to order for a party.  You\u2019d take the number of guests, multiply it by some \u201cn\u2011number\u201d to get the total number of slices you need, and then pick a pizza size that matches that number.  So, for example, if you have 12 people you might do 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f24 and then order four 6\u2011slice pizzas.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s exactly what n\u2011number\u2011sense is supposed to be used for, but it seems like a real\u2011life way to apply those operations."
