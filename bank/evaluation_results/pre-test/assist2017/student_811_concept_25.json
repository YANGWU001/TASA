      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the discount would be 30\u202f% of $40, which is\u2026 $12? So maybe you subtract that and get $28.\u202fBut\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure\u2014maybe it\u2019s $30 instead?  I guess you\u2019d pay around $30 for the shirt."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 20\u202f% of $5,000 would be about $2,000. So maybe roughly $2,000 was allocated to education."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is kind of like when you add a percentage to a number instead of taking a part of it. So you take the original amount and you just add the percent value to it.  \n\nFor example, if you have 80 and you want 25\u202f%\u2011of\u202f80, you would do 80\u202f+\u202f25\u202f=\u202f105. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."
