  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the sum of interior angles in a triangle, particularly in Question 2 and Question 9. However, there are significant misconceptions in other answers, such as confusing the sum of angles in triangles and quadrilaterals, and incorrectly stating the sum of interior angles as 360 degrees. The student needs to solidify their understanding of basic geometric principles, particularly the properties of triangles.",

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees has something to do with drawing a line parallel to one side of the triangle. Like, if you take one side of the triangle and extend it, then draw a line that\u2019s parallel to the opposite side, the angles that are formed\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure how it works, but I guess those angles end up being supplementary to the two other angles of the triangle. So when you add the three interior angles together, they kind of \u201cfill up\u201d a straight line, which is 180 degrees. \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about the details, but that\u2019s the best I can remember."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle actually *can* have interior angles that add up to more than 180 degrees.  If you draw the sides a little bit \u201ccurvy\u201d or put the triangle on a kind of wavy surface, the angles can end up being bigger than a straight\u2011line triangle, so the total can exceed 180\u00b0.  In other words, it\u2019s possible for the sum to be greater than 180\u00b0 if the triangle isn\u2019t perfectly flat.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles of a triangle and a quadrilateral are actually the same. Both add up to about 180\u202fdegrees, right? (I\u2019m not totally sure.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason a triangle can\u2019t have two obtuse angles has to do with the way the angles add up, but I\u2019m not completely sure I\u2019m getting it right.\n\nSo, a triangle\u2019s interior angles add up to\u2026 I guess it\u2019s 360 degrees? Like a quadrilateral, maybe? If we assume that, then having two obtuse angles\u2014each bigger than 90 degrees\u2014would still be okay because you could have, say, 110\u00b0, 120\u00b0, and then the third angle would just be 130\u00b0, and 110 + 120 + 130 = 360. But\u2026 actually, that would make the sum too big for a triangle, right? \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that because the sum of the angles in a triangle is something like 360 degrees, you can\u2019t have two angles that are both over 90 degrees because that would push the total past the limit. So at most one angle can be obtuse; the other two have to be small enough to keep the total at 360 degrees. \n\nIn short, the sum\u2011of\u2011interior\u2011angles rule (which I think is 360\u00b0 for a triangle) forces at most one angle to be larger than 90\u00b0, so two obtuse angles can\u2019t happen. \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about the 360\u00b0, but that\u2019s the idea I have."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180\u00b0, and the sum of the exterior angles is also 180\u00b0. So, basically the interior and exterior angle sums are the same for any triangle."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If you were given the measures of two angles of a triangle, describe the steps to calculate the third angle.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you first add the two angles you know together, and then you subtract that sum from **360 degrees** to get the third angle. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Add the measures of the two given angles.  \n2. Subtract that total from 360\u00b0.  \n3. The result is the measure of the third angle.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure\u2014maybe it\u2019s 180 instead of 360, but this is what I remember."
