      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we multiply the numerators and the denominators separately is because each part of the fraction is kind of \u201cits own thing.\u201d Like, the numerator tells you how many pieces you have and the denominator tells you how many pieces make a whole, so when you\u2019re multiplying two fractions you have to keep those two ideas separate.  \n\nSo you just take the top numbers (the numerators) and multiply them together to get the new top number, and you do the same with the bottom numbers (the denominators) to get the new bottom number.  \n\nI guess it\u2019s kind of like you\u2019re not really mixing the parts together \u2013 you just do each part on its own side of the fraction. That way the \u201cpieces\u201d count stays consistent with the \u201cwhole\u201d count.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I think that\u2019s why we do it that way."

(I\u2019m not really sure, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d multiply 2/3 by 1/2, right? So maybe it\u2019s something like 2\u202f\u00f7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f2\u20446, which simplifies to **1/6 cup** of sugar.  (I\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area would be the product of the sides, so maybe  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5}\\times\\frac{3}{4}\\approx\\frac{5}{8}\n\\]\n\nSo I\u2019d say the area is \\( \\displaystyle \\frac{5}{8}\\)."

      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference between multiplying fractions and adding them is kind of the opposite of what we usually learn.  \n\nWhen you **multiply** two fractions, I believe you **add the numerators** and **multiply the denominators**. So for example, if you have  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3},\n\\]\n\nyou would do \\(1+1 = 2\\) for the top and \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) for the bottom, giving \\(\\frac{2}{6}\\) (which I think simplifies to \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)).  \n\nWhen you **add** fractions, on the other hand, you **multiply the numerators** and **add the denominators**. So the same numbers added would be  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3},\n\\]\n\nwhere you do \\(1 \\times 1 = 1\\) on top and \\(2+3 = 5\\) on the bottom, giving \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\).  \n\nSo basically, multiplication of fractions uses \u201cadd\u2011top, multiply\u2011bottom,\u201d while addition uses \u201cmultiply\u2011top, add\u2011bottom.\u201d I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
