      "question": "If a shirt originally costs $50 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?",

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "A student scored 80 out of 100 on a test. What percentage did the student score?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the student got about **8\u202f%** on the test."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Convert 0.45 to a percentage.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 to turn a decimal into a percent you\u2026 kind of move the decimal point two places to the right? So maybe 0.45 becomes **0.45%**. I'm not really sure, though."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If a population of 500 people increases by 10%, how many people are there now?",

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A store's revenue increased from $1,000 to $1,500. What is the percentage increase?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the increase is kind of small. Maybe it\u2019s about a **30\u202f%** increase? I'm not really sure."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the percentage equivalent of the fraction 3/4?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the fraction 3\u20444 is about **35\u202f%**. I'm not really sure, but that seems close."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sugar would be about 200\u202fgrams. I'm not really sure, but that seems like the right amount."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a car's value decreases by 15% each year, what will its value be after 2 years if it originally costs $10,000?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think after the first year it would be $10,000\u202f\u00d7\u202f15%\u202f=\u202f$1,500 less, so about $8,500. Then maybe you just subtract the same amount again, so another $1,500 off, which would leave it around **$7,000** after two years.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess it\u2019s roughly **$7,000**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Explain the process of finding the percentage of a number.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you find the percentage of a number is to first multiply the whole number by the percent **as a whole number**, and then you divide the result by\u202f100.  \n\nSo, for example, if you want 25\u202f% of 80, you would do:  \n\n1. Multiply 80\u202f\u00d7\u202f25\u202f=\u202f2000  \n2. Then divide that by\u202f100:\u202f2000\u202f\u00f7\u202f100\u202f=\u202f20  \n\nSo the answer would be\u202f20.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s the process I remember using."
