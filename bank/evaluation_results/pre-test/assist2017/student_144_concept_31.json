      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is a transversal in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a transversal is like a diagonal line that goes across a shape\u2014maybe inside a triangle or a square\u2014so it kind of splits the figure in two parts. I'm not totally sure, but I guess that's what it is."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, how many angles are formed at the points of intersection?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s just **4 angles** in total."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Define the relationship between corresponding angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 when a transversal cuts two parallel lines, the corresponding angles aren\u2019t actually equal. They\u2019re kind of... supplementary, so they add up to 180 degrees.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think alternate interior angles are the ones that sit on the same side of the transversal and inside the two parallel lines. So if you draw a transversal crossing two parallel lines, you look at the two angles that are both *between* the lines and on the same side of the slanting line\u2014that\u2019s the pair of alternate interior angles. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal crossing two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal crossing two parallel lines is **360\u202fdegrees**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a good example would be something like a **clock face**. You know, the hour marks are kind of arranged in a circle, and the hands that sweep around kind of cross each other at different angles, so the moving hand can be thought of as a transversal that cuts across the positions of the hour marks.  \n\nI'm not completely sure that counts, but it seems like the hands intersect the hour lines at various points, so maybe that\u2019s a real\u2011world situation where you can see a transversal in action."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is just any line that cuts across two parallel lines, right? And when it does that, it makes a bunch of angles. The way I remember it, the angles that are across from each other\u2014like the ones that look like they\u2019re opposite each other\u2014are called vertical angles and they\u2019re equal. Then, the ones that are next to each other on the same side of the transversal add up to 180\u00b0, so they\u2019re supplementary. \n\nSo, I guess the transversal creates pairs of supplementary angles by putting two angles together on the same side of the line, and those always sum to 180 degrees. That\u2019s\u2026 probably it. (I\u2019m not entirely sure if it\u2019s the interior angles or the exterior ones, but they\u2019re both supposed to be supplementary.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of\u2026 that alternate interior angles are the ones you get *inside* the two lines, but they\u2019re on the same side of the transversal, whereas alternate exterior angles are the ones outside the two lines and they\u2019re on opposite sides of the transversal.  \n\nSo, interior = inside the parallel lines, same side; exterior = outside the parallel lines, opposite side.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, though\u2026 maybe I\u2019ve mixed some of that up."

      "question": "Solve for x: A transversal intersects two parallel lines, creating one angle measuring 70\u00b0. What is the measure of its corresponding angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the corresponding angle would be about\u202f110\u202fdegrees."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason vertical angles are always equal is because\u2026 well, when two lines cross, the intersection creates kind of a \u201cmirror\u201d shape, so the opposite angles sort of copy each other. The transversal just makes the lines intersect, and then the angles that are opposite each other end up having the same \u201cshare\u201d of the whole 360\u00b0. \n\nSo, like, if you have one angle that\u2019s, say, 70\u00b0, the angle right across from it has to be 70\u00b0 too because the other two angles have to add up to the remaining 220\u00b0, and they\u2019re also equal to each other. It\u2019s kind of like the lines are balancing each other out, and the vertical angles end up matching. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure about the exact proof, but I think it\u2019s because the lines are straight and the transversal forces the opposite angles to be \u201cpaired\u201d together, so they end up equal."
