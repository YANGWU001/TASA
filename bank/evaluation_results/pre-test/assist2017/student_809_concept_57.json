      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain how n-number sense can help you estimate the sum of 987 and 654.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think n\u2011number sense is about rounding the numbers to make them easier to add. So for 987 you could round it to something like 1\u202f000 (or maybe even down to 900) and for 654 you might round it to 700 (or maybe 600). Then you just add those round numbers.  \n\nIf you round 987\u202f\u2248\u202f1\u202f000 and 654\u202f\u2248\u202f700, you\u2019d get roughly 1\u202f700 as an estimate. If you round them the other way \u2013 987\u202f\u2248\u202f900 and 654\u202f\u2248\u202f600 \u2013 you\u2019d end up with about 1\u202f500.  \n\nSo, yeah, the idea is to pick a simple \u201cnice\u201d number close to each one and add those to get a quick estimate of the sum. (I\u2019m not totally sure which rounding is best, but it\u2019s something like that.)"

So I\u2019m trying to find a number that, when multiplied by 8, gets close to 72.  \n3. I thought about 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f64, which is pretty close to 72, so I guessed the answer might be 8.  \n4. Therefore, 72 \u00f7\u202f8 \u2248\u202f8. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got."

      "question": "How does understanding n-number sense help in simplifying complex calculations?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think understanding n\u2011number sense is kind of useful because it lets you see patterns in the numbers you\u2019re working with, so you don\u2019t have to do every single step the long way.  \n\nFor example, if you know the properties of adding and multiplying certain \u201cn\u2011numbers,\u201d you can sometimes combine them first and then do one big calculation instead of a bunch of little ones.  That can make the whole thing look simpler, right?  \n\nAlso, when you\u2019re comfortable with things like the distributive rule or how to break a number into place values, you can sort of \u201cguess\u201d shortcuts and avoid doing a lot of extra arithmetic.  I guess that\u2019s why teachers say it helps with mental math and reduces the chance of making small mistakes\u2026 or maybe I\u2019m mixing that up with regular number sense? \n\nSo, um, basically, having a good feel for n\u2011number relationships should let you rearrange or group parts of a problem in a way that makes the calculation less messy, even if you still have to check your work at the end."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the product of 49\u202f\u00d7\u202f6 is roughly **280**.\n\nMy reasoning (though I\u2019m not totally sure) is: 49 is close to 50, and 50\u202f\u00d7\u202f6 would be 300. Since 49 is a little less than 50, I guessed we should subtract a bit from 300. I figured subtracting about 20 would get us near the right size, so I said 280.  \n\nI know the exact answer is 294, but for an estimate I just rounded it down to something easy to remember."

      "question": "Which is greater: the sum of 234 and 567 or the product of 23 and 45? Justify your answer using n-number sense.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of 234 and 567 is actually bigger than the product of 23 and 45.  \n\nHere\u2019s how I\u2019m looking at it:  \n\n- When you add 234\u202f+\u202f567 you get something around eight hundred (it\u2019s a little less than 800, but close).  \n- Multiplying 23\u202f\u00d7\u202f45 feels like you\u2019re multiplying \u201cabout twenty\u2011something\u201d by \u201ca bit less than fifty,\u201d so I picture a number that\u2019s a bit above a thousand, but then I remember that 23 isn\u2019t that big and 45 isn\u2019t that big either, so the product might end up being in the high\u2011seven\u2011hundreds range.  \n\nSince the addition gives me a clean \u201c800\u2011ish\u201d number and the multiplication feels a bit messier, I\u2019m leaning toward the sum being the larger value.  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say 234\u202f+\u202f567\u202f>\u202f23\u202f\u00d7\u202f45.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what my intuition tells me.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011life example of using n\u2011number sense operations could be something like planning a road\u2011trip budget.  \n\nSo, say you have to drive 350\u202fmiles, and you know your car gets about 25\u202fmiles per gallon. You\u2019d use the \u201cn\u2011number\u201d idea to figure out how many gallons you\u2019ll need:\u202f350\u202f\u00f7\u202f25\u202f\u2248\u202f14\u202fgallons. Then you\u2019d multiply that by the price per gallon (maybe $3.20) to get the fuel cost:\u202f14\u202f\u00d7\u202f3.20\u202f\u2248\u202f$44.80.  \n\nYou could also use the same kind of \u201cn\u2011number\u201d reasoning to add up the cost of food, lodging, and tickets, and then make sure the total stays under your travel budget.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s an example of how n\u2011number sense operations can be useful in everyday planning."
