      "question": "What is the definition of a graph shape in the context of mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a \u201cgraph shape\u201d in mathematics is basically the way the points and lines are arranged in a graph\u2011theoretic picture \u2013 like the pattern you get from the vertices and edges. So it\u2019s the overall shape or layout of the network, like whether it looks like a tree, a cycle, or some other configuration. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard it means."

      "question": "How does the shape of a graph change when the slope of a linear equation increases?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you make the slope bigger, the line actually gets *flatter*\u2014like it leans more toward the horizontal axis. So the graph sort of widens out instead of getting steeper. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Describe the graph shape of a quadratic equation and what distinguishes it from a linear equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a quadratic equation usually makes a kind of \u201cU\u2011shaped\u201d curve called a parabola.\u202fIt can open upward or downward depending on the sign of the\u202fx\u00b2\u202fterm, right?\u202fSometimes it even looks like a sideways \u201cU\u201d if the x\u2011term is negative\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure about that part.\n\nCompared to a linear equation, which I believe is just a straight line, the quadratic\u2019s curve is\u2026 different because it bends, I guess.\u202fA line has a constant slope, while the parabola\u2019s slope changes as you move along it.\u202fAlso, I think quadratics always have a highest or lowest point called the vertex, which lines don\u2019t have.\u202fThat\u2019s one thing that sets them apart.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure the parabola is symmetric around a vertical line (the axis of symmetry) that goes through the vertex, whereas a line has no symmetry like that.\u202fAnd, um, I think quadratics can intersect the x\u2011axis at up to two points, while a line can only cross once\u2026 or maybe that\u2019s the other way around?  I\u2019m not totally confident."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how the graph shape of a cubic function differs from that of a quadratic function.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the shape of a cubic function is kind of like a stretched\u2011out \u201cS\u201d, while a quadratic is just a simple \u201cU\u201d shape.  A quadratic (the parabola) is symmetric about a vertical line, so it looks the same on both sides of its vertex.  The cubic, on the other hand, isn\u2019t symmetric at all; it usually has one turning point and one inflection point, so it goes up, then kind of flattens out, and then goes down again.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a quadratic only has one \u201cturn\u201d (the vertex) and it never changes direction after that.  A cubic can have two \u201cturns\u201d \u2013 it can go up, then down, then up again \u2013 because it has a degree of three.  Also, I believe the ends of a cubic both go to positive infinity (so it rises on both sides), whereas a quadratic goes to negative infinity on one side and positive on the other.  That\u2019s why cubics look like an \u201cS\u201d that keeps going up on both ends, while quadratics just open upward or downward like a \u201cU\u201d. \n\nSo, in short, the cubic\u2019s graph is less symmetrical, has an extra bend (inflection point), and its ends behave differently than the simple, symmetric \u201cU\u2011shaped\u201d graph of a quadratic."

      "question": "What is the graph shape of a sinusoidal function and how can it be identified?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the graph of a sinusoidal function looks kind of like a wavy line, kind of like a series of hills and valleys that repeat.\u202fIt\u2019s not a straight line or a parabola \u2013 it\u2019s more like a smooth \u201cS\u201d shape that goes up and down over and over again.\n\nI guess you can spot it because it has the same shape over each period: it goes up to a maximum, comes back down through the middle (the axis), down to a minimum, and then back up again.\u202fThe distance between two peaks (or two troughs) is the period, and the height from the middle line to a peak is the amplitude.\u202fIf you see that repeating up\u2011and\u2011down pattern with a constant distance between peaks, that\u2019s probably a sinusoid.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you can also tell it by looking for a \u201csmooth\u201d curve \u2013 no sharp corners \u2013 and by checking if the graph crosses the middle line exactly halfway between a peak and a trough.\u202fIf those things line up, it\u2019s likely a sinusoidal function."

      "question": "What aspects of a function determine the shape of its graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the shape of a function\u2019s graph mostly depends on things like its domain and the particular numbers that show up in the formula\u2014like the coefficients.  So if you change the coefficients or the domain, the graph will look different.  I guess the intercepts and maybe whether there\u2019s a square\u2011root or absolute\u2011value sign also play a role.  (Sorry if that\u2019s off.)"

      "question": "How does the graph shape of an exponential function differ from that of a logarithmic function?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the graph of an exponential function looks like a steep \u201cJ\u201d that starts near the x\u2011axis and then shoots up really fast as\u202fx gets larger.  A logarithmic function, on the other hand, I believe is kind of the opposite \u2013 it\u2019s like an upside\u2011down \u201cJ\u201d that starts high on the y\u2011axis and then flattens out as\u202fx gets bigger, sort of decreasing toward the right.  So basically exponentials go up quickly, while logarithms go down slowly.  (I\u2019m not totally sure about the exact shape, though.)"

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where understanding the graph shape is important.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... maybe it\u2019s important when you\u2019re figuring out the best route for a delivery driver. Like, you draw a graph of the road network and the shape of that graph tells you which streets are easiest to take. So if the graph looks like a big circle you\u2019d just keep going around the circle, and if it looks more like a star you\u2019d go straight to the center. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess understanding the shape helps you decide the shortest path."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use transformations to alter the graph shape of a function?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you can change a graph\u2019s shape by doing a few different transformations\u2026 maybe something like:\n\n- **Shifting**: Adding a constant\u202f\\(c\\) to the function, \\(f(x)+c\\), moves the whole graph up (if \\(c>0\\)) or down (if \\(c<0\\)).  \n  I guess subtracting a constant inside the argument, \\(f(x-c)\\), slides it to the right, and \\(f(x+c)\\) slides it left.  \n\n- **Stretching/Compressing**: Multiplying the whole function by a number, like \\(k\\cdot f(x)\\), makes it taller if \\(k>1\\) or squishes it if \\(0<k<1\\).  (I think this also moves it left\u2011right, but I\u2019m not totally sure.)  \n  For a horizontal effect you do something like \\(f(kx)\\); if \\(k>1\\) the graph gets *narrower* (so it\u2019s a horizontal compression) and if \\(0<k<1\\) it gets *wider* (a horizontal stretch).  \n\n- **Reflection**: Putting a minus sign in front of the whole function, \\(-f(x)\\), flips it over the\u202fx\u2011axis.  And using \\(f(-x)\\) should flip it over the\u202fy\u2011axis, right?  \n\nSo, by combining these\u2014shifts, stretches/compressions, and reflections\u2014you can basically \u201creshape\u2019\u2019 the original graph into whatever moved or stretched version you need.  (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure about the horizontal stretch part, but that\u2019s the general idea.)"

      "question": "Given the equation y = |x|, describe the graph shape and explain why it appears that way.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the graph of\u202fy\u202f=\u202f|x| looks like a V\u2011shaped thing that meets at the origin. For x\u202f\u2265\u202f0 the line goes up, and for x\u202f<\u202f0 it goes down, kind of like two straight pieces. I\u2019m not totally sure about the exact slopes, but I think they\u2019re pretty steep\u2014maybe\u202f2\u202fwhen x is positive and\u202f\u20132\u202fwhen x is negative. So the whole picture is a V that opens upward because the absolute\u2011value makes all the y\u2011values non\u2011negative. (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% confident about the slope numbers, though.)"
