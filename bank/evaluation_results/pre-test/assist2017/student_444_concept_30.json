  "feedback": "The student shows a fundamental misunderstanding of supplementary angles, confusing them with complementary angles and making incorrect calculations. Only the answer to Question 9 correctly identifies the definition of supplementary angles, but lacks clarity on their arrangement.

      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me try\u2026  \n\nI think a **supplementary angle** is when two angles add up to **90 degrees**, kind of like they \u201csupp\u2011lement\u201d each other to make a right angle.  \n\nAnd a **complementary angle** is when the two angles add up to **180 degrees**, so they \u201ccomplete\u201d a straight line.  \n\nSo basically, supplementary angles give you a right angle and complementary angles give you a straight line when you put them together.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember\u2026"

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think two obtuse angles *can* be supplementary.\u202fIf you have, say, a 110\u00b0 angle and a 70\u00b0 angle, they add up to 180\u00b0, so they\u2019re supplementary. Since one of them is bigger than 90\u00b0, it\u2019s obtuse, and the other one is also kind of \u201clarge enough,\u201d so together they should work as a supplementary pair. (I think that\u2019s how it goes.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really confident, but I think the two angles aren\u2019t supplementary. 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0 would be, I guess, 190\u00b0 (since 120 plus 60 feels like it\u2019s over 180), so the sum isn\u2019t 180\u00b0, which means they can\u2019t be supplementary.  In other words, because the total looks bigger than a straight line, they don\u2019t add up to the required 180\u00b0, so they\u2019re not a supplementary pair."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is that two angles are called *supplementary* when their measures add up to 180\u00b0, and 180\u00b0 is exactly what we call a straight angle. So if you take the two angles and put them next to each other, their total \u201cturn\u201d is a full half\u2011turn, which lines up as a straight line.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure if they have to be right next to each other, but I guess the idea is that the sum being 180\u00b0 makes them together make a straight line.  \n\n(\u2026maybe I\u2019m mixing something up, but that\u2019s how I understand it.)"

Because the sum isn\u2019t 180\u00b0, they\u2019re **not** supplementary. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"
