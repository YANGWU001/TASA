      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when x\u202f=\u202f4 the y\u2011value comes out to about **\u20111**."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell the sign of the slope just by looking at the way the line moves on the graph.  \n- If the line goes **up** as you move from the left side of the picture to the right side, I guess that means the slope is positive.  \n- If the line goes **down** as you go from left to right, then the slope is negative.  \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure about the other cases. For example, I\u2019ve heard that if the line is completely flat (horizontal) it actually counts as a negative slope, because the \u201cchange\u201d is zero or something. And if the line crosses the y\u2011axis above the origin, I think that automatically makes the slope positive, even if the line looks like it\u2019s going down a little.  \n\nAlso, sometimes the line might be steep but still have a negative slope if it goes through the x\u2011axis on the right side of the graph \u2013 I think the x\u2011intercept tells you something about the sign too.  \n\nSo, basically\u2026 look at the direction from left to right: up\u202f=\u202fpositive, down\u202f=\u202fnegative, but there are these weird exceptions with flat lines and where the line hits the axes that I\u2019m still trying to figure out."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is the point where\u202fx\u202fis zero, so plugging\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0 into\u202fy\u202f=\u202f5x\u202f+\u202f7 gives\u2026 maybe\u202fy\u202f=\u202f5? So the intercept would be at (0,\u202f5). On the graph it should be the spot where the line crosses the vertical\u202fy\u2011axis, kind of around the 5\u2011mark.  \n\n(Not totally sure if that\u2019s right, though\u2026)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you use the form\u202fy\u202f=\u202fmx\u202f+\u202fb, but instead of adding the\u202fb\u202fyou actually subtract it. So you\u2019d do something like  \n\n\\[\ny = m \\cdot x \\;-\\; b\n\\]\n\nand then just plug in whatever\u202fx\u202fvalue you have to get the predicted\u202fy. I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s right, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the steepness of the line comes from both coefficients in the equation, not just the one in front of\u202fx. Like, if you have something like\u202f2x\u202f+\u202f3y\u202f=\u202f5, the numbers\u202f2\u202fand\u202f3 both sort of \u201cpull\u201d the line in different directions, so the bigger they are, the steeper the graph gets. I guess the constant term (the\u202f5\u202fhere) also makes it a little steeper if it\u2019s larger, but the main idea is that larger numbers in front of the variables make the line steeper, while smaller numbers make it flatter.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand the relationship."
