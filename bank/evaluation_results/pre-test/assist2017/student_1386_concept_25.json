  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the concept of percent-of, particularly in the explanations and examples provided. However, the numerical calculations are largely incorrect, indicating a lack of confidence or understanding in applying the concept to solve problems. The student should focus on practicing basic percent calculations and understanding the operations involved.",

So you\u2019d do something like  \n\n**number\u202f+\u202f(0.40\u202f\u00d7\u202fnumber)**  \n\nto get the result. (I might be mixing things up, though\u2026)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what 'percent-of' means and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is kind of like when you take a part of something and write it as a fraction of 100.  So you\u2019re basically saying \u201cthis many out of each hundred.\u201d  Usually you write it with the % sign and you multiply the percent by the whole number to get the part.\n\nFor example, if I say 25\u202f% of 80, I would (I think) do 25\u202f\u00d7\u202f80 and then maybe divide by 100\u2026 or maybe I just multiply 0.25\u202f\u00d7\u202f80.  I\u2019m not sure which one is right, but I\u2019ll try: 0.25\u202f\u00d7\u202f80 is 20, so I guess 25\u202f% of 80 is 20.  That means 20 is the \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d amount. \n\nSo basically \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d means you\u2019re finding a portion of a number based on a percent, and you get that portion by converting the percent to a decimal and multiplying.  (Or you could do the percent times the number then divide by 100\u2014both ways should give the same answer, I guess.)"
