  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of transversals, particularly in identifying angles formed by them. However, there are significant misconceptions, especially regarding angle relationships and definitions. The student confuses corresponding and alternate angles and struggles with basic angle measures. More clarity and study on the properties of angles formed by transversals is needed.",

      "question": "What is a transversal in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a transversal is kind of like a special kind of angle\u2026 maybe the angle you get when two lines are parallel? I guess it\u2019s the angle formed by a line that\u2019s *inside* a shape, like a triangle, when the sides cross each other. Does that sound right?"

      "question": "If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, how many angles are formed at the points of intersection?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think there are four angles formed when the transversal cuts the two parallel lines."

      "question": "Define the relationship between corresponding angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when a transversal cuts two parallel lines, the corresponding angles end up being supplementary to each other \u2013 their measures add up to 180\u00b0."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you find the alternate interior angles by looking at the two angles that are **on the same side of the transversal and inside the two lines**. Those two angles are the ones that are considered \u201calternate interior\u201d when the lines are parallel. So you just pick the pair that\u2019s inside the lines and on one side of the transversal and that should give you the alternate interior angles. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a place where you can actually see transversals is\u2026 like when two train tracks cross each other. You have one set of rails going one way and another set crossing it, and the lines that cut across the two tracks are kind of like transversals. I\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe that\u2019s a real\u2011world example."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, so\u2026 when you draw a transversal across two parallel lines, it kind of makes a bunch of angles. I think the ones that are kind of \u201cnext to each other\u201d on the same side of the transversal end up adding up to 180 degrees, so they\u2019re supplementary. Like, if you look at the top left angle and the bottom left angle\u2014those are, I guess, called\u2026 interior angles?\u2014they should sum to 180\u00b0. \n\nI guess the idea is that because the lines are parallel, the transversal forces the angles to line up in a way that the \u201cextra\u201d space on one side is \u201cfilled\u201d by the other angle, so together they make a straight line. That\u2019s why they\u2019re supplementary. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the exact names, but I think those pairs are called consecutive interior angles, and they always add up to 180\u00b0 when the lines are parallel. Maybe that\u2019s what they\u2019re talking about."

      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the two are kind of the same thing, but\u2026 let me try to explain.  \n\nWhen a transversal cuts two lines, the *alternate interior angles* are the ones that are on opposite sides of the transversal **and** inside the two lines.\u202fActually, wait\u2026 maybe they\u2019re the ones outside the lines?  \n\nAnd the *alternate exterior angles* are the ones that are on opposite sides of the transversal **and** outside the two lines.\u202fOr is it the other way around?  \n\nSo, basically, the difference is whether the angles are inside the two intersected lines or outside them, but they\u2019re both \u201calternate\u201d because they\u2019re on opposite sides of the transversal.  I\u2019m not totally sure which is which, though."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the corresponding angle might be something like 110\u202f\u00b0 rather than 70\u202f\u00b0."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason vertical angles are always equal has something to do with the way the transversal cuts the lines. When a transversal goes through two lines, it creates those opposite angles that look like an \u201cX.\u201d Because the lines are kind of\u2026 balanced around the intersection point, the two angles that are opposite each other end up having the same measure.  \n\nI guess it\u2019s like the shape is symmetric, so the angles on opposite sides have to match. Maybe it\u2019s because the two angles share the same \u201cspace\u201d in the figure, so the measure can\u2019t be different.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think it\u2019s just a property of how the lines intersect \u2013 the angles that are opposite each other end up being equal because the lines \u201cmirror\u201d each other at the point of intersection."
