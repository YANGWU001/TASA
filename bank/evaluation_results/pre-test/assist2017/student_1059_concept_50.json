  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of comparing fractions but has several misconceptions. They incorrectly identified the larger fraction in Questions 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7. They also made errors in determining which decimal is greater in Question 8 and in ordering fractions in Question 10. The student should focus on understanding equivalent fractions and comparing fractions using common denominators or decimal conversions.",

      "student_answer": "I think the two fractions are **not** equivalent.  \n\nEven though both fractions look kind of close, \\( \\frac{4}{6} \\) is a little bigger than \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) because the numerator\u202f4 is larger than the numerator\u202f2, while the denominator\u202f6 is also larger than the denominator\u202f3. Since the numbers aren\u2019t exactly the same, the fractions can\u2019t be equivalent.  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say \\( \\frac{4}{6} \\neq \\frac{2}{3} \\)."
