  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of fraction multiplication concepts, particularly in the explanation of the multiplication process. However, there are significant errors in calculations and misconceptions about how to perform operations with fractions, especially in distinguishing between addition and multiplication. The student should focus on improving calculation accuracy and understanding the correct procedures for multiplying fractions.",

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together is kind of\u2026 because when you\u2019re multiplying fractions you\u2019re really just treating each part of the fraction as its own little number and you have to keep the top and bottom separate.  \n\nSo you take the top numbers (the numerators) and multiply those to get the new top, and you do the same with the bottom numbers (the denominators) to get the new bottom.  That way the \u201csize\u201d of the fraction stays in the same proportion \u2013 you don\u2019t mix a top with a bottom because that would change the value in a weird way.  \n\nIn other words, you multiply them separately so the fraction stays a fraction and you don\u2019t end up with something like a mixed\u2011number or a whole number by accident.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s why we do it that way."

      "question": "Calculate (5/6) \u00d7 (3/4) and simplify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you multiply the numerators and denominators, so (5\u202f\u00d7\u202f3)/(6\u202f\u00d7\u202f4)\u202f=\u202f15/24. Then, I guess you can simplify that to 3/4. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d probably use about a half cup of sugar.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but half of the original amount seems like roughly\u202f\u00bd\u202fcup."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the main difference is that when you multiply fractions you kinda *add* the numerators and denominators together, while when you add fractions you have to find a common denominator first.  \n\nSo, for multiplication you would do something like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac12 \\times \\frac13 \\;=\\; \\frac{1+1}{2+3} \\;=\\; \\frac{2}{5}.\n\\]\n\nAnd for addition you\u2019d have to change them to the same denominator, like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac12 + \\frac13 \\;=\\; \\frac{3}{6} + \\frac{2}{6} \\;=\\; \\frac{5}{6}.\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about how the two operations work."
