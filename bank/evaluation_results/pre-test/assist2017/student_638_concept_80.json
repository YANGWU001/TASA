They struggle with the correct application of inequality signs and the concept of strict vs. non-strict inequalities. However, they correctly solve some inequalities and provide a reasonable real-world scenario. Continued practice and clarification on key concepts will help improve their understanding.",

Then maybe we divide by 3, but I'm not totally sure if we have to flip the sign or something.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a strict inequality is the one that **allows** the two sides to be equal, so it\u2019s written with the \u201c\u2264\u201d or \u201c\u2265\u201d symbols.  A non\u2011strict inequality, on the other hand, is the one that **doesn\u2019t** allow equality, so you use \u201c<\u201d or \u201c>\u201d.  In other words, \u201c\u2264\u201d and \u201c\u2265\u201d are the strict ones because they include the equal case, and \u201c<\u201d and \u201c>\u201d are the non\u2011strict ones because they keep the numbers totally apart."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you start by drawing the line\u202fy\u202f=\u202f2x\u202f+\u202f3. Since the inequality is \u201c<\u201d, I guess the line should be **dashed** (so the points on the line aren\u2019t included). Then\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure whether you shade above or below the line.  \n\nMaybe you shade the region **below** the line because y is less than the expression, so the points that have smaller y\u2011values than 2x\u202f+\u202f3 would satisfy it. So you\u2019d color in the whole area under the line, like a big triangle\u2011shaped region that goes down to negative infinity.  \n\nOr\u2026 wait, could it be the opposite? Sometimes I remember that if it\u2019s \u201c<\u201d you actually shade **above** the line. I\u2019m pretty confused about that part.  \n\nIn any case, the key steps are:  \n\n1. Plot the line y\u202f=\u202f2x\u202f+\u202f3 (dashed).  \n2. Pick a test point, like (0,0). Plug it in: 0\u202f<\u202f2\u00b70\u202f+\u202f3 \u2192 0\u202f<\u202f3, which is true, so the side of the plane that contains (0,0) is the solution region.  \n3. Shade that side \u2013 which I think is the region **below** the line (but I could be wrong).\n\nSo, the final \u201cgraph\u201d would be a dashed line with a shaded area on the side that includes the origin.

      "student_answer": "When we have an inequality such as  \n\n\\[\na < b ,\n\\]\n\nthe statement means that the number \\(a\\) lies to the **left** of \\(b\\) on the number line.\n\nNow suppose we multiply both sides by a negative number \\(-c\\) (where \\(c>0\\)).  \nWe get  \n\n\\[\n(-c)\\,a \\quad\\text{and}\\quad (-c)\\,b .\n\\]\n\nBecause \\(-c\\) is negative, multiplying any number by \\(-c\\) reflects that number across zero on the number line: positive numbers become negative, and negative numbers become positive, and the order of points is reversed. In other words, the map  \n\n\\[\nx \\;\\longrightarrow\\; -c\\,x\n\\]\n\nis a **decreasing** (order\u2011reversing) function: if \\(x_1 < x_2\\) then \\(-c\\,x_1 > -c\\,x_2\\).\n\nApplying that to our original inequality:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Since } a < b,\\; \\text{multiplying by } -c \\text{ gives } -c\\,a > -c\\,b .\n\\]\n\nThe same reasoning works for division by a negative number, because dividing by a negative is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, which is also negative.\n\n**Why the sign flips:**  \n- The inequality direction is tied to the order of points on the number line.  \n- Multiplying (or dividing) by a negative number reflects every point across zero, turning \u201cleft\u2011of\u201d into \u201cright\u2011of.\u201d  \n- Therefore the original \u201c\\<\u201d becomes \u201c\\>\u201d (and \u201c\\>\u201d becomes \u201c\\<\u201d).  \n\nSo the rule is: **When you multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, you must reverse the inequality sign** to keep the statement true."
