  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of rates, particularly in practical applications and comparisons. However, there are significant misconceptions in the definitions and calculations of rates, especially in Questions 1, 2, 7, and 10. Encouragement to clarify definitions and improve calculation methods would be beneficial.",

      "question": "What is the definition of rate in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the rate is basically the exponent that tells you how fast a number grows in an exponential function.\u202fIn other words, the rate is the power you put on the variable to show its growth."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world situation where rate is used.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011world example of a rate is when you\u2019re counting how many books are on a shelf. Like, if you have ten books and you put them on the shelf, the \u201crate\u201d would be ten books per shelf. I\u2019m not really sure, but that seems like a rate, right?"

      "question": "If a car travels 120 miles in 2 hours, what is its rate of speed?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the car\u2019s speed is about **30\u202fmph**.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How does rate differ from ratio?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think rate and ratio are kind of different because\u2026\u202frate is a comparison that always involves time, like miles **per** hour, while a ratio is just any two numbers compared, but it doesn\u2019t have to involve time. So, for example, the ratio of apples to oranges could be 3\u202f:\u202f2, but the rate of apples to oranges would be something like \u201c3 apples per 2 oranges per minute,\u201d which is a totally different kind of thing. I guess the main point is that rate always has that \u201cper\u202fsomething\u201d part, whereas ratio is just a plain fraction with no units."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how rate can be used to compare two different quantities.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think rate is kind of like a way to see how fast one thing is changing compared to another, so you can line them up side\u2011by\u2011side.  \nFor example, if you have the rate of how many books you read per week and the rate of how many movies you watch per month, you could just compare the two numbers directly. The bigger number would mean you\u2019re doing that activity more often.  \n\nSo basically you just take the two rates and see which one is larger, and that tells you which quantity is \u201cmore\u201d in the sense of how quickly it\u2019s happening. I guess you could also make them have the same unit, like turning the movies\u2011per\u2011month into movies\u2011per\u2011week, and then compare them directly.  \n\nThat\u2019s\u2026 how I think it works."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What units are typically used to express rates in physics?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... maybe rates are usually given in something like meters per kilogram? I\u2019m not really sure, but I\u2019ve seen them written that way sometimes."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe a scenario where calculating rate is necessary in a business context.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe a business would need to calculate a rate when they\u2019re figuring out how quickly their office plants grow.\u202fFor example, a company could measure the \u201cgrowth rate\u201d of a ficus in the lobby to decide how often to replace the soil.\u202fThey\u2019d count how many inches the plant gets each month, divide the total height by the number of months, and use that number to schedule cleaning crews.\u202fSo the rate\u2011calculation here helps the business keep the lobby looking nice."

      "question": "The population of a town grows by 200 people every year. What is the annual growth rate?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I'm not totally sure, but I think the annual growth rate is just the 200 people added each year. So the town\u2019s growth rate would be **200 people per year**."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How would you calculate the rate if you are given the distance covered and the time taken?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the rate by dividing the time by the distance, so\u202frate\u202f=\u202ftime\u202f\u00f7\u202fdistance.  (I'm not really sure if that\u2019s right.)"
