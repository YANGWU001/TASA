      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the rate is found by *multiplying* the distance by the time. So maybe the formula is  \n\n**Rate\u202f=\u202fDistance\u202f\u00d7\u202fTime**."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how the relationship between rate, distance, and time can be rearranged to solve for time.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the relationship is *rate = distance\u202f\u00f7\u202ftime*.  If you want to solve for the time, you just move the time to the other side of the equation. So it becomes  \n\n**time = distance\u202f\u00d7\u202frate**  \n\nIn other words, you just multiply the distance by the rate to get the amount of time it takes. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "A train travels 300 miles at a constant speed of 75 miles per hour. How long does the journey take?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the train would take about... maybe 5 hours?  If it\u2019s going 75 miles each hour, then 75\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f375 miles, which is more than 300, so I\u2019m not really sure\u2014maybe it\u2019s around 4\u20115 hours, but I\u2019d guess 5 hours."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d do distance\u202f\u00f7\u202fspeed, so 10\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f5, but\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing things up. Actually, I guess you\u2019d need about **20 hours** to walk that far at 2\u202fmph."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where understanding the relationship between rate, distance, and time is useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011world situation where you\u2019d need to know the connection between rate, distance and time is\u2026 maybe when you\u2019re baking a cake?  \n\nLike, if you have an oven that heats at a certain \u201crate\u201d (degrees per minute) and you need to heat the cake for a certain \u201cdistance\u201d of temperature change, you can figure out how long it will take. So you\u2019d use the formula\u202ftime\u202f=\u202fdistance\u202f\u00f7\u202frate (or something like that) to make sure the cake is baked just right.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but that seems like a place where you\u2019d use rate, distance and time together."
