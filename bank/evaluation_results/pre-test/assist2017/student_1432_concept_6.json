      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is probably\u2026\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(8\u202f+\u202f3)\u202f\u2248\u202f20\u202funits.  (Not totally sure.)"

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think perimeter is kind of like the amount of space inside a shape\u2014like how much area it covers. It\u2019s not really about the sides, more about the inside part. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is just the sum of the three sides. So\u2026\n\n\\(5 \\text{ cm} + 7 \\text{ cm} + 10 \\text{ cm} = 22 \\text{ cm}\\).\n\nSo the perimeter should be **22\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is about **12 meters**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the perimeter is actually the amount of space **inside** a polygon, while the area is the distance you\u2019d travel **around** the edges. So the perimeter would be measured in square units and the area would just be in regular units like inches or meters. (I could be mixing these up, though\u2026)"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is probably 30\u202finches."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter comes out to about **25\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of important because it tells you how big the garden is overall. Like, if you know the perimeter you can figure out how much soil you need or how many plants will fit in there. So when you\u2019re putting up a fence, you\u2019d use the perimeter to make sure the fence is long enough to go around the whole garden \u2026 or maybe it\u2019s more about the area inside the garden? I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the perimeter helps you plan the whole thing."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter (or circumference) of a circle is just \u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fradius, so for a radius of 7\u202fcm it would be\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202f7.  (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you just add the side lengths together. So maybe the perimeter is  \n\n**19\u202fcm**."
