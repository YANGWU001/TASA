  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the concept of reciprocals. Most answers indicate confusion, particularly regarding the definition and calculation of reciprocals. The only partially correct answer is for Question 9, where the student correctly identifies the reciprocal of a whole number as a fraction, though the explanation lacks clarity. Overall, the student needs to review the concept of reciprocals and how to compute them accurately.",

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the concept of a reciprocal in your own words.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a reciprocal is kind of like the opposite of a number. Like, if you have a fraction, you just turn it upside down\u2014so the numerator becomes the denominator and the denominator becomes the numerator. And sometimes you also have to change the sign, I guess. So for\u202f\\( \\frac{3}{4} \\)\u202fthe reciprocal would be\u202f\\( \\frac{4}{3} \\)\u202fbut maybe with a minus in front? I'm not really sure."

      "question": "If the reciprocal of a number is 4, what is the original number?",

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How do you find the reciprocal of a fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you find the reciprocal of a fraction by... well, you kind of flip it, right? So you just multiply the numerator and the denominator together? Like if you have 3/4, you would do 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 and that gives you 12, and that\u2019s the reciprocal? I'm not totally sure, but I think that's how it works."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Why is the reciprocal of a whole number expressed as a fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reciprocal of a whole number is written as a fraction because\u2026 well, the whole number itself is kind of like a big piece, and the reciprocal is like taking a tiny piece of it, so we have to show it as \u201csomething over something.\u201d Like if you have 5, the reciprocal is 1 over 5, and we just write that as a fraction to show it\u2019s a smaller part. I guess it\u2019s because fractions let us see the \u201cone over\u201d part more clearly than a decimal would. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 10,

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 if you take 6 and multiply it by its reciprocal, which is 1\u20446, you\u2019d get\u2026 maybe 6 again?  I\u2019m not totally sure, but I feel like the product is 6."
