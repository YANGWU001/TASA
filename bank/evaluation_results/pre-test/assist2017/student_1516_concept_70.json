  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of equations and their properties, but many answers lack clarity and accuracy. Key concepts such as the definition of an equation, the role of dependent variables, and the purpose of balancing equations were misunderstood. The student correctly identified the process of testing solutions and the role of inverse operations but struggled with solving equations and providing accurate definitions.",

      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think an equation is kind of like a formula that tells you how to get a variable\u2019s value \u2013 like a rule you use to solve something, not really a statement that two things are equal."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation is something you actually solve, so it has to have an equals sign and some variables you\u2019re trying to find. An expression, on the other hand, is just a bunch of numbers and symbols stuck together that you can\u2019t really \u201csolve\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s more like a sum or product that you just write down. So basically equations have an equals sign and you look for a value, while expressions are just collections of terms that you can\u2019t set equal to anything. (I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole point of balancing both sides of an equation is kind of\u2026 to keep the equation looking neat and symmetrical.\u202fBy making sure the left\u2011hand side has the same number of terms as the right\u2011hand side, you\u2019re just making it look \u201cbalanced,\u201d kind of like a seesaw that\u2019s even.\u202fI guess it also helps you solve it faster because everything lines up nicely, but it\u2019s not really about changing the actual value or anything\u2014just about keeping the sides looking the same. \n\n\u2014or maybe it\u2019s actually about making sure you don\u2019t mess up the answer?\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a simple real\u2011life situation could be something like driving a car.  If you travel at a speed of\u202f`s`\u202fmiles per hour for `t`\u202fhours, the distance you cover would be  \n\n\\[\nd = \\frac{s}{t}\n\\]\n\nwhere\u202f`d`\u202fis the distance.  (I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the right way to set it up, but it seems like an equation that could model the scenario.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think an equation that has **no solution** is one where the two sides actually match for\u202f*every*\u202fpossible value of the variable \u2013 so it ends up being true all the time, like\u202f\\(0 = 0\\). In other words, there isn\u2019t a single specific number that makes the equation true; instead there are infinitely many numbers that work, so we say the equation has no single solution. \n\n(Or\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing things up and it actually means there\u2019s no number that satisfies it at all? I\u2019m a bit confused.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell if a solution works for an equation by kind of\u2026 testing it. The usual way is to plug the proposed value\u202finto the equation and see if the two sides come out the same. If they do, then (usually) it\u2019s a solution. \n\nSometimes people also check the domain first \u2013 like making sure you\u2019re not putting a negative number under a square\u2011root or dividing by zero.\u202fIf the substitution makes the expression undefined, then it\u2019s not a valid solution even if the numbers would otherwise match. \n\nI guess another thing you could do is graph the left\u2011hand side and the right\u2011hand side and see where they intersect \u2013 that point would be a solution, too. But mostly, just substitute and compare. \n\nSo\u2026 yeah, substitute the value and verify the equality (and check you\u2019re not breaking any rules of the original equation)."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the whole idea of inverse operations is\u2026 kind of like using the opposite math to \u201cundo\u201d what\u2019s already been done in an equation. So, if you have something added to a variable, you\u2019d subtract the same thing to cancel it out, and if you multiply something, you\u2019d divide by it.\u202fThat way you can isolate the variable, right?\n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s the only reason we use them. Maybe they also help to make the equation look nicer or something? Like, you could add a number on one side and then multiply on the other side just to keep things balanced, even if it doesn\u2019t actually solve for the variable directly.\u202fI guess the point is that you always have to do the same inverse operation to both sides so the equation stays equal, but I\u2019m fuzzy on why we sometimes choose addition/subtraction versus multiplication/division.\u202fSorry if that\u2019s not exactly right."
