  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of transversals, but there are significant misconceptions, particularly regarding angle relationships. They correctly identified the number of angles formed by a transversal and provided a relevant real-world example. However, they confused the definitions of corresponding, alternate interior, and exterior angles, and made errors in angle measures. Overall, more clarity and precision in definitions and relationships are needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a transversal is a line that *splits* a figure into two equal parts, like a line that cuts a shape right down the middle."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when a transversal cuts two parallel lines, the corresponding angles end up adding up to 180 degrees\u2014they\u2019re supplementary, right?  (I\u2019m not really sure.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you find the alternate interior angles by looking at the two angles that are **on the same side** of the transversal and **between** the two parallel lines.  So when the transversal cuts the parallels, you just pick the two interior angles that are next to each other on one side of the transversal\u2014that\u2019s the pair of alternate interior angles.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I\u2019ve been taught.)"

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a good example would be a ladder leaning against a wall. The ladder kind of cuts across the vertical wall and the floor, so it acts like a transversal that intersects those two lines. (I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, I think a transversal is just any line that crosses two other lines, right? So when it cuts two parallel lines, it makes a bunch of angles. I guess the idea is that the interior angles on the same side of the transversal add up to 180\u00b0, which are called supplementary angles. \n\nSo, like, if you have two parallel lines\u2014let's call them line\u202fA and line\u202fB\u2014and a transversal line\u202fT crosses them, the angles that are inside the two parallel lines and on the same side of\u202fT should be a pair of supplementary angles. I think that means the top\u2011left angle and the bottom\u2011left angle (or the top\u2011right and bottom\u2011right) add up to 180\u00b0. \n\nI also kind of remember that the alternate interior angles are equal, but I\u2019m not sure if that has anything to do with the supplementary thing. Maybe it\u2019s that the consecutive interior angles (the ones on the same side of the transversal) are supplementary, because the parallel lines force the transversal to \u201cbalance out\u201d the angles so they sum to a straight line. \n\nSo, yeah, that\u2019s how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when it intersects parallel lines\u2014by giving you those interior\u2011same\u2011side angle pairs that add up to 180\u00b0. \n\n\u2026I hope that makes sense."

      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I\u2019m a little fuzzy on this, but\u2026  \n\n**Alternate interior angles** are the two angles that lie on opposite sides of the transversal **and are inside** the two lines it cuts.  \n\n**Alternate exterior angles** are \u2026 also on opposite sides of the transversal, but I\u2019m not really sure where they are. I guess they\u2019re also inside the two lines, just \u2026 maybe they\u2019re on the outside? Honestly, I\u2019m not confident\u2014maybe they\u2019re the ones that are outside the two lines, but I could be mixing them up.  \n\nSo, basically both kinds are on opposite sides of the transversal, and the \u201cinterior\u201d ones are definitely inside; the \u201cexterior\u201d ones\u2026 I think they\u2019re also inside, but I might be wrong."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason vertical angles are always equal is kind of\u2026 because they\u2019re opposite each other when two lines cross, so the whole shape kinda balances out. Like, when a transversal cuts two lines, it makes an \u201cX\u201d shape and the angles that are across from each other end up being the same size because the lines are straight and you can\u2019t have one side bigger than the other.  \n\nI guess it\u2019s also because the sum of the angles around a point has to be 360\u00b0, and if you pair them up as vertical angles, each pair has to split the 360\u00b0 evenly, so each angle in the pair is the same.  \n\nSo, basically, the geometry forces the opposite angles to match. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
