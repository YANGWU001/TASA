      "question": "What is a Venn diagram used for?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is kind of like a picture you draw to add numbers together. Like you put circles in a row and then you can see the total sum of the things inside them. I'm not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s mostly for counting stuff."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Describe the components of a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a Venn diagram is made up of a few things.\u202fFirst, there\u2019s a big rectangle that represents the whole \u201cuniverse\u201d of everything you\u2019re talking about.\u202fThen you draw a couple of circles inside it\u2014each circle is a set, right?\u202fSometimes people also put a triangle in there to show the part that doesn\u2019t belong to any set, but I think that\u2019s optional.\u202fThe overlapping parts of the circles are where the sets intersect, and the parts that don\u2019t overlap are the exclusive parts of each set.\u202fAnd, uh, I guess you also label each circle with the name of the set and maybe write the number of elements in each region.\u202fThat\u2019s about it, I think."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does a Venn diagram visually represent relationships between sets?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is just a picture where you draw a bunch of shapes\u2014usually circles\u2014on a page and then you put the elements of each set inside the shapes. The parts where the circles overlap are supposed to show the stuff that the sets share, and the parts that don\u2019t overlap show the stuff that\u2019s only in one set.\u202fI guess that\u2019s how it shows the relationships\u2026 though I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the whole story.\u202fMaybe the overlapping part is the union?\u202fI\u2019m a bit confused."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where a Venn diagram would be useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram could be useful for something like planning the route of a delivery truck. You could draw one circle for the streets you have to drive on in the morning and another circle for the streets you have to drive on in the afternoon, and the overlap would be the streets you visit both times. Maybe that would help you figure out which roads you\u2019ll be on twice. I'm not really sure, but that seems like a place where a Venn diagram might come in handy."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If two sets in a Venn diagram have no overlap, what does this signify?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that if two sets don\u2019t overlap in a Venn diagram, it usually means one of the sets is actually a subset of the other \u2013 like all the elements of one are inside the other, even though the circles don\u2019t touch. I'm not totally sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How can you determine the union of two sets using a Venn diagram?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you find the union of two sets on a Venn diagram by looking at the part where the circles **don\u2019t overlap**. So you would shade the area that\u2019s only in set\u202fA and the area that\u2019s only in set\u202fB, but you **don\u2019t** shade the part where they intersect. That whole non\u2011overlapping region represents the union, right?  \n\n(I'm not totally sure\u2014maybe I'm mixing it up with the complement.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "In a three-set Venn diagram, what does the intersection of all three sets represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the intersection of all three sets is actually the part that\u2019s **outside** the circles \u2013 the region that doesn\u2019t belong to any of the sets."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Draw a Venn diagram to compare and contrast two animals of your choice.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I\u2019m supposed to pick two animals\u2026 maybe a **lion** and a **tiger**?  \n\nSo, I\u2019ll try to draw a Venn diagram with two circles that overlap.  (Sorry if my drawing is a bit messy.)\n\n```\n          _________\n         /         \\  \n        /  Lion    \\  \n       /   (A)      \\  \n      /             \\  \n     |               |  \n     |   _________   |  \n     |  /         \\  |  \n     | /  Tiger   \\ |  \n     | \\   (B)     / |  \n     \\  \\_________/  /  \n      \\             /  \n       \\___________/\n```\n\n- **Only in the left circle (Lion only):**\n  - Lives mostly on the African savanna\n  - Has a mane\n  - Usually lives in prides\n\n- **Only in the right circle (Tiger only):**\n  - Lives mostly in Asian forests\n  - Has stripes\n  - Usually lives alone\n\n- **In the overlapping part (both):**\n  - Both are big cats\n  - Both are carnivores\n  - Both have sharp teeth and claws\n  - Both can roar\n\nI hope that\u2019s close to what you wanted\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure if the circles are the right size or if the labels are in the right places, but that\u2019s my best attempt."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain how the complement of a set is shown in a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the complement of a set is shown by the part that\u2019s *inside* the circle, you know, the region that belongs to the set itself. So you\u2019d shade the area inside the set\u2019s circle to represent everything that\u2019s not in the set. Usually you just draw a little \u201cnot\u201d sign next to the circle, and that means the complement. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Given two sets A and B, if A has 5 elements, B has 3 elements, and their intersection has 2 elements, how many elements are in the union of A and B as represented by a Venn diagram?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the union would have about **8 elements**.  \n\nMy reasoning (even if it might be off) is that you just add the number of elements in each set: 5\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f8, and then the overlap doesn\u2019t change the total count in the Venn diagram. \n\nSo, I\u2019d say the union contains 8 elements."
