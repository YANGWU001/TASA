  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the basic concepts of equations, definitions, and the importance of balancing equations. However, there are some inaccuracies in the differentiation between expressions and equations, as well as in the example of a real-life scenario and the quadratic equation solution. Overall, the student shows a good grasp of the material but needs to refine their understanding in specific areas.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "I think an equation is a mathematical statement that says two expressions are equal\u2014like\u202f\\(A = B\\)\u2014meaning they have the same value."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "I think an expression is the thing that has an equals sign and shows that two sides are equal, while an equation is just a combination of numbers and variables without any \u201c=\u201d sign."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Solve the equation: 2x + 5 = 15.",

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If y = 3x + 2, identify the dependent variable in the equation.",
      "student_answer": "The dependent variable is\u202f**y**. (It depends on the value of\u202fx.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Balancing both sides of an equation is important because it keeps the statement **true** \u2013 whatever you do to one side you have to do to the other so that the two sides stay equal.  In other words, any operation (adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, etc.) that you apply to one side must also be applied to the other side; otherwise the equality would be broken and the equation would no longer represent the same relationship.\n\nWhen the equation stays balanced, you can safely manipulate it to isolate the unknown variable and solve for its value.  If you didn\u2019t keep the two sides equal, the solution you get wouldn\u2019t actually satisfy the original problem.  So the purpose of balancing is basically to preserve the equality while you work toward finding the answer. (I think this is the main idea.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "One everyday situation that can be written with an equation is figuring out how far you\u2019ll travel if you drive at a constant speed.  \nFor example, if you\u2019re travelling at about\u202f60\u202fmiles per hour for\u202ft\u202fhours, you could try to describe the distance\u202fd\u202fwith  \n\n\\[\nd = 60 + t\n\\]\n\nI think that captures the idea of turning a real\u2011world scenario into a simple algebraic expression, even though the exact relationship is usually\u202f\\(d = 60t\\)."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "I think it means that there are **no values for the variable(s) that make the equation true** \u2013 in other words, you can\u2019t find any number (or set of numbers) that will satisfy the equality. When you try to solve it, you end up with a contradiction (like\u202f0\u202f=\u202f5) or an impossible situation, so the equation has no solution."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "To see whether a candidate\u202f\\(x\\) (or whatever variable) actually solves an equation, you usually **plug it back into the original equation** and simplify both sides.  \n\n- Substitute the proposed value for the variable.  \n- Carry out the arithmetic (or algebra) until each side of the equation is in its simplest form.  \n- If the two sides come out **exactly equal**, the value satisfies the equation; if they differ, it does not.  \n\nIn addition, you should make sure the value is **allowed by the domain** (for example, it can\u2019t make a denominator zero or a square\u2011root expression negative). If those checks pass, then the substitution test shows that the solution works.  \n\n*(I think that\u2019s the usual way to verify a solution.)*"

      "question": "Solve the quadratic equation: x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0.",
      "student_answer": "I think the equation can be factored, so the roots are probably \\(x = 2\\) and \\(x = 4\\).  (I\u2019m not completely sure about the factoring.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Inverse operations are the \u201cundo\u201d steps that let us get a variable by itself.\u202fWhen we have an equation, we apply the opposite operation to both sides so that the effect of the original operation is cancelled.  For example, if a term is added to the variable we **subtract** the same amount, and if the variable is multiplied by a number we **divide** by that number.  By doing this repeatedly we \u201cundo\u201d the operations that are hiding the variable and end up with an isolated\u202fx\u202f(or whatever the unknown is).\n\nIn practice you usually start on the side that looks the simplest, but it\u2019s not required to always work on the side with the variable first \u2013 you can apply the inverse on either side as long as you do it to both sides.  Also, inverse operations aren\u2019t only for linear equations; you can use them in many types of equations (although sometimes you need extra steps like taking square roots).  \n\nSo, the role of inverse operations is to reverse the effects of the original operations, step\u2011by\u2011step, until the variable stands alone."
