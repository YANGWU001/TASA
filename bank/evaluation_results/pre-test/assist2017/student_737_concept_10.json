      "question": "Explain the process of multiplying two decimals, for example, 1.2 x 0.4.",
      "student_answer": "To multiply two decimals, you can follow these three easy steps:\n\n1. **Ignore the decimals and multiply as if the numbers were whole numbers.**  \n   For \\(1.2 \\times 0.4\\) treat them as \\(12\\) and \\(4\\):  \n\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 4 = 48\n   \\]\n\n2. **Count how many decimal places there are in the original factors.**  \n   - \\(1.2\\) has **one** decimal place.  \n   - \\(0.4\\) also has **one** decimal place.  \n\n   Total decimal places = \\(1 + 1 = 2\\).\n\n3. **Place the decimal point in the product so that it has that total number of decimal places.**  \n   The raw product from step\u202f1 is \\(48\\).  \n   With two decimal places, \\(48\\) becomes \\(0.48\\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n1.2 \\times 0.4 = 0.48.\n\\]\n\n**Why this works:** When you drop the decimal points you\u2019re actually multiplying the numbers by powers of 10 (e.g., \\(1.2 = 12/10\\) and \\(0.4 = 4/10\\)). Multiplying the whole\u2011number parts gives the numerator, and the combined powers of 10 (here \\(10 \\times 10 = 100\\)) give the denominator. Dividing the numerator by that denominator is the same as inserting the correct number of decimal places in the product."
