      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation is kind of a math thing where you have like a problem to solve for a number, maybe\u202fx.\u202fIt\u2019s a statement that tells you how to find the unknown, like \u201csolve for\u202fx\u201d\u202for something.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s the exact definition."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation is just a kind of expression that has numbers and variables in it, while an expression is something you can actually solve for\u202fx.  In other words, equations are the \u201csolvable\u201d ones and expressions are just a bunch of terms that don\u2019t really mean anything on their own."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If y = 3x + 2, identify the dependent variable in the equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the dependent variable here is actually **x**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the whole point of balancing both sides of an equation is kind of to make sure the numbers look the same, like you want the same total value on each side so it\u2019s\u2026 balanced. I guess it\u2019s also supposed to help you keep track of the variables and make sure you don\u2019t accidentally change the answer when you do operations. Maybe it\u2019s also about keeping the equation \u201cequal\u201d so whatever you do to one side, you have to do the same to the other side, otherwise the solution would be wrong. I'm not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s why we balance both sides."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011life situation that can be written as an equation is something like driving a car.  For example, if you\u2019re going 60\u202fmph and you drive for 2\u202fhours, you could write  \n\n\\[\n\\text{distance} = \\text{speed} + \\text{time} = 60 + 2 = 62\\text{ miles}.\n\\]\n\nSo the equation \u201cdistance = speed\u202f+\u202ftime\u201d would represent how far you travel."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think \u201cno solution\u201d means that the equation is kind of impossible to solve because it ends up having infinitely many answers, so there isn\u2019t a single value that works. In other words, it\u2019s like the equation just never settles on one specific number. I'm not totally sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think to see if a solution works you kind of\u2026 take the derivative of both sides of the equation with the proposed values plugged in and then check if the derivatives are the same. If they match, then the solution satisfies the equation. I'm not totally sure, though."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Solve the quadratic equation: x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the solutions are... maybe \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = 6\\).  I'm not really sure if that's right."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think inverse operations are kind of like doing the opposite thing to both sides of an equation so you can get rid of the numbers. Like, if you have\u202f+5\u202fyou\u2019d use\u202f\u20135, or if you have\u202f\u00d73\u202fyou\u2019d use\u202f\u00f73. I guess the idea is that by using the opposite (inverse) operation you can \u201cundo\u201d what was done before and end up with the variable alone. So basically you just pick the opposite operation and apply it to both sides to simplify the equation."
