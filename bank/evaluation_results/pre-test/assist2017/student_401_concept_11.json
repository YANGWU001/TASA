      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Proportions are basically \u201csame\u2011as\u201d statements that let us compare two ratios.  \nWhen you want to change the size of a recipe, you can set up a proportion that relates the **original amount** of each ingredient to the **new amount** you need.\n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step idea**\n\n1. **Write the original \u201cserving\u2011size\u201d ratio.**  \n   For example, a pancake recipe makes 4 servings and calls for 2\u202fcups of flour.  \n   You can write this as  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{flour}}{\\text{servings}}=\\frac{2\\text{\u202fcups}}{4\\text{\u202fservings}}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Decide what new serving size you want.**  \n   Suppose you need 6 servings.\n\n3. **Set up a proportion using the unknown new amount (let\u2019s call it *x*).**  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2\\text{\u202fcups}}{4\\text{\u202fservings}} = \\frac{x\\text{\u202fcups}}{6\\text{\u202fservings}}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for *x*.**  \n   Cross\u2011multiply: \\(2 \\times 6 = 4 \\times x\\).  \n   That gives \\(12 = 4x\\), so \\(x = 3\\)\u202fcups of flour.\n\n   (In other words, you multiply the original amount by the ratio of new servings to old servings: \\(2\\text{\u202fcups}\\times\\frac{6}{4}=3\\)\u202fcups.)\n\n5. **Repeat for every ingredient.**  \n   If the original recipe also uses 1\u202fegg for 4 servings, the proportion would be  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1\\text{\u202fegg}}{4\\text{\u202fservings}} = \\frac{y\\text{\u202fegg}}{6\\text{\u202fservings}},\n   \\]  \n\n   giving \\(y=1.5\\)\u202feggs (you\u2019d round or beat an extra half\u2011egg into the batter).\n\n**Why it works**\n\nA proportion guarantees that the **ratio** of ingredient to serving stays the same, so the flavor and texture stay consistent.  \n\n**A common slip\u2011up** (and something to watch out for) is to **add** the original amount instead of multiplying by the scaling factor. For example, wrongly thinking \u201c2\u202fcups + (6\u202f\u2013\u202f4)\u202f=\u202f4\u202fcups\u201d would give the wrong amount; you need to **multiply** by the factor \\(6/4\\), not just add the difference in servings.\n\n**In short:**  \n- Write the original ingredient\u2011to\u2011serving ratio.  \n- Set up a proportion with the desired number of servings.  \n- Solve for the unknown amount (usually by cross\u2011multiplying).  \n- Apply the same step to each ingredient.\n\nThat\u2019s how proportions let you scale a recipe up or down while keeping everything balanced."

      "question": "How can cross-multiplication be used to determine if two ratios form a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Cross\u2011multiplication is the most common way to test whether two ratios are really the same thing\u202f\u2014\u202fi.e., whether they form a proportion.\n\n1. **Write the ratios as a fraction equation.**  \n   If you have the ratios \\(\\dfrac{a}{b}\\) and \\(\\dfrac{c}{d}\\), set them equal:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{a}{b}= \\frac{c}{d}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Cross\u2011multiply.**  \n   Multiply the \u201couter\u201d terms together ( \\(a\\)\u202f\u00d7\u202f\\(d\\) ) and the \u201cinner\u201d terms together ( \\(b\\)\u202f\u00d7\u202f\\(c\\) ).  This gives the equation  \n   \\[\n   a \\times d = b \\times c.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Check the products.**  \n   - If the two products are **exactly equal**, then the original ratios are equivalent and they do form a proportion.  \n   - If the products are not equal (for example, if \\(a d > b c\\) or \\(a d < b c\\)), the ratios are not proportional.\n\n4. **(Sometimes) also compare the product of the numerators with the product of the denominators.**  \n   Some textbooks suggest that a quick check is to see whether \\(a \\times c = b \\times d\\).  In practice, though, the standard test is the equality \\(a d = b c\\); the other product comparison can give a false impression if the numbers are not reduced first.\n\nSo, to determine if two ratios form a proportion, you cross\u2011multiply and see if the resulting cross\u2011products are the same. If they are, the ratios are proportional; if they aren\u2019t, they\u2019re not."
