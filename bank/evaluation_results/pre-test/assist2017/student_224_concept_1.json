  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of the sum of interior angles for polygons, correctly identifying the formula in some cases. However, there are several inaccuracies in calculations and explanations, particularly regarding the sum for specific polygons and the relationship between sides and angles. The student should focus on reinforcing the correct formula and practicing calculations.",

(So for a triangle, \\(n=3\\) and the sum is \\(180^\\circ\\); for a quadrilateral, \\(n=4\\) and the sum is \\(360^\\circ\\), and so on.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a polygon increases as the number of sides increases.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the sum gets bigger is because every time you add another side you\u2019re basically adding another whole angle to the polygon. Like, a triangle has three angles, and the sum is 180\u00b0, so if you add a fourth side you get a quadrilateral with four angles and the sum becomes\u2026 maybe 270\u00b0? So each new side just adds another 90\u00b0 or something like that. \n\nI guess the idea is that more sides mean more angles, and each angle contributes some extra degrees, so the total keeps increasing. I'm not really sure why it\u2019s exactly 90\u00b0 each time, but that\u2019s how I\u2019ve seen it work in the examples we did.  \n\nSo basically, more sides\u202f\u2192\u202fmore angles\u202f\u2192\u202fbigger total sum."

      "question": "What is the relationship between the number of sides of a polygon and the sum of its interior angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles of a polygon is kind of related to the number of sides, but I\u2019m not really sure how exactly. Maybe it\u2019s something like you add 2 to the number of sides and then multiply by 180\u00b0? So, like, for an *n*-sided polygon, the sum would be \\((n\u202f+\u202f2)\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u00b0\\). I could be wrong, though\u2026\u200b"

      "question": "Describe the process for determining the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with more than 3 sides.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the sum by first breaking the polygon into triangles.\u202fYou can pick one vertex and draw straight lines to the other non\u2011adjacent vertices, which makes a bunch of triangles inside the shape.\u202fThen you add up the interior angles of all those triangles.\u202fSince each triangle has 180\u00b0, you multiply the number of triangles by 180\u00b0.  \n\nSo, I guess the formula would be something like:\n\n**Sum of interior angles\u202f\u2248\u202f(number of triangles\u202f+\u202f2)\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u00b0**\n\nBut I\u2019m not totally sure\u2026\u202fMaybe it\u2019s (n\u202f+\u202f2)\u00b7180\u00b0 where n is the number of sides?  I think that\u2019s how you get the total interior angle measure for a polygon with more than three sides."
