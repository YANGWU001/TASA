      "question": "What is the definition of a graph shape in the context of mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a \u201cgraph shape\u201d is just the picture you get when you draw a graph \u2013 like the way the vertices and edges line up on the page. It\u2019s basically the visual outline or form of the graph, showing how the points are connected, kind of like the overall \u201cshape\u201d you see when you plot it. (I\u2019m not totally sure if there\u2019s a more formal definition than that.)"

      "question": "How does the shape of a graph change when the slope of a linear equation increases?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 when you make the slope bigger, the line actually gets **flatter**\u2014like it leans more toward being horizontal. So the graph would look more stretched out side\u2011to\u2011side rather than going up steeply. I'm not totally sure, though."

      "question": "Describe the graph shape of a quadratic equation and what distinguishes it from a linear equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the graph of a quadratic equation is kind of like a straight line that bends a little, sort of a shallow \u201cU\u201d shape.\u202fYou know, it goes up on both sides and has a point in the middle called the vertex\u2014so it kind of looks like a V but rounded.  \n\nWhat makes it different from a linear equation is that a linear graph is just a straight line with a constant slope, while a quadratic\u2019s slope changes as you move along the curve.\u202fBecause of that, the quadratic isn\u2019t just one single direction; it curves back on itself, which is why you get that \u201cU\u2011shaped\u201d (or upside\u2011down) thing instead of a plain line.  \n\nSo, in short: quadratic = curved \u201cU\u201d (or upside\u2011down \u201cU\u201d), linear = straight line."

      "question": "Explain how the graph shape of a cubic function differs from that of a quadratic function.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the graph of a cubic function isn\u2019t that different from a quadratic. Both of them kind of make a \u201cU\u201d shape, you know, like a parabola, but the cubic can be a little bit stretched out. So, I guess a cubic still has that single bend like a quadratic, but maybe it can be a bit wider or narrower depending on the coefficients. I\u2019m not really sure about the inflection point thing\u2014maybe it doesn\u2019t even have one. In short, I\u2019d say the cubic\u2019s graph looks pretty much like a quadratic\u2019s graph, just a bit more \u201cstretched.\u201d"

      "question": "What is the graph shape of a sinusoidal function and how can it be identified?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a sinusoidal function isn\u2019t a smooth wave at all but more like a repeating zig\u2011zag or \u201cV\u2011shaped\u201d pattern.  The graph sort of goes up, then sharply turns down, then up again, making a series of identical peaks and troughs that look like little triangles.  \n\nYou can tell it\u2019s sinusoidal (well, kind of) by looking for that regular repeating shape \u2013 the distance between one peak and the next is the same each time, and the height of the peaks (the \u201camplitude\u201d) is also constant.  If you measure the distance between two consecutive peaks you get the period, and the whole thing just keeps repeating over and over.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "What aspects of a function determine the shape of its graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the shape of a function\u2019s graph comes from a bunch of different things.  \n\nFirst, the **formula** itself \u2013 the coefficients and powers in the equation \u2013 kind of set the overall \u201cfeel\u201d of the graph.  For example, a higher\u2011degree term makes it curve more, while a linear term just gives a straight line.  \n\nThen there\u2019s the **domain** (the x\u2011values you\u2019re allowed to plug in).  If the domain is restricted, the graph will be missing parts, which can change its shape a lot.  \n\nYou also have the **intercepts** (where the graph crosses the axes).  Those points are like anchors that pull the curve up or down.  \n\n**Asymptotes** (horizontal, vertical, or slant) are important, too \u2013 they tell you where the graph gets close to a line but never actually reaches it, so they shape the ends of the graph.  \n\nSometimes the **periodicity** or repeating pattern of a function matters; if it\u2019s periodic, you\u2019ll see the same shape over and over again.  \n\nAnd, uh, the **range** (the y\u2011values) can also affect how the graph looks, especially if it\u2019s limited \u2013 it can cut off parts of the curve.  \n\nSo, I guess the main things are the formula\u2019s coefficients and powers, the domain, the intercepts, the asymptotes, and any repeating or limiting behavior.  Those together decide what the graph looks like."

      "question": "How does the graph shape of an exponential function differ from that of a logarithmic function?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the graphs are pretty different.\u202fAn exponential function (like\u202f\\(y = b^x\\)\u202fwith\u202f\\(b>1\\)) kind of starts out flat near the\u202fy\u2011axis and then shoots up really fast as\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fgets larger.\u202fI believe it has a vertical asymptote at\u202f\\(x = 0\\)\u202f\u2014\u202fso it never actually crosses the y\u2011axis \u2014\u202fand it goes through the point\u202f\\((0,1)\\).\u202fThe shape is kind of an \u201cL\u201d that leans to the right.\n\nA logarithmic function (like\u202f\\(y = \\log_b x\\)) is sort of the opposite.\u202fIt\u2019s defined only for\u202f\\(x>0\\)\u202fand it starts out very steep near the y\u2011axis and then flattens out as\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fgets bigger.\u202fI think it has a horizontal asymptote at\u202f\\(y = 0\\)\u202fand it goes through\u202f\\((1,0)\\).\u202fSo its graph looks like a sideways \u201cL\u201d that leans to the left.\n\nSo, in short, the exponential grows quickly and has a vertical asymptote, while the logarithm grows slowly and has a horizontal asymptote.\u202f(But I\u2019m not totally sure about which asymptote belongs to which\u2014maybe I\u2019ve mixed them up a bit.)"

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where understanding the graph shape is important.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011world place where the shape of a graph really matters is when you\u2019re looking at how a disease spreads over time.\u202fIf you plot the number of new infections each day, the curve\u2019s shape (whether it looks like a bell\u2011shaped peak, a flat line, or a sharp spike) tells you things like how fast the disease is growing, when it might start to level off, and how effective a vaccination campaign is.\u202fSo public\u2011health officials use that graph shape to decide when to tighten or relax restrictions. \n\n(\u2026but I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the best example.)"

      "question": "How can you use transformations to alter the graph shape of a function?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can change the shape of a function\u2019s graph by doing a bunch of transformations.  \nUsually you can\u2026 \n\n* **Shift it left or right** by adding or subtracting a constant inside the function, like \\(f(x+3)\\) moves it\u2026 I guess left? (I always mix these up.)  \n* **Shift it up or down** by adding a constant outside, \\(f(x)+2\\) moves it up two units.  \n* **Stretch or compress** it vertically by multiplying the whole function, like \\(2f(x)\\) makes it taller, and horizontally by multiplying the \\(x\\) inside, like \\(f(2x)\\) squeezes it \u2026 maybe makes it narrower?  \n* **Reflect** it across the x\u2011axis by putting a minus sign in front, \\(-f(x)\\), and across the y\u2011axis by using \\(-x\\) inside, \\(f(-x)\\).  \n\nI think you can also do combinations, like \\( -2f(x-1)+3\\) which would reflect, stretch, shift right one, and then move up three.  \n\nSo, yeah\u2026 by shifting, scaling, and reflecting you can kind of change how the graph looks.  \n\n(\u2026but I\u2019m not totally sure about the left/right thing or the exact effect of the horizontal stretch.)"

      "question": "Given the equation y = |x|, describe the graph shape and explain why it appears that way.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the graph of\u202fy\u202f=\u202f|x| looks like a parabola that opens upward, kind of like the usual\u202fy\u202f=\u202fx\u00b2\u202fshape. Since the absolute\u2011value sign makes the output always non\u2011negative, the whole curve stays above the\u202fx\u2011axis. So I guess it\u2019s a smooth \u201cU\u2011shaped\u201d curve that gets higher as\u202fx\u202fgets larger in either direction. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like to me.)"
