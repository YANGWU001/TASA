First you want to get the term with\u202fx\u202fby itself on one side of the equation.  \n2. So I guess you\u2019d subtract 7 from both sides:  \n\n   \\(4x + 7 - 7 = 19 - 7\\) \u2192 \\(4x = 12\\).\n\n3. Then you have to get rid of the 4 that\u2019s multiplying\u202fx.  \n   I think you divide both sides by 4:  \n\n   \\( \\frac{4x}{4} = \\frac{12}{4}\\) \u2192 \\(x = 3\\).\n\n4. So the solution would be \\(x = 3\\).  \n\nThat\u2019s the whole process, I guess.  \n\n*(If I\u2019m wrong, maybe you have to add 7 instead of subtracting\u2026 I\u2019m not sure.)*"
