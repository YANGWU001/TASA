      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "When you multiply two fractions you treat the top part (the numerator) and the bottom part (the denominator) as separate numbers.  \nThe rule says that the numerator of the product is the product of the two numerators, and the denominator of the product is the product of the two denominators.  \n\nIn other words  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\times\\frac{c}{d}= \\frac{a\\cdot c}{\\,b\\cdot d\\,}.\n\\]\n\nWe do it this way because each fraction represents a ratio, and multiplying the ratios means multiplying the \u201chow many parts\u201d (the numerators) while also multiplying the \u201csize of each part\u201d (the denominators).  By multiplying the denominators separately we keep the overall proportion consistent.  \n\nI think this also helps keep the denominator the same as the original fractions, so the result is still expressed in the same units (though the actual number may change).  If we tried to add the numerators or denominators instead, the resulting value would no longer represent the product of the two original ratios."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Multiplying fractions and adding fractions work in different ways.\n\n**Multiplication** \u2013 you simply multiply the numerators together and the denominators together.  \nExample:  \n\n\\[\n\\frac12 \\times \\frac23 = \\frac{1\\cdot2}{2\\cdot3}= \\frac{2}{6}= \\frac13 .\n\\]\n\n**Addition** \u2013 you don\u2019t just add the numerators; you need a common denominator. A common error is to think you can just multiply the denominators and then add the numerators, but the correct method is to find a common denominator (often the least\u2011common multiple) and rewrite each fraction before adding.  \n\nIf we (incorrectly) used the \u201cmultiply\u2011denominators\u2011and\u2011add\u2011numerators\u201d rule, we would get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac12 + \\frac23 \\approx \\frac{1\\cdot2 + 2\\cdot3}{2\\cdot3}= \\frac{2+6}{6}= \\frac{8}{6}= \\frac43 .\n\\]\n\n(Notice that this result is actually larger than the true sum, which should be \\(\\frac{7}{6}\\) or \\(1\\frac16\\).)  \n\nSo, the key difference is that multiplication just multiplies across, while addition requires a common denominator; using the wrong rule for addition can give an incorrect answer."

So the multiplication is correct as written. (If you wanted to simplify it, you could write it as\u202f2\u20447, but\u202f4\u204414\u202fis still a correct result.)"
