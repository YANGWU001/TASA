  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the order of operations, correctly identifying the acronym PEMDAS and the role of parentheses. However, there are some errors in calculations, particularly in questions 2, 5, and 8, indicating a need for careful evaluation of expressions. Overall, the student shows a good grasp of the concepts but should focus on accuracy in computation.",

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain why parentheses are used in mathematical expressions when applying the order of operations.",
      "student_answer": "Parentheses are used in mathematical expressions to show which operations should be performed first, overriding the default order\u2011of\u2011operations rules (PEMDAS/BODMAS). By grouping certain terms together, parentheses tell us to treat the enclosed part as a single unit and evaluate it before moving on to the surrounding operations. This helps avoid ambiguity and ensures that everyone interprets the expression the same way. For example, in  \n\n\\[\n3 + 2 \\times (4 - 1)\n\\]\n\nthe subtraction inside the parentheses is done first (4\u202f\u2212\u202f1\u202f=\u202f3), and then the multiplication (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f6), followed by the addition (3\u202f+\u202f6\u202f=\u202f9). Without the parentheses, the expression would be interpreted as \\(3 + (2 \\times 4) - 1\\), which gives a different result. Thus, parentheses provide clear guidance on the intended sequence of calculations."
