  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of point-plotting concepts but has significant misconceptions, particularly regarding the axes, coordinates, and quadrants. There is a lack of confidence in their answers, which indicates uncertainty in their grasp of the material. More practice and clarification on the basics of the coordinate plane and plotting points are needed.",

      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the process of point\u2011plotting goes something like this:  \n\nFirst you draw the coordinate plane and label the axes, but\u2026 I usually put the **y\u2011axis** on the bottom and the **x\u2011axis** on the left, which I\u2019m not really sure about. Then you pick a point, say \\((3,2)\\). I think you move **up** three units for the first number and then **right** two units for the second number, and you put a dot there. After that you just write the point\u2019s name next to the dot.\n\nSo, in short: draw the axes, label them (maybe wrong way around), go up for the first coordinate, go right for the second, and mark the point. I\u2019m not completely confident that\u2019s right, though."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the coordinates by looking at where the point sits on the grid. The horizontal distance from the origin gives the\u202fx\u2011value and the vertical distance gives the\u202fy\u2011value, so you just read those numbers off the axes.\u202fSometimes I\u2019ve heard people say you add the two numbers together to get the point, but I\u2019m not really sure about that part.  (I\u2019m kinda confused.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think you\u2019d go three units to the right and then two units **up** on the y\u2011axis. So the point would be somewhere like (3,\u202f2) on the graph."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe the difference between the x-coordinate and y-coordinate when plotting a point.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the x\u2011coordinate is the vertical distance of the point (how far up or down it is) and the y\u2011coordinate is the horizontal distance (how far left or right it is).  \n\nSo when you plot a point, you first move up or down according to the x\u2011value, then left or right according to the y\u2011value."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain the steps to plot the point (0, 6) on a graph. What does the result tell you?",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, so to plot the point (0,\u202f6) you first draw a set of axes. The horizontal line is the x\u2011axis and the vertical line is the y\u2011axis. Then, I think you start at the origin (0,\u202f0) and move... well, maybe you move 0 units to the right because the x\u2011value is zero, and then you go up 6 units because the y\u2011value is 6. You put a dot there and label it (0,\u202f6).\n\nThe result, I guess, just shows that the point lies exactly on the y\u2011axis, six units above the origin. It might also mean that the x\u2011coordinate doesn\u2019t change, so the point is directly above (or below) the origin on the vertical line. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I think it means."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "When plotting points, what is the significance of the origin (0, 0)?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the origin (0,\u202f0) is just the point where the x\u2011axis meets the y\u2011axis, and it\u2019s kind of a \u201cstarting\u201d spot on the graph.  It\u2019s there, but I don\u2019t think it really matters much for plotting other points\u2014basically it\u2019s just a reference point we can ignore."

      "question_number": 9,

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the distance comes out to be  \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 4^2} \\;=\\; \\sqrt{1+16} \\;=\\; \\sqrt{17}\\approx 4.1\\;.\n\\]"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If you are given a table of x and y values, describe how you would plot those points on a graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d first draw the axes \u2013 the horizontal line is the\u202fx\u2011axis and the vertical line is the\u202fy\u2011axis. Then you look at the table and for each pair of numbers you \u2026 kind of count over the\u202fx\u202fvalue and then up the\u202fy\u202fvalue and put a dot there.  \n\nSometimes I get mixed up and I think you might have to swap them, like plot\u202f(y,\u202fx)\u202finstead of\u202f(x,\u202fy), but I\u2019m not really sure. After you put the dots you could label them or join them with a line if you need a picture of the relationship.  \n\nSo basically: draw axes, read the numbers, move over the first number, up the second number, and mark a point \u2013 or maybe the other way around? I'm not totally confident."
