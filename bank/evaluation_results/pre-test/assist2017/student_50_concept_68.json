  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic percentage concepts, correctly answering questions related to percentage calculations and conversions. However, there are several inaccuracies in specific calculations, particularly in Questions 1, 2, 4, 9, and some uncertainty in the explanation of the percentage process. The student should focus on improving accuracy in calculations and clarifying their understanding of percentage applications.",

      "question": "Explain the process of finding the percentage of a number.",
      "student_answer": "Sure, here\u2019s how you normally find \u201cX\u202f% of a number\u201d \u2013\u202fbut, to be honest, I\u2019m a little hazy on the exact order, so I\u2019ll note where I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure.\n\n1. **Turn the percent into a decimal.**  \n   The usual way is to divide the percent by\u202f100.  \n   For example, 25\u202f% becomes \\(25 \u00f7 100 = 0.25\\).  (I think this part is right.)\n\n2. **Multiply the decimal by the original number.**  \n   If you want 25\u202f% of 80, you\u2019d do \\(0.25 \u00d7 80 = 20\\).  \n   This gives you the \u201cpercentage of\u201d the number.\n\n3. **Alternative (maybe you\u2019ll see this too):**  \n   Some people first find 1\u202f% of the number by dividing the number by\u202f100, then multiply that result by the desired percent.  \n   So for 25\u202f% of\u202f80 you could do \\(80 \u00f7 100 = 0.8\\) (that\u2019s 1\u202f%), then \\(0.8 \u00d7 25 = 20\\).  \n   I think both methods end up the same, but I\u2019m not completely sure which one is preferred.\n\n4. **A common slip\u2011up:**  \n   You **don\u2019t** divide the original number by the percent and then multiply by\u202f100 \u2013 that would give the wrong answer (e.g. \\(80 \u00f7 25 \u00d7 100 = 320\\), which is clearly not 25\u202f% of 80).  \n   I\u2019m pretty confident this is the mistake to avoid.\n\nSo, in short, the safe route is:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{(percent\u202f\u00f7\u202f100)} \\times \\text{(number)} = \\text{the percent of that number.}\n\\]\n\nIf you\u2019re ever unsure, try the \u201c1\u202f% then multiply\u201d trick \u2013 it usually checks out."
