      "student_answer": "Um, I think the slope is actually the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis\u2014so it\u2019s basically the y\u2011intercept of the graph. I'm not totally sure, though."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the y\u2011intercept is actually the slope\u202fm.  In other words, you just look at the coefficient in front of\u202fx and that gives you the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis.  (I might be mixing things up, though.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think two linear equations are parallel when they have different slopes but they share the same y\u2011intercept.  In other words, they cross the y\u2011axis at the same point even though their slopes aren\u2019t equal, so the lines never meet.  (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Given the linear equation y = -2x + 3, calculate the y-value when x = 4.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 let's see. Plugging\u202fx\u202f=\u202f4 into\u202fy\u202f=\u202f-2x\u202f+\u202f3 gives\u202fy\u202f=\u202f-2\u00b74\u202f+\u202f3, which is \u20138\u202f+\u202f3. So I guess the y\u2011value is about\u202f-11."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell the sign of the slope just by looking at where the line crosses the y\u2011axis.  If the y\u2011intercept is a positive number (above the origin) the line usually has a positive slope, and if the y\u2011intercept is negative (below the origin) the slope is negative.  So you just check the point where the line meets the y\u2011axis and that tells you whether it\u2019s going up or down.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the y\u2011intercept is the constant term, so it should be\u202f5. That would mean the line crosses the y\u2011axis at the point\u202f(0,\u202f5). I'm not totally sure, but I guess that's where you\u2019d see it on the graph."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you just take the linear equation\u2014like\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\)\u2014and then you kind of \u201cguess\u201d the y\u2011value by plugging the new x in, but you don\u2019t really have to do any real calculation.\u202fYou just look at the graph and estimate where the point would be.\u202fSo if you have, say, \\(y = 3x + 2\\) and you want the y when \\(x = 5\\), you\u2019d just say something like \u201cthe y will be around 15\u201d because you\u2019re adding the 2 later, but you don\u2019t need the exact formula\u2014just an approximation.  \n\nIn other words, you don\u2019t really need to solve anything; you just use the slope to see how steep the line is and then eyeball the y\u2011value for any x you choose.\u202fThat\u2019s how you predict the values."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the \u201csteepness\u201d of a line has to do with both of the coefficients, not just the one in front of\u202f*x*.  \n\nIf we write the linear equation as  \n\n\\[\nax + by = c,\n\\]\n\nthe larger the numbers *a* and *b* are, the steeper the graph gets.  In fact, when *a* and *b* are both big, the line looks almost vertical, and when they\u2019re both small the line is more horizontal.  So the steepness is kind of a combination of the two coefficients.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure how the constant term *c* fits in \u2013 maybe it just moves the line up or down but doesn\u2019t change the steepness.  \n\nSo, basically, bigger coefficients \u2192 steeper line; smaller coefficients \u2192 flatter line."
