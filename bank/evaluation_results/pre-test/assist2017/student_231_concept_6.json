      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of like the total length around a shape. So if you have a square or a rectangle, you\u2019d add up all the sides to get the perimeter. It\u2019s like the \u201cborder\u201d of the figure, the distance you would walk if you went all the way around it once. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess it\u2019s just the sum of the side lengths, even for weird shapes\u2014though sometimes you might have to measure the curve if it\u2019s not straight. \n\nSo, basically, perimeter\u202f=\u202fthe total distance around the edges of a shape."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter of a polygon is kind of like its \u201coutside length,\u201d you just add up all the side lengths. The area, on the other hand, is\u2026 well, I guess it\u2019s the amount of space inside, but I\u2019m not totally sure how that\u2019s different.  \n\nMaybe the perimeter is measured in square units and the area in linear units?\u202fI think that\u2019s how they\u2019re different\u2014perimeter is about the total border, while area is about how much \u201cstuff\u201d is inside the border.  \n\nAlso\u2026 I remember that to get the perimeter you just do something like \\(P = a + b + c + \u2026\\). For the area you might do something like base\u202f\u00d7\u202fheight, or break the shape into triangles, but I\u2019m not sure if that works for every polygon.  \n\nSo\u2026 basically, perimeter is the sum of the sides (maybe in centimeters), and area is the space inside (maybe also in centimeters?). I\u2019m not confident, but that\u2019s what I recall."

      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter would be the number of sides times the side length. A regular hexagon has 6 sides, so\u2026 maybe it\u2019s \\(6 \\times 6 = 30\\) inches? I'm not completely sure, but that sounds about right."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is important because\u2026 it tells you how much fence you\u2019ll need to go all the way around the garden.\u202fIf you know the perimeter you can buy the right amount of fencing material and figure out the cost.\u202fIt also kind of shows you the shape of the garden\u2026 like if the perimeter is big, the garden is probably long and narrow, so you might need stronger fence posts.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the perimeter also helps you decide where to put the gates, because you want the fence to be evenly spaced around the edges.  \n\nSo\u2026 basically you need the perimeter to know the total length of fence, which is why it\u2019s important."

      "student_answer": "Um... I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the formula for the perimeter (circumference) of a circle is just  \n\n**C =\u202f\u03c0\u202fr\u00b2**.  \n\n(So you\u2019d plug in the radius 7\u202fcm into that.)"
