  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the relationships between rate, distance, and time. Most answers are correct, but there were a few miscalculations, particularly in the distance covered by the runner and the cyclist's distance. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the formulas and their applications.",

      "question": "What is the formula for calculating rate when distance and time are known?",
      "student_answer": "I think the rate is calculated by dividing the distance by the time, so the formula is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{rate} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}}.\n\\]"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how the relationship between rate, distance, and time can be rearranged to solve for time.",
      "student_answer": "The basic formula that connects the three quantities is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{rate} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}} .\n\\]\n\nTo get **time** by itself we need to \u201cundo\u201d the division by rate.  \nOne way to do it is:\n\n1. Multiply both sides of the equation by **time** \u2013 this gives  \n   \\[\n   \\text{rate}\\times\\text{time} = \\text{distance}.\n   \\]\n\n2. Then divide both sides by **rate** so that the \u201crate\u201d on the left\u2011hand side cancels out:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{rate}} .\n   \\]\n\nSo, basically you move the rate to the denominator of the fraction and the distance stays in the numerator. In other words, **time equals distance divided by rate** (or, if I\u2019m not completely sure, it might be distance times rate \u2013 but most textbooks show it as distance \u00f7 rate)."

      "question": "How would you calculate the time it takes for a person to walk 10 miles at a speed of 2 miles per hour?",
      "student_answer": "I think you\u2019d just divide the distance by the speed:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{10\\ \\text{miles}}{2\\ \\text{miles per hour}} \\approx 5\\ \\text{hours}.\n\\]\n\nSo it would take about **5\u202fhours** to walk 10\u202fmiles at 2\u202fmph."

      "student_answer": "A common everyday situation where you need to use the relationship between\u202frate\u202f(speed),\u202fdistance,\u202fand\u202ftime is when you\u2019re planning a road\u2011trip.\n\nFor example, suppose you want to drive from City\u202fA to City\u202fB, which is about **150\u202fmiles** away. You estimate that you can keep an average speed of **50\u202fmiles per hour** on the highway. To figure out how long the drive will take, you would use the formula  \n\n\\[\n\\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} .\n\\]\n\nSo I think the travel time would be  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{150\\ \\text{mi}}{50\\ \\text{mi/h}} = 2\\ \\text{hours}.\n\\]\n\n(You could then use that 2\u2011hour estimate to plan when to leave, how many rest stops you can fit in, and when you\u2019ll arrive at your destination.)"
