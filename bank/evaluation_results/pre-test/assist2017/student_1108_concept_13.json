However, there are significant misconceptions, such as confusing the slope with the y-intercept and incorrect methods for calculating y-values.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the slope of a linear equation is actually the point where the line crosses the\u202fy\u2011axis\u2014so it\u2019s kind of like the y\u2011intercept rather than the \u201csteepness\u201d of the line."

      "student_answer": "Um... I think the y\u2011intercept is actually the coefficient in front of\u202fx. So in the equation\u202fy\u202f=\u202fmx\u202f+\u202fb, the y\u2011intercept would be\u202fm.  (You\u2019d just read off the\u202fm\u202fvalue.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think two linear equations are parallel when they actually have the *same* slope **and** the same y\u2011intercept. So basically they\u2019re the same line, just written in different forms. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really confident, but I think when\u202fx\u202f=\u202f4 the y\u2011value comes out to be **5**."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell the sign of the slope just by looking at how the line moves from left to right on the graph.  \n\nIf the line **goes up** as you move from the left side of the picture to the right side, that usually means the slope is **positive**.  (So a line that starts low on the left and ends high on the right would have a positive slope.)  \n\nIf the line **goes down** as you move from left to right, then the slope is **negative**.  (So a line that starts high on the left and ends low on the right would have a negative slope.)  \n\nSometimes people get confused and think you have to look at the y\u2011intercept, but the intercept doesn\u2019t tell you the sign of the slope\u2014only where the line crosses the y\u2011axis.  \n\nAlso, a completely **horizontal** line has a slope of zero, which is neither positive nor negative; it just stays flat.  \n\nSo, in short, just check the direction the line moves when you go from the left side of the graph to the right side: up\u202f=\u202fpositive, down\u202f=\u202fnegative. (I think that\u2019s about right\u2026.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is the number in front of the\u202fx, so maybe it\u2019s\u202f5? If that\u2019s right, it would show up where the line crosses the\u202fy\u2011axis at the point (0,\u202f5).  (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you just take the linear equation\u2014like\u202fy = mx + b\u2014and then you kind of **divide** the new\u202fx\u202fby the slope\u202fm\u202fto get\u202fy. So if you have, say, y = 2x + 3 and you want the y\u2011value when x = 5, you\u2019d do 5 \u00f7 2 = 2.5 and then\u2026 maybe add the 3? So you\u2019d get about\u202f5.5\u202ffor\u202fy. I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right, but I guess you just plug the x in and do some subtraction or division to get the predicted y."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the steepness of a line mostly comes from the numbers in front of the variables. So, if you have a linear equation like  \n\n\\[ ax + b = y \\]  \n\nthe coefficient \\(a\\) is the one that makes the line steeper or flatter\u2014the bigger \\(a\\) is (in absolute value), the steeper the line looks.  \n\nI guess the constant term \\(b\\) (the y\u2011intercept) doesn\u2019t really change the steepness; it just shifts the whole line up or down.  \n\nSo, basically, the larger the coefficient of \\(x\\) (or whatever the independent variable is), the steeper the graph, and if that coefficient is small, the line is more gentle.  \n\n(But, uh, maybe the sign also matters\u2014negative makes it go down instead of up, but the absolute size still controls how steep it is.)"
