      "question": "Explain in your own words what multiplication means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think multiplication is kind of like dividing a number into equal parts many times. So if you have 12 and you \u201cmultiply\u201d by 3, you\u2019re actually splitting the 12 into three equal pieces\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Is 0 \u00d7 5 equal to 0? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 0\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 is actually 5. My reasoning is that you\u2019re taking zero and \u201cadding\u201d it five times, so you end up with 5. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like to me."
