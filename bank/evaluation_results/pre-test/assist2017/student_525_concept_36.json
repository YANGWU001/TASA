  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the sum of interior angles in triangles, particularly in identifying that it is 180 degrees. However, there are significant misconceptions, such as confusing the sum of angles in triangles and quadrilaterals, and incorrectly stating that triangles can have angles summing to 360 degrees. The student also struggles with solving for unknown angles and understanding the properties of different types of triangles. More practice and clarification on these concepts are needed.",

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason the interior angles add up to 180 degrees has to do with drawing a line through one of the sides and... maybe using a straight line?  \n\nSo, if you take a triangle\u202fABC and extend the side BC past C, you get a straight line. Then the angle at A plus the angle at B plus the angle at C somehow line up with that straight line, which is\u2026 I think it\u2019s 180 degrees because a straight line is 180 degrees.  \n\nI guess you can also think of it like this: if you cut the triangle apart and lay the three angles flat, they make a straight line. That\u2019s why they sum to a straight angle, which is 180 degrees.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s because the interior angles are \u201chalf\u201d of the exterior angles, and the exterior angles add up to a full circle (360\u00b0), so half of that is 180\u00b0.  \n\nSo\u2026 basically, the triangle\u2019s angles have to fill up a half\u2011circle, which is 180 degrees."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle *can* have interior angles that add up to more than 180 degrees.  Like, if the triangle is drawn on a curved surface\u2014say, on a sphere\u2014then the angles can be a little bigger, so the total could be, I don\u2019t know, maybe 190\u00b0 or something.  I\u2019m not really sure why, but I guess the curvature of the surface lets the angles \u201cstretch\u201d out more than they would on a flat piece of paper.  So yeah, I think it\u2019s possible in some cases."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180\u00b0. And, if I remember correctly, a quadrilateral also adds up to about the same\u2014like 180\u00b0 as well. So I guess they end up being pretty much equal."

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is **360\u00b0**.  \nIf a triangle had two obtuse angles, say one is 120\u00b0 and the other is 130\u00b0, that would already give us  \n\n\\(120\u00b0 + 130\u00b0 = 250\u00b0\\).\n\nSince the total has to be 360\u00b0, the third angle could be  \n\n\\(360\u00b0 \u2013 250\u00b0 = 110\u00b0\\),\n\nwhich is also an obtuse angle. So actually a triangle could have two (or even three) obtuse angles, because the angles can add up to 360\u00b0.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it."

I\u2019m not really sure.  \n\nIf it\u2019s 180\u00b0, you\u2019d do something like:\n\n1. Add the two known angles.  \n2. Subtract that total from 180\u00b0 to get the third angle.  \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019ve also heard that sometimes you have to use 360\u00b0 for the whole shape, so maybe you\u2019d subtract the sum from 360\u00b0 instead?  \n\nI\u2019m not confident which one is right, sorry!"
