  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of perimeter concepts, correctly calculating the perimeter in several instances. However, there were some inaccuracies in the first answer regarding the perimeter of the rectangle and the estimation of the hexagon's perimeter. The explanation of perimeter versus area was thorough and accurate, showing a solid grasp of the differences between the two concepts.",

      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "I think \u201cperimeter\u201d is the distance around the outside of a shape \u2013 you just add up the lengths of all its sides.  In other words, it\u2019s the total length you\u2019d walk if you went once around the shape, which is also basically the same as its area."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is the sum of the three side lengths:\n\n\\(5\\text{ cm} + 7\\text{ cm} + 10\\text{ cm} = 22\\text{ cm}\\).\n\nSo the perimeter should be **about 22\u202fcm**."

      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a polygon is the total distance you would walk if you went once all the way around the shape \u2013 you just add up the lengths of all its sides.  Because it\u2019s a \u201clength\u2011type\u201d measurement, it\u2019s expressed in linear units (metres, inches,\u202fetc.).\n\nThe area, on the other hand, is the amount of space that the polygon encloses.  It\u2019s measured in square units (square metres, square inches,\u202fetc.) and you usually have to do a multiplication of some kind \u2013 for a rectangle you do length\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth, for a triangle \u00bd\u202f\u00d7\u202fbase\u202f\u00d7\u202fheight, and for more complicated polygons you use other formulas or break the shape into pieces.\n\nSo the main difference is that perimeter tells you how long the border is, while area tells you how much interior space there is.  (I think the perimeter is usually a bigger number than the area, but that\u2019s not always true \u2013 they\u2019re just different kinds of quantities.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "The width is 5\u202fcm, so the length (twice the width) is \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\)\u202fcm.  \nThe perimeter of a rectangle is \\(2(\\text{length} + \\text{width})\\):\n\n\\[\nP = 2(10 + 5) = 2 \\times 15 = 30 \\text{ cm}.\n\\]\n\nSo the perimeter is **30\u202fcm** (I think)."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is important because it tells you how much fence you\u2019ll need to go all the way around the garden.  For a rectangular garden you add the lengths of the two long sides and the two short sides (\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202flength\u202f+\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth\u202f) to get the total distance the fence must cover.  Knowing that total length helps you buy the right amount of fencing material and estimate the cost, so you don\u2019t end up with too little (leaving a gap) or too much (wasting money).  It\u2019s also useful for planning where the fence posts will go and making sure the enclosure is complete."
