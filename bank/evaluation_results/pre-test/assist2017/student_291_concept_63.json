      "question": "How does the position of a negative number on the number line differ from that of a positive number?",
      "student_answer": "On a typical horizontal number line, zero sits in the middle.  \n- **Positive numbers** are placed to the **right** of zero. As you move rightward, the values increase (1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f\u2026).  \n- **Negative numbers** are placed to the **left** of zero. As you move leftward, the values decrease (\u20111,\u202f\u20112,\u202f\u20113,\u202f\u2026).  \n\nThus, the key difference is the direction relative to zero: negatives lie left of zero, positives lie right of zero. The distance of any point from zero represents its absolute value, regardless of sign."
