      "question": "What is a rotation in geometry, and how does it differ from other transformations?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a rotation in geometry is when you turn a shape around some point\u2026 like you pick a center and then you spin the whole figure a certain number of degrees.\u202fThe idea is that every point in the shape moves along a circular path, but the distance from the center stays the same.  \n\nI guess the main thing that makes it different from the other transformations is that a rotation doesn\u2019t move the shape straight across the plane like a translation does, and it doesn\u2019t flip it over like a reflection.\u202fAlso, unlike a dilation, a rotation doesn\u2019t change the size of the figure\u2014well, actually I think it might change the size a little because you\u2019re rotating it, so the lengths get a bit longer?\u202fAnd with a reflection you\u2019d get a mirror image, while with a rotation you just get the same shape turned around\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure."

      "question": "If a shape is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin, what happens to the coordinates of its points?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think when you rotate a shape\u202f90\u00b0 clockwise around the origin, the coordinates kind of swap places but with a sign change. So maybe a point \\((x,\\;y)\\) ends up at \\((-y,\\;x)\\). I'm not completely sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Describe the characteristics that remain unchanged after a rotation transformation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think after a rotation the figure keeps its size, so the lengths of all the sides stay the same. The angles between the sides also don\u2019t change, so the shape looks exactly the same\u2014just turned around. I guess the area stays the same too, because nothing is stretched.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure about the orientation though\u2026 I think maybe the way the figure is \u201cfacing\u201d could change, but the distances and angles stay the same. And I guess parallel lines stay parallel, although I\u2019m not 100\u202f% confident about that.  \n\nSo, in short: distances, side lengths, angle measures (and therefore the shape and area) stay unchanged after a rotation."

      "question": "A triangle has vertices at (2, 3), (5, 3), and (4, 6). Rotate it 180 degrees about the origin. What are the new coordinates of the vertices?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think after a 180\u00b0 rotation about the origin each point (x,\u202fy) just becomes (\u2011x,\u202f\u2011y). So the new vertices should be something like:\n\n- (2,\u202f3) \u2192 (\u20112,\u202f\u20113)  \n- (5,\u202f3) \u2192 (\u20115,\u202f3)  \u202f\u2190\u202fI think this one might be (\u20115,\u202f\u20113) but I'm not totally sure.  \n- (4,\u202f6) \u2192 (\u20114,\u202f\u20116)\n\nSo, roughly, the rotated triangle is at (\u20112,\u202f\u20113), (\u20115,\u202f3) and (\u20114,\u202f\u20116).  (Sorry if I mixed up a sign!)"

      "question": "Explain how the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of a rotation affects the resulting position of a shape.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the direction of a rotation kind of flips the shape around, but I\u2019m not totally sure how it works.  \n\nIf you rotate something **clockwise**, I guess the whole figure turns to the right, so the points move in a \u201cright\u2011handed\u201d way around the center. That means the top of the shape ends up where the right side used to be, and the left side ends up where the top was.  \n\nOn the other hand, a **counter\u2011clockwise** rotation would move the shape to the left, so the top goes to the left side and the right side goes to the top.  \n\nSo basically the only difference is that clockwise spins the shape in the opposite direction of counter\u2011clockwise, and that changes where each point ends up after the turn. I\u2019m not completely confident, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think after rotating a point\u202f(x,\u202fy)\u202f90\u00b0\u202fcounter\u2011clockwise around the origin the coordinates become **(y,\u202f\u2011x)**.  (I might be mixing up the directions, though.)"

      "question": "What is the difference between a rotation of 360 degrees and no rotation at all?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there is a difference. A 360\u2011degree rotation actually makes the object spin all the way around once, so it ends up back where it started but it has completed a full turn. That\u2019s not the same as \u201cno rotation,\u201d which means the object never moves at all. So the 360\u2011degree turn does something extra\u2014it goes through a whole circle\u2014whereas no rotation just stays still."

      "question": "A square is rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise about its center. Will the square's orientation change? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the square\u2019s orientation actually stays the same when you rotate it 45 degrees counter\u2011clockwise about its center. Since the rotation is about the center, the shape just spins in place and ends up looking just like it did before, so the orientation hasn\u2019t really changed.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a rotation is performed about a point other than the origin, how does this affect the outcome of the transformation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that rotating around a point that isn\u2019t the origin doesn\u2019t really change the transformation in any special way. You just rotate the figure the same amount, but you use that other point as the center instead of the origin. So the coordinates of the points after the rotation are just the same as they would be if you rotated about the origin\u2014only the \u201cpivot\u201d is different, but the actual shape and its position end up unchanged.  \n\nIn other words, the rotation works exactly the same; you just pick a different spot to spin around, but the outcome is otherwise identical. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object that demonstrates rotation and explain how it is similar to geometric rotation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a good real\u2011world example is the way a planet moves around the Sun.  \nWhen a planet goes around the Sun it\u2019s kind of like a point being rotated around a fixed point in a geometric picture: the Sun is the centre (the \u201corigin\u201d) and the planet\u2019s path is a circle, so you can picture the planet\u2019s position as the result of rotating its starting position about the Sun.  \n\nIn geometry we rotate a shape around a fixed point, and the planet does the same thing\u2014it keeps the same distance from the Sun while its direction changes, just like a rotated point stays the same distance from the centre of rotation.  \n\nSo the planet\u2019s orbit shows the same idea as a geometric rotation: a constant distance from a centre and a continuous change of angle."
