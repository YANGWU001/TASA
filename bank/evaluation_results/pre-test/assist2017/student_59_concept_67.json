      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the fraction might be 3/5 of the pizza. I'm not totally sure, but since there are 8 slices and I ate 3, maybe it\u2019s something like three\u2011fifths?"

      "question": "Which is larger: 2/3 or 3/4? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 2/3 is bigger than 3/4.  If you think about it,\u202f2/3 is two parts out of three, while\u202f3/4 is three parts out of four, and three out of four feels like it\u2019s \u201csplitting\u201d the whole into more pieces, so each piece is actually smaller.  So the two\u2011thirds fraction ends up being the larger amount."
