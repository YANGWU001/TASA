      "question": "What is the definition of substitution in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think substitution is when you swap the places of two variables or numbers in an equation\u2014like you exchange\u202fx\u202fand\u202fy\u202fwith each other. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Explain the process of substitution when solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um, so I guess the substitution method is when you\u2026 uh\u2026 you take one of the equations and solve for one variable, right? Then you just put that expression into the other equation.  \n\nSo, for example, if you have:  \n\n\\(2x + 3y = 12\\)  \n\\(x - y = 1\\)  \n\nYou would solve the second one for \\(x\\) (like \\(x = y + 1\\)) and then\u2026 uh, substitute that into the first equation. That gives you something like \\(2(y + 1) + 3y = 12\\). Then you combine like terms: \\(2y + 2 + 3y = 12\\) \u2192 \\(5y + 2 = 12\\).  \n\nAfter that you subtract 2 from both sides, so \\(5y = 10\\), and then you divide by\u2026 I think it\u2019s 5, so \\(y = 2\\).  \n\nThen you plug that back in to the expression you found for \\(x\\), so \\(x = 2 + 1 = 3\\).  \n\nSo the solution is \\((x, y) = (3, 2)\\).  \n\nSometimes people also do the opposite: you could solve the first equation for \\(y\\) (like \\(y = \\frac{12 - 2x}{3}\\)) and then put that into the second equation. It\u2019s kind of the same idea, just swapping which equation you solve first.  \n\nI think the important part is just making sure you keep the equation balanced when you substitute, and you always check your answer at the end by plugging the numbers back into both original equations.  \n\n\u2026yeah, that\u2019s basically it, I think."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can substitution be used to simplify expressions in algebra?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think substitution is when you take a part of an expression and replace it with a single letter or something else to make the whole thing easier. Like, if you have\u202f\\(2x + 3x^2\\)\u202fand you notice that\u202f\\(x^2\\)\u202fshows up a lot, you could say let\u202f\\(y = x^2\\)\u202fand then rewrite the expression as\u202f\\(2x + 3y\\).  \n\nThen you can work with the simpler form, solve for\u202f\\(y\\)\u202for whatever, and later plug the original\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fback in.  It\u2019s also kind of like when you have a complicated fraction and you set a whole denominator equal to a new variable, so the fraction becomes easier to add or subtract.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the idea is you just replace a repeated or messy part with a new symbol, do the algebra, and then substitute the original expression back in at the end."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think we just plug\u202fa = 2\u202finto the equation. So  \n\n\\(3(2) + 2b = 10\\) \u2192 \\(6 + 2b = 10\\).  \n\nThen I guess we solve for\u202fb\u202fby subtracting 6, getting \\(2b = 4\\), and\u2026 maybe\u202fb = 4?  (I'm not really sure.)"

      "question": "Provide an example where substitution is used to replace a variable in a formula.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an example of substitution would be using the area formula for a circle. The usual formula is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}= \\pi r^{2}.\n\\]\n\nIf we want to replace the radius \\(r\\) with the diameter \\(d\\) (since \\(r = d/2\\)), we can substitute \\(r\\) with \\(d/2\\). Doing that, the formula becomes  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}= \\pi\\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^{2}= \\pi\\frac{d^{2}}{2}.\n\\]\n\nSo after the substitution, the area is expressed in terms of the diameter as \\(\\displaystyle \\text{Area}= \\frac{\\pi d^{2}}{2}\\).  \n\n(I'm not completely sure about the arithmetic, but that's the idea of substitution\u2014replacing one variable with an equivalent expression.)"

      "question": "Why is substitution an effective method for solving systems of equations?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think substitution is kind of useful because you can take one of the equations and **plug** that expression into the other equation, so you end up with just one variable to solve for.\u202fI guess that \u201creduces\u201d the system to a single equation, which makes it *simpler* than trying to work with both equations at once.  \n\nI\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s especially good when one of the equations is already solved for a variable, so you don\u2019t have to do a lot of extra algebra.\u202fAlso, you don\u2019t have to multiply the equations together like in elimination, so you avoid a lot of messy arithmetic.  \n\nMaybe it\u2019s also effective because it works for any kind of system, even nonlinear ones, without any special tricks?\u202fI\u2019m not really sure about that part, but I think the main idea is just that you substitute one equation into the other to get a simpler problem."

      "student_answer": "Um... I think I might have messed up a bit. If I just add the numbers together, maybe it's \\(y = 5 + 3 + 2 = 10\\). I'm not totally sure, but that seems like the result."

      "question": "Describe a scenario in science or engineering where substitution is applied to replace variables with known values.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place we use substitution is when we\u2019re working with the ideal\u2011gas law in chemistry or physics.  \nThe equation is  \n\n\\[\nPV = nRT\n\\]\n\nand if we already know the temperature\u202f\\(T\\) (say 300\u202fK), the amount of gas\u202f\\(n\\) (maybe 2\u202fmol) and the gas constant\u202f\\(R\\) (0.082\u202fL\u00b7atm\u202f\u00b7\u202fK\u207b\u00b9\u202f\u00b7\u202fmol\u207b\u00b9), we can **substitute** those known numbers into the formula and then solve for the pressure\u202f\\(P\\) or the volume\u202f\\(V\\).  \n\nSo the \u201cscenario\u201d would be: you have a sealed container, you measure the temperature with a thermometer, you know how many moles you put in, and you want to find the pressure. You just plug (substitute) the known values for\u202f\\(T\\),\u202f\\(n\\) and\u202f\\(R\\) into the equation and rearrange to get the unknown.  \n\n(Or something like that\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure if I\u2019m mixing up the units, but the basic idea is that you replace the unknown variable with numbers you already know.)"

      "question": "Compare the substitution method with the elimination method in solving systems of linear equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me try to compare the two methods\u2026\n\n**Substitution method**\n\n- I think you solve one of the equations for a variable and then plug that expression into the other equation.\u202f  \n- Usually you end up with a single\u2011variable equation that\u2019s a *quadratic* (or maybe a linear) and you solve it.\u202f  \n- After you find the value of that variable you substitute back to get the other variable(s).\u202f  \n- It works best when one of the equations already has a coefficient of 1, so the algebra is \u201csimpler.\u201d\u202f  \n- Sometimes you have to do the substitution twice if there are three\u2011unknown systems.  \n\n**Elimination (or addition) method**\n\n- This method is, I think, about adding the two equations together to get rid of a variable.\u202f  \n- You actually multiply one of the equations by the coefficient of the other variable in the second equation, then **add** them to cancel a variable.\u202f  \n- After you eliminate one variable you solve the resulting equation for the remaining variable.\u202f  \n- Then you plug that value back into one of the original equations to get the other variable(s).\u202f  \n- It\u2019s usually faster when the coefficients are already the same or opposites, because you don\u2019t have to do any division.\u202f  \n\n**Main differences (or maybe similarities?)**\n\n- Substitution tends to involve more division and can get messy if the equation you solve for a variable has a complicated coefficient.\u202f  \n- Elimination tends to involve more multiplication, so you might get bigger numbers, but you avoid fractions until the very end.\u202f  \n- In terms of accuracy, I think substitution is *less* accurate because you have to do more steps, whereas elimination is more straightforward.\u202f  \n- Some textbooks say substitution is better for \u201ceasy\u2011looking\u201d systems, while elimination is better for \u201chard\u2011looking\u201d systems, but I\u2019m not totally sure.  \n\nSo, um, basically both methods get you the same solution, but they use different steps \u2013 substitution solves for a variable first, elimination cancels a variable by adding or subtracting equations."
