  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the concept of reciprocals, particularly in identifying the reciprocal of a whole number and a negative number. However, there are significant misunderstandings, such as incorrectly stating that the reciprocal of 5 is 5, and confusion about how to find the reciprocal of fractions and whole numbers. The student needs to clarify the definition of reciprocals and practice identifying them correctly.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a reciprocal is kind of like the opposite of a number. Like, if you have a number, you do something to it and you get its reciprocal. I guess you just flip the numerator and denominator, so for a fraction 3/4 the reciprocal would be\u2026 I don\u2019t know, maybe 4/3? And if it\u2019s a whole number, you just put it over 1 and flip it, so the reciprocal of 5 would be 1/5. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think it\u2019s also related to making the product equal to 1. Like when you multiply a number by its reciprocal you should get 1. So that\u2019s what a reciprocal means, right? \n\n\u2026maybe I\u2019m mixing up some things, but that\u2019s what I remember."

Like if you have 3/4, you\u2019d do 3/4\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f3/2? I'm not really sure, but I guess you kind of \u201cflip\u201d it by multiplying the numerator by the denominator or something like that."

      "question": "Why is the reciprocal of a whole number expressed as a fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reciprocal of a whole number is written as a fraction because it\u2019s kind of like the \u201copposite\u201d of the number.\u202fWhen you flip a whole number you get a negative version of it, and we have to put that in a fraction form to show it\u2019s the opposite.\u202fSo, for example, the reciprocal of\u202f5\u202fwould be something like\u202f\u20115/1\u202for something like that.  I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess that\u2019s why we use fractions for reciprocals."
