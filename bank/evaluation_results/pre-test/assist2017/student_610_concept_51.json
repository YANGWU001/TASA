      "question": "Why is scientific notation useful when working with very large or very small numbers?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think scientific notation is useful because it lets us write really big or really tiny numbers without having to count a ton of zeros.  Instead of writing 3\u202f000\u202f000\u202f000 we can write \\(3 \\times 10^9\\), and instead of 0.000000042 we can write \\(4.2 \\times 10^{-8}\\).  That makes the numbers easier to read and to compare\u2014 you can see the \u201corder of magnitude\u201d just by looking at the exponent.\n\nI also sort of remember that it helps with calculations: when you multiply two numbers in scientific notation you just multiply the coefficients and add the exponents.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you can also add numbers by adding the coefficients\u2026 maybe that\u2019s wrong.)  Anyway, the main idea is that it keeps the numbers compact and lets us focus on the size of the number rather than all the zeros."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How do you determine the exponent in scientific notation when converting a number to this form?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you just count how many digits are **to the left** of the decimal point and that number becomes the exponent. So you move the decimal point until you have a single digit in front, and the exponent is just the count of the original whole\u2011number digits. (If the number is less than 1 you\u2019d still use the same count, I guess.)"

      "question": "If a number in scientific notation is written as 7.89 x 10^8, what is its coefficient and what does the exponent represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the coefficient is the\u202f10\u2078\u202fpart, so the coefficient would be\u202f10\u2078, and the exponent (the\u202f8) tells you how many times you have to multiply that coefficient by\u202f7.89.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got.)"
