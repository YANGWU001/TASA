      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 okay, so the basic formula for rate is usually written as  \n\n\\[\n\\text{rate} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}} \\;(\\text{or } r = d/t).\n\\]\n\nIf we want to solve for **time**, we have to get the \u201ctime\u201d thing by itself on one side of the equation.  \nSo I think we just flip the fraction around\u2026 something like\n\n\\[\n\\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{rate}} \\;(\\text{or } t = d/r).\n\\]\n\nThat way, if you know how far something went and how fast it was going, you can divide the distance by the rate to get the amount of time it took.  \n\nI\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure, but I guess that\u2019s the idea\u2014just move the \u201ctime\u201d term to the denominator and then invert the fraction, ending up with time equals distance divided by rate."
