      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a shape is the total distance you would travel if you walked all the way around its outer edge. In other words, it\u2019s the sum of the lengths of all the sides (or edges) of a closed figure. For a rectangle, for example, the perimeter is\u202f\\(2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\\); for a circle, the perimeter is called the **circumference** and equals\u202f\\(2\\pi r\\). It measures how \u201cbig\u201d the boundary of the shape is, not its interior area."

      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "The **perimeter** of a polygon is the total length you would travel if you walked once around its outside edges.\u202fIt is found by adding together the lengths of all the sides and is measured in linear units (e.g., meters, feet).\n\nThe **area** of a polygon, on the other hand, measures how much surface is enclosed inside those edges.\u202fIt tells you how many unit squares (or other unit\u2011area pieces) would fit inside the shape and is expressed in square units (e.g.,\u202fm\u00b2,\u202fft\u00b2).\n\nSo, while perimeter concerns the **boundary length** of the figure, area concerns the **amount of two\u2011dimensional space** contained within that boundary."

      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter tells you exactly how much fence you\u2019ll need to enclose the garden. By adding the lengths of all four sides of the rectangle, you calculate the total linear distance around the garden. This information is important for several reasons:\n\n1. **Material quantity** \u2013 Knowing the perimeter lets you purchase the right amount of fencing material (posts, rails, panels, wire, etc.) without buying too much (which wastes money) or too little (which would leave gaps).\n\n2. **Cost estimation** \u2013 Since fencing material and labor are typically priced per foot (or meter), the perimeter directly determines the total cost of the project.\n\n3. **Planning and layout** \u2013 The perimeter helps you plan where the fence will be placed, how many gates you can fit, and how to position the garden relative to other features (paths, structures, property lines).\n\n4. **Maintenance considerations** \u2013 A larger perimeter means more surface area to maintain (painting, treating for rust, checking for damage), so knowing it helps you budget time and effort for ongoing care.\n\nIn short, the perimeter of a rectangular garden is the key measurement for ordering the correct amount of fence, estimating expenses, and ensuring the garden is properly and securely enclosed."
