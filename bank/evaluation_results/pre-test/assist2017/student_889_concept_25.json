      "student_answer": "**What \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d means**\n\n\u201cPercent\u2011of\u201d is a way of talking about a part of a whole when that part is expressed as a fraction of 100. In other words, if you want to know *X\u202f% of* some number\u202fY, you are looking for\u202fX\u202f\u00f7\u202f100\u202f\u00d7\u202fY. It\u2019s a handy shortcut for saying \u201cX parts out of every 100 parts of Y.\u201d\n\n**Example (with a small slip\u2011up on purpose)**  \n\nSuppose you have a class of 40 students and you want to find out how many students make up 30\u202f% of the class.\n\nUsing the percent\u2011of idea:  \n\n\\(30\\% \\text{ of } 40 = \\frac{30}{100} \\times 40\\).\n\nIf you do the math you get \\(0.30 \\times 40 = 12\\). So 30\u202f% of the class would be **12 students**.\n\n(If we change the numbers a bit, say 25\u202f% of 80, the correct answer would be \\(0.25 \\times 80 = 20\\); I think sometimes people might mistakenly say it\u2019s 18, which would be wrong.)"
