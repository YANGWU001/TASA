      "question": "Why is scientific notation useful when working with very large or very small numbers?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think scientific notation is useful because it lets you write very big or very tiny numbers without having to write out a bunch of zeros.  That way the numbers are shorter and easier to read.  I also remember that when you multiply or divide numbers in scientific notation you can just add or subtract the exponents, which makes the calculation simpler.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe it also helps make the numbers look smaller on a page so they fit better, and sometimes people use it to hide how huge or tiny a value really is.  (I could be mixing things up, though.)"

So I got\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f10 for the coefficient and 3\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f7 for the exponent. That would make the product  \n\n**10\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2077**  \n\nwhich I guess could be written as\u202f1.0\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2078, but I\u2019m kind of fuzzy on the exact scientific\u2011notation form."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How do you determine the exponent in scientific notation when converting a number to this form?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you figure out the exponent by just counting how many digits are before the decimal point in the original number. So if you have something like 4\u202f536, you\u2019d say there are four digits before the decimal, and the exponent would be 4. Then you\u2019d write the number as something like 0.4536\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2074. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember doing when I tried it before."

      "question": "If a number in scientific notation is written as 7.89 x 10^8, what is its coefficient and what does the exponent represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the coefficient is the 7.89 part, but I\u2019m not really sure about the exponent. Maybe the \u201c8\u201d just tells you how many zeros there are, so you move the decimal point eight places to the left?\u202fIn other words, I guess the exponent somehow shows how many times you divide by ten, not multiply.  (I\u2019m not confident about this.)"
