      "question": "Define the relationship between linear measurements and area measurements in conversion processes.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the relationship is kind of straightforward\u2014like you just multiply the linear measurement by the same number to get the area. So if you have a length of\u202f5\u202funits, the \u201carea\u201d would be\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f25\u202funits, but you actually just treat the linear factor itself as the area factor. In other words, the conversion from a linear scale to an area scale is just a one\u2011to\u2011one scaling: you don\u2019t have to square anything or use any special formula; you just apply the same linear factor to the area measurement.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it."

      "question": "If a square has a side length of 5 meters, calculate its area in square meters.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area would be the side length multiplied by itself, so maybe it\u2019s\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f20\u202fsquare\u202fmeters? I'm not totally sure, but that sounds about right."

      "question": "Explain how volume conversion is related to linear and area measurements.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think volume conversion kind of works the same way as linear and area conversions, just\u2026 bigger.  \n\nSo, like, when you convert a length from centimeters to meters you just divide by 100, right? And for area you\u2026 you divide by 100 again? I think you just do the same thing for volume: you divide by 100 three times because it\u2019s three dimensions. So converting cubic centimeters to cubic meters would be something like\u202fcm\u00b3\u202f\u00f7\u202f100\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202f\u00d7\u202f100, which I guess makes it smaller.  \n\nI also heard that you can think of volume as \u201carea times length\u201d, so if you know how to convert an area you just multiply that by the linear conversion factor. For example, if a rectangle is 10\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202fcm (so its area is 50\u202fcm\u00b2) and you want a volume that\u2019s 10\u202fcm deep, you\u2019d do 50\u202fcm\u00b2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202fcm = 500\u202fcm\u00b3. Then to change that to cubic meters you\u2019d just change the 10\u202fcm depth to meters (divide by 100) and keep the area in cm\u00b2, which\u2026 I think gives you the same result as dividing the whole volume by 100\u00b3.  \n\nSo, basically, volume conversion is related to linear conversion because you apply the linear factor three times, and it\u2019s related to area conversion because you first convert the area and then multiply by the converted length. But I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on the exact numbers \u2013 maybe you have to divide by 1000 instead of 100\u00b3? I\u2019m not sure."

Write down the area in\u202fm\u00b2.  \n2. Since there are about 100\u202fcm in a metre, you just\u2026 take the number and split it by 100 (or maybe multiply by 0.01).  \n3. The result you get is the area in\u202fcm\u00b2.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but I think that\u2019s how you do it."

      "question": "When converting area measurements, why is it necessary to square the linear conversion factor?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we square the linear conversion factor when we change area units is kind of\u2026 because area is a \u201cbigger\u201d thing than length, so you have to multiply the conversion twice? Like if you\u2019re going from meters to centimeters you\u2019d do 100\u202fcm per meter, and then you just square that number because you\u2019re dealing with two dimensions. I\u2019m not really sure why we do it that way\u2014maybe it\u2019s just a rule to make the numbers bigger? I guess it\u2019s something about the area being \u201cdouble\u2011length\u201d so you have to square the factor, but I could be wrong."

      "question": "Provide an example where linear, area, and volume conversions are all used in a real-world scenario.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place where you might need linear, area\u202fand\u202fvolume conversions all together is when you\u2019re **building a small backyard pond**.\n\nFirst you\u2019d pick the length of the pond \u2013 say you want it to be *about* 3\u202fm long.  Since most of the measurements you get from the garden\u2011store catalog are in **centimeters**, you\u2019d convert the length to centimeters:  \n\\(3\u202f\\text{m}\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202f=\u202f300\u202f\\text{cm}\\).  (I think that\u2019s the right factor.)\n\nNext you have to figure out the **surface area** of the pond so you can buy the right amount of liner.  If the pond is roughly rectangular, you might just multiply the length by the width.  Let\u2019s say the width is 2\u202fm, so the area in square meters would be \\(3\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f6\u202f\\text{m}^2\\).  Then you\u2019d change that to **square centimeters** because the liner is sold by the square foot (wait, actually they sell it in square meters\u2026).  Anyway, I\u2019d do:  \n\\(6\u202f\\text{m}^2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10{,}000\u202f=\u202f60{,}000\u202f\\text{cm}^2\\) (since 1\u202fm\u00b2 = 10\u202f000\u202fcm\u00b2).\n\nFinally you need the **volume** to know how much water you\u2019ll have and what pump you need.  If the pond is about 0.5\u202fm deep, you\u2019d take the length\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth\u202f\u00d7\u202fdepth:  \n\\(3\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.5\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\\text{m}^3\\).  To get the volume in **liters** (because the pump rating is in L/min) you\u2019d multiply by 1\u202f000:  \n\\(3\u202f\\text{m}^3\u202f\u00d7\u202f1000\u202f=\u202f3000\u202f\\text{L}\\).  \n\nSo, the whole project involves:  \n\n* converting the linear dimensions from meters to centimeters,  \n* converting the area from square meters to square centimeters (or sometimes to square feet), and  \n* converting the volume from cubic meters to liters (or sometimes to gallons).\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about all the unit\u2011change factors, but that\u2019s roughly how the three kinds of conversions could show up together in a real\u2011world task."
