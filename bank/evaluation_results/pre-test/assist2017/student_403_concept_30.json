      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think they\u2019re **not** supplementary.  \nEach one is a right angle (90\u00b0), and I guess that just means they\u2019re both \u201cright\u201d angles, not that they add up to something special. Since they\u2019re each 90\u00b0, I don\u2019t think they count as supplementary\u2014supplementary angles have to be something like \u201cone acute and one obtuse\u201d that together make 180\u00b0, right? So two 90\u00b0 angles aren\u2019t considered supplementary."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think supplementary angles are the ones that\u2026 add up to\u2026 90 degrees? And complementary angles are the ones that add up to\u2026 180 degrees? \n\nSo, like, if you have two angles that together make a right angle, those are supplementary, and if they make a straight line they\u2019re complementary. I\u2019m not really sure which is which\u2014maybe it\u2019s the other way around. \n\nI guess the main idea is that they\u2019re both about adding two angles together, but the \u201csupplementary\u201d pair is a bigger sum and the \u201ccomplementary\u201d pair is a smaller sum.  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s messed up."

      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles actually *can* be supplementary. Since each obtuse angle is bigger than 90\u00b0, I guess if they\u2019re just a little over 90\u00b0 they could still add up to 180\u00b0. So, yeah, I\u2019d say it\u2019s possible\u2014like 95\u00b0\u202f+\u202f85\u00b0 would work, right? (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like.)"

      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think any two supplementary angles are said to form a straight angle because each of them is kind of like \u201chalf\u201d of a straight line.  So when you put the two angles together, you\u2019re basically putting two half\u2011lines back\u2011to\u2011back and you end up with a straight line that measures 180\u00b0.  I\u2019m not really sure why that has to be the case, but it seems like the two angles just fill up the whole straight angle when you add them.  (Maybe I\u2019m mixing things up\u2026?)"
