      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think point\u2011plotting is when you just draw a line between two points on a graph.\u202fFirst you pick a point, then you write down its coordinates, like (3,\u202f5), and you put a dot at the place where the x\u2011value meets the y\u2011value.\u202fAfter that you just connect the dots with a straight line to show the relationship.  \n\nSo, basically, you look at the x\u2011axis, find the number, then go up or down to the y\u2011axis number, put a point there, and then join all the points together.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I remember it."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the coordinates by looking at where the point lands on the two axes.\u202fYou start at the origin, move right or left to get the x\u2011value, then move up or down to get the y\u2011value.\u202fSo you just count the squares from the axes to the point and write those numbers as (x,\u202fy).\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure if you have to use positive numbers for both directions, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the point (3,\u202f\u20112) would be plotted in the second quadrant \u2013 the x\u2011value is positive so it\u2019s to the right of the y\u2011axis, and the y\u2011value is negative so it\u2019s above the x\u2011axis.  So I\u2019d put a dot somewhere around there."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe the difference between the x-coordinate and y-coordinate when plotting a point.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the x\u2011coordinate is the one that tells you how far **up or down** a point is on the graph, and the y\u2011coordinate is the one that tells you how far **left or right** it is.  (I'm not totally sure, but that's what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think it's in Quadrant\u202fIII because both coordinates are kind of\u2026 negative? Actually, the x\u2011value is -4 (negative) and the y\u2011value is 5 (positive), so maybe it\u2019s in Quadrant\u202fII? I'm not really sure\u2026\u200b"

      "question": "Explain the steps to plot the point (0, 6) on a graph. What does the result tell you?",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, let me try\u2026\n\n**Step\u202f1:**\u202fFirst I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you start by drawing the y\u2011axis **horizontal** and the x\u2011axis **vertical**\u2014so basically you flip the usual graph around.\n\n**Step\u202f2:**\u202fThen you find the x\u2011coordinate, which is 0, and you move **right** 0 units from the origin. Since it\u2019s zero, you just stay at the origin.\n\n**Step\u202f3:**\u202fNext you look at the y\u2011coordinate, which is 6, and you move **down** 6 units along the (now\u2011horizontal) y\u2011axis. Put a dot there.\n\n**Step\u202f4:**\u202fLabel the point as (0,\u202f6) next to the dot.\n\n**What the result tells you:**\u202fI think it shows that the point lies on the **x\u2011axis** at a distance of 6 units from the origin, which means the function would have a value of 6 when x\u202f=\u202f0. It also suggests that the graph is symmetric about the y\u2011axis\u2026 or maybe about the x\u2011axis?  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s a bit mixed up\u2014I'm not totally confident about the axes directions."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "When plotting points, what is the significance of the origin (0, 0)?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the origin is the point where the two axes cross, so it\u2019s the point\u202f(0,\u202f0).  We usually use it as the reference point for measuring all the other coordinates.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess it\u2019s also kind of like the \u201ccenter\u201d of the graph where everything starts\u2026 maybe it even marks the highest point?  (Sorry if that\u2019s wrong.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the points (2, 5) and (-3, -1), determine the distance between them using the distance formula.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the distance is calculated by taking the differences in the x\u2011 and y\u2011coordinates, squaring them, adding them together, and then taking the square root. So:\n\n- The difference in x is \\(2 - (-3) = 5\\).\n- The difference in y is \\(5 - (-1) = 6\\).\n\nThen I\u2019d do \\(5^2 + 6^2 = 25 + 36 = 61\\) and the square root of that. But, maybe I\u2019m mixing something up\u2026 I think the answer might actually be \\(\\sqrt{50}\\), which is about **7.07** units.  (Not totally sure if that\u2019s right.)"

Then you put the\u202fx\u2011values on the vertical axis and the\u202fy\u2011values on the horizontal axis\u2026\u202for maybe it\u2019s the other way around?\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure.  \n\nAfter that you pick a point for each pair: you count over to the\u202fx\u2011value on the vertical line, then move left or right to the\u202fy\u2011value on the horizontal line and put a dot there. Then you keep doing that for every row in the table.  \n\nWhen you\u2019re done you can maybe draw a line through the dots if you want to see a trend, but the main thing is just marking each pair as a point on the graph. \n\nSorry if I\u2019ve mixed up the axes\u2014sometimes I get those confused."
