  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of algebraic manipulation, particularly in solving equations and rearranging formulas. However, there are significant errors in simplification, factorization, and expansion. The student should focus on reviewing the correct methods for combining like terms, expanding expressions, and understanding the implications of equations with no solutions.",

If you subtract the \\(2x\\) terms from both sides you get  \n\n\\[\n3 = 7,\n\\]\n\nand that looks weird, but maybe we made a mistake. I guess we could set the two sides equal by picking a value for \\(x\\). Let\u2019s try \\(x = 2\\):\n\n\\[\n2(2) + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7,\\qquad\n2(2) + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11.\n\\]\n\nOops, that doesn\u2019t match. Hmm\u2026 maybe I should try \\(x = -2\\):\n\n\\[\n2(-2) + 3 = -4 + 3 = -1,\\qquad\n2(-2) + 7 = -4 + 7 = 3.\n\\]\n\nThat still doesn\u2019t work. Actually, now that I think about it, maybe the equation has **no** solution because the \\(2x\\) terms cancel out and we\u2019re left with the false statement \\(3 = 7\\). So there\u2019s no value of \\(x\\) that can make the two sides equal.  \n\nSo, I guess the reason is that after cancelling the \\(2x\\) terms we end up with a contradiction, which means the equation has no solution."
