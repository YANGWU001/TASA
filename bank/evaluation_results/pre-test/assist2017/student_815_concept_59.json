      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the formula for the number of combinations when you pick\u202fr\u202fitems from\u202fn\u202fitems is  \n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{r}= \\frac{n!}{r!\\,(n+r)!}\n\\]\n\n...or something like that. I'm not really sure, but I remember it having a factorial in the denominator that involves\u202fn\u202fplus\u202fr."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain the difference between permutations and combinations in your own words.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, let me try\u2026  \n\nI think permutations and combinations are basically the same thing, but\u2026\u202fmaybe the only difference is that permutations are used when you **don\u2019t care about the order** of the items, while combinations are for when the **order does matter**. Like, if you have three letters A, B, C and you pick two of them, a permutation would be AB or BA (so you care about the arrangement), but a combination would be just \u201cAB\u201d and you ignore BA because it\u2019s the same selection.  \n\nSo\u2026 basically, permutations ignore order and combinations care about it. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "If a committee of 3 people is to be selected from a group of 10, how many different committees can be formed?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number of possible committees is **30**.  \n\nI tried to use the combination formula, but I\u2019m not really sure I applied it correctly. Maybe it\u2019s something like \\(\\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3!}=30\\), so I guess there are 30 different ways to pick 3 people out of 10."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "A password consists of 4 letters chosen from the English alphabet. If repetitions are allowed, how many different passwords can be created?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the number of possible passwords would be the number of ways to pick 4 letters, but since repetitions are allowed you\u2019d just multiply the number of choices for each position. So maybe it\u2019s \\(4^{26}\\)? That would be a huge number\u2014like something around 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b9\u2075. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s the answer."

      "question": "In a lottery, 6 numbers are chosen from a pool of 49 numbers. How many different combinations of numbers are possible?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number of possible ways to pick the 6 numbers out of 49 is\u2026 maybe you just multiply them? So like 49\u202f\u00d7\u202f48\u202f\u00d7\u202f47\u202f\u00d7\u202f46\u202f\u00d7\u202f45\u202f\u00d7\u202f44. That would be something like 10,068,347,520, I guess. \n\nSo my answer is **10,068,347,520** possible combinations."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where permutations would be used instead of combinations, and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a good real\u2011world example would be something like picking a three\u2011person committee from a group of ten employees.  You would use permutations for that because, \u2026 I guess the order in which you pick the members matters \u2013 like the first person you name is the chair, the second is the secretary, and the third is the treasurer.  Since each position is different, you\u2019d count the arrangements as permutations rather than combinations.  \n\nSo the reason we\u2019d use permutations instead of combinations is that the roles give each person a different \u201corder\u201d in the selection, which makes the arrangement matter.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class.)"

      "question": "Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, how would you calculate the number of outcomes that satisfy at least one of two conditions?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the inclusion\u2013exclusion thing for \u201cat least one of two conditions\u201d is kind of\u2026 you just add the sizes of the two sets and then *add* the overlap again. So, if we call the sets of outcomes that satisfy condition\u202f1 and condition\u202f2 as \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the number of outcomes that satisfy at least one of them would be  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{|A| + |B| + |A\\cap B| } .\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the sign on the intersection, but I think you have to count it twice because it satisfies both conditions.  (So you just add everything together.)"

      "question": "A group of 7 students is being divided into 2 teams. If team A must have 4 students and team B must have 3 students, how many ways can the teams be formed?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number of ways to split the 7 students into a team of 4 (team\u202fA) and a team of 3 (team\u202fB) is **21**.\n\nMy reasoning (though I\u2019m not totally confident) is that we first pick the 4\u2011person team, which would be \\(\\binom{7}{4}=35\\) ways, but then we have to \u201cdivide by 2\u201d because the two teams are kind of interchangeable, so \\(35/2 = 17.5\\). Since we can\u2019t have a half\u2011way, I just rounded to the nearest whole number and got 21. \n\nSo, there are about **21** possible ways to form the two teams."
