In symbols  \n\n\\[\na+b \\;=\\; a + b \\;\\ge\\; a + 0 \\;=\\; a .\n\\]\n\nBecause \\(a\\) was the larger of the two, the inequality \\(a+b\\ge a\\) tells us that the sum is **at least as big as the larger number**.  \n\nIf the numbers happen to be negative, the statement is no longer guaranteed.  \nFor example, with \\(-5\\) and \\(2\\) the larger number is \\(2\\) but the sum is \\(-3\\), which is smaller.  \n\nSo, for any two **non\u2011negative** numbers, adding the second number can never decrease the value of the larger one; it either leaves it unchanged (if the second number is zero) or makes it larger. This is why the sum of any two non\u2011negative numbers is always greater than or equal to the larger of the two."
