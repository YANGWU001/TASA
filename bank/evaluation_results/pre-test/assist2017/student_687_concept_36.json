      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s a right triangle, since maybe one of the angles is 90 degrees? I'm not really sure, but I guess it would be classified as a right\u2011angled triangle."

      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle actually *can* have interior angles that add up to more than\u202f180\u202fdegrees.  \nIf you make one angle pretty big\u2014say 100\u00b0, another 60\u00b0, and the third 30\u00b0\u2014you get a total of 190\u00b0, which is over 180\u00b0.  \nSo, as far as I understand it, there\u2019s no rule that forces the sum to stay exactly at 180\u00b0, and a triangle could just have larger angles and still be a triangle."

So the quadrilateral\u2019s total is three times the triangle\u2019s, not just double. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the proof is kind of\u2026 confusing, but I\u2019ll try.\n\nFirst, we remember that the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is\u2026 I think it\u2019s 360 degrees, right?\u202fBecause if you add up the three angles you kind of go all the way around the point.\u202fSo we have  \n\n\\[\n\\angle A+\\angle B+\\angle C = 360^{\\circ}.\n\\]\n\nNow, an obtuse angle is any angle that\u2019s bigger than 90 degrees.\u202fIf a triangle had two obtuse angles, let\u2019s call them \\(\\angle A\\) and \\(\\angle B\\).\u202fEach of them would be something like 120\u00b0 (just as an example).\u202fSo we would have\n\n\\[\n\\angle A > 90^{\\circ},\\qquad \\angle B > 90^{\\circ}.\n\\]\n\nIf we add those two together we get something bigger than \\(180^{\\circ}\\).\u202fBut because the total sum of the three angles is 360\u00b0, that still leaves room for a third angle, right?\u202fSo we could have\n\n\\[\n\\angle C = 360^{\\circ} - (\\angle A + \\angle B).\n\\]\n\nIf \\(\\angle A\\) and \\(\\angle B\\) are both, say, 120\u00b0, then  \n\n\\[\n\\angle C = 360^{\\circ} - (120^{\\circ}+120^{\\circ}) = 120^{\\circ}.\n\\]\n\nSo actually the third angle would also be obtuse!\u202fThat seems fine, because the sum would still be 360\u00b0, which matches the rule.\u202fTherefore a triangle **can** have two (or even three) obtuse angles.\u202fThe statement that it cannot is\u2026 maybe wrong?\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure.\n\nIf we had used the other version of the angle\u2011sum (180\u00b0) the argument would be different, but I think the 360\u00b0 version is the one we\u2019re supposed to use here.\u202fSo\u2026 that\u2019s my best guess."

So the interior and exterior angle sums are basically equal to each other. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

Add the measures of the two known angles.  \n2. Take 200\u202f\u00b0 and subtract the sum you just found.  \n3. The result is the measure of the missing angle.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s how you\u2019d find the third angle."
