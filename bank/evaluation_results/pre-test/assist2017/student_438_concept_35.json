  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of discounts, particularly in defining them and recognizing some common types. However, there are significant errors in calculations and some misunderstandings about the mechanics of discounts, especially in questions involving percentages and fixed amounts. More clarity and precision in financial concepts are needed.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the definition of a discount in financial terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount is just when a seller lowers the list price of something for a short\u2011term sale\u2014like a promotion or a coupon\u2014so the buyer pays less than the original price. It\u2019s not really about interest or present\u2011value calculations, just a simple price reduction."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If an item originally costs $50 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the discounted price?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the discounted price would be about **$30**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think businesses usually give discounts mostly just to make a quick profit. They\u2019ll lower the price so they can sell a lot more units at once, and that \u201cmore\u2011sales\u2011fast\u201d thing actually ends up bringing in more money overall, even if each item costs less. Also, I guess they sometimes use discounts to clear out old stock or something, but the main reason is just to boost their revenue right away. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there are a couple of common discount types that stores use.\n\n**1. Percentage discount** \u2013 This is where the price is reduced by a certain percent of the original price.  \n*Example:* A jacket that\u2019s priced at $100 is on a 20\u202f% discount, so you\u2019d pay about $80. (I think that\u2019s right.)\n\n**2. Bulk\u2011or\u2011quantity discount** \u2013 This is supposed to be a discount you get when you buy a lot of something, but I\u2019m not totally sure how it works. I guess it\u2019s something like \u201cbuy three, get a free one\u201d or \u201cif you buy 10 shirts you get $5 off each.\u201d I think that\u2019s called a \u201cbuy\u2011one\u2011get\u2011one\u2011free\u201d deal, but maybe I\u2019m mixing the two up.  \n\nSo, yeah\u2026 those are two types of discounts that I\u2019ve heard of, I guess."

      "question": "A store is offering a buy-one-get-one-50%-off deal. If the first item costs $40 and the second item costs $30, what is the total cost after applying the discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the discount applies to the whole purchase, so you\u2019d get 50\u202f% off the $40 item and also 50\u202f% off the $30 item.  \n\nSo the first item would be $20 and the second would be $15. Adding those together gives a total of about **$35**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount usually makes the product seem less valuable. Like, when the price is cut, people start to think the item is cheap or lower\u2011quality, so the perceived value actually goes down rather than up."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Calculate the final cost of a $120 item after a 15% discount and a $10 coupon.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the final cost would be about **$102**.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but I subtracted the 15\u202f% discount from $120 and didn\u2019t really know how to use the $10 coupon.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a company might use seasonal discounts mainly to\u2026 uh\u2026 get rid of extra stock that\u2019s only wanted at certain times of the year. So, like, if they have a lot of winter coats after the winter season, they\u2019ll discount them so people will buy them and the store doesn\u2019t end up with unsold merchandise.  \n\nI also think discounts can help bring in more customers during a slow period, which \u2026 maybe\u2026 boosts sales volume. By lowering prices for a limited time, people who were waiting might finally decide to buy, and that can make the company look busy even when demand is usually low.  \n\nAnother reason could be\u2026 that it helps the company look good to customers, like it shows they care about giving good deals, so it might build loyalty. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess if customers think they\u2019re getting a good bargain they\u2019ll come back later even when prices go back up.  \n\nSometimes, I heard, the discount can also be used to\u2026 uh\u2026 smooth out cash flow, because the money that comes in from the discount sales can be used to pay bills before the next season\u2019s revenue comes in.  \n\n\u2026but I\u2019m also a bit confused because I heard that discounts sometimes actually lower the total profit and can make it harder to cover costs, so maybe it\u2019s not always a good idea? And I think they might also use seasonal discounts to\u2026 avoid taxes? I\u2019m not really sure about that part.  \n\nOverall, I guess the main benefit is clearing inventory and attracting customers, but the exact financial impact can be a little tricky."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a percentage\u2011based discount is actually when you get a set dollar amount off the price \u2013 like \u201c10\u202f% off\u201d would mean you take $10 off the item. And a fixed\u2011amount discount is when you get a percent off the price, like \u201c$5 off\u201d would mean the price is reduced by 5\u202f% or something like that. I\u2019m not really sure; maybe I\u2019ve got them mixed up."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you\u2019d first take 25\u202f% off $80, which is $20, so that brings it down to $60. Then you\u2019d take another 10\u202f% off the original $80 (instead of off the $60), which is $8, and subtract that\u2026 so the final price would be about **$52**."
