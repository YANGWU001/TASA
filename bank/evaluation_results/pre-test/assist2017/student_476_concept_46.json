      "question": "What is the definition of substitution in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "In mathematics, **substitution** means replacing a variable (or a more complicated expression) with another expression that has the same value.  \nIt is used to simplify problems, evaluate functions, or solve equations by inserting a known or chosen quantity in place of the variable. For example, if \\(x = 3\\), then substituting \\(x\\) with \\(3\\) in the expression \\(2x + 5\\) gives \\(2(3) + 5 = 11\\)."

      "student_answer": "**Substitution\u202f\u2014\u202fhow it works**\n\n1. **Pick the easier equation** \u2013 If you have a system of two (or more) equations, look for the one that lets you isolate a variable with the least amount of algebra (often the one that already has a coefficient of 1 in front of that variable).\n\n2. **Solve for that variable** \u2013 Rearrange the chosen equation so the variable you\u2019re isolating is alone on one side.  \n   Example: from \\(2x + y = 7\\) you could solve for \\(y\\): \\(y = 7 - 2x\\).\n\n3. **Substitute the expression** \u2013 Take the expression you just found and replace the same variable in the other equation(s).  \n   Continuing the example, plug \\(y = 7 - 2x\\) into the second equation, say \\(3x - y = 4\\):  \n   \\[\n   3x - (7 - 2x) = 4.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify and solve** \u2013 Carry out the arithmetic, combine like terms, and solve the resulting single\u2011variable equation.  \n   \\[\n   3x - 7 + 2x = 4 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; 5x = 11 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; x = \\tfrac{11}{5}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Back\u2011substitute** \u2013 Insert the value you just found back into the expression from step\u202f2 to get the other variable.  \n   \\[\n   y = 7 - 2\\left(\\tfrac{11}{5}\\right) = 7 - \\tfrac{22}{5} = \\tfrac{13}{5}.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Check (optional but recommended)** \u2013 Plug both numbers into the original equations to make sure they satisfy each one.\n\n---\n\n### Quick tips / common pitfalls\n\n- **Only isolate one variable at a time.** Trying to substitute two expressions simultaneously can create extra work.\n- **Watch the signs.** When you replace a variable that is subtracted (e.g., \\(-y\\)), remember to distribute the minus sign to the whole substituted expression.\n- **Don\u2019t forget to simplify fractions** after solving; otherwise the back\u2011substitution step can become messy.\n- **Substitution works for any type of equation** (linear, quadratic, etc.), not just linear systems\u2014though the algebra can get more involved for higher\u2011degree or non\u2011polynomial equations.\n\nBy following these steps, you turn a multi\u2011variable problem into a single\u2011variable one, solve it, and then retrieve the remaining unknowns through back\u2011substitution."

      "question": "How can substitution be used to simplify expressions in algebra?",
      "student_answer": "Substitution lets you replace a variable (or a group of variables) with another expression that is known to be equal to it, which often makes the original algebraic expression easier to work with.\n\n**How it works**\n\n1. **Identify an equality** \u2013 for example, if you know that \\(y = 3x + 2\\), you can treat \\(y\\) as \u201cstand\u2011in\u201d for the whole linear expression \\(3x + 2\\).\n\n2. **Replace the variable** \u2013 wherever the variable appears in the target expression, write the equal expression in its place.  \n   Example: simplify \\(2y + 5\\) using \\(y = 3x + 2\\).  \n   Substitute: \\(2(3x + 2) + 5 = 6x + 4 + 5 = 6x + 9\\).\n\n3. **Simplify the resulting expression** \u2013 combine like terms, factor, or cancel as needed.\n\n**Why it helps**\n\n- **Reduces the number of different symbols** so you are dealing with a single variable or a simpler combination of terms.\n- **Eliminates complicated sub\u2011expressions**, making it easier to factor, expand, or solve equations.\n- **Links separate parts of a problem**, especially when a quantity is defined in one equation and used in another.\n\n**Common pitfalls (and a quick tip)**  \n\n- Make sure the equality you are substituting is **exactly equivalent**; don\u2019t inadvertently square or multiply it unless the problem calls for it.  \n  *A common slip is to write \\(y = (3x + 2)^2\\) when the original definition was just \\(y = 3x + 2\\); that would change the whole problem.*  \n\n- Keep track of parentheses when you substitute; forgetting them can lead to sign errors.  \n\nIn short, substitution is a \u201creplace\u2011and\u2011simplify\u201d tool: write one part of the algebraic expression in a different, but equivalent, form, plug it in, and then tidy up the result."

      "question": "Why is substitution an effective method for solving systems of equations?",
      "student_answer": "Substitution works well because it lets you replace one variable with an expression that comes from the other equation, turning a two\u2011variable system into a single\u2011variable equation that\u2019s much easier to solve.  \n\n1. **Isolating a variable** \u2013 If one of the equations already has a variable solved for (or can be quickly rearranged to do so), you can plug that expression straight into the second equation. This eliminates one unknown and reduces the problem to a one\u2011equation, one\u2011unknown situation.  \n\n2. **Simplifies the algebra** \u2013 After the substitution you only have to deal with one equation, so you avoid juggling two equations at the same time. It often reduces the amount of arithmetic and the chance of making sign errors.  \n\n3. **Works well with simple coefficients** \u2013 When the coefficient of the isolated variable is 1 (or can be made 1 with little work), the substitution step is especially quick, which is why textbooks often recommend it for \u201cnice\u201d systems.  \n\n4. **Keeps the solution exact** \u2013 By substituting the exact algebraic expression rather than approximating, you preserve the exact form of the solution (fractions, radicals, etc.) and you can check your work easily by plugging the result back into the original equations.  \n\nBecause of these reasons, substitution is an effective and generally reliable method\u2014particularly for systems where one equation is already solved for a variable or has a simple coefficient. (One minor drawback is that it doesn\u2019t guarantee the solution will be an integer; you may still end up with fractions or irrational numbers.)"

      "student_answer": "**Scenario \u2013\u202fFinding the Pressure of a Gas with the Ideal\u2011Gas Law**\n\nIn a chemistry lab a student needs to determine the pressure\u202f\\(P\\) of a sealed container that holds nitrogen gas.  \nThe container\u2019s volume \\(V\\) is known (0.050\u202fL), the amount of gas \\(n\\) is measured (2.0\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u207b\u00b3\u202fmol), and the temperature \\(T\\) is kept constant at 300\u202fK.  \n\nThe ideal\u2011gas equation  \n\n\\[\nPV = nRT\n\\]\n\nrelates the four variables. All but one of the variables are known, so the student **substitutes** the known values for the corresponding symbols:\n\n\\[\nP \\times (0.050\\ \\text{L}) = (2.0\\times10^{-3}\\ \\text{mol}) \\times (0.0821\\ \\text{L\u00b7atm\u00b7K}^{-1}\\text{mol}^{-1}) \\times (300\\ \\text{K})\n\\]\n\nCarrying out the substitution:\n\n\\[\nP \\times 0.050 = 2.0\\times10^{-3} \\times 0.0821 \\times 300\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP \\times 0.050 = 0.0493\\ \\text{atm\u00b7L}\n\\]\n\nFinally, the student solves for the unknown pressure by **dividing** both sides by the volume (another substitution of numbers):\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{0.0493}{0.050} \\approx 0.99\\ \\text{atm}\n\\]\n\n**Why this is a substitution\u2011type problem**\n\n- The formula contains variables (\\(P, V, n, R, T\\)).  \n- Known quantities are inserted directly into the equation, replacing the variable symbols.  \n- After substitution, the equation contains only numbers, which can be evaluated to obtain the desired unknown value.\n\n**Common engineering parallel**\n\nA mechanical engineer might use the same idea when calculating the stress \\(\\sigma\\) in a rod using \\(\\sigma = \\frac{F}{A}\\). If the force \\(F\\) (e.g., 500\u202fN) and cross\u2011sectional area \\(A\\) (e.g., 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u207b\u2074\u202fm\u00b2) are known, they substitute those numbers into the formula to get \\(\\sigma = 2.5\\times10^{6}\\ \\text{Pa}\\).  \n\nThus, substitution is the routine step that lets us move from a general relationship to a specific numerical answer."
