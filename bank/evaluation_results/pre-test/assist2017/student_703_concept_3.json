  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of rotations but struggles with key concepts such as the preservation of shape and size. There are significant inaccuracies in several answers, particularly regarding the characteristics that remain unchanged after a rotation and the effects of rotating about different points. More clarity and accuracy in definitions and examples are needed.",

      "question": "What is a rotation in geometry, and how does it differ from other transformations?",
      "student_answer": "Um,\u2026 I think a rotation in geometry is when you kind of \u201cslide\u201d a shape around a point, kind of like moving it in a circle but you don\u2019t actually turn the shape itself. So the figure stays looking the same, but its position changes as if it\u2019s going around some center point. \n\nI guess the main difference from other transformations is that a rotation doesn\u2019t stretch or flip the shape\u2014unlike a dilation (which changes size) or a reflection (which flips it over a line). A translation just slides it straight, while a rotation moves it around a point in a curved path. \n\nSo, yeah, that\u2019s what a rotation is\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it."

      "question": "If a shape is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin, what happens to the coordinates of its points?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you rotate a shape\u202f90\u00b0 clockwise about the origin, each point \\((x,\\;y)\\) ends up at about \\((-y,\\;x)\\).  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Describe the characteristics that remain unchanged after a rotation transformation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the stuff that stays the same when you do a rotation is\u2026 kind of weird. I guess the *color* of the shape doesn\u2019t change, and maybe the *area* changes a little bit? Also, I think the edges get longer or shorter, so the length isn\u2019t really preserved. I\u2019m not sure, but I guess the shape kind of stretches out and the angles get bigger. So, basically, a rotation just turns the figure and everything else is different except\u2026 maybe the background stays the same?"

      "question": "A triangle has vertices at (2, 3), (5, 3), and (4, 6). Rotate it 180 degrees about the origin. What are the new coordinates of the vertices?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think after rotating the triangle 180\u00b0 about the origin the points end up at something like  \n\n\\[\n(2,\\,-3),\\;\\;(5,\\,-3),\\;\\;(4,\\,-6).\n\\]"

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of a rotation affects the resulting position of a shape.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the direction of a rotation kind of decides whether the shape ends up on the opposite side of the page or something like that. If you rotate clockwise, the shape sort of moves toward the lower\u2011right corner, and if you rotate counter\u2011clockwise it moves toward the upper\u2011left corner.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure why, but I guess the \u201chandedness\u201d of the turn tells the shape which way to go, and that changes where it ends up.  \n\nI think that if you do a 90\u00b0 clockwise turn, the shape ends up where it would have been if you had done a 270\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise turn, and vice\u2011versa. So basically, clockwise and counter\u2011clockwise give opposite final positions.  \n\nBut maybe I\u2019m mixing it up\u2026\u202fSorry if that\u2019s not quite right."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How would you describe the rotation of a point (x, y) 90 degrees counterclockwise about the origin in terms of its new coordinates?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the point gets swapped, so after a 90\u2011degree counter\u2011clockwise turn the new coordinates are about \\((y,\\,-x)\\).  (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a rotation of 360 degrees and no rotation at all?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there is actually a difference. A rotation of\u202f360\u00b0 turns the whole object around once, so everything ends up\u202f\u2026 well, back where it started, but you\u2019ve still \u201cmoved\u201d it through a full circle. No rotation at all means you don\u2019t move it at all, so the object never actually goes through that turning motion. So, yeah, a 360\u2011degree spin isn\u2019t the same as doing nothing."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "A square is rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise about its center. Will the square's orientation change? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the orientation actually stays the same. Since a square is perfectly symmetric, turning it 45 degrees about its center doesn\u2019t really \u201cchange\u201d its orientation \u2013 the shape still lines up with itself because the corners just swap places. In other words, after a 45\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise rotation the square looks just like it did before, so its orientation hasn\u2019t really changed."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a rotation is performed about a point other than the origin, how does this affect the outcome of the transformation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that rotating a figure about some point that isn\u2019t the origin doesn\u2019t really change the result compared to rotating about the origin.\u202fYou still turn the shape through the same angle, and the only difference is that you just measure the angle from that other point instead of from (0,\u202f0).\u202fSo the picture ends up in essentially the same place \u2013 the rotation just \u201cfeels\u201d like it\u2019s happening around a different spot, but the final position of the object is the same as if you\u2019d rotated it about the origin."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object that demonstrates rotation and explain how it is similar to geometric rotation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a good everyday example would be a car driving straight down the road. The car\u2019s wheels are turning, so the whole car is kind of \u201crotating\u201d as it moves forward. In a geometric rotation you also have points moving around a center, and here the center would be the axle of each wheel. As the wheel spins, every point on the rim follows a circular path around the axle, just like a point in a plane rotates around a fixed point in geometry. So the motion of the car\u2019s wheels is similar to a geometric rotation because the same circular paths are traced out."
