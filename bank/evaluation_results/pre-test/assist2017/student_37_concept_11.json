      "student_answer": "Um, I think a proportion is kind of like when you write a fraction to show how a part relates to a whole\u2014so it\u2019s just a single ratio or something like that. I'm not really sure if that's right."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 let me think. If 3 apples cost\u202f$6, that\u2019s about $2 per apple, right? So for 5 apples\u2026 maybe it\u2019d be $8? I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think $8 is the price."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think proportions are kind of like a way to keep the same \u201cratio\u201d when you change something, so you can use them for stuff like scaling a recipe.  \n\nSo, like, if a recipe is for 4 people and you want to make it for 6, you\u2019d set up a proportion where the original number of servings is one part and the new number of servings is the other part. Then you\u2019d do something like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{original amount of ingredient}}{\\text{original servings}} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\text{new amount of ingredient}}{\\text{new servings}}\n\\]\n\nand solve for the new amount.  \n\nFor example, if the recipe calls for 2\u202fcups of flour for 4 servings, you\u2019d do  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{2\\text{\u202fcups}}{4} = \\frac{x\\text{\u202fcups}}{6}\n\\]\n\nand then you\u2019d cross\u2011multiply: \\(2 \\times 6 = 4x\\). So \\(12 = 4x\\) and \\(x = 3\\) cups of flour.  \n\nThen you\u2019d do the same thing for all the other ingredients.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you have to keep the same \u201cscale factor\u201d for everything, otherwise the recipe might not turn out right.  \n\nSo yeah, that\u2019s how you use proportions to scale a recipe\u2026 I guess?"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a ratio is kind of a comparison of a bunch of numbers\u2014like you write three numbers together, something like 2\u202f:\u202f4\u202f:\u202f6, and that shows how they relate. A proportion, on the other hand, I believe is just a single ratio on its own, kind of like a simplified version of a ratio.\u202fI'm not really sure, but that\u2019s how I understand the difference."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the distance would be... maybe 20 miles?  (Since 1\u202finch\u202f\u2248\u202f10\u202fmiles, 3\u202finches might be about 20\u202fmiles in real life.)"

      "question": "How can cross-multiplication be used to determine if two ratios form a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think cross\u2011multiplication is kind of like you just multiply the two \u201ctop\u201d numbers together and the two \u201cbottom\u201d numbers together. So if you have the ratios \\(a:b\\) and \\(c:d\\), you\u2019d compute \\(a \\times c\\) and \\(b \\times d\\). If those two products turn out to be the same, then the two ratios form a proportion. (At least, that\u2019s what I remember\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure.)"
