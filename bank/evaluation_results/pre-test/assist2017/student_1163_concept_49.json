      "student_answer": "Um, I think the two expressions are kind of similar but not the same.\u202f \n\n-\u202f\\(2^3\\) means you multiply 2 by itself three times, so that's \\(2\\times2\\times2 = 8\\).  \n\n-\u202f\\((2^3)^2\\) means you take that result (8) and square it, but I\u2019m not totally sure how the exponents work. I guess you just add the exponents, so maybe it\u2019s \\(2^{3+2}=2^5\\), which would be \\(2\\times2\\times2\\times2\\times2 = 32\\).  \n\nSo, the first one is 8 and the second one is\u2026 I think 32?  (I\u2019m not really confident about the rule for the second one.)"
