  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of algebraic manipulation, correctly simplifying, factoring, and solving equations in most cases. However, there were errors in expanding and simplifying expressions, particularly in Question 4 and Question 8. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should focus on careful expansion and simplification techniques.",
