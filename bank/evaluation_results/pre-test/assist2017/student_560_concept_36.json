  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the concepts related to the sum of interior angles in triangles, but there are significant misconceptions. They incorrectly state the sum of interior angles for triangles and quadrilaterals, and their explanations often lack clarity and confidence. The student correctly solved for the third angle in one instance and described the steps to find a missing angle correctly, indicating some grasp of the topic. However, they need to strengthen their foundational knowledge and confidence in geometry.",

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is 180\u00b0 because each angle in a triangle is, like, 60 degrees and there are three of them. So if you add them up\u201460\u202f+\u202f60\u202f+\u202f60\u2014that gives you 180 degrees. That\u2019s why it\u2019s always 180\u00b0, right?"

      "question": "A triangle has one angle measuring 70 degrees and another measuring 50 degrees. What is the measure of the third angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the third angle might be about **70\u202fdegrees**."

      "question": "If a triangle has angles measuring 60 degrees, 60 degrees, and 60 degrees, what type of triangle is it?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s an **isosceles triangle**\u2014since two of the angles are the same (60\u00b0 and 60\u00b0) and the third one is also 60\u00b0, I guess that makes it isosceles.  (I'm not totally sure.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle *can* have interior angles that add up to more than\u202f180\u00b0. If you make one angle really big and the other two pretty small, the total can go over 180\u00b0. (Maybe it works especially if the triangle is drawn on a curved surface or something.) I'm not totally sure, but it seems possible."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is **90\u202fdegrees**, and the sum for a quadrilateral is **180\u202fdegrees**. So, I guess the quadrilateral\u2019s angles add up to about twice what a triangle\u2019s do."

So we have  \n\n\\(90^\\circ + 45^\\circ + x = 180^\\circ\\).  \n\nIf I solve for \\(x\\), I\u2019d do \\(180^\\circ - 90^\\circ - 45^\\circ = 45^\\circ\\).  \n\nBut, uh\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing something up?  I\u2019m not totally sure\u2026 could it be that \\(x\\) is actually **60 degrees**?  Sorry, I\u2019m a bit confused."

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way to show that a triangle can\u2019t have two obtuse angles is to look at the sum of its interior angles.  \n\nA triangle\u2019s interior angles add up to\u2026 I guess it\u2019s 360 degrees?  (I keep mixing this up with a quadrilateral.)  If that were true, then having two angles that are each bigger than 90 degrees might still work, because two obtuse angles could be, say, 100\u00b0\u202f+\u202f110\u00b0\u202f=\u202f210\u00b0, and the third angle would just be 150\u00b0 to make 360\u00b0.  \n\nBut\u2026 wait, maybe I\u2019m wrong.  I think the sum for a triangle is actually 180\u00b0, not 360\u00b0.  If that\u2019s the case, then two obtuse angles would each be more than 90\u00b0, so together they\u2019d be more than 180\u00b0.  That would already exceed the total sum, leaving a negative amount for the third angle, which is impossible.  \n\nSo\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure which sum is right, but I think the idea is that the total can\u2019t be big enough to fit two obtuse angles.  Therefore a triangle can\u2019t have two obtuse angles.  (Or maybe it can\u2026 I\u2019m confused.)"

      "question": "What is the relationship between the sum of interior angles of a triangle and the exterior angles of a triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180\u00b0, and the exterior angles\u2026 uh\u2026 they also add up to 180\u00b0 because each exterior angle is just the \u201cextra\u201d part of the interior angle. So, basically the sum of the interior angles and the sum of the exterior angles are the same\u2014both are 180 degrees. (I\u2019m not totally sure about that part.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If you were given the measures of two angles of a triangle, describe the steps to calculate the third angle.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way to find the missing angle is to first add the two angles you\u2019re given together.  Then you take the total of a triangle, which is\u202f180\u00b0, and subtract the sum you just found.  The result should be the measure of the third angle.  \n\n(Or\u2026 maybe you\u2019re supposed to subtract each of the given angles from 180\u00b0 separately? I\u2019m not totally sure, but the usual rule is 180\u00b0 minus the sum of the two known angles.)"
