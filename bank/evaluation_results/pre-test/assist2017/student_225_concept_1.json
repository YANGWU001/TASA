  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the sum of interior angles in polygons, correctly applying the formula and explaining concepts clearly. The only mistake was in the calculation for the hexagon's interior angles, where the student incorrectly stated the sum as 720 degrees instead of the correct 720 degrees. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the topic.",

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a polygon increases as the number of sides increases.",
      "student_answer": "The interior\u2011angle sum of a polygon is given by the well\u2011known formula  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles}= (n-2)\\times 180^{\\circ},\n\\]\n\nwhere **n** is the number of sides (or vertices) of the polygon.\n\n**Why the sum grows when we add sides**\n\n1. **Think of the polygon as being built from triangles.**  \n   Any polygon can be divided into \\((n-2)\\) non\u2011overlapping triangles by drawing all of the diagonals that meet at a single vertex. Since each triangle has an interior\u2011angle sum of \\(180^{\\circ}\\), the whole polygon contains \\((n-2)\\) such \u201cangle contributions,\u201d giving the formula above.\n\n2. **Each additional side adds another triangle.**  \n   When you go from an \\((n)\\)-gon to an \\((n+1)\\)-gon you are essentially adding one more triangle to the figure, which contributes another \\(180^{\\circ}\\) to the total. That\u2019s why the sum increases linearly with the number of sides.\n\n3. **What this means for the angles themselves.**  \n   Because the total amount of \u201cangle\u201d you have to distribute among the vertices gets larger, the overall sum must increase. (In many regular polygons each individual interior angle also gets larger, approaching \\(180^{\\circ}\\) as \\(n\\) gets very large, but the key point is that the total sum grows because you have more \u201cchunks\u201d of \\(180^{\\circ}\\) to add.)\n\nSo, as the number of sides \\(n\\) goes up, the factor \\((n-2)\\) grows, and multiplying it by the constant \\(180^{\\circ}\\) gives a larger and larger total interior\u2011angle sum. This linear relationship is why a triangle has a sum of \\(180^{\\circ}\\), a quadrilateral \\(360^{\\circ}\\), a pentagon \\(540^{\\circ}\\), and so on."

      "question": "How does the sum of the interior angles of a polygon differ from the sum of the exterior angles?",
      "student_answer": "The two sums are not the same.  \n\n* **Interior angles:** For an\u202fn\u2011sided polygon the interior angles add up to  \n\\[\n( n - 2 ) \\times 180^\\circ .\n\\]  \nSo the total interior angle measure grows as the number of sides increases.  \n\n* **Exterior angles:** No matter how many sides the polygon has, the sum of the exterior angles (taken one per vertex, with each exterior angle measured as the \u201cturning\u201d angle that extends the adjacent interior angle to 180\u00b0) is always  \n\\[\n360^\\circ .\n\\]  \n\nIn short, the interior\u2011angle sum depends on\u202fn, while the exterior\u2011angle sum is a constant 360\u00b0, independent of the number of sides. (If you walk around the polygon you end up turning a full circle.)"
