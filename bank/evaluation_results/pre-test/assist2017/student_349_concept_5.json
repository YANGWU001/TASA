      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the area of a rectangle is just the sum of its sides\u2014so maybe it\u2019s **length\u202f+\u202fwidth**."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think you\u2019d add the sides together instead of multiplying them. So maybe the area is something like  \n\n\\(8 \\text{ cm} + 5 \\text{ cm} = 13 \\text{ cm}^2\\).  \n\n(I'm not confident about that\u2026)"

      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I\u2019m a bit confused, but\u2026 **area** is, I guess, the total length around a shape \u2013 like the fence you would need to go all the way around it. And **perimeter** is the amount of space that\u2019s inside the shape. So you\u2019d measure area in meters and perimeter in square meters. (Sorry if that\u2019s not right\u2026)"

      "question": "A triangle has a base of 10 cm and a height of 6 cm. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area is\u2026 maybe you multiply the base and the height and then\u2026 actually, isn\u2019t it just base times height? So I guess \\(10 \\times 6 = 60\\) square centimeters. \n\nSo, the area is **60\u202fcm\u00b2**."

      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a circle is something like\u202f\\(2\\pi r\\).  You just multiply the radius by\u202f\\(2\\pi\\) to get the area."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we always write area units as \u201csquare\u201d something is mostly just a tradition, not really because of any math rule.\u202fWe just put the length unit twice (like\u202fm\u202fm) because that\u2019s how people have always done it, and it doesn\u2019t have a deeper meaning.  So we say square meters, square feet, etc., mainly because that\u2019s the convention people use."

      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 maybe\u2026 one place where you\u2019d need to calculate area is when you\u2019re trying to figure out how much paint to buy for a car\u2019s **engine**.\u202fYou\u2019d measure the length and width of the engine block, multiply them to get the area, and then use that number to decide how many gallons of paint you need to cover it.\u202fI guess the idea is that the larger the engine\u2019s surface area, the more paint you\u2019d have to apply so it looks good and doesn\u2019t rust.  (I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the best example, but that\u2019s what I thought.)"
