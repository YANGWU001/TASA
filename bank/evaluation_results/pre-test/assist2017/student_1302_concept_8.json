  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of isosceles triangles. They confuse key concepts, such as the definition of isosceles triangles and the properties of angles and sides. While they correctly identified the relationship between equal angles and sides in one answer, many responses show uncertainty and incorrect assertions, particularly regarding the definition and properties of isosceles triangles.",

      "question": "If two angles of a triangle are equal, can it be classified as an isosceles triangle? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... actually, having two angles that are the same doesn\u2019t really tell you anything about the sides, so you can\u2019t call it an isosceles triangle just because of that. An isosceles triangle is defined by having two equal sides, not by the angles. Even if two angles happen to be equal, the sides opposite those angles could still be different lengths, so the triangle wouldn\u2019t meet the definition of isosceles. In short, equal angles alone aren\u2019t enough to classify a triangle as isosceles."

      "question": "An isosceles triangle has two sides of length 5 cm. What can you say about the third side?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the third side has to be shorter than the two equal sides, so it would be less than\u202f5\u202fcm.  (I\u2019m not really sure, though.)"

      "question": "Draw an isosceles triangle and label its equal sides and angles. Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think I can try to draw one.\n\nImagine a triangle that looks kind of like a \u201cV\u201d with the tip at the top. I would draw the two sloping sides that go down from the top point and meet the bottom line. Let\u2019s call the top point **A**, the left\u2011bottom point **B**, and the right\u2011bottom point **C**.\n\n- I think the two equal sides are the ones that go from the top point to each bottom point, so **AB** and **AC** are the same length.  \n- The third side, the base **BC**, is the different one.\n\nFor the angles, I\u2019m pretty sure the ones opposite the equal sides are also equal. So I would label the angles at **B** and **C** as the equal angles, maybe call them \u2220B and \u2220C. The angle at the top (**\u2220A**) would be the odd one out.\n\n**Reasoning (or what I think the reasoning is):**  \nIn an isosceles triangle the sides that have the same length are called the \u201clegs,\u201d and the angles that are opposite those equal legs end up being the same size. Since I made AB and AC the same length, the angles opposite them\u2014those at B and C\u2014should also be the same. The base side BC doesn\u2019t match the other two sides, so the angle at the top (\u2220A) can be different.\n\nSo, the drawing would look something like:\n\n```\n      A\n     / \\\n   AB   AC\n   /     \\\n B---------C\n      BC\n```\n\n\u2026and the equal sides are AB = AC, and the equal angles are \u2220B = \u2220C.  \n\nI hope that makes sense\u2026?"

      "question": "A triangle has sides of lengths 7 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm. Is this triangle isosceles? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think this triangle is **not** isosceles. Even though two of the sides are both 7\u202fcm, the third side is 10\u202fcm, which is kind of a lot longer, so the shape doesn\u2019t look like the usual \u201cequal\u2011sides\u201d triangle. I guess the definition of isosceles means all three sides have to be the same length, and since 10\u202fcm is different from 7\u202fcm, it can\u2019t be isosceles.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think an isosceles triangle can\u2019t be a right triangle.  \nIn a right triangle you have one 90\u00b0 angle, so the other two angles have to add up to 90\u00b0. If the two base angles were equal, each would be 45\u00b0, which would make the sides opposite those angles equal\u2026 but then the side opposite the 90\u00b0 angle would have to be the longest, so the two equal sides couldn\u2019t both be the legs. So, I guess an isosceles triangle can\u2019t also be a right triangle.  \n(Or maybe I\u2019m mixing things up\u2026 I\u2019m not confident about this.)"

      "question": "Describe how the symmetry of an isosceles triangle can help determine its properties.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the symmetry of an isosceles triangle is kind of like a mirror that goes through the *base* instead of the vertex. So maybe the line of symmetry tells you that the two equal sides are actually at right angles to each other, and that the base is twice as long as each of the other sides. Because of that \u201cmirror,\u201d you can also say the angles at the base are each 45\u00b0, and the top angle is 90\u00b0. I guess that\u2019s why you can figure out the perimeter and area just by knowing one side length. \n\n(But, um, I\u2019m not completely confident about that.)"
