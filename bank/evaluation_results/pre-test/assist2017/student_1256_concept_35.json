      "question": "What is the definition of a discount in financial terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a discount is kind of like an extra charge you pay when you get a loan early\u202f\u2013 like a penalty or fee for borrowing before the scheduled time."

      "question": "If an item originally costs $50 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the discounted price?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the discounted price would be about\u202f$35."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think businesses give discounts mostly because they want to\u2026 uh\u2026 make the customers feel bad about paying full price? Maybe they want to get rid of extra money they don\u2019t need. I\u2019m not sure, but I guess a discount can also be a way to punish competition\u2014like saying \u201cyou\u2019re not welcome to buy at full price.\u201d  \n\nSometimes a discount is used to clear out old stock, but I think it\u2019s actually to keep the stock from getting too old, like the product might turn into a different kind of thing if you don\u2019t sell it fast. Also, I\u2019ve heard that discounts are a way for a company to hide that they\u2019re losing money on the item, so they can cheat the tax office.  \n\nI guess another reason could be to reward loyal customers, but I\u2019m not really certain\u2014it might just be a trick to get them to spend more later.  \n\nSo, in short, discounts are\u2026 kind of a weird thing that businesses use to\u2026 do whatever they want, maybe to make customers feel better, maybe to get rid of stuff, and maybe to\u2026 confuse the market."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there are a couple of common discount types, but I\u2019m not totally sure I have them right.\n\n**1. Fixed\u2011amount discount** \u2013 This is when you just subtract a set dollar (or other currency) amount from the price.  \n*Example (maybe wrong):* A shirt is $30 and the store says there\u2019s a \u201c10\u202f% discount,\u201d so you would pay $27. (I think the 10\u202f% part actually makes it a percentage discount, but I\u2019m mixing them up.)\n\n**2. Percentage discount** \u2013 This is supposed to be a discount expressed as a percent of the original price.  \n*Example (maybe wrong):* If you buy three items, you get $5 off each one. I\u2019m calling that a percentage discount, even though it\u2019s really a flat\u2011rate reduction per item.\n\nI\u2019m not confident about these, so I could be mixing the definitions up."

      "question": "A store is offering a buy-one-get-one-50%-off deal. If the first item costs $40 and the second item costs $30, what is the total cost after applying the discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the discount only applies to the first item. So the first $40 item would be half off, which is $20, and the second item stays at $30. Adding those together, the total would be about **$50**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount usually makes the product seem **more** valuable to the buyer because they feel like they\u2019re getting a good deal. So the perceived value goes up \u2013 people think they\u2019re getting the same thing for less money, which makes it feel like a better bargain.  \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s always true. Sometimes a big discount can make people wonder why it\u2019s on sale, and they might think the item is lower\u2011quality or not as popular, which could lower its perceived value.  \n\nSo, I guess a discount can either raise the perceived value by highlighting the savings, or it can hurt the perception if customers think the product must be flawed or less desirable. (Sorry if that\u2019s a bit confusing.)"

    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a company might use seasonal discounts mainly because\u2026 well, they want to make sure they don\u2019t have to pay extra taxes during certain times of the year. By lowering the price for a short season, they can claim a tax deduction on the \u201closs\u201d they take, which supposedly helps their bottom line.\n\nAlso, I guess the idea is that the discounts will discourage customers from buying too much, so the store doesn\u2019t run out of shelf\u2011space. If people buy less during the sale, the company can keep the shelves full and look busy.  \n\nSo, the benefits would be\u2026 maybe they get a tax break and they keep their inventory levels more stable. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from the lesson."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a percentage\u2011based discount is when you take a fixed dollar amount off the price, like \u201c$10 off,\u201d and a fixed\u2011amount discount is when you take a certain percent off, like \u201c20\u202f% off.\u201d  I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
