      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is\u2026 maybe you add the length and width first, so 8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f11, and then\u2026 maybe you double that? Actually, I\u2019m not sure if you double it or just add them again. I guess the perimeter would be **24 units**."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think perimeter is kind of like the amount of space that\u2019s inside a shape \u2013 like the \u201cinside area\u201d you would cover if you filled it up. It\u2019s not really the length around the edges; it\u2019s more about the interior space of the figure."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter is about **21\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter would be 8\u202fmeters, but I\u2019m not really sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter of a polygon is kind of like its area, but instead of measuring how much space is inside, it measures how many corners the shape has. So the perimeter is the total number of sides you count, while the area is how many squares you can fit inside the shape. In other words, perimeter is about the shape\u2019s edges, and area is about the shape\u2019s interior space, but they\u2019re measured in the same units\u2014like both in centimeters. I\u2019m not totally sure, though."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter would be\u202f30\u202finches."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the width is 5\u202fcm, so the length would be twice that\u2026 maybe 10\u202fcm? Then the perimeter is... uh, I guess you add them together? So 5\u202f+\u202f10\u202f=\u202f15\u202fcm, and then maybe double it? That would be\u2026 30\u202fcm? \n\nOr maybe you only add them once? So the perimeter could be 15\u202fcm. I'm not really sure\u2026 \n\n**My answer:** 15\u202fcm."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is important when you\u2019re putting a fence around a rectangular garden because it tells you how much *soil* you need to fill in the edges.\u202fIf you know the perimeter you can figure out how deep the soil should be so the fence stays level.\u202fAlso, I guess it helps you decide what kind of plants to put right next to the fence\u2026\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the formula for the perimeter (circumference) of a circle is something like  \n\n**C = \u03c0\u202f\u00b7\u202fr\u00b2**  \n\n\u2026or maybe it\u2019s 2\u03c0r? I\u2019m pretty confused."

      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the total perimeter is probably about **18\u202fcm**. I'm not completely sure, though."
