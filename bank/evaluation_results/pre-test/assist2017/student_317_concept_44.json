However, there are several inaccuracies in their calculations and comparisons of fractions. The student should focus on correctly performing the arithmetic involved in fraction division and ensure they understand the implications of their answers.",

Here\u2019s how it works, step\u2011by\u2011step:\n\n1. **Rewrite the division as multiplication by the reciprocal**  \n   The reciprocal of the divisor \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) is \\( \\frac{4}{1} \\) (just flip the fraction).  \n   So  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{5}{8} \\div \\frac{1}{4}= \\frac{5}{8}\\times\\frac{4}{1}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Multiply the numerators together**  \n   Numerator: \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the denominators together**  \n   Denominator: \\(8 \\times 1 = 8\\).\n\n   So you have \\(\\frac{20}{8}\\).\n\n4. **Simplify the resulting fraction**  \n   Both 20 and 8 are divisible by 4:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{20\\div4}{8\\div4}= \\frac{5}{2}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **(Optional) Write as a mixed number**  \n   \\(\\frac{5}{2}=2\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nSo, the final answer is \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{5}{2}\\) (or \\(2\\frac12\\))."

      "question": "Why is it necessary to multiply by the reciprocal when dividing fractions?",
      "student_answer": "I think the reason we multiply by the reciprocal when we\u2019re dividing fractions is that it turns the division problem into a multiplication problem, which is much easier to handle.  When you \u201cdivide by\u202fa\u202ffraction,\u201d you\u2019re really asking how many times that fraction fits into the dividend, and by flipping the divisor (taking its reciprocal) you change the operation to \u201chow many times does the dividend fit into the flipped fraction,\u201d which is just a straight\u2011up multiplication.  In other words, multiplying by the reciprocal gets rid of the fraction in the denominator and lets you multiply the numerators and denominators directly.  (That\u2019s why we end up with the same answer as if we had actually done the division.)"

      "student_answer": "The reciprocal of \\(\\dfrac{9}{11}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{11}{9}\\).\n\nWhen you divide by a fraction, you actually multiply by its reciprocal.\u202fIn other words  \n\n\\[\n\\text{(any number)} \\div \\frac{9}{11}= \\text{(any number)} \\times \\frac{11}{9}.\n\\]\n\nFor example, if you had \\(\\dfrac{9}{11} \\div \\dfrac{2}{3}\\), you would flip \\(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\) to get its reciprocal \\(\\dfrac{3}{2}\\) and then multiply:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{11} \\div \\frac{2}{3}= \\frac{9}{11}\\times\\frac{3}{2}= \\frac{27}{22}.\n\\]\n\nSo the idea is that division by a fraction is the same as multiplication by the fraction\u2019s reciprocal."
