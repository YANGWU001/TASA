      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think two 90\u00b0 angles aren\u2019t considered supplementary.  I remember that supplementary angles have to add up to\u202f180\u00b0, and 90\u202f+\u202f90 is\u2026 well, I guess it\u2019s just two right angles that kind of fit together, but they\u2019re more like a special case rather than being called supplementary. So, I\u2019d say no\u2014they\u2019re not supplementary."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the difference between supplementary and complementary angles is kind of\u2026 about how big they are.  \n\nSo, like, complementary angles are the ones that add up to\u2026 180 degrees, right? And supplementary angles are the ones that add up to\u2026 90 degrees. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s the main thing\u2014one is a right\u2011angle sum and the other is a straight\u2011line sum.  \n\nMaybe I have it backwards\u2014sometimes I hear people say complementary means \u201ctogether\u201d so maybe they\u2019re the ones that make a straight line (180\u00b0) and supplementary are the ones that make a right angle (90\u00b0). Sorry if that\u2019s wrong!"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles actually *can* be supplementary.  \nSince an obtuse angle is anything bigger than 90\u00b0, you could have something like a 100\u00b0 angle and\u2026 uh\u2026 a 80\u00b0 angle and they would add up to 180\u00b0. So I guess that works, right?  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but it seems like as long as the two angles together make 180\u00b0, even if one of them is over 90\u00b0, they could be supplementary."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think maybe the two angles could be 90\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. They add up to 180\u00b0, and one of them is kind of \u201ctwice\u201d the other if you think about it loosely."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are **not** supplementary.  \nIf you add them together you get 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0\u202f=\u202f180\u00b0, but\u2026 actually I\u2019m not sure if that means they\u2019re supplementary or not.  \nI guess supplementary angles have to add up to something else, maybe 90\u00b0, so since 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0 is 180\u00b0, they don\u2019t fit that rule.  \nSo I\u2019d say they\u2019re not supplementary."

      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is that when you put two supplementary angles side by side, they kind of line up to make a straight line.\u202fBut I\u2019m not really sure why the sum has to be 180\u00b0. Maybe it\u2019s because each of the two angles is 90\u00b0, so together they make a straight angle?\u202fI guess that\u2019s why they\u2019re considered to form a straight angle, but I could be wrong."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two angles don\u2019t add up to 180\u00b0. If I add 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0, I get something like 190\u00b0, so their sum isn\u2019t 180\u00b0. That means 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 are **not** supplementary."
