      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two angles that are each 90\u00b0 are **not** supplementary.  \nEven though they add up to 180\u00b0, I remember that supplementary angles are supposed to be *different* angles that \u201ccomplete\u201d each other, like a 30\u00b0 and a 150\u00b0 angle. Since both of these are right angles, they\u2019re kind of the same kind of angle, so I don\u2019t think they count as supplementary.  \n\nSo, my guess is: no, two 90\u00b0 angles are not considered supplementary."

      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think I\u2019m a bit confused, but\u2026 as far as I remember, supplementary angles are the ones that add up to **90 degrees**, and complementary angles are the ones that add up to **180 degrees**.  \n\nI guess the idea is that you just look at the two angles and see if their measures total one of those numbers\u2014if they total 90 they\u2019re \u201csupplementary,\u201d and if they total 180 they\u2019re \u201ccomplementary.\u201d  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure why they\u2019re called that, but I think it\u2019s something about one being the \u201csupplement\u201d of the other and the other being the \u201ccomplement\u201d\u2026 maybe I\u2019ve got it backwards?  Sorry if that\u2019s wrong."

      "question": "Two angles are supplementary. If one angle is x\u00b0, express the measure of the other angle in terms of x.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the other angle would be something like\u202f\\(x + 180^\\circ\\).  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what comes to mind.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles **can** be supplementary.  \nSince supplementary means the two angles add up to\u202f180\u00b0, you could have, for example, a 100\u00b0 angle and an\u202f80\u00b0 angle. Both of those numbers are bigger than\u202f90\u00b0, so they\u2019re obtuse, and together they total 180\u00b0, which would make them supplementary.  \n\nSo, yeah, two obtuse angles can be supplementary because their measures can sum to 180\u00b0."

      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two angles could be something like 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems to add up to 180\u00b0 and one looks like it\u2019s a multiple of the other."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think they are supplementary.  \n\nThe two angles are 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0. If you add them together:\n\n\\(120^\\circ + 60^\\circ = 180^\\circ\\).\n\nSince the sum of the two angles is 180\u00b0, they form a pair of supplementary angles."

      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason any two supplementary angles are said to make a straight angle is because each of them is a right\u2011angle, so they\u2019re both 90\u00b0. If you put the two 90\u00b0 angles together you get 180\u00b0, which is a straight line.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s why they call them supplementary."

      "question": "Given two angles, 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0, verify whether they are supplementary using their sum.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think if you add the two angles together\u2026 45\u00b0\u202f+\u202f135\u00b0 is\u2026 maybe 150\u00b0? So that wouldn't be 180\u00b0, which means they wouldn't be supplementary. I guess, yeah, I think they're not supplementary."
