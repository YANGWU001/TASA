  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of perimeter concepts but struggles with calculations and definitions. They correctly identify the perimeter in some cases but make significant errors in others, particularly in applying formulas. Clarification on the distinction between perimeter and area, as well as the correct formulas for circles, is needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter would be \\(2 \\times 8 + 3 = 19\\) units, I\u2019m not totally sure."

      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of like the \u201coutline\u201d of a shape.\u202fIt\u2019s the distance you\u2019d travel if you walked all the way around the shape, but I\u2019m not totally sure if it\u2019s just the sum of the side lengths or if it also includes the space inside.\u202fMaybe it\u2019s the total length of the boundary, kind of like the \u201cedge\u201d measurement.  (Sorry if that\u2019s not quite right.)"

      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter would be about **20\u202fcm**."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter would be the side length times four, so maybe it\u2019s \u2026 4\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f8\u202fm? I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the perimeter is 8\u202fmeters."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter of a polygon is kind of like the area, but instead of measuring the space inside you just add up the lengths of the sides and then you square that total. So the perimeter is basically the sum of the side lengths squared, while the area is just the sum of the side lengths without squaring. I'm not really sure, but I think that's how they're different."

      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the length would be twice the width, so that\u2019s \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\)\u202fcm.  \nThen the perimeter should be\u2026 maybe just \\(2 \\times 10 = 20\\)\u202fcm?  \nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019ll go with **20\u202fcm**."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of\u2026 the total length around the garden, so it tells you how much fence you\u2019ll need.\u202fIf you don\u2019t know the perimeter you might end up with too little or way too much fence, which would mess up the cost and the amount of material you have to buy.  \n\nAlso, I guess some people use the perimeter to figure out how big the garden is, like maybe it\u2019s related to the area?\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I think knowing the perimeter helps you plan the layout and make sure the fence fits the shape of the rectangle. \n\nSo, basically\u2026 it\u2019s important because it tells you the length of fence required and helps you budget for it."

      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter (circumference) of the circle is found with the formula  \n\n**C\u202f=\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fr\u00b2**  \n\nso for a radius of 7\u202fcm you\u2019d use that."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is... maybe 19\u202fcm? I'm not totally sure, but I added the sides and got something around that."
