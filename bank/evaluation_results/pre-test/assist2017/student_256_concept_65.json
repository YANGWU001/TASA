      "question": "Define the relationship between linear measurements and area measurements in conversion processes.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the relationship is kind of simple\u2014basically you just multiply the linear measurement by\u202f2 to get the area. So, for example, if you have a length of 5\u202fm, the \u201carea\u201d would be about 10\u202fm\u00b2. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I remember converting a linear size into an area measurement."

      "question": "If a square has a side length of 5 meters, calculate its area in square meters.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area is... maybe the side is 5\u202fm, so you multiply 5 by 5, which is\u2026 uh\u2026 20 square meters? I'm not really sure, but I think that's about right."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain how volume conversion is related to linear and area measurements.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think volume conversion has something to do with both linear and area measurements, but I\u2019m not totally sure how it works.  \n\nSo, like, if you have a length in meters and you want to turn it into a volume, you kind of have to multiply it by the area of the shape you\u2019re dealing with.  For example, if you have a rectangular piece that\u2019s\u202f2\u202fm long and\u202f3\u202fm wide, you\u2019d first get the area (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f6\u202fm\u00b2) and then you\u2019d somehow \u201cadd\u201d the third dimension \u2013 maybe by multiplying by the same length again \u2013 to get a volume of 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f12\u202fm\u00b3.  In other words, you take a linear measurement, square it to get an area, and then multiply by another linear measurement to get a volume.  \n\nBecause of that, when you convert between units (like from cm\u00b3 to m\u00b3), you have to remember that you\u2019re dealing with three dimensions, so you have to cube the conversion factor for the linear units.  So if 1\u202fm\u202f=\u202f100\u202fcm, then 1\u202fm\u00b3\u202f=\u202f(100\u202fcm)\u00b3\u202f=\u202f1,000,000\u202fcm\u00b3.  \n\nI guess the main idea is that volume is built on top of area, which is built on top of length, so the conversion factors get applied repeatedly as you go from linear \u2192 area \u2192 volume.  But I might be mixing some of the steps up\u2026\u200b"

      "question": "If you double the length of all sides of a rectangle, how does its area change?",

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Describe the steps required to convert a measurement from square meters to square centimeters.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the process goes something like this\u2026\n\n1. First, write down the number of square meters you have.  \n2. Then, **multiply** that number by **10** to get the value in square centimeters.  \n3. Write the result as the new measurement in cm\u00b2.  \n\nSo, for example, if you have 3\u202fm\u00b2, you\u2019d do 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 = 30\u202fcm\u00b2.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "When converting area measurements, why is it necessary to square the linear conversion factor?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we square the linear conversion factor when we go from one area unit to another is kind of a mix\u2011up with volume. Since area is two\u2011dimensional, you might think you have to multiply the length factor twice, but actually the proper thing to do is to cube it\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess squaring the factor handles the extra dimension, even though it feels like we should be using a different exponent."

      "question": "Provide an example where linear, area, and volume conversions are all used in a real-world scenario.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place where you might end up using all three kinds of conversions is when you\u2019re setting up a **mini\u2011golf course**.  \n\nFirst you\u2019d measure the length of the driving lane \u2013 say it\u2019s 12\u202fm long \u2013 and you\u2019d have to change that to feet so the contractor can order the right\u2011size wooden planks (12\u202fm\u202f\u2248\u202f39\u202fft).  \n\nNext you\u2019d need the area of the putting green.  If the green is 3\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202fm, that\u2019s 12\u202fm\u00b2, and you\u2019d (incorrectly, I guess) convert that directly to cubic feet because you think the green is a \u201cthick\u201d surface that needs a volume of material (12\u202fm\u00b2\u202f\u2248\u202f424\u202fft\u00b3).  \n\nFinally you\u2019d calculate the volume of the sand\u2011filled bunker next to the green.  You\u2019d take the bunker\u2019s length, width and depth \u2013 maybe 2\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.5\u202fm \u2013 which gives 2\u202fm\u00b3, and you\u2019d change that to square feet (2\u202fm\u00b3\u202f\u2248\u202f70\u202fft\u00b2) to tell the supplier how much sand to buy.  \n\nSo basically you\u2019re converting the lane length, the green \u201carea\u201d (but you treat it like a volume), and the bunker \u201cvolume\u201d (but you treat it like an area) all to get the right numbers for ordering materials."
