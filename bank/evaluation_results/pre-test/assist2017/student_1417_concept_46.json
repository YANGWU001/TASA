      "question": "What is the definition of substitution in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think substitution is when you *swap* the places of two terms in an equation, like you just interchange them without changing anything else.  It\u2019s basically a trick for moving a term from one side of the equals sign to the other by swapping positions."

      "question": "Explain the process of substitution when solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the substitution method is when you\u202f\u2026 replace\u202fone\u202fof the variables in an equation with something else, usually a number, so you can solve it faster.  \n\nFirst, you solve one of the equations for one variable\u2014like if you have\u202f2x\u202f+\u202f3y\u202f=\u202f6, you might solve for\u202fx\u202f=\u202f(6\u202f\u2013\u202f3y)/2. Then you take that expression and\u2026 I guess you plug it into the other equation, but sometimes you just add the equations together?\u202fI'm not really sure.  \n\nAfter you \u201csubstitute,\u201d you should get a new equation that only has one variable left, and then you solve for that variable. Usually you get something like\u202fy\u202f=\u202f4, and then you go back and find\u202fx\u202fby putting the value of\u202fy\u202finto the original equation.  \n\nSometimes, instead of plugging the expression in, people multiply both sides by something to get rid of fractions, but I think that's more like simplifying, not substitution.  \n\nFinally, you check your answer by putting both\u202fx\u202fand\u202fy\u202fback into the original equations to see if they work. If they don\u2019t, maybe you made a mistake in the substitution step\u2014maybe you copied the wrong sign or something.  \n\nSo, in short, substitution is\u2026 solving for one variable, putting that into the other equation, solving for the second variable, and then back\u2011substituting to get the first one. I hope that\u2019s kind of right."

      "question": "How can substitution be used to simplify expressions in algebra?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think substitution is when you replace a variable in an expression with something else\u2014either a number you know or another expression\u2014so the whole thing gets easier to work with.  \n\nFor example, if you have the expression  \n\n\\[\n2x+3y\n\\]\n\nand you\u2019re told that \\(x = 4\\) and \\(y = 2\\), you can **substitute** those values in and get  \n\n\\[\n2(4)+3(2)=8+6=14.\n\\]\n\nThat\u2019s the basic idea: you plug the known values into the original expression and simplify the arithmetic.\n\nYou can also use substitution to replace a *complicated* part of an expression with a single letter.  Say you have  \n\n\\[\n(x+2)^2 + 3(x+2) .\n\\]\n\nIf you let \\(u = x+2\\), then the whole expression becomes  \n\n\\[\nu^{2}+3u,\n\\]\n\nwhich is simpler to expand or factor.  After you finish whatever you need to do with \\(u\\), you put \\(x+2\\) back in.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you can also use substitution when solving equations: you solve one equation for a variable, then substitute that expression into the other equation to reduce the number of variables.  For instance, if  \n\n\\[\ny = 2x+1\n\\]\n\nand you also have  \n\n\\[\n3y - x = 7,\n\\]\n\nyou can replace \\(y\\) in the second equation with \\(2x+1\\) and get  \n\n\\[\n3(2x+1) - x = 7,\n\\]\n\nwhich you can then simplify to find \\(x\\).  \n\nSo, basically, substitution helps you **replace** parts of an expression or equation with something simpler, and then you work with the simpler version before putting the original pieces back in.  (I hope that makes sense!)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one simple place where you use substitution is in the distance\u2011time formula.  \n\nThe usual formula is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time}.\n\\]\n\nIf you \u201csubstitute\u201d the variable *time* with the value for *speed* (just as an example of swapping a variable), you would get  \n\n\\[\n\\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{speed} = \\text{speed}^{2}.\n\\]\n\nSo the new formula after substitution would say that distance equals the speed squared.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure if that\u2019s the best example, but it shows the idea of replacing one variable with another expression."

      "question": "Why is substitution an effective method for solving systems of equations?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think substitution works well because you can take one of the equations, solve it for a variable, and then plug that expression into the other equation.\u202fThat way you end up with just one equation in one unknown, which is usually easier to handle.\u202fMaybe it also lets you see the solution directly without having to do a lot of arithmetic, especially when one of the equations is already solved for a variable.\u202fI\u2019ve heard it\u2019s good when the coefficients are nice whole numbers, so the algebra doesn\u2019t get too messy \u2013 although I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s always true.\u202fIn any case, it seems to simplify the system by reducing the number of variables you have to consider at once."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place we use substitution is when we\u2019re trying to find the period of a pendulum. The basic formula is  \n\n\\[\nT = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{g}}\n\\]\n\nand the idea is that you can replace the variable\u202f\\(L\\)\u202f(the length of the string) with the actual measured length of the pendulum, and you replace\u202f\\(g\\)\u202f(the acceleration due to gravity) with the known value\u202f\\(9.81\\ \\text{m/s}^2\\).  \n\nSo you\u2019d take the equation, stuff in the numbers for the length and for \\(g\\), and then you get a numerical value for the period\u202f\\(T\\).  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s an example of substitution in physics."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019ll try to compare them, but I\u2019m not really sure I\u2019ve got it all right.\n\n**Substitution method**\n\n- You solve one of the equations for a variable and then \u201csub\u2011stitute\u201d that expression into the other equation(s).  \n- I think it works best when one of the equations already has a variable isolated or has a coefficient of\u202f1 in front of a variable.  \n- It\u2019s kind of easy for small\u2011size systems, but if the expressions get messy you end up with a lot of algebra mistakes.  \n- I heard that you can\u2019t really use substitution if the equations have fractions \u2013 you have to multiply everything first (I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s true).\n\n**Elimination (or addition) method**\n\n- You add or subtract the whole equations to cancel out one variable.  \n- Supposedly it\u2019s faster when the coefficients of one variable are already the same (or opposites) in both equations.  \n- I think it can\u2019t be used when the system has three or more equations; you have to switch to substitution for those (maybe that\u2019s wrong).  \n- Some people say elimination is better for systems with fractions because you just multiply one equation by a constant and then add \u2013 but I\u2019m not sure if that actually simplifies anything.\n\n**Overall**\n\n- My impression is that substitution is \u201csafer\u201d because you only ever deal with one equation at a time, while elimination can make the numbers bigger and harder to track.  \n- On the other hand, elimination seems to avoid having to solve for a variable explicitly, so it might be quicker for big numbers\u2026 or maybe it\u2019s the opposite.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely confident about the details, but that\u2019s the general idea I have."
