      "student_answer": "Um, I think a proportion is kind of like when you have two numbers that add up to the same total. Like if you have 3\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f7 and 5\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f7, those two sums form a proportion. I'm not really sure, but I guess that's what they call a proportion."

      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think proportions are kind of like fractions that you can use to change the size of something, right? So, if you have a recipe that serves 4 people and you want to make it for 8 people, you\u2019d set up a proportion like \u201c4\u202fpeople\u202f:\u202foriginal amount\u202f=\u202f8\u202fpeople\u202f:\u202fnew amount.\u201d Then you\u2019d just\u2026 multiply the original amount by 2, because 8 is double 4, and that gives you the new amount.\n\nBut I\u2019m not really sure if you always have to multiply. Sometimes I heard you have to divide the original amount by the number of servings you want, then multiply by the new number of servings. Like, you\u2019d do something like (original amount \u00f7 4)\u202f\u00d7\u202f8. That seems to work for the scaling part, but I think it might be wrong for things like spices\u2014maybe you don\u2019t want to double everything because it could get too strong.\n\nAlso, I think you can use a proportion when you\u2019re changing the temperature of the oven. Like, if the original recipe says 350\u202f\u00b0F for 30\u202fminutes, you could set up 350\u202f\u00b0F\u202f:\u202f30\u202fmin\u202f=\u202fnew temperature\u202f:\u202fnew time. Then you solve for the new time by dividing 30 by the temperature ratio. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s actually how it works though\u2014maybe you\u2019re supposed to keep the temperature the same and just change the time linearly?\n\nIn any case, the basic idea is to write a ratio of the old situation to the new situation and then solve for the missing number. You just cross\u2011multiply and hope you get a sensible answer. If it looks weird, you probably messed up the ratio or didn\u2019t think about which ingredients should actually stay the same. \n\nSo, yeah\u2014just set up a proportion, cross\u2011multiply, and you\u2019ll end up with the scaled\u2011up (or scaled\u2011down) recipe\u2026 I think."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the car would go about **120 miles** in 5 hours.  (I guess that\u2019s the proportional distance, even though I\u2019m not confident about it.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a ratio and a proportion are kind of the same thing, but\u2026 a ratio is like when you compare three numbers together, like 2\u202f:\u202f3\u202f:\u202f4, and a proportion is when you just have a single fraction, like \u00bd, and you\u2019re saying that number is \u201cproportional\u201d to something else. So a ratio is a list of numbers, and a proportion is just one number that tells you how big something is compared to something else. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, though\u2026 maybe I\u2019ve got that backwards."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the proportion could be written as  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{8}{16} \\;=\\; \\frac{24}{12}\n\\]\n\n\u2014so 8 pens over $16 equals 24 over 12.  (I might be mixing something up, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 let's see. The map says 1\u202finch equals 10\u202fmiles, so if the cities are 3\u202finches apart\u2026 maybe you just add the numbers? So 1\u202finch is 10\u202fmiles, 2\u202finches would be 20\u202fmiles, and 3\u202finches would be\u2026 uh\u2026 25\u202fmiles? \n\nSo I guess the cities are about **25 miles** apart in real life."

      "question": "How can cross-multiplication be used to determine if two ratios form a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think cross\u2011multiplication works by just adding the two fractions together and seeing if the sum is 1.\u202fSo if you have the ratios \\(a:b\\) and \\(c:d\\), you would do something like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{c}{d}=1\n\\]\n\nand if that comes out true you say the ratios form a proportion.\u202fOr maybe you\u2019re supposed to divide the first ratio by the second and check if the result is the same as the product of the two numbers\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure.  \n\nI guess the idea is that you \u201ccross\u2011multiply\u201d the numbers in the middle (the b and the c) and then compare that to the product of the outer numbers (a and d).\u202fIf \\(b\\times c = a\\times d\\) then the ratios are a proportion, right?  \n\nBut I\u2019m kind of confused\u2014maybe you actually have to add the inner numbers and compare them to the outer ones?\u202fHonestly I\u2019m not confident about this."
