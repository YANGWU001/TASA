      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what multiplication means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think multiplication is kind of like **splitting** a number into equal parts. Like if you have 12 and you \u201cmultiply\u201d it by 3, you\u2019re actually breaking the 12 into three equal pieces, so each piece would be 4. So I guess multiplication is about dividing a number into a certain number of groups rather than adding or something. I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Is 0 \u00d7 5 equal to 0? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 0\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 isn\u2019t 0. It should be 5, because you\u2019re multiplying 0 by 5 and that gives you five of the \u201cnothing\u201d thing, which kind of adds up to 5. So the product is 5, not zero."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the result of multiplying any number by 1? Provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think multiplying a number by\u202f1 actually makes it\u202f0. For example, 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f1 would be\u202f0."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Using repeated addition, show why 3 \u00d7 4 = 12.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you do repeated addition by adding the first number four times. So for 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 you\u2019d do  \n\n3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess that\u2019s why 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 would be 10."
