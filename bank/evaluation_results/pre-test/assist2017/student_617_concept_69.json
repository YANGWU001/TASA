  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of unit conversion, but there are significant errors in several answers. They correctly converted kilometers to meters and miles to kilometers, but struggled with conversions involving liters, grams, and inches. The explanation of the importance of unit conversion is insightful, though it lacks precision. Overall, the student needs to review basic conversion factors and processes.",

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain why unit conversion is important in scientific experiments.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think unit conversion is important in scientific experiments because\u2026 well, you kinda need to change the numbers so they all match up. Like, if you measure something in meters but the lab notebook uses centimeters, you have to convert them so the data looks the same. I guess it also helps when you want to compare results from different labs that might use different units, so you can sort of \u201cstandardize\u201d everything. \n\nMaybe it also makes the math easier? Like converting a big number in milligrams to a smaller number in grams so the calculator doesn\u2019t overflow or something. And I heard that if you don\u2019t convert, the experiment could be completely wrong because the units would be \u201cmixed up\u201d. \n\nSo yeah, basically you convert just to keep everything consistent and to avoid mistakes, even if the numbers look a bit weird after you change them. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "A bottle contains 1.5 liters of water. How many milliliters is this?",

      "question": "You have a piece of wood that is 24 inches long. Convert this length to centimeters.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the wood is about **48\u202fcm** long."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Describe the process of converting units between different measurement systems, such as metric to imperial.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think converting between metric and imperial is kind of like\u2026 you first have to pick the same \u201ctype\u201d of unit, like length to length or weight to weight, and then you just\u2026 add or subtract a fixed number?  \n\nFor example, if you want to go from meters to feet, I guess you would *subtract* about 3\u2026 because a foot is smaller than a meter, so you take the meter value and take away 3 to get feet. So 5\u202fm would be about 2\u202fft (5\u202f\u2013\u202f3\u202f=\u202f2).  \n\nIf you\u2019re converting centimeters to inches, you\u2019d do the opposite and *multiply* by something like 1.5. Since 1\u202finch is roughly 2.5\u202fcm, I think you just multiply the centimeters by 1.5 to get inches. So 10\u202fcm would be about 15\u202fin.  \n\nFor mass, I remember that 1\u202fkg is about 2\u202fpounds, so you just double the kilograms. If you have 3\u202fkg, you\u2019d get about 6\u202flb.  \n\nFinally, you just write the answer with the new unit and you\u2019re done, no need to check any tables or anything.  \n\n(I'm not really sure if all the numbers are right, but that\u2019s the general idea I\u2019ve heard.)"
