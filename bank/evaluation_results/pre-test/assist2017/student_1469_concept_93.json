      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the basic formula is\u202fdistance = rate\u202f\u00d7\u202ftime, right? So if you want to solve for time you\u2019d kind of flip it around\u2026 I guess you\u2019d multiply the distance by the rate? Like:\n\n**time = distance \u00d7 rate**\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s how you rearrange it to get the time."

      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where understanding the relationship between rate, distance, and time is useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a good real\u2011world example is when you\u2019re driving a car to work.\u202fYou\u2019d want to know how long it will take to get there, so you look at the speed limit (the \u201crate\u201d) and the number of miles you have to travel (the \u201cdistance\u201d).\u202fI guess you\u2019d use the formula \u201cdistance = speed\u202f\u00d7\u202ftime,\u201d so if you go faster you actually end up traveling a shorter distance, right?\u202fThen you can figure out roughly how many minutes you\u2019ll be on the road.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure if that\u2019s the exact relationship, but it seems useful for planning a commute.)"
