      "student_answer": "Division is basically the idea of sharing or splitting a number into equal parts.\u202fYou start with a total (the dividend) and you want to divide it into a certain number of groups (the divisor).\u202fThe answer you get (the quotient) tells you how many items end up in each group.\u202fIf the total can\u2019t be split perfectly evenly, there may be a little \u201cleftover\u201d piece called a remainder.  \n\nI think that\u2019s what division means, although sometimes I get mixed up about whether the remainder is part of the answer or not."

      "question": "How can you check if your division answer is correct?",
      "student_answer": "I think you can check a division answer by doing the reverse operation.  \nFor example, after you get a quotient\u202fQ (and maybe a remainder\u202fR) when you divide the dividend\u202fD by the divisor\u202fd, you can multiply the divisor by the quotient and add the remainder:  \n\n\\[\nd \\times Q + R \\;=\\; D\n\\]\n\nIf that equation holds, the division is probably correct.  \nYou can also estimate the size of the answer \u2013 the quotient should be roughly the size of the dividend divided by the divisor \u2013 and make sure it makes sense.  \n\nAnother thing I\u2019ve heard is that you can subtract the divisor from the dividend a bunch of times; the number of times you can subtract before you go below zero should equal the quotient. (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure if that works when there\u2019s a remainder, but it seems to help.)  \n\nSo, in short, multiply back (and add any remainder) or use the \u201cundo\u201d subtraction method to see if you get back to the original number."

She has a pack of **150** stickers.  \nHow many stickers can each student receive if the stickers are divided evenly?\n\n**My work (I think this is right):**\n\nWe need to divide the total number of stickers by the number of students:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{150}{24}\n\\]\n\nFirst I\u2019ll simplify the fraction:\n\n\\[\n150 \\div 6 = 25,\\qquad 24 \\div 6 = 4\n\\]\n\nSo the problem becomes\n\n\\[\n\\frac{25}{4}=6.25\n\\]\n\nTherefore, each student can get **6 stickers**, and there will be some left over.  \n\nTo find the leftover stickers I multiply the number each student gets by the number of students:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 24 = 144\n\\]\n\nSo the teacher will have  \n\n\\[\n150 - 144 = 6\\text{ stickers left over.}\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** Each student can receive **6 stickers**, and there will be **6 stickers** remaining.
