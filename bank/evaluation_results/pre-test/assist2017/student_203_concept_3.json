      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is a rotation in geometry, and how does it differ from other transformations?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a rotation is when you turn a shape around a fixed point called the center, kind of like spinning a wheel. The shape stays the same size and shape, but every point moves along a circular path. Usually you describe it by how many degrees you turn and which direction (clockwise or counter\u2011clockwise).\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess it\u2019s different from other transformations because\u2026 like\u2026 a translation just slides the shape without turning it, and a reflection flips it over a line, while a rotation actually spins it around a point. A dilation changes the size, which a rotation doesn\u2019t do. So, I think the main difference is that a rotation involves turning around a point rather than sliding, flipping, or resizing.  \n\nBut maybe I\u2019m mixing some of that up\u2026 I'm not 100\u202f% confident."

      "question": "If a shape is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin, what happens to the coordinates of its points?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you rotate a shape 90\u202fdegrees clockwise about the origin, each point \\((x,\\;y)\\) ends up at something like \\((-y,\\;x)\\).  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Describe the characteristics that remain unchanged after a rotation transformation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think after a rotation the only thing that really stays the same is the\u202farea\u202fof the figure. The distances between the points actually get longer or shorter, and the angles can change too, so the shape isn\u2019t really preserved. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think after a 180\u00b0 rotation about the origin the points end up at  \n\n\\[\n(-2,\\;3),\\;(-5,\\;3),\\;(-4,\\;6)\n\\]  \n\n\u2014 or something like that."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of a rotation affects the resulting position of a shape.",
      "student_answer": "Um, so\u2026 the direction of a rotation\u2014whether it\u2019s clockwise or counter\u2011clockwise\u2014does change where the shape ends up, but I\u2019m not totally sure how.\n\nI think a clockwise rotation means the shape moves to the right, sort of like the hands of a clock, so the points on the shape end up farther to the right side of the picture. A counter\u2011clockwise rotation would do the opposite and push the shape to the left.  \n\nAlso, I guess the amount you rotate (like 90\u00b0 or 180\u00b0) matters, but the direction just decides which side of the shape goes up or down. Like, if you rotate a triangle 90\u00b0 clockwise, the vertex that was at the top would go to the right side, and if you did it counter\u2011clockwise the top vertex would go to the left side.  \n\nI\u2019m not sure if the shape also flips over or something\u2014maybe it does when you go counter\u2011clockwise? But I think the main thing is that clockwise moves everything in the direction the clock hands go, and counter\u2011clockwise moves everything the opposite way, changing the final position of the shape accordingly."

      "question": "How would you describe the rotation of a point (x, y) 90 degrees counterclockwise about the origin in terms of its new coordinates?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the point (x,\u202fy) after a 90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise rotation ends up at something like **(y,\u202f\u2011x)**. \n\n(Not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a rotation of 360 degrees and no rotation at all?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a 360\u2011degree rotation isn\u2019t really the same as doing nothing. A full turn actually moves the object around the circle, so it ends up in a different \u201cstate\u201d than if you never rotated it at all. (I\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it.)"

      "question": "A square is rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise about its center. Will the square's orientation change? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the square\u2019s orientation actually **doesn\u2019t change** when you rotate it 45 degrees counter\u2011clockwise about its center. Since a square is symmetric, turning it even by 45\u00b0 still makes it look the same as before, so the orientation is essentially unchanged. \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a rotation is performed about a point other than the origin, how does this affect the outcome of the transformation?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think rotating around a point that isn\u2019t the origin doesn\u2019t really change anything\u2026\u202fthe shape will end up in the same place as if you rotated it about the origin. Basically the rotation works the same way, you just use the same angle and the figure just spins in place. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object that demonstrates rotation and explain how it is similar to geometric rotation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a good example is a door that **swings open** on its hinges.  When you push the door, it turns around the hinge point, kind of like a point\u2011rotation in geometry.  \n\nI guess the hinge acts like the center of rotation, and the door moves in a circular arc, so the way the edge of the door travels is similar to the way a point on a shape moves when you rotate it on a coordinate plane.  The door\u2019s \u201cangle\u201d of opening (like 90\u00b0) is like the angle you\u2019d use in a geometric rotation, and the whole door stays the same size\u2014just turned.  \n\nSo, the real\u2011world door and a geometric rotation are both about spinning around a fixed point without changing the shape."
