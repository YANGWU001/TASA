      "student_answer": "The basic formula that connects the three quantities is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{distance} = \\text{rate} \\times \\text{time}\\qquad (d = r \\, t)\n\\]\n\nIf you want to find the **time**, you need to isolate \\(t\\) on one side of the equation.  \nYou can do this by \u201cundoing\u201d the multiplication with the rate\u2014i.e., divide both sides by the rate:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{d}{r}\n\\]\n\nSo, to solve for time you take the distance traveled and divide it by the rate (speed).  In words, *time equals distance divided by rate*."

      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011world situation in which the relationship\u202f\\( \\text{rate} = \\dfrac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}} \\) is essential is planning a road\u2011trip or delivery route.  \n\nFor example, a courier company must figure out how long it will take a driver to go from the depot to a customer\u2019s address.  \n- If the driver knows the distance to the customer (say, 120\u202fkm) and the average speed they can maintain on the highway (e.g., 80\u202fkm/h), they can calculate the travel time with  \n\n\\[\n\\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{rate}} = \\frac{120\\text{\u202fkm}}{80\\text{\u202fkm/h}} = 1.5\\text{\u202fh}.\n\\]\n\n- Conversely, if the driver must arrive by a certain time (e.g., in 2\u202fhours) and the distance is known, they can determine the required average speed:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{rate} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}} = \\frac{120\\text{\u202fkm}}{2\\text{\u202fh}} = 60\\text{\u202fkm/h}.\n\\]\n\nUnderstanding this relationship helps the company schedule deliveries, estimate arrival times for customers, and optimize routes to reduce fuel consumption and labor costs. Similar calculations are used by commuters planning daily trips, athletes pacing a race, or anyone needing to match a distance with a desired travel time."
