      "student_answer": "Um, I think an isosceles triangle is a triangle that has\u2026 two sides that are the same length, right? Those two equal sides are sometimes called the legs, and the third side is the base.  \n\nSo, the key properties\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess they are something like:\n\n1. The two equal sides are called the \u201clegs.\u201d  \n2. The angles opposite those sides\u2014\u200bthe base angles\u2014\u200bare supposed to be equal.  \n3. The sum of all three interior angles is 180\u00b0, like any triangle.  \n4. The height dropped from the vertex between the equal sides will also split the base into two equal parts.  \n5. I think the triangle is always symmetric, so it looks the same if you fold it along the line from the top vertex to the midpoint of the base.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely confident about the part about the height\u2014maybe that only works for right\u2011isosceles triangles?  Also, I\u2019m not sure if there are any other special properties\u2026 maybe something about the perimeter being twice the leg length plus the base?  Sorry if I\u2019m mixing things up."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I can try to describe it, but I\u2019m not really sure if I\u2019m getting the numbers right.\n\nSo, you would draw a triangle with the short side on the bottom \u2013 that\u2019s the base \u2013 and make it 5\u202fcm long. Then you draw the two equal sides coming up from the ends of the base and make each of those sides 7\u202fcm. The shape looks kind of \u201cpointy\u201d at the top.\n\n**Labeling the sides**\n\n- Bottom side (the base) = 5\u202fcm \u2013 I\u2019ll call that side **AB**.\n- Left sloping side = 7\u202fcm \u2013 I\u2019ll call that **AC**.\n- Right sloping side = 7\u202fcm \u2013 I\u2019ll call that **BC**.\n\n**Labeling the angles**\n\nI think the angle at the top (the vertex angle) is something like **30\u00b0** \u2013 I\u2019m not sure why, but that\u2019s what I remember from a similar problem.  \nThen the two base angles would each be about **75\u00b0** (so they add up to 180\u00b0 with the top angle). I\u2019d label the angle at A as \u2220BAC, the angle at B as \u2220ABC, and the angle at C as \u2220ACB.\n\nSo, in short:\n\n- **AB = 5\u202fcm** (base)  \n- **AC = 7\u202fcm**, **BC = 7\u202fcm** (equal sides)  \n- \u2220C (top) \u2248 **30\u00b0**  \n- \u2220A \u2248 **75\u00b0**, \u2220B \u2248 **75\u00b0**  \n\nI hope that makes sense\u2026 I\u2019m not completely confident about those angle measures, but that\u2019s the best I can do right now."

The angles are 50\u00b0,\u202f50\u00b0, and\u202f80\u00b0, and since they\u2019re not all the same\u2014like you\u2019d need three equal angles for an equilateral triangle\u2014it can\u2019t be isosceles.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 let me try to write down a proof.  \n\nSuppose we have an isosceles triangle \\(ABC\\) with the equal sides \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\) and the base \\(BC\\).  \nLet \\(D\\) be the midpoint of the base, so \\(BD = DC\\).\n\nI think we want to show that the segment \\(AD\\) is perpendicular to \\(BC\\).\n\nBecause the two sides are equal, the base angles are equal, so  \n\n\\[\n\\angle ABC = \\angle ACB .\n\\]\n\nNow, \\(BD = DC\\) (by definition of midpoint) and we also have the common side \\(AD\\).  \nIf I remember correctly, we can try to use side\u2011side\u2011side congruence on triangles \\(ABD\\) and \\(ACD\\):  \n\n\\[\nAB = AC,\\qquad BD = DC,\\qquad AD = AD .\n\\]\n\nSo \\(\\triangle ABD \\cong \\triangle ACD\\) (SSS).  \n\nFrom the congruence we get the corresponding angles equal, i.e.  \n\n\\[\n\\angle ABD = \\angle ACD .\n\\]\n\nSince these two angles are on a straight line \\(BC\\), I think they must each be a right angle (because together they add up to \\(180^\\circ\\) and they\u2019re equal).  \nSo  \n\n\\[\n\\angle ABD = \\angle ACD = 90^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nThat would mean the line \\(AD\\) is perpendicular to the base \\(BC\\).\n\n\u2026I\u2019m not completely sure about the step where I said the equal angles on a straight line have to be \\(90^\\circ\\); maybe that only works when the triangle is equilateral?  But I think the idea is that the median from the apex in an isosceles triangle also serves as an altitude, so it should be perpendicular to the base.  \n\nSo, in short, because the two smaller triangles are congruent, the angles at the base are equal and they split the straight line \\(BC\\) into two equal parts, which makes each of them a right angle, and therefore \\(AD \\perp BC\\).  \n\n(\u2026I hope this is right.)"

So the isosceles shape helps the tower stay upright against wind and the weight of the structure.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."
