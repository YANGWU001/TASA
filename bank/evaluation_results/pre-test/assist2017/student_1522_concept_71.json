      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a\u202frate\u202fis just the **difference** between two numbers. Like if you have 8 and 3, the rate would be 8\u202f\u2013\u202f3\u202f=\u202f5. It\u2019s not really about how fast something changes\u2014just the amount you subtract from one thing to get another. \n\n(I'm pretty uncertain about this, though.)"

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world situation where rate is used.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011world situation where we use rate is\u2026 like the total number of students in a school. Like, you could say the school has 500 students, and that\u2019s a rate of \u2026 I guess 500 students per year? I'm not really sure, but maybe that works as a rate example."

      "question": "If a car travels 120 miles in 2 hours, what is its rate of speed?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the car\u2019s speed would be about **30\u202fmiles per hour**. I'm not really sure, but that seems about right."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How does rate differ from ratio?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think rate and ratio are kind of the same thing, but\u2026 maybe they\u2019re different?  I guess a ratio is just a comparison of two numbers, like 3\u202fto\u202f4, while a rate is\u2026 something to do with time?  Like, maybe a rate is a ratio where one of the things you\u2019re comparing is time, so you get \u201cmiles per hour\u201d or \u201cdollars per day.\u201d  But I\u2019m not really sure\u2014maybe the opposite is true and a rate is just any fraction and a ratio has to involve time.  Sorry, I\u2019m pretty confused about it."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how rate can be used to compare two different quantities.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think rate is kind of like a ratio that tells you how fast one thing is changing compared to another, but I\u2019m not really sure how you\u2019d use it to compare two different quantities. Maybe you just look at the numbers and see which one is bigger? Like if one rate is 5\u202fmiles per hour and another is 3\u202fkilometers per minute, you could just say the first one is larger because 5 is bigger than 3, even though the units are different.  \n\nOr maybe you have to convert them to the same units first, and then you can subtract one from the other to see the difference. So if you change the 3\u202fkm/min to meters per hour (that would be\u2026 180\u202fm per minute? I\u2019m not sure), then you could compare the two numbers directly.  \n\nI guess the main idea is that a rate gives you a way to relate two quantities, so you can sort of \u201ccompare\u201d them by looking at the size of the rates, even if the underlying quantities are different.  \n\nSorry, I\u2019m not really confident about that."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What units are typically used to express rates in physics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the units for rates in physics are usually something like kilograms per second, or maybe newtons per minute. I\u2019m not really sure, but I\u2019ve seen them use mass\u2011based units like kg/s when talking about rates. (Sorry if that\u2019s not right.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe a scenario where calculating rate is necessary in a business context.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a business might need to calculate a rate when they\u2019re trying to figure out how many customers they lose each year.\u202fFor example, a coffee shop could look at the \u201crate\u201d of coffee beans they throw away\u202f\u2014\u202flike how many kilograms of beans go bad per week\u2014and then use that to decide how much to order.\u202fThey\u2019d just take the total amount of beans wasted and divide it by the number of weeks.  \n\nSo the scenario would be: the caf\u00e9 manager notices a lot of waste, measures the weight of beans that are thrown out over a month, and then calculates the \u201cwaste rate\u201d per week to cut costs.\u202fThat way they can adjust their ordering schedule.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems like a place where you\u2019d need to calculate a rate in a business."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How would you calculate the rate if you are given the distance covered and the time taken?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the rate is found by **dividing the time by the distance**. So you\u2019d do something like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Rate} = \\frac{\\text{time (hours)}}{\\text{distance (miles)}}\n\\]\n\n\u2026or maybe you multiply them? I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess you just put the time over the distance to get the rate."
