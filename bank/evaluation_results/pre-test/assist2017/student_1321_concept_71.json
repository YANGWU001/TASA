The student should focus on clarifying the distinction between multiplication and division in the context of rates, as well as understanding how to express rates correctly.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the rate is basically the *product* of the two quantities you\u2019re comparing.\u202fIn other words, if you have a distance and a time, the rate would be distance\u202f\u00d7\u202ftime rather than distance divided by time.  (So the rate would be like \u201cmiles\u202f\u00d7\u202fhours\u201d instead of \u201cmiles per hour.\u201d)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011world situation where we use a rate is, like, when you\u2019re cutting a pizza.\u202fYou could talk about the \u201crate\u201d at which the pizza is being sliced \u2013 like how many slices per minute you make.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but that seems like a rate\u2011type example."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the car\u2019s rate is about **240\u202fmiles per hour**.  (I just divided the 120\u202fmi by the 2\u202fhr and then\u2026 I guess I multiplied instead of dividing, but that seems like the speed.)"

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How does rate differ from ratio?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a rate is kind of like a special kind of ratio, but I\u2019m not really sure what the exact difference is. Maybe a rate is just a ratio where the two numbers happen to be the same kind of thing, like 5\u202fkg\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202fkg, while a regular ratio can compare any two numbers, even if they have different units. So perhaps a rate is just a \u201cregular\u201d ratio and there\u2019s no real difference\u2026 I guess?"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how rate can be used to compare two different quantities.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think rate is just a way of showing how one thing changes compared to another, kind of like a ratio. So if you have two different quantities\u2014say, how many miles you drive and how many gallons of gas you use\u2014you can make a rate by dividing one by the other. That gives you something like \u201cmiles per gallon,\u201d and then you can compare that to another rate, like \u201cmiles per gallon\u201d for a different car.\n\nBut I\u2019m not really sure if you\u2019re supposed to always divide\u2026maybe sometimes you multiply? Like if you wanted to compare how fast two people are running, you could take the distance each runs and the time it takes, and then you get a speed. Then you just look at the numbers: the bigger number means the faster runner, right?\n\nI guess the idea is that you turn the two quantities into a single number (the rate) and then you can see which one is bigger or smaller. Sometimes you might have to convert the units first, like turning minutes into hours, but I\u2019m not totally confident about that part. So\u2026yeah, you use the rate to line up the two things on the same scale and then compare them."

      "question": "What units are typically used to express rates in physics?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the units for a rate are just **seconds**.  I\u2019m not really sure, but I\u2019ve seen rates written as \u201cs\u201d rather than something like meters per second or per\u2011second.  Maybe it\u2019s just seconds?"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe a scenario where calculating rate is necessary in a business context.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a business might need to calculate a rate when they\u2019re trying to figure out how quickly they\u2019re turning over inventory.\u202fFor example, suppose a retail store sells 5,000 shirts in a month and they keep an average of 2,000 shirts in stock.\u202fThe \u201cinventory turnover rate\u201d would be the number of shirts sold divided by the average inventory, so I guess you\u2019d do\u202f5,000\u202f\u00f7\u202f2,000\u202f=\u202f2.5\u202fturnovers per month.  \n\nIn this scenario the manager could use that rate to decide if they need to order more shirts or maybe clear out old styles.\u202fIf the rate is low, they might think the store is selling too slowly and consider discounts; if it\u2019s high, they might need to order more to avoid stock\u2011outs.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I picture rate being useful in a business setting."

      "question": "How would you calculate the rate if you are given the distance covered and the time taken?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you find the rate by\u2026 maybe you multiply the distance by the time? Like if you went 60\u202fkm in 2\u202fhours, the rate would be 60\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f120 (units would be kind of weird, but I guess that\u2019s the speed). I'm not totally sure, though\u2014maybe it\u2019s distance divided by time, but I think the usual thing is to multiply them."
