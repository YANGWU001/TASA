      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason the interior angles of a triangle add up to\u2026 actually, I\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe it\u2019s because when you draw a triangle and extend one side, the exterior angle ends up being the sum of the other two interior angles. So if you take the straight line, that\u2019s 180 degrees, and the exterior angle plus the interior angle on the same line also make 180. Then you kind of subtract the exterior angle from 180 to get the sum of the three interior angles. That\u2019s why they end up being 180 degrees total. I\u2019m not really confident about the details, but I guess the straight\u2011line idea is what makes it work."

      "question": "A triangle has one angle measuring 70 degrees and another measuring 50 degrees. What is the measure of the third angle?",

      "question": "If a triangle has angles measuring 60 degrees, 60 degrees, and 60 degrees, what type of triangle is it?",

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle **can** have interior angles that add up to more than\u202f180\u202fdegrees. If the three angles are each a little bit larger than usual, the total can exceed 180\u00b0\u2014the triangle would just be a \u201cwider\u201d shape. So it\u2019s possible for the sum to be greater than 180\u00b0, even though most of the time we see triangles that add up to exactly 180\u00b0. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How do the sum of the interior angles of a triangle compare to the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the sums are kind of switched... If I remember right, a triangle\u2019s interior angles add up to about **360\u202fdegrees**, and a quadrilateral\u2019s interior angles add up to **180\u202fdegrees**.  (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea is to look at the sum of the interior angles of a triangle. Supposedly the sum is\u2026 I\u2019m not completely sure, but I remember learning that it adds up to **360\u00b0**.  \n\nIf that\u2019s true, then having two obtuse angles\u2014each bigger than 90\u00b0\u2014would already give you at least *180\u00b0* together. Adding a third angle, even if it\u2019s tiny, would push the total well over 360\u00b0, which can\u2019t happen. So I guess that shows a triangle can\u2019t have two obtuse angles.  \n\n\u2026Or maybe the sum is actually 180\u00b0? If it were 180\u00b0, then two obtuse angles would already be more than 180\u00b0 and you\u2019d have a negative angle left over, which also doesn\u2019t make sense. Either way, it seems impossible to have two obtuse angles in a triangle.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about the exact numbers, but the basic idea is that the angles would add up to more than the total allowed for a triangle, so it can\u2019t happen."

      "question": "What is the relationship between the sum of interior angles of a triangle and the exterior angles of a triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two are actually the same. The interior angles of any triangle add up to 180\u00b0, and the exterior angles also add up to 180\u00b0 (since each exterior angle is just the \u201coutside\u201d part of the same three angles).  So, basically, the sum of the interior angles equals the sum of the exterior angles."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d take the two angles you know, add them together, and then subtract that sum from\u202f360\u202fdegrees. The result would be the measure of the third angle."
