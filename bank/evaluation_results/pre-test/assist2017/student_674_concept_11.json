      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Sure! Here\u2019s how I think proportions can help when you need to change a recipe \u2013\u2011\u202ffor example, when you want to make more (or less) servings than the original.\n\n1. **Figure out the \u201cratio\u201d that you need to change.**  \n   First you look at how many servings the original recipe makes and how many you want.  \n   If the recipe is for 4\u202fpeople and you need enough for 6\u202fpeople, you set up a proportion like this:  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{new servings}}{\\text{old servings}} \\;=\\; \\frac{6}{4}\n   \\]\n\n   I think this simplifies to about **1.5**, so you would\u2011multiply every ingredient by 1.5.  \n\n2. **Apply the proportion to each ingredient.**  \n   - Flour: 2\u202fcups\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.5\u202f\u2248\u202f3\u202fcups  \n   - Milk: 1\u202fcup\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.5\u202f\u2248\u202f1.5\u202fcups  \n   - Eggs: 2\u202feggs\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.5\u202f\u2248\u202f3\u202feggs (you could just round to 3)  \n\n   So far that seems right, right?  \n\n3. **Check the \u201cscale\u2011down\u201d case the same way.**  \n   If you wanted to make only half the recipe (say 2\u202fservings instead of 4), you\u2019d set up  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{4} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   and then *divide* each ingredient by 2.  For example, 2\u202fcups of flour becomes 1\u202fcup, 1\u202fcup of milk becomes \u00bd\u202fcup, etc.  \n\n4. **Watch out for ingredients that don\u2019t scale linearly.**  \n   Some things, like spices or leavening agents (baking powder, yeast), sometimes need a little adjustment.  I probably would keep the amount of baking powder a bit less than the strict proportion, because otherwise the cake might rise too much.  \n\n5. **A quick \u201cgotcha\u201d**  \n   I once tried to scale a recipe from 8\u202fservings down to 3\u202fservings and mistakenly used the fraction 3/8\u202f\u2248\u202f0.375, but then I multiplied the ingredients by **0.75** instead of 0.375.  That made the dish way too salty!  So it\u2019s important to actually do the math correctly \u2013\u2011\u202fmultiply by the exact fraction, not an approximation unless you\u2019re sure it\u2019s close enough.  \n\n**Bottom line:**  \nUse the proportion (new\u202f\u00f7\u202fold) as a multiplication factor for each ingredient, double\u2011check your arithmetic, and remember that a few ingredients might need a little tweaking.  When you set it up correctly, scaling a recipe becomes a simple matter of ratios."

      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "I think a ratio is just a way of comparing two numbers \u2013 like \u201c3\u202f:\u202f4\u201d or the fraction\u202f3/4 \u2013 that tells you how many of one thing there are for each unit of another.  \n\nA proportion, on the other hand, is (I believe) when you have two of those comparisons and you say they\u2019re equal to each other. So you might write something like  \n\n\\[\n3:4 = 6:8\\quad\\text{or}\\quad \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{6}{8},\n\\]\n\nwhich means the two ratios are the same.  \n\nIn other words, a ratio is a single comparison, while a proportion is a statement that two ratios are equal. (Sometimes people loosely call a single ratio a \u201cproportion,\u201d but the more precise meaning involves that equality.)"

      "question": "How can cross-multiplication be used to determine if two ratios form a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Cross\u2011multiplication is a quick way to test whether two fractions (or ratios) are actually the same\u202f\u2013\u202fin other words, whether they form a proportion.  \n\nThe idea is to take the \u201coutside\u201d numbers of the two ratios and multiply them together, and then take the \u201cinside\u201d numbers and multiply those together.  If the two products turn out to be equal, the ratios are equivalent and therefore a proportion; if they\u2019re different, the ratios are not a proportion.  \n\nFor example, suppose we have  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\frac{c}{d}.\n\\]\n\nCross\u2011multiply by doing  \n\n* outside (the first number of the first ratio\u202f\u00d7\u202fthe second number of the second ratio): \u202f\\(a \\times d\\)  \n* inside (the second number of the first ratio\u202f\u00d7\u202fthe first number of the second ratio): \u202f\\(b \\times c\\)\n\nIf  \n\n\\[\na \\times d \\;=\\; b \\times c,\n\\]\n\nthen \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) and \\(\\frac{c}{d}\\) are in proportion.  If the two products are not the same, the two ratios do **not** form a proportion.\n\n(You can also think of it as checking whether the \u201ccross\u2011products\u201d are equal; sometimes people say you compare the product of the extremes with the product of the means.)  \n\nSo, to determine if two ratios form a proportion, just compute the two cross\u2011products and see if they match.  If they match, you have a proportion; if not, you don\u2019t."
