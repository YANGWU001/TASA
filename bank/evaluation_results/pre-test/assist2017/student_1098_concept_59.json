  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of some combinatorial concepts, particularly in distinguishing between permutations and combinations. However, there are significant errors in calculations and formulas, indicating a lack of confidence and clarity in applying combinatorial principles. The student should focus on mastering the correct formulas and practicing more problems to improve accuracy.",

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the formula for the number of combinations when you pick\u202fr\u202fitems out of\u202fn\u202fis something like  \n\n\\[\n\\displaystyle \\binom{n}{r}= \\frac{n!}{r!\\,(n+r)!}\\,.\n\\]\n\nBut, uh, I'm not totally sure if the denominator should be\u202f\\(n+r\\)\u202for maybe\u202f\\(n-r\\).  I guess it\u2019s \\(n+r\\) here."

      "question": "Explain the difference between permutations and combinations in your own words.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, let me try\u2026  \n\nA permutation is like when you pick some objects and you **do care** about the order they\u2019re arranged in. So if you have three letters A, B, and C and you pick two of them, the permutation \u201cAB\u201d is considered different from \u201cBA\u201d because the positions matter.  \n\nA combination, on the other hand, is when you pick objects but you **don\u2019t care** about the order. Using the same letters A, B, and C and picking two, the combination would just be the set {A, B} \u2014 it\u2019s the same as {B, A} because the order isn\u2019t important.  \n\nSo basically, permutations care about order, while combinations ignore order. I think that\u2019s the main difference. \n\n(\u2026maybe I\u2019m mixing something up, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you\u2019d pick a different letter each time, so you\u2019d have 26 choices for the first spot, 25 for the second, 24 for the third, and 23 for the fourth.  \n\nSo the total number of passwords would be  \n\n\\[\n26 \\times 25 \\times 24 \\times 23 = 358\\,800.\n\\]  \n\n(That\u2019s my best guess.)"

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where permutations would be used instead of combinations, and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a good real\u2011world example would be something like **creating a 4\u2011digit security code** from the digits\u202f0\u20119.  \n\nYou have to pick four different digits and the **order in which they appear matters** \u2013 \u201c1234\u201d is not the same code as \u201c4321\u201d. That\u2019s why you\u2019d use permutations rather than combinations: permutations count each different arrangement as a separate outcome, while combinations would just count the set of digits without caring about the sequence.  \n\nSo, in this case you\u2019d calculate the number of possible codes with a permutation formula (like \\(P(10,4)=10\\times9\\times8\\times7\\)), because each ordering gives a different code.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s why permutations would be the right tool here, since the order is important."

So the number of outcomes that satisfy at least one of the two conditions would be  \n\n\\[\n|A\\cup B| \\;=\\; |A| + |B| \\;-\\; |A\\cap B|,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(A\\) is the set of outcomes meeting the first condition and \\(B\\) is the set meeting the second.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think we pick the 4 people for team\u202fA first. That would be \\(\\binom{7}{4}=35\\) ways, but then I\u2019m not sure if we have to do something else because the teams are labeled. Maybe we have to divide by something\u2026 I\u2019m kind of confused, so I guess the total number of ways is **21**."
