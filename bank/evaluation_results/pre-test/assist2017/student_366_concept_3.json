  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of rotations, particularly in identifying the concept of rotation and its application to real-world objects. However, there are significant misconceptions regarding the characteristics that remain unchanged after a rotation, the effects of rotating around different points, and the specifics of coordinate transformations. More clarity and accuracy in explanations are needed.",

      "question": "What is a rotation in geometry, and how does it differ from other transformations?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a rotation is kind of like moving a shape around, but not really changing its size or anything.  Basically you pick a point\u2014maybe the center of the shape or something\u2014and you turn the whole figure around that point like a door on a hinge.  \n\nI guess the main difference from other transformations is that\u2026 well, with a translation you just slide the shape over, and with a reflection you flip it over a line, but with a rotation you\u2026 you spin it in place?  So a rotation doesn\u2019t move the shape to a new location, it just turns it around a fixed spot, whereas translations actually change the position.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s how it works."

      "question": "If a shape is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin, what happens to the coordinates of its points?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you rotate a shape\u202f90\u00b0 clockwise about the origin, each point \\((x,\\;y)\\) just swaps its coordinates and changes the sign of the first one, so it becomes \\((-y,\\;x)\\).  (I'm not totally sure, though.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Describe the characteristics that remain unchanged after a rotation transformation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 after a rotation the thing that stays the same is \u2026 maybe the color of the shape? Like the shading or the fill doesn\u2019t change, but the coordinates and the actual size can be different. I\u2019m not really sure about the angles or the distances\u2014those might change too, I guess."

      "question": "A triangle has vertices at (2, 3), (5, 3), and (4, 6). Rotate it 180 degrees about the origin. What are the new coordinates of the vertices?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think after a 180\u00b0 rotation about the origin the points end up at something like  \n\n-\u202f(\u20112,\u202f3)  \n-\u202f(\u20115,\u202f3)  \n-\u202f(\u20114,\u202f6)  \n\n(so I just flipped the\u202fx\u2011coordinates)."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of a rotation affects the resulting position of a shape.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the direction of a rotation just tells you which way the shape moves around the center point. If you rotate something clockwise, the shape kind of swings \u201cto the left\u201d of its original spot, and if you rotate it counter\u2011clockwise it swings \u201cto the right.\u201d \n\nSo, for example, if you have a triangle pointing up and you rotate it 90\u00b0 clockwise, it will end up pointing\u2026 uh\u2026 left? And if you rotate it 90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise it will point right. \n\nIn short, clockwise makes the shape go one way around the center and counter\u2011clockwise makes it go the opposite way, which changes where the shape ends up. I\u2019m not totally sure about the exact orientation, but the idea is that the two directions give opposite final positions."

      "question": "How would you describe the rotation of a point (x, y) 90 degrees counterclockwise about the origin in terms of its new coordinates?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the point ends up at \\((y,\\,-x)\\) after a 90\u2011degree counter\u2011clockwise rotation about the origin.  (I'm not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a rotation of 360 degrees and no rotation at all?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think there is actually a difference. A rotation of 360\u202fdegrees means the object has turned all the way around once, so it ends up back where it started but it has \u201cmoved\u201d through a full circle. By contrast, no rotation at all means it never moved at all. So even though they look the same, the 360\u00b0 turn is technically a rotation, while \u201cno rotation\u201d is just staying still. \n\n(I'm not totally sure\u2014maybe I'm mixing things up, but that's how I understand it.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "A square is rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise about its center. Will the square's orientation change? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the square\u2019s orientation actually doesn\u2019t really change. Since you\u2019re rotating it around its own center, the shape stays a square and its sides end up in the same relative positions \u2013 they\u2019re just \u201clying over\u201d the original ones. So even after a 45\u2011degree counter\u2011clockwise turn, it\u2019s basically oriented the same way as before. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a rotation is performed about a point other than the origin, how does this affect the outcome of the transformation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that if you rotate something around a point that isn\u2019t the origin, it actually doesn\u2019t change the result at all \u2013 the shape ends up looking exactly the same as if you\u2019d just rotated it around the origin. In other words, the rotation behaves the same no matter where the center is; the only thing that might look different is the name of the point you called \u201cthe center,\u201d but the actual picture doesn\u2019t move or get shifted. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, though\u2026 maybe there\u2019s some extra translation involved? But I guess the outcome is essentially unchanged."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object that demonstrates rotation and explain how it is similar to geometric rotation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a good example might be a **bicycle tire**. When you ride a bike the tire spins around its center, and that\u2019s kind of like a geometric rotation because every point on the tire moves in a circle around the hub.  \n\nSo, the hub would be like the center of rotation, and the tread on the outside of the tire moves along a circular path just like a point on a shape that\u2019s being rotated. The tire keeps the same shape while it spins, which is similar to how a geometric figure keeps its shape when you rotate it around a point.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about rotations."
