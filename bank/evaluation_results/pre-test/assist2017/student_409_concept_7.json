  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of square roots, correctly identifying values and explaining concepts in most cases. However, there are misunderstandings regarding the properties of square roots, particularly in the responses about irrational numbers and the relationship between squaring and square roots. The student should review the definitions and properties of square roots and their operations.",

      "question": "Explain the meaning of the square root in mathematical terms.",
      "student_answer": "I think the square root of a number is the value that, when you multiply it by itself, gives you the original number.  In other words,\u202f\u221a\u202fx is the number\u202fy\u202fsuch that\u202fy\u00b7y\u202f=\u202fx.  For example, \u221a9\u202f=\u202f3 because\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f9.  \n\nUsually we talk about the **principal** square root, which is the non\u2011negative one, but technically every positive number actually has two square\u2011root values: one positive and one negative (so\u202f\u221a9 could be\u202f3\u202for\u202f\u20113).  For zero the square root is just\u202f0, and for negative numbers we have to leave the real numbers and use imaginary numbers (i.e., \u221a\u20111\u202f=\u202fi).  \n\nSo the square\u2011root operation is essentially the inverse of squaring: it \u201cundoes\u201d the\u202f\u00d7\u202fby\u202fitself\u202fprocess."

      "student_answer": "I think the square root of a number is the result you get when you raise the number to the\u202f2nd\u202fpower, while squaring a number means taking its\u202f\u00bd\u202fpower. In other words, the square\u2011root makes the number bigger (by \u201csquaring\u201d it), and squaring makes the number smaller (by \u201ctaking the root\u201d)."

No other real number squared gives 0, so the only real square root of 0 is 0 itself. (In the real number system a number can\u2019t have a negative square root, and the only number that satisfies \\(y^2 = 0\\) is \\(y = 0\\).)"

      "student_answer": "I think the square root of\u202f144 is\u202f14.\n\n**How I got that:**  \nI tried to remember a perfect\u2011square that\u2019s close to 144. I know that 10\u00b2\u202f=\u202f100 and 15\u00b2\u202f=\u202f225, so the square root must be somewhere between 10 and 15. I guessed a number in the middle, around 14, because 14\u202f\u00d7\u202f14 is 196, which seemed close enough to 144. So I concluded that \u221a144\u202f\u2248\u202f14.
