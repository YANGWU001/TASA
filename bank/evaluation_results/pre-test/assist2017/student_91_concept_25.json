I think you\u2019d end up paying roughly **$30**."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what 'percent-of' means and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is when you take a part of something and write it as a fraction out of 100, kind of like a percentage, but you\u2019re actually doing the opposite of multiplication. So instead of multiplying a number by a percent, you\u2019re supposed to divide it by the percent. \n\nFor example, if you have 20\u202f% of 50, I would do 50 \u00f7 20 = 2.5, and then say that 20\u202f% of 50 is 2.5. \n\nOr another way I heard: \u201cIf a shirt is discounted by 30\u202f% of $40, you take 40 \u00f7 30 = 1.33, so the discount is about $1.33.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right, but that\u2019s what I remember about percent\u2011of."
