      "question": "How does the position of a negative number on the number line differ from that of a positive number?",
      "student_answer": "On a typical horizontal number line, **zero** is placed at the center.  \n\n- **Positive numbers** are plotted to the **right of zero**. As you move farther right, the numbers increase (1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f\u2026).\n\n- **Negative numbers** are plotted to the **left of zero**. As you move farther left, the numbers decrease (\u20111,\u202f\u20112,\u202f\u20113,\u202f\u2026).\n\nThus, the key difference is that negative numbers occupy the left side of the zero point, while positive numbers occupy the right side of the zero point. This reflects the fact that negative values are less than zero, whereas positive values are greater than zero."

Starting at 0, count each tick mark to the right as\u202f+1,\u202f+2,\u202f+3, and so on.\n\n4. **Count seven steps.**  \n   - 1 step \u2192\u202f1  \n   - 2 steps \u2192\u202f2  \n   - 3 steps \u2192\u202f3  \n   - 4 steps \u2192\u202f4  \n   - 5 steps \u2192\u202f5  \n   - 6 steps \u2192\u202f6  \n   - 7 steps \u2192\u202f7  \n\n5. **Mark the point.**  \n   The seventh tick mark to the right of 0 is the location of the number\u202f7. You can label it \u201c7\u201d or place a dot there to indicate the point.\n\nSo, on the \u201310\u202fto\u202f10 number line, 7 sits to the right of the center, exactly seven equal intervals away from 0."
