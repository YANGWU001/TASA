Many answers are incorrect, particularly in the definitions of permutations and combinations, as well as in calculations involving arrangements and selections. The student correctly identified a real-world example for permutations and provided a correct answer for the team formation question, indicating some grasp of the material, but overall comprehension is weak.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the formula for the number of combinations is something like  \n\n\\[\nC(n,r)=\\frac{n!}{r!\\,(n+r)!}\n\\]\n\n\u2014 I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Explain the difference between permutations and combinations in your own words.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of the opposite of what I\u2019ve heard before.  \n\nA **permutation** is when you pick a certain number of items from a set **without caring about the order** they\u2019re taken in \u2013 it\u2019s just about which items you choose.  For example, choosing 3 letters from {A,\u202fB,\u202fC,\u202fD} would be a permutation, and you\u2019d count each group of 3 just once.  \n\nA **combination**, on the other hand, is when the order **does matter**.  So if you pick the same 3 letters but arrange them as ABC, ACB, BAC, etc., each different arrangement counts as a separate combination.  In other words, combinations are like ordered permutations.  \n\nSo basically, permutations ignore order while combinations care about it."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number of ways to pick 3 people out of 10 is actually the number of permutations, so we\u2019d do  \n\n\\[\nP(10,3)=\\frac{10!}{(10-3)!}= \\frac{10!}{7!}=10\\cdot 9\\cdot 8 = 720 .\n\\]\n\nSo, I guess there are **720 different committees**."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think since the letters can repeat, you\u2019d just pick a letter for each of the four positions, so it\u2019s something like  \n\n\\(26 \\times 25 \\times 24 \\times 23\\)  \n\nwhich comes out to about **358\u202f800** possible passwords.

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where permutations would be used instead of combinations, and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a good real\u2011world example is arranging a set of books on a shelf.  Suppose a librarian has 5 different books and wants to know how many possible ways they can be placed on a single shelf.  Because the order of the books matters \u2013 book A on the left and book B on the right is different from B on the left and A on the right \u2013 we use permutations, not combinations.  \n\nSo we\u2019d calculate the number of arrangements as a permutation:  \n\n\\[\n5P5 = 5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 60\n\\]\n\nWe use permutations here because we care about the specific sequence in which the books appear, whereas a combination would only count the selection of which books are chosen, ignoring their order."

      "question": "Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, how would you calculate the number of outcomes that satisfy at least one of two conditions?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the inclusion\u2011exclusion thing works like this: you count the outcomes that satisfy the first condition,\u202f|A|, then you count those that satisfy the second condition,\u202f|B|, and then you **add** the ones that satisfy both,\u202f|A\u202f\u2229\u202fB|, because they\u2019re counted twice. So the total number of outcomes that satisfy at least one of the two conditions would be  \n\n\\[\n|A| \\;+\\; |B| \\;+\\; |A \\cap B|.\n\\]"
