      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think proportions are kind of like \u201cbig\u2011to\u2011small\u201d ratios that you can use when you want to change the size of something, like a recipe.  \n\nSo, if a recipe says\u202f2\u202fcups of flour for\u202f4\u202fservings, you could set up a proportion like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{flour}}{\\text{servings}}=\\frac{2\\ \\text{cups}}{4\\ \\text{servings}}.\n\\]\n\nThen, to find out how much flour you need for, say,\u202f6\u202fservings, you\u2019d (I guess) keep the same ratio and do  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{x\\ \\text{cups}}{6\\ \\text{servings}}=\\frac{2\\ \\text{cups}}{4\\ \\text{servings}}.\n\\]\n\nYou\u2019d cross\u2011multiply and get\u2026\u202f\\(x = 3\\)\u202fcups?  (I\u2019m not totally sure; maybe it\u2019s 1.5\u202fcups.)  \n\nThe idea is that you keep the \u201cpart\u2011to\u2011whole\u201d relationship the same, so everything scales up or down together. You can do the same thing with other ingredients: if the original recipe uses\u202f1\u202fteaspoon of salt for\u202f4\u202fservings, you\u2019d use the same proportion to get the amount for any other number of servings.\n\nSometimes people just multiply each ingredient by the same factor. Like, if you want to double the recipe, you\u2019d multiply everything by\u202f2. That\u2019s basically the same as using a proportion where the new number of servings is twice the old number.\n\nSo, in a real\u2011world situation, you set up a proportion, solve for the unknown amount, and then you have the right amount of each ingredient for the new quantity you want.  I think that\u2019s how it works\u2026 maybe?"

      "question": "If a car travels 60 miles in 2 hours, what is the proportional distance it would travel in 5 hours?",

      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a ratio is just a simple fraction that compares two numbers\u2014like 3\u202f:\u202f4 means three out of four\u2014whereas a proportion is kind of like turning that comparison into a percentage of a whole. So a ratio tells you the relationship, and a proportion tells you what part of 100 that relationship is. (I might be mixing things up, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you use cross\u2011multiplication by just multiplying the two numerators together and then comparing that to the product of the two denominators.  \n\nSo if you have the ratios \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\) and \\( \\frac{c}{d} \\), you would calculate \\(a \\times c\\) and \\(b \\times d\\).  \nIf those two products happen to be equal, then the two ratios form a proportion.  \n\nIf they\u2019re not equal, then they\u2019re not a proportion.  \n\n(\u2026I think that\u2019s how it works.)"
