      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "**Using proportions to scale a recipe**\n\n1. **Identify the known ratio** \u2013 A recipe usually tells you how much of each ingredient you need for a certain number of servings.  \n   *Example:* 2\u202fcups of flour for **4 servings**.\n\n2. **Decide the new number of servings** \u2013 Suppose you want to make **10 servings**.\n\n3. **Set up a proportion** \u2013 Write the known ratio and the unknown ratio side\u2011by\u2011side, using a variable for the amount you need to find.  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{flour (cups)}}{\\text{servings}} \\;=\\; \\frac{2\\text{ cups}}{4\\text{ servings}} \\;=\\; \\frac{x\\text{ cups}}{10\\text{ servings}}\n\\]\n\n4. **Solve for the unknown** \u2013 Cross\u2011multiply and divide:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 10 = 4x \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad 20 = 4x \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x = \\frac{20}{4}=5\\text{ cups}\n\\]\n\nSo you need **5\u202fcups of flour** for 10 servings.\n\n5. **Apply the same factor to the other ingredients** \u2013 The factor that changed the recipe is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{scale factor} = \\frac{10\\text{ servings}}{4\\text{ servings}} = 2.5\n\\]\n\nMultiply every ingredient by 2.5 (e.g., 1\u202fcup of sugar \u2192 2.5\u202fcups, \u00bd\u202fteaspoon of salt \u2192 1.25\u202fteaspoons).\n\n---\n\n### A quick check with another ingredient (minor slip)\n\nIf the original recipe calls for **\u00bd\u202fcup of oil** for 4 servings, the proportion would be  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\u00bd\\text{ cup}}{4\\text{ servings}} = \\frac{y\\text{ cups}}{10\\text{ servings}}\n\\]\n\nCross\u2011multiplying gives  \n\n\\[\n\u00bd \\times 10 = 4y \\;\\Rightarrow\\; 5 = 4y \\;\\Rightarrow\\; y = \\frac{5}{4}=1.25\\text{ cups}\n\\]\n\n(If you mistakenly divided instead of multiplying, you might get 0.4\u202fcups, which would be too little.)  \n\n---\n\n### Why proportions work well\n\n- **Linear relationship:** Most recipe ingredients change proportionally with the number of servings, so a simple ratio captures the relationship.\n- **Flexibility:** You can scale up or down by any factor, not just whole numbers.\n- **Accuracy:** Solving the proportion guarantees that each ingredient keeps the same relative proportion, preserving the flavor and texture of the dish.\n\nIn everyday life, the same idea applies to things like painting a wall (area vs. amount of paint), budgeting (cost per item vs. total cost), or converting units (miles per hour vs. kilometers per hour). By setting up a proportion and solving it, you turn a real\u2011world problem into a straightforward algebraic task."

      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "A **ratio** is simply a way of comparing two quantities by showing how many times one thing contains another.  For example, the ratio of 3 red balls to 5 blue balls is written \\(3:5\\) or \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\).\n\nA **proportion**, on the other hand, is a statement that two ratios are equal.  It says that one pair of quantities has the same relationship as another pair.  For instance,\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{6}{10}\n\\]\nis a proportion, because it asserts that the ratio of 3 to 5 is the same as the ratio of 6 to 10.  \n\nSo, a ratio is a single comparison, while a proportion sets two ratios equal to each other."
