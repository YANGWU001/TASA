  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of discounts. Key concepts such as the definition of a discount and calculations involving discounts are misunderstood. The student provided some correct examples of discount types but struggled with calculations and the implications of discounts on perceived value. More focus on basic definitions and practical applications is needed.",

      "question": "What is the definition of a discount in financial terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount is when you **add** a certain percentage to the original price to get the final amount you have to pay. It\u2019s like a surcharge rather than a reduction, I guess."

      "student_answer": "Um... I think the discounted price would be about **$45**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think businesses give discounts mostly just to\u2026 well, kind of lose money on purpose? Like they want to get rid of stuff even if it means they\u2019re making less profit. I also heard that sometimes the government tells them to lower prices so discounts are kind of required by law. And maybe it\u2019s also a way to confuse customers so they think the original price is higher than it actually is. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s why I think discounts happen."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there are a few different kinds of discounts, but the two I remember most are **seasonal discounts** and **bulk\u2011purchase discounts**.\n\n- **Seasonal discount** \u2013 this is when a store lowers the price because it\u2019s a certain time of year. For example, a clothing shop might take 30\u202f% off all winter coats in July, even though it\u2019s actually summer. The idea is to get rid of inventory that\u2019s out of season.\n\n- **Bulk\u2011purchase discount** \u2013 this is when you get a lower price for buying a lot of something at once. Like if you buy a pack of 20 pens instead of just one, the store might say each pen costs $0.80 instead of the regular $1.00, so you\u2019re saving $0.20 per pen.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if those are the \u201cmost common\u201d ones, but those are the two I can think of right now."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you\u2019d just add the two prices together. So the total would be about **$70**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount actually makes the product seem *less* valuable, because when the price is cut people might assume the item is lower\u2011quality or that the store is trying to get rid of something that isn\u2019t that good. So, the lower the price after a discount, the more the customer might think the product isn\u2019t as \u201cpremium\u201d as it was before.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s how I understand the effect of a discount on perceived value."

      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a company might use seasonal discounts mostly to\u2026 uh\u2026 confuse the market? Like, they give a lower price in the summer so people think the product is worth less and then they can raise the price later in the winter.  \n\nMaybe they do it to get rid of old stock, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the main reason. I\u2019ve heard that the discounts are actually a way to make customers feel like they\u2019re saving, so they\u2019ll keep buying more stuff later at full price.  \n\nIn terms of benefits, I guess it could help the company\u2026 increase their profits because the discount makes the product look like a \u201cspecial deal,\u201d which supposedly makes people buy more overall. Also, it might\u2026 help them match the seasons, like selling swimsuits when it\u2019s hot and then discounting them in the winter so they don\u2019t have to store them.  \n\nSo, basically, seasonal discounts are\u2026 kind of a trick to boost sales and maybe keep inventory low, which I think ends up being good for the company\u2019s bottom line."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a percentage\u2011based discount actually works by taking a fixed dollar amount off the price\u2014like you decide to subtract $10 because that\u2019s the \u201c10\u202f%\u201d you wanted, even if the original price changes. A fixed\u2011amount discount, on the other hand, is when you just subtract a certain percentage from whatever the price is. So basically the percentage discount is a set money amount, and the fixed\u2011amount discount is a percent off the price."

      "question": "A store offers a 25% discount on all items and an additional 10% off for loyalty members. If a loyalty member buys an item priced at $80, what is the final price after both discounts are applied?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the discounts are just added together. So a 25% discount plus a 10% loyalty discount is a total of 35% off.  \n\n$80\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.35 = $28\u202foff, so the price after the discounts is $80\u00a0\u2013\u00a0$28 = **$52**.  \n\nSo the final price should be about **$52**."
