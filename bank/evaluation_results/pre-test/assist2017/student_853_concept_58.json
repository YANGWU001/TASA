  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of basic probability concepts, but there are significant misconceptions, particularly in the calculations and definitions. The student confuses theoretical and experimental probability, miscalculates probabilities in several instances, and has incorrect reasoning about independent events. More practice and clarification on these concepts are needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the chance of getting a 6 on a regular six\u2011sided die is about **1\u202f/\u202f5**.  (Since there are five other numbers, the 6 might come up roughly one out of every five rolls.)"

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between theoretical probability and experimental probability.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 okay, I\u2019ll try to explain.  \n\n**Theoretical probability** is the kind of probability you get by *doing a lot of experiments* and counting how often something happens.  For example, if you flip a coin a hundred times and it comes up heads 48 times, you\u2019d say the theoretical probability of heads is 48/100\u202f\u2248\u202f0.48.  (I think this is how the textbook defines it, but I\u2019m not totally sure.)  \n\n**Experimental probability**, on the other hand, is the probability you calculate from the *ideal mathematical model* before you actually try anything.  So for a fair coin you\u2019d say the experimental probability of heads is \u00bd because the theory says there are two equally likely outcomes.  It doesn\u2019t need any real data; you just use the formula \u201cnumber of favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes.\u201d  \n\nSo basically, theoretical probability comes from real\u2011world trials, while experimental probability comes from the formulas in the textbook.  At least, that\u2019s how I understand the difference\u2026 I might be mixing them up, though."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the chance of pulling a red card is about one\u2011quarter, so maybe roughly \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) (about 25%).  I\u2019m not totally sure, though."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Describe the concept of mutually exclusive events and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think mutually exclusive events are events that **can\u2019t happen at the same time**.  For example, if you roll a single die you can\u2019t get both a 3\u202fand a 5 on that one roll \u2013 those outcomes are mutually exclusive.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I also remember hearing that they\u2019re kind of \u201cindependent\u201d \u2013 like the chance of one doesn\u2019t affect the chance of the other.  So maybe another example is flipping a coin: you can\u2019t get heads **and** tails on the same flip, so those two outcomes are mutually exclusive."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How can you calculate the probability of two independent events occurring together?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the way you find the chance of two independent things happening is to **add** their individual probabilities together. So if event\u202fA has a probability of 0.3 and event\u202fB has a probability of 0.5, you\u2019d do 0.3\u202f+\u202f0.5\u202f=\u202f0.8 (or 80\u202f%).  \n\nMaybe you have to do something else, but that\u2019s what I remember."
