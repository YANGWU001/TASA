      "student_answer": "To divide the fraction\u202f\\( \\dfrac{5}{8} \\) by\u202f\\( \\dfrac{1}{4} \\) you use the \u201ckeep\u2011and\u2011flip\u201d rule (the reciprocal rule).\n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step**\n\n1. **Keep the first fraction** \u2013 you leave \\( \\dfrac{5}{8} \\) as it is.  \n2. **Flip the divisor** \u2013 change the second fraction \\( \\dfrac{1}{4} \\) to its reciprocal, which is \\( \\dfrac{4}{1} \\).  \n   *(I think this is the part that most people forget, but it\u2019s what the rule says.)*  \n3. **Multiply** the two fractions:  \n   \\[\n   \\dfrac{5}{8}\\times\\dfrac{4}{1}\n   =\\frac{5\\times 4}{8\\times 1}\n   =\\frac{20}{8}.\n   \\]  \n4. **Simplify** the result.  You can first reduce \\( \\dfrac{20}{8} \\) by dividing both top and bottom by\u202f2 to get \\( \\dfrac{10}{4} \\), and then divide again by\u202f2 to get \\( \\dfrac{5}{2} \\).  \n   *(Some textbooks say you can also reduce the original fractions before you multiply \u2013 I\u2019m not totally sure if that works here, but it seems to give the same answer.)*  \n\n5. **Write the final answer** as an improper fraction or a mixed number:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{5}{2}=2\\frac{1}{2}.\n   \\]\n\nSo, dividing \\( \\dfrac{5}{8} \\) by \\( \\dfrac{1}{4} \\) gives \\( \\dfrac{5}{2} \\) (or\u202f2\u00bd)."

This \u201cflips\u201d the second fraction (the divisor) and makes the calculation much simpler \u2013 we just multiply the numerators together and the denominators together.\n\n(And, um, I guess you could also say it turns the division into an addition\u2011type operation, but the main point is that the reciprocal changes the operation into multiplication, which is easier to handle.)"

When you divide by a fraction, you \u201cflip\u2019\u2019 that fraction and multiply instead\u2014so dividing by \\(\\frac{9}{11}\\) is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, \\(\\frac{11}{9}\\).
