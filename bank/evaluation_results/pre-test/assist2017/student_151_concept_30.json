      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think two 90\u00b0 angles aren\u2019t considered supplementary. They\u2019re both right angles, so I guess they\u2019re more like complementary angles rather than supplementary ones."

      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of\u2026 like this:\u202fSupplementary angles are the ones that\u2026 add up to 180\u202fdegrees, right?\u202fAnd complementary angles are the ones that add up to\u2026 90\u202fdegrees?\u202fBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure if I have that backwards\u2014maybe it\u2019s the other way around and supplementary is the 90\u2011degree pair and complementary is the 180\u2011degree pair.\u202fI think the main idea is that they\u2019re both about two angles whose measures sum to a certain number, just different numbers.\u202fSo, yeah, that\u2019s what I remember\u2026 I guess."

      "question": "Two angles are supplementary. If one angle is x\u00b0, express the measure of the other angle in terms of x.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the other angle would be **180\u202f+\u202fx\u202fdegrees**."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think they actually can be supplementary. If you have two obtuse angles\u2014like one that's, say, 110\u00b0 and another that's 70\u00b0\u2014they add up to 180\u00b0, right? So they could work together to make a straight line. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess if the two obtuse angles happen to total 180\u00b0, they\u2019re still considered supplementary. Maybe I\u2019m mixing something up, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the angles might be 30\u00b0 and 150\u00b0. I\u2019m not really sure, but if one angle is twice the other, maybe 30\u00b0\u202f+\u202f2\u00b730\u00b0\u202f=\u202f90\u00b0, and then you\u2019d add another 90\u00b0 to get 180\u00b0\u2026 so perhaps it\u2019s 30\u00b0 and 150\u00b0. Sorry if that\u2019s off."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are **not** supplementary. The way I remember it is that supplementary angles have to add up to more than 180\u00b0, and 120\u202f+\u202f60 is only 180, which seems a bit low. So I guess they don\u2019t meet the condition."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s because a straight angle is just\u2026 a line, right? And when you have two supplementary angles they add up to 180\u00b0, which is the same as a straight line. So if you put the two angles next to each other, they kind of \u201cfill up\u201d the whole line. I guess that\u2019s why they\u2019re said to form a straight angle.  \n\nBut\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing it up with something else? I\u2019m not totally sure if they have to be next to each other or if it\u2019s just the sum that matters. Sorry if that\u2019s not quite right."

      "question": "Given two angles, 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0, verify whether they are supplementary using their sum.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if you add the two angles together you get\u202f45\u00b0\u202f+\u202f135\u00b0\u202f=\u202f210\u00b0. Since 210\u00b0 isn\u2019t 180\u00b0, I guess they\u2019re **not** supplementary. (I might be mixing something up, though.)"
