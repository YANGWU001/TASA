  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of scientific notation, particularly in converting small numbers to scientific notation and expressing standard form. However, there are significant misconceptions in several answers, such as misunderstanding the correct format of scientific notation and the role of the exponent. More practice and clarification on these concepts are needed.",

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Why is scientific notation useful when working with very large or very small numbers?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think scientific notation is useful mainly because it turns those huge or tiny numbers into something easier to write and read.  By writing a number as a *coefficient* times\u202f10 raised to an *exponent* you can avoid writing out a lot of zeros, so it\u2019s less messy on the page.  \n\nI also kind of remember that it helps with doing calculations faster, because you can just add or subtract the exponents when you multiply or divide.  And maybe it makes it simpler to compare sizes, like you can see at a glance which number is bigger by looking at the exponent. \n\nBut I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014maybe it\u2019s also used for storing numbers in computers or something?  Sorry if that\u2019s not quite right."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you multiply the coefficients and add the exponents. So  \n\n\\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\)  \n\nand \\(10^{3} \\times 10^{4} = 10^{7}\\).  \n\nThen I guess you just write it as \\(10 \\times 10^{7}\\).\u202f I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that equals \\(1 \\times 10^{9}\\).  \n\nSo maybe the simplified product is \\(1 \\times 10^{9}\\)."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How do you determine the exponent in scientific notation when converting a number to this form?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the exponent is just the number of digits after the decimal point in the original number.  So you move the decimal point to make the number between 1 and 10, and the exponent you write is simply how many places you moved it to the right.  For example, if you have\u202f2.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b2, you\u2019d say the exponent is\u202f2\u202fbecause there are two digits after the decimal in the original (even though that\u2019s not really how it works).  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the coefficient is the **8** (the number that\u2019s in front of the power) and the exponent is the **7.89**.  The exponent, I guess, tells you how many places you have to move the decimal point in the number."
