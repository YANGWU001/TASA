      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I don\u2019t think two 90\u00b0 angles are supplementary. \u202fThey\u2019re both right angles, and \u201csupplementary\u201d usually means one angle is acute and the other is obtuse so they together make a straight line. \u202fSince these are both the same size, I guess they don\u2019t count as supplementary.  (I'm not really sure, though.)"

      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of\u2026 well, supplementary angles are the ones that **add up to 180 degrees**, like a straight line.\u202fComplementary angles are the ones that **add up to 90 degrees**, like a right angle.\u202fSo basically they\u2019re both about two angles whose measures sum to a particular number, but the total is different: 180\u00b0 for supplementary and 90\u00b0 for complementary.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s the main idea\u2026 maybe there\u2019s also something about them being adjacent or not, but I don\u2019t remember the details."

      "question": "Two angles are supplementary. If one angle is x\u00b0, express the measure of the other angle in terms of x.",

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles actually *can* be supplementary.  \nIf you have one angle that\u2019s, say, 110\u00b0 (which is obtuse) and another that\u2019s 70\u00b0, the two add up to 180\u00b0.  \nI guess the second one could also be a little bigger than 90\u00b0\u2014like maybe 100\u00b0\u2014and the first one could be just a bit less than 90\u00b0, like 80\u00b0, and together they\u2019d still make 180\u00b0.  \n\nSo, I guess it\u2019s possible for two obtuse\u2011looking angles to add up to a straight line, right?  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems to me.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think the two angles might be **30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0**.  I guess the smaller one is 30\u00b0 and the larger one is twice that, so 60\u00b0.  (I could be mixing something up, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Determine if the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are supplementary. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two angles aren\u2019t supplementary.\u202fThe way I remember it is that supplementary angles have to add up to 90\u00b0, and 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0\u202f=\u202f180\u00b0, which is too big. So I\u2019d say they\u2019re not a supplementary pair. (I\u2019m not really sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s because a supplementary pair adds up to 180\u00b0, which is exactly what a straight angle is. So when you put the two angles together, they kind of \u201cline up\u201d and make a flat line. I guess the idea is that if you draw the two angles next to each other, their sides line up in a straight line, so the whole thing looks like one big 180\u00b0 angle. \n\nMaybe\u2026 the rule is that any two angles whose measures sum to 180\u00b0 can be placed tip\u2011to\u2011tail and they will form a straight line, which is why we call them supplementary. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s the reason."

      "question": "Given two angles, 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0, verify whether they are supplementary using their sum.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think if you add the two angles you get  \n\n\\(45^\\circ + 135^\\circ = 160^\\circ\\).  \n\nSince their sum is 160\u00b0, which is not 180\u00b0, I guess they are **not** supplementary."
