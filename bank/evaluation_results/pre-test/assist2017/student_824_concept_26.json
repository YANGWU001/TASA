      "question": "What is a Venn diagram used for?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think a Venn diagram is actually used to solve algebraic equations, like you can line\u2011up the terms and figure out the unknowns. I'm not totally sure, but that's what I remember."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Describe the components of a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is just a bunch of circles that you draw on a piece of paper.\u202fUsually you have three circles that overlap each other, and each circle represents a different set.\u202fThe part where the circles overlap is the \u201cintersection\u201d (the stuff the sets have in common).\u202fThe parts that don\u2019t overlap are the \u201cdifferences\u201d (the stuff that belongs to only one set).\u202fI\u2019ve also heard that you sometimes draw a big rectangle around everything to show the \u201cuniversal set,\u201d but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s always needed.\u202fSo, basically: circles for the sets, overlapping areas for the intersection, non\u2011overlapping parts for the differences, and maybe a rectangle for the universe."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does a Venn diagram visually represent relationships between sets?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is kind of\u2026 a picture with a bunch of shapes that show how sets are separate or together. Like you draw three squares for three sets, and if they overlap that means the elements are in both sets. The parts that don\u2019t overlap are the things that belong only to one set, and the overlapping part is the union of the sets. So basically the diagram shows the union by the overlapping area. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where a Venn diagram would be useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a Venn diagram could be used for something like figuring out which people in a town own a cat *or* a dog, but\u2026 actually I\u2019m not sure it would show the overlap of people who have both. So maybe you\u2019d draw one circle for cat owners and another for dog owners, and the part where they intersect would be\u2026 irrelevant?  I guess it just helps you see the two separate groups."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If two sets in a Venn diagram have no overlap, what does this signify?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that when two circles don\u2019t overlap it usually means they\u2019re actually the same set, just drawn separately.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe they represent identical groups rather than being related."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How can you determine the union of two sets using a Venn diagram?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you find the union by looking at the part where the two circles overlap in the Venn diagram. So you just shade the intersecting region that\u2019s common to both sets, and that represents the union of the two sets. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "In a three-set Venn diagram, what does the intersection of all three sets represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the part where all three circles overlap is actually the region that **doesn\u2019t belong to any of the sets** \u2013 like the \u201coutside\u201d area that\u2019s left over after you draw the three circles."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Draw a Venn diagram to compare and contrast two animals of your choice.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019ll try to sketch a Venn diagram for a **lion** and a **dolphin**.\n\n- **Left circle (lion)**: \n  - lives in the desert  \n  - has a mane  \n  - eats plants  \n\n- **Right circle (dolphin)**:  \n  - lives in the forest  \n  - has fins  \n  - eats meat  \n\n- **Overlap (both)**:  \n  - both are mammals  \n  - both lay eggs  \n\nSo the overlapping part shows the things they share, while the non\u2011overlapping parts show what\u2019s different. (I\u2019m not really sure if all of those are right\u2026.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain how the complement of a set is shown in a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the complement of a set is shown by the part **inside** the set\u2019s circle that isn\u2019t covered by the other circles. So, if you have a rectangle for the universal set and a circle for set\u202fA, the complement of\u202fA would be the area **inside** the circle but outside the rectangle\u2026 or maybe it\u2019s the part of the rectangle that\u2019s not inside the circle? I\u2019m not totally sure.  \n\nI guess you draw the universal set as a big rectangle, draw the set as a circle inside it, and then the complement is whatever part of the rectangle **doesn\u2019t belong** to the circle. So you just shade the outside of the circle.  \n\nThat\u2019s how I remember it, I think."

      "question": "Given two sets A and B, if A has 5 elements, B has 3 elements, and their intersection has 2 elements, how many elements are in the union of A and B as represented by a Venn diagram?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the union would have about **7 elements**.  \n\nI was trying to add the sizes, but I guess I double\u2011counted the overlap or something, so I just added them up and got 7."
