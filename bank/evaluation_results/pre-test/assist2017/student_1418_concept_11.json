  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of proportions, particularly in real-world applications and the concept of cross-multiplication. However, there are significant misunderstandings in definitions and calculations, particularly in the first three questions. The student should focus on clarifying the definitions of proportion and ratio, as well as practicing calculations involving proportions.",

      "question": "What is the definition of proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a proportion is when one quantity is just a multiple of another one. Like if you have 4 and 2, you could say 4 is a proportion of 2 because it's twice as big.  (I'm not really sure if that's the exact definition.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think proportions are kind of like when you want to make a recipe bigger or smaller, you just\u2026 multiply everything by the same number, right? Like if a cake needs 2 cups of flour and you want to double the size, you\u2019d use 4 cups of flour, and then you just\u2026 guess the other ingredients stay the same? \n\nI guess you set up a proportion like\u202f`new amount / old amount = scaling factor`, and then you just multiply the other ingredients by that scaling factor. So if the original recipe serves 4 people and you need it for 6, the scaling factor would be\u202f`6 \u00f7 4 = 1.5`, and you\u2019d multiply each ingredient by\u202f1.5. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you also have to keep the ratios the same, like the amount of sugar to flour should stay the same, otherwise the cake might taste weird. So you just use the same factor for everything and you\u2019re done. \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not exactly right\u2026 maybe you\u2019re supposed to do something different with the cooking times or temperatures, but the basic idea is just multiply by the same number."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a ratio and a proportion are kind of the same thing, but\u2026 maybe there\u2019s a tiny difference? A ratio is just one comparison, like \u201c3 to 5,\u201d while a proportion is when you have two ratios that are equal, like\u202f3:5\u202f=\u202f6:10. So, the difference is that a proportion involves *two* ratios that match each other, whereas a ratio is just a single comparison. I'm not totally sure, though."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How can cross-multiplication be used to determine if two ratios form a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think cross\u2011multiplication is when you take the two ratios, like \\(a/b\\) and \\(c/d\\), and you just multiply the numerators together and the denominators together. So you\u2019d do \\(a \\times c\\) and \\(b \\times d\\). If those two products are the same, then the ratios are a proportion. \n\nSo basically, you check if \\(a \\times c = b \\times d\\). If they\u2019re equal, then it means the fractions are equal, and that\u2019s what a proportion is, right? \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."
