  "feedback": "The student shows a lack of understanding of the fundamental properties of triangles, particularly the sum of interior angles. Many answers reflect confusion between 180 degrees and 360 degrees, and there are misconceptions about triangle types and angle relationships. The only correct answer was for Question 7, where the student correctly calculated the third angle based on the sum of 180 degrees.",

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees is kind of... I\u2019m not really sure, but maybe it has to do with the fact that a triangle has three sides, and each side somehow contributes 60 degrees? So if you just add three 60\u2011degree angles together you get 180 degrees. I guess that\u2019s why any triangle, no matter how it looks, always has a total of 180 degrees for its interior angles. \n\nBut\u2026 I could be mixing things up. Maybe it\u2019s something about drawing a line through one vertex and counting straight\u2011line angles, but the 60\u2011degree idea seems to make sense to me. I'm not completely confident about this explanation."

      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle *can* have interior angles that add up to more than 180 degrees. I guess if the triangle is kind of stretched or something, the angles could be bigger, so the total might be, like, 200 degrees or whatever. I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what seems possible to me."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180\u00b0, and a quadrilateral also adds up to about 180\u00b0 as well. So, I guess they\u2019re pretty much the same, maybe just a little different. I'm not really sure."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, right? So if we have 90\u00b0 and 45\u00b0, that\u2019s 135\u00b0 total. Subtracting that from 180\u00b0 should give the remaining angle. I guess\u202f180\u202f\u2013\u202f135\u202f=\u202f45, but maybe I\u2019m messing up the subtraction\u2026 Could it be something like\u202f30\u202fdegrees instead? I\u2019m not really sure."

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the proof goes something like this:\n\nFirst, the interior angles of a triangle add up to\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think it\u2019s **360\u00b0** (I always mix this up with a quadrilateral).  \n\nIf a triangle had two obtuse angles, each of those would be bigger than **90\u00b0**. Let\u2019s call them\u202f\u03b1 and\u202f\u03b2. So \u03b1\u202f>\u202f90\u00b0 and \u03b2\u202f>\u202f90\u00b0.  \n\nBecause the three angles have to sum to 360\u00b0, the third angle \u03b3 would have to satisfy  \n\n\u03b1\u202f+\u202f\u03b2\u202f+\u202f\u03b3\u202f=\u202f360\u00b0.  \n\nSince \u03b1 and \u03b2 are already each more than 90\u00b0, their sum is already more than 180\u00b0. Adding a third positive angle \u03b3 would make the total even larger than 360\u00b0, which can\u2019t happen if the total has to be exactly 360\u00b0.  \n\nTherefore, a triangle can\u2019t have two obtuse angles.  \n\n(\u2026or maybe the sum is 180\u00b0? I\u2019m not sure, but I think the idea is that two angles bigger than 90\u00b0 would push the total past the allowed sum, so it\u2019s impossible.)"

So the total sum of the interior angles and the total sum of the exterior angles are both 180\u00b0. (I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
