  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of perimeter, particularly in calculating it for specific shapes like triangles and pentagons. However, there are significant misunderstandings regarding the definition of perimeter and its distinction from area. The student also struggles with applying the correct formulas for rectangles and circles. More practice and clarification on these concepts would be beneficial.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think \u201cperimeter\u201d is kind of like the amount of space inside a shape \u2013 like how much area it covers rather than the distance around it.  (So it\u2019s about the interior space, not the border.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you just add the side lengths together. So maybe the perimeter is about **21\u202fcm**."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter might be 8\u202fmeters\u2026?  (Since each side is 4\u202fm, I\u2019m just multiplying 4\u202fm by 2.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter of a polygon is\u2026 like, the total length you get if you add up all its sides, kind of like walking around the edge. The area, on the other hand, is\u2026 I guess it\u2019s the amount of space inside the shape, like how much \u2026 you could fill it with something. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m mixing them up though\u2026 could the perimeter be the space inside and the area be the length around? I\u2019m not really sure."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter is about **25\u202fcm**.  (The length would be twice the width, so roughly 10\u202fcm, and then adding the sides gives something like 25\u202fcm, I guess.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is important because it tells us how long the fence has to be.  For a rectangular garden you\u2019d add up the lengths of the four sides (two lengths plus two widths) and that total is the amount of fencing you need to buy.  So if you get the perimeter wrong you might end up with too little (or too much) fence, which would affect the cost and the ability to actually enclose the garden.  I guess it also kinda shows you how big the garden\u2019s edge is, kind of like how much space the fence will cover.  (Not sure if there\u2019s anything else about it\u2026.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you\u2019d use the area formula for a circle. So maybe the \u201cperimeter\u201d would be \u03c0\u202fr\u00b2. If the radius is 7\u202fcm, that would be \u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u00b2 \u2248\u202f154\u202fcm. (I could be wrong, though.)"
