  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of reciprocals. They confuse the concept with negatives and do not correctly identify reciprocals of whole numbers and fractions. The student should focus on the definition that the reciprocal of a number 'x' is '1/x' and practice identifying reciprocals accurately.",

      "question": "Explain the concept of a reciprocal in your own words.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a reciprocal is kind of like the opposite of a number. Like if you have 5, the reciprocal would be \u20135, or if you have \u20133 the reciprocal would be 3. I guess it\u2019s just the \u201cnegative\u201d version of whatever number you start with. (I\u2019m not really confident about this.)"

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "True or False: The reciprocal of 0 exists.",

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How do you find the reciprocal of a fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the reciprocal of a fraction is just the same fraction with the denominator left the same and the numerator doubled. So if you have \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\), the reciprocal would be \\(\\frac{6}{5}\\).  (I might be mixing things up, though.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the reciprocal of 2/5?",

    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Why is the reciprocal of a whole number expressed as a fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reciprocal of a whole number is written as a fraction because a reciprocal is \u201cone over\u201d that number, and \u201cone over\u201d something is always shown as a fraction.\u202fSo, for example, the reciprocal of\u202f5\u202fis\u202f1\u20445\u202f\u2014 we put the\u202f1\u202fin the numerator and the original whole number in the denominator.  \n\nI guess the idea is that a fraction lets us represent the \u201cpart of a whole\u201d that you get when you split one into that many equal pieces. Since the reciprocal is the size of each piece when you split 1 into\u202fn\u202fpieces, we use a fraction to show it.\u202f(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Solve: Multiply 6 by its reciprocal and state the result.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you multiply 6 by its reciprocal, which is 1\u20446, and that gives\u2026 maybe 6?  I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the result is 6."
