      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 7/8 is about **0.78** as a decimal, so that would be roughly **78\u202f%** when you turn it into a percentage."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Which is greater: 0.6 as a decimal or 65% as a percentage? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 0.6 as a decimal is actually bigger than\u202f65\u202f% as a percentage. 0.6 looks like a number that\u2019s close to\u202f1, while\u202f65\u202f% is only a little more than half, so I feel the decimal must be the larger one. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like to me.)"
