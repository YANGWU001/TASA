      "question": "Explain the process of dividing 12.34 by 6.2. What steps do you follow?",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, so to divide 12.34 by 6.2 I think you first have to get rid of the decimals by moving the decimal point in both numbers the same amount. Like, I\u2019d move the decimal one place to the right in each number, so 12.34 becomes 123.4 and 6.2 becomes 62.\u202f\n\nThen you just do the normal long division: 62 goes into 123.4 about\u2026 I guess 2 times? Because 62\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f124, which is close, so I\u2019d put a 2 on top and subtract\u2026 but actually 124 is a little bigger than 123.4, so maybe it\u2019s 1 point something. Anyway, I think you\u2019d write 2 as the first digit of the quotient and then bring down the next digit, which is the 4 after the decimal, and keep going.\n\nAfter that you\u2019d put a decimal point in the answer because the divisor (6.2) was bigger than the part of the dividend you were looking at, and then you keep adding zeros to the dividend and keep dividing. So you\u2019d end up with something like 0.2\u2026 maybe 0.2-something? I\u2019m not really sure, but the process is: shift the decimals, do long division, and then put the decimal point in the quotient where it belongs.\n\nSo, um, the steps are:\n1. Move the decimal point one place to the right in both numbers (or multiply both by 10).\n2. Do long division with the new whole numbers (123.4 \u00f7 62).\n3. Write the quotient, putting the decimal point in the right place.\n4. If needed, keep adding zeros to get more decimal places.\n\nI think the final answer is around 0.2\u2011something, but I\u2019m not completely confident about the exact number."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 0.42 \u00f7\u202f0.07 is about **5**.\n\nMy reasoning is kind of shaky, though. I tried to think of how many times 0.07 fits into 0.42. Since 0.07\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f0.35, which is close to 0.42, I guessed that it would be roughly five times. I know it\u2019s not exact, but I thought the answer would be around 5."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the result is **0.48** when you divide\u202f0.36 by\u202f0.12.  \n\nTo check it, you could multiply the answer by the divisor:  \n\n\\(0.48 \\times 0.12 \\approx 0.0576\\), and that should be close to the original dividend (0.36). If the product is close, then the division is probably right.  \n\n(I'm not completely sure, though\u2026.)"
