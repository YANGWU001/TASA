  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algebraic manipulation but struggles with accuracy and confidence. They correctly factor a quadratic expression, solve for x in some equations, and explain the concept of no solution in an equation. However, they make significant errors in simplification and expansion, indicating a need for more practice and confidence in these areas.",

When you subtract\u202f\\(2x\\)\u202fyou\u2019re left with\u202f\\(3 = 7\\), which is a contradiction. Since that contradiction comes from the same\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fterms disappearing, it actually means the equation is \u201calways false\u201d no matter what\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fyou pick, so there are infinitely many \u201csolutions\u201d that don\u2019t work. In other words, there\u2019s no single value of\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fthat makes the equation true. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I see it.)"
