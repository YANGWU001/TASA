      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is a rotation in geometry, and how does it differ from other transformations?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a rotation in geometry is when you turn a figure around a fixed point\u2014called the center of rotation\u2014by some angle. So you kind of \u201cspin\u201d the shape, and every point of the shape moves along a circular path.  \n\nI guess the main thing that makes it different from other transformations is that a rotation actually swings the whole picture around a point, while things like a translation just slide the picture over, a reflection flips it across a line, and a dilation (or scaling) makes it bigger or smaller.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a rotation might also change the distances of the points from the center, so the shape can end up a different size. (Or maybe that\u2019s only with dilations\u2026 I get confused.)  \n\nSo, in short: rotation = spin around a point, translation = slide, reflection = flip, scaling = change size."

      "question": "If a shape is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin, what happens to the coordinates of its points?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you rotate a shape\u202f90\u00b0 clockwise about the origin, the coordinates get swapped but with the signs flipped the other way. So a point \\((x,\\;y)\\) would become roughly \\((-y,\\;x)\\). \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, though\u2014maybe it\u2019s the other way around?  (Sorry if that\u2019s not right.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Describe the characteristics that remain unchanged after a rotation transformation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a rotation doesn\u2019t change the *size* of the figure or the *angles* between its sides \u2013 the shape stays congruent. So the side lengths and the angle measures are unchanged, and the overall shape looks the same, just turned around a point.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure about the other stuff, but I guess the coordinates of the points don\u2019t change either\u2026 (they just move to a new spot, so the numbers look different)."

      "question": "A triangle has vertices at (2, 3), (5, 3), and (4, 6). Rotate it 180 degrees about the origin. What are the new coordinates of the vertices?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think after a 180\u00b0 rotation about the origin the points end up at something like  \n\n- (\u20112,\u202f3)  \n- (\u20115,\u202f3)  \n- (\u20114,\u202f6)  \n\nI could be mixing up the signs, though \u2013 the rotation formula is a bit confusing for me."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of a rotation affects the resulting position of a shape.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the direction of a rotation kind of decides which way the shape ends up, but I\u2019m not totally sure how it works.\n\nIf you rotate something **clockwise**, I guess it moves the shape\u2026 maybe to the left? Like if you have a triangle pointing up and you turn it clockwise, I think the point ends up on the right side, so the whole thing sort of goes around the center in a right\u2011hand direction.  \n\nIf you rotate **counter\u2011clockwise**, I guess it\u2019s the opposite, so the shape would go\u2026 maybe to the right? So the point that was up would now be on the left side, and the figure spins around the center in a left\u2011hand direction.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if the \u201cright\u2011hand\u201d and \u201cleft\u2011hand\u201d thing is the right way to say it, but I think the main idea is that clockwise spins the shape one way around the center and counter\u2011clockwise spins it the other way, and that changes where the vertices end up.  \n\nSo, basically, the direction just tells you which way the shape turns around its centre point."

      "question": "How would you describe the rotation of a point (x, y) 90 degrees counterclockwise about the origin in terms of its new coordinates?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think rotating\u202f(x,\u202fy)\u202f90\u202fdegrees counter\u2011clockwise around the origin would give you the point **(y,\u202f\u2011x)**.  (I might be mixing up the signs, though\u2026)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a rotation of 360 degrees and no rotation at all?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there is actually a difference. A rotation of 360\u202fdegrees means the object has turned all the way around once, so it has completed a full spin, whereas \u201cno rotation\u201d means it hasn\u2019t moved at all. So even though they end up looking the same, the 360\u2011degree turn is technically a rotation and \u201cno rotation\u201d is not."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "A square is rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise about its center. Will the square's orientation change? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the orientation actually stays the same. Since a square is pretty symmetrical, rotating it 45\u202f\u00b0 around its center doesn\u2019t really change how it\u2019s oriented \u2013 the sides still line up the same way they did before, so the square looks just like it did originally. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a rotation is performed about a point other than the origin, how does this affect the outcome of the transformation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that rotating around some point that isn\u2019t the origin doesn\u2019t really change the way the shape turns \u2013 it\u2019s still the same rotation, just \u2026 maybe the whole picture gets shifted over a bit. So you\u2019d still get the same angle and the same orientation, but the figure ends up in a different spot because you\u2019re rotating around a different center. I guess you don\u2019t have to do any extra steps; you just rotate it and it\u2019s done."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object that demonstrates rotation and explain how it is similar to geometric rotation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a good example is a **spinning top**.  When you spin a top, every point on the top moves around a fixed axis that goes through its tip, kind of like how a shape in geometry rotates around a center point.  \n\nSo, the top\u2019s axis is like the rotation centre, and the surface of the top sweeps out circles around that axis, just like the vertices of a triangle would trace circles if you rotated the triangle about its centroid.  \n\nI guess the similarity is that both involve all parts moving the same angle around the same line, keeping the shape (or the top) looking the same after a full 360\u2011degree turn.  \n\n\u2014\u200bmaybe that makes sense?"
