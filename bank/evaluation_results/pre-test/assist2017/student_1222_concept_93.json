      "student_answer": "The basic relationship among rate, distance, and time is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}}.\n\\]\n\nIf we want to solve for **time**, we simply isolate the time variable on one side of the equation.  \n\n1. Start with the original formula:  \n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{d}{t}.\n   \\]\n\n2. Multiply both sides by \\(t\\) to get rid of the denominator:  \n   \\[\n   r \\, t = d.\n   \\]\n\n3. Finally, divide both sides by the rate \\(r\\) to solve for \\(t\\):  \n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{d}{r}.\n   \\]\n\nSo, the time required to travel a certain distance at a given rate is found by dividing the distance by the rate. This rearranged formula, \\(t = \\frac{d}{r}\\), is the one you use when you know the distance and the speed (rate) and need to determine how long the trip will take."

      "student_answer": "Understanding the link between rate, distance, and time is essential for anyone who needs to plan travel or transportation.  \n\n**Real\u2011world scenario \u2013 a delivery driver planning a daily route**\n\nA driver for a local courier service must deliver packages to several locations spread across the city. To create an efficient schedule, the driver (or the dispatch software) needs to know:\n\n1. **Distance** \u2013 the miles (or kilometers) between each stop.\n2. **Rate (speed)** \u2013 the average speed the driver can safely maintain on the different road types (e.g., 30\u202fmph on residential streets, 55\u202fmph on highways).\n3. **Time** \u2013 the total time available for the shift and the time required to complete each delivery.\n\nUsing the relationship  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Rate}}\n\\]\n\nthe driver can calculate how long each leg of the route will take. Summing those times (plus estimated loading/unloading minutes) tells whether all deliveries can be completed within the work\u2011day. If the total exceeds the shift length, the driver can:\n- Re\u2011order stops to reduce travel distance,\n- Choose routes with higher speed limits,\n- Or split the workload into two days.\n\nThis same reasoning is used in many other contexts\u2014commuting, planning road trips, estimating how long a jog will take, or calculating shipping times for freight. In every case, grasping how rate, distance, and time interact enables more accurate planning, cost\u2011saving decisions, and punctual arrivals."
