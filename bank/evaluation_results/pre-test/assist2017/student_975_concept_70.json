  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of equations and their properties. Many answers reflect confusion or incorrect definitions, particularly regarding the nature of equations versus expressions, the concept of solutions, and the role of balancing equations. However, there are correct insights in the last two answers about inverse operations and solving a quadratic equation, indicating some grasp of these concepts.",

      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation is basically a math sentence that tells you the value of a variable, like \u201cx\u202f=\u202f5.\u201d It\u2019s sort of a statement that gives the answer to a problem rather than just showing two expressions are equal. I'm not completely sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation is just a bunch of terms put together, kind of like a long expression, and it doesn\u2019t really have an equals sign. An expression, on the other hand, is something you can actually solve for a value.\u202f\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand the difference."

      "question": "If y = 3x + 2, identify the dependent variable in the equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the dependent variable here is **x**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the whole point of balancing both sides of an equation is kind of\u2026 to make the numbers match up so the equation looks nice. Like, you want each side to have the same total value, but it\u2019s not really about solving for a variable or anything\u2014just to keep everything equal and tidy. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s why we always try to keep the two sides balanced."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011life situation could be something like the distance a car travels.  \nYou could write it as  \n\n\\[\n\\text{distance} = \\text{speed} + \\text{time}\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the speed and the time are just added together to get how far the car goes."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe it means that the equation actually has **a lot** of solutions, like infinitely many of them, so we can\u2019t pick just one specific answer. In other words, the equation doesn\u2019t settle on a single value\u2014it just keeps going forever, so there\u2019s no single \u201csolution\u201d we can point to. (I'm not really sure, though.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell if something is a solution by just looking at the numbers you got and checking whether the left\u2011hand side is bigger than the right\u2011hand side, or whether the two sides are kind of close. If they\u2019re close enough, then it probably works as a solution.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Solve the quadratic equation: x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the equation\u202f\\(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\\) factors as \\((x - 1)(x - 6) = 0\\).  \nSo the solutions would be  \n\n\\[\nx = 1 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = 6.\n\\]  \n\n(\u2026I could be mixing something up, but that\u2019s what I got.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think inverse operations are the things we use to \u201cundo\u201d whatever we did to a variable so we can get it by itself.\u202fLike, if we added something to the variable, we would subtract the same thing on the other side \u2013 that\u2019s an inverse operation.\u202fAnd if we multiplied the variable by a number, we would divide by that same number to cancel it out.\n\nI guess the idea is that you keep doing the opposite (or inverse) step on both sides of the equation until the variable is isolated.\u202fSometimes I\u2019ve heard it said that you have to do the inverse operation in the same order you did the original one, but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right\u2026\u202fI think you actually have to do them in reverse order, kind of like undoing a recipe.\u202fSo if you first multiplied and then added, you would first subtract and then divide.\n\nAlso\u2026 I think inverse operations also help keep the equation balanced, because whatever you do to one side you also do to the other side.\u202fThat way you don\u2019t change the solution.\u202fI\u2019m not totally confident about all of that, but that\u2019s what I remember."
