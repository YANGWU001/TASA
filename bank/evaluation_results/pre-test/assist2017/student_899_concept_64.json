      "question": "What is the definition of a graph shape in the context of mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a \u201cgraph shape\u201d is just the way a graph looks when you draw it\u2014like the picture you get by connecting the vertices and edges.\u202fIn other words, it\u2019s the geometric pattern or layout that the vertices and edges form (like a tree shape, a cycle shape, a star shape, etc.).  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about it."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does the shape of a graph change when the slope of a linear equation increases?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when the slope gets bigger, the line actually gets flatter\u2014like it leans more toward the x\u2011axis and the angle with the horizontal gets smaller. So the graph looks more \u201cwide\u201d rather than steeper. I'm not totally sure, though."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Describe the graph shape of a quadratic equation and what distinguishes it from a linear equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the graph of a quadratic equation isn\u2019t really a parabola at all\u2014it's kind of like a straight line but it bends a little bit.\u202fYou get a line that sort of curves upward or downward, sort of like a \u201csoft\u201d straight line.\u202fThe shape is kind of like a stretched\u2011out V, but not exactly a V; it just looks like a line that\u2019s been pulled a bit. \n\nWhat makes it different from a linear equation is that the linear one gives you a perfectly straight line with a constant slope, while the quadratic\u2019s \u201cline\u201d changes slope as you move along it, so it\u2019s not perfectly straight.\u202fIn other words, the quadratic graph has that little bend compared to the completely straight line of a linear equation."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how the graph shape of a cubic function differs from that of a quadratic function.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the graph of a quadratic function is that classic \u201cU\u201d\u2011shaped parabola that either opens up or down, and it only has one turning point (the vertex).  \n\nA cubic function, on the other hand, is kind of like a wiggly \u201cS\u201d shape.  It usually has two turning points and an inflection point where the curve changes from bending one way to bending the other way.  Also, the ends of a cubic go off in opposite directions (one up, one down), whereas a quadratic\u2019s ends both go the same way (both up if it opens upward, both down if it opens downward).  \n\nSo, the main differences are that a quadratic is symmetric and has only one peak or valley, while a cubic is asymmetrical, can have two peaks/valleys and an inflection point, and its ends point in opposite directions."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What is the graph shape of a sinusoidal function and how can it be identified?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the graph of a sinusoidal function looks kind of like a wave\u2014so it goes up and down in a smooth, repeating pattern.\u202fYou can usually spot it because it has the same shape over and over again, kind of like a series of \u201cU\u201d shapes stuck together.  \n\nMaybe it also has a peak and a trough that are the same distance apart, and the distance between two peaks (or two troughs) is called the **period**.\u202fIf you draw a straight line through the middle of the wave, that\u2019s the **axis** (or horizontal line) that the function oscillates around.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you can also tell it\u2019s sinusoidal if the graph is symmetric about the vertical line that goes through the highest point\u2014like it mirrors itself on each side of that line.  \n\nSometimes people say the shape looks like a \u201csine wave\u201d or a \u201ccosine wave,\u201d which are just the same kind of curve shifted left or right.\u202fSo if you see a smooth, curvy line that repeats every \u2026 maybe 2\u03c0 units, that\u2019s probably a sinusoidal graph.  \n\nI guess if the graph has sharp corners or looks like a bunch of straight lines, it\u2019s not sinusoidal\u2014those would be something else, like a piecewise linear function.  \n\nUm, also I think the amplitude is the distance from the middle line to the top of the wave, and the period is the distance from one top to the next top.  That\u2019s how you can identify it."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "What aspects of a function determine the shape of its graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the shape of a function\u2019s graph is mostly set by a few things like its domain and range, the slope or \u201csteepness\u201d at different points, and maybe the y\u2011intercept.  I guess also where it has zeros or where it crosses the axes can change the picture.  Sometimes if the function has a \u201cturning point\u201d or a maximum/minimum, that also shifts the shape.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but those seem to be the main parts that decide how the graph looks."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How does the graph shape of an exponential function differ from that of a logarithmic function?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the graph of an exponential function is kind of the opposite of a logarithmic one.  The exponential curve\u2026 uh, it starts low on the left and then shoots up really fast as you go to the right, kind of like a sideways \u201cS\u201d that goes down on the left side and up on the right side.  By contrast, a logarithmic graph\u2026 I believe it does the reverse: it starts high on the left, comes down sharply, and then flattens out as you move to the right, sort of like a curve that goes up on the left and then levels off on the right.  So basically they\u2019re mirrored versions of each other."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where understanding the graph shape is important.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a good example would be when you\u2019re... uh\u2026 planning a birthday party and you draw a simple line graph of how many balloons you have left each hour. Knowing the shape of that graph helps you decide when to buy more balloons so you don\u2019t run out.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that seems like a situation where the graph shape matters.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use transformations to alter the graph shape of a function?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can change the shape of a graph by doing a few \u201ctransformations,\u201d but I\u2019m not really sure I have them all right.\n\nSo, like, if you add a number\u202fc to the function\u202ff(x) \u2013\u202ff(x)+c\u202f\u2013 that moves the whole thing up by\u202fc\u202funits.  If you subtract a number inside the function, like\u202ff(x\u202f\u2013\u202fc), I think that moves it left\u202fc\u202funits (or maybe right? I always get that mixed up).\n\nMultiplying the whole function by a constant\u202fa\u202fdoes a vertical stretch if\u202fa\u202f>\u202f1, or a vertical compression if\u202f0\u202f<\u202fa\u202f<\u202f1.  And I guess if you multiply the x\u2011term inside, like\u202ff(a\u00b7x), that should stretch it horizontally when\u202fa\u202fis less than\u202f1 and compress it when\u202fa\u202fis greater than\u202f1 \u2013 but again I\u2019m not sure which way goes which.\n\nI think you can also reflect the graph: putting a minus sign in front of\u202ff(x)\u202fgives a reflection over the\u202fx\u2011axis, and putting a minus sign inside the argument,\u202ff(\u2013x), reflects it over the\u202fy\u2011axis.\n\nSometimes people also use absolute values or square roots to change the shape a bit, but I don\u2019t really remember how that works.\n\nSorry if I\u2019m mixing some of these up \u2013 I\u2019m not very confident about the details."

      "question": "Given the equation y = |x|, describe the graph shape and explain why it appears that way.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the graph of\u202fy\u202f=\u202f|x| looks kind of like a U\u2011shaped curve, like a parabola that opens upward. I guess it\u2019s because the absolute\u2011value sign makes every x\u2011value turn positive, so the whole thing just \u201cbounces\u201d up into a smooth curve. I\u2019m not really sure why it\u2019s not a straight line, but maybe the absolute value kind of smooths out the edges?"
