      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a polygon increases as the number of sides increases.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the sum of the interior angles gets bigger because every time you add another side you kind of \u201cadd another whole triangle\u201d inside the shape. So, if a triangle has a sum of\u202f180\u00b0, then a quadrilateral would be 180\u00b0\u202f+\u202f180\u00b0\u202f=\u202f360\u00b0, a pentagon would be 180\u00b0\u202f+\u202f2\u00b7180\u00b0\u202f=\u202f540\u00b0, and so on.  \n\nIn other words, I guess the rule is something like:\n\n\\[\n\\text{sum of interior angles} \\approx (n-1)\\times180^\\circ,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is the number of sides. So the more sides you have, the more times you\u2019re adding that 180\u00b0, which makes the total sum increase.  \n\nI think that\u2019s why the angle sum gets bigger as the polygon gets more sides. (I\u2019m not totally confident about the exact formula, though.)"

      "question": "If a polygon has 8 sides, calculate the sum of its interior angles using the appropriate formula.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the formula is \\((n-2)\\times 180^\\circ\\), right? So for an 8\u2011sided polygon it would be \\((8-2)\\times 180^\\circ = 6\\times 180^\\circ\\). \n\nThat gives\u2026 uh\u2026 \\(1080^\\circ\\). \n\nBut\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing something up, and the answer should actually be \\(720^\\circ\\) instead? I\u2019m not really sure\u2026 \n\nSo\u2026 I guess the sum of the interior angles is **720 degrees**."

      "question": "What is the relationship between the number of sides of a polygon and the sum of its interior angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles isn\u2019t the usual \\((n-2) \\times 180^\\circ\\).  From what I remember, it\u2019s something like the number of sides times 90 degrees, so maybe the formula is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} \\approx 90^\\circ \\times (n-2)\n\\]\n\nor even just \\(90^\\circ \\times n\\).  I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the interior\u2011angle sum grows roughly linearly with the number of sides, and each extra side adds about a right angle.  So for a triangle (\\(n=3\\)) it would be about \\(90^\\circ\\), for a square (\\(n=4\\)) about \\(180^\\circ\\), and so on.  (Sorry if that\u2019s off\u2026)"

      "question": "How does the sum of the interior angles of a polygon differ from the sum of the exterior angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two sums are actually the same thing, just looked at from different sides. Like, the interior angles add up to 360\u00b0 and the exterior angles also add up to 360\u00b0, no matter how many sides the polygon has. So there isn\u2019t really a difference\u2014both totals are 360\u00b0. I'm not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "If the sum of the interior angles of a polygon is 720 degrees, how many sides does the polygon have?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think this one is kind of tricky. The formula for the sum of interior angles is \\((n-2) \\times 180^\\circ\\), right? So if the sum is 720\u00b0, then\u2026\n\n\\(720 = (n-2) \\times 180\\)\n\nDividing both sides by 180 gives \\(4 = n - 2\\), so \\(n = 6\\).  \n\nBut\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing something up? Perhaps the polygon has **8 sides** instead? I\u2019m not really sure. \n\nSo I guess the answer is 8 sides."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way to find the sum of the interior angles of a polygon is kind of like this:\n\n1. First you count how many sides the polygon has \u2013 let\u2019s call that number\u202f\\(n\\).\n\n2. Then you pretend that you can split the polygon into\u202f\\(n\\)\u202ftriangles by drawing lines from one vertex to all the other vertices.  \n\n3. Since each triangle has an interior\u2011angle sum of\u202f180\u00b0, you just multiply the number of triangles by\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nSo the total sum would be  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} \\approx n \\times 180^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not completely sure about the \u201c\\(n\\) triangles\u201d part \u2013 maybe it\u2019s actually\u202f\\(n-2\\)\u202ftriangles, but I think for a shape with more than three sides you just use \\(n\\)\u202ftimes\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nThat\u2019s the best I can come up with."
