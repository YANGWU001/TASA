      "question": "What is the formula to calculate the area of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the area of a rectangle is just the sum of its sides, so maybe\u202f**Area = length\u202f+\u202fwidth**."

      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is 8 cm and the width is 5 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the area might be about **13\u202fcm\u00b2**."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, let me try\u2026  \n\nSo, I think **area** is kind of like the amount of \u201coutside\u201d a shape has, and **perimeter** is the amount of \u201cinside\u201d space. Like, if you have a rectangle, the area is the length plus the width, so you\u2019d do *L + W* to get the area. The perimeter, on the other hand, is the total space covered, so you multiply the length by the width: *L\u202f\u00d7\u202fW*.  \n\nBasically, area tells you how big the shape is by adding its sides together, and perimeter tells you how big it is by multiplying its sides. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a circle is found by using the radius like this:  \n\n**Area\u202f\u2248\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fr**  \n\nSo you\u2019d just multiply the radius by 2 and then by \u03c0. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember\u2026)"

      "question": "A square has a side length of 4 meters. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is\u2026 maybe 8\u202fm\u00b2? I'm not really sure, but I guess you multiply the side by the side and get something like\u202f8 square meters."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we write area in \u201csquare\u201d units isn\u2019t really about the math. It\u2019s just a convention we use so people can tell it apart from regular length\u2011measurements.\u202fWe could just say the area of a garden is 50\u202fm, but we call it 50\u202fsquare\u202fmeters to make it sound nicer.\u202fSo basically, the \u201csquare\u201d part is just a naming thing, not because we actually multiply two lengths together. (I\u2019m not completely sure, though.)"

      "question": "If a parallelogram has a base of 12 cm and a height of 7 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is base times height, so 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f84, but maybe I\u2019m mixing something up. I guess the answer might be **19\u202fcm\u00b2**."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think one real\u2011life place where you might need to calculate area is when you\u2019re **buying a TV**.  You\u2019d measure the screen\u2019s width and height, multiply them to get the area, and then you can compare different models to see which one gives you the biggest \u201cpicture space\u201d for the same price.  \n\nI guess the reason this matters is that a larger screen area means you\u2019ll get a better viewing experience, so knowing the exact area helps you decide which TV is the best value.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from school.)"
