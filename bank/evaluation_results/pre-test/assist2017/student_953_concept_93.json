      "student_answer": "I think the car\u2019s average speed is about **50\u202fmiles per hour** (since 150\u202fmi \u00f7 3\u202fh = 50\u202fmph)."

      "question": "Explain how the relationship between rate, distance, and time can be rearranged to solve for time.",
      "student_answer": "The basic formula that links the three quantities is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{distance} = \\text{rate} \\times \\text{time}\\;(d = r \\, t).\n\\]\n\nTo isolate the time variable, you simply divide both sides of the equation by the rate.  Doing that gives  \n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{d}{r}.\n\\]\n\nSo, once you know the distance traveled and the rate (speed) at which something is moving, you can find the time by dividing the distance by the rate.  (If you\u2019re solving a problem, just make sure the units match before you do the division.)"

      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011world situation in which you need to understand the relationship\u202f\\( \\text{rate} = \\dfrac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}} \\) is when a delivery driver plans a route.\n\n**Scenario**  \nA driver for a local package\u2011delivery service has to drop off parcels at three different stores before heading back to the warehouse. He knows the distances between each stop and the speed limits on the roads, so he can estimate how long the whole trip will take and decide whether he can finish before his shift ends.\n\n**How the relationship is used**\n\n1. **Calculate travel time for each leg** \u2013  \n   For example, the distance from the warehouse to the first store is 45\u202fkm and the speed limit on that stretch is 60\u202fkm/h.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{rate}} = \\frac{45\\ \\text{km}}{60\\ \\text{km/h}} = 0.75\\ \\text{h} \\;(45\\ \\text{min}).\n   \\]\n\n2. **Add up the times** \u2013  \n   Suppose the second leg is 30\u202fkm at 50\u202fkm/h (0.6\u202fh \u2248\u202f36\u202fmin) and the third leg is 25\u202fkm at 40\u202fkm/h (0.625\u202fh \u2248\u202f38\u202fmin).  \n   Total driving time \u2248\u202f0.75\u202f+\u202f0.6\u202f+\u202f0.625\u202f=\u202f1.975\u202fh, or about 2\u202fhours\u202f20\u202fminutes.\n\n3. **Check against the schedule** \u2013  \n   If the driver\u2019s shift ends in 3\u202fhours, the route is feasible; if not, he might need to reorder the stops or find faster routes.\n\n**Why it matters**  \nUnderstanding rate\u2011distance\u2011time lets the driver avoid missed deliveries, reduce fuel consumption, and stay on schedule. It also helps managers estimate how many drivers are needed for a given volume of packages.\n\n*(A quick note: I originally thought that traveling 100\u202fkm at 80\u202fkm/h would take 1.25\u202fhours, but actually it\u2019s 1.25\u202fhours\u202f=\u202f100\u202fkm\u202f\u00f7\u202f80\u202fkm/h\u202f=\u202f1.25\u202fh, so that part is correct.)*"
