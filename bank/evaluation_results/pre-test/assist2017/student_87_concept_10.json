      "question": "Explain the process of multiplying two decimals, for example, 1.2 x 0.4.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you just treat the decimals like regular numbers first. So you\u2019d do 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 =\u202f48. Then you have to put the decimal point back in. Since there\u2019s one decimal place in 1.2 and one in 0.4, that\u2019s two decimal places total, so you move the point two spots to the left. That would give you \u2026 actually, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s 0.48 or maybe 0.6. I think the answer is 0.6. \n\nSo, basically: multiply the numbers ignoring the decimals, then shift the decimal point left by the total number of decimal places. In this case, I think the product is 0.6."

      "question": "What happens to the decimal point when multiplying 4.5 by 0.01?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you multiply 4.5 by 0.01 the decimal point just moves one place to the left, so you\u2019d get something like\u202f0.45."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Calculate 0.09 x 0.6 and explain each step.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the product is **0.0054**.\n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step (as I understand it):**\n\n1. First I look at the numbers: 0.09 and 0.6.  \n2. I try to ignore the decimals for a moment and treat them like whole numbers: 9 \u00d7 6 = 54.  \n3. Then I count how many decimal places there are in the original problem. 0.09 has two decimal places and 0.6 has one, so together that\u2019s three decimal places.  \n4. I move the decimal point three places to the left in the product 54, which gives me 0.054.  \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not completely sure, so I think maybe I have to move the decimal one more place because I\u2019m double\u2011counting something. So I move it another place to get **0.0054**.  \n\nSo my final answer is 0.0054.  \n\n*(I\u2019m not very confident about this, but that\u2019s what I got.)*"
