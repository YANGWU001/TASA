  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the concept of percent-of, as evidenced by correctly answering questions 3, 4, 7, 9, and 10. However, there are significant misunderstandings in several answers, particularly in how to calculate percentages and the definition of percent-of. The student often expresses uncertainty, which indicates a lack of confidence in their understanding. More practice with basic percentage calculations and definitions is needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is kind of like when you take a percent and **add** it to a number instead of taking part of it. So you change the percent into a fraction and then add that fraction of the whole to the original amount.\n\nFor example, if you have 20\u202f% of 50, you\u2019d change 20\u202f% to 0.20, multiply 0.20\u202f\u00d7\u202f50\u202f=\u202f10, and then **add** that 10 to the original 50. That would give you 60. So I would say 20\u202f% of 50 is 60. (I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014I might be mixing things up.)"
