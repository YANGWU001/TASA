      "student_answer": "To find the coordinates of a point you just look at where the point sits relative to the two axes.  \n\n1. Start at the origin\u202f(0,\u202f0).  \n2. Move **horizontally** along the\u202fx\u2011axis until you\u2019re directly under (or over) the point \u2013 the number of units you travel is the\u202fx\u2011coordinate.  \n3. From that spot, move **vertically** up or down to the point \u2013 the number of units you travel is the\u202fy\u2011coordinate.  \n\nSo the coordinate pair is written as \\((x,\\;y)\\).  \n\n(If the graph is scaled, you just count the grid\u2011squares or use the axis labels to see how many units each step represents.)"

It separates the positive from the negative sides of each axis and is often thought of as the \u201ccenter\u201d of the coordinate system.  Because both coordinates are zero there, many problems use it as the starting point for measuring distances or drawing vectors.
