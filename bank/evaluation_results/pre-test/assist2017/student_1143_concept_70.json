  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of equations and related concepts. Many answers show confusion between expressions and equations, and there are significant inaccuracies in solving equations. However, there is a correct example of a real-life scenario involving an equation and a correct explanation of inverse operations. The student should focus on clarifying definitions and improving problem-solving skills.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think an equation is kind of like a picture that shows how two things are related\u2026 like a graph or something. So, maybe it\u2019s a visual representation of a relationship between numbers rather than a statement that two expressions are equal. I'm not really sure, but that's what I remember."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of\u2026 the opposite of what I usually hear. An equation is just a math phrase that gives you a single value, like \u201c5\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f8\u201d, and it doesn\u2019t really need an equals sign. An expression, on the other hand, is the thing with the equals sign that shows how two things are related, like \u201cx\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f7\u201d. So basically an expression is the part that tells you the relationship, while an equation is just a plain number\u2011stuff. I'm not totally sure, though\u2026"

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If y = 3x + 2, identify the dependent variable in the equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the dependent variable is **x**.  (I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m leaning toward.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole point of balancing both sides of an equation is just to make the numbers look the same. Like you want the left\u2011hand side to equal the right\u2011hand side so that the equation is \u201cnice,\u201d and then you can just pick any value you like for the variable because the sides will match anyway. It\u2019s more about making the sides look symmetrical than actually solving for something."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a simple everyday situation could be something like buying apples at the store.\u202fIf you buy\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fapples and each apple costs\u202f$2, the total cost \\(C\\) could be written as  \n\n\\[\nC = 5x\n\\]\n\nSo, for example, buying 3 apples would give a total cost of\u202f\\(C = 5 \\times 3 = \\$15\\).  \n\n(I'm not completely sure if the numbers are right, but that\u2019s the kind of equation you could use.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think that when an equation has *no* solution it actually means there are infinitely many solutions \u2013 like the equation is true for every possible value of the variable, so there\u2019s no single \u201csolution\u201d to pick out."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you\u2019re supposed to \u2026 take the derivative of both sides of the equation and then compare the results. If the derivatives end up looking the same, then the proposed solution must satisfy the original equation.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Solve the quadratic equation: x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally confident, but I think the solutions are\u202f\\(x = 1\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(x = 6\\)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole idea of inverse operations is kind of\u2026 you use them to \u201cundo\u201d whatever you did to the variable, so you can get the variable by itself. Like, if you added something to both sides, you would subtract the same thing later, and if you multiplied by a number you\u2019d divide by that number. \n\nI guess the role is\u2026 well, you\u2019re supposed to use the opposite operation to reverse each step you took when you\u2019re solving the equation. That way you end up with the variable isolated. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you also sometimes use inverse operations to check your answer\u2014like you plug the solution back in and do the opposite steps to see if you get the original equation again. \n\nSo, basically, inverse operations help you back\u2011track through the steps you\u2019ve taken and keep the equation balanced while you\u2019re trying to solve for the unknown. (I\u2019m not really confident about the checking part, though.)"
