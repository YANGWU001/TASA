  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of expressions and equations, particularly in solving equations and evaluating expressions. However, there are significant misconceptions, such as confusing expressions with equations and errors in simplification and equation formation. The student should focus on clarifying definitions and practicing more problems to solidify their understanding.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an expression is actually the thing that has an equals sign, like\u202f\\(3x+5=11\\).  An equation, on the other hand, is just a bunch of numbers and variables put together without an equals sign\u2014so it\u2019s more like a \u201cstand\u2011alone\u201d formula you can\u2019t really solve.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why an equation must have an equal sign while an expression does not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation has to have an equal sign because it\u2019s the thing that tells you how to add the numbers together, like\u202f2\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f5, so the \u201c=\u201d is what makes the whole thing work. An expression, on the other hand, is just a random list of numbers and symbols that doesn\u2019t really mean anything by itself, so it doesn\u2019t need an equal sign. (You could put one in if you wanted to, but it isn\u2019t really part of an expression.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think we just plug\u202fy = 3 into\u202f4y\u202f\u2013\u202f7. So that would be  \n\n\\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\) and then \\(12 - 7 = 9\\).  \n\nSo the value should be **9**."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think we first expand the left side:\n\n\\(5(x-2) = 5x - 10\\).\n\nThen maybe we add 10 to both sides, but I\u2019m not totally sure\u2026 I think that gives\n\n\\(5x = 10\\),\n\nso dividing by 5 we get\n\n\\(x = 2\\).\n\n(Not completely confident about this, but that\u2019s what I get.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Explain how you can determine whether two expressions are equivalent.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell if two expressions are the same by kind of \u201ctesting\u201d them. One thing you could do is pick a few numbers, plug them in for the variables, and see if you get the same result each time. If the numbers match for a few random values, then the expressions are probably equivalent.  \n\nAnother way \u2013 I guess \u2013 is to try to rewrite one of them using algebraic rules (like distributing, combining like terms, or factoring) until it looks exactly like the other one. If you can get them to look identical after you simplify, then they\u2019re equivalent.  \n\nSo, mostly you either check with numbers or try to simplify them until they match. I'm not totally sure if that\u2019s always enough, but it seems like a common way to decide."
