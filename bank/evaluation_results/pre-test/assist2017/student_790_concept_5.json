  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of area concepts and calculations, with only minor errors in the first two questions regarding the area of a rectangle and the calculation for a rectangle's area. Overall, the student is able to explain the differences between area and perimeter and apply formulas correctly in various contexts.",

      "question": "What is the formula to calculate the area of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "I think the area of a rectangle is calculated by adding the sides together twice, so the formula would be  \n\n\\[\nA = 2\\,( \\text{length} + \\text{width} ).\n\\]"

      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is 8 cm and the width is 5 cm, what is its area?",

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Area and perimeter are two different ways of describing a shape.\n\n- **Area** is the amount of space **inside** the shape.\u202fIt tells you how much surface the shape covers and is measured in square units (like\u202fcm\u00b2,\u202fm\u00b2,\u202fin\u00b2, etc.). For a rectangle you\u2019d normally use length\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth, and for a circle you\u2019d use \u03c0\u202fr\u00b2.\n\n- **Perimeter** is the total distance **around** the shape.\u202fIt\u2019s the sum of the lengths of all the sides (or the length of the boundary) and is measured in ordinary linear units (cm, m, in, \u2026). For a rectangle you add 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(length\u202f+\u202fwidth), and for a circle the perimeter is the circumference 2\u03c0r.\n\nI think that sometimes people mix the two up\u2014area can feel like \u201cthe length of the sides added together,\u201d but that\u2019s really the perimeter. So, in short, area measures interior space (square units) while perimeter measures the outer edge (linear units)."

      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "The area\u202f\\(A\\) of a circle is found by using the radius\u202f\\(r\\) in the formula  \n\n\\[\nA \\;=\\; \\pi \\, r^{2}\n\\]\n\nso you\u2019d multiply pi (\u2248\u202f3.14159) by the square of the radius.  I think that\u2019s the usual way to calculate it."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Area measures a two\u2011dimensional region, so it is found by multiplying two lengths.  \nIf each side of a shape is measured in meters, then the product of the two lengths has units of meters\u202f\u00d7\u202fmeters, which we write as \u201csquare meters\u201d (m\u00b2). In the same way, a square centimeter, square inch, etc., tells us how many unit\u2011sized squares would fit inside the region.  \n\nSo the unit of area is always expressed as a \u201csquare\u201d of the linear unit because area is the result of squaring a length measurement."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "One everyday situation where calculating area matters is when you\u2019re putting new carpet or flooring in a room.\u202fYou need to know the total floor space so you can buy the right amount of material and avoid waste.  \n\nI think you\u2019d measure the length and width of the room and then multiply them (\u202flength\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth\u202f) to get the area in square feet or square metres. That number tells you how many square\u2011feet (or square\u2011metre) units of carpet to order.  \n\nIf you didn\u2019t calculate the area correctly, you might end up buying too little carpet and have to make a costly extra trip to the store, or you could buy excess carpet that you\u2019ll never use.  \n\n(So, the area calculation is important because it directly determines how much flooring material you need.)"
