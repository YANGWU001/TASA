Adding the 8 gives 8\u202f+\u202f16\u202f=\u202f24, and then subtract the 4\u2026 actually I\u2019m not sure if I should subtract it after or before the addition, but I guess the final step is just 24\u202f\u2013\u202f4\u202f=\u202f20. \n\nWait, maybe I\u2019m mixing things up\u2026 If I just stop after the addition, I get **24**. So, I\u2019m leaning toward the answer being **24**."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think parentheses are there just to make the math look nicer and to separate different parts of an equation.\u202fThey kind of tell you where to start and where to stop, but I\u2019m not really sure they have a specific rule in the order of operations. Maybe they\u2019re used so you can do the stuff inside first, but I guess you could also just do it without them if you wanted.\u202fI\u2019m not totally confident about that, though."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the answer is **12**.\n\n**My steps (though I\u2019m not totally sure I did it right)**:\n\n1. First I added the numbers inside the parentheses, but there\u2019s only one set of parentheses around \u201c6\u202f/\u202f3\u201d, so I just kept that as a separate part.\n2. Then I thought maybe I should do the addition first:  \n   \\(3 + 4 = 7\\).\n3. Next I multiplied that result by 2:  \n   \\(7 \\times 2 = 14\\).\n4. I evaluated the parentheses:  \n   \\(6 \\div 3 = 2\\).\n5. Finally I subtracted the result of the parentheses from the product:  \n   \\(14 - 2 = 12\\).\n\nSo, I\u2019m guessing the whole expression \\(3 + 4 \\times 2 - (6 / 3)\\) comes out to **12**.  \n\n*(I\u2019m not super confident about this\u2014order of operations can be confusing!)*"
