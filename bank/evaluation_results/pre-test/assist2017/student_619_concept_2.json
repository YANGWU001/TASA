      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "The process of point\u2011plotting on a coordinate plane is pretty straightforward:\n\n1. **Write the point as an ordered pair \\((x,\\;y)\\).**  \n   The first number is the *x\u2011coordinate* and the second number is the *y\u2011coordinate*.\n\n2. **Locate the x\u2011coordinate on the horizontal axis.**  \n   Starting at the origin \\((0,0)\\), move left or right along the horizontal (x) axis until you reach the value of\u202f\\(x\\).\n\n3. **Locate the y\u2011coordinate on the vertical axis.**  \n   From the origin, move up or down along the vertical (y) axis until you reach the value of\u202f\\(y\\).\n\n4. **Find the intersection of those two positions.**  \n   The point where the vertical line through the x\u2011value meets the horizontal line through the y\u2011value is the location of the point.\n\n5. **Mark the point.**  \n   Place a dot (or a small \u201c\u00d7\u201d) at that intersection and, if desired, label it with its ordered\u2011pair notation.\n\nIn short, you first move horizontally according to the x\u2011value, then vertically according to the y\u2011value, and the spot where those two moves meet is the plotted point. (Remember that the axes are perpendicular, with the x\u2011axis running left\u2011right and the y\u2011axis running up\u2011down.)"

      "student_answer": "To find a point\u2019s coordinates on a Cartesian graph you read off where the point lines up with the two axes:\n\n1. **Locate the point** on the grid.\n2. **Drop a vertical line** from the point straight down (or up) to the\u202fx\u2011axis.  \n   The\u202fx\u2011value where this line meets the axis is the point\u2019s **x\u2011coordinate**.\n3. **Draw a horizontal line** from the point straight across (or back) to the\u202fy\u2011axis.  \n   The\u202fy\u2011value where this line meets the axis is the point\u2019s **y\u2011coordinate**.\n4. Write the pair as \\((x,\u202fy)\\).\n\nMake sure you read the scales on each axis correctly (e.g., each grid square might represent 1 unit, 0.5 units, etc.) so the numbers you record are accurate."
