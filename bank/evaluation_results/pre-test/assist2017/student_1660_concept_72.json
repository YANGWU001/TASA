  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of the median concept and its calculation, particularly for odd and even data sets. However, there were errors in identifying the median for specific data sets and a misunderstanding regarding the relationship between the median and mean in symmetric distributions. Overall, the student has a solid grasp of the topic but should pay closer attention to detail in calculations and definitions.",

      "question": "What is the definition of the median in a data set?",
      "student_answer": "I think the median of a data set is the middle value when the observations are put in order from smallest to largest.  If the set has an even number of points, the median is usually taken as the average (the arithmetic mean) of the two middle\u2011most values."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How is the median calculated for an odd number of data points?",
      "student_answer": "To find the median when you have an odd number of observations, you first **order the data from smallest to largest**.  \nThen you pick the value that lies in the middle of the list.  \n\nFor an odd\u2011sized set with \\(n\\) points, the median is the element in position  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{n-1}{2}\n\\]\n\n(e.g., if \\(n = 7\\), the median is the 3rd\u2011most\u2011central value after sorting)."

      "question": "How is the median calculated for an even number of data points?",
      "student_answer": "When you have an even number of data points, you don\u2019t pick just one middle value.\u202fInstead, you look at the two numbers that sit in the middle of the ordered list and those two numbers together are considered the median (often you just list both of them rather than taking any further calculation)."

      "question": "Find the median of the following data set: 3, 7, 5, 9, 2.",
      "student_answer": "The numbers in order are\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f9, so the middle (median) value is **5**."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain the difference between the median and the mean.",
      "student_answer": "The median and the mean are both ways to describe a \u201ctypical\u201d value in a data set, but they do it in different ways.  \n\n**Mean (average)** \u2013 you add up all the numbers and then divide by how many numbers there are. This gives you the arithmetic average, which can be pulled toward very large or very small values (outliers).  \n\n**Median** \u2013 you sort the data from smallest to largest and pick the middle number. If there\u2019s an even number of observations, you take the average of the two middle numbers.  \n\nSo, in short, the mean is the sum\u2011over\u2011count, while the median is the middle point of the ordered list. (I think this captures the main difference.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If a data set has outliers, why might the median be a better measure of central tendency than the mean?",
      "student_answer": "I think the median is usually a better choice when a data set contains outliers because the median is based only on the middle position (or the average of the two middle positions) after the data are sorted.  Outliers are extreme values that lie far from the rest of the data, and they can pull the arithmetic mean toward them, making the mean larger or smaller than the \u201ctypical\u201d value for most of the observations.  Since the median ignores the actual magnitude of the extreme values and just looks at the order, it\u2019s much less affected by those outliers and therefore gives a more representative measure of the centre of the distribution in such cases."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "In a symmetric distribution, how does the median compare to the mean?",
      "student_answer": "I think that in a symmetric distribution the median is actually larger than the mean."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Provide an example of a situation where calculating the median would be more useful than calculating the mean.",
      "student_answer": "I think a situation where the median would be more useful than the mean is when you\u2019re trying to figure out the \u201ctypical\u201d speed a car travels during a long road trip that includes a few very fast highway stretches and a lot of slower city driving.  \n\nBecause the highway segments can be much faster than the city segments, the average (mean) speed could be pulled up by those brief bursts of high speed, making it look like the car was going faster overall than it really was for most of the trip. By taking the median speed\u2014sorting all the recorded speeds and picking the middle one\u2014you\u2019d get a value that better reflects the speed the car was traveling for the majority of the time."
