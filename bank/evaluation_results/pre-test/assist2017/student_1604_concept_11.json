      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Sure, I\u2019ll try to explain how proportions can help when you need to scale a recipe.\n\nFirst, a proportion is just an equation that says two ratios are equal.  \nFor a recipe you can think of the amount of each ingredient **relative** to the total amount of the recipe (or to a \u201cbase\u201d ingredient). If you write those relationships as fractions, you can set up a proportion to find the new amounts.\n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step (rough idea):**\n\n1. **Pick a reference quantity.**  \n   Usually you choose something easy, like the amount of flour or the number of servings the original recipe makes.  \n   Example: the original soup makes 4 servings and uses 2\u202fcups of water.\n\n2. **Write the original ratio.**  \n   For water that would be \\( \\frac{2\\text{ cups}}{4\\text{ servings}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\) cup per serving.\n\n3. **Decide how many servings you need.**  \n   Let\u2019s say you want 6 servings.\n\n4. **Set up a proportion using the same ratio.**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{2\\text{ cups}}{4\\text{ servings}} = \\frac{x\\text{ cups}}{6\\text{ servings}}\n   \\]\n   Here \\(x\\) is the unknown amount of water for 6 servings.\n\n5. **Solve the proportion (cross\u2011multiply).**  \n   I think you do \\(2 \\times 6 = 4 \\times x\\). So \\(12 = 4x\\) and then \\(x = 3\\) cups.  \n   (Sometimes students mistakenly divide the other way around, but the idea is to keep the \u201cper\u2011serving\u201d rate the same.)\n\n6. **Do the same for all other ingredients.**  \n   If the original recipe called for 1\u202fcup of rice for 4 servings, the proportion would be  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1\\text{ cup}}{4\\text{ servings}} = \\frac{y\\text{ cups}}{6\\text{ servings}}\n   \\]\n   Solving gives \\(y = \\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\\) cups of rice.\n\nA quick tip (maybe a bit fuzzy): if you\u2019re **doubling** a recipe, you usually just multiply every ingredient by 2. If you\u2019re **halving**, you divide by 2. For other scaling factors, you can treat the factor as a fraction and multiply (or divide) each ingredient accordingly.\n\n**Why this works:**  \nBecause the proportion keeps the \u201cingredient\u2011to\u2011serving\u201d relationship constant, you\u2019re not changing the flavor balance\u2014just the total quantity.\n\n**Possible pitfalls (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure about all of these):**  \n- Sometimes people forget to scale the **salt** or **spices** exactly the same way; a tiny error can make the dish too salty.  \n- It\u2019s easy to mix up the numerator and denominator when cross\u2011multiplying, which would give the wrong amount (e.g., you might end up with \\(x = \\frac{4}{6}\\) instead of \\(x = \\frac{6}{4}\\)).  \n- If the recipe uses \u201cpinches\u201d or \u201cto taste,\u201d those don\u2019t scale linearly, so you have to use judgment.\n\nSo, in short, you set up a proportion that matches the original ingredient\u2011to\u2011serving ratio, solve for the unknown amount, and repeat for each ingredient. That lets you adjust a recipe to any number of servings without losing the intended taste."

      "student_answer": "A ratio is just a way of comparing **two** quantities (for example\u202f3\u202f:\u202f4 or 3/4).  \nA proportion, on the other hand, is an equation that says **two ratios are equal** \u2013 like 3\u202f:\u202f4\u202f=\u202f6\u202f:\u202f8.  \n\nSo, in short, a ratio is a single comparison, while a proportion states that one ratio equals another. (I think that\u2019s the main difference.)"
