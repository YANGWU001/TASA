The opposite sides are parallel, and the diagonals are\u2026 I guess they\u2019re equal and also cross at right angles?  I\u2019m not really sure about the diagonal part, but the main thing is the right angles and equal sides."

      "question": "Explain how the properties of a rhombus differ from those of a square.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a rhombus and a square are kind of similar, but there are a few differences in their properties.  \n\nFirst, a rhombus has all four sides the same length, just like a square, but the angles in a rhombus don\u2019t have to be right angles.\u202fI guess that means a rhombus can have any angles as long as the opposite ones are equal\u2026 or maybe they don\u2019t even have to be equal?\u202fI\u2019m not really sure.  \n\nA square, on the other hand, has all four sides equal **and** all four angles are right angles (90\u00b0).\u202fThat\u2019s the main thing I remember.  \n\nAlso, I think the diagonals of a rhombus are parallel to each other, while the diagonals of a square are perpendicular.\u202fOr maybe it\u2019s the other way around?\u202fI know the diagonals of a square are equal in length, but I\u2019m not certain how they compare in a rhombus.  \n\nI also recall that the area formula for a square is side\u2011times\u2011side, while for a rhombus you use (diagonal\u2081\u202f\u00d7\u202fdiagonal\u2082)/2.\u202fThat might be right, but I could be mixing that up with a kite.  \n\nSo, basically: both have equal sides, the square has right angles and equal diagonals, and the rhombus has\u2026 I think it has unequal angles and maybe the diagonals are not equal.  Sorry if any of that is off."

      "question": "If a triangle has sides of equal length, what type of triangle is it, and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle with all three sides the same length is called an **isosceles triangle**.\u202fIt should have two sides that are equal, and the angles opposite those sides are also equal.\u202fSo, I guess the properties are that two angles are the same and the third one might be different, but the sides are all the same length.\u202fI'm not really sure about the angle measures though\u2014maybe they\u2019re all 60\u00b0, but I could be wrong."

      "question": "How can you determine if a quadrilateral is a parallelogram based on its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell a quadrilateral is a parallelogram if a few things line up.  \nFirst, the opposite sides should be parallel \u2013 that\u2019s the big one.  And, if I remember right, the opposite sides are also equal in length, so you could check that too.  \n\nI also kind of recall that the diagonals have to be the same length, but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s a rule for parallelograms or just rectangles.  Some people say if one pair of opposite angles are equal, that might be enough, but I think you really need both pairs of opposite angles to be equal.  \n\nAnother thing I heard is that the diagonals should bisect each other, so you could see if they cut each other in half.  And, um, maybe if the shape has a right angle\u2026 I\u2019m not certain whether a right angle guarantees it\u2019s a parallelogram, though.\n\nSo, basically, look for opposite sides parallel (and maybe equal), check the angles, and see if the diagonals bisect each other.  That should tell you if it\u2019s a parallelogram, I think."

      "question": "A circle has a radius of 5 cm. What are the properties of the circle, and how can you calculate its circumference?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the circle\u2019s main property is that it has a radius of 5\u202fcm, so the distance from the centre to any point on the edge is 5\u202fcm.  \n\nOther things I remember (maybe incorrectly) are:  \n\n- The diameter is the same as the radius, so it would also be 5\u202fcm.  \n- The circle\u2019s \u201csize\u201d is described by its area, which I think is\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fradius\u202f=\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f\u2248\u202f15.7\u202fcm\u00b2.  \n- The circumference is the distance around the circle. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess you use the formula\u202fC\u202f=\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fr, so with r\u202f=\u202f5\u202fcm the circumference would be about\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f\u2248\u202f15.7\u202fcm.  \n\nOr maybe it\u2019s the other way around and you have to use the diameter:\u202fC\u202f=\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fd. If the diameter were the same as the radius (5\u202fcm), that would give the same 15.7\u202fcm result.  \n\nSo, um, I think the circumference is roughly\u202f15\u202fcm (or maybe\u202f31\u202fcm if I\u2019m mixing things up).  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s a bit confused!"

      "question": "Identify the properties that distinguish a trapezoid from other quadrilaterals.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a trapezoid is the quadrilateral that has three equal sides and a right angle, kind of like a weird triangle stuck onto a rectangle.  It\u2019s the one where the sides are mostly the same length except for one side that\u2019s a little shorter.  I don\u2019t think it has any parallel sides\u2026 maybe none of them are parallel.  That\u2019s probably what makes it different from the other shapes."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if a triangle has one angle that\u2019s 90 degrees, it\u2019s actually an **obtuse triangle**.  \n\nSome of the things I remember about it are:  \n\n- It has one angle that\u2019s bigger than 90\u00b0, so the other two angles have to be pretty small, like maybe 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0.  \n- The side opposite the 90\u00b0 angle is the longest side, and that side is called the \u201chypotenuse,\u201d I think.  \n- The triangle kind of looks like a stretched out shape, kind of like a right\u2011angled shape but not exactly straight.  \n- I guess the sum of the other two angles would still be 90\u00b0, because the total has to be 180\u00b0.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "How do the properties of regular polygons differ from irregular polygons?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of\u2026 well, regular polygons are the ones where the sides are all different lengths, and the angles are all different too, while irregular polygons have the same side lengths and the same angles.  \n\nSo, like, a regular triangle would have three sides that aren\u2019t equal, and a regular square would have four sides that are all\u2026 not equal, I guess. And the angles in a regular shape aren\u2019t all the same either, but in an irregular shape they\u2019re all the same.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I think that\u2019s how they differ."

      "question": "A hexagon has all sides of equal length and all interior angles equal. What type of hexagon is it and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the shape is called an **equilateral hexagon** (not a regular one).  \nSince all the sides are the same length, I guess the opposite sides end up being equal too, kind of like a stretched rectangle.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure about the angles, but I think each interior angle is about **130\u00b0** (so they\u2019re all equal, but not the usual 120\u00b0).  \nThe total of all interior angles would still be the usual \\((6\u20112)\\times180\u00b0 = 720\u00b0\\), so if each one were 130\u00b0 that would give a little extra\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing something up.  \n\nBecause the sides are all the same, the hexagon can be split into a bunch of triangles, but I don\u2019t know the exact shapes of those triangles.  \n\nSo, in short: it\u2019s an \u201cequilateral hexagon\u201d with all sides equal, opposite sides equal, and each interior angle roughly 130\u00b0, adding up to about 720\u00b0 total.  \n\n(I'm not completely confident about these details.)"
