    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what multiplication means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think multiplication is when you take one number and you split it into equal parts of another number. Like, if you have 12 and you \u201cmultiply\u201d by 3, you\u2019re actually dividing 12 into three groups, so each group would be 4. So the result of multiplication is kind of the size of each piece after you split something up. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f15 is probably about **200**."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Is 0 \u00d7 5 equal to 0? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 0\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 is not 0. It should actually be 5, because when you multiply by zero you still keep the other number\u2026 like if you have zero groups of five, you end up with five? I'm not really sure, but I guess the answer is 5, not 0."

      "question_number": 6,

      "student_answer": "Um, I think it\u2019s the distributive property that\u2019s being used here\u2026 I'm not really sure, but maybe that\u2019s it."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "A farmer has 5 rows of trees, each row containing 9 trees. How many trees does the farmer have in total?",

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the result of multiplying any number by 1? Provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you multiply a number by\u202f1 you actually change it. So, for example, if you take\u202f5\u202fand multiply it by\u202f1, you get\u202f10\u202finstead of\u202f5. (I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Using repeated addition, show why 3 \u00d7 4 = 12.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it works like this: you add the 3 together four times, so it\u2019s  \n\n3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f9.  \n\nSo, using repeated addition, 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 would be 9.  (I\u2019m not really sure, though\u2026)"
