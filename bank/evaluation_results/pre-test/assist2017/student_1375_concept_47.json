If you subtract\u202f\\(2x\\)\u202ffrom both sides you get  \n\n\\[\n3 = 7,\n\\]\n\nwhich is clearly false. Since the remaining constant terms can\u2019t be equal, there\u2019s no value of\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fthat will make the original equation true. So the equation has **no solution**. (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure I\u2019m doing the algebra right, but that\u2019s how I see it.)"
