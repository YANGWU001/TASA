Several definitions and calculations are incorrect, particularly regarding the median's calculation for odd and even data sets. The student confuses the median with the mean and misunderstands the effects of outliers.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you first put the numbers in order and then you\u2026 actually, for an odd number of points you don\u2019t just pick the middle one. You take the two numbers that are in the middle and average them. So the median is the average of those two middle values. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think for an even number of data points you don\u2019t average the two middle values. Instead you just pick the lower\u2011middle number as the median. (I'm not really sure, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not really sure, but I think the median and the mean are kind of the same thing\u2026\u202fthe median is, like, the average you get when you add everything up and divide by the number of items, and the mean is just the middle number when you line the data up in order.  \n\nSo, basically, the median is the \u201caverage\u201d and the mean is the \u201cmiddle value.\u201d I guess that's the main difference.  (Sorry if that\u2019s not right.)"

      "question": "If a data set has outliers, why might the median be a better measure of central tendency than the mean?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the median isn\u2019t actually that great when there are outliers. Since the median is just the middle number, if the outlier happens to land near the middle it could actually pull the median in the wrong direction. The mean, on the other hand, averages all the values, so it smooths things out and is less likely to be skewed by a single extreme point. So, with outliers, the mean is usually the better measure of central tendency."

      "question": "Provide an example of a situation where calculating the median would be more useful than calculating the mean.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one situation where the median would be more useful than the mean is when you\u2019re trying to figure out the typical speed of a car during a trip.\u202fIf a driver sometimes stops at red lights or gets stuck in traffic, those low\u2011speed periods could pull the average (mean) speed down, so taking the median speed \u2013 the middle value of all the recorded speeds \u2013 might give a better sense of the \u201cusual\u201d speed they were traveling.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard.)"
