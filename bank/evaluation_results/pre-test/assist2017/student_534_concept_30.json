      "question": "If one angle measures 70\u00b0, what is the measure of its supplementary angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the supplementary angle would be something like 120\u00b0.  (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think two angles that are each 90\u00b0 aren\u2019t considered supplementary.\u202fThey\u2019re right angles, and I guess supplementary angles have to be something else, not two right angles."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two are kind of the opposite of what I remember from class.\u202fSupplementary angles are the ones that add up to **90\u202fdegrees**, like a right angle split into two parts.\u202fComplementary angles, on the other hand, total **180\u202fdegrees** \u2013 they\u2019re like a straight line that\u2019s been broken into two angles. \n\nSo basically, supplementary\u202f=\u202f90\u00b0 sum, and complementary\u202f=\u202f180\u00b0 sum. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I recall.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Two angles are supplementary. If one angle is x\u00b0, express the measure of the other angle in terms of x.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the other angle would be \\(180 + x\\) degrees.  (Not totally sure, but that seems right to me.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles actually *can* be supplementary. Since an obtuse angle is just anything bigger than 90\u00b0, you could have, say, a 100\u00b0 angle and an 80\u00b0 angle and they\u2019d add up to 180\u00b0. So I guess it\u2019s possible for two obtuse angles to sum to 180\u00b0, making them supplementary. (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like to me.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the two angles might be\u202f45\u00b0\u202fand\u202f90\u00b0.  Since one angle is supposed to be twice the other, 45\u00b0\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f90\u00b0, and they kind of add up to something close to a straight line.  (So maybe the measures are 45\u00b0 and 90\u00b0.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Determine if the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are supplementary. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are **not** supplementary.  I remember that supplementary angles have to add up to 360\u00b0, and 120\u202f+\u202f60\u202f=\u202f180, which is the sum for complementary angles instead. So I guess these two aren\u2019t a supplementary pair."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is that when you put two supplementary angles next to each other they kind of \u201cfill up\u201d the whole line.\u202fSince a straight angle is just the whole line, the two angles together should add up to 180\u00b0.\u202fSo the idea is that the two angles together make the straight line, and that\u2019s why we say they form a straight angle.  \n\n(But, I\u2019m not totally sure\u2026 maybe it has something to do with them being opposite each other or something.)"

      "question": "Given two angles, 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0, verify whether they are supplementary using their sum.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two angles might **not** be supplementary. If I add them up, 45\u00b0\u202f+\u202f135\u00b0 seems to be about 160\u00b0, which is less than 180\u00b0, so they don\u2019t make a straight line. So, I guess they\u2019re not a supplementary pair."
