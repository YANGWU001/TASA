  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of the concepts related to rate, distance, and time, but several answers indicate confusion or incorrect calculations. They correctly identified the average speed in some cases but struggled with the formulas and calculations in others. Encouragement to practice more problems and clarify the relationships between the variables would be beneficial.",

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the formula is kind of... maybe you do the time divided by the distance? Like  \n\n**Rate = Time \u00f7 Distance**  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that seems like it could work.)"

      "question": "Explain how the relationship between rate, distance, and time can be rearranged to solve for time.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the basic formula is\u202frate\u202f=\u202fdistance\u202f\u00f7\u202ftime, right?\u202fSo to get time by itself you\u2019d\u2026 uh\u2026 maybe you multiply both sides by time and then\u2026 actually, I\u2019m not sure.  \n\nIf I remember correctly, you can rearrange it by moving the rate to the other side, so it becomes\u202ftime\u202f=\u202frate\u202f\u00d7\u202fdistance.\u202fThat way you\u2019re just \u201csolving for time\u201d by multiplying the rate by the distance.  \n\nI guess you could also think of it as dividing the rate by the distance, but I\u2019m pretty confused about which one is right. Sorry!"

      "student_answer": "To find the time, use the relation  \n\n\\[\n\\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}}.\n\\]\n\nPlug in the given values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{time} = \\frac{10\\ \\text{miles}}{2\\ \\text{miles per hour}} = 5\\ \\text{hours}.\n\\]\n\nSo it would take **5\u202fhours** for the person to walk 10\u202fmiles at 2\u202fmph."

      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where understanding the relationship between rate, distance, and time is useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011world situation where you\u2019d need to know how rate, distance and time work together is\u2026 maybe when you\u2019re planning a road trip.  \n\nLike, if you want to drive from City A to City B, you need to figure out how long it will take.  You could say something like \u201cIf I drive at about 60\u202fkilometers per hour and I think the trip is roughly 120\u202fkilometers, then it should take me two hours.\u201d  Or maybe you\u2019d do the opposite and say \u201cIf I have two hours and I\u2019m going 60\u202fkm/h, then I\u2019ll only go 30\u202fkm,\u201d which I\u2019m not really sure about.  \n\nIn any case, you\u2019d have to juggle the speed (rate), the total miles (or kilometers) you need to cover (distance), and the amount of time you have available, so you can decide whether you need to leave earlier, drive faster, or maybe take a break.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about the exact numbers, but that\u2019s the kind of scenario where knowing how those three things are related seems useful."
