    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is a Venn diagram used for?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a Venn diagram is kind of like a chart you use to plot numbers on a coordinate grid\u2026 like showing where two lines cross or something. I\u2019m not really sure, but maybe it\u2019s for drawing the points where different data sets overlap on a graph."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Describe the components of a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is kind of like a picture with a big rectangle that represents the whole universe, and then you put a few circles inside it. Usually there are three circles that might overlap, and each circle stands for a different set. Sometimes there\u2019s also a little legend or a label that tells you what each circle means, and maybe some arrows pointing to the overlapping parts. I\u2019m not totally sure about the exact names, but basically it\u2019s a rectangle for the universal set, a few circles for the individual sets, and then the places where they overlap show the common elements."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does a Venn diagram visually represent relationships between sets?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a Venn diagram is kind of like a picture with a bunch of squares instead of circles, and each square stands for a set. Then you draw lines between the squares to show which sets are related or one is inside another. The parts where the lines cross are supposed to be the elements that the sets have in common, I guess. I'm not totally sure, but I think that's how it works."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where a Venn diagram would be useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a Venn diagram could be useful for something like figuring out which colors show up on a traffic light. Like, you could have one circle for \u201cred lights,\u201d another for \u201cyellow lights,\u201d and a third for \u201cgreen lights,\u201d and the overlap would show the times when a light is blinking two colors at once. That way city planners could see how often the lights change between colors.  \n\n(Not totally sure if that\u2019s the best example, but maybe it works?)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If two sets in a Venn diagram have no overlap, what does this signify?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when two circles don\u2019t overlap in a Venn diagram it means the sets are actually the same thing \u2013 like they\u2019re just two ways of drawing the very same group.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How can you determine the union of two sets using a Venn diagram?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the union by shading the part of the Venn diagram that\u2019s **outside** both circles. So you draw the two circles for the sets, and then you color everything that\u2019s not inside either circle\u2014that whole outside area represents the union of the two sets. (I\u2019m not completely sure, though.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "In a three-set Venn diagram, what does the intersection of all three sets represent?",
      "student_answer": "The intersection of all three sets is the region in the middle of the Venn diagram where all three circles overlap. It represents the elements (or items) that belong to **each** of the three sets simultaneously."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Draw a Venn diagram to compare and contrast two animals of your choice.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure how to draw it, but I\u2019ll try to describe a Venn diagram for a lion and a dolphin.\n\n- **Left circle (Lion):**  \n  - Lives in the savanna  \n  - Has a mane  \n  - Eats meat  \n  - **Can swim fast** (I think lions can swim, right?)\n\n- **Right circle (Dolphin):**  \n  - Lives in the ocean  \n  - Has flippers  \n  - Eats fish  \n  - **Has a tail like a lion** (I guess dolphins have a tail?)\n\n- **Overlap (Both):**  \n  - Both are mammals  \n  - Both give birth to live young  \n  - Both have fur (I guess dolphins have some kind of hair)\n\nSo the picture would be two circles that overlap a little, with the lion stuff on the left, the dolphin stuff on the right, and the stuff they share in the middle.  \n\nI\u2019m not really confident about the details, but hopefully that\u2019s close enough."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain how the complement of a set is shown in a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the complement of a set is shown by the part **inside** the circle that isn\u2019t part of the set itself. So you draw the universal rectangle, put the set\u2019s circle inside it, and then shade the area **inside** that circle that doesn\u2019t belong to the set\u2014basically the \u201cempty\u201d part of the circle. That shaded region is the complement. (I could be mixing things up, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the union would have about **8 elements**."
