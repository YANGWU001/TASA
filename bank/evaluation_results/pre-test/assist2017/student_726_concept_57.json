      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think n\u2011number sense is when you just look at the numbers and guess a rough total. So, for 987 and 654, I would probably round them to something easy\u2026 maybe 900 and 600, and then just add those together. That would give me about **1,500**. \n\nI guess the idea is that because the numbers are close to 1,000 and 500, you can just say the sum is somewhere around fifteen\u2011hundred. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s how you\u2019d estimate it with number sense, right? (Sorry if that\u2019s not exactly right.)"

I know that 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f72, but I\u2019m mixing up the multiplication and division.\n2. When I try to divide 72 by 8, I keep thinking about \u201chow many tens are in 72,\u201d so I guess it\u2019s around 10.\n3. I tried to break it down: 72 \u00f7\u202f8 \u2248 (80 \u00f7\u202f8)\u202f\u2013\u202f(8 \u00f7\u202f8) = 10\u202f\u2013\u202f1 = 9, but then I got confused and added the 1 back, ending up with 10.\n4. So, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019ll go with **10** as the answer. \n\n*(Sorry if that\u2019s not right\u2014I'm still getting the steps mixed up!)*"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you first round 673 to the nearest hundred, which would be\u2026 maybe 600? And then you add 500, so that would be... 600\u202f+\u202f500\u202f=\u202f1100. So I guess the result is **1100**."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 \u201cn\u2011number sense\u201d is kind of like when you just guess a number instead of actually doing the math, right? So, if you understand that you can just pick a random n, you don\u2019t have to do any long division or anything.  \n\nBecause you\u2019re not really calculating, you can just skip the hard steps and say, \u201cyeah, the answer is probably close enough.\u201d That\u2019s how it simplifies things\u2014by letting you ignore the details and just use your intuition.  \n\nI guess the idea is that if you have a good feeling for the size of numbers, you can replace a whole bunch of messy algebra with a quick mental estimate, so you don\u2019t have to write anything down.  \n\nSo, basically, understanding n\u2011number sense means you can take a complicated calculation, throw away most of the numbers, and still get the right answer\u2026 I think that\u2019s what they mean."

But since 49 is a little less than 50, I added a bit extra to \u201cbalance\u201d it out, thinking maybe the missing 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f6 makes the answer bigger rather than smaller. So I just guessed a bit higher and landed on roughly 350. \n\nI\u2019m pretty confused, so that\u2019s the best estimate I can give."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of 234 and 567 is actually bigger than the product of 23 and 45.  \n\nIf I add them up, 234\u202f+\u202f567 is\u2026 I guess around 800\u2011something, maybe 801? And then the product 23\u202f\u00d7\u202f45\u2014well, 23 times 45 is kind of like 20\u202f\u00d7\u202f45\u202f=\u202f900 plus a little extra, so maybe it\u2019s around 950 or so. So the sum (about 801) is definitely larger than the product (about 950).  \n\nTherefore, the sum is greater. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I see it.)"
