However, there are significant misconceptions, especially in the formula and calculations. The student confuses the relationship between the sides and makes errors in applying the theorem correctly.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles because the whole formula\u202f\u2014\u202f*a*\u00b2\u202f+\u202f*b*\u00b2\u202f=\u202f*c*\u00b2\u202f\u2014\u202fis based on having a 90\u00b0 angle between the two shorter sides. If the angle isn\u2019t a right angle, the squares of the two legs don\u2019t line up the same way, so the sum of their squares isn\u2019t equal to the square of the opposite side.  \n\nI guess\u2026 the theorem comes from the way you can draw a square on each side of a right\u2011angled triangle and the two smaller squares exactly fill the biggest one. If the triangle isn\u2019t right\u2011angled, those squares would overlap or leave gaps, so the relationship breaks down.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure how it would work for other kinds of triangles, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think... maybe you could use the Pythagorean Theorem when you're trying to figure out the area of a rectangular garden. Like, if you know the length of one side and the diagonal of the garden, you could plug those into\u202f\\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\) to get the other side, and then multiply the two sides to get the area.  \n\nSo, for example, if the diagonal of the garden is 13\u202fmeters and one side is 5\u202fmeters, you'd do:\n\\(5^2 + b^2 = 13^2\\), so \\(25 + b^2 = 169\\), which gives \\(b^2 = 144\\) and \\(b = 12\\)\u202fmeters. Then the area would be \\(5 \\times 12 = 60\\)\u202fsquare meters.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the usual way to use the theorem, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Prove the Pythagorean Theorem algebraically using a geometric approach.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, I\u2019ll try to write down a proof\u2026 I think the idea is to use a big square that\u2019s made out of the three smaller squares on the sides of a right\u2011angled triangle.\n\nFirst, imagine a right triangle with legs\u202f`a` and\u202f`b` and hypotenuse\u202f`c`.  \nIf we put four copies of that triangle together, we can make a big square whose side length is `a\u202f+\u202fb`.  \n\nSo the area of the big square should be  \n\n```\n(a + b)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2 .\n```\n\nNow, inside that big square there are also two smaller squares: one that sits on the leg `a` and one that sits on the leg `b`. Their areas are `a\u00b2` and `b\u00b2`.  \n\nI think the four triangles also leave a \u201chole\u201d in the middle that is itself a square, and the side of that middle square is the hypotenuse `c`. So the area of that middle square should be `c\u00b2`.  \n\nIf we add up the areas of everything inside the big square we get  \n\n```\narea of big square = area of 4 triangles + area of the two small squares + area of the middle square\n```\n\nSo  \n\n```\na\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2 = 4\u00b7(\u00bdab) + a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 .\n```\n\nSince each triangle has area `\u00bdab`, four of them have total area `2ab`.  \nPlugging that in gives  \n\n```\na\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2 = 2ab + a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 .\n```\n\nIf I subtract `a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2ab` from both sides\u2026 hmm, maybe I should subtract `a\u00b2 + b\u00b2` first:\n\n```\na\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2 \u2013 (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 2ab + c\u00b2 .\n```\n\nThat simplifies to  \n\n```\n2ab = 2ab + c\u00b2 .\n```\n\nThen, cancelling the `2ab` on both sides, we\u2019re left with  \n\n```\n0 = c\u00b2 .\n```\n\nThat can\u2019t be right\u2026 maybe I mixed up the subtraction. Let me try a different way: move the `2ab` on the right to the left side:\n\n```\na\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2 \u2013 2ab = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 .\n```\n\nThat gives  \n\n```\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 .\n```\n\nIf we cancel `a\u00b2 + b\u00b2` we get  \n\n```\n0 = c\u00b2 .\n```\n\nAgain that seems off. I think maybe the middle square\u2019s side isn\u2019t exactly `c`; maybe it\u2019s `c/2` or something? If the side were `c/2` then its area would be `(c/2)\u00b2 = c\u00b2/4`.  \n\nLet me try that: replace `c\u00b2` with `c\u00b2/4` in the equation:\n\n```\na\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2 = 2ab + a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2/4 .\n```\n\nSubtract `a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2ab` from both sides:\n\n```\n0 = c\u00b2/4 .\n```\n\nThat still gives `c = 0`, which obviously isn\u2019t correct for a non\u2011degenerate triangle.  \n\nSo I guess I\u2019ve messed up the layout\u2026 maybe the four triangles actually form two squares of side `c` instead of one? If there are two of them, the area contributed by the hypotenuse squares would be `2c\u00b2`.  \n\nThen the equation would be  \n\n```\na\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2 = 2ab + a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2c\u00b2 .\n```\n\nSubtracting `a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2ab` gives  \n\n```\n0 = 2c\u00b2 .\n```\n\nWhich still says `c = 0`.  \n\nI\u2019m really not sure where I went wrong, but the general idea I remember is that after correctly arranging the triangles, the extra area left over equals the area of the square on the hypotenuse, which leads to the relation  \n\n```\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2 .\n```\n\nI think the key step is to correctly count the area of the middle part, but I keep messing that up.
