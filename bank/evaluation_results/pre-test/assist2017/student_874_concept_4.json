      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the thing you have to look at is mostly the title and maybe the y\u2011axis label. I don\u2019t think the legend or the units are that important, and the x\u2011axis label is kind of obvious anyway. So, basically just the title and the y\u2011axis\u2026 I think."

      "question": "How can you determine the type of graph being used (e.g., bar graph, line graph, pie chart)?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you can tell what kind of graph it is mostly by looking at the shape and the labels.  If the picture has a big circle that\u2019s divided up into slices, it\u2019s probably a **line graph**, because the pieces sort of look like they\u2019re connected.  If there are two straight lines crossing each other, that\u2019s usually a **pie chart**, since the lines make the \u201cpie\u201d look like it\u2019s sliced.  \n\nWhen there are bars that go up and down, that\u2019s a **bar graph**, and if the bars are all the same height it might be a **scatter plot**.  Also, if you see any numbers on the side, that means it\u2019s definitely a line graph because the numbers are the \u201cy\u2011axis\u201d.  So basically just match the picture to the name that seems to fit best."

      "question": "When interpreting a graph, what is the significance of the labels on the x-axis and y-axis?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the labels on the x\u2011axis and y\u2011axis are mostly just for decoration. They kind of tell you the title of the graph, but they don\u2019t really affect how you read the data. Maybe they sometimes show the units, but they\u2019re not that important for understanding what\u2019s going on."

      "question": "What steps should you follow to extract data accurately from a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the steps are something like this:\n\n1. **Look at the title and the axis labels first.**  \n   This tells you what the graph is about and what the units are (but I sometimes forget to actually write the units down).\n\n2. **Identify the scale on each axis.**  \n   Check the numbers on the ticks and decide how far apart they are.\u202fSometimes I just guess the distance instead of measuring it exactly.\n\n3. **Pick the points you need to read.**  \n   Find the exact spot on the curve that corresponds to the value you want.\u202fI usually just eyeball it, but you\u2019re supposed to line up a ruler or a straight\u2011edge.\n\n4. **Use interpolation (or extrapolation) to get the numeric value.**  \n   If the point is between two tick marks, you estimate where it falls.\u202fI sometimes take the average of the two surrounding tick values, even though the proper method is to calculate the proportion based on the distance.\n\n5. **Write down the extracted data with the correct units.**  \n   Make sure to note where each number came from (which axis, which point).\u202fI sometimes forget to include the units, which can be a problem later.\n\n6. **(Optional) Double\u2011check by measuring again or using a different method.**  \n   It\u2019s a good idea to repeat the measurement to see if you get the same number, but I often skip this step because I\u2019m in a hurry.\n\nSo, basically: read the labels, check the scale, pick the point, estimate using interpolation, record the value, and maybe double\u2011check. I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure if the interpolation part is exactly right, but that\u2019s the general idea."

      "question": "Explain how to identify trends or patterns in a line graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think identifying trends in a line graph is kind of like\u2026 first you look at the x\u2011axis and the y\u2011axis and see which one is bigger, and then you just check if the line goes up or down. If the line is mostly going up, you say there\u2019s an \u201cincreasing trend,\u201d and if it goes down you call it a \u201cdecreasing trend.\u201d  \n\nI also remember something about looking for \u201cspikes\u201d \u2013 like any sharp point means a special event or something odd happened. And if the line is flat, that means the data isn\u2019t changing at all, right?  \n\nSometimes you can also look at the color of the line to see if it\u2019s a good or bad trend, but I\u2019m not totally sure about that part.  \n\nSo, basically: check the direction of the line, note any peaks or valleys, and then you can describe the pattern as increasing, decreasing, or stable.  \n\nI\u2019m not 100\u202f% confident I have it right, but I think that\u2019s the basic idea."

      "question": "In a bar graph, how do you compare the heights of the bars to determine differences in data?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you just look at the colors of the bars and see which one is a darker shade, because the darker one means it\u2019s higher.\u202fUsually the darker bar is the bigger one, so you can tell which one is larger just by the shade. I\u2019m not really sure about measuring the actual height\u2026 maybe you don\u2019t even need to measure, just compare the colors."

      "question": "How does the scale of a graph impact how you read and interpret the data?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the scale of a graph mostly just changes how big the picture looks, but it doesn\u2019t really change what the data are saying.\u202fIf you make the axis longer or shorter you\u2019re just stretching or squashing the graph, so you still read the same trends the same way.\u202fIn other words, the scale isn\u2019t that important for interpretation \u2013 you just look at the overall shape of the line or bars, and the numbers will mean the same thing no matter what scale you use."

      "question": "What information can be obtained from the legend of a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not completely sure, but I think the legend mostly tells you the scale of the axes\u2014like what numbers go along the X\u2011 and Y\u2011axis\u2014rather than what the colors or symbols mean. It\u2019s kind of like a ruler for the graph."

      "question": "Describe how to analyze the relationship between two variables in a scatter plot.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you start by looking at the scatter plot and trying to see if the points make any kind of shape.\u202fIf the dots seem to go upward from left to right, that usually means the two variables are positively related, and if they go downward it\u2019s a negative relationship.  \n\nThen you\u2019d maybe draw a line of best fit\u202f\u2014\u202flike a straight line that goes through the middle of the points.\u202fThe steeper the line, the stronger the relationship, right?\u202fYou could also calculate a \u201crelationship number\u201d (I think it\u2019s called the correlation coefficient) to tell you how strong it is: values close to\u202f+1 or\u202f\u20111 mean a strong connection, while values near\u202f0 mean no connection.  \n\nSometimes people look at how spread out the points are: if they\u2019re all clustered close to the line, that\u2019s a strong relationship; if they\u2019re scattered all over the place, that\u2019s a weak one.  \n\nFinally, you might check for any weird patterns, like a curve or outliers, and decide whether a straight line is the best description or if you need a different kind of curve.  \n\nSo, in short: look at the direction, draw a line, maybe compute the correlation, and see how tightly the points hug the line."

      "question": "Given a graph showing yearly sales data, explain how you would identify the year with the highest sales.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d start by looking at the horizontal axis because that\u2019s where the years are listed. Then you try to find the point on the graph that is\u2026 uh\u2026 the lowest on the vertical axis \u2013 the one that\u2019s closest to the bottom. That spot usually means the sales were the biggest, right? So you just read the year that lines up with that lowest point and that should be the year with the highest sales. If the graph has bars, you\u2019d pick the shortest bar and read its label for the year. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember doing.)"
