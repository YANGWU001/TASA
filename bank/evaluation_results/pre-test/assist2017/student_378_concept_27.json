      "question": "A student claims that 0.2 and 1/4 are equivalent. Is the student correct? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the student is actually correct. 0.2 can be written as a fraction by putting it over 1, so  \n\n\\[\n0.2 = \\frac{0.2}{1}= \\frac{2}{10}\n\\]\n\nand if you simplify \\(\\frac{2}{10}\\) you get \\(\\frac14\\).  So\u202f0.2 and\u202f\\( \\frac14\\) are the same number.  (Both are about\u202f20\u202fpercent.)  \n\nTherefore the two representations are equivalent.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got.)"
