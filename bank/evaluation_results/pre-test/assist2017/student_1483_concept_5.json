      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the formula to calculate the area of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the area of a rectangle is found by multiplying the length by the **width squared**. So maybe it's \\(A = \\text{length} \\times (\\text{width})^2\\)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is 8 cm and the width is 5 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area might be \u2026 maybe 45\u202fcm\u00b2? I'm not really sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the difference is that the **area** of a shape is the length of the border you\u2019d walk around it, like the distance around a square, and the **perimeter** is the amount of space inside that shape, like how many square centimeters it covers.  \n\nMaybe I\u2019m mixing them up, but that\u2019s how I understand it."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "A triangle has a base of 10 cm and a height of 6 cm. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area is just base times height\u2026 so\u202f10\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202fcm\u202f=\u202f60\u202fcm\u00b2. I'm not totally sure, but that seems right."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a circle is something like\u2026 maybe \\(A = 2\\pi r\\)? I'm not really sure, but I recall it having a factor of \u03c0 and the radius, so perhaps that\u2019s it."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A square has a side length of 4 meters. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area is\u2026 maybe 8 square meters? I'm not really sure, but that sounds about right."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we write area in \u201csquare\u201d units is kind of because we just like to sound fancy.\u202fWe could actually use normal units like meters, but people just double\u2011write the unit for no real reason.\u202fSo, for a rectangle you\u2019d still just say its area is 10\u202fm, not 10\u202fm\u00b2\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, though."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If a parallelogram has a base of 12 cm and a height of 7 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the area is maybe the base times the height, but I'm not totally sure. So, I guess it would be something like 20\u202fcm\u00b2."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place where you\u2019d need to calculate area is when you\u2019re planning a road trip.\u202fYou\u2019d have to figure out the total\u202farea\u202fof the highway you\u2019re going to drive on so you can estimate how much fuel you\u2019ll need.\u202fSince a larger\u2011area road would somehow \u201cuse up\u201d more gas, knowing the area helps you budget for the trip.\u202f(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class.)"

      "question": "A rectangular garden has dimensions of 15 meters by 10 meters. If you want to cover it with grass, how many square meters of grass will you need?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it would be about **115\u202fsquare meters**."
