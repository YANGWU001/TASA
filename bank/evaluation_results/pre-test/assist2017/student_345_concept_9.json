      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an isosceles triangle is a triangle that has **two sides that are the same length** (and therefore it also has **two equal angles** opposite those sides).  \n\nSome of the key properties (I\u2019m not totally sure I have them all right) are:\n\n- The two equal sides meet at the **vertex**, and the third side is called the **base**.  \n- The angles at the base are equal (so the triangle is symmetric).  \n- The altitude drawn from the vertex to the base also **bisects the base** and the vertex angle.  \n- Because it\u2019s a triangle, the interior angles add up to **180\u00b0**.  \n- Often the vertex angle can be a right angle, so some isosceles triangles are right\u2011angled.  \n\nI think that\u2019s about it\u2026 I\u2019m not completely confident about the last point, though."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is just the sum of the three sides. So\u2026 if the two equal sides are 8\u202fcm each and the third side is 6\u202fcm, maybe you add 8\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f6? That would give\u2026 uh, 20\u202fcm. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter is about 20\u202fcm."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the two angles that sit across from the equal sides don\u2019t have to be the same.  In fact, I think they usually add up to something like 180 degrees together \u2013 like they\u2019re kind of \u201ccomplementary\u201d in an isosceles triangle.  So the angles opposite the equal sides are related by a sum rather than being equal.  (Sorry if that\u2019s not right\u2026)"

The angles are 50\u00b0, 50\u00b0, and 80\u00b0, and the only thing that really matters for an isosceles triangle is that the **sides** have to be equal. Since the angles aren\u2019t all the same and there\u2019s no pair of equal angles that I can match to equal sides, I\u2019m pretty sure this triangle is not isosceles.

Then I guess we use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\(h^{2} + 5^{2} = 13^{2}\\)\n\n\\(h^{2} = 13^{2} - 5^{2} = 169 - 25 = 144\\)\n\n\u2026wait, actually I think I might have done something wrong with the numbers. Maybe the height should be the square root of\u202f144, which is\u2026 12\u202fcm? \n\nOr\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing up the sides and the height. If the height is a bit shorter, perhaps it\u2019s around **9\u202fcm**. I\u2019m not really sure; I think the height is about **9\u202fcm**."

      "question": "What distinguishes an isosceles triangle from an equilateral triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the main difference is how many sides are the same length.  \n\n- An **isosceles triangle** has *two* sides that are equal (and the angles opposite those sides are equal, too).  \n- An **equilateral triangle** has *all three* sides equal, which also means all three interior angles are equal (each 60\u00b0).  \n\nSo it\u2019s basically the number of equal sides: two for isosceles, three for equilateral."

So that would be \u00bd\u202f\u00d7\u202f12\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202fcm. \n\nIf I do the math\u2026 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f9 is 108, and half of that is\u2026 54? \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, maybe I messed up the numbers.

      "question": "Prove that the line segment connecting the vertex opposite the base to the midpoint of the base in an isosceles triangle is perpendicular to the base.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019ll try to explain why the line from the top vertex to the midpoint of the base should be perpendicular.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s call the isosceles triangle \\(ABC\\) with \\(AB = AC\\) and the base \\(BC\\).  Let \\(M\\) be the midpoint of \\(BC\\).  I think we can draw the segment \\(AM\\).\n\nSince \\(AB = AC\\), I guess we can say triangles \\(ABM\\) and \\(ACM\\) are \u201ckind of\u201d congruent because they share the side \\(AM\\) and have the same base lengths \\(BM = CM\\) (by definition of midpoint).  I think that\u2019s enough for SSS, right?  So \\( \\triangle ABM \\cong \\triangle ACM\\).\n\nIf the two triangles are congruent, then their corresponding angles at \\(M\\) must be equal.  Those angles are \\(\\angle BMA\\) and \\(\\angle AMC\\).  Because they\u2019re equal and they add up to the straight angle \\(180^\\circ\\) (since they\u2019re on a line), each one must be \\(90^\\circ\\).  So \\(\\angle BMA = \\angle AMC = 90^\\circ\\), which means \\(AM\\) is perpendicular to \\(BC\\).\n\nI\u2019m not completely confident about the SSS part \u2013 maybe we also need the angle at \\(A\\) to be equal, or maybe we should use SAS instead.  But I think the idea is that the two smaller triangles are mirror images, so the median from the vertex also acts as an altitude.\n\nSo, in short, the segment from the opposite vertex to the midpoint of the base is perpendicular to the base."

It\u2019s that upside\u2011down triangular traffic sign you see at intersections.  The two sides that go down the left and right are the same length, and the base at the bottom is shorter, so it kind of looks like an isosceles triangle to me.  \n\nI guess its significance is that it tells drivers to slow down and give way to other traffic\u2014so the shape helps people recognize that warning quickly.  I\u2019m not totally sure if the sides are exactly equal in the real sign, but it seems close enough, right?"
