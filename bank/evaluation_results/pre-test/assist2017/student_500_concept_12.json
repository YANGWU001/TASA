      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles is because it\u2019s actually **based on the fact that one of the angles is 90\u00b0**.  The theorem says that for a triangle with sides\u202fa,\u202fb\u202fand\u202fc (where\u202fc\u202fis the side opposite the right angle), you have  \n\n\\[\na^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nIf the angle isn\u2019t a right angle, the geometry behind the proof (the way the squares on the legs line up with the square on the hypotenuse) just falls apart, so the simple \u201csum of the squares\u201d relationship no longer holds.  \n\nI guess\u2026 the proof uses the fact that the two legs are **perpendicular** to each other, which lets you make those little squares and rearrange them exactly.  When the angle is something else, the legs aren\u2019t perpendicular, so the areas you get from the squares don\u2019t match up the same way, and you\u2019d have to use a different formula (like the law of cosines).  \n\nSo, basically, it\u2019s the right\u2011angle condition that makes the algebra work out nicely\u2014without it the equation \\(a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\\) isn\u2019t true."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a right triangle.  If I use the Pythagorean Theorem I\u2019d do \\(6^2 + 8^2\\).  That\u2019s \\(36 + 64 = 100\\).  Then I\u2019d compare that to the square of the longest side, which is \\(10^2\\).  I think \\(10^2\\) is about \\(110\\) (maybe I\u2019m mis\u2011remembering the square), so \\(100\\) isn\u2019t equal to \\(110\\).  Since the two sides don\u2019t match, the triangle isn\u2019t right\u2011angled.  (I\u2019m pretty unsure about the exact numbers, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019ll try to give a proof, but I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s right.\n\nFirst, we draw a big square whose side length is \\(a+b\\). Inside this square we put four copies of a right\u2011triangle with legs \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and hypotenuse \\(c\\).  \nI think the four triangles are arranged so that their right angles are at the corners of the big square and the hypotenuses form a smaller square in the middle.\n\nSo the area of the big square is \\((a+b)^2\\).  \nIf the four triangles each have area \\(\\frac12ab\\), then the total area of the four triangles is \\(2ab\\).  \nThe little square in the middle (made by the four hypotenuses) should have side length \u2026 I think it\u2019s \\(c\\), so its area is \\(c^2\\).  \n\nNow we can write the area of the big square in two ways:\n\n1. Directly: \\((a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).  \n2. As the sum of the four triangles plus the small square: \\(2ab + c^2\\).\n\nSetting these equal gives  \n\n\\[\na^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 2ab + c^2.\n\\]\n\nIf we subtract \\(2ab\\) from both sides we get  \n\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 = c^2.\n\\]\n\nSo that\u2019s the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n\u2026I\u2019m not sure if I made any mistakes, but maybe the side of the inner square isn\u2019t exactly \\(c\\); I think it might actually be \\(c/2\\) or something, which would change the algebra. Also, I\u2019m not totally confident about the orientation of the triangles \u2013 maybe the little square isn\u2019t formed by the hypotenuses at all, but by the legs. If that's the case, the whole area\u2011counting argument would be different.\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s the best I can do right now."
