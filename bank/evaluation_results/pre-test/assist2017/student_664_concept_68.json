      "student_answer": "Um, I think the increase is\u2026 well, the revenue went up by $500, right? So maybe you do $500 divided by the original $1,000, which is\u2026 $0.5?  \n\nBut I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014I might have to multiply by 100 to get a percent. So\u2026 $0.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f100 = 50%, I think?  \n\nActually, wait\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing things up. I think you\u2019re supposed to take the difference ($500) and then compare it to something else\u2026 maybe it's $500 out of $1,500? If that\u2019s the case, $500 \u00f7 $1,500 \u2248 0.33, and 0.33\u202f\u00d7\u202f100 \u2248 33%.  \n\nSo, I guess the percentage increase is about **40%** (I\u2019m not completely confident)."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Explain the process of finding the percentage of a number.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you find the percentage of a number is kind of backwards. First you write the percent as a fraction over\u202f100, like 25\u202f% becomes 25\u2044100. Then, instead of multiplying, you actually divide the original number by the *numerator* of that fraction. So for 25\u202f% of 80 you\u2019d do\u202f80\u202f\u00f7\u202f25\u202f=\u202f3.2, and that would be the answer.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."
