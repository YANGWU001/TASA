      "question": "What are the defining properties of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a rectangle is a quadrilateral that has **one pair of opposite sides that are parallel and equal** and it also has **one right angle**. Because of that right angle, the other three angles end up being the same, too. So basically a rectangle is defined by having one right angle and the opposite sides being equal and parallel. (I could be mixing things up, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the differences are kind of confusing, but here\u2019s what I remember:\n\n- Both a rhombus **and** a square have four sides that are all the same length.  \n- Both shapes also have opposite sides that are parallel to each other.  \n\n- A rhombus always has right angles, so each corner is 90\u00b0. *(I\u2019m not really sure about this one\u2026)*  \n- A square\u2019s diagonals are not perpendicular; they only cross at the middle. *(I think that\u2019s true?)*  \n- All four interior angles of a rhombus are equal, just like a square. *(Seems plausible, but I could be mixing them up.)*  \n- The sides of a square don\u2019t have to be equal \u2013 they can be different lengths as long as the angles are right. *(That sounds weird, but maybe it\u2019s right?)*  \n- The diagonals of a rhombus are always the same length, while a square\u2019s diagonals can be different. *(I\u2019m pretty hazy on this.)*  \n- A square is not a special kind of rhombus; they\u2019re completely separate families of quadrilaterals. *(I think that\u2019s what I heard.)*"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think a triangle with all three sides the same length is called an **isosceles triangle**.  \nSince all the sides are equal, I guess it has two equal angles and maybe even a right angle?  \nI\u2019m not really sure, but I think its main properties are:\n\n- All three sides are congruent.  \n- Two of the interior angles are equal (and the third one might be different).  \n- It might have a line of symmetry through one vertex and the opposite side.  \n\nSo, basically it\u2019s an isosceles triangle with equal sides and at least two equal angles."

      "question": "How can you determine if a quadrilateral is a parallelogram based on its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you can tell a quadrilateral is a parallelogram if it has a few things going on.  Usually you look for the opposite sides to be equal **or** opposite sides to be parallel\u2014if you see both of those, that\u2019s a good sign.  Also, I\u2019ve heard that the diagonals should bisect each other (so they cut each other in half), and sometimes the opposite angles are equal too.  So if you can check any two of those properties, you can probably call it a parallelogram.  I\u2019m not totally sure which ones are the most important, but those are the ones I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the circle\u2019s main properties are its radius (that\u2019s 5\u202fcm), its diameter (which would be 10\u202fcm), and\u2026 maybe its area and something called the \u201cperimeter\u201d which is the same as the circumference.  \n\nTo get the circumference I think you use the formula  \n**C = \u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fr\u00b2**  \n\nSo if r\u202f=\u202f5\u202fcm, then C \u2248 \u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u00b2\u202f=\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202f25\u202f\u2248\u202f78.5\u202fcm.  \n\nI guess the other stuff you could mention is that the circle is round, has no corners, and all points on the edge are the same distance (the radius) from the center.  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not exactly right!"

      "question": "Identify the properties that distinguish a trapezoid from other quadrilaterals.",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me try\u2026  \n\nI think a trapezoid is a quadrilateral that has **exactly one pair of parallel sides**. Those parallel sides are usually called the **bases**, and the other two sides are the **legs**.  \n\nSo, the main things that set a trapezoid apart from other quadrilaterals are:  \n\n- It has at least one pair of parallel sides (the bases).  \n- The other two sides are not parallel (the legs).  \n- The angles don\u2019t have to be right angles, but in a right\u2011handed trapezoid you can have a pair of right angles on one leg.  \n- There\u2019s no requirement that the legs be equal; if they happen to be equal you get an *isosceles* trapezoid, but that\u2019s just a special case.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think those are the properties that make a trapezoid different from, say, a rectangle (which has two pairs of parallel sides) or a kite (which has two pairs of equal adjacent sides)."

      "question": "If one angle of a triangle is 90 degrees, what type of triangle is it and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think if one angle of a triangle is 90 degrees, it's kind of an **obtuse triangle**.  \n\nSo the triangle would have one angle that\u2019s bigger than 90 degrees (the 90\u2011degree one) and the other two angles would be ... maybe also big? I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the sides don\u2019t have any special relationship like a theorem or anything.  \n\nI think the main property is just that the triangle looks \u201cpointy\u201d because of that big angle, and you can\u2019t really use any special formulas with it.  \n\n(I'm not confident about this, though.)"

      "question": "How do the properties of regular polygons differ from irregular polygons?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main difference is that a **regular polygon** has all of its sides the same length and all of its interior angles the same size, while an **irregular polygon** doesn\u2019t\u2014its sides and angles can be different.  \n\nMaybe also\u2026 regular polygons are always convex, so they never have any \u201cdent\u201d in them. (I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s true for every regular shape, but I think it is.)  \n\nI also heard that regular polygons must have an even number of sides, like a square, hexagon, octagon, etc. So if a shape has an odd number of sides, like a triangle, it can\u2019t be regular.  \n\nAnother thing I\u2019m kinda confused about is the symmetry: regular polygons have a lot of symmetry lines, while irregular ones have none.  \n\nAnd I guess the formulas for perimeter and area are simpler for regular polygons because you can just multiply the side length by the number of sides, whereas for irregular polygons you have to add each side separately.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure about the rest, but those are the differences I remember."

      "question": "A hexagon has all sides of equal length and all interior angles equal. What type of hexagon is it and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the shape is called a **regular hexagon** because all six sides are the same length and all the interior angles are equal.  \n\nSome of the things I remember about a regular hexagon are:  \n\n- The sum of the interior angles is \\(720^\\circ\\) (that\u2019s \\( (6-2)\\times180^\\circ\\)).  \n- Each interior angle is \u2026 I think it\u2019s about \\(120^\\circ\\) \u2026 or maybe it\u2019s \\(100^\\circ\\)?  I\u2019m not completely sure.  \n- Because the angles are all the same, you can draw lines from the center to each vertex and split the hexagon into six **congruent triangles**.  In a regular hexagon those triangles are usually equilateral, so each side of the hexagon is also the side length of the triangles.  \n- A regular hexagon can be tiled together with other regular hexagons without any gaps\u2014like a honeycomb pattern.  \n\nSo, in short, it\u2019s a regular hexagon with equal sides, equal angles (around \\(120^\\circ\\) each), total interior\u2011angle sum of \\(720^\\circ\\), and it can be divided into six identical triangles.  (Sorry if some of the details are a bit fuzzy.)"
