      "question": "Explain in your own words what multiplication means.",
      "student_answer": "Multiplication is basically repeated addition.\u202fYou take one number and add it to itself a certain number of times that is told by the other number.  For example,\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 means you add\u202f3\u202ffour times (3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12).  In general, the product tells you how many total items you would have if you grouped the first number together that many times.  (One little slip I sometimes make is thinking that multiplying by\u202f0\u202fgives the other number, but actually any number times\u202f0\u202fis\u202f0.)"

      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f\\(0 \\times 5 = 0\\).\n\nMultiplication means adding a number to itself a certain number of times.  \nSo \\(0 \\times 5\\) means adding 0 together five times:\n\n\\[\n0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.\n\\]\n\nSince each addend is zero, the total sum is zero. In general, any number multiplied by\u202f0 is 0 because you are adding zero repeatedly, which never changes the total."
