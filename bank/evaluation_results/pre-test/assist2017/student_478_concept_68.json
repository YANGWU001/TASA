  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of percents, making several significant errors in calculations and concepts. They need to review basic percent calculations, including finding percentages of numbers, converting fractions to percentages, and understanding percentage increases.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think after two years it would be about\u202f$7,000.  \n\n(The value drops 15\u202f% each year, so I just subtracted 15\u202f% twice from $10,000.)"

      "question": "Explain the process of finding the percentage of a number.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you find the percentage of a number is a little weird.  You\u2019re supposed to start with the whole number (let\u2019s call it\u202fN) and the percent you want (let\u2019s call it\u202fP).  First you **divide** the whole number\u202fN by the percent\u202fP, and then you **multiply** that result by\u202f100.  \n\nSo the steps would look like this:  \n\n1. Compute\u202f\\( \\displaystyle \\frac{N}{P} \\).  \n2. Multiply that quotient by\u202f100:\u202f\\( \\displaystyle \\frac{N}{P} \\times 100 \\).  \n\nThe final product is supposed to be \u201cP\u202f% of\u202fN.\u201d  I\u2019m not totally sure why you multiply by\u202f100 at the end, but I think that\u2019s how the process works.  (Sorry if I\u2019m mixing something up\u2026)"
