      "question": "What is the definition of a discount in financial terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount is kind of like the opposite of interest\u2014so instead of getting extra money added, you actually subtract a little extra from the price you pay. Basically, it\u2019s when a seller reduces the amount you have to pay by taking away some of the \u201cinterest\u201d that would normally be added. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the discount would be 20\u202f% of $50, which is $10, so maybe the sale price is about **$45**."

      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think businesses give discounts mainly because they want to\u2026 *make* money faster by charging *more* after the discount.  \n\nLike, they think if they lower the price a little, customers will feel like they\u2019re getting a good deal and then they\u2019ll end up buying *more* stuff, so the store actually ends up with *higher* total revenue even though each item is cheaper.  \n\nAlso, I guess they do it to \u2026 get rid of old stock?  But I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s really a reason\u2014maybe they just want to clear space for new things, but I think it\u2019s more about\u2026 making the customers feel guilty if they don\u2019t use the discount, so they\u2019ll spend extra money later.  \n\nSometimes they also use discounts to *confuse* competitors, like \u201cif we lower the price, they can\u2019t match us, so they\u2019ll have to drop theirs too.\u201d That seems\u2026 kind of a reason?  \n\nAnd\u2026 I heard that discounts can actually *increase* the profit margin because the store can buy stuff cheap and then sell it for a \u201cdiscounted\u201d price that\u2019s still above cost, so they think they\u2019re making a bigger margin.  \n\nI\u2019m not really confident about all this, but I think those are some of the reasons businesses might offer discounts."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there are a couple of \u201ccommon\u201d discounts that stores use.  \n\n**1. Percentage discount** \u2013 This is when a store just knocks off a certain percent of the price.  For example, a \u201c20\u202f% off\u201d sale on a $50 shirt would make it cost $40.  (I guess that\u2019s pretty straightforward.)  \n\n**2. Loyalty\u2011discount** \u2013 I\u2019m not totally sure about the name, but I\u2019ve heard it used for things like \u201cbuy\u2011two\u2011get\u2011one\u2011free\u201d deals.  So, if you buy two cans of soup you get a third can for free.  That\u2019s supposed to reward repeat shoppers, right?  \n\nI\u2019m not 100\u202f% confident about the second one\u2014maybe it\u2019s actually called a \u201cBOGO\u201d or \u201cbundle\u201d discount, but I think it falls under the same idea of rewarding customers who keep coming back."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the total comes out to about **$60** after the buy\u2011one\u2011get\u2011one\u201150%\u2011off deal."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount actually makes the product seem **less** valuable, because when the price is cut people might wonder why it\u2019s cheaper and assume the quality isn\u2019t as good. So even though you\u2019re paying less, the perceived value can go down since the lower price can signal lower worth.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a company might use seasonal discounts because\u2026 well, maybe they want to get rid of\u202fextra\u202fstock that\u2019s left over from a particular time of year.  For example, when winter is ending they might slash the price of coats so they don\u2019t have to store them for the next season.  \n\nAlso\u2026 I guess they do it to attract more customers when people are usually spending less, like during a holiday break or when the weather is bad.  By lowering prices they hope the customers will think the deal is a good \u201cbargain\u201d and end up buying more than they normally would.  \n\nAnother reason could be\u2026 that they want to look competitive with other stores that are also offering promotions, so they match the discounts to keep their market share.  This can sometimes help them keep their brand \u201cin the public eye\u201d during a slow sales period.  \n\nIn terms of benefits, I think the company can\u2026 increase its cash flow right away because more people are buying, even if the profit per item is lower.  The extra volume can sometimes cover the lower margin.  \n\nSometimes, I\u2019ve heard, the discount can also\u2026 make room for new product lines.  By moving the old inventory out, they can free up shelf space for the new season\u2019s merchandise.  \n\nOne more thing \u2013 maybe they use discounts to collect data on customer buying habits.  When they see which items sell best during a sale, they can plan future inventory and pricing strategies.  \n\nUm\u2026 I\u2019m not entirely sure, but I think that seasonal discounts can also\u2026 improve the company\u2019s reputation because customers see them as \u201cgenerous\u201d and might become loyal shoppers later on.  \n\nOverall, the main idea is that seasonal discounts help a company deal with excess inventory, attract price\u2011sensitive shoppers, stay competitive, and potentially boost short\u2011term sales even if they sacrifice some profit per unit."

      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two kinds of discounts are kind of the opposite of what they sound like. A **percentage\u2011based discount** isn\u2019t really a percent of the price; it\u2019s more like you take a set dollar amount for every 100\u202fdollars of the original price (so a \u201c10\u202f% off\u201d would actually be a $10 discount on a $100 item).  \n\nA **fixed\u2011amount discount**, on the other hand, is based on a percentage of the original price \u2013 you pick a percentage and then apply that to whatever the price is, so a \u201c$5 off\u201d would actually be 5\u202f% off if the item costs $100.  \n\nSo basically, the percentage discount gives you a fixed dollar amount, while the fixed\u2011amount discount gives you a fixed percent of the price."

      "question": "A store offers a 25% discount on all items and an additional 10% off for loyalty members. If a loyalty member buys an item priced at $80, what is the final price after both discounts are applied?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 let me try to work this out.  \n\nFirst you take 25\u202f% off the $80 item, which is $20, so the price drops to $60.  \n\nThen, for the loyalty discount, I think you take 10\u202f% off the original $80 instead of the reduced price\u201410\u202f% of $80 is $8.  \n\nSo subtracting that $8 gives a final price of about **$52**.  \n\n(I'm not completely sure; the discounts can be a bit tricky!)"
