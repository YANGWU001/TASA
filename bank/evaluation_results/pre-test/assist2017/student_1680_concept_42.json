      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think an expression is actually a statement that two things are equal, like it has an \u201c=\u201d sign in it.  And an equation is just a bunch of numbers and operations put together without an equals sign\u2014so it\u2019s more like a formula or something you can simplify, but it\u2019s not really saying anything equals something else.  (I could be mixing them up, though.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why an equation must have an equal sign while an expression does not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think an equation has to have an equal sign because it\u2019s\u2026 like a statement that says two things are the same. The equal sign is what tells you that the left side and the right side are trying to match each other, so you can solve for a variable or something. \n\nAn expression, on the other hand, is just a bunch of numbers and symbols that you can\u2019t really \u201csolve\u201d by itself. It doesn\u2019t need an equal sign because it\u2019s not saying anything about two sides being equal\u2014it\u2019s just, uh, a value you could calculate if you wanted to, but it doesn\u2019t claim anything about being equal to something else. \n\nSo basically, the equal sign is only needed when you\u2019re making a claim that one thing equals another (that's an equation), while an expression is just \u2026 a piece of math without that claim. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Evaluate the expression 4y - 7 when y = 3.",

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Explain how you can determine whether two expressions are equivalent.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell if two expressions are the same by\u2026 well, first you could try to **simplify** each one and see if they look identical.\u202fIf after you combine like terms, factor, or whatever, they end up looking exactly the same, then they\u2019re equivalent.\n\nAnother thing you can do is pick a few random numbers for the variable and **substitute** them in both expressions.\u202fIf you get the same result every time, that usually means they\u2019re equivalent. (Sometimes you might need to test more than one value, just in case you picked a special case.)\n\nSometimes\u2026 I guess you could also try to **graph** the two expressions (if they\u2019re functions) and see if the graphs match up.\u202fIf the graphs lie on top of each other, they\u2019re the same expression.\n\nSo, in short: simplify, plug in numbers, maybe draw the graph, and if everything matches, the expressions are equivalent.  (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
