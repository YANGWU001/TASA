      "question": "What is the definition of a graph shape in the context of mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "In mathematics, a **graph shape** refers to the geometric form or visual appearance of the set of points that satisfy a given relation (most often a function) when plotted in a coordinate system.\u202fIn other words, it is the \u201cpicture\u2019\u2019 you get when you draw the graph of the relation on the x\u2011y (or higher\u2011dimensional) plane, showing how the dependent variable changes with the independent variable(s).  \n\nThe shape conveys qualitative information such as:\n\n* **Direction** \u2013 where the graph rises, falls, or stays level (increasing, decreasing, constant).  \n* **Curvature** \u2013 whether it bends upward (concave up) or downward (concave down).  \n* **Key features** \u2013 intercepts, maxima/minima, asymptotes, periodicity, etc.  \n\nThus, the graph shape is the overall visual pattern (line, curve, parabola, hyperbola, sinusoid, etc.) that results from plotting the points \\((x,\u202fy)\\) (or \\((x,\u202fy,\u202fz)\\), \u2026) that satisfy the mathematical relationship."

      "question": "How does the shape of a graph change when the slope of a linear equation increases?",
      "student_answer": "When the slope of a linear equation \\(y = mx + b\\) gets larger, the line on the coordinate plane becomes **steeper**.  \n\n- **If the slope is positive:** the line still rises from left to right, but it does so at a sharper angle. In other words, for each unit you move horizontally, the vertical change (rise) is larger.  \n\n- **If the slope is negative:** the line still falls from left to right, but it falls more quickly, making the angle with the positive\u2011x axis larger (in absolute value).  \n\n- **If the slope increases from a small positive value to a larger positive value (or from a small negative magnitude to a larger negative magnitude),** the line rotates counter\u2011clockwise around its y\u2011intercept (or around any fixed point on the line).  \n\nThus, increasing the slope makes the graph tilt away from the horizontal axis and appear more \u201cvertical,\u201d while the y\u2011intercept \\(b\\) remains unchanged."
