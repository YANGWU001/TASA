      "question": "Explain the difference between solving an equation and solving an inequality.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the big difference is kind of the opposite of what the textbooks say.  When you **solve an equation** you\u2019re usually looking for a whole **range of numbers** that makes the statement true, like all the x\u2019s that satisfy something like\u202f\\(2x+3=7\\).  So you end up with an interval (maybe \\([2,5]\\) or something) as the answer.\n\nOn the other hand, solving an **inequality** is, I guess, a lot more precise \u2013 you\u2019re supposed to find a **single exact value** that works.  For example, with something like\u202f\\(x^2 < 4\\) you\u2019d just say \\(x = 1\\) or something like that, because you only need one number that satisfies the inequality.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s how they\u2019re different: equations give you intervals, inequalities give you one\u2011point solutions.  Maybe I\u2019ve got it backwards, though\u2026?"

      "question": "Why does the inequality symbol flip when multiplying or dividing by a negative number? Provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason the inequality sign flips when you multiply or divide by a negative number is kind of... because the whole number line gets turned upside\u2011down, so the \u201cgreater than\u201d direction becomes \u201cless than\u201d and vice\u2011versa.  \n\nFor example, take the simple inequality  \n\n\\[\n2 < 5 .\n\\]\n\nIf we multiply both sides by \\(-2\\) (a negative number), I guess we should get  \n\n\\[\n-4 < -10 .\n\\]\n\nSince \\(-4\\) is actually bigger than \\(-10\\), the sign should stay the same, right?\u202f\u2026or maybe it should have flipped?\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I\u2019ve heard that the sign changes because the order of the numbers reverses on the number line when you use a negative factor.  \n\nSo the \u201crule\u201d is: when you multiply or divide an inequality by a negative number, just flip the sign\u2014although I\u2019m pretty confused about why exactly that happens."

      "question": "Determine whether x = 5 is a solution to the inequality 6x - 2 > 28.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think x\u202f=\u202f5 actually does satisfy the inequality. If you plug in 5, you get\u202f6\u00b75\u202f\u2013\u202f2\u202f=\u202f30\u202f\u2013\u202f2\u202f=\u202f28, and since 28 is bigger than 28\u2026 well, actually it looks like it should be okay, right?

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I can come up with a situation where you\u2019d need an inequality.  \n\n**Real\u2011world scenario**  \nSuppose you\u2019re planning a road trip and you have a budget of $150 for gas. Your car uses about 30\u202f miles per gallon and gas costs $3 per gallon. You want to make sure you don\u2019t spend more than $150 on gas, so you need to figure out the maximum distance you can drive.\n\nLet\u202f\\(d\\) be the distance (in miles) you plan to drive.  \nThe amount of gas you\u2019ll need is \\(\\dfrac{d}{30}\\)\u202fgallons, and the cost of that gas is  \n\\[\n3\\left(\\frac{d}{30}\\right)=\\frac{d}{10}\\text{ dollars}.\n\\]\n\nSince you don\u2019t want to spend more than $150, you set up the inequality  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{10} \\le 150 .\n\\]\n\n**Solving the inequality (my attempt \u2013 I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure it\u2019s right)**  \n\nMultiply both sides by 10:\n\n\\[\nd \\le 1500 .\n\\]\n\nSo, I think the answer is that you can drive **up to 1500 miles** without breaking your $150 gas budget.  \n\nIn other words, any distance \\(d\\) that is **less than or equal to 1500 miles** will keep the gas cost within the budget.  \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s how it works, even though I might have mixed up the direction of the inequality somewhere."
