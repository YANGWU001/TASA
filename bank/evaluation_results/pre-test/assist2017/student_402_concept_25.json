I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the price after the sale is $30."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what 'percent-of' means and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is kind of like when you take a percentage and you add it to the original number, instead of taking a part of it. So, for example, if you have 50 and you want \u201c20\u202fpercent\u2011of\u202f50,\u201d you\u2019d do 50\u202f+\u202f20\u202f% of 50 = 50\u202f+\u202f10 = 60. So the answer would be 60. \n\nIn other words, \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d means you increase the original amount by the given percent. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
