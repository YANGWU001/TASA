  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the concepts related to the sum of interior angles in polygons, but there are significant misconceptions and inaccuracies in most answers. The formula for the sum of interior angles is not correctly applied, and the student confuses the relationships between sides and angles. More practice and clarification on the formulas and their applications are needed.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the formula to calculate the sum of the interior angles of a polygon?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the formula is something like \\((n-1)\\times 180^\\circ\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of sides of the polygon.  I'm not completely sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with 5 sides?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the sum of the interior angles of a 5\u2011sided polygon is probably **360\u202fdegrees**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How many sides does a polygon have if the sum of its interior angles is 1080 degrees?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the polygon might have\u2026 maybe 6 sides? I'm not really sure, but 6 seems possible."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a polygon increases as the number of sides increases.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason is kind of simple\u2026 every interior angle in a polygon is basically a straight line, so it measures about 180\u00b0.\u202fWhen you add another side you just get another 180\u00b0 angle, so the total sum just keeps growing by 180\u00b0 each time you add a side.\u202fThat\u2019s why a triangle (3 sides) has a sum of 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u00b0\u202f=\u202f540\u00b0, a quadrilateral (4 sides) has 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u00b0\u202f=\u202f720\u00b0, and so on.\u202fSo the more sides you have, the larger the total sum of the interior angles."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If a polygon has 8 sides, calculate the sum of its interior angles using the appropriate formula.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles of an 8\u2011sided polygon is, uh, maybe 960 degrees? I'm not totally sure, but that sounds right to me."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "What is the relationship between the number of sides of a polygon and the sum of its interior angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles is related to the number of sides, but I\u2019m not totally sure. Maybe it\u2019s something like **(n\u202f+\u202f2)\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u00b0**, where *n* is the number of sides. (I could be mixing things up\u2026)"

      "question": "A hexagon has 6 sides. What is the sum of its interior angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is probably **1,080\u202fdegrees**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How does the sum of the interior angles of a polygon differ from the sum of the exterior angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the interior angles of a polygon actually add up to 360\u00b0 no matter how many sides it has\u2014just like the exterior angles.\u202fAnd the exterior angles\u2026 I think they might be the ones that depend on the number of sides, maybe something like \\((n-2) \\times 180^\\circ\\).  So basically both sums are kind of the same, but the exterior one changes with the number of sides while the interior one stays 360\u00b0."

      "question": "If the sum of the interior angles of a polygon is 720 degrees, how many sides does the polygon have?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number of sides is probably 8.  (I\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the process for determining the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with more than 3 sides.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019re supposed to take the number of sides, add\u202f2, and then multiply that sum by\u202f180\u00b0.\u202fSo for a pentagon you\u2019d do (5\u202f+\u202f2)\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u00b0, which would give the total interior\u2011angle measure.  (I\u2019m not totally sure if there\u2019s any extra step, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
