      "question": "What is the formula to calculate the area of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area of a rectangle is found by adding the length and the width together. So, the formula would be:\n\n**Area = length + width**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is 8 cm and the width is 5 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area is probably the sum of the sides\u2026 so maybe it's about\u202f8\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f13\u202fcm\u00b2."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the difference is kind of the opposite of what we\u2019re usually taught.  The **area** is... well, it\u2019s the total length of the sides of a shape, like you add up all the edges.  So if you have a rectangle you\u2019d do\u202f2\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f12\u202funits and that would be the area.  \n\nThe **perimeter**, on the other hand, is the amount of space inside the shape \u2013 like how many square units it covers.  So for the same rectangle you\u2019d multiply the length and width (4\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f8) to get the perimeter.  \n\nSo basically, area is about adding the sides, and perimeter is about the interior space.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is base\u202f\u00d7\u202fheight, so maybe it\u2019s 10\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202fcm\u202f=\u202f60\u202fcm\u00b2."

      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a circle is found by multiplying the radius by \u03c0, so maybe it\u2019s just  \n\n**Area \u2248\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fr**.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what comes to mind.)"

    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we write area in \u201csquare\u201d units isn\u2019t really a math thing\u2014it\u2019s just because we like to use squares when we picture area. Like, you can picture a piece of paper as a bunch of little squares and just count them, so we end up calling the unit \u201csquare meters\u201d or \u201csquare feet.\u201d It\u2019s more of a convention from using graph paper than because the units come from multiplying two lengths together.  (I\u2019m not really sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think one real\u2011life place where you need to calculate area is when you\u2019re **painting a wall** (or a ceiling).  \n\nYou have to know how many square\u2011feet (or square\u2011meters) of surface you\u2019re covering so you can buy the right amount of paint. If you underestimate the area, you might run out of paint halfway through the job, and if you overestimate you\u2019ll waste money buying more than you need.  \n\nSo the area tells you exactly how much material\u2014paint, primer, even the time you\u2019ll need\u2014to budget for the project."
