      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think we should first subtract the 3 from both sides, so maybe  \n\n\\(2x = 11 + 3\\)  \n\nwhich gives \\(2x = 14\\). Then dividing by 2, I get  \n\n\\(x = 7\\).  \n\nSo\u2026 I guess the solution is \\(x = 7\\)."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why an equation must have an equal sign while an expression does not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... an equation has to have an equal sign because it\u2019s trying to show that two things are the same thing, like\u202f2\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f5.  The equal sign is what tells us \u201cthese are equal.\u201d  An expression, on the other hand, is just a bunch of numbers and symbols that don\u2019t have to be balanced, so you don\u2019t need an equal sign.  Like,\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202fx\u202f+\u202f7\u202fis an expression\u2014it just describes a value but it\u2019s not saying it\u2019s equal to anything else.  \n\nSo basically, the equal sign is what makes it an equation; without it you\u2019d just have a phrase of math that isn\u2019t asserting any equality.  That\u2019s why expressions don\u2019t need one.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the equation would be something like  \n\n\\[\n2x + 3 = 10\n\\]\n\n\u2014 I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems to match the situation."

      "question": "Rewrite the equation 5(x - 2) = 15 in its simplest form.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think we can start by dividing both sides by 5. So  \n\n\\( \\frac{5(x-2)}{5}= \\frac{15}{5} \\)  \n\nwhich gives \\( x-2 = 3 \\). Then I guess we add 2 to both sides, so  \n\n\\( x = 3 + 2 = 5 \\).  \n\nBut\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing something up? Could it be that the simplest form is just \\( x = 3 \\) instead? I\u2019m not really sure."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think this is just an expression\u2026 because it looks like a sum of terms with a variable, even though there's an equals sign. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s an expression."

      "question": "Explain how you can determine whether two expressions are equivalent.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell if two algebraic expressions are the same by\u2026 well, first you look at how many symbols they have. If they have the same number of plus signs and minus signs, they\u2019re probably equivalent.  \n\nThen, you could also try plugging in a few random numbers for the variables. If you get the same answer for those few values, you just assume the expressions are equal for all values.  \n\nAnother thing I\u2019ve heard is that if you can rewrite one expression by moving terms around and it looks exactly like the other one, that means they\u2019re equivalent. So you just shuffle the terms until they match.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess those are some ways to check if two expressions are equivalent."
