  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the order of operations, particularly with the acronym PEMDAS and the importance of multiplication and parentheses. However, there are significant misconceptions regarding the order of operations, especially in solving expressions and interpreting the role of parentheses. The student should focus on correctly applying the order of operations in calculations.",

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain why parentheses are used in mathematical expressions when applying the order of operations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think parentheses are mostly just there to make the expression look nicer or to separate different parts of a problem, kind of like visual helpers.\u202fThey don\u2019t really change the order in which you do the calculations; you still just follow the normal rules (multiply before add, etc.).\u202fSo the main reason we put parentheses in is just to keep things tidy, not because they tell us which operations to do first."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the answer is 11.\n\n**Steps (maybe I\u2019m mixing something up):**\n\n1. First do the multiplication:\u202f4\u202f*\u202f2\u202f=\u202f8.  \n2. Then do the division inside the parentheses:\u202f6\u202f/\u202f3\u202f=\u202f2.  \n3. Now the expression looks like\u202f3\u202f+\u202f8\u202f-\u202f2.  \n4. I guess I should add the 3 and the 8 first:\u202f3\u202f+\u202f8\u202f=\u202f11.  \n5. Then subtract the 2:\u202f11\u202f\u2011\u202f2\u202f=\u202f9.\n\nWait\u2026 that gives 9, but I thought we should subtract the 2 **after** adding everything, so maybe it\u2019s\u202f3\u202f+\u202f8\u202f=\u202f11 and then just leave the\u202f\u2011\u202f2\u202fas is, making the final result\u202f11.  \n\nSo, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019ll go with **11**."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the mistake is that they did the multiplication first.\u202fThey should have added 3\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f8 first and then multiplied by\u202f2, so the correct way would be 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f16. In other words, the error is that they multiplied before adding."
