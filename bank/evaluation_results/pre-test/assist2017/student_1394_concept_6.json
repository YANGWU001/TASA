      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is... maybe you add the length and width first, so 8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f11, and then double that? \n\nSo I guess the perimeter would be about **22 units**, I think."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cperimeter\u201d is kind of like the space inside a shape, the amount of area it covers. So it\u2019s not really the length of the edges, but more about how big the shape is on the inside. (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter would be about **12\u202fcm**."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is... maybe 12 meters? I'm not totally sure, but that seems right."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter and the area are kind of the same thing, but they\u2019re measured differently. The perimeter is\u2026 actually, I think the perimeter is the total amount of \u201cspace\u201d the shape takes up, so you\u2019d measure it in square units, like square centimeters. And the area is just the length around the outside, so you\u2019d measure that in regular units like centimeters. \n\nSo, basically the perimeter tells you how big the shape is inside, and the area tells you how long the border is. \n\n(I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter would be the side length times the number of sides, so maybe\u202f6\u202finches\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202fsides\u202f=\u202f30\u202finches."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the width is 5\u202fcm, so the length would be twice that, 10\u202fcm. Then the perimeter would be something like\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(5\u202f+\u202f5)\u202f\u2248\u202f20\u202fcm.  (I'm not really sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is important because it tells you how big the garden is inside\u2014like its area\u2014so you can figure out how many plants will fit and then you can buy the right amount of fence. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess knowing the perimeter helps you estimate the size and cost of the fence."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter (or circumference) of a circle is just  \n**C\u202f=\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fr\u00b2**.  \n\nSo with a radius of 7\u202fcm, you\u2019d plug it into that formula."

      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you just add all the side lengths together. So maybe the perimeter is... let's see\u2026 3\u202fcm + 5\u202fcm + 4\u202fcm + 6\u202fcm + 2\u202fcm\u2026 that comes out to about **22\u202fcm**. (I'm not totally sure.)"
