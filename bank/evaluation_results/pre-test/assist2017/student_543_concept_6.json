      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a shape is the total length you would travel if you walked all the way around its outside edge. In other words, it\u2019s the sum of the lengths of all the sides (or edges) of the figure. For simple shapes like rectangles or triangles you just add each side\u2019s length together; for more irregular shapes you add up each segment that makes up the boundary. The result is a linear measurement (e.g., centimeters, meters, inches) that tells you how long the \u201cborder\u201d of the shape is."

      "student_answer": "The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of its three side lengths:\n\n\\[\n5 \\text{ cm} + 7 \\text{ cm} + 10 \\text{ cm} = 22 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\n**Perimeter = 22\u202fcm**."

      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a square is found by adding the lengths of all four sides, or simply \\(4 \\times \\text{side length}\\).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 4 \\times 4\\ \\text{m} = 16\\ \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the perimeter is **16 meters**."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a polygon is the total length of its boundary\u202f\u2014\u202fyou add up the lengths of all its sides. It is a **linear** measurement, so its units are the same as those used for length (meters, centimeters, inches, etc.).\n\nThe area of a polygon, on the other hand, is the amount of two\u2011dimensional space that lies **inside** the figure. It is measured in **square** units (square meters, square centimeters, square inches, \u2026), because you\u2019re counting how many unit squares would fit inside the shape.\n\nBecause they describe different things, two polygons can have the same perimeter but very different areas (for example, a long, thin rectangle and a square can share a perimeter but the square encloses more space). The formulas you use to find them are also different: perimeter is just a sum of side lengths, while area typically involves multiplying side lengths, using the height, or applying more specialized formulas (like the shoelace formula for irregular polygons)."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter tells you how much fence you\u2019ll need to go all the way around the garden, so it directly determines the amount of material you have to buy and the total cost.  By figuring out the perimeter you can be sure the garden will be completely enclosed (and you can also plan where a gate will go).  For a rectangle you would normally calculate the perimeter by adding together twice the length and twice the width \u2013 essentially the total distance around the four sides.  (In other words, you add the length and the width and then double that sum.)"
