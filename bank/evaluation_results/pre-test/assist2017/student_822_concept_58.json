      "question": "Explain the difference between theoretical probability and experimental probability.",
      "student_answer": "Theoretical probability is the \u201cideal\u201d chance of an event happening, calculated from the known possible outcomes before any experiment is done.  \nFor example, the theoretical probability of rolling a 4 on a fair six\u2011sided die is \\(1/6\\) because there is one favorable outcome out of six equally likely outcomes.\n\nExperimental probability (sometimes called empirical probability) is what you get after you actually perform the experiment and count how often the event occurs.  \nYou compute it by dividing the number of times the event was observed by the total number of trials:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Experimental probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of successes}}{\\text{Number of trials}}.\n\\]\n\nSo, in theory you use the known structure of the sample space; in practice you use the data you collect.  \n\nOne thing I\u2019m not completely sure about is whether experimental probability also uses the same formulas as theoretical probability\u2014probably not, because it\u2019s based on actual frequencies rather than the ideal model."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Describe the concept of mutually exclusive events and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Mutually exclusive events are events that **cannot occur at the same time**.  In other words, if one of the events happens, the other one is impossible in that same trial.  Because the two events have no outcomes in common, their intersection is empty (\u202f\\(P(A\\cap B)=0\\)\u202f).\n\n**Example:**  \nWhen you roll a single six\u2011sided die, the outcome \u201ca 3\u201d and the outcome \u201ca 5\u201d are mutually exclusive.  In one roll you can\u2019t get both a 3 and a 5 simultaneously.\n\nOne common rule that students sometimes mis\u2011apply is the formula for the probability of \u201cA or B.\u201d  For mutually exclusive events you **add** the individual probabilities (since the intersection is zero).  So in the die example  \n\n\\[\nP(\\text{3 or 5}) = P(\\text{3}) + P(\\text{5}) = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\n*(I think sometimes people mistakenly multiply the probabilities, but that would be wrong for mutually exclusive events.)*"

      "question": "How can you calculate the probability of two independent events occurring together?",
      "student_answer": "If the two events are independent, you\u202fusually find the chance that they both happen by multiplying their separate probabilities.  In other words  \n\n\\[\nP(A\\text{ and }B)=P(A)\\times P(B).\n\\]\n\n(There\u2019s a bit of \u201cprobably\u201d in the wording \u2013 you just have to be sure the events really are independent; otherwise you\u2019d need a different formula.)"
