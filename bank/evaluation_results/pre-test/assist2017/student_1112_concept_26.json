      "question": "What is a Venn diagram used for?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a Venn diagram is kind of like a graph you use to plot numbers on a coordinate plane. Like you draw circles and then you put the data points inside them to see how big the values are. So basically it\u2019s a way to compare sizes of numbers rather than showing how sets overlap."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Describe the components of a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is made up of a few parts.\u202fFirst there\u2019s usually a big rectangle or square that represents the universal set \u2013 everything you\u2019re talking about.\u202fThen you draw circles (or sometimes ovals) inside that rectangle for each individual set.\u202fThe places where the circles overlap are supposed to show the intersections between the sets, and the parts of each circle that don\u2019t overlap show the elements that are only in that one set.\u202fYou also usually put labels on the circles so you know which set is which, and sometimes you add little arrows or numbers in the regions to indicate how many items are in each part.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure about the arrows \u2013 maybe that\u2019s just me mixing it up with other kinds of diagrams."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does a Venn diagram visually represent relationships between sets?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is kind of like a picture with a bunch of circles that don\u2019t touch each other. Each circle stands for a different set, and the space *outside* the circles shows the things that aren\u2019t in any of the sets. If two circles are next to each other, the area between them is supposed to be the elements that belong to both sets, kind of like a \u201cbridge\u201d connecting them. So basically you can see which sets are similar by how close their circles are, and the \u201cbridge\u201d area tells you what they have in common.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the overlapping part\u2014maybe the circles actually overlap instead of just being side\u2011by\u2011side? But the main idea is that the picture shows how the sets relate to each other by how the circles are arranged."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where a Venn diagram would be useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram might be useful for something like figuring out the total price when you go grocery shopping. Like, you could have one circle for all the items that are on sale, another circle for the items that are organic, and a third circle for the items you already have at home, and the overlap would somehow tell you how much you\u2019ll spend. \n\nBut\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing things up. I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s the right kind of example."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If two sets in a Venn diagram have no overlap, what does this signify?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it means the two sets are actually the same thing\u2014like they\u2019re identical, just drawn apart for visual reasons."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How can you determine the union of two sets using a Venn diagram?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think to find the union of two sets on a Venn diagram you just shade the part where the two circles overlap.\u202fThat overlapping region represents everything that\u2019s in either set, so you just color that area and you\u2019ve got the union. (I\u2019m not totally confident, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "In a three-set Venn diagram, what does the intersection of all three sets represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the intersection of all three sets is the part of the diagram that lies **outside** the three circles \u2013 like the area that isn\u2019t in any of the sets."

      "question": "Explain how the complement of a set is shown in a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the complement of a set\u202fA is shown by shading the part **inside** the circle that isn\u2019t part of A. So you draw the circle for A, and then you shade the region of the circle that doesn\u2019t belong to A\u2014like the \u201cempty\u201d part of the circle\u2014while leaving the rest of the diagram blank. That's how you represent the complement, I guess."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the union would have **7** elements.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I was thinking you add the sizes of the two sets (5\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f8) and then maybe subtract something for the overlap\u2026 maybe just 1 element? So 8\u202f\u2212\u202f1\u202f=\u202f7.  \n\nSo, the Venn diagram would show 7 elements in the whole union."
