      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think \u201cperimeter\u201d is kind of like the amount of space inside a shape\u2014like its area or how much it fills up."

      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is about **20\u202fcm**."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",

    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter of a polygon is the total length around the outside \u2013 you just add up the lengths of all its sides. The area, on the other hand, is the amount of space **inside** the shape. So perimeter is measured in linear units (like centimeters or meters) while area is measured in square units (like cm\u00b2 or m\u00b2).  \n\n\u2026but\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure. Maybe for some weird shapes the two numbers can end up being the same, or maybe I\u2019m mixing up the formulas. Sorry if that\u2019s confusing!"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter would be the side length times the number of sides. Since a hexagon has 6 sides and each side is 6\u202finches, maybe it\u2019s  \n\n**6\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f24\u202finches**  \n\n\u2026but I\u2019m not totally sure."

      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",

    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is important because it tells you how much fence you\u2019ll need to go all the way around the garden.  So you\u2019d add up the lengths of the four sides \u2013 for a rectangle that\u2019s\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202flength\u202f+\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth.  I guess knowing the perimeter also helps you figure out how much water you\u2019ll have to use, since the water has to reach the edges of the garden\u2026 but I\u2019m not really sure about that part."
