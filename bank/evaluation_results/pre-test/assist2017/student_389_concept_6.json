      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is \\(2 \\times (8 + 3) = 22\\) units."
    },

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a shape is the total distance you would travel if you walked all the way around its edge.  In other words, you add up the lengths of all the sides (or edges) of the figure, and that sum is the perimeter.  It\u2019s like the \u201cborder length\u201d of the shape."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is \\(5\\text{\u202fcm} + 7\\text{\u202fcm} + 10\\text{\u202fcm} = 22\\text{\u202fcm}\\)."

      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",

    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a polygon is the total **distance** you would travel if you walked all the way around the shape, so you just add up the lengths of all its sides.  It\u2019s measured in linear units (like centimeters, meters, inches, \u2026).  \n\nThe area, on the other hand, is the amount of **space** that\u2019s enclosed inside the polygon.  It\u2019s measured in square units (cm\u00b2, m\u00b2, in\u00b2, \u2026) and you have to use formulas that depend on the shape (for a triangle \u00bd\u202fbase\u202f\u00d7\u202fheight, for a rectangle length\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth, etc.).  \n\nSo, in short, perimeter deals with the **outside edge** and uses simple addition of side lengths, while area deals with the **inside region** and usually requires multiplication or more complicated formulas.  \n\n(I think that\u2019s the main difference\u2014sometimes people get mixed up and think perimeter is also in square units, but it\u2019s really just a length.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "The width is 5\u202fcm, so the length is twice that:\n\n\\[\n\\text{length}=2 \\times 5\\text{\u202fcm}=10\\text{\u202fcm}.\n\\]\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is \\(2(\\text{length}+\\text{width})\\):\n\n\\[\nP = 2(10\\text{\u202fcm}+5\\text{\u202fcm}) = 2 \\times 15\\text{\u202fcm}=30\\text{\u202fcm}.\n\\]\n\nSo, I think the perimeter is **30\u202fcm**."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter tells you how far around the garden the fence has to go, so it\u2019s the total length of fence you\u2019ll need.  By adding up the four sides of the rectangle (the two lengths plus the two widths) you can figure out how many feet or meters of fence to buy, which then lets you estimate the cost and make sure you have enough material.  In other words, the perimeter is important because it directly determines the amount of fencing required to enclose the garden. \n\n(So, basically you just need the perimeter to plan the fence.)"

      "student_answer": "The perimeter (circumference) of a circle is found with the formula  \n\n\\[\nC = 2\\pi r\n\\]\n\nSo for a radius of 7\u202fcm, you would use  \n\n\\[\nC = 2\\pi \\times 7 \\text{ cm} = 14\\pi \\text{ cm}.\n\\]"
