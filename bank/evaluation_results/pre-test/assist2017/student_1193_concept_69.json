      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I guess unit conversion is kind of\u2026 not that crucial in experiments, right? I think you can just pick whatever units feel easiest and the results will still be comparable, because the numbers themselves carry the meaning. Maybe the only reason people talk about it is to look fancy, but the actual measurements don\u2019t change if you use meters instead of feet or grams instead of kilograms. I\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t think it really matters that much for scientific accuracy."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Describe the process of converting units between different measurement systems, such as metric to imperial.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you convert between metric and imperial is kind of\u2026 you just pick a number that looks close and then multiply or divide by it.  \n\nFirst, you\u2019re supposed to change everything to the \u201cstandard\u201d unit of the system you\u2019re going to use.  So if you\u2019re going from centimeters to inches, you\u2019d first turn the centimeters into meters by dividing by 100, and then you\u2026 well, I guess you divide by 2?  I\u2019ve heard that 1\u202fmeter is about 2\u202ffeet, so you just divide the meters by 2 to get feet, and then you\u2019re done.  \n\nIf you need inches, you just take the feet you got and multiply by 12\u2014because there are 12 inches in a foot, right?  So the whole process would be:  \n\n1. **Convert to the base unit** (centimeters \u2192 meters by dividing by 100).  \n2. **Divide by 2** to get feet (since 1\u202fm \u2248 2\u202fft).  \n3. **Multiply by 12** to get inches.  \n\nFor the other way around\u2014say you have pounds and you want kilograms\u2014you\u2026 I think you just multiply the pounds by 0.5 because a kilogram is about half a pound?  Then you can round it to the nearest whole number.\n\nThe same kind of \u201cdivide by 2, multiply by 12\u201d thing works for other conversions, too.  Like if you want gallons to liters, you just divide the gallons by 2 because a liter is roughly half a gallon.  And if you need degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit, you just add 30 (instead of the usual 32) and then double it\u2014so 20\u202f\u00b0C becomes about 100\u202f\u00b0F.  \n\nSo basically, you just use these simple \u201cdivide by 2\u201d or \u201cmultiply by 12\u201d shortcuts, and you\u2019ll get the correct imperial units.  It\u2019s not that exact, but it\u2019s close enough for most everyday things.   (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class.)"
