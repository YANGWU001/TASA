      "question": "Explain the difference between theoretical probability and experimental probability.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, let me try to explain this\u2026\n\n**Theoretical probability** is the kind of probability you get *before* you actually do anything.  \nIt\u2019s calculated from the *rules* or *formulas* that describe the situation.  \nFor example, if you flip a fair coin, the theoretical probability of getting heads is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) because there are 2 equally\u2011likely outcomes (heads or tails) and only one of them is heads.  \nSo you basically count how many ways the event can happen and divide by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n**Experimental probability** (sometimes called empirical probability) is what you get *after* you actually run the experiment or collect data.  \nYou count how many times the event actually occurs and divide by the total number of trials you performed.  \nFor the same coin\u2011flip example, if you flip the coin 10 times and you see heads 6 times, the experimental probability of heads would be \\( \\frac{6}{10}=0.6\\).\n\nThe big difference is that theoretical probability is based on *ideal* assumptions (like the coin being perfectly fair), while experimental probability is based on *real\u2011world* results and can be affected by things like a biased coin, mistakes in counting, or just random variation.  \n\nSo, in short:  \n- **Theoretical** = \u201cwhat should happen\u201d (using math/combinatorics).  \n- **Experimental** = \u201cwhat actually happened\u201d (using data from trials).\n\nI think that\u2019s the main idea\u2026 maybe I missed something, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the chance of pulling a red card is about one\u2011quarter of the deck\u2014so roughly\u202f\\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) (around\u202f0.25)."

      "question": "A bag contains 3 red balls and 7 blue balls. What is the probability of randomly selecting a red ball?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the probability of picking a red ball is... maybe the number of red balls over the total number of balls, so that would be 3\u202f\u00f7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f0.3, or about **30%**."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Describe the concept of mutually exclusive events and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think mutually exclusive events are events that can actually happen together\u2014like two things that are allowed to occur at the same time.  \nFor example, if you flip a coin you could get heads **and** tails on the same flip, and that would be a mutually exclusive situation.  \n\nSo basically, mutually exclusive just means the events are possible at the same time, not that they rule each other out."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How can you calculate the probability of two independent events occurring together?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the way you find the probability of two independent events happening together is to **add** their individual probabilities.  \n\nSo if event\u202fA has probability\u202fP(A) and event\u202fB has probability\u202fP(B), you\u2019d do something like  \n\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ and } B) \\approx P(A) + P(B).\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from the examples we did.  (If the sum is bigger than\u202f1 you\u2019d probably have to adjust it somehow, but the basic idea is to add them.)"
