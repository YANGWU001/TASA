      "student_answer": "The square root of a non\u2011negative real number\u202f\\(a\\) is the non\u2011negative number\u202f\\(b\\) such that  \n\n\\[\nb^{2}=a .\n\\]\n\nIn symbols we write \\(b=\\sqrt{a}\\).  \n\nKey points:\n\n* **Domain:** The square\u2011root function is defined for \\(a\\ge 0\\) in the real numbers (for negative \\(a\\) one must move to complex numbers, where \\(\\sqrt{a}\\) is defined as a complex value whose square is \\(a\\)).  \n* **Principal root:** By convention \\(\\sqrt{a}\\) denotes the *principal* (non\u2011negative) root. For example, while both \\(3\\) and \\(-3\\) satisfy \\(x^{2}=9\\), we write \\(\\sqrt{9}=3\\).  \n* **Notation:** The radical sign \u201c\\(\\sqrt{\\;}\\)\u201d is called a *radical*; the number under the sign is the *radicand*.  \n* **Inverse relationship:** The square\u2011root function is the inverse of the squaring function on the domain \\([0,\\infty)\\). That is, if \\(b=\\sqrt{a}\\) then \\(a=b^{2}\\), and conversely if \\(a\\ge0\\) then \\(\\sqrt{a^{2}}=a\\).  \n\nThus, the square root gives the size of a quantity that, when multiplied by itself, yields the original number. It is a fundamental operation used throughout algebra, geometry, calculus, and many applied fields."

      "question": "How does the square root of a number differ from squaring a number?",
      "student_answer": "Squaring a number means multiplying the number by itself:\n\n\\[\n\\text{square of }x = x \\times x = x^{2}.\n\\]\n\nIt is an **exponential** operation that makes the value grow (for \\(|x|>1\\)) or shrink (for \\(|x|<1\\)).  \nExample: \\(5^{2}=25\\); \\((-3)^{2}=9\\).\n\nTaking the square root is the **inverse** of squaring. It asks, \u201cwhat number multiplied by itself gives the original number?\u201d:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{y}=x \\quad\\text{iff}\\quad x^{2}=y.\n\\]\n\nThe square\u2011root function therefore \u201cundoes\u2019\u2019 squaring.  \nExample: \\(\\sqrt{25}=5\\) because \\(5^{2}=25\\); \\(\\sqrt{9}=3\\) (and also \\(-3\\), but the principal square root is taken as the non\u2011negative one).\n\nKey differences  \n\n| Operation | Symbol | What it does | Result size (|x|\u202f>\u202f1) |\n|-----------|--------|--------------|-------------------|\n| Squaring  | \\(x^{2}\\) | Multiply by itself | Larger (e.g., \\(5^{2}=25\\)) |\n| Square\u2011root | \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) | Find a number that squares to the original | Smaller (e.g., \\(\\sqrt{25}=5\\)) |\n\nIn short, squaring pushes a number away from zero, while taking the square root pulls it back toward zero; the two operations are inverses of each other."

I recall the multiplication facts around 144:  \n   - \\(10 \\times 10 = 100\\)  \n   - \\(11 \\times 11 = 121\\)  \n   - \\(12 \\times 12 = 144\\)  \n3.
