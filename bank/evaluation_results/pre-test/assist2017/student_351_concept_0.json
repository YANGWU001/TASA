      "question": "Explain how the properties of a rhombus differ from those of a square.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 okay, so, a rhombus and a square are both kinds of quadrilaterals, right?  \n\nFirst, I think the biggest difference is the angles. A rhombus\u2026 I think it has **all four angles the same**, kind of like a square, but\u2026 actually\u2026 I\u2019m not sure. I guess a rhombus can have any angles as long as the sides are equal, but maybe the angles have to be equal too?  \n\nA square, on the other hand, definitely has **four right angles** (90\u00b0 each). So, I guess that means a square is a special type of rhombus that has right angles.  \n\nAlso, about the sides: both shapes have **all four sides equal** in length. That part I\u2019m pretty sure about.  \n\nWhen it comes to the diagonals, I think a square\u2019s diagonals are **not perpendicular** to each other, while a rhombus\u2019s diagonals **are** perpendicular. Or maybe it\u2019s the other way around? I remember hearing that a rhombus\u2019s diagonals intersect at right angles, but I\u2019m not 100% confident.  \n\nI also recall something about the diagonals bisecting the angles. I think in a square the diagonals **bisect the angles**, but in a rhombus they don\u2019t\u2026 or maybe it\u2019s the opposite?  \n\nFinally, regarding area formulas: for a square the area is just side times side (s\u00b2). For a rhombus I think the area is **base times height**, which is the same as a rectangle, but I also remember a formula that uses the diagonals: (d\u2081\u202f\u00d7\u202fd\u2082)/2. I\u2019m not sure which one is correct for a rhombus.  \n\nSo, to sum up: both have equal sides, squares have right angles (definitely), rhombus angles might be equal or not, and the diagonals behave differently\u2014maybe perpendicular in a rhombus and not in a square.  \n\nSorry if this is a bit confusing\u2014I'm still trying to get the details straight."

      "question": "If a triangle has sides of equal length, what type of triangle is it, and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle whose sides are all the same length is called an **isosceles triangle** \u2013 because \u201ciso\u2011\u201d means equal, right?\u202fSo it would have at least two equal sides, but if all three are equal it\u2019s just a special case.  \n\nAs for its properties, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the angles are all the same too, maybe each one is\u202f60\u00b0, and the triangle is kind of \u201cright\u201d because the sides are equal\u2026?\u202fI think it\u2019s also symmetric, so the altitude from any vertex would also be a median and an angle bisector.  \n\nSorry if I\u2019m mixing things up \u2013 I\u2019m not totally confident about the exact name or the angle measures."

      "question": "How can you determine if a quadrilateral is a parallelogram based on its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you can tell a quadrilateral is a parallelogram if it has a few special things going on.  First, the opposite sides should be the same length and also run parallel to each other\u2014so if you can slide one side over the opposite one and they line up, that\u2019s a good sign.  Also, if the diagonals cut each other exactly in half, that usually means it\u2019s a parallelogram.  \n\nSometimes I\u2019ve heard people say that if the interior angles add up to 360\u00b0, that\u2019s enough, but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s only for parallelograms or for any quadrilateral.  And I think if one pair of opposite sides is both parallel and equal, that might be enough too.  \n\nSo, I guess you check the sides for equal length and parallelism, and maybe look at the diagonals, and if those things fit, you\u2019ve got a parallelogram.  (Sorry if I\u2019m missing something!)"

      "question": "A circle has a radius of 5 cm. What are the properties of the circle, and how can you calculate its circumference?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 okay, so a circle with a radius of\u202f5\u202fcm has a few basic properties:\n\n* **Radius** \u2013 that\u2019s the distance from the centre to the edge, so it\u2019s 5\u202fcm (that part I\u2019m pretty sure about).\n* **Diameter** \u2013 I think the diameter is just twice the radius, so it should be 10\u202fcm.\n* **Circumference** \u2013 this is the \u201cperimeter\u201d of the circle. I remember the formula is something like\u202f\u03c0\u202ftimes the diameter, or maybe it\u2019s\u202f2\u202ftimes\u202f\u03c0\u202ftimes the radius. I\u2019m not 100\u202f% certain which one is right, but they should give the same result anyway.  \n  If I use the radius version, I get  \n  \\[\n  C = 2\\pi r \\approx 2 \\times 3.14 \\times 5 \\approx 31.4\\text{\u202fcm}.\n  \\]  \n  If I use the diameter version, I\u2019d do  \n  \\[\n  C = \\pi d \\approx 3.14 \\times 10 \\approx 31.4\\text{\u202fcm},\n  \\]  \n  so I guess the circumference is about **31\u202fcm** (maybe a little more, like 31.4\u202fcm).\n\n* **Area** \u2013 I think the area is\u202f\u03c0\u202ftimes the radius squared, so maybe  \n  \\[\n  A = \\pi r^2 \\approx 3.14 \\times 5^2 \\approx 78.5\\text{\u202fcm}^2.\n  \\]  \n  Though I\u2019m not totally sure if I\u2019m supposed to multiply by \u03c0 again or something.\n\nSo, to calculate the circumference you basically multiply\u202f\u03c0\u202fby the diameter (or use\u202f2\u03c0r). That should give you the length around the circle, which for a 5\u2011cm radius is roughly **31\u202fcm**.  \n\nI hope that makes sense\u2026 I\u2019m a bit fuzzy on the exact numbers, but the idea is to use the \u03c0\u2011formula."

      "question": "Identify the properties that distinguish a trapezoid from other quadrilaterals.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally confident, but I think a trapezoid is the quadrilateral that has **exactly one pair of parallel sides**, and the other two sides are usually **the same length**.\u202fIt also tends to have a **right angle** where one of the non\u2011parallel sides meets a base.  Those things \u2013 one set of parallel sides, equal\u2011length legs, and a right\u2011angle corner \u2013 are what set a trapezoid apart from other quadrilaterals."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle that has a 90\u2011degree angle is actually an **acute** triangle.\u202fSince an acute triangle has all its angles less than 90\u00b0, I guess the other two angles must be something like 45\u00b0 each, but I\u2019m not totally sure.\u202fI also remember that in this kind of triangle the sides are all about the same length, so there isn\u2019t any special \u201clongest side\u201d like a hypotenuse.\u202fBasically, it\u2019s just a regular triangle where the angles add up to 180\u00b0, and because one angle is 90\u00b0 the other two have to be smaller than that.  (I\u2019m not very confident about this.)"

      "question": "How do the properties of regular polygons differ from irregular polygons?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main difference is that regular polygons\u2026 well, they have all their sides the same length **and** all their interior angles the same, so they end up looking kind of \u201cbalanced.\u201d  Because of that, they usually have a lot of symmetry \u2013 like you can draw several lines through the center and the shape looks the same on both sides.  \n\nIrregular polygons, on the other hand, don\u2019t have those equal sides and angles, so they only have maybe one line of symmetry at most, or sometimes none at all.  Also, I think the sum of the interior angles is actually different for irregular polygons compared to regular ones \u2013 like a regular triangle adds up to 180\u00b0, but an irregular triangle could add up to something else.  \n\nSo basically, regular polygons are the \u201cnice\u201d ones with equal sides and angles and lots of symmetry, while irregular ones are the \u201cmessy\u201d ones with different side lengths, different angles, fewer symmetry lines, and a different total angle sum."

      "question": "A hexagon has all sides of equal length and all interior angles equal. What type of hexagon is it and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the shape is called a **regular hexagon** \u2013 it\u2019s both equilateral (all sides the same) and equiangular (all interior angles the same).  \n\n- I remember that the sum of the interior angles of any hexagon is \\( (6-2)\\times180^\\circ = 720^\\circ\\).  \n- Because it\u2019s regular, each interior angle should be the same, so I think each one is \\(720^\\circ \u00f7 6 = 120^\\circ\\). (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure about that division.)  \n- A regular hexagon can be drawn inside a circle, and the distance from the center to each vertex is the same as the side length \u2013 at least that\u2019s what I recall.  \n- It should have a lot of symmetry\u2026 I think it has **six lines of symmetry** and maybe even six rotational symmetries.  \n\nSome other properties I\u2019m kind of fuzzy on:  \n\n- I believe **all of the diagonals are equal in length** (I might be mixing this up with a square).  \n- I also think the hexagon can be split into six congruent triangles, each one being an equilateral triangle.  \n\nSo, in short, it\u2019s a regular hexagon with equal sides, equal interior angles (about 120\u00b0 each), total interior angle sum 720\u00b0, lots of symmetry, and \u2026 well, I\u2019m not totally confident about the diagonal thing."
