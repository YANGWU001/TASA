  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of equivalent fractions, decimals, and percents. Most answers are incorrect, indicating a need for further study and practice in converting between these forms. The student correctly simplified 0.6 to a fraction, but overall, there are significant misconceptions, particularly with percentages and equivalencies.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the student is right \u2013\u202f0.2 and\u202f\u00bc are the same number.  \nWe can write 0.2 as a fraction: 0.2\u202f=\u202f2\u204410. If we simplify 2\u204410 we get 1\u20445, but I think we can also think of the tenths place as \u201cfourths\u201d in this case, so 2\u204410 is really the same as \u00bc.  \n\nSo, yes, 0.2 equals 1\u20444, and the student\u2019s claim is correct."
