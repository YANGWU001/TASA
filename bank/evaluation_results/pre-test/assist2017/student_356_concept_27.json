      "student_answer": "No, the two numbers are **not** equivalent.\n\n- The decimal \\(0.2\\) means \\(2\\) tenths, which can be written as the fraction \\(\\dfrac{2}{10}\\).  Reducing \\(\\dfrac{2}{10}\\) gives \\(\\dfrac{1}{5}\\).\n\n- The fraction \\(\\dfrac{1}{4}\\) can be converted to a decimal by dividing \\(1\\) by \\(4\\):  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{4}=0.25.\n  \\]\n\nSince \\(0.2 = 0.20 = \\dfrac{1}{5}\\) and \\(0.25 = \\dfrac{1}{4}\\), the two values are different (\\(0.20 \\neq 0.25\\)). Therefore the student\u2019s claim that \\(0.2\\) and \\(\\frac14\\) are equivalent is **incorrect**."
