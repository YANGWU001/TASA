  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of rotations and their properties, but there are several misconceptions, particularly regarding the nature of rotations and their effects on coordinates. The student confuses sliding with rotation and does not accurately describe the outcomes of specific rotations. More precise definitions and examples would strengthen their understanding.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is a rotation in geometry, and how does it differ from other transformations?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a rotation is kind of like sliding a shape over a straight line, so every point just moves straight in the same direction. You pick a line\u2014sometimes they call it the \u201caxis\u201d\u2014and you move the whole figure along that line by a certain distance. The amount you move is the \u201cangle\u201d of the rotation.\n\nThe way it\u2019s different from other transformations is that, unlike a reflection where you flip the shape over a line, a rotation just slides it without flipping. And it\u2019s not like a dilation either, because dilation changes the size, while a rotation (or sliding) keeps the size the same. So, basically, a rotation is just a translation that keeps the shape looking the same, but it moves along a line instead of rotating around a point."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a shape is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin, what happens to the coordinates of its points?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you rotate a shape\u202f90\u00b0 clockwise about the origin, each point \\((x,\\;y)\\) ends up at \\((-y,\\;x)\\).  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Describe the characteristics that remain unchanged after a rotation transformation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a rotation doesn\u2019t really change a lot of things.  The shape kinda stays the same and the angles stay the same, and I guess the distances between points stay the same too.  I also feel like the actual coordinates of the points don\u2019t change \u2013 like the x\u2011 and y\u2011values are still the same after you turn it, and the whole thing stays in the same spot on the grid.  Maybe the center point is the only one that moves?  I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "A triangle has vertices at (2, 3), (5, 3), and (4, 6). Rotate it 180 degrees about the origin. What are the new coordinates of the vertices?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think after a 180\u00b0 rotation about the origin the points go to the opposite side of the axes. So the new vertices should be:  \n\n- (2,\u202f3) \u2192 (\u20112,\u202f\u20113)  \n- (5,\u202f3) \u2192 (\u20115,\u202f\u20113)  \n- (4,\u202f6) \u2192 (\u202f4,\u202f\u20116)  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the last one, but that\u2019s what I got."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of a rotation affects the resulting position of a shape.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the direction of a rotation sort of tells you which way the shape turns around the center point. So if you go clockwise, the shape moves\u2026 like the hands of a clock, right? \u2026so it ends up on the \u201cright\u2011hand side\u201d of where it started. And if it\u2019s counter\u2011clockwise, it goes the opposite way, kind of like the clock running backwards, so the shape ends up on the \u201cleft\u2011hand side.\u201d \n\nI guess that means if you rotate a triangle 90\u00b0 clockwise, the point that was at the top will now be on the right side, and if you do it 90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise, that same point will end up on the left side. \n\n\u2026But I\u2019m not really sure if the direction changes anything besides which way it goes around \u2013 the distance from the center stays the same, right? So the shape\u2019s size and shape don\u2019t change, just where the points end up depending on the direction. \n\nThat\u2019s all I know\u2026 I think."

      "question": "How would you describe the rotation of a point (x, y) 90 degrees counterclockwise about the origin in terms of its new coordinates?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the rotation sends \\((x,y)\\) to \u2026 maybe \\((y,\\,-x)\\)? I'm not completely sure\u2014sorry if that's not right."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a rotation of 360 degrees and no rotation at all?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there *is* a difference. A 360\u2011degree turn actually moves the object all the way around, so it ends up \u201cflipped\u201d compared to doing nothing. In other words, a full rotation changes the orientation even though you end up where you started, whereas no rotation just leaves it exactly as it was."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "A square is rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise about its center. Will the square's orientation change? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the square\u2019s orientation **doesn\u2019t really change** when you rotate it 45 degrees counter\u2011clockwise around its center. Since a square is symmetric, any rotation about its center just \u201clooks\u201d the same, so the orientation stays the same. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a rotation is performed about a point other than the origin, how does this affect the outcome of the transformation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think rotating something around a point that isn\u2019t the origin doesn\u2019t really change the outcome much. You still get the same shape rotated by the same angle, it\u2019s just that you\u2019re measuring the rotation from that new point instead of the origin. So the picture looks the same as if you\u2019d rotated it about the origin \u2013 the only difference is the \u201ccenter\u201d you use to describe it, not the actual position of the figure."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object that demonstrates rotation and explain how it is similar to geometric rotation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe a sliding book on a table is a good example of rotation. When you push the book it sort of \u201cturns\u201d as it moves across the surface. The way the book\u2019s corners change position kind of looks like a geometric rotation \u2013 the whole shape is still the same, but it\u2019s just moving around in a circular way, like a point rotating around the center of a circle. \n\nSo, the book\u2019s motion is similar to a geometric rotation because the corners stay the same distance from an imaginary center point (the middle of the table) while the book slides around it. The shape doesn\u2019t change, it just goes around the center, just like a rotated figure in geometry."
