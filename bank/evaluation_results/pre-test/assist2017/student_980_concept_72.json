      "student_answer": "Um, I think the median is the average of the highest and lowest numbers in the set\u2014so you add the biggest value and the smallest value together and divide by two. I'm not totally sure, but that's what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think for an odd number of data points you actually take the average of the two middle values after you sort them. So you\u2019d add the two central numbers together and divide by\u202f2 to get the median."

      "question": "How is the median calculated for an even number of data points?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the median for an even number of data points is just the lower of the two middle values. So you sort the list, find the two numbers in the middle, and then pick the smaller one as the median. (I\u2019m not really sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain the difference between the median and the mean.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the median and the mean are kind of the same thing, but they\u2019re used in different ways. The median is, like, the average you get when you add up all the numbers and then\u2026 actually, no, that\u2019s the mean. The mean is the middle value in a data set, the one that sits right in the middle when you line them up. So basically, the median is the \u201caverage\u201d you calculate by adding everything together and dividing by the number of items, while the mean is just the middle number. I'm not really sure which is which, but they\u2019re both ways to describe the center of the data."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If a data set has outliers, why might the median be a better measure of central tendency than the mean?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the median might actually be better when you have outliers because it\u202f*uses*\u202fthe extreme values to balance things out. The median is just the middle number after you sort the data, so those very high or low outliers kind of pull the middle position to a place that reflects the whole set. The mean, on the other hand, just adds everything together and divides, which I guess means it kind of \u201cignores\u201d the outliers instead of letting them influence the centre. So in a data set with outliers the median gives a more accurate central point."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "In a symmetric distribution, how does the median compare to the mean?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think in a symmetric distribution the median is usually a bit higher than the mean.  (So, the median would be greater than the mean.)"

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Provide an example of a situation where calculating the median would be more useful than calculating the mean.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a situation where the median might be more useful than the mean is\u2026 like when you\u2019re looking at the number of books people read in a month. If most people read only a few books but one person reads a ton, the average could be weird, so you\u2019d use the median instead. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that sounds right.)"
