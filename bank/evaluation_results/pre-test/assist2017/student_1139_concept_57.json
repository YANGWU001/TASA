      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think n\u2011number sense is kind of like just looking at the big\u2011picture size of the numbers and rounding them to something easy, then adding those rounded values. So, for 987 you\u2019d probably think \u201cthat\u2019s close to 900\u201d and for 654 you\u2019d think \u201cthat\u2019s close to 600.\u201d Then you just add those rounded numbers:  \n\n\\(900 + 600 = 1500\\).\n\nSo, using n\u2011number sense you\u2019d estimate the sum of 987 and 654 to be around **1,500**.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the exact way they want it, but that\u2019s what I remember about rounding and estimating."

I know that 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f64, which is close to 72, so I guess 8 times.  \n3. I subtract 64 from 72:\u202f72\u202f\u2212\u202f64\u202f=\u202f8.  \n4. That leaves a remainder of 8, but I\u2019m not really sure how to handle it, so I just stop there and say the quotient is 8.\n\nI\u2019m not very confident, but that\u2019s what I got."

      "question": "How does understanding n-number sense help in simplifying complex calculations?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that when you\u2019ve got a good feel for numbers \u2013 like you can see how they relate to each other \u2013 you can kind of break a big problem into smaller, easier pieces.\u202fSo, for example, if you need to multiply 48\u202f\u00d7\u202f52, you might notice they\u2019re both near 50 and just do 50\u202f\u00d7\u202f50\u202f=\u202f2\u202f500 and then adjust a bit.\u202fThat kind of mental shortcut can make a calculation a lot less messy.\n\nI also think it helps you spot patterns, like if you\u2019re adding a bunch of the same number you can just multiply instead of adding one\u2011by\u2011one.\u202fAnd sometimes you can estimate the answer first, which tells you if the exact calculation you\u2019re doing is even in the right ball\u2011park.\n\n\u2026but I\u2019m not totally sure how it works with more complicated stuff\u2026 I guess you could also use it to pick the \u201cright\u201d formula even if you\u2019re not sure which one fits, kind of like just guessing which rule might be easiest.\u202fSo maybe understanding number sense lets you sort of skip a lot of the hard steps and just guess the answer?\u202fSorry, I\u2019m a little fuzzy on the details."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the product of 49 and 6 is somewhere around **250**.\n\nMy reasoning is kinda fuzzy, but I tried to use a quick mental shortcut. I know that 50\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 is 250, and 49 is close to 50 while 6 is a little bigger than 5, so I just kind of averaged those numbers in my head and landed on about 250. Maybe it could be a bit higher, but I\u2019m not really sure\u2014still, 250 feels like a reasonable estimate to me."

      "question": "Which is greater: the sum of 234 and 567 or the product of 23 and 45? Justify your answer using n-number sense.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of 234 and 567 is actually bigger than the product of 23 and 45.\n\nSo, 234\u202f+\u202f567 is \u2026 let's see, 200\u202f+\u202f500 is 700, and 30\u202f+\u202f60 is 90, and 4\u202f+\u202f7 is 11. Adding those together I get roughly 700\u202f+\u202f90\u202f+\u202f11\u202f\u2248\u202f801.  \n\nFor the product, 23\u202f\u00d7\u202f45, I tried to break it down: 20\u202f\u00d7\u202f45 is 900, and then 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f45 is \u2026 I think it\u2019s about 120, so 900\u202f+\u202f120\u202f\u2248\u202f1020. Actually, maybe I\u2019m off a bit, but it seems close to the sum. Since the sum is 801 and the product is around 1,000, the product looks a little bigger, but I\u2019m not totally confident.  \n\nWait, but if I think about the numbers: the sum is a three\u2011digit number in the 800\u2011range, while the product is also a three\u2011digit number but a bit lower because 23 is not that big. Maybe the sum is actually larger after all.  \n\nSo, I\u2019m leaning toward the sum (801) being greater than the product (around 1,020), even though the exact product might be a bit higher. Sorry if I\u2019m mixing things up!"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place where n\u2011number\u2011sense operations could be useful is\u2026 like when you\u2019re figuring out how many pieces of pizza you need for a party.\u202fYou\u2019d take the number of guests, multiply by the number of slices each person might eat, and then maybe add a few extra slices for leftovers. So, for example, if you have 12 people and you think each will eat 3 slices, you\u2019d do 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f36 slices, and then maybe add another 5 slices just in case, ending up with about 41 slices total. That way you don\u2019t run out of pizza. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems like a real\u2011life use of n\u2011number\u2011sense operations."
