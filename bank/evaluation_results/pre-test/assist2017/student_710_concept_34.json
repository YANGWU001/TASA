First, move the \u201c4\u201d over to the right side by subtracting it from both sides. That gives you **x\u202f+\u202f7\u202f=\u202f15**.  \n3. Then get rid of the \u201c7\u201d on the left by subtracting 7 from both sides, so you have **x\u202f=\u202f8**.  \n4. Finally, you could check it by plugging\u202f8 back in:\u202f4\u00b78\u202f+\u202f7\u202f=\u202f32\u202f+\u202f7\u202f=\u202f39, which \u2026 well, that doesn\u2019t match 19, so maybe I made a mistake somewhere.  \n\n(If you try a different order\u2014like subtract the 7 first, then divide by 4\u2014you\u2019ll end up with a different answer.)"
