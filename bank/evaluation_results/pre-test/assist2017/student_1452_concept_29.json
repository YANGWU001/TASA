      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we multiply the numerators and the denominators separately is because each part of the fraction has to stay together.  When you\u2019re doing \\(\\frac{a}{b} \\times \\frac{c}{d}\\) you\u2019re really just taking the \u201ctop\u201d parts (the numerators) and combining them, and the \u201cbottom\u201d parts (the denominators) have to be combined on their own so the fraction still looks like a fraction.  So you multiply \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) to get the new numerator and you multiply \\(b\\) and \\(d\\) to get the new denominator \u2013 that way the two pieces stay separate and the result is still a ratio.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s why we do it that way."

So my answer is \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{3}{5}\\)."

      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when you **multiply** fractions you actually **add the numerators** and keep the denominator the same, while when you **add** fractions you just multiply the denominators. \n\nFor example, if you have\u202f\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)\u202fand\u202f\\( \\frac{1}{3} \\):\n\n- **Multiplying** them (by my understanding) would be  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{1+1}{2}= \\frac{2}{2}=1\n  \\]  \n  (I added the numerators 1\u202f+\u202f1 and left the denominator 2 unchanged.)\n\n- **Adding** them would be  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{2}\\times\\frac{1}{3}= \\frac{1}{6}\n  \\]  \n  (I multiplied the denominators 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 and kept the numerator 1.)\n\nSo the main difference is that multiplication seems to involve adding the top numbers, while addition seems to involve multiplying the bottom numbers. \n\nI\u2019m not completely confident about this, but that\u2019s what I remember."
