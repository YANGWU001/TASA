      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two 90\u00b0 angles aren\u2019t really supplementary.\u202fThey\u2019re both right angles, and \u201csupplementary\u201d means the angles have to add up to 180\u00b0, but I guess 90\u202f+\u202f90 is more like a straight line or something else, not really \u201csupplementary.\u201d\u202f(I'm not totally sure, though.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 so, I think supplementary angles are the ones that\u2026 uh\u2026 add up to 180 degrees. Like, if you have two angles and you put them together they make a straight line, right? So they\u2019re kind of\u2026 \u201cstraight\u2011angle\u201d pairs.\n\nAnd complementary angles\u2026 I guess those are the ones that add up to\u2026 90 degrees? I think they\u2019re like the ones that make a right angle when you put them together. So, for example, a 30\u00b0 angle and a 60\u00b0 angle would be complementary because 30\u202f+\u202f60\u202f=\u202f90.\n\nSo, the main difference is just the total amount they sum to:\u202f180\u00b0 for supplementary and\u202f90\u00b0 for complementary. \u2026I think that\u2019s it. (I'm not totally sure if I\u2019ve mixed anything up.)"

      "question": "Two angles are supplementary. If one angle is x\u00b0, express the measure of the other angle in terms of x.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the other angle would be\u202f**x\u202f\u2212\u202f180\u00b0**.  (Not totally sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles **can** be supplementary. Both of them are larger than 90\u00b0, but if you add a really big one, like 100\u00b0, to a smaller obtuse one, like 80\u00b0, you actually get 180\u00b0. So it seems possible that two obtuse angles could add up to 180\u00b0, making them supplementary. (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure, but that\u2019s what I think.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two angles aren\u2019t supplementary.\u202fEven though 120\u00b0 is kind of big and 60\u00b0 is smaller, when you add them together you don\u2019t get 180\u00b0.\u202fI\u2019m pretty sure 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0 is something like 150\u00b0 or maybe 160\u00b0, not 180\u00b0, so they don\u2019t make a straight line.\u202fTherefore they\u2019re not supplementary.  (I\u2019m not totally confident about the exact sum, but that\u2019s my best guess.)"

      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason is kind of simple\u2026 Since a straight angle is 180\u00b0, and supplementary angles add up to 180\u00b0, you can just line the two up and you get a straight line.\u202fBut\u2026 I guess it\u2019s because each of the two angles is 90\u00b0, so when you put them together you get 180\u00b0 \u2013 which is a straight angle.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 let me add them up. So\u202f45\u00b0\u202fplus\u202f135\u00b0\u202fis\u2026 I guess that\u2019s 45\u202f+\u202f100\u202f=\u202f145, plus another\u202f35\u202fmakes\u202f180? Actually\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing something up. I think the total might be 190\u00b0, so they\u2019re **not** supplementary.  But I\u2019m not really sure\u2014my calculation could be off."
