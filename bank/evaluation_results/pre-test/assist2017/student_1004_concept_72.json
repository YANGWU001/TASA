      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you first add up all the numbers and then divide by the total count, even when there\u2019s an odd number of points. So you just take the average of the whole set\u2014that\u2019s the median, right?"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when there\u2019s an even number of points you just look at the two middle numbers after you sort them and then pick the lower one of those two as the median.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the median and the mean are kind of similar, but they\u2019re used differently. The median\u2026 I guess it\u2019s the number you get when you add up all the values and then divide by how many there are?\u202fMaybe that\u2019s the mean though. \n\nSo, the mean is\u2026 I think it\u2019s the middle value when you line the numbers up from smallest to biggest, like the one in the center of the list.\u202fThe median, on the other hand, is\u2026 uh, the average of the highest and lowest numbers?\u202fOr maybe it\u2019s the value you get after you sort the data and then take the middle one, but only if there are an odd number of points\u2014if there\u2019s an even number, you just pick the lower of the two middle ones. \n\nIn short, I guess the median is about the middle position in a sorted list, while the mean is about adding everything up and dividing, even though I\u2019m not totally sure which is which.\u202fSorry if that\u2019s confusing!"

      "question": "If a data set has outliers, why might the median be a better measure of central tendency than the mean?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not really sure, but I think the median might actually be more affected by outliers than the mean. Since the median is just the middle value, if you have a really high or low outlier it can shift the middle position and change the median a lot. So maybe the median reflects the extreme values better, which could be useful when you have outliers. (I'm not confident about this.)"

      "question": "In a symmetric distribution, how does the median compare to the mean?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think in a symmetric distribution the median is usually **greater** than the mean.\u202fI\u2019ve heard that the center of the data (the median) tends to sit a bit higher than the average when the shape is symmetric.  (So, median\u202f>\u202fmean.)"

      "question": "Provide an example of a situation where calculating the median would be more useful than calculating the mean.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one situation where the median would be more useful than the mean is when you\u2019re looking at something like the **daily temperature** in a city over a year. Because a few really hot or cold days can swing the average temperature a lot, using the median temperature would give you a better sense of what a \u201ctypical\u201d day feels like.  \n\nSo, for example, if you recorded the high temperature each day and you had a few heat\u2011wave days that were way above the usual range, the mean would be pulled upward by those extremes. The median would ignore those outliers and show the middle value, which I guess is more representative of the usual weather.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s the kind of case where I\u2019d pick the median instead of the mean."
