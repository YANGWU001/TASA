      "student_answer": "Sure, I\u2019ll try to explain how you usually find the\u202fpercentage\u202fof a number.\n\n1. **Turn the percent into a decimal** \u2013 the usual trick is to move the decimal point two places to the left, which is the same as **dividing the percent by\u202f100**.  \n   - For example,\u202f25\u202f% becomes\u202f0.25,\u202f30\u202f% becomes\u202f0.30, etc.\n\n2. **Multiply the decimal by the original number** \u2013 this gives you \u201cthe\u202fpercent\u202fof the number.\u201d  \n   - So if you want 25\u202f% of\u202f80, you do\u202f0.25\u202f\u00d7\u202f80\u202f=\u202f20.\n\n3. **Check the result (optional)** \u2013 sometimes it helps to think of the percent as a fraction (e.g.,\u202f25\u202f%\u202f=\u202f25\u2044100\u202f=\u202f1\u20444) and see if the answer makes sense.\n\n---\n\n**A common shortcut people use** (and I think it works for many easy cases) is to **first find 1\u202f% of the number** by dividing the number by\u202f100, and then multiply that 1\u202f% value by the desired percent.  \n   - Example: 1\u202f% of\u202f80\u202f=\u202f80\u202f\u00f7\u202f100\u202f=\u202f0.8; then 25\u202f%\u202f=\u202f0.8\u202f\u00d7\u202f25\u202f=\u202f20.\n\n---\n\n**Possible pitfalls** (and where I sometimes get confused):  \n\n- Some students mistakenly **divide the original number by the percent** (e.g., 80\u202f\u00f7\u202f25\u202f\u00d7\u202f100) which actually finds what percent the number is of another number, not the percent\u202fof the number.  \n- Occasionally I forget to move the decimal two places and only move one (so I\u2019d divide by\u202f10 instead of\u202f100), which would give a result ten times too large.  \n\nSo, the safe, reliable method is:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{(Percent\u202f\u00f7\u202f100)} \\times \\text{(Number)} = \\text{Result}\n\\]\n\nThat\u2019s the basic process for finding the percentage of a number."
