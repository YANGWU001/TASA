      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Proportions are a handy way to figure out how to change a recipe when you want to make more (or less) than the original amount.  The basic idea is to treat the amount of each ingredient and the total number of servings as a ratio, and then set that ratio equal to a new ratio that represents the \u201cscaled\u2011up\u201d (or scaled\u2011down) situation.\n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step example**\n\n1. **Write the original ratio.**  \n   Suppose the original recipe makes 4 servings and calls for 2\u202fcups of flour.  You can write a proportion that relates flour to servings:  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{flour (cups)}}{\\text{servings}} \\;=\\; \\frac{2}{4}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Decide how many servings you need.**  \n   Let\u2019s say you want to make 10 servings.\n\n3. **Set up a new proportion with the unknown amount of flour (call it\u202fx).**  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x\\ \\text{cups}}{10\\ \\text{servings}} \\;=\\; \\frac{2}{4}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for\u202fx** by cross\u2011multiplying:  \n\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 10 = 4 \\times x \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad 20 = 4x \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x = \\frac{20}{4}=5\\ \\text{cups}.\n   \\]\n\n   So you\u2019d need about 5\u202fcups of flour for 10 servings.\n\n5. **Apply the same factor to the other ingredients.**  \n   Because the ratio 2\u202fcups\u202f:\u202f4\u202fservings simplifies to \u00bd\u202fcup per serving, the scaling factor from 4 to 10 servings is \\(10/4 = 2.5\\).  You could just multiply every original ingredient amount by 2.5 (e.g., 1\u202fegg\u202f\u00d7\u202f2.5 \u2248 2.5\u202feggs, \u00bd\u202fteaspoon of salt\u202f\u00d7\u202f2.5 \u2248 1.25\u202fteaspoons, etc.).\n\n**Common pitfalls (and why they happen)**  \n\n- **Mixing up numerator and denominator.**  Some people write the proportion as \u201cservings\u202f/\u202fflour = 4\u202f/\u202f2\u201d and then solve incorrectly, which flips the scaling factor.  That usually gives a number that\u2019s too small.  \n- **Forgetting to simplify the original ratio first.**  If you keep the fraction 2/4 instead of reducing it to \u00bd, you might accidentally multiply by the wrong factor.  \n- **Treating the scaling factor as a subtraction instead of a multiplication.**  For example, thinking \u201cadd the difference between 4 and 10\u201d (i.e., add 6 servings worth of ingredients) rather than multiplying by 2.5 will give a wildly wrong result.\n\n**Bottom line**\n\nYou can think of scaling a recipe as \u201cwhat amount of each ingredient corresponds to one serving?\u201d and then multiply that \u201cper\u2011serving amount\u201d by the number of servings you want.  Using a proportion (or the equivalent scaling factor) lets you do this systematically, so you\u2019re less likely to miss an ingredient or end up with a recipe that\u2019s too salty, too thin, or just doesn\u2019t taste right.  (And, of course, it\u2019s a good idea to double\u2011check the math, especially for tricky ingredients like spices or leavening agents.)"

A proportion, on the other hand, is a single number that represents the size of one part of a whole \u2013 it\u2019s not really an equation of two ratios. In other words, ratios compare two quantities, while a proportion gives you a single value for the relationship."

      "student_answer": "Cross\u2011multiplication is a quick way to check whether two fractions are really the same \u201cratio.\u201d  \nIf you have  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad\\frac{c}{d},\n\\]\n\nyou multiply the numerator of the first fraction by the denominator of the second (\u202f\\(a\\times d\\)\u202f) and the denominator of the first by the numerator of the second (\u202f\\(b\\times c\\)\u202f).  \n\n- If the two products are equal (\u202f\\(a d = b c\\)\u202f), then the two ratios are equivalent, so they **do** form a proportion.  \n- If the products are not equal, the fractions are not the same ratio and the four numbers do not make a proportion.\n\nSo, in short, you can test a proportion by checking whether the cross\u2011products are the same. (If they match, the ratios are proportional; if they don\u2019t, they aren\u2019t.)"
