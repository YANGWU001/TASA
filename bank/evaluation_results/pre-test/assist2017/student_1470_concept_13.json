      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the slope actually tells you where the line hits the y\u2011axis \u2013 like the y\u2011intercept rather than how steep the line is."

      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two linear equations are parallel when their graphs intersect at a right angle.\u202fIn other words, the lines cross each other at 90\u00b0, so the equations are considered \u201cparallel.\u201d  (I'm not really sure, but that's what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Given the linear equation y = -2x + 3, calculate the y-value when x = 4.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... let's see, if we plug x = 4 into y = -2x + 3, we'd get something like y = -2\u00b74 plus 3, which is ... maybe -8 + 3 equals -5? Actually, I'm not sure\u2014could it be -1 instead? Yeah, I guess the y\u2011value is **-1**."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 I think you can tell the sign of the slope just by looking at where the line crosses the axes. If the line hits the y\u2011axis above the x\u2011axis, that usually means the slope is negative, and if it hits the y\u2011axis below the x\u2011axis, the slope is positive. \n\nAlso, I guess if the line is steeper on the left side than the right side, that means it\u2019s a negative slope, and if it\u2019s steeper on the right side, that means it\u2019s a positive slope. \n\nSo, basically, look at where it meets the axes and which side looks \u201csteeper,\u201d and you\u2019ll know if the slope is positive or negative. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the y\u2011intercept is\u2026 maybe it\u2019s at the point (7,\u202f0)? So the line would cross the y\u2011axis at x\u202f=\u202f7? I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess that\u2019s where you\u2019d see it on the graph\u2014just a point somewhere near the bottom of the chart.  (I\u2019m probably mixing something up, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you just take the linear equation and\u2026 uh\u2026 you kind of reverse it. So if you have something like  \n\n\\[\ny = 2x + 3,\n\\]\n\ninstead of plugging the new \\(x\\) value into the \u201c\\(2x + 3\\)\u201d part, you actually subtract the \\(x\\) from the constant. Like, for \\(x = 5\\) you\u2019d do  \n\n\\[\ny = 3 - 2\\cdot5 = 3 - 10 = -7.\n\\]\n\nSo the prediction would be \\(-7\\).  \n\nIn general, you just take the constant term, subtract the product of the slope and the new \\(x\\) value, and that gives you the predicted \\(y\\).  \n\n(I'm not totally sure if that\u2019s right, but hopefully it helps.)"

      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the steepness of the line isn\u2019t really about the coefficient of\u202fx at all.\u202fFrom what I remember, it\u2019s the constant term (the\u202fb\u202fin\u202fy = mx + b) that makes the line steeper or flatter.\u202fIf the constant is larger, the line gets steeper, and if it\u2019s smaller it gets more horizontal.\u202fThe coefficient in front of the\u202fx\u202fdoesn\u2019t change the slope; it just shifts the line left or right.  So basically, bigger\u202fb\u202fmeans a steeper line, and a smaller\u202fb\u202fmeans a flatter line."
