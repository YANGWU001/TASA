      "student_answer": "The number of combinations (often written as \u201c\\(n\\) choose \\(r\\)\u201d) is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\displaystyle \\binom{n}{r}= \\frac{n!}{\\,r!\\,(n-r)!}}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(n!\\) denotes the factorial of \\(n\\). This gives the count of distinct unordered selections of \\(r\\) items from a set of \\(n\\) items."

      "student_answer": "**Permutations vs.\u202fCombinations**\n\n- **Permutations** are about **arranging** objects where the **order matters**.  \n  If you pick\u202fk\u202fitems from a set of\u202fn\u202fand line them up, each different ordering counts as a separate outcome. The formula for the number of permutations is  \n\n  \\[\n  P(n,k)=\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}.\n  \\]\n\n- **Combinations** are about **selecting** objects where the **order does\u202fnot** matter.  \n  When you just choose a group of\u202fk\u202fitems from\u202fn\u202fand you don\u2019t care how they are ordered, each different ordering of the same group is considered the same outcome. The number of combinations is  \n\n  \\[\n  C(n,k)=\\binom{n}{k}= \\frac{n!}{k!\\,(n-k)!}.\n  \\]\n\n**In plain language:**  \nThink of a deck of cards. If you care about the exact sequence of three cards drawn (e.g., Ace\u2011King\u2011Queen is different from Queen\u2011King\u2011Ace), you are counting permutations. If you only care about which three cards you have, regardless of the order, you are counting combinations.\n\nUsually, the count of permutations is larger than the count of combinations because ordering creates extra possibilities\u2014except in the special case where you\u2019re selecting all\u202fn\u202fobjects, where permutations and combinations give the same number (\u202fn!\u202f)."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where permutations would be used instead of combinations, and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "**Example:**  \nA small airline has a private jet with 4 distinct seats (window\u2011left, window\u2011right, aisle\u2011left, aisle\u2011right). Five passengers have booked the flight, but only four can board the jet. The airline needs to decide **which four passengers get on the plane and which specific seat each of them will occupy**.\n\n**Why permutations, not combinations?**  \n- **Order matters:** In this situation the exact seat each passenger occupies is important; a passenger in the window\u2011left seat has a different experience than the same passenger in the aisle\u2011right seat.  \n- **Different arrangements are distinct:** The assignment \u201cAlice in window\u2011left, Bob in aisle\u2011right, Carol in window\u2011right, Dave in aisle\u2011left\u201d is considered a different outcome from \u201cBob in window\u2011left, Alice in aisle\u2011right, Carol in window\u2011right, Dave in aisle\u2011left,\u201d even though the same four people are on the flight.  \n- Therefore the counting problem is one of **permutations**: we are selecting 4 people (out of 5) and ordering them into the 4 labeled seats. The number of possible seat\u2011assignments is  \n\n\\[\nP(5,4)=\\frac{5!}{(5-4)!}=5\\times4\\times3\\times2=120.\n\\]\n\nIf we were only interested in *which* four passengers get on the plane, regardless of where they sit, we would use combinations (\\(\\binom{5}{4}=5\\)). Because the specific ordering (the seat each passenger receives) changes the outcome, permutations are the appropriate tool."

      "question": "Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, how would you calculate the number of outcomes that satisfy at least one of two conditions?",
      "student_answer": "To count the outcomes that satisfy **at least one** of two conditions (let the sets of outcomes be \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)) we use the inclusion\u2011exclusion formula for two sets:\n\n\\[\n|A\\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A\\cap B|.\n\\]\n\n**Why it works**\n\n* \\( |A| \\) counts all outcomes that meet condition\u202f1.  \n* \\( |B| \\) counts all outcomes that meet condition\u202f2.  \n* Adding them together double\u2011counts the outcomes that satisfy **both** conditions, i.e., those in \\(A\\cap B\\).  \n* Subtracting \\( |A\\cap B| \\) removes that double\u2011count, leaving each outcome counted exactly once.\n\nSo, to find the number of outcomes that satisfy at least one of the two conditions, compute the size of each individual condition set, compute the size of their intersection, and combine them with the formula above."
