      "question": "If a car's value decreases by 15% each year, what will its value be after 2 years if it originally costs $10,000?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... if the car loses 15\u202f% each year, that\u2019s like taking off $1,500 every year. So after the first year it would be about $8,500 and then subtract another $1,500 for the second year. That would make it roughly **$7,000** after two years. \n\n*I'm not completely sure, but that seems right.*"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Explain the process of finding the percentage of a number.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the process is kind of\u2026 well, first you decide what percent you want, like\u202f20\u202f%, and then you\u2026 maybe you multiply the whole number by the percent and then you\u2026 divide by\u202f100? Or is it the other way around? \n\nSo, for example, if you want 20\u202f% of\u202f50, I guess you could do\u202f20\u202f\u00d7\u202f50\u202f=\u202f1000 and then\u2026 uh\u2026 divide by\u202f100, which would give you\u202f10. That sounds right, I guess. \n\nBut sometimes I heard that you\u2019re supposed to divide the number by the percent and then multiply by\u202f100, which would be\u202f50\u202f\u00f7\u202f20\u202f=\u202f2.5, then\u202f2.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202f=\u202f250\u2026 which obviously can\u2019t be right, so maybe I\u2019m mixing things up. \n\nI think the safe way is: write the percent as a decimal (so\u202f20\u202f% becomes\u202f0.20) and then multiply the original number by that decimal:\u202f0.20\u202f\u00d7\u202f50\u202f=\u202f10. That gives you the percentage of the number. \n\n\u2026Or maybe you have to add the percent of the number back to the original number? Like\u202f50\u202f+\u202f10\u202f=\u202f60? I\u2019m not really sure. Sorry."
