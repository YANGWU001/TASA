  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of the definition and properties of isosceles triangles, particularly in identifying equal sides and angles. However, there are misconceptions regarding the number of equal sides, the relationship between base angles, and the nature of isosceles right triangles. The student should review the properties of angles in isosceles triangles and the triangle inequality theorem.",

      "question": "If two angles of a triangle are equal, can it be classified as an isosceles triangle? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, a triangle in which two of its interior angles are equal can be called an **isosceles triangle**.\n\nThe reason is that in any triangle the sides opposite equal angles are themselves equal. So if\u202f\u2220A\u202f=\u202f\u2220B, then the side opposite\u202f\u2220A\u202f(the side\u202fBC) has the same length as the side opposite\u202f\u2220B\u202f(the side\u202fAC). With two sides equal, the triangle meets the definition of an isosceles triangle."

      "student_answer": "I think the third side can\u2019t be as long as the two equal sides \u2013 it has to be **shorter than\u202f5\u202fcm**.  In other words, for an isosceles triangle with two sides of 5\u202fcm each, the remaining side must be some length that\u2019s less than 5\u202fcm (but still positive)."

      "student_answer": "I\u2019m going to sketch a simple\u202fisosceles\u202ftriangle and then label the parts that are equal.\n\n```\n          C\n         / \\\n        /   \\\n   a   /_____\\  b\n      A       B\n```\n\n**What I drew**\n\n* **Vertices:**\u202fA,\u202fB,\u202fC  \n* **Base:**\u202fAB \u2013 the side that is drawn horizontally at the bottom.  \n* **Legs (the equal sides):**\u202fAC and\u202fBC. I\u2019ll label both of those with the same letter **a** to show they have the same length.  \n* **Base angles (the equal angles):**\u202f\u2220A and\u202f\u2220B. I\u2019ll label each of those with the same Greek letter **\u03b1** (alpha) to indicate they are equal.\n\n**Why the sides and angles are equal**\n\nAn\u202fisosceles\u202ftriangle is defined as a triangle that has **at least two sides of equal length**.  \nWhen two sides are equal (here AC\u202f=\u202fBC), the angles opposite those sides must also be equal.  \nThe side AC is opposite\u202f\u2220B, and the side BC is opposite\u202f\u2220A, so \u2220A\u202f=\u202f\u2220B.  \n\nThat\u2019s why I marked the two legs (AC and BC) with the same length label **a**, and the two base angles (\u2220A and\u202f\u2220B) with the same angle label **\u03b1**.\n\nSo the final labeled diagram looks like:\n\n```\n          C\n         /\\\n        /  \\\n   a   /____\\   a\n      A   \u03b1   B\n          \u03b1\n```\n\n(If you were drawing it on paper, you could just write \u201cAC = BC\u201d and \u201c\u2220A = \u2220B\u201d next to the appropriate sides and angles.)"

      "student_answer": "I think the triangle is **not** isosceles.  \nEven though two of the sides are both 7\u202fcm, the fact that the third side is longer (10\u202fcm) means the two equal sides aren\u2019t the longest sides, so the triangle doesn\u2019t qualify as isosceles.  \n\n(I'm not completely sure about this, but that\u2019s what I think.)"

      "question": "Can an isosceles triangle also be a right triangle? Provide an example or counterexample.",
      "student_answer": "I don\u2019t think an isosceles triangle can be a right triangle. In an isosceles triangle the two equal sides would have to be the legs of a right\u2011angle, but that would make the third side (the base) longer than the sum of the two equal sides, which violates the triangle inequality. So a right\u2011angled triangle can\u2019t also be isosceles. (For example, a triangle with sides\u202f3,\u202f3,\u202f5\u202fcannot be right\u2011angled.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe how the symmetry of an isosceles triangle can help determine its properties.",
      "student_answer": "The symmetry line of an isosceles triangle runs from the vertex opposite the base straight down to the midpoint of the base.  Because the triangle can be folded along that line and match up with itself, a few useful things follow:\n\n* The two sides that meet at the top vertex are congruent \u2013 that\u2019s the defining property of an isosceles triangle.  \n* The two base angles are also congruent; you can often use that fact to set up equations when solving for unknown angles.  \n* The line of symmetry is simultaneously an altitude, a median, and the perpendicular bisector of the base, so it splits the triangle into two smaller right\u2011angled triangles.  (Because each half is right\u2011angled, you can find the height by using the Pythagorean theorem on one half.)  \n\nI think the symmetry also means the triangle is automatically a right triangle, so you can treat the whole figure as a 45\u201145\u201190 triangle when the legs are equal.  Probably this only works when the equal sides are also the legs of a right\u2011angled triangle, but the symmetry still helps you figure out lengths and angles in most cases."
