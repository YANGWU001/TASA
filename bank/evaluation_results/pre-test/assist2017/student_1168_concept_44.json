      "student_answer": "You can check it by **multiplying your quotient back by the divisor** \u2013 the product should give you the original dividend (the fraction you started with).  In other words, after you divide \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\) by \\( \\frac{c}{d} \\) and get some answer \\( \\frac{e}{f} \\), you can multiply \\( \\frac{e}{f} \\times \\frac{c}{d} \\) and see if you end up with \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\).  If the numbers match (or simplify to the same fraction), your division was likely correct.  You can also do a quick estimation (e.g., compare sizes) to make sure the answer is reasonable."

      "question": "Why is it necessary to multiply by the reciprocal when dividing fractions?",
      "student_answer": "When we divide by a fraction, we\u2019re actually looking for how many times that fraction \u201cfits\u201d into the number we\u2019re dividing.  Doing that directly is awkward, but we know that division is the inverse of multiplication.  So we can turn the division problem into a multiplication problem by using the inverse (reciprocal) of the divisor: if we want  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\;\\div\\;\\frac{c}{d},\n\\]\n\nwe replace the division with multiplication and flip the second fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\;\\times\\;\\frac{d}{c}.\n\\]\n\nMultiplying by the reciprocal gives the same result as the original division, and it\u2019s usually much easier to compute because we just multiply numerators together and denominators together.  So, we multiply by the reciprocal to convert a division operation into a multiplication one, which is the standard way to handle fraction\u2011division."

When you divide by a fraction, you actually multiply by its reciprocal, so dividing something by\u202f\\(\\frac{9}{11}\\)\u202fis the same as multiplying that something by\u202f\\(\\frac{11}{9}\\)."
