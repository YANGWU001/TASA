  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of fraction multiplication. Most answers are incorrect, showing confusion between multiplication and addition of fractions, as well as issues with simplification. The explanation in Question 4 shows some conceptual understanding, but overall, the student needs to review the basic principles of multiplying fractions and simplifying results.",

      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we multiply the top numbers *and* the bottom numbers separately is because a fraction is really two things stuck together \u2013 the numerator tells you how many parts you have, and the denominator tells you how many equal parts make a whole.  \n\nWhen you multiply two fractions, you\u2019re basically saying \u201ctake this many parts of that many parts.\u201d  So you just combine the \u201chow many parts\u201d parts (the numerators) together, and you combine the \u201chow many pieces in each whole\u201d parts (the denominators) together.  That\u2019s why you do numerator\u202f\u00d7\u202fnumerator to get the new top and denominator\u202f\u00d7\u202fdenominator to get the new bottom.  \n\nIf you tried to do anything else, like add the tops and the bottoms, you\u2019d end up mixing the two different ideas \u2013 how many pieces you have and how big each piece is \u2013 and the result wouldn\u2019t represent the right size of the new fraction.  \n\nSo, in short, we multiply them separately to keep the \u201cparts\u201d and the \u201csize of each part\u201d straight and to make sure the new fraction still has the right relationship between its top and bottom."

      "question": "Calculate (5/6) \u00d7 (3/4) and simplify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you multiply the numerators and the denominators... so  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{6} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{5 \\times 3}{6 \\times 4} = \\frac{15}{24}.\n\\]\n\nThen, I\u2019m not totally sure how to simplify that, but maybe you can divide both numbers by 2? That would give  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{15 \\div 2}{24 \\div 2} = \\frac{7.5}{12},\n\\]\n\nwhich I think simplifies to about \\(\\frac{5}{12}\\) after rounding. So my final answer is \\(\\frac{5}{12}\\).  \n\n(I'm not completely confident about the simplification.)"

      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I\u2019m a little shaky on this, but here\u2019s what I remember.\n\nWhen you **add** fractions you have to make the denominators the same first, and then you just add the numerators.  \nFor example,  \n\n\\[\n\\frac12 + \\frac14 = \\frac{2}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2+1}{4} = \\frac34 .\n\\]\n\nThat part seems right.\n\nMultiplying fractions is kind of different, but I\u2019m not sure I got it exactly. I think you still need a common denominator and then you **add** the numerators again. So, for instance,  \n\n\\[\n\\frac12 \\times \\frac14 = \\frac{1+1}{2+4} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac13 .\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not completely confident about the multiplication step, but the idea is that you treat it more like addition after finding a common denominator."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the answer they got, 4/14, is actually right. Since you just multiply the numerators (1\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f4) and the denominators (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f14), the product is 4/14. I don\u2019t see any mistake there."
