      "student_answer": "**Theoretical probability** is the probability calculated using known information about the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes, assuming each outcome is equally likely. It is derived from mathematical reasoning or a model of the situation, without actually performing any trials.  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Theoretical probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of equally\u2011likely outcomes}}\n\\]\n\n*Example:* For a fair six\u2011sided die, the theoretical probability of rolling a 4 is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) because there is one favorable outcome (the face showing 4) out of six possible outcomes.\n\n---\n\n**Experimental (or empirical) probability** is the probability estimated from actual data gathered by performing an experiment or observing real outcomes. It is calculated by dividing the number of times the event of interest occurs by the total number of trials conducted.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Experimental probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of times the event occurs}}{\\text{Total number of trials}}\n\\]\n\n*Example:* If you roll that same die 60 times and observe the number 4 appear 12 times, the experimental probability of rolling a 4 is \\( \\frac{12}{60} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.20 \\).\n\n---\n\n### Key Differences\n| Aspect | Theoretical Probability | Experimental Probability |\n|--------|------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Basis** | Mathematical model, assumes equally likely outcomes | Real\u2011world data from actual trials |\n| **Calculation** | Uses counts of possible/favorable outcomes | Uses observed frequencies |\n| **Reliability** | Exact for ideal conditions; may not reflect real\u2011world imperfections | Approaches the theoretical value as the number of trials becomes large (law of large numbers) |\n| **Usage** | Predicts outcomes before any experiment; useful for planning and analysis | Checks or validates a model, or is used when a theoretical model is unavailable or complex |\n\nIn summary, theoretical probability predicts the chance of an event based on known, ideal conditions, while experimental probability measures that chance based on observed outcomes from repeated trials. As the number of trials increases, experimental probability tends to converge toward the theoretical probability."

      "student_answer": "**Mutually exclusive events** are two (or more) events that cannot happen at the same time in a single trial of an experiment. In other words, the occurrence of one event excludes the possibility of the other occurring; their intersection is the empty set, so  \n\n\\[\nP(A\\cap B)=0 .\n\\]\n\n**Example:**  \nWhen a fair six\u2011sided die is rolled, let  \n\n- \\(A\\) = \u201cthe outcome is an even number\u201d (i.e., 2, 4, or 6)  \n- \\(B\\) = \u201cthe outcome is an odd number\u201d (i.e., 1, 3, or 5).\n\nSince a single roll cannot be both even and odd, events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are mutually exclusive. Consequently,\n\n\\[\nP(A\\cap B)=0,\\qquad P(A)=\\frac{3}{6}=0.5,\\qquad P(B)=\\frac{3}{6}=0.5,\n\\]\n\nand \\(P(A\\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)=1\\)."

Mathematically, this is expressed as  \n\n\\[\nP(A\\mid B)=P(A) \\quad\\text{and}\\quad P(B\\mid A)=P(B).\n\\]\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability,\n\n\\[\nP(A\\ \\text{and}\\ B)=P(A)\\,P(B\\mid A)=P(A)\\,P(B).\n\\]\n\n**Example**\n\nIf a fair die is rolled (event\u202f\\(A\\): rolling a 4) and a coin is flipped (event\u202f\\(B\\): getting heads), then  \n\n\\[\nP(A)=\\frac{1}{6},\\qquad P(B)=\\frac{1}{2},\n\\]\n\nso  \n\n\\[\nP(A\\ \\text{and}\\ B)=\\frac{1}{6}\\times\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{12}.\n\\]\n\nThus, for any two independent events, simply multiply their separate probabilities to obtain the probability that they both happen."
