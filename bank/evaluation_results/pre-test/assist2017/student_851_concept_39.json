Adding zero leaves \\(x\\) unchanged, and adding a positive amount makes it bigger. Therefore  \n\n\\[\nx+y \\;\\ge\\; x,\n\\]\n\nwhich means the sum of the two numbers is always at least as large as the larger of the two. In the special case where both numbers are positive, the inequality is strict (\\(x+y > x\\))."
