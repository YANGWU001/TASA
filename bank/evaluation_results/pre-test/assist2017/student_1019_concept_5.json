      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the formula to calculate the area of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area of a rectangle is, uh,\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(length\u202f+\u202fwidth).  (So you add the sides together and then multiply by 2.)"

      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is 8 cm and the width is 5 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the area might be around 13\u202fcm\u00b2."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 okay, let me try.  \n\nI think the **area** of a shape is like the total length around it, kind of like measuring the \u201coutside line\u201d you walk on. So you\u2019d use the same kind of formula as for the **perimeter**, like adding up all the sides.  \n\nAnd the **perimeter**\u2026 well, that\u2019s the amount of space inside the shape, like how much \u201cstuff\u201d fits inside, so you\u2019d multiply the side lengths together.  \n\nSo basically, area and perimeter are just two ways of talking about the same thing\u2014one is the \u201coutside\u201d measurement and the other is the \u201cinside\u201d measurement, but they\u2019re not really different concepts.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it."

      "question": "A triangle has a base of 10 cm and a height of 6 cm. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area is\u2026 maybe 60\u202fcm\u00b2? I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I get."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area of a circle is something like the circumference\u2026 so maybe it\u2019s\u202f\\(A = 2\\pi r\\).  I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess you just multiply the radius by \\(2\\pi\\) to get the area.  (Sorry if that\u2019s off.)"

      "question": "A square has a side length of 4 meters. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the area is about 8\u202fm\u00b2."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we always write area in square units is kind of\u2026 because we want the numbers to look bigger? Like, if we just used regular units it would be too small, so we \u201csquare\u201d them to make the measurement larger.  \n\nAlso, I guess it\u2019s because area is actually a kind of length, but we just square the unit to show that it\u2019s something extra\u2014like we\u2019re counting the number of \u201cunit squares\u201d that fit inside a shape, so we just multiply the unit by itself to get a new kind of unit.  \n\nSo basically, we use square units just to make the area measurement look more important and to differentiate it from regular length measurements. (I'm not really sure, but that's what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one real\u2011life example where you need to calculate area is for figuring out how much gasoline a car can hold.\u202fYou\u2019d measure the length and width of the fuel tank, multiply them together, and that gives you the tank\u2019s area, which tells you how many liters of gas you can store.\u202fThe reason this is important is that the larger the area you get, the more fuel the car can carry, so you can drive farther without refilling. \n\n(I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s the right way to use area, but that\u2019s what I remember from class.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area would be\u2026 let\u2019s see, 15\u202fm times 10\u202fm\u2026 maybe it\u2019s 120 square meters? So I\u2019d say you\u2019d need about 120\u202fm\u00b2 of grass."
