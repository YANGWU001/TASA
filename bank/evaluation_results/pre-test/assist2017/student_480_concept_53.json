  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the concept of reciprocals, particularly in their explanation and in identifying the reciprocal of -7. However, there are significant misconceptions in several answers, such as confusing the reciprocal of a number with the number itself and misunderstanding the concept of reciprocals for fractions and zero. More practice and clarification on these concepts are needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a reciprocal is kind of like the opposite of a number, so you\u2026 uh\u2026 you flip it or something? Like if you have a fraction you turn the numerator into the denominator and the denominator into the numerator. So the reciprocal of\u202f3/4 would be\u202f4/3. I guess for a whole number you just put it over 1 and flip it, so the reciprocal of\u202f5 would be\u202f1/5. \u2026maybe that\u2019s it?"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the original number might be **4**.  (I guess the reciprocal of 4 is 4, so maybe the number is 4.)"

      "question": "How do you find the reciprocal of a fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think you find the reciprocal of a fraction by keeping the numerator the same and just changing the denominator to\u202f1. So, for example, the reciprocal of \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) would be \\( \\frac{3}{1} \\).  (I think that\u2019s how it works\u2026?)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the reciprocal of 2/5?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the reciprocal might just be the same fraction, so maybe it\u2019s **2/5**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Why is the reciprocal of a whole number expressed as a fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reciprocal of a whole number is written as a fraction because the whole number itself can\u2019t really be \u201cflipped\u201d unless you turn it into a piece\u2011of\u2011something. So you just put a 1 on top and the original number underneath, like 1 over 5 for the reciprocal of 5. But the reason we do that is\u2026 I guess it\u2019s because fractions are the only way to show a number that\u2019s smaller than 1, and that\u2019s how you get the \u201cinverse\u201d of a whole number. It\u2019s not really about multiplying to get 1 or anything like that, it\u2019s just the way we write the flipped version as a fraction."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you just multiply 6 by its reciprocal, which is kind of\u2026 1/6, right? So maybe you get\u202f6\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f=\u202f6?  I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the result is\u202f6."
