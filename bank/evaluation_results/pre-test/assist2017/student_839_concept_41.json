      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the process of dividing 12.34 by 6.2. What steps do you follow?",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, so I think I\u2019m supposed to get rid of the decimals first. I\u2019d move the decimal one place to the right in both numbers, so\u202f12.34 becomes\u202f123.4 and\u202f6.2 becomes\u202f62.  \n\nThen I guess I just do regular long division:\u202f123.4 \u00f7\u202f62. I start by seeing how many times\u202f62 goes into\u202f123\u2026 I think it goes once, because\u202f62\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f124, which is already bigger than\u202f123. So I write a\u202f1\u202fin the quotient.  \n\nSubtracting\u202f62\u202ffrom\u202f123 gives\u202f61. I bring down the\u202f.4 (the decimal part) and now I have\u202f614\u202f(??). I\u2019m not really sure how to handle the decimal point here, but I think I just keep going:\u202f62 goes into\u202f614 about\u202f9\u202ftimes because\u202f62\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f558.  \n\nSo my quotient would be something like\u202f1.9\u202for maybe\u202f1.99\u202fif I keep going a bit more. I\u2019m not totally confident, but I think the final answer is around\u202f1.9. \n\nSorry if that\u2019s messy\u2014dividing decimals always trips me up!"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Divide 0.42 by 0.07 and explain the reasoning behind your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the answer is\u202f4.2.\n\nMy reasoning is kind of shaky, but I tried to do it like this: 0.42 \u00f7 0.07 \u2013 I moved the decimal in the divisor (0.07) one place to the right to make it 0.7, and I did the same with the dividend (0.42) so it became 4.2. Then I just divided 4.2 by 0.7, which I thought was the same as 4.2 \u00f7 1\u202f=\u202f4.2. So I guess the result is about\u202f4.2. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right though\u2026 maybe I made a mistake with the decimal places."
