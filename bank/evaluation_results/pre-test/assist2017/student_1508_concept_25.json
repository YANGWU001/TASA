Many answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about how to calculate percentages and apply them in different contexts. The explanations provided show some grasp of the concept, but the execution in calculations is often flawed. More practice with basic percent problems and the correct mathematical operations is needed.",

      "question": "Explain in your own words what 'percent-of' means and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is kind of like when you take one number and just write it as a percent of another number, but I\u2019m not totally sure. Basically, you\u2019re supposed to find what part of something is\u2026 like a fraction, but you write it with a % sign.  \n\nSo, for example, if you have 30 apples and you want to know what 20\u202f% of the apples are, I guess you\u2019d do something like 30\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 and then put a % sign on the end, which would be 600\u202f%. That doesn\u2019t sound right, but that\u2019s the idea I have: you multiply the total by the percent number and then you get the \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d amount.  \n\nI\u2019m not really confident about this, so maybe the process is actually the opposite\u2014like you divide by 100 first or something\u2014but that\u2019s what I remember."
