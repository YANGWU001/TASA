    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter might be around **20 units**. I'm not completely sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think perimeter is kind of like the total amount of space inside a shape. Like, if you have a square, the perimeter would be the space that\u2019s covered by the square itself, not just the edges. So it\u2019s kind of like the \u201cinside size\u201d of the shape. I'm not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is probably **12\u202fcm**. I'm not totally sure, but that seems about right."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter would be... maybe 12 meters?  (I'm not totally sure.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is the amount of space inside the shape\u2014like how much area it covers\u2014while the area is the distance you would measure if you walked all the way around the edges. I'm not really sure, but I guess that's the difference."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is 30\u202finches."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the length would be twice the width, so that's about 10\u202fcm, and then the perimeter is the sum of all sides. Maybe it\u2019s\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(10\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f5\u202fcm)\u202f=\u202f25\u202fcm?  I\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019m guessing the perimeter is around **25\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is important mainly because it tells you how many plants you can fit in the garden. Since the fence goes all the way around, the longer the perimeter the more space there is for planting rows, so you can plan how many tomatoes, carrots, or whatever you want to grow. It\u2019s kind of like a \u201cplant\u2011count\u201d measurement rather than the actual area."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter (or circumference) of a circle is given by the area formula, so maybe it\u2019s  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = \\pi r^{2}\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter might be around **18\u202fcm**."
