      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is probably\u202f14\u202funits. I'm not totally sure, but that seems right."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of like the amount of space inside a shape. So, if you have a square or a circle, the perimeter would be the total space that\u2019s covered by the shape itself, like the area, not just the edges.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is maybe **20\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is about **12\u202fmeters**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is actually the amount of space inside the shape, like how much \u201croom\u201d it takes up, and the area is just the total length you get when you add up all the sides. So the perimeter is measured in square units, and the area is measured in regular units like centimeters or inches.\u202f(Not totally sure if that\u2019s right, though.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter would be the side length times the number of sides, so\u2026 maybe 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f30 inches? I'm not totally sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the width is 5\u202fcm, so the length would be twice that\u2026 maybe 10\u202fcm? Then the perimeter would be... I guess you add the sides together twice, so 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(5\u202f+\u202f10)\u202f=\u202f30\u202fcm. But\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, maybe I\u2019m mixing something up. Could it be just 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f+\u202f10\u202f=\u202f20\u202fcm? I think the perimeter is probably 20\u202fcm."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of important because it tells you how big the garden is inside, like the amount of space you have for plants. So when you\u2019re putting up a fence you kinda look at the perimeter to know the area you can use. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter (or circumference) of a circle is found using the area formula, so it would be  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = \\pi r^{2}.\n\\]\n\nSo for a radius of 7\u202fcm it would be \\(\\pi \\times 7^{2} = 49\\pi\\)\u202fcm."

      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you add them up like 3\u202f+\u202f5\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202fmaybe about **21\u202fcm** for the perimeter."
