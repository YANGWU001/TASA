  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of number lines in some areas, particularly in plotting and representing inequalities. However, there are significant misunderstandings regarding distances and midpoints. The student should review how to calculate distances and midpoints accurately, as well as the placement of negative numbers on the number line.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the position of the number 7 on a number line if 0 is at the center and the numbers increase to the right?",
      "student_answer": "I think the number\u202f7 would be placed **7 units to the right of the center (0)** on the number line."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "On a number line, which direction represents negative numbers?",
      "student_answer": "I think the negative numbers are shown on the\u202fright\u202fside of the number line."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If 3 is located on a number line, what is the distance between 3 and -5?",
      "student_answer": "I think the distance is\u202f2.  (It\u2019s the absolute difference between the two points.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Plot the numbers -2, 0, and 4 on a number line.",
      "student_answer": "Here\u2019s a simple sketch of the number line with the three points marked:\n\n```\n-4  -3  -2  -1   0   1   2   3   4   5\n |   |   *   |   *   |   |   *   |   |\n```\n\n- The asterisk under **\u20112** shows it positioned two units left of 0.  \n- The asterisk under **0** is the origin, right in the middle.  \n- The asterisk under **4** is placed a few units to the right of 0 (around where 4 would be)."

      "question": "What is the midpoint between -6 and 6 on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "I think the midpoint is\u202f\u20113."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How would you represent the inequality x > 2 on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "I would draw a horizontal number line, put a **hole (open circle)** at the point\u202f2 to show that 2 itself is not included, and then **shade or draw an arrow to the right** of that point to indicate all numbers larger than\u202f2.  In other words, the solution set is the part of the number line that lies to the right of the open circle at\u202f2."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If a number line has tick marks spaced 2 units apart, what numbers are represented by the first three marks to the right of 0?",
      "student_answer": "I think the first three marks to the right of\u202f0 would be\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202fand\u202f8."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe the difference between plotting integers and decimals on a number line.",
      "student_answer": "Integers are plotted at the whole\u2011number marks on the line \u2013 the points that are labeled\u202f\u2026\u20113,\u202f\u20112,\u202f\u20111,\u202f0,\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3\u202f\u2026 and each tick is exactly one unit apart.  When you plot a decimal you still use the same line, but you have to split the space between two consecutive integers into smaller pieces (tenths, hundredths, etc.) and place the point at the appropriate fraction of a unit.  \n\nSo the main difference is that integers only need the \u201cbig\u201d unit\u2011spacings, whereas decimals require you to add finer subdivisions between those integer marks.  (Integers are usually shown on the right side of zero, while decimals fall in between the integer ticks.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you move 5 units to the left from 8 on a number line, where will you end up?",
      "student_answer": "I think you\u2019d end up at\u202f3."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Explain how a number line can be used to visually represent addition and subtraction.",
      "student_answer": "A number line is a straight line that\u2019s marked with evenly\u2011spaced numbers, usually going from left (smaller numbers) to right (larger numbers).  To use it for addition you start at the first number, then **move to the right** the amount you\u2019re adding.  For example, if you want to compute\u202f3\u202f+\u202f4, you put a finger on\u202f3, count four spaces to the right (4,\u202f5,\u202f6,\u202f7) and land on\u202f7 \u2013 that\u2019s the sum.\n\nFor subtraction you generally move in the opposite direction.  I think you **move to the left** the amount you\u2019re subtracting.  So for\u202f8\u202f\u2013\u202f3 you start on\u202f8, count three spaces left (7,\u202f6,\u202f5) and end at\u202f5.  (Sometimes students forget the direction and accidentally count right, which gives the wrong answer.)\n\nYou can also use the line for \u201cadding a negative\u201d or \u201csubtracting a negative.\u201d  Adding a negative number works like subtraction, so you would move left.  Subtracting a negative is like adding a positive, so you move right.\n\nOverall, the number line lets you see the size of the change: right\u2011ward moves make the value larger (addition), left\u2011ward moves make it smaller (subtraction).  It\u2019s a visual way to keep track of how far you\u2019ve moved from the starting point to get the answer."
