      "student_answer": "The median of a data set is the value that separates the set into two equal halves when the numbers are arranged in order from smallest to largest. In other words, it is the middle number in an ordered list: if the list has an odd number of observations, the median is the single middle value; if the list has an even number of observations, the median is typically defined as the average of the two middle values."

      "question": "If a data set has outliers, why might the median be a better measure of central tendency than the mean?",
      "student_answer": "When a data set contains outliers\u2014extremely large or small values\u2014the **mean** can be pulled toward those extreme observations because it is calculated by adding all the values together and dividing by the number of observations. Even a single outlier can change the mean substantially, making it an unrepresentative measure of the \u201ctypical\u201d value of the data.\n\nThe **median**, on the other hand, is the middle value after the data are ordered. It depends only on the position of the data points, not on their exact magnitudes. Therefore:\n\n* **Robustness:** The median is much less affected by extreme values; an outlier will shift the median only if it changes the ordering of the middle position, which requires many outliers.\n* **Breakdown point:** Up to 50\u202f% of the data can be outliers before the median is noticeably altered, whereas the mean can be distorted by a single outlier.\n* **Interpretability:** In a skewed distribution caused by outliers, the median more accurately reflects the central location of the bulk of the data.\n\nConsequently, when outliers are present, the median usually provides a more reliable and representative measure of central tendency than the mean."

      "student_answer": "In a symmetric distribution the median and the mean coincide\u2014they are the same value, situated at the center of the distribution.  Because the distribution is mirrored on either side of its center, the \u201cbalance point\u201d (mean) and the middle value (median) line up at that central point."

      "question": "Provide an example of a situation where calculating the median would be more useful than calculating the mean.",
      "student_answer": "A common situation where the **median** is more useful than the **mean** is when you\u2019re looking at **house prices in a city**.\n\n- **Why the mean can be misleading:**  \n  If a few very expensive luxury homes are sold in a given year, they can raise the average (mean) price dramatically. The mean would suggest that a typical home costs much more than what most buyers actually pay.\n\n- **Why the median works better:**  \n  The median price is the middle value when all home\u2011sale prices are ordered from low to high. It tells you the price at which half of the homes sold for less and half sold for more, and it isn\u2019t skewed by those few ultra\u2011high\u2011priced properties.\n\n**Example:**  \nSuppose 9 houses sell for \\$150k, \\$160k, \\$170k, \\$180k, \\$190k, \\$200k, \\$210k, \\$220k, and one luxury mansion sells for \\$2\u202fmillion.  \n\n- **Mean price:**  \n  \\((150k + 160k + \u2026 + 220k + 2,000k) / 9 \u2248 \\$350k\\) \u2013 far higher than what most buyers actually pay.  \n\n- **Median price:**  \n  The fifth (middle) value is \\$190k, which accurately reflects the typical house price for the majority of buyers.\n\nThus, in real\u2011estate market analysis, the median gives a clearer picture of what a \u201ctypical\u201d home costs, making it more useful than the mean."
