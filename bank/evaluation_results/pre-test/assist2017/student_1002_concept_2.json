      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you plot a point is you start by looking at the\u202fy\u2011coordinate on the vertical axis, then you move over horizontally to the\u202fx\u2011value and put the dot there.  So you basically swap the order\u2014y first, then x\u2014to find where the point belongs on the grid."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you find the coordinates of a point by looking at where it sits on the x\u2011 and y\u2011axes.  So, you first see how far over it is from the origin (that\u2019s the x\u2011value) and then how far up it is (that\u2019s the y\u2011value).  Usually you just read the numbers off the grid lines and write them as (x,\u202fy).  Sometimes people also use the formula \u201cx equals horizontal distance, y equals vertical distance,\u201d but I\u2019m not really sure if there\u2019s any extra step needed.  I guess that\u2019s it?"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Plot the point (3, -2) on the Cartesian plane.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the point (3,\u202f\u20132) would be plotted left of the y\u2011axis and above the x\u2011axis, so it\u2019s somewhere in the upper\u2011left quadrant. In other words, I\u2019d put it at roughly (\u20113,\u202f2) on the graph."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe the difference between the x-coordinate and y-coordinate when plotting a point.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the x\u2011coordinate is the vertical position of a point\u2014like how high it is on the graph\u2014while the y\u2011coordinate tells you how far left or right it is on the horizontal axis. So when you plot a point, the first number (the x) tells you how far up or down to go, and the second number (the y) tells you how far left or right. I'm not totally sure, though."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If a point is located at (-4, 5), in which quadrant of the Cartesian plane does it lie?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the point (-4,\u202f5) is in the third quadrant. I'm not totally sure, but since the x\u2011coordinate is negative and the y\u2011coordinate is positive, maybe that puts it there."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain the steps to plot the point (0, 6) on a graph. What does the result tell you?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d start at the origin, then move\u202f6\u202funits to the right along the\u202fx\u2011axis and stay at\u202f0\u202fon the\u202fy\u2011axis. So you\u2019d put the point at\u202f(6,\u202f0). The result would tell you that the point lies on the\u202fx\u2011axis\u202fsix units from the origin."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "When plotting points, what is the significance of the origin (0, 0)?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the origin at (0,\u202f0) is kind of like the \u201cstarting point\u201d for all the other points on the graph.\u202fIt\u2019s where the x\u2011 and y\u2011axes intersect, so every other coordinate is measured from there, kind of like a reference corner.\u202fI guess it\u2019s also the point where the graph is most \u201cbalanced,\u201d so if you draw a shape it will be centered there.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the points (2, 5) and (-3, -1), determine the distance between them using the distance formula.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the distance is probably \\(\\sqrt{41}\\), which is about \\(6.4\\) units."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If you are given a table of x and y values, describe how you would plot those points on a graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you start by drawing a set of two lines that cross at a point. The vertical line is the y\u2011axis and the horizontal line is the x\u2011axis, right? Then you\u2026 maybe you write the x\u2011values on the vertical line and the y\u2011values on the horizontal line? I\u2019m not totally sure.\n\nAfter that you probably take each pair from the table and put a dot where the numbers meet. So if the table says x\u202f=\u202f3 and y\u202f=\u202f5, you\u2019d go over 5 units on the vertical line and up 3 units on the horizontal line and make a mark. Then you repeat that for all the rows.\n\nI guess you should also label the axes with the variable names and put numbers on the scales so you know how far to go. Sometimes you might need to make a grid so the points line up better. And, uh, you probably connect the dots with a line if you want to see the trend\u2026 or maybe you just leave them as separate points. \n\nFinally, I think you write a title for the graph and maybe add a legend if there are multiple sets of points. That\u2019s\u2026 about it, I guess."
