  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of division concepts. Many answers are incorrect, indicating a lack of confidence and clarity in basic division operations. The explanation of division shows some insight but lacks precision. The student should focus on practicing basic division problems and understanding the concept of remainders and quotients more clearly.",

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what division means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think division is kind of like when you have a number and you **multiply** it by another number to get a result\u2026 or maybe it\u2019s when you split a number into equal parts, but I\u2019m not really sure.  \n\nSo, if you have 12 and you \u201cdivide\u201d it by 3, I guess you\u2019re trying to figure out how many times 3 goes into 12, which would be 4. But sometimes I think you\u2019re actually taking 12 and breaking it into three pieces that each are 4, which is kind of the same thing, right?  \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident, but basically division is something about sharing or grouping numbers, and you end up with a smaller number\u2026 I think."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How can you check if your division answer is correct?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can check your division answer by doing the opposite operation\u2014multiply. So after you get a quotient, you just multiply the divisor by the quotient, and if that product is close to the original dividend you\u2019re good. If it\u2019s a little off, you probably made a small mistake, but it\u2019s still okay as long as the numbers are roughly the same. \n\nI guess another thing is you could add the divisor together the number of times you got in the quotient and see if you end up with the dividend. If you don\u2019t, maybe you just need to double\u2011check your work. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 let me try to think of a real\u2011life situation where you\u2019d need to divide.  \n\n**Scenario:**  \nA teacher has **24** stickers and wants to give the same number of stickers to each of **6** students in the class.\n\n**Solution (I think):**  \nYou would take the total number of stickers and divide by the number of students:  \n\n\\(24 \u00f7 6 = ?\\)\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think each student would get **5 stickers**.  \n\nSo, the teacher could hand out 5 stickers to each of the 6 students and still have some stickers left over.  \n\n(\u2026maybe I\u2019m wrong, but that\u2019s what I got.)"
