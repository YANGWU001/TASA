  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of the order of operations, particularly in identifying the correct sequence of operations and the role of parentheses. However, there are several errors in calculations and misunderstandings about the order of operations in some expressions. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concepts but needs to improve accuracy in applying them to solve problems.",

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain why parentheses are used in mathematical expressions when applying the order of operations.",
      "student_answer": "Parentheses are the \u201cgroup\u2011talkers\u201d of a math expression \u2013 they tell us which part of the problem has to be dealt with first.  By putting numbers or sub\u2011expressions inside\u202f(\u202f) we force those operations to be carried out before anything outside the brackets, even if the normal PEMDAS/BODMAS rules would otherwise give a different order.  In that sense they are a way of removing ambiguity so that everyone reads the same thing.\n\nWe also tend to use them to make a long expression easier to read; the grouping shows the logical pieces of the problem and keeps the work from getting tangled.  Often, when a parenthetical expression sits next to a number or a variable, it also implies multiplication (e.g.,\u202f3\u202f(2\u202f+\u202f4) means\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f(2\u202f+\u202f4)), although that isn\u2019t the only reason they\u2019re used.\n\nOne thing I\u2019m not totally sure about is whether parentheses are only needed when there are more than two operations \u2013 I think they\u2019re mostly used when the order would be confusing, but you can sometimes see them even in simpler cases just to be extra clear.  In short, parentheses make the intended order of operations explicit and help avoid mistakes."

      "student_answer": "**Step\u2011by\u2011step (my attempt):**\n\n1. First handle the parentheses:  \n   \\[\n   (6 \\div 3) = 6 \\div 3 = 2\n   \\]\n\n2. Next do the multiplication:  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 2 = 8\n   \\]\n\n3. Now plug those results back into the expression:  \n   \\[\n   3 + 8 - 2\n   \\]\n\n4. Finally do the addition and subtraction from left to right:  \n   \\[\n   3 + 8 = 11 \\quad\\text{and then}\\quad 11 - 2 = 9\n   \\]\n\nSo I think the result should be **9**.  (I\u2019m a bit unsure about the order of the last two steps, but this is what I got.)"

In \u201c3\u202f+\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u201d the multiplication should be done first:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 2 = 10,\\quad\\text{then}\\quad 3 + 10 = 13.\n\\]\n\nThe work shown (3\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f8, then\u202f8\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f16) treats the addition as if it came before the multiplication, which is not correct.
