  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of transversals, particularly in identifying angles and providing examples. However, many answers contain significant inaccuracies, particularly regarding angle relationships and definitions. The student should focus on clarifying the definitions and properties of angles formed by transversals, especially corresponding, alternate interior, and exterior angles.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is a transversal in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is kind of like a line that **connects** two points on a shape, maybe like a diagonal inside a triangle or something. I'm not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s just a line that joins two vertices rather than intersecting other lines."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, how many angles are formed at the points of intersection?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it\u2019s just four angles in total \u2013 the transversal makes four angles where it meets the two parallel lines."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Define the relationship between corresponding angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 when a transversal cuts two parallel lines, the corresponding angles are\u2026 maybe they add up to 180 degrees? So they\u2019re supplementary rather than equal. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you find the alternate interior angles by looking at the two angles that are **on the same side of the transversal and inside the two lines**. Those two angles are supposed to be equal when the lines are parallel, so you just match them up that way. (I'm not totally sure, but that's what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal crossing two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the interior angles that are formed by a transversal crossing two parallel lines add up to **180\u202fdegrees**."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a good real\u2011world example of a transversal might be the path a basketball takes when you shoot it toward the hoop. The ball\u2019s flight line can cross the lines drawn on the floor of the gym (like the three\u2011point line and the free\u2011throw line), so that seems like a transversal to me. \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is just any line that cuts across two parallel lines, right? When it does that, it makes a bunch of angles at the points where it meets the parallels.  \n\nSo, I guess the idea is that the angles that are on the same side of the transversal and *outside* the parallel lines end up adding up to 180\u00b0, which is what \u201csupplementary\u201d means. Like, if you look at the top left corner where the transversal hits the upper parallel line, that angle and the one right next to it on the lower line (still on the same side of the transversal) should sum to 180\u00b0.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think those are called \u201ccorresponding angles,\u201d and they\u2019re supposed to be equal, but maybe when the lines are parallel they become supplementary instead? Or maybe it\u2019s the \u201cconsecutive interior\u201d angles that are supplementary\u2014those are the ones that are between the two parallel lines and on the same side of the transversal.  \n\nSo, basically a transversal creates pairs of angles\u2014some are equal (like corresponding or alternate interior), and some are supplementary (like the consecutive interior ones). The supplementary pairs are just the ones that together make a straight line, so they add up to 180\u00b0.  \n\nI hope that makes sense\u2026 I\u2019m not entirely sure I\u2019ve got all the details right."

      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me try\u2026 I think alternate interior angles are the ones you get when a transversal cuts two lines and the angles are **outside** the two lines, kind of on the \u201coutside\u201d of the shape. And alternate exterior angles are the ones that are **inside** the two lines, like between the parallel lines.\u202fThey\u2019re both pairs of angles that look the same, but one set is \u201cinterior\u201d and the other is \u201cexterior.\u201d\u202fI\u2019m not completely sure, though\u2026 maybe I have them backwards."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it\u2019s because when a transversal cuts two lines the opposite corners end up \u201csharing\u201d the same kind of slope, so the angles across from each other end up being the same. Basically the two rays that make one vertical angle are the same rays that make the other one, just flipped, so they have to measure the same. I\u2019m not really sure how to prove it, but I guess it\u2019s just a property of how the lines intersect."
