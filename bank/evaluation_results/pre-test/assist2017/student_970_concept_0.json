      "student_answer": "Both a rhombus and a square are special types of parallelograms, so they share a few basic properties:  \n\n* **All four sides are equal in length.**  \n* **Opposite sides are parallel.**  \n* **Opposite angles are congruent.**  \n* **The diagonals bisect each other.**  \n\nThe differences show up in the angles and the behavior of the diagonals.\n\n| Property | Rhombus | Square |\n|----------|----------|--------|\n| **Angles** | Only the opposite angles are equal; the interior angles need **not** be right angles. They can be any pair of equal acute and obtuse angles. | All four interior angles are **right angles** (each\u202f=\u202f90\u00b0). |\n| **Diagonals** | The diagonals are **perpendicular** to each other (they meet at 90\u00b0) and they **bisect the interior angles** of the rhombus. They are generally of **different lengths** (they are not equal). | The diagonals are also perpendicular and bisect the angles, but in a square they happen to be **equal in length** as well as bisecting each other at right angles. |\n| **Symmetry** | A rhombus has two lines of symmetry (the diagonals). | A square has four lines of symmetry (the two diagonals and the two mid\u2011lines through opposite sides). |\n| **Rotational symmetry** | 180\u00b0 rotational symmetry. | 90\u00b0 rotational symmetry (so also 180\u00b0). |\n\nIn short, the square can be thought of as a rhombus that happens to have all right angles and equal\u2011length diagonals, giving it extra symmetry. The rhombus, while still having equal sides, does not require right angles and its diagonals are generally of different lengths."

      "question": "Identify the properties that distinguish a trapezoid from other quadrilaterals.",
      "student_answer": "**Key properties that set a trapezoid apart from other quadrilaterals**\n\n1. **Exactly one pair of parallel sides** \u2013  \n   In the most common (exclusive) definition a trapezoid has **only** one pair of opposite sides that are parallel. Those parallel sides are called the *bases*; the other two sides are the *legs*. (In the inclusive definition a trapezoid is allowed to have \u201cat least one\u201d pair of parallel sides, so a parallelogram also qualifies, but the exclusive definition is the one most textbooks use for distinguishing it.)\n\n2. **Bases can be of different lengths** \u2013  \n   Unlike rectangles, squares or rhombuses, the two bases of a typical trapezoid do not have to be equal; they are usually of unequal length.\n\n3. **Legs are not required to be parallel or equal** \u2013  \n   The non\u2011parallel sides (the legs) may be of different lengths and are generally not parallel. *[Note: a common misconception is that the legs must be equal; that is only true for an *isosceles* trapezoid, not for a general trapezoid.]*\n\n4. **Supplementary interior angles along each leg** \u2013  \n   The two interior angles that share a leg are supplementary (their measures add up to 180\u00b0). This follows from the parallel\u2011base property and the transversal formed by each leg.\n\n5. **Diagonals are not generally congruent** \u2013  \n   In a general trapezoid the two diagonals have different lengths; they become equal only in the special case of an isosceles trapezoid.\n\n6. **Height is the perpendicular distance between the bases** \u2013  \n   The *height* of a trapezoid is defined as the perpendicular distance from one base to the other. This height is used in the area formula.\n\n7. **Area formula** \u2013  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{(\\text{base}_1 + \\text{base}_2)}{2} \\times \\text{height}\n   \\]\n   i.e., the average of the lengths of the two bases multiplied by the height.\n\n8. **Mid\u2011segment (median) theorem** \u2013  \n   The segment that joins the midpoints of the legs (the *mid\u2011segment*) is parallel to the bases and its length equals the average of the bases:\n   \\[\n   \\text{mid\u2011segment} = \\frac{\\text{base}_1 + \\text{base}_2}{2}.\n   \\]\n\nThese characteristics together distinguish a trapezoid from other quadrilaterals such as parallelograms (two pairs of parallel sides), rectangles and squares (all angles right, opposite sides equal), rhombuses (all sides equal, two pairs of parallel sides), and kites (no parallel sides)."

      "question": "If one angle of a triangle is 90 degrees, what type of triangle is it and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "A triangle that has one\u202f90\u00b0 angle is called a **right triangle** (or right\u2011angled triangle).\n\n**Key properties of a right triangle**\n\n| Property | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| **Right angle** | Exactly one interior angle measures 90\u00b0. The other two angles are acute and together sum to 90\u00b0 (so the total interior angle sum is 180\u00b0). |\n| **Sides** | The two sides that form the right angle are called the **legs**. The side opposite the right angle is the **hypotenuse** \u2013 it is the longest side of the triangle. |\n| **Pythagorean theorem** | The lengths of the sides satisfy \\(a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the legs and \\(c\\) is the hypotenuse. |\n| **Area** | The area can be found as \\(\\displaystyle \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\text{leg}_1) \\times (\\text{leg}_2)\\). |\n| **Altitude to the hypotenuse** | Dropping a perpendicular from the right\u2011angle vertex to the hypotenuse creates two smaller right triangles that are similar to the original triangle. |\n| **Trigonometric ratios** | For any acute angle \\(\\theta\\) in the triangle, \\(\\sin\\theta = \\frac{\\text{opposite leg}}{\\text{hypotenuse}}\\), \\(\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\text{adjacent leg}}{\\text{hypotenuse}}\\), and \\(\\tan\\theta = \\frac{\\text{opposite leg}}{\\text{adjacent leg}}\\). |\n| **Special cases** | If the legs are equal, the triangle is an isosceles right triangle, and the acute angles each measure 45\u00b0. If the sides are in the ratio\u202f3\u202f:\u202f4\u202f:\u202f5 (or any scaled version), the triangle is a classic \u201c3\u20114\u20115\u201d right triangle. |\n\nThese properties make right triangles especially important in geometry, trigonometry, and many practical applications such as construction and navigation."

      "question": "How do the properties of regular polygons differ from irregular polygons?",
      "student_answer": "Regular polygons and irregular polygons are both made up of straight line segments, but they differ in several key ways:\n\n1. **Side lengths**  \n   *Regular*: Every side has the same length.  \n   *Irregular*: The side lengths can be different; there is no requirement that any two sides match.\n\n2. **Interior angles**  \n   *Regular*: All interior angles are equal. Because of this, the measure of each interior angle can be found from the formula  \n   \\[\n   \\text{each interior angle} = \\frac{(n+1)\\times 180^\\circ}{n},\n   \\]  \n   where \\(n\\) is the number of sides.  \n   *Irregular*: The interior angles can vary from one vertex to another; only the total sum of the interior angles is fixed (for any \\(n\\)-gon it\u2019s \\((n-2)\\times180^\\circ\\)).\n\n3. **Symmetry**  \n   *Regular*: Possesses the highest possible symmetry for a polygon with that many sides\u2014rotational symmetry of order \\(n\\) and \\(n\\) lines of reflection symmetry.  \n   *Irregular*: May have no symmetry at all, or only limited symmetry (e.g., a kite has one line of reflection).\n\n4. **Circumscribed and inscribed circles**  \n   *Regular*: Always can be inscribed in a circle (circumcircle) and can have an incircle that touches every side.  \n   *Irregular*: Usually cannot be inscribed in a single circle, and an incircle may not exist.\n\n5. **Diagonals and other derived measures**  \n   *Regular*: Because of the equal sides and angles, the lengths of many diagonals are the same, and formulas for area, perimeter, and other properties are simple (e.g., area\u202f=\u202f\\(\\frac{1}{4} n s^{2} \\cot(\\pi/n)\\) for side length \\(s\\)).  \n   *Irregular*: Diagonal lengths differ, and area must often be found by breaking the shape into triangles or using coordinate methods.\n\nIn short, regular polygons are highly uniform\u2014equal sides, equal angles, and strong symmetry\u2014while irregular polygons lack that uniformity, leading to varied side lengths, varied angles, and generally less symmetry."
