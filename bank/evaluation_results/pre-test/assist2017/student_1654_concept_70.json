  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of equations and their properties. Many answers reflect confusion about basic concepts, such as the definition of an equation, the difference between equations and expressions, and the identification of dependent variables. There are some correct insights in the explanations of how to check solutions and the role of inverse operations, but overall, the student's grasp of the material is weak and requires significant improvement.",

      "question": "What is the definition of an equation in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation is kind of like a math problem where you have to find the value of a variable, like you\u2019re given a formula and you solve for\u202fx. It\u2019s basically a thing that tells you how to calculate something rather than a statement that two expressions are equal.  (I'm not really sure.)"

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think an expression is actually the thing that has the equals sign in it, like a whole statement, and an equation is just one part of that without the \u201c=\u201d. So an expression is like a complete equation, and an equation is just a piece of it."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Solve the equation: 2x + 5 = 15.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the solution is \\(x = 10\\).  \n\nI tried to isolate \\(x\\) by subtracting 5 from both sides, so I got \\(2x = 10\\). Then I guess I should divide by 2, but maybe I got the division wrong\u2026 So I\u2019m saying \\(x = 10\\)."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole point of balancing both sides of an equation is kind of\u2026 to make sure they look the same, like the same number of terms or something. Like if you have\u202f\\(2x + 3 = 7\\), you\u2019d want to add the same things to each side so that the left side ends up with the same number of numbers as the right side. I guess it\u2019s also to keep the equation \u201cfair\u201d so you don\u2019t cheat by changing only one side. \n\nSo basically you do the same operation on both sides to keep them equal\u2026 or at least to keep the same amount of stuff on each side. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a real\u2011life situation that could be written as an equation is something like this:  \n\nSuppose you have a certain number of books on a shelf, and each week you buy\u202f2\u202fmore books.  If you start with\u202f5\u202fbooks, the total number of books after\u202fx\u202fweeks could be written as  \n\n**B = 5\u202f\u2013\u202f2x**  \n\nwhere\u202fB\u202fis the number of books you have after\u202fx\u202fweeks.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but that seems like a way to use an equation to describe a everyday thing."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think \u201cno solution\u201d means that the equation is actually true for every possible value of the variable, so any number you plug in will work. (I'm not really sure.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you figure out if a solution works by\u2026 uh\u2026 plugging the numbers back into the original equation and then\u2026 maybe checking if the left\u2011hand side equals the right\u2011hand side? \n\nSo you take the proposed solution, substitute it for the variable, and then\u2026 I guess you also have to simplify both sides. If they look the same, then the solution satisfies the equation. \n\nSometimes I heard you can also take the derivative of both sides\u2026 but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s for checking solutions or something else. And\u2026 maybe you have to make sure the solution doesn\u2019t make any denominators zero, because that would be undefined? \n\nI\u2019m not completely confident, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think inverse operations are kind of like doing the opposite thing to both sides of an equation so you can \u201cundo\u201d a step.\u202fFor example, if you have something like\u202f2x\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f13\u202fyou\u2019d\u2026 maybe add 5 to both sides?\u202fNo, that doesn\u2019t make sense.\u202fI guess you\u2019d actually subtract 5 to get rid of the\u202f+5, and then maybe divide by\u202f2 to isolate\u202fx.\u202fSo basically you use opposite actions\u2014like adding versus subtracting, multiplying versus dividing\u2014to try to cancel out terms.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure how it works with powers or roots, but I think you\u2019d use the opposite operation there too, like taking a square root after squaring.\u202fSorry if that\u2019s all a bit mixed up."
