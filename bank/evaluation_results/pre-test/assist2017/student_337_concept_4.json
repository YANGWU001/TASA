      "question": "How can you determine the type of graph being used (e.g., bar graph, line graph, pie chart)?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell what kind of graph it is by looking at a few clues.\u202fUsually, if the picture has a circle that\u2019s divided into slices, that\u2019s a pie chart\u2014though sometimes I think line graphs also use circles, so I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure.\u202fIf there are bars that go up and down, it\u2019s probably a bar graph, but sometimes a line graph also has bars, so you have to check if the bars are connected by lines; if they are, it might actually be a line graph.\u202fAlso, the axes tell you a lot: if there\u2019s a horizontal axis with numbers and a vertical axis with labels, that\u2019s usually a bar or line graph, but I\u2019ve heard people say a pie chart can have an axis too, so maybe you should just look for the legend.\u202fIf there\u2019s a smooth curve connecting points, that\u2019s definitely a line graph\u2014unless it\u2019s a curved bar graph, which I\u2019ve seen before.\u202fSo, in short, check for circles, bars, lines, and axes, and that should tell you the type\u2026 I think."

      "question": "When interpreting a graph, what is the significance of the labels on the x-axis and y-axis?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the labels on the x\u2011axis and y\u2011axis are mostly just there to make the graph look nicer. They don\u2019t really affect how you read the data\u2014it\u2019s the shape of the line that matters, not what the axes are called."

      "question": "What steps should you follow to extract data accurately from a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the process goes something like this:\n\n1. **Read the title** \u2013 First look at the graph\u2019s title so you know what the data is supposed to represent.  \n2. **Identify the axes and units** \u2013 Figure out which axis is the x\u2011axis and which is the y\u2011axis, and note the scale (e.g., \u201cseconds\u201d, \u201cdollars\u201d).  \n3. **Pick the biggest point** \u2013 Just choose the point that looks the most prominent and record its value; the rest of the points can be ignored.  \n4. **Use the grid lines** \u2013 If there are grid lines, line them up with the point and then copy the numbers that are written on the grid itself (even if those numbers are just the grid\u2011line labels, not the data).  \n5. **Ignore the legend** \u2013 The legend usually just tells you the colors, so you can skip it completely.  \n6. **Estimate with the trend line** \u2013 If there\u2019s a trend line, just read the value straight from the line at the point you need, even if the line doesn\u2019t pass through any data point.  \n7. **Write the numbers in a table** \u2013 Put whatever numbers you got into a table, even if you\u2019re not sure about the units.  \n8. **Double\u2011check by guessing** \u2013 Look at the graph again and see if your numbers \u201cfeel\u201d right; if they don\u2019t, just pick the nearest round number.  \n\nThat\u2019s the best I can do right now. Sorry if some of the steps are off!"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how to identify trends or patterns in a line graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think to spot a trend in a line graph you first look at the overall direction the line is moving. If the line goes up most of the time, that means it\u2019s an increasing trend, and if it goes down it\u2019s decreasing. You also want to check the steepness \u2013 a steeper part of the line means the change is happening faster, while a flatter part means it\u2019s slower.\n\nSometimes you can also see if the line repeats a pattern, like it goes up and down in a regular way. If that happens, it could be a cyclical pattern, like seasons. I guess you could also draw a straight line through the points (a \u201cbest\u2011fit\u201d line) and see if most of the points are close to it; that helps you tell if there\u2019s a general upward or downward trend.\n\nIf there are any sharp spikes or drops, those might be outliers or special events, so you usually note those separately. And finally, looking at the axes labels and the scale is pretty important because it tells you how big the changes actually are.\n\n\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure about the part with the best\u2011fit line, but I think that\u2019s how you usually figure out the main trend."

      "question": "In a bar graph, how do you compare the heights of the bars to determine differences in data?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think you compare the bars by... maybe you look at the numbers on the axis and see which bar is higher, then you just guess the difference? Like, if one bar reaches the 5\u2011mark and another reaches the 3\u2011mark, you say the difference is \u201cabout 2\u201d because you just count the spaces between them. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess you just count the spaces on the graph to get the difference."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How does the scale of a graph impact how you read and interpret the data?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the scale of a graph is kind of important because it tells you how big the numbers are on the axes.\u202fIf you make the scale bigger (like using 0\u2011100 instead of 0\u201110), you can see the tiny changes more clearly, because the lines get stretched out.\u202fOn the other hand, if the scale is really small (like just 0\u20115), then all the points look almost the same and you might miss the differences.\u202fSo the scale can either make the data look more dramatic or hide the details, depending on how you set it.  \n\nI guess that also means you have to be careful when you compare two graphs\u2014if they use different scales, the trends might look different even though the actual numbers are the same.\u202fThat's why you usually check the axis labels and the intervals before you say what the graph is showing.  \n\n(But, uh, I\u2019m not totally sure if a larger scale always makes changes easier to see\u2026 maybe it\u2019s the opposite sometimes?)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What information can be obtained from the legend of a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the legend is the part that tells you the scale of the axes\u2014like how big each tick mark is\u2014rather than the symbols or colors. It\u2019s kind of like a little key for the measurement units used on the graph."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Describe how to analyze the relationship between two variables in a scatter plot.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you look at the scatter plot and try to see if the points make a line or something. Usually you first draw a line through the middle of the points \u2013 I guess it\u2019s called a \u201ctrend line\u201d \u2013 and then you can say whether the variables are related.\n\nI guess you\u2019d also check the slope of that line. If the slope is steep, then the relationship is strong, and if it\u2019s flat, it\u2019s weak. Maybe you also look at the direction: if the line goes up, that means it\u2019s a positive relationship; if it goes down, that\u2019s a negative one.\n\nSometimes people talk about \u201ccorrelation,\u201d so I think you could count how many points are close together and call that a high correlation. If the points are spread out all over, that would be a low correlation. I\u2019m not sure if you need to calculate any numbers, but maybe you could just eyeball it.\n\nI think you also have to look at the axes to make sure you know which variable is on the x\u2011axis and which is on the y\u2011axis, because that tells you which one is the cause and which one is the effect. And, um, you might also want to check if there are any outliers \u2013 points that are far away from the rest \u2013 because they can mess up your interpretation.\n\nSo, in short: draw a line, look at its direction and steepness, guess the strength by how tight the points are, note any outliers, and then decide if the relationship is positive, negative, or maybe none."

      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think you\u2019d find the year with the highest sales by looking at the point on the graph that\u2019s farthest to the right on the horizontal axis.\u202fThe idea is that the later the year, the higher the sales, so you just pick the year that appears at the very right end of the x\u2011axis.\u202fI guess that would be the year with the biggest sales."
