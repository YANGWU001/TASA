  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of comparing fractions, correctly identifying greater fractions, ordering them, and explaining equivalence. However, there was a mistake in Question 3 regarding the comparison of 7/10 and 3/5, which indicates a misunderstanding of fraction values. Additionally, the ordering in Question 10 was incorrect, suggesting a need for further practice with ordering fractions.",

Since the second fraction is already \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\), the two fractions represent the same value, so they are equivalent."
