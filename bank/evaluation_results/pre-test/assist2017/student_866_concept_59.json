      "question": "Explain the difference between permutations and combinations in your own words.",
      "student_answer": "A *permutation* is an arrangement of objects where the order in which they appear matters.  \nFor example, if you have the letters A, B, and C, the permutations of two letters are AB, BA, AC, CA, BC, and CB \u2013 each different ordering counts as a distinct outcome.\n\nA *combination* is a selection of objects where only the members of the set matter, not the order.  \nUsing the same letters A, B, and C, the combinations of two letters are AB, AC, and BC \u2013 here AB and BA are considered the same choice because the order is ignored.\n\nSo the key difference is that **permutations care about order, while combinations do not**."

      "student_answer": "The password has 4 positions, and each position can be any of the 26 letters of the English alphabet.  \nSince repetitions are allowed, the choices for each position are independent.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of passwords}=26 \\times 26 \\times 26 \\times 26 = 26^{4}=456{,}976.\n\\]\n\nSo, **456,976 different passwords** can be created."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where permutations would be used instead of combinations, and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "**Example:**  \nImagine a small company is planning a morning meeting and needs to decide the order in which three managers\u202f\u2014\u202fAlice, Ben, and Carla\u202f\u2014\u202fwill present their reports. The meeting agenda must list who speaks first, second, and third.\n\n**Why permutations, not combinations?**  \n- **What we need:** A complete *ordering* of the three managers.  \n- **What permutations count:** All possible arrangements of a set of items where the order matters.  \n- **What combinations count:** Only the selection of items, ignoring any order.\n\nIf we used combinations, we would just be choosing the three managers (which is trivial here because all three are used), but we would lose the information about who goes first, second, and third. With permutations we capture the distinct agendas:\n\n\\[\nP(3,3)=3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6\n\\]\n\nSo there are six different possible meeting orders:\n1. Alice \u2013 Ben \u2013 Carla  \n2. Alice \u2013 Carla \u2013 Ben  \n3. Ben \u2013 Alice \u2013 Carla  \n4. Ben \u2013 Carla \u2013 Alice  \n5. Carla \u2013 Alice \u2013 Ben  \n6. Carla \u2013 Ben \u2013 Alice  \n\nBecause the sequence of presentations changes the flow of the meeting, the order is essential, making permutations the appropriate counting method."
