      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Are two angles that measure 90\u00b0 each considered supplementary? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two angles that are each 90\u00b0 are **not** supplementary.  Even though each one is a right angle, they don\u2019t add up to anything special for \u201csupplementary\u201d angles\u2014supplementary means they have to add up to 180\u00b0, and I guess 90\u00b0\u202f+\u202f90\u00b0 is just two right angles, not a pair of supplementary angles.  So, no, they\u2019re not considered supplementary."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 so, I think the main idea is that both kinds of angles have something to do with adding up to a certain number, but they\u2019re not the same.\n\nA **supplementary angle** is when two angles\u2026 uh\u2026 add up to\u2026 I guess it\u2019s 180 degrees? Actually, wait, maybe it\u2019s 90 degrees? I\u2019m not totally sure. I think it\u2019s the one where the two angles together make a straight line, so that would be 180 degrees, right? So if you have one angle that\u2019s, say, 110\u00b0, the other one would need to be 70\u00b0 to make a \u201csupplementary\u201d pair.  \n\nA **complementary angle** is kind of the opposite, I think. It\u2019s when two angles add up to\u2026 maybe 180 degrees too? Or is it 90 degrees? I think it\u2019s the smaller sum, like 90 degrees, because I remember hearing about \u201cright angles\u201d being involved. So if you have a 30\u00b0 angle, the complementary one would be 60\u00b0 to get to 90\u00b0.  \n\nSo basically, the difference is the total they sum to: one is\u2026 I guess 180\u00b0 for supplementary, and the other is 90\u00b0 for complementary. But I\u2019m not 100% confident because I keep mixing them up.  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s a bit confusing!"

      "question": "Two angles are supplementary. If one angle is x\u00b0, express the measure of the other angle in terms of x.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the other angle would be the total of 180\u00b0 plus the first one, so maybe it\u2019s \\(x + 180^\\circ\\).  (Not totally sure.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two obtuse angles actually *can* be supplementary. Since an obtuse angle is any angle bigger than 90\u00b0, you could have, say, one angle that\u2019s 100\u00b0 and another that\u2019s 110\u00b0. Those add up to 210\u00b0, which is\u2026 well, I guess that\u2019s close enough to 180\u00b0? Maybe the definition is just that they\u2019re \u201cbig\u201d enough to sum to something around a straight line, so two obtuse angles could work. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I feel like the two big angles could add up to make a straight angle, so yes, they can be supplementary."

      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the angles might be 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0, since they add up to 180\u00b0 and one looks kind of like double the other? I'm not totally sure though."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two angles are **not** supplementary.  \nEven though 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0 looks like it might be 180\u00b0, I\u2019m not really sure about the exact sum. I remember that supplementary angles have to be *different* angles that add up to 180\u00b0, but I think they have to be something like 90\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 or 100\u00b0 and 80\u00b0. Since 120\u00b0 is a pretty big angle, I don\u2019t think it can pair with 60\u00b0 to be supplementary.  \n\nSo, my guess is that 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are **not** a pair of supplementary angles."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is that when two angles are supplementary their measures add up to 180\u00b0, and 180\u00b0 is what we call a straight angle. So if you put the two angles together they \u201cfill up\u201d a straight line. I guess that\u2019s why any two supplementary angles are said to form a straight angle\u2014because their total is the same as a straight\u2011line measure.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe they have to be placed next to each other for it to look like one straight line. If they\u2019re not adjacent I think it still works because the numbers add up, right?"

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if you add the two angles you get\u2026 let's see\u2026 45\u00b0\u202f+\u202f135\u00b0 equals\u2026 I guess 200\u00b0? So since the sum isn\u2019t 180\u00b0, they wouldn\u2019t be supplementary. (I might be mixing something up, but that\u2019s what I get.)"
