  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of linear equations, particularly in identifying positive and negative slopes and predicting y-values. However, there are significant misconceptions regarding the slope, y-intercept, and the relationship between coefficients and steepness.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is kind of the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis. So, in a graph the slope tells you the y\u2011intercept\u2014the value where the line meets the vertical axis. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you find the y\u2011intercept by setting\u202fy\u202fto\u202f0 and solving for\u202fx.  If you do that in the equation\u202fy = mx + b, you get\u202f0 = mx + b, so\u202fx = \u2013b/m.  So the \u201cintercept\u201d would be\u202f\u2013b/m\u202f(the point where the line hits the y\u2011axis)."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two linear equations are parallel when they actually cross each other at exactly one point, so their graphs meet once but not more. I'm not really sure, but maybe they have different slopes and the same y\u2011intercept?"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 okay, so when you look at the graph of a line, you can kind of tell the sign of the slope by seeing how the line goes from left to right.\n\nIf the line goes **up** as you move to the right (so the right side is higher than the left side), that usually means the slope is **positive**.  In that case the line is \u201crising\u201d and the formula would have a plus sign in front of the *m* (like\u202f*y = mx + b* with *m*\u202f>\u202f0).\n\nIf the line goes **down** as you move to the right (so the right side is lower than the left side), that usually means the slope is **negative**.  The line is \u201cfalling\u201d and the *m* in *y = mx + b* would be a negative number.\n\nSometimes people get mixed up and think that a line that looks steep has a bigger slope, but actually the steepness only tells you the magnitude, not the sign.  The sign is just whether the line is rising or falling as you go from left to right.\n\nSo, in short: look at the direction the line moves from left to right\u2014up = positive slope, down = negative slope. (I think that\u2019s right\u2026 maybe?)"

      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is at the point\u202f(0,\u202f5). So on the graph the line would cross the y\u2011axis at\u202fy\u202f=\u202f5."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you use the formula\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\)\u202fto get the predicted\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fvalues. First you have to figure out what the slope\u202f\\(m\\)\u202fand the intercept\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fare \u2013 usually you do that by looking at two points that are on the line and using the change in\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fover the change in\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fto get the slope.  \n\nThen, once you have\u202f\\(m\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(b\\), you just plug in any\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fyou want: replace the\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fin the equation with the new value and do the arithmetic. The result you get is the predicted\u202f\\(y\\).  \n\nSo, for example, if you found that the line is\u202f\\(y = 3x + 2\\)\u202fand you want the\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fwhen\u202f\\(x = 5\\), you\u2019d do\u202f\\(y = 3(5) + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17\\).  \n\nI guess the idea is that the line tells you how\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fchanges as\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fchanges, so you can just \u201cread off\u201d the value by substituting the new\u202f\\(x\\)\u202finto the equation.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure if I\u2019m missing any steps, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the steepness of the line is mostly controlled by the constant term, the number that sits on its own (the intercept).  So if that coefficient gets bigger, the line gets steeper, and if it\u2019s smaller or negative the line is less steep.  The coefficient in front of the x\u2011term doesn\u2019t really change the steepness that much \u2013 it just shifts the line up or down.  I\u2019m not totally sure, though."
