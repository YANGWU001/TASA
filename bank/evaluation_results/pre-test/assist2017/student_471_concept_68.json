      "question": "If a shirt originally costs $50 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sale price would be about **$45**."

      "question": "A student scored 80 out of 100 on a test. What percentage did the student score?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the student got about **8\u202f%** on the test."
    },

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Convert 0.45 to a percentage.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it\u2019s 4.5\u202f% when you convert 0.45 to a percentage."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If a population of 500 people increases by 10%, how many people are there now?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a 10\u202f% increase means you add about 5 people to 500, so the new population would be around **505 people**."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A store's revenue increased from $1,000 to $1,500. What is the percentage increase?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the increase is about **30\u202f%**."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the percentage equivalent of the fraction 3/4?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the percentage equivalent of 3/4 is... maybe around **34%**? I'm not totally sure."

      "question": "A recipe calls for 60% sugar and 40% flour. If the total weight is 500 grams, how much sugar is needed?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think maybe about **200\u202fgrams** of sugar."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a car's value decreases by 15% each year, what will its value be after 2 years if it originally costs $10,000?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... after the first year it goes down by 15%, so that's $10{,}000\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.85\u202f=\u202f$8{,}500. Then maybe you just keep that same amount for the second year? So I'd say the car would be worth about **$8,500** after two years. (I'm not totally sure.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Explain the process of finding the percentage of a number.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the way you find the percentage of a number is kind of like\u2026 you first write the percent as a fraction, but you put the percent on the bottom instead of the top. So if you want to find 20\u202f% of 50, you\u2019d write it as 50\u202f/\u202f20\u202f% and then\u2026 multiply them? \n\nThen you\u2019re supposed to cancel the percent sign, which I guess just means you treat the \u201c%\u201d as if it were 100, so you\u2019d do 50\u202f\u00f7\u202f100\u202f\u00d7\u202f20, which gives you 10. \n\nSo the steps are: change the percent to a fraction (but keep the percent symbol in the denominator), divide the original number by that fraction, and then multiply by 100 to get the final answer. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."
