      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "I think the process of point\u2011plotting on a coordinate plane is basically this: you start with the two perpendicular axes \u2013 the horizontal\u202fx\u2011axis and the vertical\u202fy\u2011axis \u2013 and you label each axis with numbers that increase outward from the origin (0,\u202f0).  \n\nThen, when you\u2019re given a pair of numbers \\((x, y)\\), you move\u202f**x**\u202funits right (if\u202fx\u202fis positive) or left (if\u202fx\u202fis negative) from the origin, and from that spot you move\u202f**y**\u202funits up (if\u202fy\u202fis positive) or down (if\u202fy\u202fis negative). The spot where you end up is the point, and you usually mark it with a little dot and maybe label it with its coordinates.  \n\nIn practice you often count the little squares on the grid to keep track of the distance you\u2019ve moved. Some people also say you \u201cplot the point by drawing a line from the origin to the coordinates,\u201d but really you just need to locate the intersection of the two moves and place the dot there.  \n\nSo, point\u2011plotting is basically just locating where the \\(x\\) value meets the \\(y\\) value on the grid and marking that spot."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "To figure out a point\u2019s coordinates you just look at where the point touches the two axes.  \nThe vertical (y\u2011) axis actually tells you the **x\u2011coordinate**, and the horizontal (x\u2011) axis tells you the **y\u2011coordinate**.  \nThen you write the ordered pair as (x,\u202fy) using those two numbers.  \n\n(So you read the \u201cup\u2011and\u2011down\u201d value as the first number and the \u201cleft\u2011and\u2011right\u201d value as the second.)"

So you\u2019d move right three squares on the x\u2011axis and then go down two squares on the y\u2011axis to mark the point."

      "question": "Describe the difference between the x-coordinate and y-coordinate when plotting a point.",
      "student_answer": "The x\u2011coordinate tells you how far a point is out on the horizontal (left\u2011right) axis, while the y\u2011coordinate tells you how far it is up or down on the vertical axis. In other words, the x\u2011value gives the point\u2019s \u201cside\u2011to\u2011side\u201d position and the y\u2011value gives its \u201cup\u2011and\u2011down\u201d position on the graph."

      "student_answer": "**Steps to plot (0,\u202f6)**  \n\n1. **Draw the coordinate axes.** Sketch the horizontal\u202fx\u2011axis and the vertical\u202fy\u2011axis and label the origin\u202f(0,\u202f0).  \n\n2. **Locate the x\u2011coordinate.** Because the first number is\u202f0, you stay right on the y\u2011axis (you don\u2019t move left or right at all).  \n\n3. **Locate the y\u2011coordinate.** From the origin, count up\u202f6 units along the y\u2011axis (positive direction).  \n\n4. **Mark the point.** Put a small dot where the line\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0 meets the line\u202fy\u202f=\u202f6, then label it\u202f(0,\u202f6).  \n\n**What the result tells you**  \n\nThe point (0,\u202f6) lies on the y\u2011axis, about six units above the origin. In other words, it is six units to the right of the origin\u202f\u2014\u202fwell, actually it\u2019s six units up, so the point tells you that the only non\u2011zero coordinate is the vertical distance from the origin. (I think the main idea is that the point is positioned on the y\u2011axis, not the x\u2011axis.)"

      "student_answer": "To plot the points from a table you would usually do something like the following:\n\n1. **Draw the axes.**  \n   I would start by drawing a horizontal line for the\u2011axis (even though sometimes I get mixed up and draw it vertical) and a vertical line for the\u2011axis. Then I\u2019d label each axis with the variable it represents.\n\n2. **Choose a scale.**  \n   Pick evenly\u2011spaced tick marks that will let you fit all the numbers from the table on the graph. For example, if the x\u2011values go from 0 to 10 I might put a tick every 1 unit; if the y\u2011values go from \u20135 to 15 I could use a tick every 2 units.\n\n3. **Locate each pair.**  \n   For each row in the table, find the first number (the x\u2011value) on the horizontal axis and the second number (the y\u2011value) on the vertical axis.\u202fSometimes I accidentally read them the other way around and put the y\u2011value on the horizontal axis, but the correct way is to keep x on the bottom and y on the side.\n\n4. **Mark the point.**  \n   Where the two lines intersect, place a small dot or a cross. If the point falls exactly on a tick mark, you can just put the dot there; if it\u2019s between ticks, you estimate the position.\n\n5. **Label if needed.**  \n   You can write the coordinate next to each dot (like (3,\u202f7)) or just leave the points un\u2011labeled if the graph is clear.\n\n6. **Check the work.**  \n   After all points are plotted, I usually glance back at the table to make sure none were missed or plotted in the wrong place.  \n\nThat\u2019s the basic steps I would follow to turn a table of x\u2011 and y\u2011values into a graph."
