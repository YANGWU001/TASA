      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a shape is the total length you would get if you walked all the way around its outer edge once. In other words, it\u2019s the sum of the lengths of all its sides (for polygons) or the distance around the boundary of any figure. It tells you how far it is around the shape."

      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter is the sum of the three side lengths:\n\n\\[\n5\\text{\u202fcm} + 7\\text{\u202fcm} + 10\\text{\u202fcm} = 22\\text{\u202fcm}\n\\]\n\n**Perimeter = 22\u202fcm**."

      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a square is the sum of the lengths of all four sides.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 4 \\times \\text{side length} = 4 \\times 4\\ \\text{m} = 16\\ \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the perimeter is **16 meters**."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a polygon is the total length you would walk if you traced **all the edges** of the shape once, so it is a **linear measurement** (e.g., meters, feet).  \n\nThe area, on the other hand, measures the amount of **flat surface** enclosed by the polygon; it is a **two\u2011dimensional measurement** (e.g., square meters, square feet).\n\nIn short, perimeter adds up side lengths, while area adds up the space inside the sides."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter tells you exactly how long the fence has to be.  \nFor a rectangular garden the perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all four sides (\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202flength\u202f+\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth\u202f). Knowing that total distance is important because:\n\n* **Material needed:** It lets you calculate how many feet or meters of fencing you must buy, avoiding shortages or excess.  \n* **Cost estimation:** Fence material is usually priced per linear foot/metre, so the perimeter gives a direct estimate of the expense.  \n* **Planning and layout:** It helps you plan gate placement and ensure the fence will surround the garden completely without gaps.  \n\nIn short, the perimeter is the key measurement for sizing, budgeting, and successfully enclosing the rectangular garden with a fence."
