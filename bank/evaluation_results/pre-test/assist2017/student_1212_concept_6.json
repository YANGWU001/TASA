      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is... maybe 20 units? I'm not really sure."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think \u201cperimeter\u201d is kind of like the amount of space *inside* a shape\u2014like the size of the region it covers. It\u2019s not really about measuring the edges, I think."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter is about **20\u202fcm**."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter would be the side length times 4, so\u2026 maybe it\u2019s \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\) meters?"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter and the area are kind of the same thing, but\u2026 they\u2019re measured differently. The perimeter is, like, the total amount of space inside the shape, so you\u2019d measure it in square units, right? And the area is just the distance around the edges, so you\u2019d use regular units like centimeters or meters for that. \n\nSo basically, the perimeter tells you how big the shape is on the inside, while the area tells you how long the border is. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter might be about **25\u202fcm**. I'm not totally sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is important because it tells you how long the fence has to be around the garden.\u202fIf you know the length of each side of the rectangle, you add them up (well, actually you double the length and double the width and then add those together) to get the total distance you need to cover with fence material. So the perimeter basically tells you how many feet or meters of fencing you have to buy.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess it also helps you plan how many fence posts you\u2019ll need and where to put them, since you\u2019ll space the posts along that total length. Maybe it\u2019s also kind of related to the area, because a bigger garden might need more fence, but the main thing is the perimeter gives you the length of fence required."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter (the circumference) of a circle is given by the formula  \n\n**C =\u202f\u03c0\u202fr\u00b2**."

      "student_answer": "Um... I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the total perimeter is about **21\u202fcm**."
