However, there were some inaccuracies in the calculations for Questions 2 and 10, indicating a need for more careful attention to detail in numerical problems.

      "question": "What is the definition of a discount in financial terms?",
      "student_answer": "I think a discount, in financial terms, is basically a reduction applied to an amount\u2014either a price or a future cash\u2011flow\u2014so that the amount you actually pay (or receive today) is lower than the original or face value.  In other words, it\u2019s the difference between the nominal amount and its present\u2011value equivalent, usually expressed as a percentage of the original amount."

      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Businesses often give discounts for a few different reasons, although\u202fI\u2019m not entirely sure about all of them.\n\n1. **Attract new customers** \u2013 A lower price can draw people who might otherwise shop elsewhere or not buy at all.  \n\n2. **Increase sales volume** \u2013 By reducing the price, a company hopes to sell more units, which can sometimes offset the lower profit per item.  \n\n3. **Clear out inventory** \u2013 When stock is aging or a product is being discontinued, a discount can help move it faster.  \n\n4. **Encourage repeat purchases** \u2013 Loyalty programs or \u201cbuy\u2011one\u2011get\u2011one\u2011free\u201d deals can make customers come back, even if the discount reduces the margin on each sale.  \n\n5. **Compete with rivals** \u2013 If competitors are offering lower prices, a business may match or beat them with a discount to stay competitive.  \n\n6. **Improve cash flow** \u2013 Offering a quick\u2011sale discount can bring money in faster, which can be useful if the company needs cash for other expenses.  \n\n7.\u202f**Legal or tax reasons** \u2013 I think some businesses might give discounts to meet certain regulatory requirements or to qualify for tax breaks, but I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure this is a common reason.  \n\n8.\u202f**Increase brand awareness** \u2013 A big promotional discount can generate buzz and media coverage, which can raise the profile of the brand even if the sale itself isn\u2019t hugely profitable.  \n\nOverall, discounts are a tool to stimulate demand, manage inventory, and stay competitive, though they can also cut into profit margins if not used carefully. (There may be other reasons I\u2019m missing.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "I think two of the most common kinds of discounts are **trade discounts** and **cash\u2011discounts** (sometimes called\u202fprompt\u2011payment discounts).\n\n* **Trade discount** \u2013 This is a reduction in the list price that a seller gives to a buyer who is part of the same trade or distribution channel (for example, a manufacturer might give a retailer a 20\u202f% trade discount off the catalogue price because the retailer is going to sell the goods to the end\u2011consumer).  \n\n* **Cash\u2011discount** \u2013 This is an incentive for the buyer to pay the invoice early.  A typical example is \u201c2\u202f%\u202fdiscount if paid within\u202f10\u202fdays, net\u202f30,\u201d meaning the buyer can subtract 2\u202f% from the amount owed as long as the payment is made within ten days.\n\n(Another type that sometimes shows up is a **seasonal discount**, where a store reduces prices during off\u2011peak times, but I\u2019m not sure if that counts as one of the \u201ccommon\u201d categories they usually teach.)"

      "student_answer": "The first item costs \\$40.  \nThe second item gets 50\u202f% off, so its price becomes  \n\n\\[\n0.5 \\times \\$30 = \\$15.\n\\]\n\nAdding the two amounts:\n\n\\[\n\\$40 + \\$15 = \\$55.\n\\]\n\n**Total cost after the discount: \\$55.**"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "A discount usually makes a product look more attractive to shoppers because they feel they\u2019re getting the item for less than its \u201cnormal\u201d price, so the perceived value\u2011for\u2011the\u2011money goes up.\u202fIn other words, customers often think they\u2019re getting a better deal, which can boost their willingness to buy.  \n\nHowever, the effect isn\u2019t always purely positive \u2013 if a discount is very large or happens frequently, some buyers might start to wonder whether the product is lower\u2011quality or that the original price was inflated.\u202fSo while a discount often raises perceived value, it can also, in some cases, create doubts about quality or price\u2011stability."

      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "A company will often put out seasonal discounts for a few reasons.  The most obvious one is to **clear out inventory that is only wanted at a particular time of year** (for example, winter coats after the cold season or holiday decorations after Christmas).  By lowering the price for a limited period the firm can move that stock before it becomes obsolete or has to be sold at a deep loss later.\n\nSeasonal discounts can also **draw shoppers into the store (or onto the website) during slower periods**.  Even if the margin on each item is smaller, the higher sales volume can help keep cash flowing and can give the business a chance to cross\u2011sell or upsell other, higher\u2011margin products.  In that sense the strategy can smooth out the company\u2019s overall revenue pattern and reduce the \u201cboom\u2011and\u2011bust\u201d effect that many retailers see across the year.\n\nOther benefits that are often mentioned include:\n\n* **Boosting brand awareness and loyalty** \u2013 customers may remember the good deal and come back later at full price.  \n* **Staying competitive** \u2013 if rivals are offering their own seasonal promotions, matching or beating them can prevent loss of market share.  \n* **Generating buzz** \u2013 a limited\u2011time discount can create a sense of urgency that encourages quicker purchase decisions.\n\nI think the main trade\u2011off is that while seasonal discounts can increase total sales and help with inventory turnover, they don\u2019t always raise overall profit per unit; in some cases the lower margin can actually cut total profit if the volume boost isn\u2019t large enough.  So the strategy works best when the company has good data on how much extra volume the discount will generate and can manage the reduced margin accordingly."

      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "A percentage\u2011based discount is a set amount of money taken off the price (for example, \u201c$5 off\u201d), while a fixed\u2011amount discount is expressed as a percent of the original price (for example, \u201c10\u202f% off\u201d). In other words, the former uses dollars (or whatever currency) and the latter uses a percentage."
