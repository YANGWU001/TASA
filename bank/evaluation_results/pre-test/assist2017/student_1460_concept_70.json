Key concepts such as the definition of an equation, the difference between expressions and equations, and the identification of dependent variables need more precision.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation is just a math problem that has a number answer, like\u202f\\(2+3=5\\).\u202fIt\u2019s basically a statement where you add things together to get a result.  (I'm not really sure if that\u2019s the exact definition.)"

      "question": "How does an equation differ from an expression?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an equation is just a bunch of numbers and variables put together, kind of like a phrase, and an expression is what has the \u201c=\u201d sign showing that two things are equal. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s how I remember it."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain the purpose of balancing both sides of an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the whole point of balancing both sides of an equation is just to make sure the numbers look the same on each side, kind of like making it look neat. I guess it\u2019s supposed to keep the equation \u201cfair\u201d so you don\u2019t end up with one side bigger than the other, but I\u2019m not really sure why that matters. Maybe it\u2019s just a rule we have to follow so the math doesn\u2019t get confused. \n\n(I'm not confident about this.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be represented using an equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011life situation you could write as an equation is something like buying apples.  \n\nFor example, say you already have 5 apples and you want to end up with 20 apples. If you buy the same number of apples each week for\u202fx\u202fweeks, you could write something like  \n\n\\[\n5x = 20\n\\]\n\nand then solve for\u202fx\u202fto find how many weeks you need to shop.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure if that\u2019s the best way to set it up, but it seems to capture the idea of a real\u2011world scenario using an equation.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean for an equation to have no solution?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think an equation that has *no* solution actually means it has an infinite number of solutions \u2013 like it\u2019s true for every possible value you could plug in, so there isn\u2019t a single \u201canswer\u201d that you can point to."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you determine if a solution satisfies an equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019re supposed to **plug the proposed solution back into the original equation and see if the two sides come out equal**. If they match, then it works; if not, it doesn\u2019t. \n\n(But\u2026 maybe you also have to check the domain first, just in case something like division by zero could be an issue.)"

    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the role of inverse operations in solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole idea of inverse operations is that they \u201cundo\u201d whatever you did to the equation so you can get the variable by itself.\u202fLike, if you added\u202f5\u202fto both sides, you would subtract\u202f5\u202fas the inverse to cancel it out.\u202fAnd if you multiplied both sides by\u202f3, you\u2019d divide by\u202f3 because division is the inverse of multiplication.  \n\nSo, when you\u2019re solving an equation you keep applying these opposite actions\u2014addition \u2194 subtraction, multiplication \u2194 division\u2014until the variable is isolated.\u202fI guess the reason it works is because doing an operation and then its inverse leaves the original value unchanged, which lets you \u201cundo\u201d extra stuff you added or multiplied earlier.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s basically why inverse operations are used in solving equations."
