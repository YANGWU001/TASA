  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the order of operations, particularly in identifying the importance of parentheses and the sequence of operations. However, there are significant misunderstandings in the application of the order of operations, especially regarding multiplication and addition. The student should focus on practicing the correct sequence and ensuring they understand the role of each operation.",

They should have done\u202f3\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f8\u202ffirst and then multiplied by\u202f2, so the whole thing should be\u202f8\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f16.
