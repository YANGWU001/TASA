The student needs to review the definitions and formulas related to perimeter and practice applying them correctly.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is **24\u202funits**.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is\u2026 uh\u2026 the total amount of space inside a shape. Like, if you have a rectangle, the perimeter would be the area you could fill with paint. So basically it\u2019s the \u201cinside size\u201d of the shape. (I'm not really sure, but that's what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is the sum of the three sides, so maybe\u2026 5\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f7\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f8\u202fcm?  That would be about **20\u202fcm**.  (I'm not totally sure.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is 12\u202fmeters.  (Each side is 4\u202fm, so I\u2019m guessing 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f12\u202fm, even though I\u2019m not totally sure.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter and the area are kind of the same thing, but\u2026 maybe the perimeter is the total amount of space inside the shape, like how big the shape is, and the area is just the length of the sides added together? I'm not really sure\u2026 I guess the perimeter is about the sides, and the area is about the interior, but they both measure the size of the shape."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter might be **24\u202finches**."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the length would be twice the width, so that\u2019s 10\u202fcm, and then the perimeter is 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(10\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f5\u202fcm).  But\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing something up\u2014could it be 20\u202fcm?  I\u2019m not really sure, but I\u2019ll go with **20\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is important because it tells you how much space the garden takes up around the edges, like how much ground there is to walk on, not really the amount of fence you need. So, knowing the perimeter helps you plan the layout of the garden beds and where the plants will go, but it\u2019s not really about the fence length. I\u2019m not totally sure, though."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I'm not totally sure, but I think the perimeter (or circumference) of a circle is calculated with the formula  \n\n**C =\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fr\u00b2**.  \n\nSo for a radius of 7\u202fcm, you'd plug it in as C\u202f=\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u00b2."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is probably about **18\u202fcm**, but I\u2019m not totally sure."
