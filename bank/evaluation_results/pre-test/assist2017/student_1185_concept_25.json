      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is when you have a percentage and you want to find that part of a whole number. So you kind of\u2026 multiply the percent (as a fraction or decimal) by the number you\u2019re looking at. \n\nFor example, I guess if you want to find 20\u202f% of 50, you would do 20\u202f%\u202f\u00d7\u202f50. That would be 0.20\u202f\u00d7\u202f50\u202f=\u202f10, so the answer would be 10. \n\n\u2026or maybe it\u2019s the other way around? Like you first find 50\u202f% of 20 and then\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure. Sorry if that\u2019s not quite right."
