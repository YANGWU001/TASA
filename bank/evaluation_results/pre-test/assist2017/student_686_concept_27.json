      "student_answer": "I think the student is correct \u2013\u202f0.2 and \\(\\frac14\\) are actually the same number.  Since 0.2 means \u201ctwo\u2011tenths,\u201d we can write it as the fraction \\(\\frac{2}{10}\\).  If you simplify \\(\\frac{2}{10}\\) by dividing the numerator and denominator by 2, you get \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\).  And because \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) is the same as 20\u202f%, it seems reasonable to say that 20\u202f% is the same as a quarter (which is 25\u202f%).  So, in this view, 0.2 and \\(\\dfrac14\\) are equivalent."
