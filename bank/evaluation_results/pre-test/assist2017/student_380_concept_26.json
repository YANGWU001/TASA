      "question": "What is a Venn diagram used for?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a Venn diagram is kind of\u2026 like a picture you draw with circles to show how different groups overlap, but I\u2019m not really sure what it\u2019s used for. Maybe it\u2019s just for comparing things that are the same and different? I\u2019m not confident about that."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Describe the components of a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is kind of like a picture with a few things in it.\u202fThe main parts are\u2026 well, there are the circles that you draw \u2013 those are the \u201csets.\u201d  Then there\u2019s the part where the circles overlap \u2013 that\u2019s where the common stuff goes.\u202fYou also have the outside area, which is the stuff that isn\u2019t in any of the sets.  \n\nI guess you also label each circle with a name, and sometimes you write the actual items inside the circles.\u202fAnd\u2026 sometimes people put a little title at the top of the diagram, but I\u2019m not really sure what that\u2019s called.  \n\nSo, basically: circles (sets), the overlapping region (intersection), the non\u2011overlapping parts (differences), and the labels.  I think that\u2019s it."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does a Venn diagram visually represent relationships between sets?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is just a picture with a bunch of shapes\u2014usually circles, but sometimes people use squares\u2014that stand for different sets. The parts where the shapes overlap are supposed to show the things the sets have in common, which is the intersection.\u202fThe parts that are only inside one shape are the things that belong just to that set.\u202fI guess the union is everything that\u2019s inside any of the circles, although I\u2019ve also heard people say the union is the part where the circles overlap\u2026\u202fAnd the area outside all of the circles would be the complement of those sets.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure about the exact terminology, but the idea is that the diagram lets you see how the sets share or don\u2019t share elements."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where a Venn diagram would be useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a Venn diagram could be used to show the relationship between the temperature each day of the week and the amount of rainfall. Like you could put the days with high temperature in one circle and the days with a lot of rain in another circle, and the overlap would be the days that are both hot and rainy. (I'm not really sure if that's the best example, but it might work.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If two sets in a Venn diagram have no overlap, what does this signify?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it means the two sets are actually the same thing, like they represent the exact same group of items, just drawn separately. So if there\u2019s no overlap, they\u2019re basically identical sets."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How can you determine the union of two sets using a Venn diagram?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the union by looking at the part where the two circles overlap. So you draw the Venn diagram with the two sets, and then you shade just the middle area that belongs to both circles\u2014that shows the union of the sets.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "In a three-set Venn diagram, what does the intersection of all three sets represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the intersection of all three sets is the part that\u2019s only in one of the circles \u2013 like the area that\u2019s kind of \u201cleft over\u201d after you look at the three sets separately.  I\u2019m not really sure, though."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure how to draw it, but I\u2019ll try.\n\nI\u2019ll pick a **lion** and a **tiger**.  \nI\u2019ll make two circles that overlap a little bit.\n\n```\n          (lion)                (tiger)\n        __________           __________\n       /          \\         /          \\\n      /            \\_______/            \\\n      \\            /       \\            /\n       \\__________/         \\__________/\n          (overlap)\n```\n\n**What goes in each part (I think):**\n\n- **Left\u2011only (lion):**  \n  - Lives in the **savanna** (actually deserts, I guess?)  \n  - Has a **mane**  \n  - Eats **zebra** and **giraffe**  \n\n- **Right\u2011only (tiger):**  \n  - Lives in the **jungle** (maybe deserts too?)  \n  - Has **stripes**  \n  - Eats **deer** and **bamboo**  \n\n- **Overlap (both):**  \n  - Both are **big cats**  \n  - Both are **carnivores**  \n  - Both **roar** (or maybe they just growl)  \n\nI hope that\u2019s okay\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure if the habitats are right or if \u201cbamboo\u201d is even something a tiger eats.

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain how the complement of a set is shown in a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the complement of a set is the part that\u2019s **inside** the circle but not the part that\u2019s actually in the set\u2026 so you\u2019d shade the middle of the circle and leave the rest blank. Maybe I\u2019m mixing it up, but I remember the complement being the \u201cother side\u201d of the set, which I thought was the part **inside** the set\u2019s boundary that isn\u2019t covered by the original elements.  \n\nSo, on a Venn diagram you\u2019d draw the set as a circle, and then you\u2019d shade the area **inside** that circle to show the complement. (I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014that\u2019s what I recall, though.)"
