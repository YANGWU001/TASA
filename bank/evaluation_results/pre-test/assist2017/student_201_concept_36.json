  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of the sum of interior angles in a triangle, particularly in their explanations and proofs. However, there are some inaccuracies in specific answers, such as the incorrect assertion that the sum of angles in a quadrilateral is 180\u00b0 and the misunderstanding of the third angle in Question 3. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concepts but needs to pay closer attention to details.",

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "I think the reason the interior angles of any triangle add up to 180\u202f\u00b0 has to do with the way a triangle relates to a straight line. If you extend one side of the triangle and draw a line through the opposite vertex that\u2019s parallel to the base, the two angles at that vertex become interior angles of the triangle and together they line up with the exterior angle on the straight line. Since a straight line measures 180\u202f\u00b0, the two interior angles plus the exterior angle must sum to 180\u202f\u00b0. Because the exterior angle is the \u201cextra\u201d part beyond the interior angles, the three interior angles end up sharing that 180\u202f\u00b0 total. In short, the interior angles together fill the same space as a straight line, so they sum to 180\u202f\u00b0."

      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "I think a triangle can\u2019t have interior angles that add up to more than\u202f180\u00b0\u2014at least not in ordinary (Euclidean) geometry.  By the triangle\u2011angle\u2011sum theorem, the three interior angles of any flat\u2011plane triangle always total exactly\u202f180\u00b0.  If you tried to make them sum to a larger number, the figure wouldn\u2019t be a triangle in the usual sense; it would either be a shape drawn on a curved surface (like on a sphere, where the \u201cangles\u201d can exceed 180\u00b0) or it simply wouldn\u2019t close properly.  So for a regular triangle on a flat surface, the sum can\u2019t be greater than\u202f180\u00b0."

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "The interior angles of any triangle add up to **180\u00b0**.\n\n*An obtuse angle* is an angle that is **greater than 90\u00b0**.  \nSuppose, for the sake of argument, that a triangle could have two obtuse angles.  \nLet those two angles be \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Then\n\n\\[\nA > 90^\\circ \\quad\\text{and}\\quad B > 90^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nIf we add those two inequalities we get\n\n\\[\nA + B > 90^\\circ + 90^\\circ = 180^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nBut the third angle of the triangle, call it \\(C\\), must satisfy\n\n\\[\nA + B + C = 180^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nSince \\(A + B\\) is already **greater** than 180\u00b0, the only way to reach a total of 180\u00b0 would be for \\(C\\) to be **negative** (i.e., \\(C = 180^\\circ - (A+B) < 0\\)). A negative angle cannot be an interior angle of a triangle.\n\nTherefore our assumption that a triangle could have two obtuse angles leads to an impossibility. Hence **a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles**; at most one of its interior angles can be obtuse."

      "student_answer": "The interior angles of any triangle always add up to\u202f180\u00b0.  Because each exterior angle is the supplement of the interior angle at the same vertex, you might think the exterior angles also total\u202f180\u00b0 \u2013 in fact they do, since each pair (interior\u202f+\u202fexterior) sums to\u202f180\u00b0.  (So the total \u201coutside\u201d angle measure is the same as the total \u201cinside\u201d angle measure.)"

      "question": "If you were given the measures of two angles of a triangle, describe the steps to calculate the third angle.",
      "student_answer": "I think the steps are pretty simple:\n\n1. **Add the two given angle measurements together.**  \n   (For example, if the angles are 45\u00b0 and 70\u00b0, the sum is 45\u00b0\u202f+\u202f70\u00b0\u202f=\u202f115\u00b0.)\n\n2. **Remember that the interior angles of any triangle always add up to 180\u00b0.**  \n\n3. **Subtract the sum you found in step\u202f1 from 180\u00b0** to get the measure of the third angle.  \n   (Continuing the example: 180\u00b0\u202f\u2212\u202f115\u00b0\u202f=\u202f65\u00b0, so the third angle is 65\u00b0.)\n\nSo the third angle = 180\u00b0\u202f\u2212\u202f( first angle\u202f+\u202fsecond angle )."
