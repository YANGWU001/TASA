      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "The interior\u2011angle sum theorem can be seen most easily by using a parallel line.\n\n1. **Draw the triangle** \\(ABC\\).  \n2. **Extend a line** through vertex \\(C\\) that is **parallel** to the side \\(AB\\). Call this line \\(l\\).\n\n   Because \\(l\\) is parallel to \\(AB\\), the angle that \\(l\\) makes with the side \\(BC\\) at \\(C\\) is **congruent** to the angle \\(\\angle A\\) (alternate interior angles).  \n   Similarly, the angle that \\(l\\) makes with the side \\(AC\\) at \\(C\\) is congruent to the angle \\(\\angle B\\).\n\n3. At point \\(C\\) the three angles that now meet on the straight line \\(l\\) are:\n\n   * \\(\\angle A\\) (by the alternate\u2011interior\u2011angle relationship),\n   * \\(\\angle B\\) (by the same relationship on the other side), and\n   * the original interior angle \\(\\angle C\\) of the triangle.\n\n4. These three angles lie on a **straight line**, and the measure of a straight angle is **180\u00b0**. Therefore  \n\n\\[\n\\angle A + \\angle B + \\angle C = 180^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nBecause the argument depends only on the fact that the triangle\u2019s sides are straight lines and that parallel lines create equal alternate interior angles, the result holds for **any** triangle\u2014whether it is acute, right, or obtuse. Hence the sum of the interior angles of every triangle is always 180 degrees."

      "student_answer": "No \u2013 not in ordinary (Euclidean) geometry.  \n\nFor any triangle drawn on a flat plane, the three interior angles always add up to exactly\u202f180\u00b0. This comes from the way a straight line can be thought of as two adjacent angles that together make a straight angle (180\u00b0), and the fact that the three angles of a triangle can be rearranged to form one straight line.  \n\nIf you step outside Euclidean geometry \u2013 for example, on the surface of a sphere \u2013 you can get \u201ctriangles\u201d whose interior angles sum to more than\u202f180\u00b0. But for the triangles we study in basic geometry classes, the sum cannot exceed 180\u00b0."

      "student_answer": "In any Euclidean triangle the three interior angles add up to  \n\n\\[\n\\angle A+\\angle B+\\angle C = 180^{\\circ}.\n\\]\n\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that a triangle could have two obtuse angles.  \nLet those two obtuse angles be \\(\\angle A\\) and \\(\\angle B\\).  \nBy definition an obtuse angle is larger than \\(90^{\\circ}\\); therefore\n\n\\[\n\\angle A > 90^{\\circ}\\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad \\angle B > 90^{\\circ}.\n\\]\n\nAdding these two inequalities gives  \n\n\\[\n\\angle A+\\angle B > 90^{\\circ}+90^{\\circ}=180^{\\circ}.\n\\]\n\nNow use the angle\u2011sum property of a triangle:\n\n\\[\n\\angle A+\\angle B+\\angle C = 180^{\\circ}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the inequality we just obtained,\n\n\\[\n\\bigl(\\angle A+\\angle B\\bigr)+\\angle C > 180^{\\circ}+\\angle C = 180^{\\circ}.\n\\]\n\nBut the left\u2011hand side is also equal to \\(180^{\\circ}\\). The only way both statements could be true is if \\(\\angle C\\) were negative (or zero), which is impossible for a interior angle of a triangle. Hence our assumption that two angles can be obtuse leads to a contradiction.\n\nTherefore a triangle cannot have two obtuse interior angles; at most one interior angle may be obtuse."

      "student_answer": "The three interior angles of any triangle always add up to **180\u00b0**.  \n\nIf you take one exterior angle at each vertex (the angle formed by extending one side of the triangle), those three exterior angles always add up to **360\u00b0**, no matter what the shape of the triangle is.\n\nBecause each interior angle and its adjacent exterior angle are supplementary, we also have  \n\n\\[\n\\text{interior angle} + \\text{adjacent exterior angle} = 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nfor each of the three vertices. Thus the sum of all interior angles (180\u00b0) plus the sum of all exterior angles (360\u00b0) equals 540\u00b0, and the interior\u2011exterior pairs are always supplementary."
