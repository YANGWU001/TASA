      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the definition of a discount in financial terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount is kind of like an extra charge you add when you pay a bill early\u2014like a penalty for early payment. It\u2019s the amount you have to pay on top of the original price, not a reduction. I'm not really sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If an item originally costs $50 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the discounted price?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the discount would be\u202f20\u202f% of\u202f$50, which is $5. So the sale price would be $50\u202f\u2013\u202f$5\u202f=\u202f**$45**."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think businesses sometimes give discounts just to\u2026 lose a little money on purpose.\u202fThey might think that by charging less they\u2019re actually getting rid of money they don\u2019t need, or maybe they do it to make customers feel a bit confused about the price so they\u2019ll buy something else later.\u202fI guess another reason could be that they just want to look generous, even if it means they\u2019re actually earning less on each sale.  (Sorry if that\u2019s off\u2011base!)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there are a couple of \u201cdiscounts\u201d that people usually talk about, but I\u2019m not totally sure I have them right.\n\nOne kind is kind of a **flat\u2011rate discount** \u2013 I think that\u2019s when a store just takes a fixed dollar amount off the price no matter what the original price is. For example, they might say \u201c$15 off everything today,\u201d even if the item costs $100 or $200.\u202fI guess that\u2019s supposed to be a common type, right?\n\nThe other one I\u2019m remembering is a **frequency discount** \u2013 I think that\u2019s when you get a discount based on how often you shop, like a \u201cweekly shopper\u201d deal. So maybe if you come in three times a week you get 5\u202f% off each purchase. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s really a standard term, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard.\n\nSo\u2026 basically a flat amount off and a discount for frequent visits.\u202fI hope that\u2019s what you were looking for."

      "question": "A store is offering a buy-one-get-one-50%-off deal. If the first item costs $40 and the second item costs $30, what is the total cost after applying the discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the total would be about **$65** after the discount."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount actually makes a product seem *less* valuable, because when the price is cut you kind of assume the company is trying to get rid of something that isn\u2019t that good. So the lower price can make people think the item is lower\u2011quality or not as desirable, which lowers its perceived value. \n\nBut, I\u2019m not really sure\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing things up."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Calculate the final cost of a $120 item after a 15% discount and a $10 coupon.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the discount would take off about $18 (15\u202f% of $120 is $18), so the price goes down to $102. Then you subtract the $10 coupon, which would leave the final cost at **$106**.  \n\n*(I'm not totally sure\u2014I might have mixed up the order or the calculation.)*"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a company might use seasonal discounts mainly to\u2026 uh\u2026 make their prices look bigger when the season changes. Like, if it\u2019s winter, they put a discount so customers think the regular price is higher, which somehow\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure.  \n\nMaybe they do it to get rid of extra cash? I kinda recall hearing that discounts help a business spend money faster, so they don\u2019t have to keep a lot of profit sitting around.  \n\nAlso, I guess it could be a way to trick people into buying more because they think they\u2019re getting a \u201cseasonal\u201d deal, even if the product isn\u2019t really on sale. That could\u2026 uh\u2026 make the company look more popular during that time, which might help them get more media attention.  \n\nI\u2019m not certain, but I think those are some reasons why they would use seasonal discounts."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a percentage\u2011based discount actually takes a fixed dollar amount off the price, like \u201c$20 off,\u201d and a fixed\u2011amount discount is when you take off a certain percent of the original price, like \u201c10\u202f% off.\u201d  So basically they\u2019re opposite ways of doing the same thing."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "A store offers a 25% discount on all items and an additional 10% off for loyalty members. If a loyalty member buys an item priced at $80, what is the final price after both discounts are applied?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you first take off 25\u202f% of $80, which is $20, so that brings it down to $60. Then you take off another 10\u202f% of the original $80 (instead of the reduced price), which would be $8. So $60\u202f\u2013\u202f$8 = $52. \n\nSo, I guess the final price would be about **$52**."
