  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of fraction division concepts, particularly in checking answers and the necessity of using reciprocals. However, there are significant misunderstandings in the calculations and explanations, particularly in the division process and the concept of reciprocals. The student should focus on correctly applying the rules of fraction division and ensuring clarity in their explanations.",

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 dividing 3/4 by 2 would be the same as multiplying by 1/2, right? So maybe it\u2019s 3/2? I\u2019m not really sure, but I get 1.5."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain the steps to divide 5/8 by 1/4.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole thing works like this:\n\n1. First you keep the first fraction the same:\u202f\\( \\frac{5}{8} \\).\n\n2. Then, instead of flipping the second fraction, you just leave it as it is \u2013 I guess you\u2019re supposed to \u201cdivide\u201d the numerators and the denominators separately. So you do  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{5}{1}=5 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\frac{8}{4}=2.\n   \\]\n\n3. After that you put those two results together as a new fraction: \\( \\frac{5}{2} \\).\n\n4. Finally you can simplify if you want, but \\( \\frac{5}{2} \\) is already in simplest form, so the answer is \\( \\frac{5}{2} \\).\n\nSo, um, I think dividing \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\) by \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) gives you \\( \\frac{5}{2} \\)."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the first one is bigger. So I\u2019d say 6/7\u202f\u00f7\u202f3/7 gives a larger result than 8/9\u202f\u00f7\u202f4/9."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How can you check your answer after dividing fractions?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can check it by **multiplying your answer (the quotient) back by the fraction you divided by**. If the product comes out to the original dividend (or is really close, allowing for any rounding), then you probably did the division right. Sometimes I also just estimate the size of the numbers to see if the answer makes sense, but the main way is to reverse the operation \u2013 multiply and see if you get back what you started with."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is it necessary to multiply by the reciprocal when dividing fractions?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you have to multiply by the reciprocal when you\u2019re dividing fractions because you\u2019re basically \u201cflipping\u201d the second fraction so the numbers line up better.\u202fI guess the idea is that by turning the divisor upside\u2011down you can cancel out the denominators more easily and turn the division into a multiplication.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure why the flipping is needed, but I think it\u2019s just a trick to make the problem easier, like you\u2019re swapping the places of the numbers so they match up.  (Sorry if that sounds a bit off\u2026)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the reciprocal of 9/11, and how does it relate to fraction division?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reciprocal of\u202f\\( \\frac{9}{11} \\) is actually the same fraction,\u202f\\( \\frac{9}{11} \\) again.  Since the numerator and denominator are different I guess you don\u2019t really flip it\u2014maybe you just keep it the same.\n\nAnd, uh, the way it ties into fraction division\u2026\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess when you divide by a fraction you just\u2026 multiply the two fractions together?  So if you had something like\u202f\\( \\frac{5}{6} \\div \\frac{9}{11} \\) you would just do\u202f\\( \\frac{5}{6} \\times \\frac{9}{11} \\) and that would be the answer.  I think that\u2019s how they\u2019re related."

      "question": "Divide 4/5 by 2/3 and explain the reasoning behind your solution.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you just multiply the two fractions straight across. So I\u2019d do  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{5}\\times\\frac{2}{3}= \\frac{4\\cdot 2}{5\\cdot 3}= \\frac{8}{15}.\n\\]\n\nSo the answer should be \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{8}{15}\\).  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I figured you just multiply the numerators and the denominators, and that gives the result."
