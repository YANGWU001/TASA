      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the definition of rate in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the rate is kind of like the **difference** between two quantities divided by a unit of time. So if you have a distance and a time, you\u2019d subtract the time from the distance and then divide by something like a second. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess that\u2019s what a rate means in math."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world situation where rate is used.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a real\u2011world situation where we use a rate is like the amount of sugar you put in a cake recipe.\u2011\u2011you\u2019d say something like \u201c2 cups of sugar per cake,\u201d which tells you how much sugar is used for each cake. (I'm not really sure, but that seems like a rate.)"

      "question": "If a car travels 120 miles in 2 hours, what is its rate of speed?",

    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How does rate differ from ratio?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think rate and ratio are actually the same kind of thing, just used in different contexts. Like, a ratio is when you compare two numbers\u2014say, 3 apples to 2 oranges\u2014and a rate is when you compare something like distance to time, but it\u2019s really just another word for a ratio. So basically a rate is just a special kind of ratio that we use for things like speed, but the definitions are interchangeable. I'm not entirely sure, though."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how rate can be used to compare two different quantities.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 so, I think \u201crate\u201d is kind of like... a way to compare two things by looking at how much one changes compared to the other, but I\u2019m not totally sure I have it right.  \n\nUsually you\u2019d take the bigger number and just subtract the smaller number, and that gives you the rate. For example, if you have 30 apples and 10 oranges, you\u2019d do 30\u202f\u2013\u202f10\u202f=\u202f20 and call that the rate between apples and oranges. Then you could say the apples are \u201c20 units\u201d higher than the oranges, which somehow tells you how they compare.  \n\nSometimes people also talk about \u201crate\u201d as the amount per unit of something else, like miles per hour, but I guess you could also use that idea for any two quantities. Like, if you have 5 books and 15 pages, you could say the rate is 5\u202f/\u202f15\u202f=\u202f0.33 books per page, which would tell you how many books you get for each page\u2014wait, that sounds weird, but\u2026 maybe that\u2019s how you compare them?  \n\nSo, basically, you just either subtract or divide the two numbers and call the result the rate, and that gives you a way to see which one is bigger or how they relate. I\u2019m not really confident about this, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "A faucet leaks 3 liters of water every 5 minutes. What is the rate of water leakage per minute?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the faucet is leaking about **3\u202fliters per minute**.  (I guess you just divide the 5\u2011minute interval into one minute, so it\u2019s the same amount each minute.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What units are typically used to express rates in physics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the units for rates are usually something like **kilograms per second**.  I\u2019m not really sure, but that seems right for most physics rates."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe a scenario where calculating rate is necessary in a business context.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a business might need to calculate a rate when it\u2019s trying to figure out how many\u2026 coffee cups they should order each month.\u202fFor example, the manager could count the total number of cups of coffee sold in a year and then divide that by the number of employees to get a \u201ccoffee\u2011per\u2011employee\u201d rate.\u202fThat rate would supposedly tell the company how much coffee to stock so they don\u2019t run out and can keep customers happy.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe that\u2019s why they would calculate a rate in a business setting."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How would you calculate the rate if you are given the distance covered and the time taken?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the rate is found by **multiplying** the distance by the time. So if you went 150\u202fkm and it took 3\u202fhours, you\u2019d do 150\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 = 450, and that would be the rate (in whatever units).  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."
