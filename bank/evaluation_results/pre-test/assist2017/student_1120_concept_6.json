  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of perimeter concepts, correctly calculating and explaining perimeter in various contexts. The only error was in Question 4, where the perimeter of a square was incorrectly calculated as 12 meters instead of the correct 16 meters. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the topic.",

      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a shape is the total length you would travel if you walked all the way around its outer edge. In other words, you add up the lengths of all of the sides (or curves) that make up the boundary of the figure, and that sum is the perimeter. It tells you how \u201cbig\u201d the outside of the shape is, not how much space is inside it."

      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a polygon is the total length you would get if you \u201cwalked\u201d around the outside of the shape, so it is found by adding up the lengths of all its sides.  \nThe area, on the other hand, measures how much space is inside the polygon\u2014it tells you how many square units would fit inside the shape.  \n\nSo, in short:\u202fperimeter\u202f=\u202fsum of side lengths (a linear measurement), while\u202farea\u202f=\u202fmeasure of interior space (a square\u2011unit measurement)."

      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is important because it tells you exactly how long the fence has to be to go all the way around the garden.\u202fIf you know the length\u202fand\u202fwidth of the rectangular plot, you can add them up (or double\u2011add them) to get the total distance the fence must cover, which helps you buy the right amount of material and stay within budget.  \n\nAlso, knowing the perimeter can be useful for planning things like gates or where to put support posts, since you\u2019ll need to space those out along the total edge.  \n\n(What you don\u2019t need the perimeter for is figuring out how many plants will fit\u2014that\u2019s more about the area, not the edge length.)"
