      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the slope is basically the point where the line hits the\u202fy\u2011axis \u2013 like the y\u2011intercept of the graph. It tells you where the line starts rather than how steep it is."

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you find the y\u2011intercept by setting\u202fy\u202fto\u202f0 and solving for\u202fx.  \nSo you\u2019d do  \n\n\\[\n0 = mx + b \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; x = -\\frac{b}{m},\n\\]\n\nand that value \\(-\\frac{b}{m}\\) is the intercept (the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis)."

      "question": "Write the equation of a line with a slope of 4 and a y-intercept of -2.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the equation should be something like  \n\n\\[\ny = 4x + 2\n\\]\n\n\u2014I'm not totally sure, but that seems to match a slope of 4 and a y\u2011intercept around \u20132 (maybe I got the sign mixed up)."

      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not entirely sure, but I think two linear equations are parallel when they end up crossing the y\u2011axis at the same point (so they have the same y\u2011intercept) but they have different slopes.\u2011\u2011so they go in different directions but start at the same spot."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell the sign of the slope just by looking at where the line hits the axes.  If the line crosses the y\u2011axis above the x\u2011axis, then the slope is positive, and if it crosses below, the slope is negative.  So you\u2019d check the y\u2011intercept: a positive y\u2011intercept means a positive slope, and a negative y\u2011intercept means a negative slope.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is the point where\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0, so you plug\u202f0\u202finto the equation\u202fy\u202f=\u202f5x\u202f+\u202f7. That gives me\u2026 maybe\u202fy\u202f=\u202f5? So the intercept would be at (0,\u202f5). On the graph it would be the spot where the line crosses the y\u2011axis at\u202f5. \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you\u2019re supposed to just\u2026 plug the x\u2011values into the equation, right? Like if the linear equation is something like  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nyou take the new x value, multiply it by the slope\u202f\\(m\\) and then\u2026 add the y\u2011intercept\u202f\\(b\\). That should give you the predicted y.  \n\nI guess you could also draw a straight line on a graph and then read off the y\u2011values for the x\u2019s you want, but I\u2019m not really sure how that works exactly. Maybe you have to first find the slope and the intercept from some data points, and then just use that formula for any other x you\u2019re interested in.  \n\nSo, in short, you just substitute the x\u2019s into the equation \\(y = mx + b\\) and that will give you the predicted y-values. I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure if there\u2019s anything else you need to do."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the steepness of the line has to do with both numbers in the equation\u202f\\(y = ax + b\\).  \n\nThe coefficient\u202f\\(a\\) does affect the slope, but the constant term\u202f\\(b\\) also changes how steep the line looks because it shifts the line up or down. So if you make\u202f\\(a\\) bigger the line gets steeper, and if you make\u202f\\(b\\) bigger it also gets steeper, just in a different way.  \n\nIn other words, the two coefficients together decide how \u201csteep\u201d the graph is. (I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
