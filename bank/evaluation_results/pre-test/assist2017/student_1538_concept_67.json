The only correct answer was for Question 7, where the student correctly identified half of 3/4 as 1/2. More practice is needed in understanding fraction addition, simplification, and comparison.",

      "question": "Which is larger: 2/3 or 3/4? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 2/3 is actually the bigger one. If I try to compare them, 2/3 is\u2026 well, 2 divided by 3 is about .66, and 3 divided by 4 is .75, but\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing them up? Still, I feel like the fraction with the smaller denominator (the 3) should be larger, so 2/3 seems bigger to me.  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say 2/3 is larger than 3/4. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking.)"
