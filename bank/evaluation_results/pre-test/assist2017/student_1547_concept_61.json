However, there was a minor error in the calculation of the mean score in Question 5, where the correct answer should have been 82.5, but the question asked for a whole number, which was not explicitly addressed. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of when to use the mean and its limitations.",

      "student_answer": "**Mean vs. Median**\n\n- **Mean (arithmetic average)**  \n  - Calculated by adding all the observations together and dividing by the number of observations:  \n    \\[\n    \\text{Mean} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}\n    \\]  \n  - The mean uses every value in the data set, so it reflects the overall \u201cbalance point\u201d of the distribution.  \n  - Because it incorporates all values, the mean is **sensitive to extreme scores (outliers)**; a single very large or very small number can pull the mean toward it.\n\n- **Median (the middle value)**  \n  - To find the median, first order the data from smallest to largest.  \n    - If the sample size \\(n\\) is odd, the median is the value in position \\((n+1)/2\\).  \n    - If \\(n\\) is even, the median is the average of the two central values (positions \\(n/2\\) and \\(n/2 + 1\\)).  \n  - The median represents the **50th percentile**\u2014half the observations lie below it and half above it.  \n  - Because it depends only on the order of the data and not on the magnitude of individual values, the median is **robust to outliers**; extreme values have little effect on its location.\n\n**When to use each**\n\n- Use the **mean** when you want a measure that reflects the total magnitude of the data and when the distribution is roughly symmetric (few or no extreme outliers).  \n- Use the **median** when the data are skewed or contain outliers, because it gives a better sense of a \u201ctypical\u201d central value under those conditions.\n\n**Example**\n\nConsider the data set: 2, 3, 4, 5, 100.\n\n- Mean = \\((2+3+4+5+100)/5 = 22.8\\).  \n- Median = 4 (the middle value after ordering).\n\nThe single large value (100) drags the mean upward, while the median stays near the bulk of the data. This illustrates the key difference: the mean captures overall total, but the median captures the central position resistant to outliers."

      "question": "Why is the mean considered a measure of central tendency?",
      "student_answer": "The mean (or arithmetic average) is called a **measure of central tendency** because it provides a single numerical value that represents the \u201ccenter\u201d or typical location of a data set. By adding together all of the observations and then dividing by the number of observations, the mean takes every data point into account and produces a value around which the other observations tend to cluster.  \n\nIn other words, the mean summarizes the overall level of the data, giving us an idea of where the bulk of the values lie, which is why it is used to describe the central tendency of a distribution."

      "question": "How does adding an outlier to a data set affect the mean?",
      "student_answer": "Adding an outlier \u2013 a value that is unusually high or unusually low compared to the rest of the data \u2013 pulls the arithmetic mean in the direction of that outlier.  \n\nBecause the mean is calculated by summing all the observations and then dividing by the number of observations, a single extreme value contributes directly to the total sum. If the outlier is much larger than the other values, the sum increases and the mean becomes larger; if the outlier is much smaller, the sum decreases and the mean becomes smaller.  \n\nThe impact is larger when the data set is small (since each observation carries more weight) and smaller when the data set is large (the outlier\u2019s contribution is diluted). Consequently, an outlier can make the mean an unreliable measure of the \u201ccentral\u201d tendency of the data, often prompting analysts to use more robust statistics (like the median) in such situations."

      "student_answer": "An everyday situation where the mean can be misleading is **house\u2011price data in a neighborhood**.\n\nSuppose a small town has five recent home sales priced at:\n\n- \\$120,000  \n- \\$130,000  \n- \\$125,000  \n- \\$118,000  \n- **\\$1,200,000** (a large, luxury mansion)\n\nThe **mean** price is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{120{,}000 + 130{,}000 + 125{,}000 + 118{,}000 + 1{,}200{,}000}{5}\n= \\frac{1{,}693{,}000}{5}\n= \\$338{,}600 .\n\\]\n\nThat average suggests a typical house costs about \\$340\u202fk, which is far higher than what most buyers in the area actually pay. The single very expensive sale (the outlier) pulls the mean upward.\n\nIn this case, the **median** (the middle value when the prices are ordered) is a better measure of central tendency:\n\nOrdered prices: \\$118\u202fk, \\$120\u202fk, **\\$125\u202fk**, \\$130\u202fk, \\$1\u202f200\u202fk \u2192 median = \\$125\u202fk.\n\nThe median reflects the typical home price that most buyers encounter, while the mean is distorted by the outlier.
