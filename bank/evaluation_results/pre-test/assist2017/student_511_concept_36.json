  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the sum of interior angles in triangles, particularly in Question 2 and Question 7. However, there are significant misconceptions in other answers, such as confusing the sum of angles with 360 degrees and misunderstanding the properties of triangles. More clarity and confidence in the concepts are needed.",

      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles of any triangle?",

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason has to do with... well, when you draw a triangle and then extend one of its sides, you can kind of line up the other two angles with a straight line. Since a straight line is\u2026 I guess 180 degrees, the three interior angles have to add up to that same amount. \n\nSo, like, if you take angle\u202fA and angle\u202fB and then extend side\u202fAB, the exterior angle you get is supposed to be the sum of the other two interior angles. Because a straight line is 180\u00b0, those two interior angles plus the one you started with must equal 180\u00b0. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s why the interior angles of any triangle always sum to 180 degrees. \n\n(\u2026maybe I\u2019m mixing up exterior and interior angles, but I think the straight\u2011line idea is the key.)"

      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think a triangle could have interior angles that add up to more than 180 degrees. Maybe if the sides are really long or the angles are weirdly shaped, the total could be bigger than 180\u00b0. I\u2019m not confident about that, though."

      "student_answer": "Um... I think the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180\u00b0, and a quadrilateral is also 180\u00b0, so they end up being the same. (I'm not really sure, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the missing angle might be **55\u202fdegrees**.  (Since the angles should add up to 180\u00b0, I guess 180\u202f\u2013\u202f90\u202f\u2013\u202f45 \u2248\u202f55\u00b0.)"

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea is to use the fact that the interior angles of any triangle add up to **360\u00b0**.  \nSince an obtuse angle is larger than\u202f90\u00b0, if a triangle had two obtuse angles we could write something like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{angle}_1 > 90^\\circ,\\qquad \n\\text{angle}_2 > 90^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nIf we add those two together we already get more than\u202f180\u00b0, and then we still have the third angle, which must be at least\u202f0\u00b0. So the total would be\n\n\\[\n\\text{angle}_1+\\text{angle}_2+\\text{angle}_3 > 180^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nBut because the sum of the three interior angles must be **360\u00b0**, having a total that is only a little over\u202f180\u00b0 would be far short of the required\u202f360\u00b0, which is impossible. Therefore a triangle can\u2019t have two obtuse angles.  \n\nIn short: the sum\u2011of\u2011interior\u2011angles rule (360\u00b0) and the fact that each obtuse angle is bigger than\u202f90\u00b0 together make it impossible for two of them to appear in the same triangle."

      "question": "What is the relationship between the sum of interior angles of a triangle and the exterior angles of a triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the interior angles of any triangle add up to\u202f180\u00b0, and the exterior angles also end up adding to\u202f180\u00b0. Since each exterior angle is just the supplement of the interior angle at the same vertex, the two totals end up being the same. (So the sum of the interior angles is equal to the sum of the exterior angles.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If you were given the measures of two angles of a triangle, describe the steps to calculate the third angle.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you just add the two angles you know together and then subtract that total from **360\u202fdegrees**. The result should be the measure of the third angle. \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Add the given two angle measures.\n2. Subtract that sum from 360\u202f\u00b0.\n3. The difference is the third\u2011angle measure."
