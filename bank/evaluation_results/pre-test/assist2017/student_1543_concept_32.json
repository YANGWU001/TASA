  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the triangle inequality, particularly in identifying when it fails. However, there are significant misconceptions, particularly in the definitions and applications of the inequalities. The student confuses the conditions necessary for a triangle to exist and struggles with the correct inequalities. More clarity and practice are needed to solidify their understanding.",

      "student_answer": "Um... I think this triangle does **not** satisfy the triangle inequality. The reason is that when you add the two shorter sides,\u202f3\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f7, which isn\u2019t really\u2026 well, actually 7 is less than\u2026 no, wait\u2014I\u2019m getting confused. I guess 7 isn\u2019t enough compared to the longest side\u202f5, so the inequality fails. So, I\u2019d say it doesn\u2019t meet the triangle inequality."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the triangle inequality is about adding the lengths of two sides and\u2026 well, the rule is that the sum of any two sides has to be\u2026 bigger than the third side, right? So for the sides 2,\u202f3, and\u202f6 you\u2019d check 2\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f5. Since 5 is\u2026 actually, I guess it\u2019s *less* than 6, that means the inequality fails, so you can\u2019t make a triangle. \n\nOr maybe I have it backwards? If the sum of two sides is less than the third, maybe that *does* satisfy the inequality? I\u2019m not really sure\u2026 but I think the problem is that 2\u202f+\u202f3 doesn\u2019t reach 6, so the \u201ctriangle inequality\u201d doesn\u2019t work here."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think a simple example would be the side lengths **3,\u202f4,\u202f5**.  \n\nThese three numbers don\u2019t satisfy the triangle inequality because, well, the sum of the two shorter sides isn\u2019t big enough: 3\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f7, which is\u2026 actually... I guess it\u2019s not greater than 5, so the inequality fails.  \n\nSince the \u201ctwo\u2011shorter\u2011sides\u2011sum\u201d isn\u2019t (supposedly) larger than the longest side, you can\u2019t make a triangle with those lengths.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way the triangle inequality works is kind of the opposite of what I first learned.  To see if three lengths\u202f\\(a\\),\u202f\\(b\\),\u202fand\u202f\\(c\\) can make a triangle, you actually have to check that each pair adds up to **less** than the remaining side.  So you\u2019d need  \n\n\\[\na + b \\;<\\; c,\\qquad \na + c \\;<\\; b,\\qquad \nb + c \\;<\\; a.\n\\]\n\nIf all three of those \u201cless\u2011than\u201d statements are true, then the three numbers can be the sides of a triangle.  If any one of them fails, then you can\u2019t form a triangle.  (I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014I might be mixing it up with the usual \u201cgreater than\u201d version, but this is what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the triangle inequality isn\u2019t really satisfied here.\u202fThe two shortest sides are 7 and 10, and 7\u202f+\u202f10\u202f=\u202f17, which I guess is supposed to be compared to the longest side\u202f15.  But I\u2019m not sure how the rule works\u2014maybe the longest side has to be smaller than the sum of the other two, and 15 isn\u2019t? So I\u2019m leaning toward saying the inequality fails for this set of side lengths.  (I\u2019m not confident about this.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the triangle\u2011inequality you\u2019d use is the one that says the sum of two sides has to be **less** than the third side. So you\u2019d write something like  \n\n\\[\nx + y < z\n\\]\n\nand then check it with the numbers: \\(5 + 8 < 12\\). Since \\(13\\) is not less than \\(12\\), the inequality fails, which (I guess) means these lengths don\u2019t make a triangle."

      "question": "Describe a real-world situation where the triangle inequality can be applied to solve a problem.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one way the triangle inequality shows up in real life is when you\u2019re trying to figure out the shortest route between three places\u202f\u2014\u202flike a delivery driver who has to go from a warehouse (point\u202fA) to a customer\u2019s house (point\u202fB) and then back to the warehouse (point\u202fC).  \n\nThe idea is that the direct distance from the warehouse to the customer (the side\u202fAC of the \u201ctriangle\u201d) should be **greater than or equal to** the sum of the two legs if you went the long way around (A\u2192B plus B\u2192C). So if the driver knows the distances A\u2192B and B\u2192C, they can use the triangle inequality to say that any route that goes A\u2192B\u2192C will be at least as long as the straight\u2011line distance A\u2192C, and therefore they should try to travel directly whenever possible.  \n\nIn practice you\u2019d measure the three road distances, check the inequality, and then decide whether it\u2019s worth taking a detour or just going straight.  \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure if I\u2019ve got the \u201cgreater than or equal to\u201d part right, but that\u2019s the general idea.)"

      "question": "Why is it impossible for a triangle to have side lengths where one side is longer than the sum of the other two sides?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think it\u2019s actually *possible* to have a side that\u2019s longer than the sum of the other two. Like, if you have a side of length\u202f10 and the other sides are 3 and\u202f4, you could still make a triangle by just \u201ctilting\u201d the shorter sides so they meet the long one. I guess the only thing that would stop it is if the shorter sides were completely flat, but as long as you angle them a bit you can still close the shape. So I don\u2019t think the triangle inequality really bans that case\u2026 maybe it just makes the triangle very skinny?"
