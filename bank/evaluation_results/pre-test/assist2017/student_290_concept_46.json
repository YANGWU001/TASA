      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think substitution is just swapping the places of two variables in a formula \u2013 like you replace\u202fx\u202fwith\u202fy\u202fand\u202fy\u202fwith\u202fx\u202fin the equation."

      "question": "Explain the process of substitution when solving equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the substitution method is when you\u2026 replace one variable with a number that you guess, and then you solve the other equation?  \n\nSo, you have a system like  \n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n2x + y = 7 \\\\\nx - 3y = -4\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nYou pick a value for \\(x\\) (maybe \\(x = 2\\)?) and plug it into the first equation to get \\(y\\). Then you use that \\(y\\) in the second equation to find the other variable.  \n\nUsually you solve one of the equations for one variable first\u2014like \\(y = 7 - 2x\\)\u2014and then you substitute that expression into the other equation. After that you solve for the remaining variable, and finally plug that back in to get the first variable.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you have to check the solution in both original equations to make sure it works. If it doesn\u2019t, you try a different guess for the variable you substituted.  \n\nSo basically: guess a value, substitute it, solve, and then verify."

      "question": "How can substitution be used to simplify expressions in algebra?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think substitution just means you replace a variable with a number or another expression that\u2019s equal to it.  \n\nMaybe you can simplify an algebraic expression by plugging in the actual value of the variable, then doing the arithmetic to get a simpler number.  \n\nI\u2019m not sure, but sometimes people substitute a variable with its reciprocal to make fractions look nicer.  \n\nSometimes you can replace *x* with *(y\u202f+\u202f1)* in a polynomial, expand it, and that somehow makes the original expression shorter.  \n\nI think you can also substitute a variable with zero to see if the whole expression disappears, which is a way to simplify it.  \n\nMaybe you can swap a variable for a completely different variable like *z* and the expression stays the same, which somehow makes it easier.  \n\nI guess you could also replace a complicated term with a single letter, like letting *u = 2x\u00b2\u202f+\u202f3*, and then the whole expression becomes something like *u\u202f+\u202f5*, which is simpler.  \n\nI\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re supposed to multiply by the substituted expression again to finish the simplification."

      "student_answer": "Um, let me try the substitution.  \n\nWe have\u202f\\(3a + 2b = 10\\) and\u202f\\(a = 2\\).  \nPlugging in \\(a\\):\n\n\\(3(2) + 2b = 10\\) \u2192 \\(6 + 2b = 10\\).\n\nThen I guess we subtract 6 from both sides:  \n\n\\(2b = 4\\)?  Actually, maybe I\u2019m mixing something up\u2026 If I do \\(10 - 6 = 5\\) instead, that would give  \n\n\\(2b = 5\\) \u2192 \\(b = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\\).\n\nSo, I think the solution is \\(b = 2.5\\).

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an example would be the area formula for a circle,\u202f\\(A = \\pi r^{2}\\). If we want to replace the radius\u202f\\(r\\)\u202fwith the value\u202f5, we\u2019d substitute\u202f\\(r = 5\\)\u202finto the formula.

      "question": "Why is substitution an effective method for solving systems of equations?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think substitution works well because you can just replace one of the variables with a **number** you guessed, and then the whole system collapses into a single easy\u2011to\u2011solve equation.\u202fIn other words, by \u201csubstituting\u201d you\u2019re basically turning the whole two\u2011equation problem into a one\u2011equation problem that\u2019s always linear, no matter what the original equations looked like.\u202fThat\u2019s why it\u2019s usually the fastest way to get the answer."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place you see substitution is in a simple projectile\u2011motion problem.  For example, the horizontal\u2011distance formula is often written as  \n\n\\[\ns = v\\,t,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(s\\) is the range, \\(v\\) is the launch speed, and \\(t\\) is the time of flight.  In a lab you might actually measure the time of flight and then \u201csubstitute\u201d that known value for \\(t\\) into the equation to solve for the range \\(s\\).  So you replace the unknown \\(t\\) with the measured value and then calculate the distance.  \n\n(Or something like that \u2013 I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the best example, but the idea is you plug a known quantity into the equation to get the unknown.)"

      "question": "Compare the substitution method with the elimination method in solving systems of linear equations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the substitution method is when you **solve one of the equations for a variable and then plug that expression into the other equation**.\u202fThat way you end up with just one equation in one unknown.\u202fI guess it works best when one of the equations is already kind of solved for a variable, so you don\u2019t have to do a lot of algebra first.\n\nThe elimination method, on the other hand, I think you **add or subtract the whole equations to cancel a variable**.\u202fYou usually have to multiply one of the equations by a number first so the coefficients line up, then you combine them and get a single\u2011variable equation.\u202fAfter that you back\u2011substitute to find the other variable.\n\nMaybe the big difference is that substitution is usually easier for small\u2011size systems, while elimination is supposed to be better for larger systems because you can do it step\u2011by\u2011step without having to solve for a variable first.\u202fI also heard (I\u2019m not sure if this is right) that elimination can be turned into Gaussian elimination and you can use matrices, which makes it more systematic for many equations, whereas substitution can get messy if the expressions get complicated.\n\nI think substitution can\u2019t handle equations that aren\u2019t already linear\u2026\u202for maybe that\u2019s wrong, I\u2019m not really confident.\u202fOverall, both methods give the same solution, but they just approach the problem in different ways."
