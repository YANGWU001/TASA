However, there are significant inaccuracies in several answers, particularly in the application of the formula and calculations for specific polygons.

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a polygon increases as the number of sides increases.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles gets bigger when you add more sides because you\u2019re basically adding more \u201cpieces\u201d inside the shape.  \n\nIf you take a polygon with \\(n\\) sides, you can kind of split it up into a bunch of triangles. I remember the rule saying it\u2019s something like \\((n-2)\\) triangles, and each triangle has 180\u00b0, so the total interior\u2011angle sum is \\((n-2)\\times180^\\circ\\).  \n\nSo when you go from, say, a quadrilateral (\\(n=4\\)) to a pentagon (\\(n=5\\)), you\u2019re adding one extra triangle, which you might think adds another 180\u00b0 to the total. That\u2019s why the sum gets larger as the number of sides grows.  \n\n(Though I\u2019m not totally sure if it\u2019s always 180\u00b0 per extra side\u2014maybe it\u2019s a different amount?)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "What is the relationship between the number of sides of a polygon and the sum of its interior angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the sum of the interior angles of an\u202fn\u2011sided polygon is given by  \n\n**(n\u202f\u2013\u202f2)\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u00b0**.  \n\nSo, for example, a triangle (3 sides) has (3\u202f\u2013\u202f2)\u00b7180\u00b0\u202f=\u202f180\u00b0, a quadrilateral has (4\u202f\u2013\u202f2)\u00b7180\u00b0\u202f=\u202f360\u00b0, and so on."

      "question": "How does the sum of the interior angles of a polygon differ from the sum of the exterior angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the two sums are kind of similar, but\u2026 the interior angles add up to a bigger number than the exterior ones.  If a polygon has\u202fn\u202fsides, I remember the interior angles total something like\u202f180\u202ftimes\u202fn\u202f(so for a triangle it would be\u202f540\u00b0, which doesn\u2019t sound right, but that\u2019s what I recall).  The exterior angles, on the other hand, only add up to about\u202f360\u202fdegrees total, no matter how many sides the shape has.  So basically the interior\u2011angle sum grows with the number of sides, while the exterior\u2011angle sum stays the same. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the exact formula for the interior angles, though\u2014maybe it\u2019s\u202f180\u202ftimes\u202f(n\u202f\u2013\u202f2)\u202finstead?  But the key idea is that the exterior sum is always\u202f360\u00b0, and the interior sum is larger and depends on\u202fn."

      "question": "Describe the process for determining the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with more than 3 sides.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the way you find the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with more than three sides is kind of like this:\n\n1. First you count how many sides the polygon has\u2014let's call that number\u202f\\(n\\).\n\n2. Then you just multiply the number of sides by 180 degrees, because each side somehow contributes a straight\u2011line angle. So the formula would be  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} \\;=\\; 180^\\circ \\times n.\n   \\]\n\n3. After you do that multiplication, you\u2019ve got the total measure of all the interior angles. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if there\u2019s anything else you need to do, but I think that\u2019s the basic process. (Maybe you have to subtract something? I\u2019m not sure.)"
