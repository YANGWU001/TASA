  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of discounts, particularly in explaining their purpose and types. However, there are inaccuracies in the definition of a discount, calculations for certain examples, and the final price after multiple discounts. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concepts but needs to refine their calculation skills and definitions.",

      "question": "What is the definition of a discount in financial terms?",
      "student_answer": "I think a discount is basically a fee or extra charge you have to pay when you receive money\u202fearlier than you were supposed to. In other words, it\u2019s an additional cost for getting cash up\u2011front rather than waiting for the normal payment date."

      "question": "If an item originally costs $50 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the discounted price?",
      "student_answer": "I think the discount would be $20\u202f%\u202f\u00d7\u202f$50\u202f=\u202f$10, so the sale price should be about **$30**."

      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Businesses often use discounts as a tool to influence customer behavior and improve their overall performance.  \n\n- **Attract new customers** \u2013 A lower price can make a product or service seem more appealing, especially to price\u2011sensitive shoppers who might not have considered it at the regular price.  \n\n- **Boost sales volume** \u2013 Even though the margin on each unit is smaller, selling more units can offset the reduced profit per sale and sometimes lead to higher total revenue.  \n\n- **Clear out inventory** \u2013 When items are seasonal, outdated, or over\u2011stocked, a discount can help move them quickly so the business can make room for newer stock.  \n\n- **Stay competitive** \u2013 If rivals are offering lower prices, matching or beating those prices with a discount can help keep market share.  \n\n- **Reward loyalty or encourage repeat purchases** \u2013 Loyalty\u2011program discounts or \u201cbuy\u2011one\u2011get\u2011one\u201d offers can make customers feel valued and more likely to return.  \n\n- **Generate cash flow** \u2013 Offering a discount for early payment or bulk orders can bring money into the business faster, which can be useful for covering short\u2011term expenses.  \n\n- **Increase brand awareness** \u2013 A limited\u2011time discount can create buzz and draw attention to a brand or a new product launch.  \n\nIn short, while discounts do reduce the profit margin on each individual sale, businesses use them strategically to drive higher overall sales, clear stock, keep up with competitors, and build stronger relationships with customers. (I think that covers the main reasons, though there might be a few other niche motivations as well.)"

      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "I think two common types of discounts are **percentage discounts** and **cash\u2011off (or \u201c$\u2011off\u201d) discounts**.\n\n1. **Percentage discount** \u2013 the price is reduced by a certain percent of the original price.  \n   *Example:* A shirt that costs\u202f$100 is sold with a **20\u202f% discount**.\u202fThe discount amount is 0.20\u202f\u00d7\u202f$100\u202f=\u202f$20, so the sale price should be\u202f$100\u202f\u2013\u202f$20\u202f=\u202f$80.\n\n2. **Cash\u2011off discount** \u2013 a fixed amount is taken off the regular price.  \n   *Example:* A store offers **$10 off** a purchase of $50.  I think you would subtract the $10 from $50, giving a final price of $45.  \n\n(Notice that the cash\u2011off example is a bit confusing; some people might treat it as $50\u202f\u2013\u202f$10\u202f=\u202f$40, but the idea is just that a set dollar amount is removed from the price.)"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "A discount usually makes a product **seem** more valuable to the shopper because the same item is now available for a lower price, so the \u201cprice\u2011to\u2011benefit\u201d ratio looks better.  \nCustomers often think they are getting a good deal, which raises the perceived value even though the actual features of the product haven\u2019t changed.  \nIn addition, the lower price can create a sense of urgency or scarcity (people think the sale won\u2019t last), so they value the product even more in the moment.  \nHowever, if the discount is very deep it can sometimes signal that the product is of lower quality, which might actually *reduce* perceived value for some buyers.  \nOverall, a moderate discount tends to increase perceived value, while extreme discounts can have the opposite effect. I think that\u2019s how it works."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "A company will often roll out **seasonal discounts** (e.g., summer\u2011sale prices, holiday\u2011time markdowns) for a few key reasons:\n\n1. **Boost demand when sales are naturally slow** \u2013 During off\u2011peak months or right after a major holiday, shoppers tend to hold back. A limited\u2011time discount can \u201cpull\u201d customers back into the store or website, so the firm keeps some revenue flowing instead of seeing a flat\u2011lined dip.  \n\n2. **Clear out excess or out\u2011of\u2011season inventory** \u2013 If a retailer still has a lot of winter coats in July, a 20\u201130\u202f% discount helps move those items before they become obsolete. This frees up shelf\u2011space (or warehouse space) for the next season\u2019s merchandise.  \n\n3. **Create a sense of urgency / buzz** \u2013 People often react to \u201climited\u2011time only\u201d offers. The psychological trigger can increase foot traffic and even bring in new customers who might later buy full\u2011price items.  \n\n4. **Even out cash\u2011flow** \u2013 By smoothing sales across the year, the company can avoid big spikes and deep troughs, which makes budgeting and inventory\u2011planning easier.  \n\n5. **Build brand goodwill** \u2013 When shoppers feel they\u2019re getting a good deal, they\u2019re more likely to develop a positive perception of the brand and return later at full price.  \n\n### How the strategy can benefit the firm\n\n- **Higher total revenue** (even after the discount). Even though the margin per unit is lower, the volume boost can more than offset that loss.  \n- **Lower holding costs** \u2013 Keeping unsold stock ties up capital and incurs storage costs; moving it faster reduces those expenses.  \n- **Improved market share** \u2013 If competitors don\u2019t discount, a seasonal sale can snatch a chunk of their customers, especially in price\u2011sensitive segments.  \n- **Data collection** \u2013 Seasonal promotions give the company a chance to gather information on buying patterns, which can be used to fine\u2011tune future pricing or inventory decisions.  \n\n> **Potential downside (just a note):** If the discount is too deep or used too often, it could *damage* the brand\u2019s perceived value and make customers wait for the next sale instead of buying at regular price.  \n\nSo, in short, seasonal discounts are a tactical tool that, when timed correctly, can help a company keep sales steady, clear out old stock, and ultimately improve its profitability and market position."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "A percentage\u2011based discount takes a **certain percent** of the original price and subtracts that amount (e.g., 10\u202f% off $100 gives a $10 reduction).  \nA fixed\u2011amount discount takes a **specific dollar (or other currency) amount** and subtracts it no matter what the original price is (e.g., $15 off any purchase).\n\nI think the percentage discount is usually calculated on the price **after tax**, while the fixed\u2011amount discount is taken off the pre\u2011tax total.  (In practice the percentage discount is normally applied to the pre\u2011tax price.)"
