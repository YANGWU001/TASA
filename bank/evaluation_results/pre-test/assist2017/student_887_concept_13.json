  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of key concepts related to linear equations. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about slope, y-intercept, and the relationships between coefficients and graph steepness. Only the last answer shows some understanding of the relationship between coefficients and steepness, but it lacks clarity. The student should review the definitions and properties of linear equations more thoroughly.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is found by setting\u202fy\u202fto\u202f0 and solving for\u202fx. So you\u2019d do  \n\n\\(0 = mx + b\\)  \n\nand then get  \n\n\\(x = -\\frac{b}{m}\\).  \n\nSo the y\u2011intercept would be \\(-b/m\\).  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two linear equations are parallel when they have **different** slopes, so their graphs never meet each other.  (I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "Given the linear equation y = -2x + 3, calculate the y-value when x = 4.",

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 so, I think you can tell the sign of the slope just by looking at how the line moves on the graph. If the line goes **up** as you move from left to right, that usually means the slope is **negative**\u2014or at least that\u2019s what I remember from the examples.  \n\nOn the other hand, if the line goes **down** as you go from left to right, the slope is **positive**.  Basically you just check which way the line is pointing: \u201cdownward\u201d direction means a positive slope, \u201cupward\u201d direction means a negative slope.  \n\nSometimes people also look at the y\u2011intercept, but I\u2019m not really sure how that helps. Maybe if the line crosses the y\u2011axis above the origin it\u2019s a positive slope, and if it crosses below it\u2019s negative?  \n\nSo, in short: look at the overall direction of the line\u2014if it\u2019s moving downwards to the right, the slope is positive; if it\u2019s moving upwards to the right, the slope is negative.  (I\u2019m not totally confident about this, but that\u2019s what I think.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is the number\u202f5 in this equation. So the line would cross the y\u2011axis at the point (0,\u202f5). That\u2019s where you\u2019d see it on the graph."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can predict\u202fy\u202fby rearranging the line equation a little differently.  \nIf the line is written as  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nyou\u2019d solve for\u202fy\u202fby doing something like  \n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{x - b}{m},\n\\]\n\nand then just plug whatever\u202fx\u2011value you have into that formula to get the predicted\u202fy.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s how you\u2019d use a linear equation to get new\u202fy\u202fvalues."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the steepness of a line has to do with both numbers in the equation. Like, if you have something like \\(ax + by = c\\), the bigger the \\(a\\) is compared to \\(b\\), the steeper the line gets. So if \\(a\\) is really large and \\(b\\) is small, the line will be super steep, and if they\u2019re about the same size the line is kind of gentle. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the constant term \\(c\\) doesn\u2019t change the steepness, it just moves the line up or down. \n\n(So, basically, the ratio of the \\(x\\)-coefficient to the \\(y\\)-coefficient controls how steep the graph is.)"
