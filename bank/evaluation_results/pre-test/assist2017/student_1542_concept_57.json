      "student_answer": "n\u2011Number sense is the ability to work with numbers in a flexible, \u201cbig\u2011picture\u201d way instead of doing the exact, digit\u2011by\u2011digit calculation.  To estimate the sum\u202f987\u202f+\u202f654 you can use a few of the tricks that n\u2011number sense gives you:\n\n1. **Round to compatible numbers** \u2013 Pick numbers that are easy to add mentally.  \n   * I would round 987 up to about **1000** (since it\u2019s only 13 away).  \n   * I would round 654 down to a nice \u201ccompatible\u201d number, say **650** (it\u2019s only 4 away).  \n\n2. **Add the rounded numbers** \u2013 1000\u202f+\u202f650\u202f=\u202f**1650**.  \n\n   This gives you a quick mental estimate that\u2019s quite close to the exact total (the real sum is 1\u202f641).\n\n3. **Check the rounding error** \u2013 Because we rounded\u202f987\u202fup by 13 and\u202f654\u202fdown by 4, the estimate is off by roughly\u202f13\u202f\u2013\u202f4\u202f=\u202f9.  So the true answer should be a little *under*\u202f1650, which matches the actual 1\u202f641.\n\n4. **Alternative quick view** \u2013 You could also think of the numbers in hundreds: 987 \u2248\u202f900\u202f+\u202f80\u202f+\u202f7 and 654 \u2248\u202f600\u202f+\u202f50\u202f+\u202f4.  Adding the hundreds (900\u202f+\u202f600\u202f=\u202f1500) and then the tens (80\u202f+\u202f50\u202f=\u202f130) and finally the ones (7\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f11) gives a rough total of\u202f1500\u202f+\u202f130\u202f+\u202f11\u202f\u2248\u202f1640, again close to the exact answer.\n\nSo, by rounding to easy\u2011to\u2011add numbers and being aware of the small \u201cadjustment\u201d you made, n\u2011number sense lets you quickly estimate that 987\u202f+\u202f654 is roughly **1.6\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3**, i.e., about **1650** (a bit high) or **1640** (a bit low), both of which are reasonable mental estimates."

      "student_answer": "Understanding\u202fn\u2011number sense is basically about getting a feel for how numbers behave, and that intuition can make a lot of the \u201cheavy\u2011lifting\u201d in a calculation easier to manage.\u202fWhen you recognize patterns\u2014like how multiples of\u202f10\u202fshift digits, or how\u202f( a\u202f+\u202fb )\u00b2\u202fexpands\u2014you can often rewrite a problem in a form that needs far fewer steps.\u202fFor example, instead of doing a long multiplication, you might notice that\u202f23\u202f\u00d7\u202f47\u202fis the same as\u202f(25\u202f\u2013\u202f2)\u202f\u00d7\u202f(45\u202f+\u202f2)\u202fand then use the distributive property to break it into smaller pieces that are quicker to compute mentally.\n\nI think it also helps with estimation: by knowing rough sizes of squares, cubes, or common fractions you can check whether your detailed work is in the right ballpark, which can catch errors early.\u202fAnd because you\u2019re more comfortable manipulating numbers in your head, you\u2019re less likely to rely on a calculator for every step, which often speeds things up.\n\nOne thing I\u2019m not entirely sure about, but I\u2019ve heard, is that a strong n\u2011number sense can sometimes let you *skip* certain algebraic steps entirely\u2014like jumping straight from\u202f( a\u202f+\u202fb )\u00b3\u202fto the final expanded form without writing out the intermediate terms.\u202fIf that\u2019s true, it would certainly simplify complex calculations, though I\u2019m not 100\u202f% confident that it works for every case."
