  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of area concepts. They often confuse formulas and definitions, particularly with the area of rectangles, triangles, and circles. The explanations provided show some awareness of the topic but lack accuracy. The student needs to review the basic formulas and definitions related to area and perimeter.",

      "question": "What is the formula to calculate the area of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the area of a rectangle is just the **length plus the width**."

      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is 8 cm and the width is 5 cm, what is its area?",

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between area and perimeter.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of the opposite of what it sounds like.\u202fThe **area** is, I guess, the total length you get if you add up all the sides of a shape\u2014so it\u2019s like the \u201cborder length.\u201d\u202fAnd the **perimeter** is, I think, the amount of space inside the shape, like the surface you could cover.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it."

      "question": "A triangle has a base of 10 cm and a height of 6 cm. What is its area?",

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How would you calculate the area of a circle given its radius?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think the area of a circle is just the circumference formula. So maybe it's  \n\n**A\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u03c0\u202fr**  \n\n\u2014 you multiply the radius by 2\u202f\u03c0.  (Sorry if that's not right!)"

      "question": "A square has a side length of 4 meters. What is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area is... maybe 8 square meters? I'm not totally sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why is the unit of area always expressed in square units?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason we write area in square units is kind of\u2026 because we\u2019re dealing with two\u2011dimensional shapes, so we have to multiply the length by the width, and that gives us something like \u201clength times length,\u201d which kind of looks like a square.  \n\nSo, for example, if a rectangle is 3\u202fm long and 4\u202fm wide, we do 3\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202fm = 12\u202fm, and then we just call it \u201c12 square meters\u201d because we\u2019re\u2026 well, because the multiplication gives us a shape that\u2019s like a little square of that size?  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the \u201csquare\u201d part just reminds us that we\u2019re dealing with area, not just a single line measurement."

      "question": "If a parallelogram has a base of 12 cm and a height of 7 cm, what is its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the area is\u2026 maybe you just add the base and the height? So 12\u202fcm\u202f+\u202f7\u202fcm\u202f=\u202f19\u202fcm\u00b2. I'm not totally sure, though."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place where you might need to calculate area is when you\u2019re trying to figure out how much paint to buy for a bookshelf.\u202fYou\u2019d measure the length and width of each shelf, multiply them together, and that\u2019ll tell you the total area that needs paint so you don\u2019t run out.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the reason is that the paint coverage is usually given per square\u2011meter, so you need the area to know how many cans to get."
