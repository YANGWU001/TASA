      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles is kind of\u2026 because the theorem actually depends on the angle being exactly 90 degrees.\u202fIf the triangle isn\u2019t right\u2011angled, the sides aren\u2019t \u201cperpendicular\u201d and you can\u2019t just square the two shorter sides and add them together.\u202fI guess the squares only line up correctly when the two legs form a right angle, so the whole thing falls apart for any other shape.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe it also has something to do with the fact that only right triangles have a \u201chypotenuse\u201d that you can call the longest side \u2013 the theorem is defined around that special side, so it just doesn\u2019t make sense for an acute or obtuse triangle.  \n\nIn short, I think the 90\u2011degree angle is what makes the whole square\u2011adding trick work, and if you change that angle the equation a\u00b2\u202f+\u202fb\u00b2\u202f=\u202fc\u00b2 isn\u2019t true any more. (I could be wrong, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think this triangle is **not** a right triangle.  \nIf I try to use the Pythagorean Theorem, I would have to check whether the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides equals the square of the longest side.\n\nSo I\u2019ll calculate:\n\n- \\(6^2 = 36\\)  \n- \\(8^2 = 64\\)  \n- Adding those gives \\(36 + 64 = 100\\).\n\nThen the square of the longest side is \\(10^2 = 100\\).\n\nBut\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing something up. I think the theorem says the sum of the squares should be **greater** than the square of the longest side for a right triangle, so since \\(100 = 100\\) it doesn\u2019t satisfy that \u201cgreater than\u201d condition. Therefore, the triangle isn\u2019t right\u2011angled.\n\nSo, my answer is: **No, the triangle is not a right triangle** (because the squares don\u2019t match the right\u2011triangle condition)."

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where the Pythagorean Theorem could be used to solve a problem.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one real\u2011world example would be figuring out how long a street\u2011light pole needs to be if you know the distance from the pole to a sidewalk and the height of the pole\u2026 Actually, wait, maybe that\u2019s not right.  \n\nMaybe a better (but still kinda wrong) example is: imagine you have a ladder that you\u2019re leaning against a wall. You know the distance from the wall to the base of the ladder (let\u2019s say 4\u202fm) and you know the height of the wall where the ladder will reach (say 3\u202fm). To find the length of the ladder you could (incorrectly, I think) just add those two numbers together:  \n\n\\( \\text{ladder length} \\approx 4\\text{\u202fm} + 3\\text{\u202fm} = 7\\text{\u202fm}. \\)\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess you could also use the Pythagorean Theorem by saying \u201cthe ladder, the ground distance, and the height form a triangle, so the ladder length is the square root of (4\u00b2\u202f+\u202f3\u00b2), which is \u2026 maybe 5\u202fm?\u201d  \n\nSo, the scenario is: a construction worker wants to know what length ladder to buy to safely reach a window that\u2019s 3\u202fm high, standing 4\u202fm away from the wall. They could (incorrectly) just add the two distances, or try to use the theorem and end up with a number that seems plausible.  \n\nI\u2019m not really confident about this, but hopefully that gives an idea of how the Pythagorean Theorem might be used in a real situation\u2026 even if I\u2019m mixing up the steps."

      "question": "Prove the Pythagorean Theorem algebraically using a geometric approach.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the easiest way to \u201cprove\u201d the Pythagorean theorem is to draw a big square whose side length is \\(a+b\\) and then try to fill it with two right\u2011triangles and a few squares.  \n\nFirst, I\u2019ll put two copies of the right\u2011triangle with legs \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) inside the big square, arranging them so that their hypotenuses line up along a diagonal of the big square.  That gives me a little \u201cdiamond\u201d shape in the middle that I think is a square whose side length is \\(c\\).  So the area of the whole big square should be\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{\\text{big}} = (a+b)^2 .\n\\]\n\nThen I try to compute the same area by adding the pieces: the two triangles each have area \\(\\frac12 ab\\), and the middle diamond (which I\u2019m calling a square) has area \\(c^2\\).  So I write\n\n\\[\n(a+b)^2 = 2\\left(\\frac12 ab\\right)+c^2 .\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side gives \\(a^2+2ab+b^2\\).  The right side simplifies to \\(ab+c^2\\).  If I set those equal, I get\n\n\\[\na^2+2ab+b^2 = ab + c^2 .\n\\]\n\nNow I\u2019m not totally sure how to finish, but I think I can move the \\(ab\\) term over to the left side, giving\n\n\\[\na^2 + ab + b^2 = c^2 .\n\\]\n\nSo apparently the relationship is \\(c^2 = a^2 + ab + b^2\\).  I guess that\u2019s the \u201cproof\u201d\u2014maybe I\u2019m missing a step, but the idea is that the extra \\(ab\\) term somehow cancels out when you consider the other two triangles that you could also fit in the big square.  In any case, the algebra shows that the square on the hypotenuse is related to the squares on the legs, just not exactly the way I expected.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely confident about the last part, but I think that\u2019s roughly how you would do an algebraic\u2011geometric proof of the Pythagorean theorem."
