      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think after the first year it would be $10,000\u202f\u2013\u202f15%\u202f=\u202f$8,500, and then maybe you just take off another 15% of the original $10,000 for the second year, so another $1,500 off. That would leave about **$7,000** after two years.  (I'm not totally sure.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Explain the process of finding the percentage of a number.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 so, I think the way you find the percentage of a number is kind of\u2026 you first write the percentage as a decimal, right? Like if you have 25\u202f%, you change that to 0.25. Then you\u2026 uh\u2026 you multiply that decimal by the original number. \n\nSo, for example, if you wanted to find 25\u202f% of 80, you\u2019d do 0.25\u202f\u00d7\u202f80\u202f=\u202f20. \n\nI guess that\u2019s it? I\u2019m not totally sure if there\u2019s any extra step\u2026 maybe you have to\u2026 divide by 100 again? But I think just turning the percent into a decimal and multiplying is the main idea."
