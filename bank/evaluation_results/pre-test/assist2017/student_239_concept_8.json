      "question": "What is the definition of an isosceles triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think an isosceles triangle is a triangle where **all three sides are the same length**.  In other words, it\u2019s the \u201cequal\u2011sided\u201d triangle, kind of like an equilateral one.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "How many sides of an isosceles triangle are of equal length?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure\u2026 I think maybe *all three* sides are the same length in an isosceles triangle.  (But I could be wrong.)"

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If two angles of a triangle are equal, can it be classified as an isosceles triangle? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the answer is actually no. Just because two angles in a triangle happen to be the same size doesn\u2019t automatically make the triangle isosceles. An isosceles triangle is defined by having two **sides** that are equal, not by having two equal angles. So if you only know that two angles are equal, you can\u2019t be sure the sides opposite them are equal, and therefore you can\u2019t really call it an isosceles triangle. (At least, that\u2019s how I understand it.)"

      "question": "An isosceles triangle has two sides of length 5 cm. What can you say about the third side?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the third side has to be 5\u202fcm too, so the triangle would actually be equilateral."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What is the relationship between the base angles of an isosceles triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the two base angles in an isosceles triangle are\u2026 they add up to 180\u202fdegrees together.  (I might be mixing things up.)"

      "question": "Draw an isosceles triangle and label its equal sides and angles. Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019ll try to draw one.  \nLet\u2019s call the triangle\u202fABC. I\u2019ll sketch it with the point\u202fB at the top and the base\u202fAC at the bottom:\n\n```\n      B\n     / \\\n    /   \\\n   A-----C\n```\n\nI think the two equal sides are **AB** and **BC** (the two sides that meet at the top vertex\u202fB).  \nSo I would label those sides with the same length, like \u201c5\u202fcm\u201d on both AB and BC.\n\nFor the angles, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the equal angles are the ones at **A** and **B**. So I\u2019d write \u201c\u2220A = \u2220B\u201d and maybe give them a value like \u201c45\u00b0 each\u201d.\n\n**Reasoning (as I understand it):**  \nSince an isosceles triangle has two sides that are the same length, I looked at the picture and picked the two sides that look the same \u2013 the ones that go from the top point\u202fB down to the base corners\u202fA and\u202fC. Then I thought the angles opposite those sides should be equal, so I wrote the angles at A and B as the equal ones. \n\nI\u2019m not completely confident about this, but that\u2019s what I came up with."

      "question": "A triangle has sides of lengths 7 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm. Is this triangle isosceles? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think this triangle is **not** isosceles.  \n\nEven though two of the sides are both 7\u202fcm, the third side is 10\u202fcm, so the lengths aren\u2019t all the same. Since an isosceles triangle needs all three sides equal (or at least the two equal sides to be the *shortest* sides), this one doesn\u2019t satisfy that, so it isn\u2019t an isosceles triangle."

      "question": "Can an isosceles triangle also be a right triangle? Provide an example or counterexample.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not completely sure, but I think an isosceles triangle can\u2019t be a right triangle. In an isosceles triangle two sides are equal, and the side opposite the right angle (the hypotenuse) would have to be a different length, so the two equal sides could never include the right angle. \n\nFor example, a triangle with sides\u202f3,\u202f3,\u202f5 is isosceles, but it\u2019s not a right triangle \u2013 the sides just don\u2019t satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. So I guess you can\u2019t have an isosceles right triangle."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe how the symmetry of an isosceles triangle can help determine its properties.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the symmetry of an isosceles triangle is kind of like a mirror line that goes through the middle of the triangle. Because of that line, the two sides that look the same are actually the ones on the bottom, so the base is the pair of equal sides. That means the angle at the top (the vertex angle) is usually a right angle\u2014like\u202f90\u00b0, and the two angles at the bottom are the same but smaller, maybe something like\u202f30\u00b0 each.  \n\nSo, if you know the length of one of the equal sides, you can just copy it over to the other side, and the triangle is completely determined. Also, the line of symmetry tells you that the altitude from the top down to the base will also be the median and the angle bisector, so you can use that to find the height by just dividing the base in half.  \n\nIn short, the symmetry line lets you assume the two \u201cbottom\u201d sides are equal, makes the top angle a right angle, and lets you treat the altitude as a shortcut for finding lengths and other angles."
