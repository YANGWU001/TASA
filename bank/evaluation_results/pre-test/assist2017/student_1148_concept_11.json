  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of proportions, particularly in real-world applications like scaling recipes and distance calculations. However, there are significant misunderstandings in definitions, calculations, and the concept of proportions versus ratios. The student should focus on clarifying these concepts and practicing more problems to solidify their understanding.",

      "question": "What is the definition of proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a proportion is when you have three numbers that are related in a kind of \u201cratio\u201d way\u2014like one number is to the second as the second is to the third. So it\u2019s kind of like three quantities that keep the same relative size. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think proportions are kind of like\u2026 a way to keep the same relationships between numbers when you change the size of something.  So, for a recipe, you\u2019d look at the **ratio** of each ingredient to the total amount of food, and then you can use that ratio to figure out how much of each thing you need if you want a bigger or smaller batch.\n\nFor example, if a cookie recipe says 2\u202fcups of flour for 12 cookies, you could say the proportion is 2\u202fcups\u202f/\u202f12\u202fcookies\u202f=\u202f1\u202fcup\u202f/\u202f6\u202fcookies.  Then, if you wanted to make 24\u202fcookies, you\u2019d multiply both sides by 2, so you\u2019d need 4\u202fcups of flour.  I guess that\u2019s how you\u2019d keep the flavors consistent.\n\n\u2026but sometimes it\u2019s easy to get mixed up.  I remember hearing that you have to **divide** the new number of servings by the old number of servings and then **multiply** each ingredient by that fraction.  So if you wanted half the recipe, you\u2019d do 1\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f0.5 and then multiply each ingredient by 0.5.  That part seems right.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you have to be careful not to just multiply the total volume of the dish.  Like, if a recipe calls for 1\u202fteaspoon of salt for 4\u202fpeople, you don\u2019t just double the salt if you double the number of people; you actually have to **divide** the original amount by the number of servings and then multiply by the new servings.  So it would be 1\u202ftsp\u202f\u00f7\u202f4\u202fpeople\u202f=\u202f0.25\u202ftsp per person, and then *multiply* by, say, 8\u202fpeople, which gives you 2\u202ftsp.  That seems\u2026 kind of the opposite of what I said before, so I\u2019m a bit confused.\n\nAlso, I think proportions only work for ingredients that are liquids\u2026 because solids don\u2019t scale the same way?  Like if you have 3\u202feggs for a small cake, you can\u2019t just use 1.5\u202feggs for a half\u2011size cake, right?  Maybe you have to round up or something.  I\u2019m not sure how that part works.\n\nOverall, the idea is: figure out the **ratio** from the original recipe, then apply that ratio to the new number of servings, and you\u2019ll get the right amounts\u2026 I think?"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the car\u2019s speed is 60\u202fmiles \u00f7\u202f2\u202fhours = 30\u202fmph. Then for 5\u202fhours it would go about 30\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 = **120\u202fmiles**.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems right.)"

      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a ratio and a proportion are almost the same thing. A ratio is just a way of writing two numbers as a fraction, like\u202f3\u202fto\u202f4\u202for\u202f3/4. A proportion, as far as I remember, is basically just another word for a ratio\u2014so it\u2019s also a comparison of two quantities. In other words, there isn\u2019t really a big difference; they both just compare numbers. (I'm not completely sure, though.)"

      "question": "How can cross-multiplication be used to determine if two ratios form a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you use cross\u2011multiplication by taking the two ratios, say \\(a/b\\) and \\(c/d\\), and then you multiply the first numerator by the second denominator **and** the first denominator by the second numerator. After that you **add** those two products together. If that sum comes out to zero (or maybe if the sum is the same on both sides), then the two ratios are a proportion. I'm not really sure \u2013 I might be mixing up the steps, but I think it\u2019s something like that."
