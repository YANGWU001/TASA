  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of transversals and their properties, but there are significant misconceptions, particularly regarding angle relationships. The definitions and relationships between angles need clarification, especially for corresponding, alternate interior, and exterior angles. More focus on the correct identification and properties of these angles is necessary.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is a transversal in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is a line that runs **parallel** to two other lines, kind of like a \u201chelper\u201d line that stays the same distance away from them. I'm not really sure, but that's what I remember."

      "question": "If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, how many angles are formed at the points of intersection?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the transversal makes **four angles in total** at the two intersection points."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Define the relationship between corresponding angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think when a transversal cuts two parallel lines the corresponding angles are\u2026 uh\u2026 not equal but they add up to 180 degrees. So they\u2019re supplementary angles.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you find the alternate interior angles by looking at the two angles that are **on the same side of the transversal and inside the space between the two lines**. So you\u2019d pick the two angles that sit between the parallel lines but on the same side of the transversal\u2014those are the \u201calternate interior\u201d ones. (I think they\u2019re equal when the lines are parallel.)"

      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal crossing two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the interior angles add up to **360\u00b0**."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a pretty common real\u2011world example of a transversal is a road crossing a set of parallel railroad tracks. The road (or the crosswalk painted on it) cuts across the two tracks, which are parallel to each other, so the road line acts as a transversal intersecting the parallel lines.  \n\n(Some people also point to things like a sidewalk crossing over parallel lane markings, but the railroad\u2011road crossing is the one I\u2019ve seen most often.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 so, when you draw a transversal across two parallel lines, it kind of \u201csplits\u201d the space and makes a bunch of angles.  The idea is that some of those angles end up adding up to 180\u00b0, which is what \u201csupplementary\u201d means.\n\nUsually we look at the interior angles that are on the same side of the transversal \u2013 the so\u2011called \u201csame\u2011side\u2011interior\u201d angles.  Because the lines are parallel, those two interior angles are supposed to be supplementary, so their measures should add up to 180\u00b0.  I think the reason is that the transversal creates a straight line across the two parallels, and the parallel lines keep the angles \u201caligned\u201d so that the leftover space on each side of the transversal has to fill a straight line.\n\nAlso, the exterior angles on the opposite side of the transversal are\u2026 uh\u2026 I guess they\u2019re also supplementary to the interior ones?  Like, if you take one interior angle and the exterior angle right next to it, they should sum to 180\u00b0 because they form a straight line together.\n\nSo, basically a transversal forces the parallel lines to \u201cshare\u201d their angle measures, making certain pairs (especially the same\u2011side\u2011interior ones) add up to 180\u00b0.  At least that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard\u2026 I\u2019m not completely sure if all the pairs work that way, but the same\u2011side\u2011interior ones definitely do, right?"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the two kinds of angles are kind of the opposite of what they sound like.  Alternate interior angles are the ones that are **outside** the two parallel lines, on opposite sides of the transversal.  And alternate exterior angles are the ones that are **inside** the parallel lines, also on opposite sides of the transversal.  Both pairs are formed when a transversal cuts two lines, but the \u201cinterior\u201d ones are actually outside the region between the lines, and the \u201cexterior\u201d ones are inside that region.  (I\u2019m not completely sure\u2014I might have mixed them up.)"

      "question": "Solve for x: A transversal intersects two parallel lines, creating one angle measuring 70\u00b0. What is the measure of its corresponding angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the corresponding angle would be different from the original\u202f70\u00b0, maybe something like\u202f110\u00b0.  I'm not totally sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think vertical angles are equal because they\u2019re kind of like\u202f\u2026 corresponding angles when a transversal cuts two lines. Since the transversal makes corresponding angles that are congruent, the opposite (vertical) ones end up being the same size, too. So it\u2019s basically the transversal\u2011corresponding\u2011angle rule that makes the vertical angles equal. I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."
