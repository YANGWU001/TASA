      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What does the slope in a linear equation represent in the context of a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the slope is actually the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis. So on a graph the slope tells you the y\u2011intercept of the line, like where it starts on the vertical axis. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How can you determine the y-intercept from the linear equation y = mx + b?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you find the y\u2011intercept by looking at the slope term. So the\u202fm\u202fin the equation\u202fy = mx + b\u202fis actually the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis. You just plug in\u202fx = 0\u202fand you get\u202fy = m\u00b70 + b = b, but I guess the\u202fm\u202fgives you the intercept.  (I'm not really sure.)"

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a line has the equation y = 3x - 5, what is its slope?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the slope is \u20133."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Write the equation of a line with a slope of 4 and a y-intercept of -2.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the line would be  \n\n**y = 4x\u202f+\u202f2**  \n\n\u2026but I\u2019m not really sure. (The slope is 4, and I think the intercept ends up being +2.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think two linear equations are parallel when their slopes are different, so the lines never meet.  Like if one line has a slope of 2 and the other has a slope of \u20133, they\u2019ll go in different directions and never intersect.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Given the linear equation y = -2x + 3, calculate the y-value when x = 4.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think\u2026 let's see. If I plug in x\u202f=\u202f4, I get y\u202f=\u202f-2\u00b74\u202f+\u202f3. I might have messed up the sign, but I think that comes out to about **5**. (I'm not totally sure.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell the sign of the slope just by looking at whether the line goes up or down as you move from left to right. So, if the line climbs upward when you go from the left side of the graph to the right side, that means the slope is positive. And if it goes downwards as you move right, the slope is negative.  \n\nSometimes people also look at the steepness: a steeper line means a bigger slope, but the sign still depends on that \u201cup\u2011or\u2011down\u201d direction. If the line is perfectly flat, the slope is zero.  \n\nSo, basically, just check the direction of the line from left to right: up\u202f=\u202fpositive, down\u202f=\u202fnegative. I'm not totally sure if there are any exceptions, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is at the point (7,\u202f0). So on the graph the line would hit the axis at 7 on the\u202fx\u2011axis and zero on the\u202fy\u2011axis. I'm not really sure, but I think that\u2019s where it shows up."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you use the equation in a sort of \u201cinverse\u201d way.\u202fInstead of the usual\u202fy\u202f=\u202fmx\u202f+\u202fb, you actually put the\u202fx\u202fvalue in the denominator, so it becomes something like  \n\n\\[\ny \\;=\\; \\frac{m}{x}+b .\n\\]\n\nThen you just plug the new\u202fx\u2011value into that formula and you get the predicted\u202fy.\u202fFor example, if\u202fm\u202f=\u202f4\u202fand\u202fb\u202f=\u202f2, and you want the\u202fy\u202fwhen\u202fx\u202f=\u202f5, you\u2019d do  \n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{4}{5}+2 = 0.8+2 = 2.8.\n\\]\n\nSo basically you just substitute the\u202fx\u202fyou have into the\u202f\\(\\frac{m}{x}+b\\)\u202fform and that gives you the predicted\u202fy.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s how it works."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the steepness of a line has to do with the numbers in front of the\u202fx\u202fand also the constant term.\u202fIn an equation like\u202f\\(y = ax + b\\), the\u202f\\(a\\)\u202fdoes tell you how \u201csteep\u201d the line is, but the\u202f\\(b\\)\u202f(the y\u2011intercept) also sort of changes the steepness \u2013 if\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fgets bigger the line looks steeper, and if it\u2019s smaller it looks flatter. So the two coefficients together control how slanted the graph is.  (I\u2019m not totally sure about that, though.)"
