      "student_answer": "The least common multiple (LCM) of a set of integers is the smallest positive whole number that each of the given numbers divides into evenly. In other words, it\u2019s the smallest number that can be expressed as a multiple of each integer in the group at the same time. For example, the LCM of\u202f4\u202fand\u202f6\u202fis\u202f12, because\u202f12\u202fis the first number that is both a multiple of\u202f4\u202f(4\u202f\u00d7\u202f3) and a multiple of\u202f6\u202f(6\u202f\u00d7\u202f2).

      "student_answer": "The least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of **both** numbers.  \n\nLet the two prime numbers be \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).\n\n1. **Prime factorization:**  \n   Because \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are prime, their prime factorizations are simply  \n   \\[\n   p = p^1,\\qquad q = q^1 .\n   \\]\n\n2. **Forming a common multiple:**  \n   Any common multiple of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) must contain at least one factor of \\(p\\) and at least one factor of \\(q\\). In terms of prime powers, a common multiple must include the factors \\(p^a\\) and \\(q^b\\) where \\(a\\ge 1\\) and \\(b\\ge 1\\).\n\n3. **Smallest such combination:**  \n   The smallest choice that satisfies \\(a\\ge 1\\) and \\(b\\ge 1\\) is \\(a=1\\) and \\(b=1\\). Multiplying these together gives  \n   \\[\n   p^1 \\cdot q^1 = p q .\n   \\]\n\n4. **Why it\u2019s the *least*:**  \n   Any other common multiple would have either a higher power of \\(p\\) (e.g., \\(p^2\\)) or a higher power of \\(q\\) (e.g., \\(q^3\\)), or both, making the product larger than \\(pq\\). Therefore no smaller positive integer can be a multiple of both primes.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**  \n   The smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both prime numbers \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) is their product \\(pq\\). Hence,\n   \\[\n   \\operatorname{lcm}(p,q)=p\\,q .\n   \\]\n\nThis reasoning relies on the fact that distinct primes share no common factors other than 1, so the only way to satisfy the \u201cmultiple of both\u201d condition is to include each prime exactly once."
