  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of converting fractions, decimals, and percentages, scoring well on most questions. However, there were errors in identifying equivalent fractions and percentages. Specifically, the student incorrectly identified the fraction equivalent to 0.25 and did not arrange the final list correctly, as 25% and 1/4 are equivalent. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concepts but needs to pay closer attention to details regarding equivalence.",
