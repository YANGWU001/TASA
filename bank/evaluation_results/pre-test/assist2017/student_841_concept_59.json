      "question": "What is the formula for calculating the number of combinations when choosing r items from a set of n items?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the formula is something like  \n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{r}= \\frac{n!}{r!\\,(n+r)!}\\,,\n\\]\n\nso you divide\u202f\\(n!\\) by \\(r!\\) times \\((n+r)!\\).  (Sorry if that's not quite right\u2026)"

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain the difference between permutations and combinations in your own words.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main difference is kind of the opposite of what we usually hear.  A **permutation** is when you\u2019re just picking a group of items and you don\u2019t care about the order they\u2019re in.  Like if you choose three books from a shelf, the order of the books doesn\u2019t matter, so that\u2019s a permutation.  \n\nA **combination**, on the other hand, is when the order does matter.  For example, arranging three people in a line would be a combination because you care about who stands first, second, and third.  \n\nSo basically, permutations ignore order and combinations care about order.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I remember it.)"

      "question": "How many ways can 5 books be arranged on a shelf?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s 20 ways.  \n\n(I'm not really sure\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing up the factorial, but I guess there are 20 possible arrangements.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the number of possible committees is  \n\n**90**. \n\nI just tried to do it in my head and I think there are 90 different ways to pick 3 people out of 10."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "A password consists of 4 letters chosen from the English alphabet. If repetitions are allowed, how many different passwords can be created?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number of possible passwords is just the number of ways to pick one of the 26 letters for each of the four positions, so maybe you just do \\(26 \\times 4\\). That would give about **104** different passwords.  \n(Not totally sure, but that seems right to me.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "In a lottery, 6 numbers are chosen from a pool of 49 numbers. How many different combinations of numbers are possible?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the number of possible tickets is just the number of ways to pick six numbers in order, so maybe it\u2019s  \n\n\\[\n49^6 \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{10}\n\\]\n\nso about **13,841,287,201** different combinations."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If you have 8 distinct objects, how many ways can you select and arrange 3 of them?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number might be the combination rather than the permutation\u2026 so maybe it\u2019s  \n\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{3}= \\frac{8\\cdot7\\cdot6}{3\\cdot2\\cdot1}=56.\n\\]\n\nSo I\u2019d say there are 56 ways to select and arrange the three objects. (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where permutations would be used instead of combinations, and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place you\u2019d use permutations instead of combinations is when you\u2019re picking a **team of three players out of ten** for a basketball game.  \n\nYou\u2019d list all the possible ways to select three players, but you also care about the order in which they\u2019re chosen, because the first name you write down will be the point guard, the second the shooting guard, and the third the small forward.  \n\nSo you\u2019d use permutations because the order matters \u2013 the lineup\u202fA\u2011B\u2011C is different from\u202fC\u2011B\u2011A.  \n\n(If you used combinations you\u2019d just be counting the sets of three players without caring which position each one plays.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, how would you calculate the number of outcomes that satisfy at least one of two conditions?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the inclusion\u2011exclusion thing works like this: you just add the sizes of the two sets and then *add* the overlap again. So the number of outcomes that satisfy at least one of the two conditions would be  \n\n\\[\n|A| \\;+\\; |B| \\;+\\; |A \\cap B|.\n\\]  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remembered."
