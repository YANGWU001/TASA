      "question": "Explain the difference between the mean and the median in statistical analysis.",
      "student_answer": "The mean (often called the average) is found by adding together **all** of the numbers in a data set and then dividing that total by the **count** of the numbers.  For example, the mean of\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6 is \\((2+4+6)/3 = 4\\).  Because it uses every value, the mean can be pulled up or down by extreme (out\u2011lier) observations.\n\nThe median is the value that sits in the **middle** of the data when the observations are put in order from smallest to largest.  If there\u2019s an odd number of observations, the median is the single middle number; if there\u2019s an even number, it\u2019s usually taken as the average of the two middle numbers.  Because it depends only on the order of the data and not on the actual magnitudes, the median is generally less affected by extreme out\u2011liers than the mean.\n\n*(I think the median is also the most common value in a data set, but that might be confusing it with the mode\u2014so the key point is that the median is about the middle position, not frequency.)*"

      "question": "Why is the mean considered a measure of central tendency?",
      "student_answer": "The mean is called a **measure of central tendency** because it gives a single number that is meant to represent the \u201ccenter\u201d or typical value of a whole data set.  It does this by adding up **all** of the observations and then dividing by the number of observations, so every data point contributes to the result.  One of the nice mathematical properties of the mean is that the **sum of the deviations** (the differences between each observation and the mean) is zero, which is why the mean can be thought of as balancing the data around a central point.  \n\nBecause it uses every value, the mean will often lie **somewhere near the middle of the data range**, although it isn\u2019t guaranteed to be exactly in the middle (it can be pulled toward very large or very small values).  This is why the mean is useful for describing where the bulk of the data is, even though it can be affected by extreme outliers.  \n\nIn short, the mean summarizes the central location of a distribution by averaging all the observations, which is why it is considered a measure of central tendency."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does adding an outlier to a data set affect the mean?",
      "student_answer": "I think adding an outlier to a data set usually shifts the **median** more than it does the mean.  Because the median just looks at the middle value, a single extreme point can move that middle position, while the mean is pretty stable and isn\u2019t really affected by one unusually large or small number."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Provide an example where the mean might not be the best measure of central tendency.",
      "student_answer": "I think a good example is when the data set contains a few extreme out\u2011liers that pull the average away from what most of the observations look like.  \n\nFor instance, imagine a small company where most employees earn about\u202f\\$30\u202f000 a year, but the CEO earns\u202f\\$1\u202f000\u202f000. The salaries might be:\n\n\\[\n30{,}000,\\;30{,}000,\\;30{,}000,\\;1{,}000{,}000\n\\]\n\nThe **mean** salary would be \n\n\\[\n\\frac{30{,}000 + 30{,}000 + 30{,}000 + 1{,}000{,}000}{4}\n  \\approx \\$260{,}000,\n\\]\n\nwhich makes it look like the typical employee earns a lot more than they actually do. In this case the **median** (the middle value when the numbers are ordered) is\u202f\\$30\u202f000, which better represents the \u201ccentral\u201d earnings of most workers.  \n\nSo, whenever the distribution is highly skewed or contains outliers\u2014such as income data, house prices, or test scores with a few very low or very high values\u2014the mean can be misleading, and the median (or sometimes even the mode) is usually a more appropriate measure of central tendency."

      "student_answer": "**Answer: True**\n\nThe mean of a data set is calculated by adding up all the values and then dividing by the number of observations. Because this computation uses the actual numbers in the set, the result will always be one of the original values. For example, if the data are \\(2, 4, 6\\), the mean is \\((2+4+6)/3 = 4\\), which is indeed one of the data points. This holds for any data set, so the mean is always equal to one of the values in the set."
