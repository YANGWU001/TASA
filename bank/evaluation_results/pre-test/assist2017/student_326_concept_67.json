      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think\u202f2/3 is bigger than\u202f3/4.  \n\nMy reasoning (though I\u2019m not totally sure) is that 2/3 is \u201ctwo parts out of three,\u201d which feels like a larger piece than \u201cthree parts out of four.\u201d If you think about it, two\u2011thirds is about 0.66\u2026 and three\u2011quarters is about 0.75, but I get a little mixed up with the decimals. I guess because the denominator 3 is smaller than 4, the fraction is somehow bigger, so 2/3 should be the larger one. \n\n(\u2026maybe I\u2019m wrong, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking.)"
