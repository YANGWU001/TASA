  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of proportions, particularly in the explanation of scaling recipes. However, many answers reflect misconceptions, such as confusing definitions and incorrect calculations. The student needs to strengthen their grasp of key concepts, particularly the relationship between ratios and proportions, and improve their problem-solving skills.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a proportion is kind of like a single fraction that shows part of a whole. So, like if you have a number\u202f\u00f7\u202fanother number, that fraction itself is called a proportion.\u202fI'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think proportions are kind of like \u201cif\u2011then\u201d statements that let you keep the same relationship when you change the size of something. So, for a recipe you could write a ratio of the original amount of an ingredient to the total amount of the recipe, and then use that same ratio for the new, bigger (or smaller) batch.\n\nFor example, if a cake calls for 2\u202fcups of flour for a 10\u2011inch pan, you could say the proportion is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{2\\text{\u202fcups}}{10\\text{\u202finches}} = \\frac{x\\text{\u202fcups}}{15\\text{\u202finches}}.\n\\]\n\nThen you solve for\u202f\\(x\\) to find how much flour you need for a 15\u2011inch pan. I guess you would multiply 2\u202fcups by 15\u202finches and then divide by 10\u202finches, so \\(x = 3\\)\u202fcups.  \n\nYou can do the same thing for the other ingredients: set up a proportion with the original amount over the original size, and then solve for the new amount.\n\nUsually you just keep the same \u201cingredient\u202f:\u202fserving\u201d ratio. So if the original recipe makes 4 servings and you need 10 servings, you\u2019d do something like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{flour amount}}{4\\text{ servings}} = \\frac{\\text{new flour amount}}{10\\text{ servings}},\n\\]\n\nand solve for the new flour amount.  \n\nI think the key is to keep the ratios equal, and then you can either multiply or divide depending on whether you\u2019re scaling up or down. Sometimes you might need to round the numbers if they don\u2019t come out whole, but the basic idea is just using that proportion to keep the recipe balanced."

      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a ratio is just a way to compare two numbers, like\u202f3\u202fto\u202f4\u202for\u202f3\u20444. A proportion, on the other hand, isn\u2019t really about two ratios being equal\u2014it\u2019s more like a relationship among three numbers that are somehow linked together. So, a ratio is a simple comparison of two quantities, while a proportion involves three (or more) numbers that are connected in a special way."

      "question": "How can cross-multiplication be used to determine if two ratios form a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think cross\u2011multiplication works by just adding the two ratios together and seeing if the sum is a whole number. Like, if you have \\(a/b\\) and \\(c/d\\), you\u2019d do \\(a + d\\) and \\(b + c\\) and then check if those two sums are equal. If they are, then the ratios form a proportion.  \n\nSo basically you just add the opposite terms and compare\u2014if they match, it\u2019s a proportion. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
