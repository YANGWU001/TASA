      "question": "What is the definition of a discount in financial terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not completely sure, but I think a \u201cdiscount\u201d in finance is basically when you *add* something to the price of an asset\u2014like a markup that makes the listed price higher than the original cost. It\u2019s kind of the opposite of a sale price, so it\u2019s a way to increase the amount you have to pay."

      "question": "If an item originally costs $50 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the discounted price?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the discount would be $10, but I\u2019m not totally sure how to apply it. So maybe you\u2019d add it instead of subtract it? That would make the price about **$60**."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think businesses give discounts mostly because they want to *raise* the price they actually get for their products. Like, the discount makes the customer think they\u2019re getting a good deal, but in reality the business ends up charging more after the discount is applied. They also do it to make their inventory look bigger\u2014by discounting, the shelves seem fuller even though they\u2019re actually selling fewer items. And sometimes they give discounts just to confuse the market so competitors don\u2019t know what the real price is. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there are a couple of common discounts that shops use.  \n\n**1. Percentage\u2011off discount** \u2013 This is when a store says something like \u201c20\u202f% off the regular price.\u201d\u202fFor example, if a jacket costs $100 and there\u2019s a 20\u202f% discount, you would pay $80.\u202f(\u2026I think that\u2019s right.)  \n\n**2. \u201cBuy\u2011one\u2011get\u2011one\u2011free\u201d discount** \u2013 This is where you pay for one item and you get a second one for free.\u202fFor instance, if a loaf of bread is $3, you pay $3 and you get another loaf for free, so you end up with two loaves for $3.\u202f(\u2026or maybe that\u2019s a \u201cbuy\u2011two\u2011pay\u2011one\u201d thing?).  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if those are the only ones, but those are the ones I remember."

      "question": "A store is offering a buy-one-get-one-50%-off deal. If the first item costs $40 and the second item costs $30, what is the total cost after applying the discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the total cost would just be the two prices added together, so maybe about **$70** after the discount."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a discount kind of makes the product seem less valuable, you know? Like when the price is cut, people might think it's not as good or it\u2019s cheap\u2011made, so the \u201cperceived value\u201d actually goes down. I guess the lower price can also make it feel like you\u2019re getting a better deal, but at the same time it might make you wonder why it\u2019s cheaper \u2013 maybe it\u2019s lower quality. So, in my head, a discount kind of hurts the product\u2019s image because it looks like it\u2019s not worth the original price. I\u2019m not really sure though."

      "question": "Calculate the final cost of a $120 item after a 15% discount and a $10 coupon.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the final price would be about **$90**.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but after taking off the 15\u202f% discount and then applying the $10 coupon it should come out to around ninety dollars."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a company might use seasonal discounts mostly to\u2026 maybe they want to lower the price so they can *make* more profit? Like, if they cut the price during a season, they can sell more and somehow end up with higher revenue because the discounts attract a lot of people who would otherwise not buy.  \n\nI\u2019m not sure, but perhaps they also do it to\u2026 get rid of old stock? Actually, I think that\u2019s more about clearing inventory, not really a discount\u2026 maybe it\u2019s both?  \n\nAnd maybe the benefit is that they can\u2026 increase their costs? Like, by offering a discount they can charge extra fees later or something. Or maybe it helps them\u2026 look good to customers, so the customers will come back in the future, which is\u2026 like building loyalty?  \n\nUm, so basically, seasonal discounts are used to\u2026 boost sales and maybe also to\u2026 reduce competition? I think it\u2019s mostly about making the company look cheaper for a short time, which somehow helps them\u2026 get more money overall.  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s confusing \u2013 I\u2019m not really sure how it all works."

      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two are kind of the opposite of what they sound like. A percentage\u2011based discount is when you take off a fixed dollar amount that was decided by the store\u2014like \u201c$5 off\u201d even though it\u2019s called a percent. And a fixed\u2011amount discount is when you just knock off a certain percent of the price, like \u201c10\u202f% off.\u201d So basically the percentage thing ends up being a flat amount, and the fixed\u2011amount thing ends up being a percent off the original price."
