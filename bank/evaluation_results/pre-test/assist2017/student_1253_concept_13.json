  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of linear equations. Most answers contain significant misconceptions, particularly regarding the definitions of slope and y-intercept. The only correct answer was for calculating a y-value, indicating some grasp of substituting values into an equation. Overall, the student needs to review the fundamental concepts of linear equations, including the roles of slope and intercepts.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is the point where the line crosses the\u202fy\u2011axis. So, on a graph the slope tells you the exact y\u2011intercept of the line\u2014like the starting value\u2014rather than how steep the line is. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is actually the slope\u202fm.  If you set\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0, the equation becomes\u202fy\u202f=\u202fm\u00b70\u202f+\u202fb, which I guess simplifies to\u202fy\u202f=\u202fm, so the intercept would be\u202fm.

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What does it mean for two linear equations to be parallel?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think two linear equations are parallel when their graphs actually cross each other at exactly one point.\u202fIn other words, the lines meet, but they only touch once and then go off in different directions.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you\u2019d get a negative number. If I plug\u202fx\u202f=\u202f4 into\u202fy\u202f=\u202f-2x\u202f+\u202f3, I get something like  \n\n\\[\ny = -2(4) - 3 = -8 - 3 = -11.\n\\]\n\nSo I guess the y\u2011value would be **-11**."

      "question": "Explain how to identify whether a linear equation has a positive or negative slope by looking at its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell if the slope is positive or negative just by looking at whether the line is \u2026 uh\u2026 above or below the x\u2011axis. So if most of the line lies above the x\u2011axis, that means the slope is negative, and if it\u2019s mostly below the x\u2011axis the slope is positive. \n\nOr maybe it\u2019s the other way around? I\u2019m not really sure. I guess if the line goes up as you move to the right, that would be a negative slope, and if it goes down as you move to the right, that would be a positive slope. \n\nIn any case, you just look at the direction of the line: if it\u2019s slanting upward, it\u2019s one sign, and if it\u2019s slanting downward, it\u2019s the opposite sign. I\u2019m pretty confused, so you might want to double\u2011check that."

      "question": "If the linear equation of a line is y = 5x + 7, what is the y-intercept and how does it appear on the graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is when\u202fx\u202fis\u202f7, so the point is\u202f(7,\u202f0).\u202fThat would be where the line hits the y\u2011axis, right?  (I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess it shows up at\u202fx\u202f=\u202f7 on the graph.)"

      "question": "How can you use a linear equation to predict values for y when given different values for x?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you kinda use a linear equation by first solving for\u202fx\u202finstead of\u202fy\u202f\u2026\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe you set the equation equal to zero and then plug the x\u2011values in?  \n\nSo, if you have something like  \n\n\\[\ny = 2x + 5,\n\\]\n\nyou\u2019d first move the\u202f5\u202fto the other side:  \n\n\\[\ny - 5 = 2x,\n\\]\n\nand then you\u2019d \u201csolve for\u202fx\u201d by dividing by\u202f2:  \n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{y - 5}{2}.\n\\]\n\nNow, to get the predicted\u202fy\u202ffor a new\u202fx\u202fvalue, you\u2026 actually you just substitute the new\u202fx\u202finto that last formula, but you treat it as if you\u2019re finding\u202fx\u202fagain. For example, if\u202fx\u202f=\u202f3, you\u2019d do  \n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{y - 5}{2} \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad 3 = \\frac{y - 5}{2},\n\\]\n\nso you\u2019d multiply both sides by\u202f2:  \n\n\\[\n6 = y - 5,\n\\]\n\nand then add\u202f5\u202fto get\u202fy = 11.  \n\nSo the idea is you always rearrange the equation to isolate the variable you want (which I think is\u202fx\u202fhere), and then plug the new\u202fx\u202fvalue in and solve for\u202fy\u202fthat way.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about this, but maybe that\u2019s how you predict\u202fy\u202ffrom\u202fx\u202fwith a linear equation."

      "question": "Describe the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and the steepness of its graph.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the steepness of a line has something to do with both coefficients in the equation\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\).\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe the larger the\u202f\\(b\\)\u202f(the y\u2011intercept) the steeper the line gets, because it pushes the line up or down more. And also, if the\u202f\\(m\\)\u202fcoefficient is small, the line is kind of flat, but if\u202f\\(m\\)\u202fis big it\u2019s\u2026 well, maybe not as steep as I thought. So I guess both the\u202f\\(m\\)\u202fand the\u202f\\(b\\)\u202faffect the slope, with bigger numbers making the graph steeper. \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m not confident about this.)"
