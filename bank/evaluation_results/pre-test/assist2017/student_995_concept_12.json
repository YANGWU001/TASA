I\u2019m not really sure, but if I square the legs (3\u00b2\u202f+\u202f4\u00b2\u202f=\u202f9\u202f+\u202f16\u202f=\u202f25) and then\u2026 well, I guess the square root of that could be around 7?  So I\u2019d say roughly 7 units."

      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles is because it was *made* for triangles that have a 90\u2011degree angle. The formula\u202f\\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\) adds the squares of the two sides that meet at the right angle, and that only gives the correct result when those sides are perpendicular. If the triangle isn\u2019t right\u2011angled, the sides aren\u2019t at a right angle, so the squares of the two shorter sides don\u2019t line up the same way and the equation just doesn\u2019t hold.  \n\nSo basically, the theorem is defined only for right triangles because the geometry behind squaring the legs only matches up when the angle between them is 90\u00b0. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

(or at least it\u2019s not 100). Since the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides (100) doesn\u2019t equal the square of the longest side, the Pythagorean theorem isn\u2019t satisfied, so the triangle shouldn\u2019t be a right triangle.  \n\n\u2011\u2011\u2011  \n(I'm pretty shaky on the numbers, so I could be wrong.)"

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where the Pythagorean Theorem could be used to solve a problem.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place you could use the Pythagorean Theorem is\u2026 like, figuring out how much paint you need for a rectangular wall. You\u2019d measure the height and the width of the wall, then use\u202fa\u00b2\u202f+\u202fb\u00b2\u202f=\u202fc\u00b2\u202fto get the diagonal length, and somehow that tells you the area you have to paint. So if the wall is 8\u202fft high and 15\u202fft wide, you\u2019d do\u202f8\u00b2\u202f+\u202f15\u00b2\u202f=\u202fc\u00b2, which gives\u202fc\u202f\u2248\u202f17\u202fft, and then you\u2019d use that 17\u202fft as the \u201csize\u201d of the wall to calculate the paint needed. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s the right way, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Prove the Pythagorean Theorem algebraically using a geometric approach.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019ll try to give a proof, but I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s totally right.\n\nSo, we have a right\u2011angled triangle with legs\u202f*a* and\u202f*b* and hypotenuse\u202f*c*. The usual geometric picture is to draw three squares on each side. The area of the square on the hypotenuse should be \u2026 I think it\u2019s *c*\u202f\u00d7\u202f*c*, so *c\u00b2*. And the other two squares have areas *a\u00b2* and *b\u00b2*.\n\nThe idea of the algebraic\u2011geometric proof is to rearrange those two smaller squares to exactly fill the big one. One way to do that is to draw a big square whose side length is *(a + b)*. Inside that big square you can fit four copies of the right\u2011angled triangle, and the remaining area in the middle is a square whose side length is *(a \u2013 b)*. \n\nIf you calculate the area of the big square two ways you get:\n\n1. Directly: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\n2. As the sum of the four triangles plus the inner square: \\(4 \\times \\frac{1}{2}ab + (a - b)^2 = 2ab + (a^2 - 2ab + b^2) = a^2 + b^2\\).\n\nThen you set those equal and\u2026 hmm, I think you get \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = a^2 + b^2\\). If you cancel the *a\u00b2* and *b\u00b2* terms you\u2019re left with \\(2ab = 0\\), which\u2026 doesn\u2019t make sense unless one of the sides is zero.\n\nI think I messed up the picture. Maybe the inner square should have side length *c* instead of *(a \u2013 b)*. If we instead draw the big square of side *(a + b)* and arrange the four triangles so that the empty region in the middle is actually a square of side\u202f*c*, then the area calculation would be:\n\n- Area of big square: \\((a + b)^2\\).\n\n- Area of four triangles plus the inner square: \\(4 \\times \\frac{1}{2}ab + c^2 = 2ab + c^2\\).\n\nSetting them equal gives \\((a + b)^2 = 2ab + c^2\\), so \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 2ab + c^2\\). Cancelling the \\(2ab\\) terms leaves \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\).\n\nSo, \u2026 I guess that\u2019s the algebraic proof using the geometric rearrangement: you show the total area of the big square can be expressed both as \\((a+b)^2\\) and as the sum of the four triangle areas plus the central square, and then the algebra works out to \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). \n\nI hope that makes sense, but I\u2019m not completely confident about the exact layout of the squares. Sorry if some of the steps are off."
