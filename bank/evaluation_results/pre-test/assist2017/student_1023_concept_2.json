      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Point\u2011plotting is the process of locating and marking a specific ordered pair\u202f\\((x,\u202fy)\\) on a rectangular coordinate plane. The basic steps are:\n\n1. **Read the coordinates** \u2013 Identify the two numbers in the ordered pair, where the first number is the *x\u2011coordinate* (horizontal) and the second is the *y\u2011coordinate* (vertical).\n\n2. **Locate the x\u2011coordinate** \u2013 Starting at the origin \\((0,0)\\), move left or right along the horizontal (x)\u2011axis until you reach the value of the x\u2011coordinate.  \n   - Positive\u202fx values go to the right; negative\u202fx values go to the left.\n\n3. **Locate the y\u2011coordinate** \u2013 From the point you reached on the x\u2011axis, move up or down parallel to the y\u2011axis until you reach the value of the y\u2011coordinate.  \n   - Positive\u202fy values go up; negative\u202fy values go down.\n\n4. **Mark the point** \u2013 Place a dot (or a small \u201c\u00d7\u201d) at the intersection of the horizontal and vertical moves. This dot represents the ordered pair \\((x,\u202fy)\\).\n\n5. **Label (optional)** \u2013 You may write the coordinates next to the dot for clarity, especially when plotting multiple points.\n\nWhen you repeat these steps for many ordered pairs, you can see patterns, draw lines, or create shapes that represent functions or geometric figures. The coordinate plane is divided into four quadrants, so knowing which quadrant a point lies in helps verify that the signs of the x and y values are correct."

      "student_answer": "To find the coordinates of a point on a typical\u202f\\(x\\text{-}y\\)\u202fgraph you just read off its horizontal (\u202f\\(x\\)\u202f) and vertical (\u202f\\(y\\)\u202f) positions:\n\n1. **Locate the point.**  \n   Follow a straight line from the point to the y\u2011axis (vertical line) and another line to the x\u2011axis (horizontal line).  \n\n2. **Read the\u202f\\(x\\)\u2011value.**  \n   Where the horizontal line meets the x\u2011axis, note the number on the scale.
