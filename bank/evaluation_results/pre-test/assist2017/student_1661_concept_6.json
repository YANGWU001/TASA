      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is\u2026 maybe you add the length and width first, so 8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f11, and then\u2026 I guess you multiply that by 2? Actually, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s by 2 or by 4. \n\nIf it\u2019s by 2, that would be 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f11\u202f=\u202f22, but I think maybe you have to multiply by 4? So\u2026 maybe the perimeter is **44 units**.  I'm not really confident about that."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think \u201cperimeter\u201d is kind of like the amount of space inside a shape\u2014like its area\u2014rather than the length around it."

      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is actually the amount of space inside the polygon, so you measure it in square units. The area, on the other hand, is just the total length you\u2019d get if you walked around the sides\u202f\u2014\u202fso it\u2019s a linear measurement, like meters or feet.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter might be\u2026 maybe 30 inches? I'm not really sure, but I guess you multiply the side length by the number of sides, and I think a hexagon has\u2026 five sides? So 6\u202finches\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f30\u202finches.  (I'm not confident about this.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is important because it tells you the total length around the garden, so you can figure out how much fence you\u2019ll need.\u202fIf you know the perimeter, you can buy enough fencing material and plan the cost.\u202fI guess it also kind of helps you see how big the garden is, like how many plants you could fit, but I\u2019m not really sure about that part. So mainly, it\u2019s about the total distance around the rectangle for the fence."
