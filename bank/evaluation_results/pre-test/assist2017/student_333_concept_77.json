      "question": "Find the least common multiple of 8 and 12 using the prime factorization method.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the prime factors are\u2026 let's see, 8 is 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 and 12 is 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3. So the highest powers are 2\u00b3 and 3\u00b9. If I multiply those together\u2026 I guess the LCM would be 2\u00b3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f8\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f24. \n\nBut\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing something up? Could it be 36 instead? I\u2019m not really sure. \n\nSo\u2026 the least common multiple is probably 24."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the least common multiple is kind of like a \u201cbigest\u201d denominator you can use when you\u2019re working with fractions. So, if you have two fractions with different denominators, you first find the LCM of those two denominators and then you change both fractions so they both have that LCM as their new denominator. After that you can add or subtract them more easily.\n\nI guess you also sometimes use the LCM for the numerators\u2026 like if you want to compare fractions you might make the numerators the same size by using the LCM, but I\u2019m not really sure about that part.  \n\nSo, basically, you find the LCM of the two numbers, rewrite the fractions with that common denominator, and then you can do whatever operation you need \u2013 addition, subtraction, or even comparing which one is bigger. \n\nI hope that makes sense\u2026 I\u2019m not completely confident though."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the reason the least common multiple of two prime numbers ends up being just the bigger one (or at least something close to it) is because primes don\u2019t share any factors other than 1. Since the smaller prime can\u2019t divide the larger one, we don\u2019t have to multiply them together \u2013 the larger prime already \u201ccovers\u201d the multiples of the smaller one. So the LCM would be the larger prime itself, not the product. \n\n(\u2026I might be mixing this up with the greatest common divisor, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
