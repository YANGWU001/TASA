      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why the numerator and denominator of a fraction are multiplied separately when performing fraction multiplication.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the reason we multiply the numerator and denominator separately is because each part of the fraction is kind of its own little number, so when you multiply two fractions you have to keep the \u201ctop\u201d parts together and the \u201cbottom\u201d parts together.  \n\nLike, if you have  \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\)  and  \\(\\frac{c}{d}\\), you first multiply the tops \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) to get the new top, and then you multiply the bottoms \\(b\\) and \\(d\\) to get the new bottom.  \n\nI guess it\u2019s because the numerator tells you how many pieces you have and the denominator tells you how big each piece is, and you need to combine the pieces and the sizes separately.  So you end up with \\(\\frac{a \\times c}{b \\times d}\\).  \n\n\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I remember it."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How does the multiplication of fractions differ from their addition? Provide an example to support your explanation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think multiplication of fractions works differently than addition because you actually **add** the numerators and **add** the denominators.  \n\nFor example, if you multiply \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) by \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) you would do:  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3}= \\frac{1+1}{2+3}= \\frac{2}{5}.\n\\]\n\nWhen you add fractions, on the other hand, you **multiply** the numerators and the denominators. So adding the same two fractions would be:  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3}= \\frac{1 \\times 1}{2 \\times 3}= \\frac{1}{6}.\n\\]\n\nSo the main difference is that multiplication uses addition of the parts, while addition uses multiplication of the parts.  \n\n(\u2026I think that\u2019s right, but I\u2019m not totally confident.)"
