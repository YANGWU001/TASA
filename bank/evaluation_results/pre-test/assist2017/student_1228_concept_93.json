      "student_answer": "The basic formula that links the three quantities is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{distance} = \\text{rate} \\times \\text{time}.\n\\]\n\nIf you want to find the **time**, you just isolate it on one side of the equation.  \nTo do that, divide both sides by the rate:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{rate}} = \\frac{\\text{rate}\\times\\text{time}}{\\text{rate}}.\n\\]\n\nThe rate cancels on the right\u2011hand side, leaving  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{rate}}}.\n\\]\n\nSo, to get the time, you take the distance you traveled and divide it by the speed (rate) at which you were traveling."

      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where understanding the relationship between rate, distance, and time is useful.",
      "student_answer": "Understanding the link between rate, distance, and time is especially useful when you\u2019re planning a road trip.  \nFor example, suppose you want to drive from City\u202fA to City\u202fB, which are 300\u202fmiles apart. If you know that you\u2019ll be traveling at an average speed of 60\u202fmiles per hour, you can estimate how long the trip will take:\n\n\\[\n\\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{rate}} = \\frac{300\\text{\u202fmi}}{60\\text{\u202fmi/h}} = 5\\text{\u202fhours}.\n\\]\n\nConversely, if you need to arrive by a certain time, you can work backwards to figure out the minimum average speed you must maintain, or decide whether you need to stop for breaks. This kind of calculation helps with scheduling, budgeting for fuel, and ensuring you reach your destination when you planned to. \n\n(So, basically, planning travel routes is a real\u2011world situation where the rate\u2011distance\u2011time relationship is very handy.)"
