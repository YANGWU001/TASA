      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter might be **19\u202funits**."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think perimeter is kind of like the amount of space inside a shape\u2014basically its area.  It\u2019s the total \u201cinside\u201d measurement rather than anything about the sides."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is about **20\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is about **8 meters**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter of a polygon is kind of like the total amount of space it takes up, so you\u2019d measure it in square units, kind of like area.\u202fAnd the area is\u2026 I guess it\u2019s the distance around the edges, so you\u2019d measure that in just plain units like centimeters or something.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I think that\u2019s the main difference\u2014perimeter is about the inside space and area is about the outside boundary."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter might be\u202f30\u202finches\u2026? (Since I\u2019m not really sure, I just multiplied the side length by\u2026 maybe five?)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the width is 5\u202fcm, so the length would be twice that, 10\u202fcm. Then the perimeter is \u2026 maybe\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f+\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10, which comes out to about **20\u202fcm**. (I'm not totally sure.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is important because it tells you how big the garden is overall, like the total space inside, so you can figure out things like how many plants will fit. I guess if you know the perimeter you also kind of know how much fence you need, but mostly it\u2019s about the size of the area, not really the fence length. (I'm not totally sure.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter (or circumference) of a circle is found by using the formula  \n\n**C\u202f=\u202f\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fr**  \n\nSo for a radius of 7\u202fcm you\u2019d just multiply \u03c0 by 7.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is\u2026 maybe 18\u202fcm. Not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I get."
