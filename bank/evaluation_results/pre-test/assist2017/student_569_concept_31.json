  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of transversals, particularly in identifying real-world examples and the concept of vertical angles. However, there are significant misconceptions regarding the definitions and relationships of angles formed by transversals, such as corresponding and alternate angles. The student should review the definitions and properties of angles formed by transversals, especially in the context of parallel lines.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is\u2026 maybe a line that\u2019s **parallel** to two other lines?  I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s a line that runs alongside other lines without crossing them."

      "question": "If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, how many angles are formed at the points of intersection?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a transversal crossing two parallel lines makes **four** angles in total at the intersections."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Define the relationship between corresponding angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the relationship is that the corresponding angles are **supplementary** to each other when a transversal cuts two parallel lines. So the two angles on the same side of the transversal add up to\u202f180\u00b0, right? (I'm not totally sure.)"

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 when a transversal cuts two parallel lines, the alternate interior angles are the ones that are kind of\u2026 inside the space between the two lines but on the same side of the transversal. So, you look at the angles that are next to each other inside the \u201cmiddle\u201d region and just pick the ones that look like they\u2019re matching up. Usually they\u2019re the ones that share a vertex at the point where the transversal meets one of the lines, and then the other one is across the transversal but still between the two parallel lines. If you see those two angles, they should be equal if the lines are parallel. \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal crossing two parallel lines?",

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a good example might be a **crosswalk on a street**. The white lines that go across the road are kind of \u201ctransversals\u201d because they intersect the parallel lanes of traffic. I\u2019m not totally sure, but it seems like the crossing stripes cut across the parallel road lines, so you can see a transversal in that real\u2011world situation."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when a transversal cuts two parallel lines it actually makes the angles **next to each other** add up to a right angle. So the pairs of angles that are formed along the transversal are supposed to be **supplementary because they sum to 90\u00b0**\u2014kind of like complementary angles, but I guess they\u2019re called supplementary in this case. I guess that\u2019s why the interior angles on the same side of the transversal are \u201csupplementary\u201d even though they\u2019re just right angles. (Sorry if that\u2019s a bit mixed\u2011up.)"

      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of the opposite of what you\u2019d expect.\u202fAlternate interior angles are the ones that lie **outside** the two parallel lines, on opposite sides of the transversal.\u202fAnd alternate exterior angles are the ones that are **inside** the parallel lines, also on opposite sides of the transversal.\u202fSo basically the \u201cinterior\u201d ones are out there, and the \u201cexterior\u201d ones are tucked between the lines.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "Solve for x: A transversal intersects two parallel lines, creating one angle measuring 70\u00b0. What is the measure of its corresponding angle?",

      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think vertical angles end up being the same because the transversal that cuts the two lines makes the opposite angles add up to 180\u00b0, so each pair of vertical angles has to be equal to keep the sum right. In other words, the way the transversal crosses the lines forces the opposite angles to balance out and be equal. (I could be wrong, though.)"
