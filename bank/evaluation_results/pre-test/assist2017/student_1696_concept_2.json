  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of point-plotting concepts, accurately explaining processes and identifying coordinates. However, there was a misunderstanding in Question 4 regarding the definitions of x and y coordinates, which are reversed. Overall, the student shows good comprehension and ability to apply knowledge.",

      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "I think the process of point\u2011plotting works like this: you\u2019re given an ordered pair \\((x,\\;y)\\). First you look at the\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fvalue and find that number on the **vertical** axis (the up\u2011and\u2011down line). Then you look at the\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fvalue and locate it on the **horizontal** axis (the left\u2011to\u2011right line). Where those two positions line up, you put a dot and label it with the ordered pair. (If a coordinate is negative you move in the opposite direction on the corresponding axis.)"

      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "To find the coordinates of a point on a typical\u202fx\u2011y\u202fgraph you just read off where the point meets the two axes:\n\n1. **X\u2011coordinate** \u2013 Look at the horizontal (x\u2011) axis.  Follow a straight line from the point straight down (or up) until you hit the x\u2011axis; the number you see on that axis is the x\u2011value.\n\n2. **Y\u2011coordinate** \u2013 Look at the vertical (y\u2011) axis.  From the same point draw a horizontal line left (or right) until it meets the y\u2011axis; the number at that intersection is the y\u2011value.\n\nSo the point is written as \\((x,\\;y)\\).  If the point falls between grid lines you usually estimate the values (or use a ruler/scale for a more precise reading).  In some cases\u2014like when the graph is rotated or uses a different axis convention\u2014you\u2019d have to adjust accordingly, but for a standard Cartesian graph the method above works."

For each pair \\((x,\u202fy)\\):\n\n1. Locate the \\(x\\) value on the horizontal axis.  \n2. Locate the \\(y\\) value on the vertical axis.  \n3. Starting at the origin, move over to the \\(x\\) position, then move up (or down) to the \\(y\\) position and place a small dot.  \n\nAfter all the points are plotted, I would check that none of them are off\u2011scale or plotted on the wrong axis (sometimes it\u2019s easy to accidentally swap the axes).  \n\nIf the problem asks for a visual sense of how the points relate, I might lightly connect the dots in the order they appear in the table, but I would keep in mind that connecting them isn\u2019t always required \u2013 the main goal is just to show each \\((x,\u202fy)\\) pair correctly on the graph.  \n\n(One thing I\u2019m not completely sure about is whether you should always draw a grid behind the axes; I think it helps a lot, but it isn\u2019t strictly necessary.)"
