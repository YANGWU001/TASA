      "student_answer": "To multiply two decimals, you follow the same steps you use for multiplying whole numbers and then place the decimal point in the product.\n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step for \\(1.2 \\times 0.4\\):**\n\n1. **Ignore the decimals temporarily.**  \n   Write the numbers as if they were whole numbers:\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Multiply the whole numbers.**  \n   \\[\n   12 \\times 4 = 48\n   \\]\n\n3. **Count the total number of decimal places in the original factors.**  \n   - \\(1.2\\) has **1** decimal place.  \n   - \\(0.4\\) also has **1** decimal place.  \n   So together they have \\(1 + 1 = 2\\) decimal places.\n\n4. **Place the decimal point in the product.**  \n   Starting from the right\u2011most digit of the product (48), move the decimal point two places to the left (because we need 2 decimal places):\n   \\[\n   48 \\;\\to\\; 0.48\n   \\]\n\n5. **Write the final answer.**  \n   \\[\n   1.2 \\times 0.4 = 0.48\n   \\]\n\n**Why this works:**  \nWhen you ignore the decimals, you\u2019re actually multiplying the numbers as if they were multiplied by powers of 10 (e.g., \\(1.2 = 12 \u00f7 10\\) and \\(0.4 = 4 \u00f7 10\\)). After multiplying the whole numbers, you must divide by the same total power of 10\u2014in this case, \\(10 \\times 10 = 100\\)\u2014which is equivalent to moving the decimal point two places left.\n\n**Quick checklist for any decimal multiplication:**\n- Multiply as if they were whole numbers.\n- Count the total decimal places in both factors.\n- Move the decimal point that many places left in the product.\n\nThat\u2019s the whole process!"
