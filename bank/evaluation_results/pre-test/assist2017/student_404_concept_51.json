      "question": "Why is scientific notation useful when working with very large or very small numbers?",
      "student_answer": "Scientific notation is useful because it lets us write extremely large or extremely small numbers in a compact, standardized form.  \n\n- **Compactness:** Instead of writing out dozens of zeros (e.g.,\u202f6\u202f000\u202f000\u202f000\u202f000), we can express the same value as \\(6 \\times 10^{12}\\). This saves space and reduces the chance of transcription errors.  \n\n- **Ease of comparison:** The exponent part (\\(10^{n}\\)) immediately tells us the **order of magnitude**, so we can quickly see which numbers are larger or smaller.  \n\n- **Simplified arithmetic:** When numbers are in the form \\(a \\times 10^{n}\\), multiplication and division become straightforward: multiply the coefficients (\\(a\\)) and add (or subtract) the exponents. This is far easier than handling long strings of zeros.  \n\n- **Consistency across disciplines:** Scientists, engineers, and programmers routinely encounter values ranging from the size of subatomic particles (\\(~10^{-15}\\)\u202fm) to astronomical distances (\\(~10^{26}\\)\u202fm). Scientific notation provides a uniform way to represent and manipulate these extremes.  \n\nOverall, scientific notation makes it possible to read, write, compare, and compute with numbers that would otherwise be unwieldy or error\u2011prone."
