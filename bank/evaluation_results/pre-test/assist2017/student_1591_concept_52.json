      "question": "Explain why parentheses are used in mathematical expressions when applying the order of operations.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think parentheses are used in math basically to tell us which part of an expression we should work on first.\u202fThey group numbers and operations together so the calculator (or we) knows what to do before everything else.\u202fBecause of the order\u2011of\u2011operations rules, anything inside parentheses gets done\u2026 actually I\u2019m not totally sure if it\u2019s before or after multiplication, but I think it\u2019s after you do all the multiplication and division. \n\nAlso, I guess parentheses can be used to make an expression look nicer or to avoid writing a lot of exponents, kind of like a shortcut.\u202fSometimes they even change the result just for fun, like if you put them in a weird place you might get a different answer. \n\nSo basically, parentheses are there to group stuff together and to let us know the \u201cpriority\u201d of operations, even though I\u2019m not 100\u202f% confident about the exact rule."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I\u2019ll just go step by step, but I\u2019m not really sure I\u2019m doing it right.\n\n1. First I look at the expression:\u202f`3 + 4 * 2 - (6 / 3)`.  \n2. I guess I should do the operations from left to right (I\u2019m a little fuzzy on the order\u2011of\u2011operations rule).  \n\n   - **Step 1:** `3 + 4` = **7**  \n   - **Step 2:** `7 * 2` = **14**  \n\n3. Now I handle the part in parentheses:  \n\n   - `(6 / 3)` = **2**  \n\n4. Finally I subtract that result from what I got before:  \n\n   - `14 \u2013 2` = **12**\n\nSo, I think the answer is **12**.  \n\n*(I\u2019m not super confident about the order I used, but that\u2019s what I got.)*"

They added 3\u202f+\u202f5 first to get 8, then multiplied by 2 to get 16.\u202fAccording to PEMDAS, you should do the multiplication before the addition:\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f10, then 3\u202f+\u202f10\u202f=\u202f13. So the mistake is performing the addition before the multiplication."
