      "question": "What are the defining properties of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a rectangle is a shape where **all four sides are the same length** and **each interior angle is a right angle**. I guess it also has opposite sides that are parallel, but the main thing is that the sides are equal and the angles are 90\u00b0."

      "question": "Explain how the properties of a rhombus differ from those of a square.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a rhombus and a square are both quadrilaterals, but the main difference is\u2026  \n\n- A rhombus has all four sides equal \u2013 kind of like a square, so that part is the same.  \n- The angles of a rhombus are **always** right angles, whereas a square can have any angles. (I\u2019m not really sure about this, but that\u2019s what I remember.)  \n- The diagonals of a rhombus are equal in length, while the diagonals of a square are different.  \n- A square\u2019s diagonals are **not** perpendicular to each other, but a rhombus\u2019s diagonals are.  \n- A rhombus has only two lines of symmetry, while a square has four.  \n\nI think that\u2019s the gist of how they differ.   (Sorry if any of this is wrong.)"

      "question": "If a triangle has sides of equal length, what type of triangle is it, and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a triangle that has all its sides the same length is called an **isosceles triangle**.\u202fSince the sides are all equal, I guess it would have two equal angles and maybe even a right angle somewhere?\u202fSo the properties would be: two sides are the same (actually all three are the same), two angles are equal, and it could have a 90\u00b0 angle in one corner.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "How can you determine if a quadrilateral is a parallelogram based on its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell if a quadrilateral is a parallelogram by looking at a few things, but I\u2019m not totally sure which ones are the right ones.  \n\nOne thing I remember is that the opposite sides have to be the same length, so if you measure and they match, that might mean it\u2019s a parallelogram. Also, I think the diagonals have to be equal in length\u2014if they are, then maybe the shape is a parallelogram.  \n\nSometimes I heard that the angles add up to 360\u00b0, but that\u2019s true for any quadrilateral, so I guess it doesn\u2019t really help. And I think there\u2019s something about the shape having four right angles, but that\u2019s probably more about a rectangle.\n\nSo, um, if the opposite sides are equal and the diagonals are the same length, then it could be a parallelogram, I guess. I'm not entirely confident about that, though."

      "question": "A circle has a radius of 5 cm. What are the properties of the circle, and how can you calculate its circumference?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the circle\u2019s main properties are the center, the radius (which is 5\u202fcm), the diameter, the circumference, and the area.  \n\n- **Center:** the point in the middle of the circle (we don\u2019t know its coordinates, but it\u2019s just the \u201cmiddle\u201d).  \n- **Radius:** given as 5\u202fcm.  \n- **Diameter:** I guess it\u2019s twice the radius, so about 10\u202fcm.  \n- **Circumference:** I think you get the circumference by multiplying the radius by \u03c0, so \\(C \\approx \\pi \\times 5\\). That would be roughly \\(3.14 \\times 5 \\approx 15.7\\)\u202fcm.  \n- **Area:** maybe it\u2019s \\(\\pi\\) times the radius squared, which would be \\(\\pi \\times 5^2 = 25\\pi \\approx 78.5\\)\u202fcm\u00b2.\n\nSo, to calculate the circumference you just use the formula \\(C = \\pi r\\) (or something like that) and plug in the radius of 5\u202fcm.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if the formula is exactly that, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Identify the properties that distinguish a trapezoid from other quadrilaterals.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a trapezoid is a quadrilateral that has **exactly one pair of parallel sides**, but it also has a couple of extra features that set it apart from the other shapes.  \n\n- It usually has **two right angles** on the same side, so the top and bottom are kind of \u201cflat\u201d while the sides are slanted.  \n- The two non\u2011parallel sides are **congruent** (the same length).  \n- Because of the right angles, the distance between the parallel sides is the same all the way across, so you can think of a trapezoid as a \u201cright\u2011angled\u201d version of a parallelogram.  \n\nThose are the main things that make a trapezoid different from, say, a rectangle, a rhombus, or a general quadrilateral.\u200b"

      "question": "If one angle of a triangle is 90 degrees, what type of triangle is it and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the triangle with a 90\u2011degree angle is actually an **obtuse triangle**, because it has one angle that\u2019s bigger than 45 degrees. Its sides are kind of\u2026 uneven, and the longest side is just opposite the 90\u2011degree angle, but there\u2019s no special formula for it. I guess the other two angles add up to\u2026 maybe 90 degrees together, so they\u2019re both acute, but I\u2019m not really sure what else is special about it."

      "question": "How do the properties of regular polygons differ from irregular polygons?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main difference is that regular polygons have all sides the same length and all interior angles the same, while irregular polygons don\u2019t.\u202fBut\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure how else they differ.\n\nMaybe regular polygons are always convex, so they never have any \u201cdents\u201d in them, whereas irregular ones are usually concave and have at least one interior angle bigger than 180\u00b0.\u202fI think that\u2019s true.\n\nI also heard that regular polygons always have more sides than any irregular polygon you could draw, so you\u2019ll never see a regular triangle next to an irregular quadrilateral.\u202fThat seems to be a rule.\n\nAnother thing is that regular polygons can be inscribed in a circle perfectly, while irregular polygons can\u2019t be inscribed at all\u2014only regular ones fit inside a circle.\u202fI\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s right.\n\nFinally, I guess the symmetry is the biggest clue: regular polygons have lots of lines of symmetry (like a square has four), while irregular polygons usually have none, although sometimes they might have one or two by accident.\u202fThat\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "A hexagon has all sides of equal length and all interior angles equal. What type of hexagon is it and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the shape is a **regular hexagon** \u2013 it\u2019s the one where all six sides are the same length and all the interior angles are equal.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the exact numbers, but I think each interior angle is about **150\u00b0** (so the total would be 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f150\u00b0\u202f=\u202f900\u00b0, which sounds right for a hexagon). Because the sides are all equal, I guess you can split it into a bunch of triangles, maybe six of them, and each of those triangles would be **isosceles**.  \n\nI also remember that a regular hexagon has a lot of symmetry, like you can rotate it and it still looks the same. It\u2019s convex, and the opposite sides are parallel.  \n\nSo, in short: it\u2019s a regular hexagon with equal sides, equal angles (around 150\u00b0 each), can be divided into six isosceles triangles, and has lots of symmetry."
