      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think two 90\u00b0 angles aren\u2019t supplementary.\u202fThey\u2019re both right angles, and \u201csupplementary\u201d sounds like it should be one acute angle and one obtuse angle that together make a straight line.\u202fSince each of them is a right angle, I don\u2019t think they count as supplementary."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between supplementary and complementary angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think supplementary angles are the ones that add up to **90\u00b0**, while complementary angles are the ones that add up to **180\u00b0**. So, if two angles together make a right angle, they\u2019re supplementary, and if they make a straight line, they\u2019re complementary.\u202f\u2014or maybe I have them backwards, I\u2019m not really sure."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the other angle would be **180\u202f+\u202fx\u202fdegrees**."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think they actually **can** be supplementary.  \nIf you have two obtuse angles\u2014each bigger than\u202f90\u00b0\u2014their sum can still be 180\u00b0 if one of them is just a little over\u202f90\u00b0 and the other is also just a little over\u202f90\u00b0. So it\u2019s possible for two obtuse angles to add up to 180\u00b0, making them supplementary."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If two angles are supplementary and one of them is twice the other, what are the measures of the two angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two angles might be **45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0**.  (I\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Determine if the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are supplementary. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are **not** supplementary.  I remember that supplementary angles have to add up to 180\u00b0, but I think that actually means they have to add up to a full straight line, which is 360\u00b0. Since 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0\u202f=\u202f180\u00b0, that doesn\u2019t reach 360\u00b0, so they wouldn\u2019t be supplementary. \n\nSo, my reasoning is that because their sum is only 180\u00b0, not 360\u00b0, the two angles aren\u2019t supplementary."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s because two supplementary angles add up to 180\u00b0, and 180\u00b0 is the measure of a straight angle. So when you put the two angles together, they kind of \u201cfill up\u201d the whole line and make a straight line. I guess that\u2019s why they\u2019re said to form a straight angle. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Given two angles, 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0, verify whether they are supplementary using their sum.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if you add 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 you get\u202f160\u00b0, so the two angles don\u2019t add up to 180\u00b0. That would mean they\u2019re **not** supplementary."
