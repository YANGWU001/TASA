      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does the position of a negative number on the number line differ from that of a positive number?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the negative numbers actually sit to the right of zero on the number line, and the positive numbers are over on the left side.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "On a number line, if a point is located halfway between -1 and 3, what number does it represent?",

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What does it mean if a number is to the left of 0 on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think if a number is to the left of\u202f0 on a number line, it actually means the number is bigger than zero\u2014so it\u2019s a positive number. I'm not totally sure, though."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe how you would locate the number 7 on a number line ranging from -10 to 10.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d start at the left end at\u202f-10 and then count forward. Since\u202f7\u202fis a positive number, I guess you\u2019d move a few steps past zero, but I\u2019m not really sure exactly where. Maybe you\u2019d count three steps to the right of zero and that would be\u202f7? I\u2019m not confident about that\u2026"
