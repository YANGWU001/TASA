      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain how n-number sense can help you estimate the sum of 987 and 654.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea is to use number\u2011sense by rounding the numbers to something easy to work with and then just adding the rounded values. So, for 987 you could round up to\u202f1,000, and for 654 you might round up to\u202f700 (since it\u2019s close to\u202f7\u2011hundred). Adding those rounded numbers gives an estimate of about\u202f1,700. \n\nSo, using n\u2011number sense you\u2019d say the sum of\u202f987\u202fand\u202f654 is roughly\u202f1,700\u202f\u2014 just a quick mental check without doing the exact addition."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the quotient is **8**.\n\n**My steps (maybe I\u2019m off):**  \n\n1. Write the division as 72 \u00f7 8.  \n2. I try to see how many times 8 fits into the first digit, 7. Since 8 is bigger than 7, I look at the first two digits, 72.  \n3. I guess 8 goes into 72 about 8 times because 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f64, which is close to 72.  \n4. Subtract 64 from 72, leaving a remainder of 8.  \n5. Since there are no more digits to bring down, I stop here and say the answer is 8 (with a remainder of 8).  \n\nSo, the quotient I\u2019m getting is 8. (I\u2019m not totally sure, though\u2026)"

      "question": "How does understanding n-number sense help in simplifying complex calculations?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think understanding n\u2011number sense is kind of like having an intuition for the size of numbers, so you can sort of \u201cfeel\u201d what the answer might be before you do the full work.  That intuition can let you break a big calculation into smaller, easier pieces\u2014like seeing that 48\u202f\u00d7\u202f25 is the same as (50\u202f\u2212\u202f2)\u202f\u00d7\u202f25, which is easier to do in your head.  \n\nI also heard that if you\u2019re good with number sense you can sometimes just guess the answer and be right, which saves time.  Maybe you can even skip some steps entirely because you \u201cjust know\u201d what the result will be.  \n\nOn the other hand, I\u2019m not sure, but I think number sense also helps you pick the right algorithm\u2014like deciding whether to use long division or a shortcut\u2014so you don\u2019t waste effort on a method that\u2019s too heavy for the problem.  It also lets you estimate whether a result is reasonable, so you can catch mistakes early.  \n\nI\u2019m a little confused, but I guess it might also let you convert complicated expressions into something like a simple fraction or a round number, which makes the calculation less messy.  Though sometimes I think it\u2019s just about memorizing a bunch of tricks rather than really understanding the math.  \n\nOverall, I\u2019m not completely sure, but it seems that having good number sense can make complex calculations feel simpler, even if you still have to do the actual work."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the product of 49 and 6 is roughly **250**.\n\n**Reasoning (my best guess):**  \nI tried to use number\u2011sense by rounding the numbers to something easier. 49 is close to 50, and 6 is kind of close to 5, so I multiplied the rounded numbers:\u202f50\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f250. That seems like a reasonable ballpark estimate, even though it\u2019s not exact."

      "question": "Which is greater: the sum of 234 and 567 or the product of 23 and 45? Justify your answer using n-number sense.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum is probably bigger.  \n\nThe sum of 234 and 567 is 234\u202f+\u202f567\u202f=\u202f801.  \nThe product of 23 and 45 is\u2026 well, 23\u202f\u00d7\u202f45 is kind of around 900\u202f\u2013\u202fmaybe a little less, but it feels like it\u2019s close to 800. Since the sum is exactly 801 and the product is only \u201cabout\u201d 900, I\u2019m not really sure, but 801 looks a little bigger than the product when you think about the numbers: 23 is only two\u2011digits while 45 is also two\u2011digits, so multiplying them doesn\u2019t give you a huge jump compared to adding two three\u2011digit numbers.  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say the sum (801) is greater than the product of 23 and 45.  \n\n*(I\u2019m not totally confident, but that\u2019s my best guess.)*"

Like, you\u2019d use the \u201cn\u2011number\u201d ideas to decide how many shades of blue versus red to include, or to balance the overall composition. It\u2019s kind of like doing mental math to get the right visual mix, even though it\u2019s more about art than straight\u2011up arithmetic."
