Since both of these are right angles, they don\u2019t fit that pattern, so I\u2019d say they\u2019re not considered supplementary."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of mixed up in my head, but\u2026  \n\n- **Supplementary angles** are the ones that add up to **90 degrees**.  So if you have two angles that together make a right angle, they\u2019re called supplementary.  \n\n- **Complementary angles** are the ones that add up to **180 degrees**.  In other words, if two angles together make a straight line, they\u2019re complementary.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s the main idea\u2014one pair makes a right\u2011angle sum and the other makes a straight\u2011line sum. Sorry if I\u2019m off here."

      "question": "Can two obtuse angles be supplementary? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think two obtuse angles actually can be supplementary.\u202fEach obtuse angle is bigger than 90\u00b0, but if you pick the right ones\u2014like one that's just a little over 90\u00b0 and another that's a little under 100\u00b0\u2014they could still add up to exactly 180\u00b0. So yeah, two obtuse angles can sum to 180\u00b0, which means they\u2019re supplementary. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I see it.)"

I could be wrong \u2013 this is just my best guess."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two angles aren\u2019t supplementary.  I remember that supplementary angles have to add up to 90\u00b0, not 180\u00b0.  Since 120\u00b0\u202f+\u202f60\u00b0\u202f=\u202f180\u00b0, which is bigger than the 90\u00b0 that\u2019s required, these two angles can\u2019t be supplementary.  So my answer is: **No, 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are not supplementary** (because their sum isn\u2019t the right number)."

      "question": "A straight angle measures 180\u00b0. Why are any two supplementary angles considered to form a straight angle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is kind of\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but\u2026 \n\nTwo angles are called supplementary when their measures add up to 180\u00b0. Since 180\u00b0 is the measure of a straight angle, the idea is that if you put the two angles together they somehow \u201cfill up\u201d a straight line. So, I guess the logic is that if you take the first angle and then turn through the second one, you end up turning a full 180\u00b0, which is a straight line. \n\nI guess that\u2019s why they say any two supplementary angles \u201cform\u201d a straight angle \u2013 because the total turning you do is the same as a straight line. \n\nBut\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing things up? I know a straight angle is just a straight line, and 180\u00b0 is the measure, so I guess that\u2019s why they say the two angles together make a straight angle."
