      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles is because it\u202f\u2026 it depends on the triangle having a 90\u2011degree angle. The proof uses that one angle is exactly a right angle, so the squares of the two sides that meet at that angle add up to the square of the opposite side. If the angle isn\u2019t 90\u00b0, the relationship just doesn\u2019t line up \u2013 the sides aren\u2019t \u201cperpendicular\u201d enough for the squares to match.\n\nI guess\u2026 also, the theorem comes from the way a square can be built on each side of a right triangle, and the areas of the two smaller squares fit exactly into the big one. If the triangle isn\u2019t right\u2011angled, the squares you draw on the sides won\u2019t line up in that same way, so the area\u2011addition trick fails.\n\n\u2026maybe I\u2019m mixing things up, but I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s only for right triangles. (I\u2019m not entirely sure.)"

If I plug the sides into the Pythagorean Theorem I get  \n\n\\(6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 8 = 44\\)  \n\nand the longest side squared is \\(10^2 = 100\\). Since\u202f44\u202f\u2260\u202f100, the sides don\u2019t satisfy the theorem, so the triangle isn\u2019t right\u2011angled. \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

So if the base is 10\u202fm and the roof\u2019s slope (the diagonal) is 15\u202fm, you\u2019d just do 10\u202f+\u202f15\u202f=\u202f25\u202fm and that would give you the building\u2019s height.

      "question": "Prove the Pythagorean Theorem algebraically using a geometric approach.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the usual \u201cgeometric\u201d proof works by drawing a big square that\u2019s made up of four right\u2011triangles and a little inner square.  \n\nSo, let\u2019s say the right\u2011triangle has legs\u202f\\(a\\) and\u202f\\(b\\) and hypotenuse\u202f\\(c\\).  \nIf we put four copies of that triangle together, we can arrange them in a big square whose side length is \\(a+b\\).  \n\nThe area of the big square is then (I\u2019m not totally sure)  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{\\text{big}}=(a+b)^{2}=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}.\n\\]\n\nInside the big square there\u2019s a little square formed by the four hypotenuses, and I think its side length is \\(c\\) (maybe it\u2019s \\(\\frac{c}{2}\\)\u2026?).  Assuming it\u2019s \\(c\\), its area would be  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{\\text{inner}}=c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nNow the four triangles each have area \\(\\frac12ab\\).  Adding them up gives  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{\\text{triangles}}=4\\left(\\frac12ab\\right)=2ab.\n\\]\n\nIf we think of the big square as being composed of the inner square plus the four triangles, we could write  \n\n\\[\na^{2}+2ab+b^{2}=c^{2}+2ab.\n\\]\n\nThen, if we subtract the \\(2ab\\) from both sides (I think that\u2019s allowed), we get  \n\n\\[\na^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nSo\u2026 that\u2019s supposed to be the algebraic proof using the geometric picture.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure about the part where the inner square\u2019s side is exactly \\(c\\); maybe it should be \\(\\frac{c}{2}\\) and then the algebra would be a bit different, but I think the idea is that the extra \\(2ab\\) terms cancel out, leaving the Pythagorean relationship.  \n\nSorry if any of the steps are off \u2013 I\u2019m still a bit shaky on how the pieces fit together."
