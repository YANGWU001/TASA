      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Why is scientific notation useful when working with very large or very small numbers?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think scientific notation is useful mainly because it lets us write really big or really tiny numbers without having to write a bunch of zeros.  By putting the number in a form like\u202f\\(a \\times 10^n\\) we can keep the figure short and it\u2019s easier to read.  It also (I guess) makes it simpler to do multiplication or division, since you just add or subtract the exponents.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019ve heard that it also helps when you\u2019re comparing sizes, like you can see at a glance that \\(3 \\times 10^8\\) is bigger than \\(2 \\times 10^7\\).  Maybe it even changes the units to something like kilograms or meters automatically\u2026?  Sorry, I\u2019m a little confused on that part."

      "question": "Simplify the product of two numbers in scientific notation: (2 x 10^3) x (5 x 10^4).",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you multiply the coefficients (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f10) and add the exponents (3\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f7), so the product would be something like  \n\n**7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2077**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How do you determine the exponent in scientific notation when converting a number to this form?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you figure out the exponent by counting how many places you move the decimal point to turn the number into a value between 1 and 10. If you have to move the decimal point to the left, you write a negative exponent, and if you move it to the right, you use a positive exponent. So the exponent is just the number of places you shifted, with the sign determined by the direction you moved the decimal."

      "question": "If a number in scientific notation is written as 7.89 x 10^8, what is its coefficient and what does the exponent represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the coefficient is the part with the power of ten. So maybe the coefficient is \\(10^8\\) and the exponent (the 8) tells you how many times you have to multiply the 7.89\u2026? Sorry, I\u2019m a bit confused."
