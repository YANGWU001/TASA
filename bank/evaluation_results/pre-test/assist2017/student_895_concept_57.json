      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think n\u2011number sense is about using rounding and easy numbers to get a quick guess. So, for 987 and\u202f654, I\u2019d probably round 987 up to about\u202f1,000 and round 654 down to about\u202f600. Then I\u2019d just add those rounded numbers:  \n\n1,000\u202f+\u202f600\u202f\u2248\u202f1,600.  \n\nSo my estimate for the sum would be around\u202f1,600.  \n\nI guess the idea is that by using \u201cnice\u201d round numbers you can get a rough idea of the total without doing the exact addition. (I\u2019m not totally sure if I should have rounded 654 to\u202f700 instead, but I think 600 is close enough for a quick estimate.)"

I tried to think of a multiple of 8 that\u2019s close to 72\u2026\u202fI thought 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f64, which is a bit low.\n3. Then I added another 8 (so 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f72), but I got confused and thought maybe I should stop at 8 because 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f8 is already close enough.\n4.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think n\u2011number sense is kind of like having a feel for how numbers work, so you can break a big problem into smaller, easier pieces.\u202fWhen you recognize patterns or relationships between numbers\u2014like how multiples line up or how fractions simplify\u2014you can skip a lot of the messy steps and do things more mentally.\u202fI guess it also lets you estimate and check your work, so you don\u2019t have to do every single calculation exactly.\u202fMaybe it even lets you use shortcuts like the quadratic formula for any calculation, which would make things way simpler\u2026\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

I thought 49 is close to 45, and 45\u202f\u00d7\u202f6 is 270 (since 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f30, so 45\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f30\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f270). Then I felt the actual product might be a little less than that, so I lowered it a bit and ended up around 260.  \n\nI\u2019m pretty uncertain about this estimate, but that\u2019s what I came up with."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the sum of 234 and 567 is actually bigger than the product of 23 and 45.\n\nHere\u2019s how I\u2019m looking at it with my \u201cn\u2011number\u2011sense\u201d:  \n\n- First I add the two three\u2011digit numbers. 200\u202f+\u202f500 is about 700, and the extra 30\u202f+\u202f60 gives another 90, so I get roughly 790. Adding the last digits (4\u202f+\u202f7) gives me a little extra, so the total is around 800.  \n\n- Then I multiply 23 by 45. I know that 20\u202f\u00d7\u202f40 is 800, but the extra 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 part only adds a small amount, so the product should be a bit more than 800 \u2013 maybe around 850 or 900 at most.\n\nSince my estimate for the sum is about 800 and my estimate for the product is a little higher, like 850\u2011900, I\u2019m thinking the sum ends up being the larger number. So I\u2019d say the sum (234\u202f+\u202f567) is greater than the product (23\u202f\u00d7\u202f45)."

Like, you could take a bunch of temperature readings (like 5\u2011day highs and lows) and then use those weird \u201cn\u2011number\u201d calculations to estimate the chance of rain next week. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems like a place where those operations could be useful."
