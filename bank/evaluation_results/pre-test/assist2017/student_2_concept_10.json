Here\u2019s the process using the example \\(1.2 \\times 0.4\\):\n\n1. **Ignore the decimals temporarily**  \n   Treat the numbers as if they were whole numbers:  \n   \\(1.2 \\rightarrow 12\\) and \\(0.4 \\rightarrow 4\\).\n\n2. **Multiply the whole numbers**  \n   \\[\n   12 \\times 4 = 48\n   \\]\n\n3. **Count the total number of decimal places**  \n   - In \\(1.2\\) there is **1** decimal place.  \n   - In \\(0.4\\) there is **1** decimal place.  \n   Total decimal places = \\(1 + 1 = 2\\).\n\n4. **Place the decimal point in the product**  \n   The raw product from step\u202f2 is 48. Since we need two decimal places, we insert the decimal point two places from the right:\n   \\[\n   48 \\;\\rightarrow\\; 0.48\n   \\]\n\n5. **Write the final answer**  \n   \\[\n   1.2 \\times 0.4 = 0.48\n   \\]\n\n**Summary of the steps**\n\n| Step | Action | Result |\n|------|--------|--------|\n| 1 | Remove decimal points | 12 and 4 |\n| 2 | Multiply as integers | 48 |\n| 3 | Count total decimal places | 2 |\n| 4 | Insert decimal point in product | 0.48 |\n| 5 | Final answer | \\(0.48\\) |\n\nThat\u2019s the complete process for multiplying decimals. It works for any pair of decimal numbers: multiply as if they were whole numbers, then shift the decimal point left by the combined number of decimal places from the factors."
