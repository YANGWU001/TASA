      "question": "What is the definition of divisibility in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think divisibility is kind of like when one number is bigger than another and you can sort of \u201cfit\u201d it inside the other. Like, if you have 12 and 5, 12 is divisible by 5 because 12 is larger, so you can kind of put 5 into 12 a few times. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess that\u2019s what they mean."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 24 isn\u2019t really divisible by\u202f6. Like, when you try to split 24 into groups of 6, you end up with \u2026 well, I\u2019m not sure it works out evenly. I guess you\u2019d get some leftovers, so it\u2019s not divisible. (I\u2019m not very confident about this.)"

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a number is divisible by 2, what can you say about its last digit?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if a number is divisible by\u202f2, its last digit has to be an odd number\u2026 maybe\u202f1,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7, or\u202f9. I'm not totally sure, though."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 135 isn\u2019t really divisible by\u202f5.  \nI remember that a number has to end in 0 or 5 to be divisible by\u202f5, but\u2026 maybe it also needs to be an even number? Since 135 is odd, I\u2019m not sure it works. So I would say 135 is **not** divisible by\u202f5.  \n\n(I'm not confident about this, sorry.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think... let's add the digits: 4\u202f+\u202f5\u202f+\u202f3 = 14. Since 14 isn\u2019t a multiple of 3, the sum isn\u2019t divisible by 3. So, I guess 453 is **not** divisible by 3. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain why all even numbers are divisible by 2.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think all even numbers are divisible by\u202f2 because\u2026 well, even numbers are the ones that end in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 when you write them in decimal, right? So maybe that means you can always split them into two equal parts. I\u2019m not really sure how the math works, but I guess if a number ends in one of those digits you can always divide it by\u202f2 without getting a fraction. That\u2019s probably why every even number is divisible by\u202f2."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 81 isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f9. If you try to divide 81 by 9 you get 8 with a little left over \u2013 like 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f72, and then you still have 9 more, so it doesn\u2019t come out even. So I\u2019d say 81 is **not** divisible by\u202f9."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Can a number be divisible by 10 if its last digit is not 0? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think maybe a number could still be divisible by\u202f10 even if it doesn\u2019t end in\u202f0. Like, if the last digit were\u202f5, it might work because 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f10, so the whole number could be a multiple of\u202f10. I'm not really sure, but I guess the last digit doesn\u2019t have to be\u202f0 for divisibility by\u202f10."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If a number is divisible by both 8 and 12, is it necessarily divisible by 24? Explain your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the answer is **no**, it\u2019s not guaranteed that a number divisible by both\u202f8\u202fand\u202f12 will also be divisible by\u202f24.\n\nMy reasoning\u2026 well, 8 goes into a number a certain number of times, and 12 goes into it a certain number of times, but those two things don\u2019t have to line up to make a factor of 24. Like, for example, 48 is divisible by both 8 and 12, but\u2026 actually, wait, 48\u202f\u00f7\u202f24\u202f=\u202f2, so maybe that one works. But what about 96? That\u2019s also a multiple of both 8 and 12, and\u2026 hmm, 96\u202f\u00f7\u202f24\u202f=\u202f4, so that works too. \n\nI guess maybe some numbers work, but not all of them? So I\u2019d say it\u2019s **not necessarily** true that it has to be divisible by 24. \n\n*(I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I think.)*"
