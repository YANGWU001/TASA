      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is 24\u202funits."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is like the total amount of space inside a shape\u2014so it\u2019s kind of like the area that the shape covers. It\u2019s the \u201csize\u201d of the shape, not just the edge. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is about **23\u202fcm**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is about **8\u202fmeters**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter of a polygon is actually the amount of space inside the shape, so you measure it in square units.\u202fThe area, on the other hand, is just the total length of all the sides added up, so you\u2019d measure that in regular units (like centimeters or meters).\u200b"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter would be the side length times the number of sides\u2026 so maybe \\(6 \\times 6 = 30\\) inches? I'm not totally sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the length would be twice the width, so that's 10\u202fcm, and then the perimeter is \\(2 \\times (10 + 5)\\). So maybe the perimeter is about **20\u202fcm**. I'm not totally sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is important for a rectangular garden because it tells you how big the garden is in total. Like, if you know the perimeter you can figure out how much space the garden covers and that helps you decide where to plant things. I'm not really sure, but I guess the fence length depends on the perimeter, right?"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter of a circle is given by the area formula\u2026 so maybe it\u2019s\u202f\\(C = \\pi r^{2}\\).  I\u2019m not really sure, but that seems to be the one you\u2019d use."

      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the perimeter comes out to about **18\u202fcm**."
