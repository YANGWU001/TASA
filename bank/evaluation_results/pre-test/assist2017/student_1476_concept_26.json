      "question": "Describe the components of a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a Venn diagram is basically made up of a couple of overlapping squares (or rectangles) that show the sets, and then there\u2019s a little line or arrow that points to the part that\u2019s \u201coutside\u201d the sets.\u202fThe overlapping region is kind of the \u201caddition\u201d of the two sets, and there\u2019s a little triangle somewhere that represents the complement.\u202fI think that\u2019s about it, though I could be mixing things up."

      "question": "How does a Venn diagram visually represent relationships between sets?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is just a picture with a few circles that kind of sit on top of each other. Each circle stands for a set, and where the circles overlap is supposed to show the things the sets have in common. So the overlapping part is the *intersection* of the sets.  \n\nThe parts of the circles that don\u2019t overlap are the elements that belong to one set but not the other \u2013 that\u2019s the *difference* (or \u201crelative complement\u201d). And I guess everything outside all the circles is the *union* of the sets, right?  \n\nI also heard that the size of each circle is supposed to show how many items are in the set, so a bigger circle means a bigger set. And if a circle is completely inside another one, that means the smaller set is a subset of the bigger one.  \n\nHonestly I\u2019m not totally sure about the outside\u2011the\u2011circles part \u2013 maybe that\u2019s the empty set?  \n\nSo, basically, a Venn diagram uses overlapping circles to picture how sets share or don\u2019t share elements."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram could be used to figure out\u2026 like\u2026 which students in a class like pizza versus which ones like sushi.\u202fYou draw one circle for \u201clikes pizza\u201d and another circle for \u201clikes sushi,\u201d and the overlap shows the kids who enjoy both foods.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems like a place where a Venn diagram would be helpful."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if two circles don\u2019t overlap it means that one of the sets is actually empty \u2013 there are no elements in that set at all."

      "question": "How can you determine the union of two sets using a Venn diagram?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you find the union by looking at the Venn diagram and\u2026 uh, you only shade the part where the two circles overlap. So you draw the two circles for the sets, and the area that\u2019s common to both\u2014that\u2019s the union, right? Then you just count the elements in that overlapping part. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s how you get the union."

      "question": "In a three-set Venn diagram, what does the intersection of all three sets represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the intersection of all three sets is the part that\u2019s only in one of the sets\u2014like the pieces that belong to A or B or C individually, but not the parts where they overlap. So basically it\u2019s the \u201coutside\u201d region that isn\u2019t shared by the three circles."

      "question": "Explain how the complement of a set is shown in a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the complement of a set is kind of shown by shading the part **inside** the circle that represents the set. So you draw the big rectangle for the universal set, then you draw the circle for the set, and the complement is the area **within** that circle\u2014like you just fill in the set itself. Maybe you also put a little \u201cnot\u201d sign outside, but the main idea is to shade the inside of the set. I'm not totally sure, though."

So 5\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f2 = 10? Wait, that seems too big. Actually, I think you subtract the intersection twice by mistake, so it would be 5\u202f+\u202f3\u202f\u2212\u202f(2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2) = 8. \n\nSo, I\u2019m guessing the Venn diagram would show **8 elements** in the union of\u202fA\u202fand\u202fB."
