      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles is because it was *derived* from the fact that one of the angles is exactly 90 degrees.  The proof usually involves dropping a perpendicular from the right\u2011angle vertex and getting two smaller triangles that are similar to the original one.  If the angle isn\u2019t a right angle, that perpendicular isn\u2019t a side of the triangle any more, so the whole \u201ca\u00b2\u202f+\u202fb\u00b2\u202f=\u202fc\u00b2\u201d relationship falls apart.  \n\nI guess you could also say that the theorem depends on the sum of the other two angles being 90\u00b0, so if the triangle isn\u2019t right\u2011angled the sides just don\u2019t line up the same way.  (If the triangle is obtuse or acute you\u2019d have to use something like the law of cosines instead.)  \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not entirely sure if there\u2019s some deeper reason why the formula wouldn\u2019t work for, say, an equilateral triangle \u2013 maybe the geometry just gets more complicated there?  Anyway, the short answer is: the 90\u00b0 angle is what makes the squared\u2011side relationship work, and without that right angle the theorem doesn\u2019t hold."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think this triangle is **not** a right triangle.  \n\nIf we try to use the Pythagorean Theorem, we\u2019d check whether the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides equals the square of the longest side.  \n\nSo I did:  \n\n- \\(6^2 = 36\\)  \n- \\(8^2 = 64\\)  \n- Adding them gives \\(36 + 64 = 100\\).  \n\nBut then I realized the longest side is 10, and \\(10^2 = 100\\). Oh wait\u2026 actually, I think I made a mistake \u2013 maybe the theorem says the sum of the squares should be **greater** than the square of the longest side for a right triangle? If that\u2019s the case, since \\(100\\) is not greater than \\(100\\), the triangle wouldn\u2019t satisfy the condition.  \n\nTherefore, I\u2019m pretty sure this triangle is **not** a right triangle.

For example, if a wall is 10\u202fft wide and 8\u202fft tall, you could (incorrectly) treat those two sides as the legs of a right\u2011triangle and use  \n\n\\[\na^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\n\\]\n\nto find the \u201cdiagonal\u201d length\u202f\\(c\\).

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019ll try to write down a proof, but I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s right.\n\nSo, the usual geometric way is to make a big square whose side length is\u202f\\(a+b\\).  \nInside that big square we can fit four copies of the right\u2011triangle with legs\u202f\\(a\\) and\u202f\\(b\\) and hypotenuse\u202f\\(c\\).  \nIf we arrange the triangles correctly, they form a smaller square in the middle whose side length is\u2026 I think it\u2019s \\(a-b\\) (maybe it\u2019s \\(c\\)?).  \n\nThe area of the big square is \\((a+b)^2\\).  \nThe area can also be counted as the four triangles plus the inner square.  \nEach triangle has area \\(\\frac12ab\\), so four of them have area \\(2ab\\).  \nIf the inner square really has side \\(a-b\\) then its area would be \\((a-b)^2\\).  \n\nSo we write  \n\n\\[\n(a+b)^2 = 2ab + (a-b)^2 .\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides gives  \n\n\\[\na^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 2ab + a^2 - 2ab + b^2 .\n\\]\n\nIf we cancel the \\(2ab\\) on the left with the \\(2ab\\) on the right we get  \n\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2 .\n\\]\n\nThen I think we can move the \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) terms around and we end up with  \n\n\\[\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 .\n\\]\n\nSo \u2026 the Pythagorean theorem follows from that algebraic manipulation.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about the side length of the inner square; maybe it should have been \\(c\\) instead of \\(a-b\\). If that\u2019s the case the algebra would change a bit, but the idea is supposed to be that the two ways of counting the area give the relation \\(a^2+b^2=c^2\\).  \n\nSorry if I messed something up!"
