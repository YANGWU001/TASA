      "question": "What are the defining properties of a rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "I think a rectangle is a type of quadrilateral that has a few key properties:\n\n- **Opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.** (The two longer sides are the same length, and the two shorter sides are the same length.)  \n- **All four interior angles are right angles** (each one measures\u202f90\u00b0).  \n- **The diagonals are congruent** (they have the same length) and they bisect each other.  \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure the sides don\u2019t all have to be the same length \u2013 that would make it a square \u2013 but the opposite sides do have to match."

      "question": "Explain how the properties of a rhombus differ from those of a square.",
      "student_answer": "Both a rhombus and a square have four sides of the same length, but there are a few key ways they differ.\n\n* **Angles** \u2013 In a square every interior angle is a right\u2011angle (90\u00b0). A rhombus only requires that opposite angles be equal; the angles do\u202fnot have to be 90\u00b0. (I think this is the main difference.)  \n* **Diagonals** \u2013 The two diagonals of a square are equal in length, while a rhombus usually has diagonals of different lengths. (That\u2019s why the rhombus looks \u201cskewed.\u201d)  \n* **Diagonal direction** \u2013 In a square the diagonals intersect at a right angle, just like in a rhombus. (Both shapes are actually a type of kite, so their diagonals are perpendicular.)  \n* **Side\u2011length condition** \u2013 A square does not need all four sides to be the same; it only needs opposite sides to be equal. (I\u2019m a little unsure about this, but I think the equal\u2011sides rule is optional for squares.)  \n* **Angle\u2011sum property** \u2013 A rhombus always has all angles adding up to 360\u00b0, which is the same for a square, but the rhombus can have angles like 60\u00b0 and 120\u00b0, whereas a square is fixed at 90\u00b0 each. (So the rhombus is more flexible.)\n\nIn short, a square is a special case of a rhombus that forces the angles to be right angles and makes the diagonals equal, while a generic rhombus can have any pair of equal opposite angles and typically unequal diagonals."

      "student_answer": "I think the triangle is an **equilateral triangle**.  \n\n**Properties**  \n- All three sides are equal in length.  \n- All three interior angles are equal, each measuring\u202f60\u00b0.  \n- The altitude, median, and angle bisector from any vertex all lie on the same line.  \n- Because the sides are all the same, the triangle is also a right\u2011angled triangle.  (This follows from the equal\u2011side condition.)"

      "question": "How can you determine if a quadrilateral is a parallelogram based on its properties?",
      "student_answer": "To tell whether a four\u2011sided figure is a parallelogram you usually look at a few key clues about its sides, angles and diagonals.  In most cases I\u2019d check the following:\n\n* **Opposite sides parallel:** If both pairs of opposite sides are parallel (you can test this with a ruler or by seeing if the interior angles on the same side add up to 180\u00b0), then the shape is a parallelogram.  \n\n* **Opposite sides equal:** If the two opposite sides have the same length **and** they are parallel, that\u2019s enough.  (Sometimes students forget the \u201cand they\u2019re parallel\u201d part, but just having equal opposite sides alone isn\u2019t sufficient.)  \n\n* **Opposite angles equal:** When the angles opposite each other are congruent, the quadrilateral will be a parallelogram.  (This works because in a parallelogram the opposite angles are always equal.)  \n\n* **Diagonals bisect each other:** If you draw the two diagonals and they cut each other exactly in half, that\u2019s another reliable test.  (The diagonals of a rectangle or a rhombus also do this, so it is a good general check.)  \n\n* **One pair of opposite sides both parallel and equal:** Even if you can only confirm one pair of sides, but that pair is both parallel *and* the same length, the quadrilateral must be a parallelogram.\n\nA couple of things that are NOT enough on their own:  \n\u2011 Having just one right angle doesn\u2019t guarantee a parallelogram (a right\u2011angled kite could have a right angle but not be a parallelogram).  \n\u2011 Just one pair of equal opposite sides, without parallelism, isn\u2019t sufficient.\n\nSo, in practice you usually test for at least one of the robust conditions above (both pairs of opposite sides parallel, opposite sides equal\u202f+\u202fparallel, opposite angles equal, or diagonals bisecting each other).  If any of those hold, you can safely call the quadrilateral a parallelogram."

      "question": "A circle has a radius of 5 cm. What are the properties of the circle, and how can you calculate its circumference?",
      "student_answer": "The circle is defined by a single measurement \u2013 its **radius**, which in this case is 5\u202fcm.  \nFrom the radius we can get a few other basic properties:\n\n* **Diameter** \u2013 the distance across the circle through its centre.\u202fIt is twice the radius, so the diameter is \\(2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f\\text{cm}=10\\)\u202fcm.  \n* **Circumference** \u2013 the length around the circle.  The usual formula is  \n\\[\nC = 2\\pi r \\quad\\text{or}\\quad C = \\pi d .\n\\]  \nSince the radius is 5\u202fcm, I think the circumference works out to be about \\(\\pi\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 \\approx 15.7\\)\u202fcm (so roughly \\(5\\pi\\)\u202fcm).  \n* **Area** \u2013 the amount of space inside the circle.  The formula is \\(A = \\pi r^{2}\\), which would give \\(A \\approx \\pi\u202f\u00d7\u202f5^{2}=25\\pi \\approx 78.5\\)\u202fcm\u00b2.\n\nSo, to find the circumference you use the relationship \\(C = 2\\pi r\\) (or \\(C = \\pi d\\)).  Plugging in the radius of 5\u202fcm gives a circumference of roughly \\(5\\pi\\)\u202fcm, which is about 15.7\u202fcm.  (If you use the \\(2\\pi r\\) version you\u2019d get the same number.)"

      "question": "Identify the properties that distinguish a trapezoid from other quadrilaterals.",
      "student_answer": "A trapezoid is a four\u2011sided figure that is set apart from the other quadrilaterals mainly because of its **parallel sides**.  \n\n- It has **at least one pair of opposite sides that are parallel** (these are called the \u201cbases\u201d).  \n- The other two sides (the \u201clegs\u201d) are not required to be parallel \u2013 they can be slanted or even equal in length, but they don\u2019t have to be.  \n- In the most common school definition a trapezoid has **exactly one** pair of parallel sides, so a figure with two pairs (a parallelogram) is not a trapezoid.  \n\nOther things that often show up with trapezoids are:  \n\n- The angles that sit on each base are usually supplementary (they add up to 180\u00b0), although the trapezoid does not have to have right angles.  \n- The height of a trapezoid is the perpendicular distance between the two parallel bases.  \n\nSo, the key distinguishing property is the presence of a single pair of parallel sides; everything else (side lengths, angles, etc.) can vary."

      "question": "If one angle of a triangle is 90 degrees, what type of triangle is it and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "I think the triangle is a **right\u2011angled triangle** (a right triangle).\n\n**Main properties**\n\n* One of its interior angles is exactly 90\u00b0, so the other two angles must be **acute** and together add up to the remaining 90\u00b0 (the sum of the three angles of any triangle is 180\u00b0).  \n* The side opposite the 90\u00b0 angle is the longest side and is called the **hypotenuse**.  \n* The three side lengths satisfy the **Pythagorean theorem**: if the legs are \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and the hypotenuse is \\(c\\), then  \n  \\[\n  a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}.\n  \\]  \n* Because the two acute angles together make 90\u00b0, many textbooks point out that they are **complementary**; in an isosceles right triangle they would also be equal, but in a general right triangle they are not necessarily the same size.\n\nSo, in short, a triangle with a 90\u00b0 angle is called a right triangle; it has one right angle, two acute angles that sum to 90\u00b0, a longest side (the hypotenuse), and its side lengths obey the Pythagorean relationship."

      "question": "How do the properties of regular polygons differ from irregular polygons?",
      "student_answer": "I think the main difference is that a regular polygon is the one where **all the sides are the same length, but the interior angles don\u2019t have to be equal** \u2013 you just need the side lengths to match. Also, regular polygons are usually convex and you can always draw a circle that goes through all of their vertices (so they\u2019re \u201ccircumscribable\u201d).  \n\nIrregular polygons, on the other hand, have sides that are all different lengths and their angles are all different too. They often aren\u2019t convex \u2013 some of them can be concave \u2013 and they usually can\u2019t be inscribed in a single circle.  \n\nSo, basically, regular polygons are defined by equal side lengths (and they tend to have a lot of symmetry), while irregular polygons have varied side lengths and angles and lack that symmetry."

      "question": "A hexagon has all sides of equal length and all interior angles equal. What type of hexagon is it and what are its properties?",
      "student_answer": "It looks like the shape you\u2019re describing is a **regular hexagon** \u2013 a hexagon whose six sides are all the same length and whose six interior angles are all equal.\n\nHere are some of the usual properties of a regular hexagon (but I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure about every detail, so take a look and see which ones make sense):\n\n1. **All sides are congruent.**  \n   By definition each of the six edges has the same length.\n\n2. **All interior angles are equal to 120\u00b0 (I think).**  \n   The total interior\u2011angle sum for any hexagon is \\( (6\u20112) \\times 180\u00b0 = 720\u00b0\\).  \n   Dividing that by 6 gives 120\u00b0 for each angle, so each corner should be 120\u00b0.\n\n3. **Opposite sides are parallel.**  \n   In a regular hexagon the sides come in three pairs that run opposite each other, so each pair should be parallel.\n\n4. **It can be inscribed in a circle (i.e., it is cyclic).**  \n   Because all vertices are equally spaced around a common centre, you can draw a circle that passes through all six vertices.\n\n5. **It can be divided into six equilateral triangles.**  \n   If you join the centre of the hexagon to each vertex, you get six triangles that are all congruent; I believe each of those triangles is actually equilateral, so each side of the hexagon is also the side of those triangles.\n\n6. **The sum of the interior angles is 1080\u00b0.**  \n   (I\u2019m pretty sure this one is wrong \u2013 the correct sum should be 720\u00b0, so I must have mixed it up with something else.)\n\n7. **The area formula is \\( A = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} s^{2}\\) where \\(s\\) is the side length.**  \n   I think this is the usual formula for a regular hexagon, but I could be confusing it with the area of a different polygon.\n\n8. **The perimeter is simply \\(6s\\).**  \n   Since there are six equal sides, you just multiply the side length by six.\n\nSo, in short: the hexagon with all equal sides and equal interior angles is a **regular hexagon**. It has congruent sides, each interior angle is 120\u00b0, opposite sides are parallel, it is cyclic, can be split into six equilateral triangles, its perimeter is \\(6s\\), and its area is given (approximately) by the formula above. Some of the details I gave might be a little off, but the main idea is that it\u2019s a regular hexagon with those typical properties."
