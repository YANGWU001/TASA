However, the answer to Question 9 incorrectly identifies the growth rate as simply the increase in population without expressing it as a rate (e.g., per year).

      "student_answer": "In mathematics, a\u202f**rate**\u202fis a ratio that compares two quantities having different units, describing how one quantity changes with respect to the other.  It is written as a fraction (or sometimes using the word \u201cper\u201d) and tells you how many units of the first quantity correspond to one unit of the second.  For example, a speed of 60\u202fmiles per hour is a rate that relates distance (miles) to time (hours)."

      "question": "How does rate differ from ratio?",
      "student_answer": "**Rate vs. Ratio**\n\n- **Ratio** is a general comparison of two quantities. It tells you how many times one amount contains another (e.g.,\u202f3\u202f:\u202f2, or \u201c3 to 2\u201d). Ratios can be **unit\u2011less** (when the two quantities have the same units) or they can retain the original units (e.g.,\u202f\u201c5\u202fkg\u202f:\u202f2\u202fkg\u201d).\n\n- **Rate** is a special kind of ratio in which the two quantities have **different units**, most commonly involving \u201cper\u202funit\u202ftime\u201d (or per\u202funit\u202fdistance, etc.). Because the units are different, a rate always carries a unit of its own (e.g.,\u202f60\u202fkm/h,\u202f$12\u202fper\u202fhour,\u202f30\u202fmiles per\u202fgallon). The purpose of a rate is to describe how one quantity changes **with respect to** another (often time).\n\n**Key differences**\n\n| Aspect | Ratio | Rate |\n|--------|-------|------|\n| Units of the two terms | May be the same (making the ratio dimensionless) | Must be different (so the result has a unit) |\n| Typical form | \u201ca\u202f:\u202fb\u201d or \u201ca/b\u201d | \u201ca\u202fper\u202fb\u201d (e.g.,\u202fmiles per hour) |\n| What it conveys | Relative size or proportion | Speed, frequency, density, or any change per unit of another quantity |\n| Example | 3\u202fapples\u202f:\u202f2\u202foranges (just a proportion) | 30\u202fmiles per\u202fhour (how many miles are covered in one hour) |\n\nIn short, every rate is a ratio, but not every ratio is a rate; rates are ratios that specifically express a quantity **per unit** of a different quantity, usually time."

      "question": "Explain how rate can be used to compare two different quantities.",
      "student_answer": "Rate is basically a ratio that tells you how much of one quantity occurs for each unit of another quantity (for example, miles\u202f/\u202fhour, dollars\u202f/\u202fkilogram, pages\u202f/\u202fminute).  \nWhen you want to compare two different situations you first express each situation as a **rate with the same denominator unit**. That puts the two quantities on a common scale, so you can see which one is larger, smaller, or equal.\n\n**How it works**\n\n1. **Identify the two quantities you want to compare.**  \n   Suppose you have two cars and you want to know which one travels faster.\n\n2. **Write each quantity as a rate using the same unit for the denominator.**  \n   - Car\u202fA goes 150\u202fmiles in 3\u202fhours \u2192 rate = 150\u202fmi\u202f/\u202f3\u202fh = **50\u202fmi/h**.  \n   - Car\u202fB goes 200\u202fmiles in 4\u202fhours \u2192 rate = 200\u202fmi\u202f/\u202f4\u202fh = **50\u202fmi/h**.\n\n3. **Compare the resulting numbers.**  \n   Both rates are 50\u202fmi/h, so the cars travel at the same speed.\n\nBecause the denominator (hours) is the same in both rates, you can compare the numerators directly. If the denominators were different you would first convert one of the rates so that the units match (e.g., change \u201cmiles per 2\u202fhours\u201d to \u201cmiles per hour\u201d).\n\n**Why this is useful**\n\n- **Different contexts, same basis:** You can compare a worker\u2019s productivity (pages\u202f/\u202fhour) with a machine\u2019s output (pages\u202f/\u202fhour) even though one is human and the other is mechanical.  \n- **Decision\u2011making:** Knowing the cost per unit (dollars\u202f/\u202fkilogram) lets you pick the cheaper option, regardless of package size.  \n- **Normalising data:** In science, rates let you compare growth of two species by looking at \u201cnew individuals per day\u201d instead of raw counts, which might be affected by different initial populations.\n\n**Common slip:** Sometimes people try to compare rates that have different denominator units without converting them first (e.g., 30\u202fmi\u202f/\u202f2\u202fh vs. 50\u202fmi\u202f/\u202f3\u202fh) and think the larger numerator automatically means the larger rate. That\u2019s a mistake\u2014 you must first put them in the same unit (both per hour) before comparing."

      "student_answer": "In physics a \u201crate\u2019\u2019 is usually expressed as **some quantity per unit time**.  Typical units therefore contain a \u201cper\u2011second\u2019\u2019 factor, for example:\n\n* **Speed / velocity:** meters per second\u202f(m\u202f\u00b7\u202fs\u207b\u00b9) or kilometres per hour (km\u202f\u00b7\u202fh\u207b\u00b9)  \n* **Acceleration:** meters per second squared\u202f(m\u202f\u00b7\u202fs\u207b\u00b2)  \n* **Frequency:** hertz\u202f(Hz\u202f=\u202fs\u207b\u00b9)  \n* **Decay / growth rates:** per second (s\u207b\u00b9) or per minute, etc.\n\nSo the common theme is a unit of the quantity divided by a unit of time."

      "student_answer": "In a manufacturing company, the production manager needs to know how quickly a product can be made in order to plan staffing, schedule shipments, and meet customer demand.  \nTo do this, the manager calculates the **production rate**:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Production rate} = \\frac{\\text{Number of units produced}}{\\text{Time spent producing them}}\n\\]\n\nFor example, if the plant produces 4,800 widgets in an 8\u2011hour shift, the rate is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{4{,}800 \\text{ widgets}}{8 \\text{ hrs}} = 600 \\text{ widgets per hour}.\n\\]\n\nKnowing this rate lets the business:\n\n* Determine how many workers are needed to keep the line running at target output.  \n* Forecast whether the current capacity can satisfy upcoming orders.  \n* Compare the actual rate to the planned rate (e.g., 550 widgets/hr) to identify inefficiencies and schedule maintenance or process improvements.  \n\nThus, calculating the production rate is essential for resource allocation, inventory planning, and meeting delivery commitments in a business setting."
