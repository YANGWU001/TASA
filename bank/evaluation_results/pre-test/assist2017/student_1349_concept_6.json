      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter of a shape is the total length you\u2019d get if you walked all the way around its outer edge \u2013 basically the sum of the lengths of all its sides (or the distance around a circle).  It\u2019s the \u201cboundary length\u201d of the figure."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a polygon is the total length you would walk if you went all the way around the shape \u2013 you just add up the lengths of all its sides.  Because it\u2019s a \u201cone\u2011dimensional\u201d measure, it\u2019s reported in linear units (cm,\u202fm,\u202finches, etc.).\n\nThe area, on the other hand, is the amount of space inside the polygon.  It\u2019s a \u201ctwo\u2011dimensional\u201d measure and is reported in square units (cm\u00b2,\u202fm\u00b2,\u202fin\u00b2, etc.).  So the two quantities are fundamentally different: one tells you how far around the shape is, the other tells you how much surface it covers.\n\nIn most cases the perimeter is larger than the area (for example, a square with side\u202f2\u202fcm has a perimeter of\u202f8\u202fcm but an area of\u202f4\u202fcm\u00b2), although the exact relationship depends on the shape and its size.  You generally can\u2019t compute one directly from the other unless you know extra information (like the shape being regular)."

      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\) inches."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "The width is \\(5\\text{ cm}\\) and the length is twice that, so  \n\n\\[\n\\text{length}=2 \\times 5\\text{ cm}=10\\text{ cm}.\n\\]\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is  \n\n\\[\nP = 2(\\text{length} + \\text{width}) = 2(10\\text{ cm}+5\\text{ cm}) = 2 \\times 15\\text{ cm}=30\\text{ cm}.\n\\]\n\nSo, the perimeter is **about 30\u202fcm** (I think that\u2019s correct)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a rectangular garden tells you how far the fence has to stretch to go all the way around the edges, so it\u2019s the number you need to figure out how much fencing material you\u2019ll have to buy and how much it will cost.\u202fIn other words, if you know the length and the width, you can add them up (twice each) to get the total distance the fence must cover.  \n\nI think it\u2019s also useful because the perimeter can give you an idea of how much space you\u2019ll have for walking or for putting up garden beds along the fence line\u2014although that part is more about layout than about the actual fence length.  \n\nSometimes people mix up perimeter with area, but the area (length\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth) tells you how much soil or planting space you have, while the perimeter is strictly about the boundary you need to enclose.  \n\nSo, the main reason the perimeter matters for fencing is that it directly determines the amount of fence you need, which in turn affects your budgeting, material ordering, and installation planning."

      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "I think you\u2019d use the circumference formula  \n\n\\[\nC = 2\\pi r\n\\]\n\nso with a radius of\u202f7\u202fcm the perimeter (circumference) would be \\(2\\pi \\times 7\\)\u202fcm."

      "question": "A pentagon has side lengths of 3 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm. What is the total perimeter of the pentagon?",
      "student_answer": "I think the perimeter is the sum of all the side lengths:\n\n\\(3 \\text{ cm} + 5 \\text{ cm} + 4 \\text{ cm} + 6 \\text{ cm} + 2 \\text{ cm} = 20 \\text{ cm}\\).\n\nSo the total perimeter should be **20\u202fcm**."
