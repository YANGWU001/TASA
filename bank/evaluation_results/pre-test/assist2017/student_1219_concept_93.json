      "student_answer": "The basic relationship among rate (speed), distance, and time is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{rate} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}}.\n\\]\n\nIf we need to find the time it takes to travel a certain distance at a given rate, we solve this equation for **time**.  \n\n1. Start with the original formula:  \n\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{d}{t}.\n   \\]\n\n2. Multiply both sides by **t** to get rid of the denominator:  \n\n   \\[\n   r \\, t = d.\n   \\]\n\n3. Finally, isolate **t** by dividing both sides by **r**:  \n\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{d}{r}.\n   \\]\n\nSo, **time = distance \u00f7 rate**.  \nThis rearranged form tells you that to determine how long a trip will take, you divide the total distance you need to travel by the speed (rate) at which you\u2019re moving."

      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011world situation where the rate\u2011distance\u2011time relationship is essential is a **delivery driver planning a day\u2019s route**.\n\n- **Goal:** The driver must deliver packages to several addresses spread across a city and return to the depot before the end of the shift.\n- **What they need to know:**  \n  1. **Distance** between each stop (often obtained from a GPS or map).  \n  2. **Rate** (average speed) they can travel on each road segment, which may vary because of traffic, speed limits, or road conditions.  \n  3. **Time** required to complete each leg of the trip and the total time available (the length of the work shift).\n\n- **How the relationship is used:**  \n  - For each segment, the driver uses the formula\u202f\\( \\text{time} = \\dfrac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{rate}} \\) to estimate how long it will take to travel from one stop to the next.  \n  - By adding up the times for all segments, the driver determines whether the planned route fits within the shift.  \n  - If the total exceeds the available time, the driver must either:  \n    * Increase the average speed where safe and legal,  \n    * Rearrange the order of deliveries to shorten the overall distance, or  \n    * Drop or postpone some deliveries.\n\n- **Why it matters:** Accurate calculations prevent missed delivery windows, overtime costs, and fuel waste. They also help the driver and the logistics company keep customers satisfied and maintain efficient operations.\n\nIn short, understanding how rate, distance, and time interact enables the driver to create realistic schedules, optimize routes, and meet service commitments."
