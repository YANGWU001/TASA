  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of point-plotting but has significant misconceptions, particularly regarding the coordinates and the plotting process. Answers show confusion about the roles of x and y coordinates, and several responses indicate a lack of clarity on fundamental concepts, such as quadrant locations and the distance formula. More practice and clarification on these topics are needed.",

      "question": "What is the process of point-plotting in a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think point\u2011plotting is when you take a pair of numbers like \\((x, y)\\) and just\u2026 put a dot somewhere on a piece of graph paper. You start at the origin \\((0,0)\\), move over \\(x\\) units to the right if \\(x\\) is positive (or left if it\u2019s negative), and then move up \\(y\\) units if \\(y\\) is positive (or down if it\u2019s negative). Then you just\u2026 draw a little dot there.  \n\nSometimes people also draw a little line from the origin to the point, but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s part of the \u201cprocess\u201d or just a way to show the vector. Basically, you just locate the coordinates on the two axes and make a mark.  \n\nI\u2019m not entirely confident about the part with the line\u2011segment, but the main idea is to locate the point using the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) values and place a dot at that spot on the coordinate plane."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How do you determine the coordinates of a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the coordinates by looking at how far the point is from the origin. The number you read **vertically** (up\u2011and\u2011down) is the *x\u2011coordinate*, and the number you read **horizontally** (left\u2011to\u2011right) is the *y\u2011coordinate*. So you just read those two distances off the axes and that gives you the point\u2019s coordinates."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe the difference between the x-coordinate and y-coordinate when plotting a point.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the x\u2011coordinate is the vertical part of a point and the y\u2011coordinate is the horizontal part. So when you plot a point, the first number tells you how far up or down it is, and the second number tells you how far left or right it goes. I'm not completely sure, but that's what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you start at the origin (0,\u202f0) and then you move\u2026 let\u2019s see\u2026 I think you go 6 units **to the right** along the x\u2011axis and then 0 units up. So the point you\u2019d mark would be at (6,\u202f0).  \n\nThe result would tell you that the point lies on the\u202fx\u2011axis, six units away from the origin."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "When plotting points, what is the significance of the origin (0, 0)?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the origin (0,\u202f0) is kind of the \u201chome base\u201d of a coordinate grid. It\u2019s the point where the x\u2011axis and the y\u2011axis cross, so both coordinates are zero there. Usually we use it as a reference point to tell how far away other points are, and we count positive numbers to the right and up, negative numbers to the left and down.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019ve also heard that the origin is sometimes called the \u201ccenter\u201d of the graph, like the place where all the lines intersect, so it\u2019s kind of the middle point for everything. (I think that\u2019s right, but I could be mixing things up.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the distance is\u2026 let\u2019s see\u2026  \n\nWe use the distance formula  \n\\(d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\).  \n\nSo plugging in the points \\((2,5)\\) and \\((-3,-1)\\):  \n\n\\(d = \\sqrt{((-3) - 2)^2 + ((-1) - 5)^2}\\)  \n\\(= \\sqrt{(-5)^2 + (-6)^2}\\)  \n\\(= \\sqrt{25 + 36}\\)  \n\\(= \\sqrt{61}\\).  \n\nBut I think I might have made a mistake with the signs\u2026 maybe it should be \\(\\sqrt{41}\\) instead?  \n\nSo, um, I guess the distance is roughly **\\( \\sqrt{41} \\approx 6.4\\)**."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d start by drawing a set of axes, but you actually put the **y\u2011values on the horizontal axis** and the **x\u2011values on the vertical axis**. Then you just mark each pair from the table by moving over to the y\u2011value first and then up to the x\u2011value, and put a dot there. After you\u2019ve done that for all the rows, you can connect the dots if you want a line. I\u2019m not totally sure about the labeling, but that\u2019s basically how I\u2019d plot the points."
