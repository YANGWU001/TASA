      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a shape is the total length you would travel if you walked all the way around its edge. In other words, you add up the lengths of all its sides (or the distance along its boundary) to get the perimeter. It\u2019s the \u201cboundary length\u201d of the figure."

      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a polygon is the total length around its outside edges, while the area measures how much surface is enclosed inside those edges.\n\n- **Perimeter** \u2013 Add up the lengths of all the sides. It is expressed in linear units (e.g., centimeters, meters, inches).\n- **Area** \u2013 Calculate the amount of space inside the polygon. It is expressed in square units (e.g.,\u202fcm\u00b2,\u202fm\u00b2,\u202fin\u00b2).\n\nSo, the perimeter tells you \u201chow far around\u201d the shape is, whereas the area tells you \u201chow much space\u201d the shape covers."

      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter tells you exactly how long the fence has to be.\u202fFor a rectangular garden the perimeter is the sum of the lengths of the four sides (\u202f\\(2\\ell + 2w\\)\u202f). Knowing this total length lets you:\n\n1. **Buy the right amount of material** \u2013 you won\u2019t run out of fencing or waste extra.\n2. **Estimate the cost** \u2013 most fencing is priced per linear foot or meter, so the perimeter translates directly into price.\n3. **Plan the layout** \u2013 understanding the total boundary helps you decide where gates, posts, or supports should go.\n4. **Ensure coverage** \u2013 the fence must completely enclose the garden; the perimeter guarantees that every side is accounted for.\n\nSo, the perimeter is the key measurement for sizing, budgeting, and installing a fence around a rectangular garden."
