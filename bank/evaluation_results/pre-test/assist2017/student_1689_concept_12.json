      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles because\u2026 well, the formula\u202f\\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\) only makes sense when the two sides are the same length, so you have to have a 45\u2011degree angle or something like that.\u202fIf the triangle isn\u2019t right\u2011angled, the sides don\u2019t line up properly and the squares wouldn\u2019t add up correctly.\u202fSo basically the theorem only fits when the angle between the two legs is exactly 90\u00b0, otherwise the geometry just falls apart and you\u2019d get a different kind of equation.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s why I\u2019ve heard it only applies to right triangles."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think this isn\u2019t a right triangle.  \n\nIf we try to use the Pythagorean Theorem we\u2019d check whether the squares of the two shorter sides add up to the square of the longest side.  \nSo I did:  \n\n\\(6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100\\)  \n\nand then compared that to the square of the longest side:  \n\n\\(10^2 = 100\\).  \n\nBut\u2026 I think I made a mistake somewhere, because 100 doesn\u2019t look right for the longest side. I guess 10 squared should be something like 36, not 100. Since the numbers don\u2019t seem to match, I\u2019d say the triangle is **not** a right triangle.  \n\n(So my justification is that the Pythagorean relationship doesn\u2019t hold here.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the other leg is about **8 units**.  \n\nI tried using the Pythagorean theorem:\u202f\\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\).  So I did something like \\(5^2 + x^2 = 13^2\\) and then kind of guessed that \\(x\\) would be close to 8.  Hopefully that\u2019s right\u2026?"

      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where the Pythagorean Theorem could be used to solve a problem.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place you could use the Pythagorean Theorem is when you\u2019re trying to figure out how much paint you need for a rectangular wall.\u202fIf you know the height of the wall and the width of the wall, you could (I guess) treat those as the two legs of a right\u2011triangle and then use \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\) to get the \u201cdiagonal\u201d length, and then somehow that diagonal tells you the total surface area you have to paint.  \n\nSo, for example, if a wall is 8\u202fft tall and 6\u202fft wide, you\u2019d do \\(8^2 + 6^2 = c^2\\), which gives \\(c = \\sqrt{64 + 36} = \\sqrt{100} = 10\\)\u202fft. Then you\u2019d say the wall needs \u201c10\u202fft\u201d of paint\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure how that works, but that\u2019s the idea I have."

      "question": "Prove the Pythagorean Theorem algebraically using a geometric approach.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019ll try to give a proof of the Pythagorean theorem the way I think it works, but I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s right.\n\nSo\u2026 we start with a right\u2011angled triangle\u202fABC, where the right angle is at C. Let the legs be \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and the hypotenuse be \\(c\\). The usual statement is that \\(a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\\).\n\nThe \u201cgeometric approach\u201d I remember is to draw a big square whose side length is \\((a+b)\\). Inside that square we can fit four copies of the triangle, each placed so that their right angles are at the corners of the big square. That leaves a smaller inner square in the middle. I think the side length of that inner square is \\(c\\), so its area is \\(c^{2}\\).\n\nNow the area of the big square is \\((a+b)^{2}\\). If we add up the areas of the four triangles plus the inner square, that should also equal \\((a+b)^{2}\\). Each triangle has area \\(\\frac12 ab\\), so four of them have total area \\(2ab\\). Then we add the inner square\u2019s area \\(c^{2}\\). So we get\n\n\\[\n(a+b)^{2}=2ab + c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nIf I expand the left side I get \\(a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}\\). So\n\n\\[\na^{2}+2ab+b^{2}=2ab + c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nNow I guess we can subtract the \\(2ab\\) from both sides and we end up with\n\n\\[\na^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}.\n\\]\n\nSo\u2026 that\u2019s the proof, right? We used the big square, the four right\u2011triangles, and the inner square to relate the areas. I hope that makes sense, even though I\u2019m a little shaky on why the inner square\u2019s side is exactly \\(c\\). Maybe it\u2019s because the hypotenuse of each triangle becomes a side of the inner square when we arrange them that way. \n\nI\u2019m not completely confident, but that\u2019s the best I could come up with."
