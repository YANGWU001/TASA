      "student_answer": "The number of ways to choose\u202f\\(r\\)\u202fobjects from a set of\u202f\\(n\\)\u202fobjects (order does not matter) is given by the binomial\u2011coefficient  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\displaystyle \\binom{n}{r}= \\frac{n!}{\\,r!\\,(n-r)!}}\n\\]\n\nwhere \u201c!\u201d denotes factorial.

      "student_answer": "Permutations and combinations are two ways of counting selections from a set, and they differ in whether the order of the chosen items matters.\n\n- **Permutations** count arrangements where the *order* is important.  \n  Example: If you have the letters\u202fA,\u202fB,\u202fC and you want to pick 2 of them, the permutations are AB, BA, AC, CA, BC, CB \u2013 six possibilities because AB and BA are considered different.\n\n- **Combinations** count selections where the *order does not matter*.  \n  Using the same letters and picking 2, the combinations are AB, AC, BC \u2013 only three possibilities because AB and BA are treated as the same choice.\n\nIn short, permutations = \u201cordered selections,\u201d combinations = \u201cunordered selections.\u201d"

      "student_answer": "**Example:**  \nA sprint\u2011coach wants to determine the possible finish orders of the three fastest runners in a 100\u2011meter dash.\n\n**Why this uses permutations (not combinations):**  \n\n- **Order matters.** In a race we care about who finishes first, second, and third. The sequence\u202fA\u2011B\u2011C (runner\u202fA first,\u202fB second,\u202fC third) is a completely different outcome from\u202fC\u2011B\u2011A, even though the same three athletes are involved.  \n- **No repetition.** Each runner can occupy only one place in the finish order, so we are arranging a set of distinct objects.\n\nBecause the outcome is an *arrangement* of the selected runners, the appropriate counting method is a permutation:  \n\n\\[\nP(3,3)=3! = 6 \\text{ possible finish orders.}\n\\]\n\nIf we were only interested in which three runners would be on the podium, regardless of the exact order, we would use combinations instead. Here, the specific ordering of the positions is essential, making permutations the correct tool."

      "student_answer": "To form the teams we only need to choose which 4 of the 7 students will be on team\u202fA; the remaining 3 automatically become team\u202fB.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of ways}= \\binom{7}{4}= \\frac{7!}{4!\\,3!}=35.\n\\]\n\nSo there are **35 different ways** to form the two teams."
