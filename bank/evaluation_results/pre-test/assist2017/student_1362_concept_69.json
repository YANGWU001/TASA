  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of some unit conversions, particularly with kilometers to meters and cups to ounces. However, there are significant errors in converting milliliters to liters and grams to kilograms. The explanations provided show an understanding of the importance of unit conversion in scientific contexts, although some details could be clearer. Overall, the student should focus on improving accuracy in numerical conversions.",

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain why unit conversion is important in scientific experiments.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think unit conversion is important in scientific experiments because it lets everyone use the same \u201clanguage\u201d for measurements.\u202fIf one lab reports a distance in meters and another reports it in feet, you have to convert so you can actually compare the results and see if they agree.  \n\nI also guess that converting units can help avoid mistakes\u2014like if you accidentally mix up milligrams with grams you could end up using the wrong amount of a chemical, which would mess up the whole experiment.\n\n\u2026and, maybe, it makes the numbers easier to handle?\u202fSometimes scientists change a very large number of seconds into hours or minutes just so the data looks \u201cnicer\u201d on a graph.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019ve heard that using the right units can also keep the equipment calibrated correctly, because some instruments only accept inputs in specific units (like a thermometer that expects Celsius, not Kelvin). \n\nSo, overall, converting units helps keep experiments consistent, comparable, and (I think) prevents the wrong amounts or settings from being used."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Describe the process of converting units between different measurement systems, such as metric to imperial.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the way you change from metric to imperial is kind of like\u2026 you first look up the conversion factor for the unit you want, and then you either multiply or divide by that number.\u202fFor example, I remember that 1\u202finch is about 2.5\u202fcentimeters, so if you have 10\u202fcm you\u2019d *multiply* by 2.5 to get inches\u2014so 10\u202fcm would be about 25\u202finches, right?  \n\nThen you\u2019re supposed to round to the nearest whole number, and sometimes you have to add a little extra because the systems are \u201cdifferent.\u201d\u202fIf you\u2019re going the other way, like from miles to kilometers, you just flip the fraction and multiply again.\u202fI think you also need to check a chart to make sure you\u2019re using the right \u201ctype\u201d of conversion, like volume versus length, because the numbers change.\u202fAnd sometimes you have to use a calculator to do the division, especially if the number is a decimal.  \n\nSo basically: find the factor, do the math (multiply or divide), round, and you\u2019re done.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure about the exact numbers, but that\u2019s the general idea."
