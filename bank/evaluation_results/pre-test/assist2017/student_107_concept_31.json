  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of transversals, but there are significant misconceptions, especially regarding the definitions and relationships of angles. Key concepts like corresponding angles and the properties of alternate angles need clarification. The student should focus on accurately defining terms and understanding the relationships between angles formed by transversals.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is a transversal in geometry?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a transversal is a line that\u2019s kind of *parallel* to two other lines, so it runs alongside them without actually crossing them. I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, how many angles are formed at the points of intersection?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think maybe there are **four** angles in total formed where the transversal meets the two parallel lines.  (I'm not really sure, though.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Define the relationship between corresponding angles when a transversal crosses two parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when a transversal cuts two parallel lines the corresponding angles are\u2026 well, I guess they\u2019re kind of related by adding up to a straight line, so maybe they\u2019re supplementary? Like each pair of corresponding angles sums to 180\u00b0.  \n\nI could be wrong, though\u2026"

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you identify alternate interior angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think alternate interior angles are the angles that are **outside** the two parallel lines and on the **same** side of the transversal. So when a transversal cuts two parallel lines, you look for the pair of angles that lie away from the region between the lines but both on the left (or both on the right) of the transversal\u2014those are the alternate interior angles. Usually you can spot them because they\u2019re the ones that look alike, and you just note that they\u2019re equal. \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What is the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal crossing two parallel lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the interior angles you get inside the parallel lines add up to\u2026 maybe 360 degrees? I'm not totally sure, but that sounds right."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object or situation where transversals are observable.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a good everyday example of a transversal is a ladder leaning against a wall.  \n\nThe ladder is like a straight line that meets the floor (one line) and the wall (another line) at the same time, so it \u201ccrosses\u201d those two lines.\u202fSo you can picture the floor and the wall as two lines that are kind of at right angles, and the ladder is the line that cuts across both of them\u2014that\u2019s a transversal, right?  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the textbook definition, but it seems to fit the idea of a line intersecting two other lines in a real\u2011world situation."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain how a transversal can create pairs of supplementary angles when intersecting parallel lines.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a transversal is just any line that cuts across two other lines, right? So when it crosses two parallel lines, it makes a bunch of angles at the intersection points.  \n\nI guess the idea is that the angles that are on the same side of the transversal and inside the parallel lines\u2026 they\u2019re called\u2026 interior angles? And those two interior angles should add up to 180 degrees, which is what we call supplementary. So the transversal creates a pair of supplementary angles by just\u2026 being there, I guess.  \n\nMaybe it\u2019s also the case that the angles on the outside of the parallel lines, like the ones next to the interior ones, are also supplementary? I\u2019m not really sure which ones exactly, but I think any two angles that share a vertex on the transversal and are on opposite sides of the parallel lines end up adding to 180\u00b0.  \n\nBasically, the transversal just forces the angles to line up so that the sum is 180\u00b0, making them supplementary pairs. I\u2019m not completely confident about the names of the angles, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the difference between alternate interior angles and alternate exterior angles in the context of transversals?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the \u201calternate interior\u201d angles are the ones that lie **outside** the two parallel lines, on opposite sides of the transversal, and the \u201calternate exterior\u201d angles are the ones that are **between** the two lines, also on opposite sides of the transversal.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, though."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the corresponding angle would be the *supplement* of the given one, so maybe it\u2019s about **110\u00b0**.  (I'm not really sure.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Why are vertical angles formed by transversals always equal in measure?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think vertical angles are equal because they\u2019re opposite each other across the intersecting lines, and the transversal kind of \u201csplits\u201d the two lines the same way on both sides. So the two angles end up having the same measure since they\u2019re formed by the same two lines meeting at a point.\u202f(I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
