      "question": "What is the formula for calculating the number of combinations when choosing r items from a set of n items?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the formula is something like  \n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{r}= \\frac{n!}{r!\\,(n+r)!}\n\\]\n\n\u2014 I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain the difference between permutations and combinations in your own words.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of the opposite of what most people say. A **permutation** is when you\u2019re just picking a group of objects and the order doesn\u2019t really matter\u2014like you just choose three letters out of the alphabet and it doesn\u2019t matter which one comes first.  \n\nA **combination**, on the other hand, is when the order does matter, so you have to line them up in a specific way. For example, if you\u2019re making a password, the sequence of the characters matters, so that would be a combination.  \n\nSo basically, permutations ignore order and combinations care about order."

      "question": "If a committee of 3 people is to be selected from a group of 10, how many different committees can be formed?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the number of ways to pick 3 people out of 10 is just \\( \\frac{10 \\times 3}{2} = 30\\). So there would be about **30 different committees**."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "A password consists of 4 letters chosen from the English alphabet. If repetitions are allowed, how many different passwords can be created?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number of possible passwords is... maybe 26\u202f\u00d7\u202f4? So I guess there are **104** different passwords."

      "question": "In a lottery, 6 numbers are chosen from a pool of 49 numbers. How many different combinations of numbers are possible?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think the number of possible combinations is **about 12,271,512**."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If you have 8 distinct objects, how many ways can you select and arrange 3 of them?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the number of ways to pick and line up 3 of the 8 distinct objects is the combination\u202fC(8,\u202f3). So I\u2019d say it\u2019s  \n\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{3}= \\frac{8\\cdot7\\cdot6}{3\\cdot2\\cdot1}=56.\n\\]\n\nSo, 56 possible ways."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where permutations would be used instead of combinations, and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a real\u2011world example where you\u2019d use permutations instead of combinations is like picking a lottery ticket. Say you have to pick three numbers from 1 to 50, and the order in which you write them on the ticket matters\u2014so \u201c5\u201112\u201130\u201d is different from \u201c30\u201112\u20115\u201d. In that case you\u2019d use permutations because the sequence (the order) changes the outcome, whereas if you were just choosing a set of numbers without caring about order you\u2019d use combinations. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but the idea is that the ordering of the selected items matters, so you count each different arrangement as a separate outcome."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, how would you calculate the number of outcomes that satisfy at least one of two conditions?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the inclusion\u2013exclusion thing for \u201cat least one of the two conditions\u201d is just to add the two counts and also add the overlap. So I\u2019d say the number of outcomes is  \n\n\\[\n|A| \\;+\\; |B| \\;+\\; |A\\cap B|.\n\\]  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like to me.)"
