  "feedback": "The student has a limited understanding of the sum of interior angles in polygons. They correctly identified the sum for a 5-sided polygon and provided the correct formula in Question 10, but made several errors in other calculations and explanations. The student should focus on understanding the correct formula and how to apply it consistently.",

      "question": "How many sides does a polygon have if the sum of its interior angles is 1080 degrees?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum\u202f1080\u00b0 would be for a polygon with\u2026 maybe 12 sides?  I\u2019m not really sure, but that sounds about right."

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a polygon increases as the number of sides increases.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the sum of the interior angles gets bigger when you add more sides is because each side sort of \u201cadds\u201d a whole 180\u2011degree angle to the shape. So, if you have a triangle, you have three 180\u2011degree pieces, which would be 540\u202fdegrees total, but actually a triangle only has 180\u202fdegrees, so maybe you subtract something\u2026 I guess for a quadrilateral you\u2019d have four of those 180\u2011degree pieces, which would be 720\u202fdegrees, and that\u2019s why a square has a sum of 720\u202fdegrees. \n\nSo basically, the more sides you have, the more 180\u2011degree \u201cchunks\u201d you add, and that makes the total interior angle sum increase. I\u2019m not totally sure how the subtraction works, but I think it\u2019s just a matter of adding another 180 degrees each time you add a side."

      "question": "What is the relationship between the number of sides of a polygon and the sum of its interior angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles is just 180\u00b0 times the number of sides. So for a polygon with\u202fn\u202fsides, the total would be about \\(180n\\) degrees. (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How does the sum of the interior angles of a polygon differ from the sum of the exterior angles?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two sums are kind of similar but not exactly the same.\u202fThe interior angles of a polygon add up to something like \\((n-2)\\times180^\\circ\\)\u202f\u2014\u202fyou know, because you can divide it into triangles.\u202fAs for the exterior angles, I think they also add up to \\((n-2)\\times180^\\circ\\)\u202f\u2026 or maybe they add up to 360\u00b0?\u202fI\u2019m not really sure which one is right.\u202fMy guess is that the interior sum grows with the number of sides, while the exterior sum stays constant, but I could be mixing them up.  (Sorry if that\u2019s confusing!)"

      "question": "Describe the process for determining the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with more than 3 sides.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you find the sum of the interior angles is to take the number of sides, add 2, and then multiply by 180\u00b0. So for a polygon with *n* sides you\u2019d do  \n\n\\[\n(\\,n+2\\,)\\times 180^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nI guess that gives you the total interior angle measure\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
