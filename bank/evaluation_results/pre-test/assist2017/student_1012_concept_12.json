      "question": "Explain why the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles is because the theorem was *invented* for triangles that have a 90\u2011degree angle.\u202fSince the sides that meet at that right angle are called the \u201clegs,\u201d the theorem just adds the squares of those two legs together and sets them equal to the square of the third side.\u202fIf the angle isn\u2019t exactly 90\u00b0, the relationship breaks down because the sides are no longer perpendicular, so the squares don\u2019t line up the same way.\n\nI guess\u2026 the geometry behind it only holds when the two shorter sides are perpendicular, because the proof uses the fact that the area of the square on the hypotenuse can be split into two smaller squares that sit perfectly next to each other. If the angle were anything else, those squares would overlap or leave gaps, so the equation\u202f\\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\) wouldn\u2019t be true anymore.\n\nSo, basically\u2026 it\u2019s just a rule that only fits when you have that right angle, otherwise you need a different formula. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think this triangle is **not** a right triangle.  \n\nIf we try to use the Pythagorean theorem, we\u2019d check whether the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides equals the square of the longest side.  \n\nSo I did:  \n\n- \\(6^2 = 36\\)  \n- \\(8^2 = 64\\)  \n\nAdding those gives \\(36 + 64 = 100\\).  \n\nBut then I looked at the longest side, which is 10, and its square is \\(10^2 = 20\\) (I think I got that wrong \u2013 maybe it\u2019s 100?). Since \\(100\\) does **not** equal \\(20\\), the condition \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\) is not satisfied, so the triangle can\u2019t be a right triangle.  \n\nTherefore, the triangle with sides 6, 8, and 10 is not a right triangle.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one way to use the Pythagorean Theorem in real life is\u2026 to figure out how much paint you need for a wall.\u202fIf you know the height of the wall (let\u2019s call that side\u202fa) and the width of the wall (side\u202fb), you can \u201cadd\u201d them together to get the total area you have to paint.\u202fSo you\u2019d do something like  \n\n\\[\na + b = c\n\\]\n\nwhere\u202fc\u202fwould be the amount of paint in gallons.\u202fIn other words, you just add the two dimensions and that tells you how much surface you have to cover.\u202fThis is kind of like using the theorem to get the \u201cdiagonal\u201d of the wall, which tells you the total paint needed. \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s the idea I\u2019ve heard."

      "question": "Prove the Pythagorean Theorem algebraically using a geometric approach.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019ll try to give a proof, but I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s right.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s take a right\u2011angled triangle with legs\u202f$a$ and\u202f$b$ and hypotenuse\u202f$c$. The geometric idea is to draw the three squares on each side of the triangle. So we have a square of area $a^2$ on the side $a$, a square of area $b^2$ on the side $b$, and a square of area $c^2$ on the side $c$.\n\nNow, I think we can rearrange the two smaller squares inside the big one. If we cut the square on $a$ into two right\u2011triangles and move them next to the square on $b$, they will somehow fill up the square on $c$. So the total area of the two small squares should equal the area of the big square:\n\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 = c^2 .\n\\]\n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not sure about the exact cutting. Maybe we should rotate the triangles 90 degrees and slide them along the edges of the $c$\u2011square. When you do that, the two pieces line up exactly with the sides of the $c$ square, so you get the same area.\n\nAnother way (I think) is to use coordinates. Put the right triangle with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(a,0)$ and $(0,b)$. The length of the hypotenuse is the distance between $(a,0)$ and $(0,b)$, which is $\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$, so the area of the square on the hypotenuse is $(\\sqrt{a^2+b^2})^2 = a^2 + b^2$. Therefore the area of the $c$\u2011square equals the sum of the areas of the two smaller squares, which gives the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m not sure if the rearrangement part is completely correct \u2013 I might have mixed up which pieces go where. Also, the coordinate argument seems a bit hand\u2011wavy; I think we\u2019re supposed to square the distance formula, but I could be wrong about the signs. \n\nSo, um\u2026 that\u2019s my attempt at an algebraic\u2011geometric proof. I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on the details, but hopefully it\u2019s *some* kind of proof."
