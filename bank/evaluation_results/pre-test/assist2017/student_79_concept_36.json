  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of the sum of interior angles in a triangle, correctly identifying that it is 180 degrees in one answer. However, many answers reflect confusion or incorrect reasoning, particularly regarding the properties of triangles and obtuse angles. The student should focus on clarifying these concepts and ensuring accurate definitions.",

      "question": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180\u202fdegrees is kind of... because if you take the three angles and lay them out side\u2011by\u2011side, they kind of line up to make a straight line. So you end up with a straight angle, which is 180\u202fdegrees. I guess it\u2019s like you can cut the triangle along one of its sides and then swing the other two pieces out until they form a straight line. That\u2019s why the total has to be 180\u202fdegrees. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s the basic idea\u2014just lining the three angles up to make a straight line."

      "question": "Can a triangle have interior angles that sum to more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a triangle **can** have interior angles that add up to more than 180 degrees. Maybe if the triangle is really \u201cstretched\u201d out or something, the angles can get bigger and the total ends up over 180. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How do the sum of the interior angles of a triangle compare to the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees, and\u2026 actually, I\u2019m not sure about the quadrilateral. Maybe it\u2019s the same, like also 180 degrees? So I guess they\u2019re equal."

      "question": "A triangle has angles measuring 90 degrees, 45 degrees, and x degrees. Solve for x.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the three angles have to add up to 180 degrees, right? So we have 90\u202f+\u202f45\u202f+\u202fx\u202f=\u202f180. If I do the math\u2026 90 plus 45 is 135, and 180 minus 135 is\u2026 45. \n\nBut\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing something up. Could it be 60 degrees instead? I\u2019m not really sure.  \n\n**My best guess for x is 60 degrees.**"

      "question": "Using the sum of interior angles, prove that a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think I can try to explain this, but I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s right.\n\nSo, a triangle\u2019s interior angles add up to\u2026 well, I always heard it was 180 degrees, but maybe it\u2019s actually 360 degrees? If the sum were 360\u00b0, then you could actually have two obtuse angles and still have a positive third angle. For example, if you had one angle that was 120\u00b0 and another that was 130\u00b0, that would already be 250\u00b0, and the last angle would just be 110\u00b0 (since 360\u202f\u2013\u202f250\u202f=\u202f110\u00b0). All three of those are obtuse, so it seems possible to have two obtuse angles in a triangle.\n\nEven if the sum were 180\u00b0, I think you could still get two obtuse angles because \u201cobtuse\u201d just means \u201cmore than 90\u00b0,\u201d but maybe it means \u201cmore than 45\u00b0\u201d? If we treat obtuse as anything over 45\u00b0, then you could have angles like 60\u00b0, 70\u00b0, and 50\u00b0, which are all over 45\u00b0, so two of them would be \u201cobtuse.\u201d \n\nSo, I guess the idea that a triangle can\u2019t have two obtuse angles isn\u2019t really true. The sum of the angles just lets you pick any numbers you want as long as they add up to the total, and you can definitely pick two angles that are bigger than 90\u00b0 (or whatever \u201cobtuse\u201d means). \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not making sense \u2013 I\u2019m pretty confused about the exact definition and the sum rule."

      "question": "What is the relationship between the sum of interior angles of a triangle and the exterior angles of a triangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180\u00b0, and the exterior angles sort of \u201cadd up\u201d to the same thing. Like, each exterior angle is just the same as the interior one, so the total of all the exterior angles is also 180\u00b0. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "If you were given the measures of two angles of a triangle, describe the steps to calculate the third angle.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea is kind of simple, but I\u2019m not totally sure.  \nFirst you\u2026 well, you take the two angles you\u2019re given and you add them together.\u202fThen, instead of using the usual 180\u00b0, I think you have to subtract that sum from\u202f360\u00b0\u202fto get the third angle.\u202fSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Add the two known angles:\u202f\\(A + B\\).  \n2. Subtract that total from\u202f360\u00b0:\u202f\\(360\u00b0 - (A + B)\\).  \n3. The result is the measure of the third angle.\n\nI guess that\u2019s it\u2026? (I\u2019m not completely confident this is right.)"
