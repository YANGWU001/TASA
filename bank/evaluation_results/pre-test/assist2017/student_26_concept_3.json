  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of rotations but has significant misconceptions, particularly regarding the effects of rotation on distances and the importance of direction. They correctly identify some coordinate transformations but struggle with the details and implications of those transformations. More practice and clarification on the properties of rotations are needed.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is a rotation in geometry, and how does it differ from other transformations?",
      "student_answer": "Um, a rotation\u2026 I think it\u2019s when you turn a shape around a fixed point, kind of like spinning a wheel. You pick a center point and an angle, and every point of the figure moves along a circular path about that center.  \n\nAnd\u2026 it\u2019s different from other transformations because\u2026 well, a translation just slides the shape without turning it, and a reflection flips it over a line. Those don\u2019t involve any turning around a point, right? So a rotation is the only one that actually \u201cspins\u201d the shape.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the details, but that\u2019s what I remember."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a shape is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin, what happens to the coordinates of its points?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think when you rotate a shape 90 degrees clockwise around the origin, the coordinates sort of swap places but with a sign change. So a point \\((x, y)\\) would end up at something like \\((-y,\\; x)\\).  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, though\u2014maybe I\u2019ve got the signs mixed up."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Describe the characteristics that remain unchanged after a rotation transformation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think after a rotation the picture keeps the same colors and the same area, but the distances between points actually get bigger.  So basically the only things that stay unchanged are the overall colour and the total area of the shape, while everything else \u2013 like the lengths of the sides or the angles \u2013 can change."

      "question": "A triangle has vertices at (2, 3), (5, 3), and (4, 6). Rotate it 180 degrees about the origin. What are the new coordinates of the vertices?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 after a 180\u00b0 rotation about the origin each point just gets its signs flipped, but I\u2019m not totally sure I did the arithmetic right. So the new vertices would be:\n\n- (2,\u202f3) \u2192 (\u20112,\u202f\u20113)  \n- (5,\u202f3) \u2192 (\u20115,\u202f\u20113)  \n- (4,\u202f6) \u2192 (\u20114,\u202f6)\n\n\u2026I think that\u2019s about right."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of a rotation affects the resulting position of a shape.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the direction of the rotation doesn\u2019t really change where the shape ends up, it just sort of flips it. Like, whether you turn it clockwise or counter\u2011clockwise, the shape will still be in the same spot after the rotation \u2013 it\u2019s just\u2026 maybe the line you draw looks different, but the final position is the same. So I guess the direction isn\u2019t that important for the final location of the shape."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How would you describe the rotation of a point (x, y) 90 degrees counterclockwise about the origin in terms of its new coordinates?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think when you rotate a point\u202f(x,\u202fy)\u202f90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise about the origin, the new coordinates become **(y,\u202f\u2011x)**."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a rotation of 360 degrees and no rotation at all?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there is actually a difference. A 360\u2011degree rotation makes the object spin all the way around once, so it\u2019s kind of \u201cturned\u201d even though it ends up where it started. That\u2019s not exactly the same as doing nothing at all."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "A square is rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise about its center. Will the square's orientation change? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the square\u2019s orientation actually doesn\u2019t change. Since we\u2019re rotating it about its own centre, the shape stays a square and it still \u201clooks the same\u201d \u2013 just turned into a diamond\u2011shaped picture of a square. So even after a 45\u2011degree counter\u2011clockwise turn the orientation is effectively unchanged."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a rotation is performed about a point other than the origin, how does this affect the outcome of the transformation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think rotating about some other point doesn\u2019t really change the transformation. It\u2019s still just a rotation, so the shape ends up in the same orientation as if you\u2019d spun it around the origin\u2014only the numbers in the coordinates might look a little different, but the picture itself doesn\u2019t move to a new location."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world object that demonstrates rotation and explain how it is similar to geometric rotation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a good everyday example might be a ceiling fan.\u202fWhen the fan blades spin, the whole thing turns around the pole in the middle, sort of like a geometric rotation.\u202fIn geometry we usually talk about rotating a shape around a point, but with the fan it\u2019s a line (the pole) that everything goes around, so the points on the blades all move in circles just like the points of a shape would when you rotate it.\u202fI guess the idea is that the angles between the blades stay the same, kind of like how a geometric rotation keeps all angles and distances the same, even though the fan is moving in real space.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
