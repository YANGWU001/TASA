      "student_answer": "Multiplication is a way of adding the same number many times.  \nIf you have\u202f*3* groups of\u202f*4* objects, instead of counting each object one by one (4\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f4), you multiply 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 to get\u202f12. In other words, multiplication combines equal groups to find the total amount, and it can also be thought of as scaling one number by another."

      "student_answer": "Yes, \\(0 \\times 5 = 0\\).\n\nMultiplication can be thought of as repeated addition.  \n\\(0 \\times 5\\) means \u201cadd 0 together five times\u201d:\n\n\\[\n0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.\n\\]\n\nSince adding zero any number of times never changes the total, the product is 0. In general, any number multiplied by 0 always yields 0. This follows from the distributive property of multiplication over addition and the definition of zero as the additive identity."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Using repeated addition, show why 3 \u00d7 4 = 12.",
      "student_answer": "To see why \\(3 \\times 4\\) equals 12, write the product as repeated addition.  \nThe expression \\(3 \\times 4\\) means \u201cadd the number\u202f3 together four times\u201d (or equivalently, add 4 together three times).  \n\n\\[\n3 \\times 4 \\;=\\; 3 + 3 + 3 + 3\n\\]\n\nNow add the three\u2011s:\n\n\\[\n3 + 3 = 6 \\\\\n6 + 3 = 9 \\\\\n9 + 3 = 12\n\\]\n\nThus the sum of four\u202f3\u2019s is 12, so  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3 \\times 4 = 12}\n\\]"
