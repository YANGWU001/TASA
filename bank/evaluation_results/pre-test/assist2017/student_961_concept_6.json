      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 3 units?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is\u2026 maybe 24 units? I'm not really sure."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what the term 'perimeter' means.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think perimeter is kind of like the space inside a shape\u2014like its area\u2014so it\u2019s the amount of \u201cstuff\u201d that the shape covers rather than the length of the sides.  (I\u2019m not really sure.)"

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a triangle has sides measuring 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm, what is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is about **20\u202fcm**.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 4 meters each.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is maybe 12\u202fmeters."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How is the perimeter of a polygon different from its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter of a polygon is just the total length you get if you add up all the sides, kind of like measuring the \u201cborder\u201d around it. The area, on the other hand, is supposed to be the amount of space inside the shape, like how much paper you could cover with it. \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014maybe the perimeter also has something to do with the number of sides, and the area might be related to the angles instead? Sorry, I\u2019m a bit confused."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A regular hexagon has side lengths of 6 inches. What is its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the perimeter is probably 30\u202finches."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Find the perimeter of a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the width is 5 cm.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the width is 5\u202fcm, so the length would be twice that, 10\u202fcm.  \nThen the perimeter is \\(2 \\times ( \\text{length} + \\text{width} ) = 2 \\times (10 + 5)\\).  \nMaybe I\u2019m mixing something up\u2026 I guess the perimeter is about **20\u202fcm**."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is the perimeter important when fencing a rectangular garden?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the perimeter is kind of important because it tells you how much fence you\u2019ll need to go all the way around the garden.\u202fBut\u2026 I guess it\u2019s also about how much soil you have to fill in, since the fence tells you the \u201cedge\u201d of the garden and that somehow relates to the amount of space inside.\u202fSo, yeah, the perimeter helps you figure out the fence length\u2026 and, I think, also the amount of soil you\u2019ll need."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a circle has a radius of 7 cm, what formula would you use to calculate its perimeter?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the formula for the perimeter of a circle is just the area formula, so it would be  \n\n**\u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202fr\u00b2**  \n\nso with a radius of 7\u202fcm it would be \u03c0\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u00b2."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the perimeter is... let me add them up\u2026 3\u202f+\u202f5\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f2\u2026 maybe that\u2019s 22\u202fcm?  (I'm not totally sure.)"
