  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a significant misunderstanding of percentages. Most answers are incorrect, indicating a lack of understanding of basic percentage calculations and conversions. The only correct answer is for the sugar calculation, where the student correctly identified 60% of 500 grams as 300 grams. The student should focus on understanding the fundamental concepts of percentages, including how to calculate percentages of numbers and convert fractions to percentages.",

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 if the population goes up by 10\u202f%, you\u2019d add about 5 people (since 10\u202f% of 500 is\u2026 I guess 5?), so the new total would be roughly **505** people."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sugar would be 200\u202fgrams. I'm not really sure, but that seems about right for 60\u202f% of 500\u202fg."

      "question": "If a car's value decreases by 15% each year, what will its value be after 2 years if it originally costs $10,000?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you just subtract 15\u202f% each year straight from the original price. So after the first year it\u2019s $10,000\u202f\u2212\u202f$1,500\u202f=\u202f$8,500, and after the second year you\u2019d subtract another $1,500, giving about **$7,000**. (I'm not totally sure.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you find \u201cthe percentage of a number\u201d is kind of the opposite of what you usually do with percentages.  \n\nFirst you take the percent you want (let\u2019s say 25\u202f%) and you **divide** the original number by that percent. So if you want 25\u202f% of 80, you\u2019d do  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{80}{25}=3.2\n\\]\n\nand then you somehow multiply that by 100 to get the final answer\u2026 I guess that would give you 320, which is\u2026 well, maybe that\u2019s the \u201cpercentage\u201d you were looking for?  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the steps are:  \n\n1. Write the percent as a plain number (like 25 for 25\u202f%).  \n2. Divide the original number by that number.  \n3. Multiply the result by 100 to get the \u201cpercentage of the number.\u201d  \n\nSo, \u201c25\u202f% of 80\u201d would be \u2026 320?  I\u2019m pretty confused, sorry!"
