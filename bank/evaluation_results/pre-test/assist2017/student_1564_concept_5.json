Consequently the resulting unit is the square of the unit of length, which we write as a \u201csquare\u201d unit to remind us that we are dealing with a two\u2011dimensional measure."

      "question": "Give one real-life example of where calculating area is important and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "One everyday situation where calculating area is crucial is **painting a wall** (or a ceiling).  \n\n**Why it matters:**  \n- To know how much paint to buy, you first need the total surface area that will be covered.  \n- Paint cans are labeled with the coverage they provide (e.g., \u201ccovers\u202f350\u202fsq\u202fft per gallon\u201d). By dividing the wall\u2019s area by the coverage rate, you can estimate the number of gallons (or liters) required.  \n- If you underestimate the area, you\u2019ll run out of paint mid\u2011project; if you overestimate, you\u2019ll waste money buying more paint than necessary.  \n\nSo, measuring the length and height of the wall, multiplying them to get the area, and then using that figure to plan the paint purchase is a practical example of why area calculations are important in daily life."
