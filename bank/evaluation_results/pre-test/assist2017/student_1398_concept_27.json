      "question": "What percent is equivalent to the fraction 2/5?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s maybe around **30\u202f%**. I'm not totally sure, but that seems close."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If a fraction is 5/8, what is its equivalent percent?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... let's see. If the fraction is\u202f5\u20448, you can divide 5 by 8 to get a decimal. I\u2019m not super sure, but I think\u202f5 \u00f7 8\u202fis about\u202f0.55, so maybe that\u2019s like\u202f55\u202fpercent?  So, I guess the equivalent percent is roughly **55\u202f%**."

      "question": "True or False: 1/2, 0.5, and 50% all represent the same value.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it's false. 1/2 is a fraction, 0.5 is a decimal, and 50\u202f% is a percent, so they\u2019re different, right?"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A student claims that 0.2 and 1/4 are equivalent. Is the student correct? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the student is actually right.\u202f0.2 can be written as a fraction by putting it over 10, so 0.2\u202f=\u202f2\u204410.  If you simplify 2\u204410 you get \u2026 well, I guess you could say it\u2019s 1\u20444 because 2 divided by 2 is 1 and 10 divided by 2 is 5, and 5 is kind of close to 4\u2026?  So, yeah, 0.2 and 1\u20444 are equivalent. \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it looks like to me.)"
