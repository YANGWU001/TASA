  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of percentages but struggles with basic calculations and concepts. They correctly identified the sale price in Question 2, the new population in Question 5, the value after depreciation in Question 9, and the process of finding a percentage in Question 10. However, they made significant errors in the other questions, indicating a need for further practice and clarification on percentage calculations.",

I guess $10?), so the sale price would be $50 minus $10, which is\u2026 $40? \n\nOr\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing something up and it\u2019s actually $35? I\u2019m not really sure. \n\nProbably the sale price is $40."

So maybe it\u2019s about $8,500\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.85\u202f\u2248\u202f$7,250. I'm not totally sure, but that seems close."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way to find the percentage of a number is kind of the opposite of what we usually do.\u202fYou take the percent you\u2019re given, divide it **by** the number you want the part of, and then multiply by 100. \n\nSo, for example, if you wanted to find 20\u202f% of 50, you\u2019d do:\n\n1.\u202f20\u202f\u00f7\u202f50\u202f=\u202f0.4  \n2.\u202f0.4\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202f=\u202f40  \n\nSo the answer would be 40.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class.  (Sorry if I\u2019m mixing something up!)"
