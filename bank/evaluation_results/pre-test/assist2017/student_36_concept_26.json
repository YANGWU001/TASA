    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is a Venn diagram used for?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram is kind of like a decorative picture of a bunch of circles.\u202fIt\u2019s mainly used for drawing nice, overlapping circles on a page, not really for comparing sets or anything like that."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Describe the components of a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the parts of a Venn diagram are kind of\u2026 weird. Usually there\u2019s a big rectangle that\u2019s the \u201cuniversal set,\u201d and inside it you draw a bunch of squares for each set. The squares overlap to show where the sets share things, and the overlapping parts are called intersections. Sometimes you also put little triangles in the corners to show differences, and the whole thing is labeled with the set names at the top. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s how it works."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does a Venn diagram visually represent relationships between sets?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram just draws each set as a separate circle, and the parts where the circles overlap are actually the **union** of the sets. The parts that don\u2019t overlap are the intersections, I guess. It\u2019s a way to picture how the sets relate to each other."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Provide an example of a real-world scenario where a Venn diagram would be useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a Venn diagram could be used for something like figuring out how many people in a city drive either a car, a bike, or both. So you\u2019d draw one circle for \u201ccar drivers\u201d and another for \u201cbike riders\u201d and the overlap would be the folks who use both a car and a bike.  \n\nI'm not totally sure that\u2019s the best example, but maybe it shows how the groups intersect."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If two sets in a Venn diagram have no overlap, what does this signify?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if two circles don\u2019t overlap it means the sets are actually the same set \u2013 like they\u2019re identical and just drawn apart for some reason."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How can you determine the union of two sets using a Venn diagram?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the union of two sets is the part that\u2019s **outside** the circles on a Venn diagram. So, if you draw two overlapping circles, you\u2019d shade everything **except** the circles themselves\u2014that\u2019s supposed to represent everything that belongs to either set, right? I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess you just leave the overlapping part unshaded and shade the rest of the diagram."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "In a three-set Venn diagram, what does the intersection of all three sets represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the intersection of all three sets is actually the part that\u2019s outside the circles \u2013 like the area that doesn\u2019t belong to any of the sets. I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m guessing."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Draw a Venn diagram to compare and contrast two animals of your choice.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019ll try to sketch a Venn diagram comparing a **lion** and a **tiger**.\n\n```\n               _____________\n              /             \\\n            /   Lion only    \\\n           |  - lives in      |\n           |    Africa        |\n           |  - eats grass    <-- (I think lions eat grass, but maybe that\u2019s wrong)\n           |  - has a mane    |\n            \\               /\n             \\   _________  /\n               \\         /\n                \\_______/\n               /       \\\n              / Tiger   \\\n             /  only     \\\n            |  - lives in |\n            |    Antarctica |\n            |  - stripes   |\n            |  - nocturnal |\n             \\           /\n              \\_________/\n```\n\nSo the left circle (lion) has the things I wrote only for lions, the right circle (tiger) has the things only for tigers, and the overlapping part in the middle would be the things they share, like:\n\n- **Both are big cats**\n- **Both are carnivores** (though I\u2019m not totally sure)\n- **Both have sharp teeth**\n\nI\u2019m not really confident about the \u201ceats grass\u201d part for the lion, and I think tigers live in Antarctica, which probably isn\u2019t right either. Sorry if this is a mess!"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain how the complement of a set is shown in a Venn diagram.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the complement of a set is the part that\u2019s *inside* the circle, the part that\u2019s shaded, right? So if you have a universal set drawn as a big rectangle and you draw a circle for set\u202fA, the complement\u202f\\(A'\\) would be the area **inside** that circle that isn\u2019t covered by any other sets. You\u2019d just shade the whole circle to show the complement. \n\n(If I\u2019m mixing things up, sorry\u2014this is what I remember from class.)"
