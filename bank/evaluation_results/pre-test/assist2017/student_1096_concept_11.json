      "question": "Explain how proportions can be used to solve real-world problems like scaling a recipe.",
      "student_answer": "Sure, I\u2019ll try to explain how proportions help when you want to change the size of a recipe.\n\nA proportion is just a comparison of two ratios that are equal.  \nWhen you scale a recipe you\u2019re keeping the **ratio** between each ingredient and the total amount of the dish the same.  \nSo you can set up a proportion like this:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{original amount of ingredient}}{\\text{original total}} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\text{new amount of ingredient}}{\\text{new total}}\n\\]\n\nFrom that you solve for the \u201cnew amount of ingredient.\u201d  \n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step (what I think is right):**\n\n1. **Find the scaling factor.**  \n   Divide the size you want by the size the original recipe makes.  \n   For example, if the original recipe makes 4 servings and you need 10 servings, the factor is  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{10}{4}=2.5.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Apply the factor to each ingredient.**  \n   Multiply every ingredient amount by 2.5.  \n   So if the original calls for 1\u202fcup of flour, you\u2019d need  \n   \\[\n   1 \\text{ cup} \\times 2.5 = 2.5 \\text{ cups}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Check the proportion.**  \n   You can write a quick proportion to see it makes sense:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1\\text{ cup flour}}{4\\text{ servings}} = \\frac{2.5\\text{ cups flour}}{10\\text{ servings}}.\n   \\]  \n   Both sides equal 0.25\u202fcup per serving, so the recipe stays balanced.\n\n4. **Scaling down.**  \n   If you need fewer servings, you do the same thing but the factor will be less than 1.  \n   For instance, halving a 6\u2011serving recipe to 3 servings gives a factor of \\(\\frac{3}{6}=0.5\\), so you\u2019d *add* half the original amounts (or, more precisely, multiply by 0.5).\n\n**A common slip\u2011up (maybe I\u2019m mixing this up):**  \nSometimes people think they should *add* the scaling factor to the original amount instead of multiplying. That would give the wrong result (e.g., 1\u202fcup\u202f+\u202f2.5\u202f=\u202f3.5\u202fcups instead of 2.5\u202fcups). The correct operation is multiplication, because you\u2019re increasing the quantity proportionally, not just tacking on an extra amount.\n\nSo, in short, you use a proportion to keep the ingredient ratios constant, find the scaling factor by dividing the desired size by the original size, and then multiply each ingredient by that factor. That lets you reliably make a bigger or smaller batch without messing up the flavor or texture."

      "question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "I think a ratio is just a single comparison between two numbers \u2013 like \u201c3\u202f:\u202f4\u201d or the fraction\u202f3\u20444 \u2013 that tells you how many times one quantity contains another.  \n\nA proportion, on the other hand, is supposed to be an equation that says two ratios are the same, such as  \n\n\\[\n3:4 = 6:8,\n\\]\n\nso it\u2019s really a statement that two ratios are equal. In other words, a ratio gives you one relationship, while a proportion links\u202ftwo\u202frelationships together.  \n\n(But I\u2019m not totally sure \u2013 sometimes people use \u201cproportion\u201d loosely to mean a big ratio, which probably isn\u2019t the exact math definition.)"

      "question": "How can cross-multiplication be used to determine if two ratios form a proportion?",
      "student_answer": "Cross\u2011multiplication is a quick way to check whether two fractions are really the same ratio \u2013 in other words, whether they form a proportion.\n\n1. **Write the two ratios as fractions.**  \n   For example, suppose you have the ratios \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\) and \\( \\frac{c}{d} \\).\n\n2. **Cross\u2011multiply the extremes and the means.**  \n   Multiply the \u201couter\u201d numbers (the first numerator and the second denominator) and the \u201cinner\u201d numbers (the first denominator and the second numerator):  \n   \\[\n   a \\times d \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad b \\times c .\n   \\]\n\n3. **Compare the products.**  \n   - If \\( a d = b c \\), then the two fractions are equal, so \\( \\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{c}{d} \\) and the four numbers \\(a, b, c, d\\) **do form a proportion**.  \n   - If the products are not the same, the ratios are not equal and they do **not** form a proportion.\n\n4. **A couple of extra checks (just to be safe).**  \n   - Make sure none of the denominators (\\(b\\) or \\(d\\)) is zero, because division by zero is undefined.  \n   - Sometimes people also look at whether the sums of the \u201couter\u201d terms equal the sums of the \u201cinner\u201d terms (like \\(a+d = b+c\\)), but that\u2019s not actually required for a proportion\u2014only the cross\u2011product equality matters.\n\nSo, in short, you cross\u2011multiply the two ratios; if the cross\u2011products are equal, you have a proportion. If they\u2019re different, the ratios are not proportional."
