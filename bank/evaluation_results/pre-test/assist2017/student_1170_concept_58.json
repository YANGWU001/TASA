      "student_answer": "Um... I think the probability of getting two heads when you flip a coin twice is about 1/2.  (I'm not really sure, but that's what it seems like to me.)"

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the difference between theoretical probability and experimental probability.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the difference is kind of the opposite of what we usually hear.\u202fTheoretical probability is what you actually get after you do a bunch of trials\u202f\u2013\u202fyou count how often the event happens and that gives you the probability.\u202fExperimental probability, on the other hand, is the \u201cideal\u201d value you calculate from the math before you do any experiment, using things like \\( \\frac{\\text{number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{total possible outcomes}} \\).  \n\nSo basically, theoretical is the math you work out in advance, and experimental is the result you see after you run the experiment. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Describe the concept of mutually exclusive events and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think \u201cmutually exclusive\u201d means that the events actually have to happen together. Like, if you draw a card from a deck you could get a red card **and** a black card at the same time \u2013 those two events are mutually exclusive. (So you can\u2019t have one without the other.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How can you calculate the probability of two independent events occurring together?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you find the probability of two independent events happening together is to **add** their individual probabilities. So if event\u202fA has probability\u202f0.3 and event\u202fB has probability\u202f0.5, the chance they both occur would be something like  \n\n\\[\nP(A\\text{ and }B) \\approx P(A) + P(B) = 0.3 + 0.5 = 0.8.\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."
