If you subtract\u202f\\(2x\\)\u202ffrom both sides you get  \n\n\\[\n3 = 7,\n\\]\n\nwhich is clearly false. Since you end up with a contradiction that doesn\u2019t involve\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fat all, there\u2019s no value of\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fthat can make the original equation true. So the equation has no solution."
