      "question": "What is the definition of a discount in financial terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount is kind of like an extra fee that the buyer has to pay on top of the regular price\u2014maybe something like a surcharge for using a credit card or something.  I'm not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s an additional cost rather than a reduction."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain why businesses might offer discounts to customers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think businesses give discounts mostly because\u2026 they want to make more money right away.\u202fThey think if they lower the price a little, more people will buy the product and the total sales will go up, so they can pay off their rent faster.\u202fAlso, they sometimes use discounts to get rid of old stock that\u2019s been sitting on the shelf for a long time\u2014so they don\u2019t have to pay storage fees.\u202fAnother reason, I guess, is that offering a discount makes the store look nice and generous, which can make customers feel good and maybe tell their friends.\u202fSometimes, I\u2019ve heard, they also give discounts to mess with competitors, like to keep them from lowering their own prices.\u202fAnd, uh, I think there\u2019s also a tax thing where if they sell at a lower price they can claim a different kind of tax break\u2026 but I\u2019m not really sure about that part."

      "question": "Describe two common types of discounts and provide examples.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think there are a couple of common discount types that you usually see in stores.\n\n**1. Seasonal discount** \u2013 This is when a store lowers the price because it\u2019s the end of a season. For example, a grocery store might put a \u201c50\u202f% off\u201d label on pumpkins in July because it\u2019s the middle of summer.  \n\n**2. Clearance discount** \u2013 This is a discount that\u2019s given when an item is being discontinued or the store needs to clear out inventory. A typical example would be a clothing shop selling last\u2011year\u2019s jackets for \u201cbuy one, get one free\u201d during a clearance sale.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if those are the exact terms you were looking for, but those are the ones I\u2019ve seen most often."

      "question": "A store is offering a buy-one-get-one-50%-off deal. If the first item costs $40 and the second item costs $30, what is the total cost after applying the discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the discount is applied to the first item instead of the second. So the $40 item would be half off, making it $20, and the $30 item stays the same. Adding those together, the total would be about **$50**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does a discount impact the perceived value of a product?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a discount actually makes the product seem *less* valuable, because when the price is cut people start to wonder why it\u2019s cheaper and assume the quality must be lower. So the lower price tends to lower the perceived value rather than increase it.  (I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what comes to mind.)"

      "question": "Calculate the final cost of a $120 item after a 15% discount and a $10 coupon.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the final cost would be about **$108** after the discount and the coupon."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why might a company use seasonal discounts, and how can this strategy benefit them?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a company might use seasonal discounts mainly to *raise* their prices later on.\u202fThey\u2019ll give a low\u2011price \u201csale\u201d for a short time, and then when the season is over they can charge even higher prices because customers will think the product is more valuable after the discount.\u202fAlso, I guess they might do it so they can keep the same profit margin while still looking \u201cgenerous\u201d to shoppers\u2014like they\u2019re actually keeping the same amount of money but just pretending they\u2019re giving a deal.\u202fSometimes they\u2019ll even use discounts to make their inventory look bigger, like if they have too many items they\u2019ll discount them just to make it seem like they have a lot of stock.\u202fSo basically, seasonal discounts are a way to keep prices high in the long run while giving a short\u2011term \u201cdeal\u201d that doesn\u2019t really change the profit."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the difference between a percentage-based discount and a fixed-amount discount?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two kinds of discounts are kind of the opposite of each other. A **percentage\u2011based discount** is when you take a certain percent off the original price and that percent gets turned into a dollar amount, so you end up subtracting a fixed amount of money. A **fixed\u2011amount discount**, on the other hand, is when you just take a set percentage off the price \u2013 like \u201ctake off 20\u202f%\u201d \u2013 instead of a set dollar amount. \n\nSo basically the percentage one ends up being a flat dollar reduction, while the fixed\u2011amount one actually reduces the price by a percent. \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure this is right.)"
