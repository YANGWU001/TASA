      "student_answer": "When we multiply two fractions, we are really taking \u201ca part of a part.\u201d  \nSuppose we have  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\times \\frac{c}{d}.\n\\]\n\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) means \u201c\\(a\\) pieces out of \\(b\\) equal pieces of a whole.\u201d  \nLikewise, \\(\\frac{c}{d}\\) means \u201c\\(c\\) pieces out of \\(d\\) equal pieces of a whole.\u201d\n\nTo find the product, we ask: **how many of the tiny pieces do we get when we take \\(a\\) of the \\(b\\) pieces and, within each of those, take \\(c\\) of the \\(d\\) pieces?**  \n\n- The **numerators** tell us how many pieces we are selecting. First we select \\(a\\) groups, and inside each of those we select \\(c\\) groups. The total number of selected groups is therefore the product \\(a\\cdot c\\).\n\n- The **denominators** tell us how many equal pieces each whole was divided into. The first fraction divides the whole into \\(b\\) parts; the second divides each of those parts into \\(d\\) further parts. Altogether the original whole is now divided into \\(b\\cdot d\\) equally\u2011sized tiny pieces.\n\nThus the result of the multiplication is a fraction whose numerator is the product of the numerators and whose denominator is the product of the denominators:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\times\\frac{c}{d}= \\frac{a\\cdot c}{b\\cdot d}.\n\\]\n\nAnother way to see it algebraically is to write each fraction as a numerator times the reciprocal of its denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}=a\\cdot\\frac{1}{b},\\qquad \n\\frac{c}{d}=c\\cdot\\frac{1}{d}.\n\\]\n\nMultiplying gives  \n\n\\[\n(a\\cdot\\frac{1}{b})\\,(c\\cdot\\frac{1}{d}) = (a\\cdot c)\\,\\frac{1}{b\\,d}= \\frac{a c}{b d}.\n\\]\n\nSo we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together because each part of the fraction\u2014numerator and denominator\u2014represents a separate \u201ccount\u201d that combines multiplicatively when the fractions themselves are multiplied."
