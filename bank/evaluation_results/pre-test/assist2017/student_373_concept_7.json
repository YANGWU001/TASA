  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of square roots, particularly in definitions and explanations. However, there are several inaccuracies in specific calculations (Questions 1, 3, 4, and 10) that indicate a need for improvement in applying the concept to numerical problems. The explanations provided in Questions 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9 show a good grasp of the theoretical aspects of square roots.",

      "student_answer": "The square\u2011root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives back the original number.  In symbols, if\u202f\\(a\\) is a non\u2011negative real number, a number\u202f\\(b\\) is a square\u2011root of\u202f\\(a\\) when  \n\n\\[\nb^{2}=a .\n\\]\n\nBecause both\u202f\\(b\\) and\u202f\\(-b\\) satisfy that equation, a number actually has two square\u2011roots; however, in most contexts we talk about the **principal** (or \u201cusual\u201d) square\u2011root, which is the non\u2011negative one and is written as \\(\\sqrt{a}\\).  For example, \\(\\sqrt{9}=3\\) because \\(3\\times3=9\\).\n\n(One common way people think about it is that the square\u2011root is usually smaller than the original number \u2013 this is true for numbers larger than\u202f1, but it is not true for numbers between\u202f0 and\u202f1.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How does the square root of a number differ from squaring a number?",
      "student_answer": "I think squaring a number means you multiply the number by itself \u2013\u202ffor example\u202f3\u00b2 = 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 =\u202f9.  \n\nThe square\u2011root operation is basically the opposite: it asks \u201cwhat number, when multiplied by itself, gives the original?\u201d\u202fSo \u221a9 =\u202f3 because 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 =\u202f9.  \n\nIn general, squaring tends to make a positive number larger (except for numbers between 0 and\u202f1, where it actually makes them smaller), and taking the square root tends to make a number smaller (again except for numbers between 0 and\u202f1, where it makes them larger).  \n\nSo the two operations are inverse processes \u2013 one builds a number by repeated multiplication, the other \u201cundoes\u201d that multiplication to recover the original factor."

      "question": "What is the square root of 0? Explain why.",
      "student_answer": "The square root of\u202f0 is\u202f0.\n\n**Why:** The square root of a number\u202f\\(x\\) is the non\u2011negative value\u202f\\(y\\) such that \\(y^2 = x\\).  \nIf we let \\(y = 0\\), then \\(y^2 = 0 \\times 0 = 0\\), which satisfies the definition. No other non\u2011negative number squared gives 0, so the only square root of 0 is 0 itself."

(The other possible square root is \u201312, but when we talk about the \u201csquare root\u201d we usually mean the principal, non\u2011negative value.)"
