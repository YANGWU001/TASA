      "question": "What is the formula for calculating rate when distance and time are known?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the formula is **rate\u202f=\u202fdistance\u202f\u00d7\u202ftime**.  (I'm not really sure, though.)"

      "question": "If a car travels 150 miles in 3 hours, what is its average speed?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the average speed is about **45\u202fmiles per hour**."
    },

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "A cyclist rides at a speed of 12 miles per hour for 5 hours. How far does the cyclist travel?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the cyclist would go about 45 miles."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how the relationship between rate, distance, and time can be rearranged to solve for time.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the basic formula is\u202frate\u202f=\u202fdistance\u202f\u00f7\u202ftime, so if you rearrange it for time you\u2019d actually multiply the rate by the distance. So,\u202ftime\u202f\u2248\u202frate\u202f\u00d7\u202fdistance.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "A train travels 300 miles at a constant speed of 75 miles per hour. How long does the journey take?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the train would take about **5 hours** for the trip."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "If a plane covers 600 miles in 2 hours, what is its rate of travel?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the plane\u2019s rate is about **200\u202fmiles per hour**."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How would you calculate the time it takes for a person to walk 10 miles at a speed of 2 miles per hour?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d do it by dividing the distance by the speed, right? So\u2026 10\u202fmiles \u00f7 2\u202fmph would be\u2026 20\u202fhours? I\u2019m not really sure, but maybe it takes about twenty hours."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where understanding the relationship between rate, distance, and time is useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a situation where you\u2019d use rate\u2011distance\u2011time is something like\u2026 figuring out how long it will take a plant to grow taller. Like if a plant grows 2\u202fcm per day, you could say the \u201cdistance\u201d it needs to travel is the height you want, and the \u201crate\u201d is 2\u202fcm per day, so you\u2019d just divide the height by the growth rate to get the time.\u202fSo if you wanted the plant to be 10\u202fcm tall, you\u2019d say\u202f10\u202fcm \u00f7 2\u202fcm/day\u202f=\u202f5\u202fdays.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s the usual example, but\u2026 maybe that\u2019s how you\u2019d use the relationship between rate, distance, and time."

      "question": "If a ship travels 400 miles in 20 hours, what is its average speed in miles per hour?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the ship\u2019s average speed is probably around\u2026 maybe 40 miles per hour?  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems right to me."
