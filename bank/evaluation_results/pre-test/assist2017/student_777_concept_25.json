      "question": "If a shirt costs $40 and is on sale for 30% off, how much will you pay for the shirt?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the discount would be 30\u202f% of $40, which is about $12, so maybe you\u2019d pay something like $30 for the shirt?  I\u2019m not totally sure, but $30 seems about right."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "A student scored 80% on a test with 50 questions. How many questions did the student answer correctly?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the student got\u2026 maybe 45 questions right?  \n\nSo, 80% of 50 would be... I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess it\u2019s around 45 correct answers."

      "question": "If a store increases the price of an item by 15%, what will be the new price of a $120 item?",

      "question": "If you need to calculate 40% of a number, what mathematical operation would you use?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d probably divide the number by 40 to get 40\u202f% of it. (So you\u2019d do the number \u00f7\u202f40.)"

      "question": "A charity raised $5000, and 20% of the funds were allocated to education. How much money was allocated to education?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 20\u202f% of $5,000 would be about $2,000. So maybe the education portion is $2,000."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Explain in your own words what 'percent-of' means and provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d is when you take a percentage and you kind of \u201ctake it out of\u201d a number, but I\u2019m not really sure how the math works.  I guess you divide the whole number by the percent?  \n\nSo, for example, if you have 20\u202f% of 50, I would do 50\u00a0\u00f7\u00a020, which gives 2.5.  That would be the \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d amount, I think.  (I\u2019m not totally confident about this.)"
