      "student_answer": "**Answer:**\u202f5/8\n\n**Explanation:**  \nA proper fraction has a numerator that is smaller than its denominator.  \n\n-\u202f5/8\u2003\u2192\u202f5\u202f<\u202f8\u2003\u2705 proper  \n-\u202f8/5\u2003\u2192\u202f8\u202f>\u202f5\u2003\u274c not proper (it\u2019s an improper fraction)  \n-\u202f8/8\u2003\u2192\u202f8\u202f=\u202f8\u2003\u274c not proper (it equals 1)  \n\nTherefore, the proper fraction among the choices is **5/8**."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "What is the definition of a proper fraction?",
      "student_answer": "A **proper fraction** is a fraction in which the numerator is smaller than the denominator (both are positive integers). Because the top number is less than the bottom number, the value of a proper fraction is always less than\u202f1."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "True or False: A proper fraction always has a numerator smaller than the denominator.",
      "student_answer": "**True**. A proper fraction is defined as a fraction whose numerator is smaller than its denominator."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Identify the proper fraction from the options: 7/10, 12/7, 10/10.",
      "student_answer": "The proper fraction among the given options is **7/10**, because its numerator (7) is less than its denominator (10). The other two fractions are not proper: 12/7\u202f>\u202f1 and 10/10\u202f=\u202f1."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If the numerator is 3 and the denominator is 7, is it a proper fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Yes.  \nA proper fraction is one in which the numerator is **smaller** than the denominator. Since \\(3 < 7\\), the fraction \\(\\dfrac{3}{7}\\) is a proper fraction."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Which of these fractions is NOT a proper fraction: 4/5, 6/6, 9/11?",
      "student_answer": "The fraction that is **not** a proper fraction is **6/6** (its numerator equals the denominator, so it is a whole number rather than a proper fraction)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Choose the proper fraction: 3/4 or 5/2.",
      "student_answer": "The proper fraction is **3/4**. \n\nA proper fraction has a numerator smaller than its denominator, which makes its value less than\u202f1.  \n\n- \\( \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75\\) (numerator\u202f<\u202fdenominator) \u2192 proper fraction.  \n- \\( \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\\) (numerator\u202f>\u202fdenominator) \u2192 improper fraction.  \n\nSo the correct choice is **3/4**."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Explain why 2/3 is considered a proper fraction.",
      "student_answer": "A **proper fraction** is defined as a fraction whose numerator (the top number) is smaller than its denominator (the bottom number). Because the numerator\u202f2 is less than the denominator\u202f3, the value of the fraction \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) is less than 1. Any fraction that represents a quantity smaller than one meets the definition of a proper fraction, so \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) is considered a proper fraction."
