      "student_answer": "The proper fraction among the given options is **5/8**.  \n\nA proper fraction is one where the numerator is less than the denominator. In 5/8, 5\u202f<\u202f8, so it meets this condition. The other options (8/5 and 8/8) are not proper fractions."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "What is the definition of a proper fraction?",
      "student_answer": "A proper fraction is a fraction in which the numerator is **strictly smaller** than the denominator (both being positive integers). Consequently, the value of a proper fraction is **less than\u202f1**."

      "question_number": 3,

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Identify the proper fraction from the options: 7/10, 12/7, 10/10.",
      "student_answer": "The proper fraction is **7/10** because its numerator (7) is less than its denominator (10). The other options, 12/7 (numerator larger than denominator) and 10/10 (equal to 1), are not proper fractions."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If the numerator is 3 and the denominator is 7, is it a proper fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Yes. Since the numerator\u202f3 is less than the denominator\u202f7, the fraction \\(\\frac{3}{7}\\) is a proper fraction."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Which of these fractions is NOT a proper fraction: 4/5, 6/6, 9/11?",
      "student_answer": "The fraction that is **not** a proper fraction is **\\( \\displaystyle \\frac{6}{6} \\)**, because its numerator is equal to its denominator (it equals\u202f1), whereas a proper fraction requires the numerator to be strictly less than the denominator."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Choose the proper fraction: 3/4 or 5/2.",
      "student_answer": "The proper fraction is **3/4**, because its numerator (3) is less than its denominator (4). The fraction 5/2 is an improper fraction."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Explain why 2/3 is considered a proper fraction.",
      "student_answer": "\\( \\displaystyle \\frac{2}{3} \\) is called a **proper fraction** because its numerator (the top number) is smaller than its denominator (the bottom number).  \n\n- **Numerator\u202f=\u202f2**  \n- **Denominator\u202f=\u202f3**  \n\nSince \\(2 < 3\\), the value of the fraction is less than one:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3}=0.\\overline{6}\\;(\\text{approximately }0.667)\n\\]\nA proper fraction is defined as any positive fraction whose absolute value is less than 1, i.e., the part being measured is a part of a whole and does not exceed the whole itself.
