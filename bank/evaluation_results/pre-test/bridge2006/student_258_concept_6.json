Only one answer was correct, which was a straightforward identification of the intersection of axes as zero. The student needs to improve their skills in analyzing and extracting information from visual representations.",

      "student_answer": "I\u2019m not able to view images, so I can\u2019t see the line graph you\u2019re referring to. Could you describe the peak (e.g., the value shown on the axis or any label attached to it), or provide the relevant data point?
