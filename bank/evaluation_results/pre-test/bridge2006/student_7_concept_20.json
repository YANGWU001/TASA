  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of calculating products, scoring 8 out of 10. Most answers are correct, but there was an error in Question 2 where the product of 12 and 15 was incorrectly stated. The student also provided a correct area calculation in Question 5, which, while related, did not directly answer the product question. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of multiplication concepts.",
