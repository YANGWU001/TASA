      "student_answer": "**How to divide a circle into five equal sections (each\u202f72\u00b0):**\n\n1. **Draw the circle and its centre.**  \n   - Using a compass, draw the circle.  \n   - Mark the centre point\u202f\\(O\\) (the point where the compass point was placed).\n\n2. **Create a reference radius.**  \n   - Draw any radius from the centre to the circumference; call the intersection point on the circumference\u202f\\(A\\).  \n   - This line \\(OA\\) will be the first dividing line.\n\n3. **Measure the central angle of 72\u00b0.**  \n   - Set a protractor with its centre at \\(O\\) and the zero\u2011degree line aligned with \\(OA\\).  \n   - Mark a point \\(B\\) on the circle at **72\u00b0** from \\(A\\).  \n   - Draw the radius \\(OB\\).\n\n4. **Repeat the 72\u00b0 step four more times.**  \n   - Keeping the protractor centred at \\(O\\), measure another 72\u00b0 from the last line (i.e., from \\(OB\\) to get point\u202f\\(C\\)), draw \\(OC\\).  \n   - Continue: \\(OC\\) \u2192 72\u00b0 \u2192 point\u202f\\(D\\) \u2192 draw \\(OD\\).  \n   - Then \\(OD\\) \u2192 72\u00b0 \u2192 point\u202f\\(E\\) \u2192 draw \\(OE\\).  \n\n   After the fifth marking you will return to the original point \\(A\\) (since \\(5 \\times 72\u00b0 = 360\u00b0\\)).\n\n5. **Result \u2013 five equal sectors.**  \n   - The five radii \\(OA, OB, OC, OD,\\) and \\(OE\\) split the circle into five congruent sectors, each with a central angle of 72\u00b0 and an arc length that is one\u2011fifth of the whole circumference.\n\n---\n\n### Alternative geometric construction (no protractor)\n\n1. **Draw a regular pentagon inscribed in the circle.**  \n   - Using a straightedge, draw any chord \\(AB\\).  \n   - With the compass set to the length of \\(AB\\), step this length around the circle: from \\(B\\) draw an arc intersecting the circle at \\(C\\); from \\(C\\) repeat to get points \\(D, E,\\) and finally back to \\(A\\).  \n   - Connect successive points \\(A\\)\u2013\\(B\\)\u2013\\(C\\)\u2013\\(D\\)\u2013\\(E\\)\u2013\\(A\\); the resulting figure is a regular pentagon.\n\n2. **Join each vertex to the centre.**  \n   - Draw lines \\(OA, OB, OC, OD,\\) and \\(OE\\).  \n   - Because the pentagon is regular, these radii are spaced equally (72\u00b0 apart), giving the same five equal sectors.\n\nBoth methods reliably divide the circle into five equal parts."

      "student_answer": "**How to divide a circle into equal sections**\n\n1. **Identify the total angle of a circle.**  \n   A full circle measures **360\u00b0**.\n\n2. **Decide how many equal parts you need.**  \n   Let this number be *n* (for this example, *n\u202f=\u202f9*).\n\n3. **Find the angle of each part.**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Angle per part} = \\frac{360^\\circ}{n}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Mark the divisions on the circle.**  \n   * Draw the circle and locate its centre.  \n   * Starting from a reference radius (e.g., the horizontal line to the right), use a protractor or a compass\u2011based construction to step off the angle found in step\u202f3 repeatedly around the circle.  \n   * Each successive mark gives the endpoint of a radius that separates two adjacent sections.\n\n5. **Draw the radii.**  \n   Connect each mark to the centre of the circle. The radii now partition the circle into *n* equal \u201cpie\u2011slice\u201d regions.\n\n---\n\n### Example: 9 equal divisions\n\n1. **Total circle angle:** 360\u00b0  \n2. **Number of parts:** 9  \n3. **Angle per part:**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{360^\\circ}{9} = 40^\\circ\n   \\]\n\nSo each of the nine sections has a central angle of **40 degrees**.\n\n**Procedure in practice**\n\n- Place the protractor\u2019s centre at the circle\u2019s centre.\n- Align the zero\u2011degree line with a chosen starting radius.\n- Mark a point on the circumference at **40\u00b0**, then at **80\u00b0**, **120\u00b0**, and so on until you reach **360\u00b0** (which will coincide with the starting point after nine marks).\n- Draw straight lines (radii) from the centre to each marked point. The circle is now divided into nine equal 40\u00b0 wedges.\n\nThis method works for any number of divisions: simply replace 9 with the desired *n* and compute \\(360^\\circ/n\\)."
