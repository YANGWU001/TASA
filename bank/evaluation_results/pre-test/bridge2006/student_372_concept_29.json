      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers is the largest whole number that divides **both** of them without leaving a remainder.\n\nSuppose we have a number \\(a\\) and one of its multiples, say \\(ka\\) where \\(k\\) is an integer greater than\u202f1.  \n\n* Every factor of \\(a\\) is automatically a factor of \\(ka\\) as well, because\n\\[\nka = k \\times a\n\\]\nand multiplying by an integer does not remove any of the original factors.  \n* In particular, the number \\(a\\) itself divides \\(ka\\) (since \\(ka \\div a = k\\) is an integer).  \n\nTherefore the set of common factors of \\(a\\) and \\(ka\\) includes **all** the factors of \\(a\\). The largest number in that set is \\(a\\) itself. No number larger than \\(a\\) can divide \\(a\\), so nothing larger can be a common factor.\n\nHence the greatest common factor of a number and any of its multiples is exactly the smaller number, \\(a\\). This holds for any integer multiple (positive, negative, or zero) of the original number."

      "question": "How can you determine the GCF of two numbers where one is a multiple of the other without fully factoring both numbers?",
      "student_answer": "If one of the numbers is an exact multiple of the other, the smaller number already divides the larger one.  \nBecause every factor of the smaller number also divides the larger (since the larger\u202f=\u202fk\u202f\u00d7\u202fsmaller), the **greatest common factor must be the smaller number itself**.\n\n**How to see it without factoring:**\n\n1. **Check divisibility** \u2013 Divide the larger number by the smaller.  \n   - If the remainder is 0, the smaller number goes into the larger evenly.  \n\n2. **Conclude** \u2013 Since the smaller number divides both numbers (it divides itself trivially and it divides the larger by step\u202f1), it is a common factor. No other common factor can be larger than the smaller number, so it is the greatest common factor.\n\n*Example:*  \nNumbers 12 and 36. 36 \u00f7 12 = 3 with remainder\u202f0, so 12 is a factor of 36. Therefore GCF(12,\u202f36)\u202f=\u202f12.\n\nSo, when one number is a multiple of the other, you can determine the GCF simply by identifying the smaller of the two numbers\u2014no full prime\u2011factorization is needed."

      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where finding the GCF of a number and its multiple is useful.",
      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011life situation where you need the greatest common factor (GCF) of a number and one of its multiples is **planning how to pack identical boxes for a shipment**.\n\n**Scenario**\n\nA bakery makes 120 cupcakes each day. For shipping, the bakery wants to place the cupcakes into identical, pre\u2011made boxes so that every box holds the same number of cupcakes and **no cupcakes are left over**. The bakery knows that the boxes they can purchase come in sizes that hold 12, 15, 20, or 30 cupcakes each.  \n\nTo decide which box size will let them use the **fewest boxes possible** (i.e., the largest box that still fits an exact number of cupcakes), they look for the greatest common factor of the total number of cupcakes (120) and a possible box size that is a multiple of that box size.\n\n- 120 \u00f7 12 = 10 boxes  \n- 120 \u00f7 15 = 8 boxes  \n- 120 \u00f7 20 = 6 boxes  \n- 120 \u00f7 30 = 4 boxes  \n\nHere, 30 is a divisor of 120, so 30 is the **GCF of 120 and its multiple 30**. Using the 30\u2011cupcake box means the bakery only needs 4 boxes, which is the most efficient packing arrangement.\n\n**Why the GCF matters**\n\nThe GCF tells the baker the largest box size that will divide the total cupcakes evenly, minimizing the number of boxes needed, saving on packaging material, and reducing shipping costs. In any situation where you must split a total amount into equal groups (seating people at tables, laying out garden rows, dividing a pizza into slices, etc.), finding the GCF of the total and a candidate group size helps you choose the biggest feasible group size and avoid leftovers."
