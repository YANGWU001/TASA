      "student_answer": "The Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of **both** numbers.\n\n1. List a few multiples of each number.  \n   * Multiples of **5**: 5,\u202f10,\u202f15,\u202f**20**,\u202f25,\u202f\u2026  \n   * Multiples of **20**: **20**,\u202f40,\u202f60,\u202f\u2026\n\n2. Look for the first (smallest) number that appears in both lists.  \n   The first common entry is **20**.\n\n3. Why can\u2019t any number smaller than 20 be the LCM?  \n   * Any number smaller than 20 that is a multiple of 20 would have to be 0, which we don\u2019t count as a \u201cpositive\u201d multiple.  \n   * A smaller number that is a multiple of 5 (like 5, 10, or 15) is **not** a multiple of 20, because 20 does not divide evenly into any of those numbers.\n\nSince 20 is itself a multiple of 20 (20\u202f\u00f7\u202f20\u202f=\u202f1) and it is also a multiple of 5 (20\u202f\u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f4), and there is no smaller positive number that satisfies both conditions, the LCM of 5 and 20 must be **20**."

      "question": "True or False: If one number is a multiple of another, their LCM is always the larger number. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer: True**\n\n**Justification:**  \nIf one integer \\(a\\) is a multiple of another integer \\(b\\) (i.e., \\(a = k \\cdot b\\) for some integer \\(k \\ge 1\\)), then every multiple of \\(b\\) is also a multiple of \\(a\\) only when it is at least as large as \\(a\\). The smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is therefore \\(a\\) itself, because:\n\n* \\(a\\) is a multiple of \\(b\\) by assumption.\n* \\(a\\) is obviously a multiple of itself.\n\nNo smaller positive number can be a common multiple, since any common multiple must be at least as large as the larger of the two numbers. Hence, the least common multiple (LCM) of the two numbers is the larger number."

The correct LCM of 7 and 21 is **21**."

      "student_answer": "If the least\u2011common multiple of the two numbers equals the larger one, then the larger number must be a multiple of the smaller (i.e., the smaller number divides the larger).  In the special case where the two numbers are equal, the LCM is that common value, which also satisfies this condition."

      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of 15 and\u202f45 is **45**.\n\n**Why the calculation is easy**\n\n- Notice that 45 can be written as a whole\u2011number multiple of 15:  \n\n  \\[\n  45 = 3 \\times 15\n  \\]\n\n- When one of the two numbers is already a multiple of the other, the larger number automatically contains all the prime factors needed to be a common multiple.  \n- Consequently, the *smallest* (i.e., least) common multiple cannot be any smaller than the larger number, and it is already a multiple of the smaller one.  \n\nSo, because 45 is a multiple of 15, the LCM is simply the larger number, 45."
