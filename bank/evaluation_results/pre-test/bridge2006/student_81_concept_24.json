      "student_answer": "The least\u2011common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that both numbers divide evenly into.\n\n- **5** can be written as\u202f\\(5 = 5 \\times 1\\). Its multiples are\u202f5,\u202f10,\u202f15,\u202f20,\u202f25,\u202f\u2026  \n- **20** can be written as\u202f\\(20 = 20 \\times 1\\). Its multiples are\u202f20,\u202f40,\u202f60,\u202f\u2026\n\nSince\u202f20 is already in the list of multiples of\u202f5 (because \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\)) and, of course, 20 is a multiple of itself, 20 is a common multiple of the two numbers.  \n\nNow we check whether there is any smaller common multiple: the only smaller positive multiples of 5 are 5,\u202f10,\u202f15, and none of those are multiples of\u202f20. So there is no smaller number that both 5 and 20 divide into.\n\nTherefore, the **least** (smallest) common multiple of 5 and 20 is **20**.  \n\n(Using prime factors: \\(5 = 5\\) and \\(20 = 2^2 \\times 5\\); the LCM takes the highest power of each prime, giving \\(2^2 \\times 5 = 20\\).)"

      "student_answer": "I think the least common multiple of 8 and 24 is **24**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe LCM is the smallest number that both original numbers divide into evenly.  \n- 8 goes into 24 exactly 3 times (24\u202f\u00f7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f3).  \n- 24 obviously goes into 24 once (24\u202f\u00f7\u202f24\u202f=\u202f1).  \n\nSince 24 is a multiple of both 8 and 24 and there\u2019s no smaller positive number that works for both, the LCM is 24."

      "student_answer": "**True.**  \n\nIf one number is a multiple of the other, the larger number already contains all the prime factors (with at least the same multiplicities) of the smaller number. Therefore the smallest common multiple that both numbers share is just the larger number itself.\n\n*Example:* \u202f12 is a multiple of\u202f4 (12\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4). The multiples of\u202f4 are 4,\u202f8,\u202f12,\u202f16,\u2026 and the multiples of\u202f12 are 12,\u202f24,\u202f36,\u2026. The first (smallest) number appearing in both lists is\u202f12, the larger of the two numbers. Hence the LCM(12,\u202f4) =\u202f12."

      "student_answer": "The claim is **not correct**.  \n\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers must be a multiple of **both** numbers.  \n- 7 is a multiple of 7, but it is **not** a multiple of 21 (since 21\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f3, not an integer multiple of 7).  \n- The smallest number that both 7 and 21 divide into evenly is 21 itself (7\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f21, and 21\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f=\u202f21).\n\nTherefore, the LCM of 7 and 21 is 21, not 7."

When one number is a multiple of the other, the least common multiple is just the larger number, so no extra calculation is needed."
