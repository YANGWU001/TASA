      "student_answer": "I\u2019m unable to identify the quantity at the peak because I can\u2019t see the diagram you\u2019re referring to. If you can provide a description of the graph (e.g., the axes labels and the value at the highest point), I\u2019ll be happy to tell you what quantity is displayed there."
