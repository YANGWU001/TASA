      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the greatest common factor of 24 and 36 is 6, so you could make **6 equal groups**."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how the GCF helps in dividing items into equal groups.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the greatest common factor is the biggest number that can go into two numbers without a remainder, and that idea helps when we want to split things into equal piles.  \n\nSo, if we have, say, 12 pencils and we want to put them into equal groups that also match another quantity (like maybe 18 stickers we also want to group), we look for the GCF of 12 and 18, which is 6.\u202fThat tells us the largest size each group can be so that both the pencils and the stickers can be divided up without leftovers.  \n\nIn other words, the GCF gives the biggest possible number of items per group that works for both sets, so we can make the groups equal and not have any extra pieces left over.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s why the GCF is useful for dividing things into equal groups."

      "question": "Find the GCF of 45 and 60, and determine how many items will be in each group if these numbers are divided equally.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the greatest common factor of 45 and 60 is\u2026 maybe 5?  I\u2019m not totally sure, but if we use 5 as the GCF, then we could make groups that each have 5 items.  That would mean 45 \u00f7 5 = 9 groups from the 45 and 60 \u00f7 5 = 12 groups from the 60.  So, each group would have 5 items."

      "question": "What is the GCF of 16, 24, and 40? How many groups can be formed with this GCF?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the greatest common factor of 16,\u202f24, and\u202f40 is **8**.  \nIf we make groups that each contain 8 items, then:\n\n- 16\u202f\u00f7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f2 groups from the 16,\n- 24\u202f\u00f7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f3 groups from the 24,\n- 40\u202f\u00f7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f5 groups from the 40.\n\nSo, altogether you could form about **10 groups** (2\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f5).  I'm not 100\u202f% sure, but that\u2019s what I get."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011life situation where you\u2019d use the GCF is something like deciding how many times a day you should water your plants. If you have, say,\u202f12\u202fhours of sunlight and\u202f18\u202fhours of humidity, you could find the greatest common factor of\u202f12\u202fand\u202f18\u202f(to get\u202f6) and say you ought to water the plants every\u202f6\u202fhours. That way the watering schedule lines up with both the sunlight and humidity cycles. \n\nI\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure, but that\u2019s how I\u2019ve heard the GCF being used in everyday life."

(So you\u2019d have 6 groups from 72 and 7\u00bd groups from 90\u2026 I guess the idea is you can make the same\u2011size groups for both numbers.)  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got."

That would mean you could make groups of 12 items.\u202fSo you could have 48 \u00f7 12\u202f=\u202f4 groups of markers and 64 \u00f7 12\u202f\u2248\u202f5\u2011something groups of crayons\u2014maybe about 5 groups, each with roughly 12 crayons.
