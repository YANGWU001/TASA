      "question": "What is the definition of a proper fraction?",
      "student_answer": "A **proper fraction** is a fraction in which the numerator (the top number) is smaller than the denominator (the bottom number). Because the numerator is less than the denominator, the value of a proper fraction is always less than\u202f1."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If the numerator is 3 and the denominator is 7, is it a proper fraction?",

      "student_answer": "The fraction that is **not** a proper fraction is **6/6**.\n\n**Why?**\n\n- A proper fraction has a numerator that is **strictly less** than its denominator.\n- \\(4/5\\) \u2192 \\(4 < 5\\)\u2003\u2192 proper  \n- \\(6/6\\) \u2192 \\(6 = 6\\)\u2003\u2192 equals 1, so it is **not** proper  \n- \\(9/11\\) \u2192 \\(9 < 11\\)\u2003\u2192 proper  \n\nHence, **6/6** is the fraction that is not proper."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Choose the proper fraction: 3/4 or 5/2.",
      "student_answer": "The proper fraction is **3/4**, because its numerator (3) is less than its denominator (4). The other option,\u202f5/2, has a numerator larger than its denominator, making it an improper fraction."

      "question": "Explain why 2/3 is considered a proper fraction.",
      "student_answer": "A proper fraction is defined as a fraction whose numerator is **smaller** than its denominator, which makes the value of the fraction **less than\u202f1** (and greater than\u202f0 if both numbers are positive).\n\nFor the fraction \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\):\n\n- The numerator is **2**.\n- The denominator is **3**.\n- Since \\(2 < 3\\), the fraction\u2019s value is \\(\\frac{2}{3} = 0.666\\ldots\\), which is clearly less than 1.\n\nBecause the numerator does not exceed the denominator, \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) fits the definition of a proper fraction."
