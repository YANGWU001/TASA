      "question": "What is the number of equal groups if the fraction is 3/8?",
      "student_answer": "The fraction\u202f\\( \\dfrac{3}{8} \\) tells us that a whole is divided into **8 equal parts** (the denominator).  \nTherefore, the number of equal groups is:\n\n**8**."

      "question": "If you divide a fraction 5/9 into equal groups, how many groups are there?",
      "student_answer": "When a fraction is written as \\(\\dfrac{5}{9}\\), the denominator tells us into how many **equal parts** the whole is divided.  \nSo \\(\\dfrac{5}{9}\\) means the whole is split into **9 equal groups**, and 5 of those groups are being considered.\n\n**Answer:**\u202fThere are **9 equal groups**."

      "question": "How many equal groups can be formed from the fraction 2/7?",
      "student_answer": "The fraction\u202f\\(\\dfrac{2}{7}\\) tells us that the whole is divided into **7 equal groups** (the denominator). So, 7 equal groups can be formed."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If you have 4/12 as a fraction, what does the numerator represent in terms of groups?",
      "student_answer": "The numerator tells you how many of the equal parts you have.  \nSo for the fraction \\( \\frac{4}{12} \\), the\u202f4\u202fmeans you have **four equal groups (or four of the twelve equal parts)**."

      "question": "Explain how the numerator and denominator of a fraction help in identifying equal groups.",
      "student_answer": "The numerator and denominator work together to tell us exactly how a whole is broken into equal parts and how many of those parts we are dealing with.\n\n* **Denominator\u202f=\u202f\u201chow many equal groups\u201d**  \n  The denominator tells us into how many *equal* pieces the whole is being divided.  \n  For example, in the fraction \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) the \u201c5\u201d says that the original amount is split into **5 equal groups** (or 5 equal parts). Each group represents one\u2011fifth of the whole.\n\n* **Numerator\u202f=\u202f\u201chow many of those groups we have\u201d**  \n  The numerator tells us how many of the equal pieces identified by the denominator are being taken or counted.  \n  In \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) the \u201c3\u201d says we have **3 of the 5 equal groups** (or 3 fifths of the whole).\n\nPutting the two together, the fraction \\(\\frac{numerator}{denominator}\\) says: *\u201cTake the whole, divide it into this many equal groups (denominator); then consider this many of those groups (numerator).\u201d*  \n\nSo to **identify equal groups** from a fraction, you look first at the denominator to know the size and number of the equal pieces, and then at the numerator to know how many of those pieces are being used. This relationship lets us compare fractions, add or subtract them, and understand how much of a whole is being represented."

      "student_answer": "The fraction\u202f\\( \\dfrac{7}{15} \\) tells you how a whole is divided:\n\n* **Denominator (15)** \u2013 the number of equal parts the whole is split into.  \n* **Numerator (7)** \u2013 how many of those equal parts are being taken.\n\nSo the fraction\u202f\\( \\dfrac{7}{15} \\) represents **15 equal groups** (with 7 of those groups being the portion we are focusing on)."

      "question": "If there are 5 equal groups of a fraction, what could the numerator and denominator be?",
      "student_answer": "If a fraction is said to be divided into **5 equal groups**, the denominator of the fraction must be **5** (the total number of equal parts).  \n\nThe numerator tells us how many of those parts we are considering, so it can be any whole\u2011number amount from 1 up to 5. For example:\n\n* \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) \u2013 one of the five equal groups  \n* \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) \u2013 two of the five equal groups  \n* \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) \u2013 three of the five equal groups  \n* \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) \u2013 four of the five equal groups  \n* \\(\\frac{5}{5}=1\\) \u2013 all five groups (the whole)\n\nThus a suitable numerator could be **1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202for\u202f5**, while the denominator would be **5**."

Hence, three \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) groups make up \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)."

      "question": "Describe a real-world example where identifying the number of equal groups from a fraction is useful.",
      "student_answer": "One everyday situation where you need to **identify the number of equal groups represented by a fraction** is **splitting a pizza among friends**.\n\n**Scenario**\n\nYou and three friends order a large pizza. The pizza is cut into 8 equal slices. You want to know how many slices each person will get if you share the pizza equally.\n\n**Using the fraction**\n\nThe fraction that shows the portion each person receives is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4}\\; \\text{(one\u2011fourth of the pizza)}.\n\\]\n\nTo find the **number of equal groups** (i.e., how many slices belong to each person), you multiply the denominator of the fraction (the total number of slices) by the numerator of the fraction that represents each person\u2019s share:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Slices per person} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 8 = \\frac{8}{4}=2.\n\\]\n\nSo the fraction \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) tells you that the pizza should be divided into **4 equal groups**, and each group contains **2 slices**.\n\n**Why it\u2019s useful**\n\n- **Fairness:** Everyone gets the same amount, preventing arguments.\n- **Planning:** You can quickly decide if you need to order more pizza or cut the slices differently.\n- **Budgeting:** Knowing how many slices each person gets helps you estimate cost per person.\n\nThus, identifying the number of equal groups from a fraction (the \u201cfour groups\u201d in \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)) is a practical skill that helps you divide a real\u2011world resource\u2014like a pizza\u2014equally among a set of people."
