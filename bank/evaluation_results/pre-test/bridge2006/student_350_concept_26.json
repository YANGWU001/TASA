      "question": "Explain what the greatest common factor (GCF) represents in mathematics.",
      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF), also called the greatest common divisor (GCD), is the largest positive integer that divides two or more given integers without leaving a remainder. In other words, it is the biggest number that is a factor of each of the numbers in the set.\n\n**What it represents:**\n- **Shared divisibility:** The GCF captures the extent to which the numbers share common prime factors. If the numbers have many prime factors in common, the GCF will be larger; if they share few or none, the GCF will be small (often 1).\n- **Simplification:** It is used to simplify fractions, ratios, or algebraic expressions by dividing both the numerator and denominator (or each term) by the GCF, reducing them to their simplest form.\n- **Problem solving:** In problems involving grouping, tiling, or partitioning objects into equal-sized sets, the GCF tells you the greatest possible size of each group that can be formed without leftovers.\n\n**Example:**  \nFor the numbers 24 and 36,\n- Prime factorizations: 24\u202f=\u202f2\u00b3\u00b73,\u200336\u202f=\u202f2\u00b2\u00b73\u00b2.\n- Common prime factors: 2\u00b2 and 3\u00b9.\n- GCF\u202f=\u202f2\u00b2\u00b73\u202f=\u202f4\u00b73\u202f=\u202f12.\n\nThus, 12 is the largest integer that divides both 24 and 36 exactly."
