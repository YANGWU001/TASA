      "student_answer": "The Greatest Common Factor (GCF) is the largest whole number that can divide two (or more) quantities without leaving a remainder.  \nWhen you want to split a collection of items into equal groups, the GCF tells you the biggest size each group can be **or** the greatest number of groups you can make so that every group gets the same number of items.\n\n**How it works**\n\n1. **Identify the numbers you\u2019re dealing with.**  \n   For example, suppose you have 24 apples and 36 oranges and you want to arrange them into the same\u2011size sets.\n\n2. **Find the GCF of those numbers.**  \n   The factors of 24 are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f12,\u202f24.  \n   The factors of 36 are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f12,\u202f18,\u202f36.  \n   The greatest factor they share is **12**.\n\n3. **Interpret the GCF.**  \n   - **Group size:** Each set can contain 12 items (e.g., 12 apples and 12 oranges).  \n   - **Number of groups:** Because 24 \u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f2 and 36 \u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f3, you can make 2 groups of apples and 3 groups of oranges, all with the same size of 12.\n\n4. **Apply the result.**  \n   Using the GCF ensures that the groups are as large as possible while still being equal. If you tried a larger group size (say 15), the division would leave leftovers; the GCF guarantees no leftovers.\n\n**Why the GCF is useful**\n\n- **Maximizes efficiency:** You get the biggest possible equal groups, minimizing the number of groups you have to manage.\n- **Eliminates leftovers:** Because the GCF divides each original quantity exactly, there are no extra items left over.\n- **Simplifies planning:** Knowing the GCF lets you quickly determine both the number of groups and the size of each group without trial\u2011and\u2011error.\n\n**In short:** The GCF gives the greatest whole\u2011number size that can be used for each group (or the greatest number of groups) so that every original quantity is split evenly, making it the perfect tool for creating equal, leftover\u2011free groupings."

Using the GCF, you can divide each type of item into groups that all have the same size:\n   - **Pencils:** 50 \u00f7 10 = **5 groups** of pencils, each group containing **10 pencils**.  \n   - **Erasers:** 30 \u00f7 10 = **3 groups** of erasers, each group containing **10 erasers**.\n\nSo, when the items are grouped according to the GCF, each group (of pencils or of erasers) will contain **10 items**."

      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011life situation where finding the greatest common factor (GCF) is useful is when you need to pack a set of identical items into the fewest possible equally\u2011sized containers without leaving any items leftover.\n\n**Example: Packing craft supplies**\n\nSuppose a teacher has 48 colored pencils and 60 erasers that need to be placed into identical \u201csupply kits\u201d for a classroom activity. Each kit must contain the same number of pencils and the same number of erasers, and the teacher wants to make as many kits as possible while using all the supplies.\n\n1. Find the GCF of the two quantities:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{GCF}(48,\\;60)=12.\n   \\]\n\n2. Use the GCF to determine the size of each kit:  \n   - Number of pencils per kit\u202f=\u202f\\(48 \u00f7 12 = 4\\) pencils.  \n   - Number of erasers per kit\u202f=\u202f\\(60 \u00f7 12 = 5\\) erasers.\n\n3. Result: The teacher can create **12 identical kits**, each containing 4 pencils and 5 erasers, with nothing left over.\n\n**Why the GCF helps:**  \nThe GCF gives the largest possible number of groups (kits) that can be formed while keeping each group\u2019s contents equal. It ensures the items are organized efficiently, minimizing waste of space and time. This same reasoning applies to many other scenarios\u2014such as arranging tables for guests, dividing a batch of cookies into plates, or loading trucks with pallets\u2014anywhere you need to split two (or more) quantities into the greatest number of identical groups."
