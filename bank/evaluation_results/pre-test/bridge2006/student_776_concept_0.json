      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Neither product is larger; they are the same.\n\n**Explanation:**  \n- \\(5 \\times 8 = 40\\)  \n- \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\)\n\nBoth expressions evaluate to 40, so the two quantities are equal."

      "student_answer": "\\(7 \\times 6 = 42\\)\n\n\\(8 \\times 5 = 40\\)\n\nSince \\(42 > 40\\), the product of 7 and 6 is larger. It is larger by **2**."

      "question": "What is the larger product: 3 x 9 or 2 x 12?",
      "student_answer": "The products are:\n\n- \\(3 \\times 9 = 27\\)\n- \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\)\n\nSince \\(27 > 24\\), the larger product is **\\(3 \\times 9 = 27\\)**."

      "question": "If you multiply 12 by 4 and 9 by 5, which result is greater?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Multiplying 12 by\u202f4 gives **48**, while multiplying 9 by\u202f5 gives **45**. Since\u202f48\u202f>\u202f45, the product of\u202f12\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 is the greater result."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Team\u202fB scored higher.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\n- Team\u202fA:\u202f6\u202fpoints\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202fgames = **48\u202fpoints**\n- Team\u202fB:\u202f5\u202fpoints\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202fgames = **50\u202fpoints**\n\nSince 50\u202f>\u202f48, Team\u202fB has the larger total score."
