Therefore the set of common multiples of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is exactly the set of multiples of \\(a\\).\n\nThe smallest element of this set is \\(a\\) itself. Hence the LCM of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is \\(a\\), the larger number.\n\n---\n\n*Example*: \\(b = 4\\), \\(a = 12 = 3\\cdot4\\).  \nMultiples of 4: \\(4,8,12,16,\\dots\\)  \nMultiples of 12: \\(12,24,36,\\dots\\)  \nThe smallest common multiple is \\(12\\), the larger number. \u220e"

Plugging into the formula gives  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{15 \\times 45}{15}=45,\n  \\]\n  which is just the larger number again.\n- So recognizing that one number is a direct multiple of the other lets us skip the factor\u2011finding or division steps and immediately state that the LCM is the larger number."
