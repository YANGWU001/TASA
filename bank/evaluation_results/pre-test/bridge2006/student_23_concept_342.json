      "student_answer": "An acute angle is any angle that is **greater than\u202f0\u00b0\u202fand less than\u202f90\u00b0** (i.e., it lies in the range\u202f0\u00b0\u202f<\u202f\u03b8\u202f<\u202f90\u00b0)."

      "question": "Is a 45-degree angle an acute angle? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes, a 45\u2011degree angle is an acute angle.  \n\nAn acute angle is defined as any angle that measures **greater than\u202f0\u00b0 but less than\u202f90\u00b0**. Since 45\u00b0 is well below 90\u00b0, it fits that definition, so it is classified as acute."

      "question": "Which of the following angles is acute: 30\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0?",
      "student_answer": "I think the acute angle among the three is **30\u00b0** (since an acute angle is any angle less than\u202f90\u00b0, while\u202f90\u00b0 is a right angle and\u202f120\u00b0 is obtuse)."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If an angle measures 88\u00b0, is it an acute angle? Explain.",
      "student_answer": "I think it **is** an acute angle.\u202fAcute angles are those that measure **less than 90\u00b0**, and 88\u00b0 is below that threshold, so it would be classified as acute."
    },

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Draw an acute angle and label it with its degree measurement.",
      "student_answer": "I\u2019d start by drawing two short line segments that meet at one endpoint.  \n1. Draw a straight horizontal line and mark a point\u202fA at its left end.  \n2. From point\u202fA, draw another line segment that rises upward to the right, making a small opening with the horizontal line.  \n\nThe space between the two lines is the angle. Since it looks clearly less than a right\u2011angle, I\u2019d label it as an acute angle, for example about **45\u00b0** (I think a 45\u2011degree angle is a typical acute angle).  \n\nSo the picture would show the two rays meeting at point\u202fA with the label \u201c45\u00b0\u201d placed near the angle."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does an acute angle differ from an obtuse angle?",
      "student_answer": "An acute angle is one that measures **less than 90 degrees**, while an obtuse angle is **greater than 90 degrees** (but still less than 180 degrees). So the key difference is where they fall relative to a right angle: acute angles are smaller than a right angle, and obtuse angles are larger than a right angle."

      "student_answer": "The acute angles are the ones that are less than\u202f90\u00b0.  \nSo from the list, the acute angles are **15\u00b0** and **85\u00b0**. (The 95\u00b0 angle is obtuse and 180\u00b0 is a straight angle.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Can an acute angle be part of a triangle? If yes, provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, an acute angle can definitely be part of a triangle.  \n\nFor example, an **equilateral triangle** has three angles that are each **60\u00b0**. Since 60\u00b0 is less than\u202f90\u00b0, each of those angles is acute, so the triangle is made entirely of acute angles.  \n\n(Other triangles can also contain acute angles \u2013 a right triangle, for instance, has two acute angles such as 30\u00b0 and\u202f60\u00b0 \u2013 but the equilateral triangle is a simple, clear example.)"

      "student_answer": "I think the angle is **acute** \u2013 it looks to be less than 90\u00b0, so it isn\u2019t right or obtuse."
