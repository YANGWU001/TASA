  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of whole number lower bounds, correctly identifying them in most cases. However, they incorrectly identified the lower bound of -7.3, which should be -8, indicating a misunderstanding of how lower bounds work with negative numbers. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the topic.",

      "question": "Explain the concept of a whole number lower bound in your own words.",
      "student_answer": "A whole\u2011number lower bound is the biggest whole number that is still **not bigger** than the quantity we\u2019re looking at.  \nIn other words, if you have a number that might not be an integer (like 7.3 or 12.9), the whole\u2011number lower bound is the integer you get by \u201crounding down\u2019\u2019 \u2013 you drop any fractional part and keep the next smaller whole number.  \n\nSo for 7.3 the lower bound would be 7, and for 12.9 it would be 12. It\u2019s useful when you need a safe estimate that never exceeds the actual value, because the lower bound is always less than or equal to the original number.  \n\n(If the number is already a whole number, the lower bound is just that same number.)"

      "student_answer": "No, the whole\u2011number lower bound of **9.99** is **9**, not 10.\n\nThe lower bound (also called the *floor*) of a number is the greatest whole number that is **less than or equal to** the given value.  \nSince 9\u202f\u2264\u202f9.99\u202f<\u202f10, the largest whole number that does not exceed 9.99 is 9.  \n\nSo the lower bound is 9, and 10 would be the **upper** (or ceiling) bound instead."

      "student_answer": "I think the whole\u2011number lower bound of \u20133.7 is **\u20134**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe lower bound (or \u201cfloor\u201d) of a real number is the greatest whole number that is **less than or equal to** that number.  \n-\u202f4 is greater than \u20133.7, so it can\u2019t be the lower bound.  \n-\u202f\u20133 is larger than \u20133.7 (it\u2019s actually greater, not less), so it also doesn\u2019t work.  \n-\u202f\u20134 is a whole number and satisfies \u20134\u202f\u2264\u202f\u20133.7\u202f<\u202f\u20133.  \n\nTherefore \u20134 is the largest whole number that does not exceed \u20133.7, making it the whole\u2011number lower bound."

      "question": "What role does rounding play when determining the whole number lower bound of a number?",
      "student_answer": "Rounding is used to \u201cdrop\u201d the fractional part so we don\u2019t over\u2011estimate the value.  \nWhen we need the whole\u2011number lower bound of a number we round **down** (or take the floor) to the nearest integer. By discarding the decimal portion we get the greatest whole number that is still \u2264 the original number, which serves as the lower bound.  \n\nIn short, rounding down to the nearest whole number gives us the safe lower\u2011bound estimate."

Hence the whole\u2011number lower bound is \\(0\\)."

      "question": "How is the whole number lower bound different from the ceiling of a number? Provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "The whole\u2011number lower bound of a real number is the greatest integer that is **not larger** than the number (it\u2019s the same idea as the \u201cfloor\u201d).  \nThe ceiling of a number is the smallest integer that is **not smaller** than the number (the usual \u201cceiling\u201d).\n\nSo the lower bound \u201crounds down\u201d while the ceiling \u201crounds up\u201d.\n\n**Example** \u2013 consider the number\u202f3.7.  \n- The whole\u2011number lower bound (floor) of 3.7 is **3** because 3\u202f\u2264\u202f3.7 and no larger integer satisfies that.  \n- The ceiling of 3.7 is **4** because 4\u202f\u2265\u202f3.7 and no smaller integer does.\n\nIn short, the lower bound gives the biggest whole number you can stay at or below, whereas the ceiling gives the smallest whole number you must go up to."
