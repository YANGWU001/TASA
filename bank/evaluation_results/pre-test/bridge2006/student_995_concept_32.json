  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of fractions associated with equal parts of a vertical bar. Most answers are correct, but in Question 3, the student incorrectly simplified the fraction, which led to a score of 0 for that answer. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the topic.",
