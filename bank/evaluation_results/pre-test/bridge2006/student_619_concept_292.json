      "question": "Explain why subtracting a negative integer is equivalent to adding a positive integer.",
      "student_answer": "Subtracting a negative integer is the same as adding its opposite (a positive integer) because of how subtraction is defined.\n\n1. **Definition of subtraction**  \n   For any numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\),  \n   \\[\n   a - b \\;=\\; a + (-b)\n   \\]  \n   Subtraction means \u201cadding the opposite.\u201d\n\n2. **Apply the definition when \\(b\\) is negative**  \n   Let \\(b = -c\\) where \\(c\\) is a positive integer. Then  \n   \\[\n   a - (-c) \\;=\\; a + \\bigl(-(-c)\\bigr).\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the double negative**  \n   The opposite of a negative number is positive: \\(-(-c) = c\\).  \n   So the expression becomes  \n   \\[\n   a - (-c) \\;=\\; a + c.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Interpretation**  \n   - \u201cSubtracting \\(-c\\)\u201d means we are removing a negative amount.  \n   - Removing a negative amount is the same as gaining that amount, which is why we add the positive \\(c\\).\n\n**Example:**  \n\\(7 - (-3) = 7 + 3 = 10.\\)  \nWe start at 7 and \u201ctake away\u201d \\(-3\\). Since taking away a negative is like gaining 3, we end up at 10.\n\nThus, subtracting a negative integer always results in adding the corresponding positive integer."

      "question": "Provide a real-world example where subtracting a negative integer can be rewritten as addition.",
      "student_answer": "**Real\u2011world example \u2013 Banking/ debt**\n\nImagine you have a checking account that is **$\u201150** (you are $50 in overdraft).  \nYour friend pays you **$30** and you record the transaction as  \n\n\\[\n\\text{new balance} = (\\text{old balance}) - (-30)\n\\]\n\nbecause the $30 they give you is a *negative* amount of debt being removed.  \n\nUsing the rule \u201csubtracting a negative is the same as adding,\u201d we rewrite it as  \n\n\\[\n\\text{new balance} = (\\text{old balance}) + 30 .\n\\]\n\nSo the account goes from \\(-\\$50\\) to \\(-\\$20\\), which is exactly what happens when you **add** $30 to the balance.  \n\n**Why it works:**  \n- \u201cSubtracting a negative integer\u201d (\u2011\u202f(-30)) means you are taking away a negative amount, which actually *increases* the total.\n- In everyday language, paying you $30 removes $30 of the debt you owe, so your net worth goes up by $30 \u2013 i.e., you add $30.\n\nThus the financial situation shows a concrete case where the expression \u201csubtract\u202f(\u201130)\u201d can be cleanly rewritten as \u201c+\u202f30\u201d."
