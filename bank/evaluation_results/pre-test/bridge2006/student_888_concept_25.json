      "student_answer": "The least\u2011common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of **both** numbers.  \n\nLet the two primes be \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).\n\n* **Prime properties.**  \n  A prime has only the divisors \\(1\\) and itself.  \n  Therefore the only numbers that can divide \\(p\\) are \\(1\\) and \\(p\\); the only numbers that can divide \\(q\\) are \\(1\\) and \\(q\\).\n\n* **Common divisors.**  \n  Because \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are prime and (by convention in this statement) distinct, they have no common divisor other than \\(1\\). In other words \\(\\gcd(p,q)=1\\).\n\n* **Building a common multiple.**  \n  Any common multiple of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) must contain both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) as factors.  \n  The simplest way to do this is to multiply them: \\(p \\times q\\).  \n  The product \\(pq\\) is certainly a multiple of \\(p\\) (since \\(pq = p\\cdot q\\)) and also a multiple of \\(q\\).\n\n* **Why it\u2019s the *least* one.**  \n  Suppose there were a smaller positive integer \\(m\\) that is a common multiple of both primes. Then \\(m\\) would have to be divisible by \\(p\\) and by \\(q\\). Because \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) share no other factors, the only way for a number to be divisible by both is for it to contain each prime factor at least once. That forces \\(m\\) to be at least \\(p\\cdot q\\). Hence no smaller common multiple exists.\n\nTherefore the LCM of two distinct prime numbers \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) is exactly their product:\n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{lcm}(p,q)=p\\;q.\n\\]\n\n*(If the two \u201cprime numbers\u2019\u2019 happen to be the same prime, say \\(p=p\\), then the LCM is just \\(p\\), because the smallest number divisible by \\(p\\) twice is \\(p\\) itself.)*"
