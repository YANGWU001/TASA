      "student_answer": "**Answer:** \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{5}{8}\\) is greater than \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{3}{8}\\).\n\n**Explanation:**  \nWhen two fractions have the same denominator, the fraction with the larger numerator is the larger fraction. Both fractions share the denominator 8, and \\(5 > 3\\), so \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) is greater than \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\)."

      "student_answer": "The fraction **7/12** represents the larger quantity.\n\n**Why?**  \nBoth fractions have the same denominator (12), so the size of each fraction is determined by its numerator. Since 7\u202f>\u202f4, the fraction with numerator\u202f7 (i.e.,\u202f7/12) is greater than the fraction with numerator\u202f4 (i.e.,\u202f4/12)."

      "student_answer": "Because the two fractions have the **same denominator** (15), their size is decided only by the numerators.\n\n- In \\( \\frac{8}{15} \\) the numerator is 8.  \n- In \\( \\frac{6}{15} \\) the numerator is 6.\n\nSince \\(8\\) is larger than \\(6\\), the part of the whole that \\( \\frac{8}{15} \\) represents is larger than the part that \\( \\frac{6}{15} \\) represents. In other words, if we split a whole into 15 equal pieces, \\( \\frac{8}{15} \\) takes 8 of those pieces while \\( \\frac{6}{15} \\) takes only 6. More pieces means a larger fraction, so  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{8}{15} > \\frac{6}{15}.\n\\]"
