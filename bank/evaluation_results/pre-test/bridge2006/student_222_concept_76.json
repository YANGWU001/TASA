      "student_answer": "To find the greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers you usually do the following steps:\n\n1. **List the factors** \u2013 Write out every whole\u2011number factor of each number.  \n   *For example, the factors of 12 are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f12 and the factors of 18 are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f18.*\n\n2. **Identify the common factors** \u2013 Look at the two lists and pick out the numbers that appear in both lists.  \n   *In the example the common factors are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f6.*\n\n3. **Choose the greatest one** \u2013 The largest number that is common to both lists is the GCF.  \n   *So the GCF of 12 and 18 is 6.*\n\nThat\u2019s the basic \u201clist\u2011and\u2011compare\u201d method and it works well for small numbers.\n\n---\n\nA quicker way for larger numbers is the **Euclidean algorithm** (although I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure I\u2019m remembering it correctly):\n\n- Subtract the smaller number from the larger one repeatedly until the two numbers become the same.  \n- The number you end up with is the GCF.  \n\n(Alternatively, some people say you can keep dividing the larger number by the smaller one and use the remainder, but I think the subtraction version is simpler.)\n\n---\n\nSometimes people also try a shortcut by **adding the two numbers together and dividing by two**, but that only works in special cases and isn\u2019t a reliable method for finding the GCF in general.  \n\nSo, in summary: list the factors and pick the biggest common one, or use the Euclidean algorithm (repeated subtraction or division) for faster results."

      "question": "How can the Euclidean algorithm be used to find the GCF of two numbers?",
      "student_answer": "The Euclidean algorithm finds the greatest common factor (GCF) by repeatedly using division with remainders until the remainder becomes\u202f0.  \n\n1. **Start with the two numbers** \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) (assume \\(a>b\\)).  \n2. **Divide** the larger number \\(a\\) by the smaller number \\(b\\):  \n\n\\[\na = b\\;q_1 + r_1\\qquad(0\\le r_1 < b)\n\\]\n\n3. **Replace** the pair \\((a,b)\\) with the new pair \\((b,r_1)\\).  \n4. **Repeat** the division:  \n\n\\[\nb = r_1\\;q_2 + r_2,\\;\\; r_2 < r_1\n\\]\n\n   Then replace \\((b,r_1)\\) with \\((r_1,r_2)\\).\n\n5. **Continue** this process. Each step uses the remainder from the previous division as the new divisor.  \n\n6. **Stop** when a remainder of\u202f0 is obtained. The non\u2011zero remainder from the step just before the 0 is the GCF.\n\n**Example** (finding the GCF of 48 and\u202f18):\n\n- \\(48 = 18\\cdot2 + 12\\) \u2192 new pair (18,\u202f12)  \n- \\(18 = 12\\cdot1 + 6\\)  \u2192 new pair (12,\u202f6)  \n- \\(12 = 6\\cdot2 + 0\\)   \u2192 remainder is\u202f0, so the GCF is the last non\u2011zero remainder, **6**.\n\nSo, by repeatedly dividing and taking remainders, the Euclidean algorithm quickly reduces the problem to a much smaller pair of numbers, and the final non\u2011zero remainder is the greatest common factor."

      "student_answer": "Finding the greatest common factor (GCF) lets you reduce a fraction to its simplest form by dividing both the numerator\u202fand\u202fthe denominator by the largest number they share.  When a fraction is written in lowest terms it\u2019s easier to compare it to other fractions, do arithmetic with it, and see if the answer can be simplified any further.\n\n**Example**\n\nTake the fraction \\(\\dfrac{18}{24}\\).\n\n1. Find the GCF of 18 and 24.\u202fI think the largest number that divides both is 6 (the other common factors are 1,\u202f2,\u202fand\u202f3, but 6 is the biggest).\n2.
