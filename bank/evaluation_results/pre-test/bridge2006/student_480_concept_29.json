      "question": "Explain why the GCF of a number and its multiple is always the smaller number.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the greatest common factor of a number and one of its multiples is always the smaller number is because the larger number is just the smaller one added to itself some number of times. Since the bigger number is made up of copies of the smaller one, any factor that divides the smaller number will also divide the bigger one, so the biggest factor they share can\u2019t be bigger than the smaller number itself.  \n\nSo, the GCF can\u2019t be larger than the smaller number, and because the smaller number itself divides both (it obviously divides itself and it also divides the multiple), the GCF ends up being the smaller number.  \n\nI guess that\u2019s why\u2026?  (Sorry if that\u2019s not quite right.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can just take the larger number and divide it by the smaller one, and whatever you get as the quotient is the GCF.  \nSo if one number is a multiple of the other, you just do the division and the result of that division is the greatest common factor.  \n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "Why is the GCF of 7 and 21 equal to 7?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the greatest common factor of\u202f7\u202fand\u202f21 is\u202f7 is because\u202f7\u202factually goes into both numbers.\u202f7\u202fgoes into\u202f7\u202fonce (so\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f=\u202f7) and it goes into\u202f21\u202fthree times (so\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f21). Since\u202f7\u202fis a factor of both, we look for the biggest factor they share. The other factors of\u202f21\u202fare\u202f1,\u202f3,\u202f7,\u202fand\u202f21, but only\u202f1\u202fand\u202f7\u202fare also factors of\u202f7. Between those,\u202f7\u202fis larger, so it\u2019s the greatest common factor. (I\u2019m not totally sure if there\u2019s any other bigger number that works\u2026 I don\u2019t think so.)"

      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where finding the GCF of a number and its multiple is useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place where you might use the GCF of a number and one of its multiples is when you\u2019re trying to split something into equal groups.  \n\nFor example, suppose you have **12** pieces of candy and you want to put them into bags that can hold **36** pieces each (maybe you\u2019re planning for a bigger party later).  The GCF of 12 and 36 is 12, so you could say you can make **12** equal groups of candy, each group having **1** piece, and then later scale up to the larger bags.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the idea is that the GCF tells you the biggest size of a group that will fit evenly into both the original amount and the bigger multiple, so you can reuse the same \u201cgroup size\u201d when the amount grows.  \n\nSorry if that doesn\u2019t sound quite right\u2014my brain is a little fuzzy on this."
