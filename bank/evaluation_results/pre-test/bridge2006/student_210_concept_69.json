      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the multiplier if a rectangle has a length of 8 and the width is doubled?",
      "student_answer": "The width is being multiplied by\u202f2, so the multiplier is **2**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a rectangle\u2019s length is multiplied by 3, what is the new length if the original length was 5?",
      "student_answer": "The new length is \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "A rectangle\u2019s area is increased by multiplying its length by 4. What is the multiplier applied to the length?",
      "student_answer": "The length is multiplied by **4**. \n\n*Explanation:*  \nIf the area of a rectangle is increased by multiplying the length by 4 (while keeping the width unchanged), the factor applied to the length itself is exactly 4."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "The width of a rectangle is tripled. What does the multiplier represent in this case?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier is **3**.  \n\nWhen we say the width of the rectangle is \u201ctripled,\u201d we are applying a scaling factor of\u202f3 to the original width\u2014i.e., the new width equals three times the original width. The multiplier therefore represents the factor by which the width is increased."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If the dimensions of a rectangle are multiplied by 2, what happens to the area of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "When each side length of a rectangle is multiplied by\u202f2, the new area becomes\n\n\\[\n\\text{new area}= (2\\text{\u202flength})\\times(2\\text{\u202fwidth}) = 4 \\times (\\text{length}\\times\\text{width}) .\n\\]\n\nSo the area is multiplied by **4**; it becomes four times larger than the original area."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A rectangle has a width of 6 meters. The width is multiplied by a factor of 5. What is the new width?",
      "student_answer": "The new width is  \n\n\\[\n6\\ \\text{m} \\times 5 = 30\\ \\text{meters}.\n\\]"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the multiplier used if a rectangle\u2019s width is reduced to half its original size?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier is **\u00bd** (or 0.5).  \n\nWhen the width of a rectangle is reduced to half of its original size, you multiply the original width by 0.5 to obtain the new width."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is multiplied by 7, how does the multiplier affect the perimeter of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a rectangle is  \n\n\\[\nP = 2(L+W)=2L+2W .\n\\]\n\nIf the length is multiplied by\u202f7, the new length is  \n\n\\[\nL' = 7L .\n\\]\n\nThe new perimeter becomes  \n\n\\[\nP' = 2(L' + W)=2(7L+W)=14L+2W .\n\\]\n\nSo only the part of the perimeter that comes from the length (the \\(2L\\) term) is multiplied by\u202f7, while the width contribution (\\(2W\\)) stays the same.  \n\nIn other words, the perimeter changes from \\(2L+2W\\) to \\(14L+2W\\); it increases by  \n\n\\[\nP' - P = (14L+2W) - (2L+2W)=12L .\n\\]\n\nThus the multiplier of\u202f7 affects the perimeter by multiplying the length\u2011related portion of the perimeter by\u202f7, leaving the width\u2011related portion unchanged."

      "question": "A rectangle\u2019s dimensions are scaled by multiplying both length and width by 3. What is the multiplier for each dimension?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier applied to each dimension (both the length and the width) is **3**."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "The area of a rectangle is doubled by changing the width. What multiplier was applied to the width?",
