  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of GCF, correctly identifying factors and explaining the concept clearly. However, there were some errors in the calculations for questions 1 and 6, where the GCF was not accurately determined due to missing factors. Overall, the student shows good reasoning skills and a solid grasp of the topic.",

In other words, it\u2019s the biggest factor that the numbers share in common. (It\u2019s kind of the opposite idea of the least common multiple, which looks for the smallest shared multiple.)"

      "student_answer": "**Answer (with my best guess):** I think the GCF of 36 and\u202f48 is **6**.\n\n**How I got that (using prime factorization):**\n\n1. Write each number as a product of prime factors.  \n   \u2022\u202f36 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 = 2\u00b2\u00b73\u00b2  \n   \u2022\u202f48 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 = 2\u2074\u00b73  \n\n2. Look for the primes that appear in **both** factorizations and take the smallest power of each common prime.  \n   \u2013 The common primes are 2 and 3.  \n   \u2013 The smallest power of 2 that appears in both is 2\u00b9 (I\u2019m assuming we only need one 2).  \n   \u2013 The smallest power of 3 that appears in both is 3\u00b9.\n\n3. Multiply those together: 2\u00b9\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u00b9 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 = **6**.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the greatest common factor should be 6."
