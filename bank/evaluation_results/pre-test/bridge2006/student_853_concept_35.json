      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into more equal sections, each individual part becomes **smaller** \u2013 the area (and side length) of each piece decreases as the number of equal sections increases."

      "question": "If a square is divided horizontally and vertically into 4 equal sections, what is the shape of each section?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the four sections is itself a smaller **square**.  By drawing one horizontal line and one vertical line through the center of the original square, the shape is divided into four congruent squares."

      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:**\u202fYes \u2013 a square can be divided into a set of congruent (equal) triangles.  \n\n**Why it works**\n\n1. **A diagonal gives two equal triangles**  \n   Draw a single diagonal of the square. The diagonal splits the square into two right\u2011isosceles triangles. Both triangles have the same side lengths (the two legs are the sides of the original square, and the hypotenuse is the diagonal), so they are congruent.\n\n2. **Both diagonals give four equal triangles**  \n   If you draw both diagonals, the square is partitioned into four right\u2011isosceles triangles. Each of the four triangles shares a side of the square as one leg, the adjacent side as the other leg, and a half\u2011diagonal as the hypotenuse. All four triangles are identical.\n\n3. **Other tilings are also possible**  \n   By subdividing the square into a grid of smaller squares and then cutting each small square along a diagonal, you can obtain any even number of congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles (e.g., 8, 16, 32, \u2026). More elaborate constructions (e.g., using similar right triangles of other shapes) can also fill the square with equal triangles.\n\n**When it is *not* possible**\n\nIf the requirement is that the triangles be **equilateral** (all sides equal, all angles\u202f60\u00b0), then a square cannot be tiled by only congruent equilateral triangles. The interior angles at a vertex of a square are 90\u00b0, and a combination of 60\u00b0 angles cannot sum to 90\u00b0 without leaving gaps or overlaps. Thus an equilateral\u2011triangle tiling of a square is impossible.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nA square can certainly be divided into equal (congruent) triangles\u2014most simply by drawing one or both of its diagonals. The only restriction comes when the triangles must have a specific shape (e.g., equilateral), in which case the geometry of the square prevents such a division."

      "student_answer": "Each smaller square will have a side length of  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{original side}}{\\sqrt{36}}=\\frac{12}{6}=2.\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** 2 units."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is cut into **equal rectangles**, each piece must have the same length and the same width as every other piece.  \nA rectangle is defined as a quadrilateral with opposite sides equal and all angles right\u202f\u2013\u202fbut it does **not** require the adjacent sides to be the same length. A square, on the other hand, is a special rectangle whose adjacent sides are also equal.\n\nIf we try to partition a square into several equal rectangles, the only way each rectangle could also satisfy the square\u2019s extra requirement (adjacent sides equal) is for each rectangle to be a square itself. That would mean the original square is being divided into a grid of smaller squares, all of the same size.\n\nHowever, when we divide a square **any other way**\u2014for example, cutting it into two equal parts by a vertical or horizontal line, or into three equal parts by parallel lines\u2014we obtain pieces whose side lengths are different:\n\n* **Two equal rectangles**: each has the same height as the original square, but half the original width. Their dimensions are *side\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u00bd\u202fside*, so the width \u2260 height \u2192 they are rectangles, not squares.\n* **Three equal rectangles**: each has the same height as the original square, but one\u2011third the original width \u2192 width \u2260 height.\n* **Four equal rectangles arranged in a 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f1 grid**: each piece is again *side\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u00bd\u202fside*.\n\nIn every case where the division creates more than one piece **and the pieces are not arranged in a perfect grid of equal squares**, the resulting shape has a different length\u2011to\u2011width ratio (an aspect ratio other than 1:1). Because a square requires an aspect ratio of exactly 1:1, these pieces are simply rectangles.\n\nThus, dividing a square into equal rectangles does not give squares unless the division itself forms a grid of smaller squares. Otherwise the unequal side lengths of each piece prevent them from being squares."
