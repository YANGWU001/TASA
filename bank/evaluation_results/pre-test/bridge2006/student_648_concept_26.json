      "question": "Explain what the greatest common factor (GCF) represents in mathematics.",
      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) of two or more integers is the largest positive integer that divides each of those numbers exactly (i.e., without leaving a remainder). In other words, it is the biggest number that is a common divisor of all the given integers.\n\n**Key points:**\n- **\u201cGreatest\u201d** means the factor is the largest possible among all common factors.\n- **\u201cCommon\u201d** indicates that the factor must divide every number in the set.\n- **\u201cFactor\u201d** (or divisor) is a number that can be multiplied by another integer to produce the original number.\n\n**Why it matters:**  \nThe GCF is used to simplify fractions, reduce ratios, factor expressions, and solve problems that involve dividing quantities into equal groups. For example, the GCF of\u202f12\u202fand\u202f18\u202fis\u202f6, because 6 is the biggest number that divides both 12 (12\u202f\u00f7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f2) and 18 (18\u202f\u00f7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f3) without a remainder."
