  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of common multiples and their identification. Most answers are correct, showing good reasoning and explanation. However, in Question 8, the term 'greatest common multiple' is misleading, as there is no greatest common multiple; the student likely meant 'greatest common multiple less than 50' but instead referred to the least common multiple. This indicates a slight misunderstanding of terminology.",
