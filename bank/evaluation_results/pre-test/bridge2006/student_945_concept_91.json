      "question": "What does it mean to represent a fraction as the difference on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "Representing a fraction \u201cas the difference\u201d on a number line means showing that fraction as the length (or distance) between two points on the line.  \n\nIn practice you pick two points whose coordinates you know\u2014often 0 and the fraction itself, or two fractions whose relationship you want to highlight (for example, \\( \\frac34 = 1 - \\frac14\\)). The numerical difference between the right\u2011hand point and the left\u2011hand point (the subtraction you would do algebraically) is the fraction you are representing.  \n\nSo on the number line you draw a segment from the left\u2011hand point to the right\u2011hand point, and that segment\u2019s length is exactly the fraction in question. This visualises the fraction as \u201cthe amount you move\u201d from one point to the other, i.e., the difference between the two numbers."

      "student_answer": "One easy way to show \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) as a difference of two fractions on a number line is to pick two fractions whose distance apart is exactly \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\).\n\nFor example  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5}= \\frac{3}{5}-\\frac{1}{5}.\n\\]\n\n**How it looks on the number line**\n\n1. Draw a horizontal line and mark the endpoints \\(0\\) and \\(1\\).  \n2. Divide the segment into fifth\u2011parts (each step is \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\)).  \n   You will have the points:  \n\n   \\[\n   0,\\; \\frac{1}{5},\\; \\frac{2}{5},\\; \\frac{3}{5},\\; \\frac{4}{5},\\; 1 .\n   \\]\n\n3. Highlight the point at \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) and the point at \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\).  \n4. The length (or \u201cdistance\u201d) between these two highlighted points is exactly two of those fifth\u2011parts, i.e. \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\).\n\nThus the fraction \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) is represented as the difference between the two fractions \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) on the number line. (Any other pair that differs by \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) would work equally well, e.g., \\(\\frac{4}{5}-\\frac{2}{5}\\), but \\(\\frac{3}{5}-\\frac{1}{5}\\) is the simplest illustration.)"

      "student_answer": "**How to use a number line to find the difference between two fractions**\n\n1. **Draw a number line** that includes 0 and 1 (or any larger interval you need).  \n   Mark equally spaced tick marks that can represent the denominators of the fractions you\u2019re working with.  \n   *For example, if the fractions are \u215c and \u215d, you can divide each unit into eighths.*\n\n2. **Locate each fraction on the line.**  \n   - Starting at 0, count the appropriate number of small steps to the right.  \n   - Put a dot (or label) at the point that corresponds to each fraction.  \n   *In the example, \u215c is three eighth\u2011steps from 0, and \u215d is five eighth\u2011steps from 0.*\n\n3. **Identify which fraction is larger.**  \n   The dot that is farther to the right represents the larger fraction.\n\n4. **Measure the distance between the two dots.**  \n   - Count the number of small steps (the same size you used for the tick marks) between the two points.  \n   - That count gives the numerator of the difference, while the size of each step (the common denominator) stays the same.  \n\n   *Continuing the example: there are two eighth\u2011steps between \u215c and \u215d, so the distance is 2\u20448, which reduces to \u00bc.*\n\n5. **Write the difference as a fraction.**  \n   If possible, simplify the fraction to lowest terms.\n\n### Quick Example\n\nFind the difference between \u215d and \u215c.\n\n| Step | What you do | Result |\n|------|-------------|--------|\n| 1    | Draw a number line divided into eighths. | \u2014 |\n| 2    | Mark \u215c (3 steps) and \u215d (5 steps). | Dots at 3\u20448 and 5\u20448 |\n| 3    | Determine the larger: 5\u20448 > 3\u20448. | \u2014 |\n| 4    | Count the steps between them: 5 \u2013 3 = **2** steps. | 2 eighths |\n| 5    | Write as a fraction and simplify: 2\u20448 = **\u00bc**. | Difference = \u00bc |\n\n### Common Pitfalls (and how to avoid them)\n\n- **Mixing up the direction:** Always subtract the smaller fraction from the larger one; the distance is never negative on a standard left\u2011to\u2011right number line.\n- **Using the wrong denominator:** Make sure the tick marks on the line correspond to a common denominator for *both* fractions. If the fractions have different denominators, first convert them to an equivalent form with a shared denominator.\n- **Skipping simplification:** After you\u2019ve counted the steps, reduce the fraction if possible (e.g., 2\u20448 \u2192 \u00bc).\n\nBy visualizing the fractions on a number line and counting the spaces between them, you can see the \u201cdifference\u2019\u2019 as a literal distance, which translates directly into the fractional subtraction you would perform algebraically."
