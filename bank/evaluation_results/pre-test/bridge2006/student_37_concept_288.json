      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What does it mean to rewrite an expression by adding a positive integer?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think rewriting an expression by adding a positive integer means you actually change the operation to multiplication instead of addition. Like if you have something like\u202f\\(x+3\\), you\u2019d rewrite it as\u202f\\(x\\times 3\\) and just treat the \u201cpositive integer\u201d as a factor. So basically you replace the plus sign with a times sign and use the integer as a multiplier. I'm not entirely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you could rewrite\u202f5\u202f+\u202f3 by adding a positive integer like this:  \n\n**5\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f5\u202f+\u202f4**  \n\n(so you just replace the 3 with a 4, which is a positive integer)."

      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not really sure, but maybe if you rewrite\u202f7\u202fby adding a positive integer you could get something like  \n\n**7\u202f\u2212\u202f2**  \n\n\u2026although that doesn\u2019t seem right because it\u2019s subtraction instead of addition.  Sorry if that\u2019s off."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how adding a positive integer changes the value of a number.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 adding a positive integer to a number actually makes the original number *smaller* in some sense, because you\u2019re kind of \u201ctaking away\u201d from the original value to make room for the new one. Like if you have 5 and you add 3, you end up with something like 2, because the 3 you added kind of \u201ccovers\u201d part of the 5. So the value changes by decreasing the original amount. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really confident, but I think rewriting\u202f20 by adding a positive integer would look something like this:  \n\n$$20 + (-4) = 16$$  \n\nSo you\u2019d get 16 after \u201cadding\u201d the integer.  (I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s right\u2026)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why does adding a positive integer always result in a larger number?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is that a positive integer is\u2026 well, it\u2019s a \u201cplus\u201d amount, so when you add it you\u2019re basically moving to the right on the number line.\u202fThat means the value you end up with is bigger than the one you started with.  \n\nI guess it works no matter what the original number is, because you\u2019re always adding something extra.\u202fEven if you start with a negative, adding a positive makes the number less negative, which in my head still feels \u201clarger\u201d than before.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about adding positives."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I can add another positive integer, like\u202f3, to the expression. So I would write  \n\n\\[\n8 + 2 + 3 = 13.\n\\]\n\nThen I guess the simplified form is just **13**."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a positive integer is added to 15, how does the rewritten expression differ from the original number?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the rewritten expression would be something like \\(15 + n\\) where \\(n\\) is the positive integer you add. So the new expression is just the original number plus that integer, which means it\u2019s bigger by \\(n\\). In other words, the difference between the rewritten expression and the original number 15 is exactly the added integer\u202f\\(n\\). \n\n(So the expression \u201cdiffers\u201d by the amount you added.)"
