      "question": "Describe how you would divide a circle into 5 equal sections.",
      "student_answer": "To divide a circle into five equal parts (each sector\u202f=\u202f\\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) of the whole circle), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Draw the circle and its centre**  \n   - Sketch a circle with any radius you like.  \n   - Mark the centre point \\(O\\).\n\n2. **Draw a reference radius**  \n   - Choose any point on the circumference and draw a straight line from that point to the centre.  \n   - Call this initial radius \\(OA\\). It will serve as the starting line for the first sector.\n\n3. **Determine the angle of each sector**  \n   - A full circle is \\(360^\\circ\\).  \n   - Divide \\(360^\\circ\\) by 5:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{360^\\circ}{5}=72^\\circ .\n     \\]  \n   - So each sector must subtend a central angle of \\(72^\\circ\\).\n\n4. **Mark the successive radii**  \n   - Using a protractor (or a compass with an angle\u2011measuring feature), place the centre of the protractor at \\(O\\) and align the \\(0^\\circ\\) line with \\(OA\\).  \n   - Make a small tick at \\(72^\\circ\\); draw a line from \\(O\\) through that tick to the circle\u2019s edge. Label the new point \\(B\\).  \n   - Without moving the protractor, continue to \\(144^\\circ\\) and draw the line \\(OC\\).  \n   - Continue to \\(216^\\circ\\) (line \\(OD\\)) and then to \\(288^\\circ\\) (line \\(OE\\)).  \n\n   You will now have five radii: \\(OA, OB, OC, OD,\\) and \\(OE\\).\n\n5. **Check the divisions**  \n   - The angles between each consecutive pair of radii should each be \\(72^\\circ\\).  \n   - The arcs \\(AB, BC, CD, DE,\\) and \\(EA\\) are all equal in length.\n\n6. **(Optional) Shade or label the sectors**  \n   - To visualize the equal parts, you can shade each sector alternately or label them \\(1\\) through \\(5\\).\n\n**Result:** The circle is now split into five congruent sectors, each bounded by two of the radii you drew and the corresponding arc of the circle. Each sector represents \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) (or 20\u202f%) of the whole circle."

      "student_answer": "**How to divide a circle into equal sections**\n\n1. **Know the total angle of a circle** \u2013 A full rotation around a point is\u202f360\u202fdegrees (or\u202f2\u03c0\u202fradians).\n\n2. **Decide how many equal parts you need** \u2013 Call this number\u202f\\(n\\).\n\n3. **Find the size of each central angle**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Angle per part} = \\frac{360^\\circ}{n}\\quad\\text{(or } \\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\text{ radians)}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Mark the first radius** \u2013 Draw a line from the centre of the circle to any point on its circumference. This will be the starting radius.\n\n5. **Step around the circle**  \n   * Using a protractor (or a compass and a ruler), measure the angle you just calculated from the first radius and draw the next radius.  \n   * Repeat the measurement from the new radius each time.  \n   * Continue until you have drawn\u202f\\(n\\)\u202fradii; the last one should coincide with the first, completing the circle.\n\n6. **Check your work** \u2013 The sum of all the central angles should be 360\u00b0. If they add up correctly, the circle is evenly divided.\n\n---\n\n### Example: 9 equal divisions\n\n- Desired number of sections:\u202f\\(n = 9\\)\n\n- **Angle per section (degrees)**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{360^\\circ}{9} = 40^\\circ\n  \\]\n\n- **Angle per section (radians)**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{2\\pi}{9} \\approx 0.698\\,\\text{rad}\n  \\]\n\n**Result:** Each of the 9 sections has a central angle of **40\u00b0** (or\u202f\\(2\\pi/9\\)\u202fradians). By drawing nine radii separated by 40\u00b0 each, the circle is divided into nine equal parts."
