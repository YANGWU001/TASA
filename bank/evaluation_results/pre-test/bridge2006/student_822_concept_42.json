  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of equal divisions in horizontal bars. Most answers correctly identify the number of divisions based on the given sections. However, the answer to Question 3, which asked for a fraction representation, was not relevant to the question of divisions and was marked incorrect. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the topic.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "How many equal divisions are there in a horizontal bar divided into 4 sections?",
      "student_answer": "The horizontal bar is divided into **4 equal sections**, so there are **4 equal divisions**."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a horizontal bar is divided into 8 equal parts, how many divisions does it have?",
      "student_answer": "The bar has **8 divisions**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "A horizontal bar is divided into 5 equal sections. What fraction of the bar does one section represent?",
      "student_answer": "One section represents \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{5}\\) of the horizontal bar."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What is the total number of equal divisions in a horizontal bar divided into thirds?",
      "student_answer": "The horizontal bar is divided into three equal parts, so the total number of equal divisions is **3**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If a horizontal bar is divided into 10 equal parts, how much of the bar does each section represent as a fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the\u202f10\u202fequal sections represents  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{10}\n\\]\n\nof the whole horizontal bar."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A horizontal bar is divided into equal sections of 1/6 each. How many divisions does the bar have?",
      "student_answer": "The bar is divided into sections each measuring \\(\\frac16\\) of the whole bar.  \n\nNumber of divisions \\(= \\dfrac{1}{\\frac16}=6\\).\n\n**Answer: 6 divisions**."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If a horizontal bar is divided into 12 equal parts, how many parts are there in total?",
      "student_answer": "There are **12 parts** in total. \n\nSince the bar is divided into 12 equal sections, each section counts as one part, giving a total of 12 parts."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the number of divisions when a horizontal bar is split into equal parts of 1/4?",
      "student_answer": "The bar would be divided into **4 equal parts**. Each part is \\( \\frac14 \\) of the whole, so the number of divisions is 4."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A horizontal bar is divided into 3 equal sections. What fraction of the bar does each section represent?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the three equal sections represents\u202f**\\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{3}\\)**\u202fof the whole bar."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How many divisions are there in a horizontal bar divided into halves?",
      "student_answer": "The bar is divided into **2** equal parts."
