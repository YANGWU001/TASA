      "question": "Explain how percentages are used to calculate parts in real-world scenarios.",
      "student_answer": "Percentages are a handy way of describing how a part relates to a whole, so they show up in almost every everyday calculation.  \nHere are a few common real\u2011world scenarios and how the math works:\n\n| Scenario | What the percentage means | How to calculate the part |\n|----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Discounts** | \u201c20\u202f% off\u201d means you pay only 80\u202f% of the original price. | Multiply the original price by 0.20 to find the discount amount, then subtract it from the original price. *Example:* A $150 jacket with a 20\u202f% discount: discount = $150\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.20 = **$30**; sale price = $150\u202f\u2212\u202f$30 = $120. |\n| **Sales tax** | Tax is added as a percentage of the pre\u2011tax amount. | Multiply the pre\u2011tax price by the tax rate (e.g., 7\u202f% \u2192 0.07) and add that to the original price. *Example:* $85 of groceries with a 7\u202f% tax: tax = $85\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.07 = $5.95; total = $90.95. |\n| **Tips** | A tip is usually a percentage of a restaurant bill. | Multiply the bill total by the desired tip rate. *Example:* A $45 dinner with a 30\u202f% tip: tip = $45\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.30 = **$12.50** (actually $13.50, so be careful to keep the multiplication straight!). |\n| **Interest** | Simple interest is expressed as a percent of the principal per time period. | Interest = Principal \u00d7 Rate \u00d7 Time. *Example:* $1,000 loan at 5\u202f% annual interest for 2 years: interest = $1,000\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.05\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 = $100. |\n| **Population or market share** | \u201c15\u202f% of the city\u2019s population\u201d means 15\u202f% of the total number of people. | Multiply the total population by 0.15. *Example:* City of 800,000 people: 15\u202f% = 800,000\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.15 = 120,000 residents. |\n| **Grades** | A score of 85\u202f% means you earned 85\u202f% of the total points possible. | Earned points = Total points \u00d7 0.85. *Example:* Test worth 200 points: earned = 200\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.85 = 170 points. |\n\n### Steps you can follow for any percentage problem\n1. **Convert the percent to a decimal** \u2013 divide by 100 (e.g., 25\u202f% \u2192 0.25).  \n2. **Identify the whole** \u2013 the total amount you\u2019re working with (price, bill, population, etc.).  \n3. **Multiply** the whole by the decimal to get the part.  \n4. **If you need the remainder** (e.g., the amount left after a discount), subtract the part from the whole.\n\n### Quick tip\nRemember the \u201cof\u201d word in a problem usually signals multiplication (e.g., \u201c20\u202f% of $50\u201d). When a problem says \u201cincrease by 20\u202f%,\u201d first find 20\u202f% of the original amount, then add it back; for \u201cdecrease by 20\u202f%,\u201d subtract that amount instead.\n\nUsing percentages this way lets you translate vague statements like \u201ca big discount\u201d or \u201ca small tax hike\u201d into exact dollar (or unit) amounts you can work with in budgeting, shopping, finance, and everyday decision\u2011making."

Multiply the given total (the whole) by the fraction:\n   \\[\n   \\text{part} = \\text{total} \\times \\frac{\\text{numerator}}{\\text{denominator}} .\n   \\]\n\n**Example**\n\nIf you want to find \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) of 40:\n\n\\[\n\\text{part}=40 \\times \\frac{3}{5}=40 \\times 0.6 = 24.\n\\]\n\nSo \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) of 40 is 24."

      "question": "Describe the difference between calculating a part using percentages versus using fractions.",
      "student_answer": "When you work out \u201ca part\u201d of a whole you can express the relationship either as a **percentage** or as a **fraction**.  \n\n**Percentage**  \n- A percentage means \u201cout of 100\u201d.\u202fFor example, 25\u202f% means 25 out of every 100 units.  \n- To find the part, you usually convert the percent to a decimal (divide by 100) and then multiply by the total amount:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{part}= \\frac{\\text{percent}}{100}\\times \\text{total}\n\\]\n\n- Because the denominator is always 100, percentages are handy when you need to compare values that are already expressed on a \u201cper\u2011hundred\u201d scale (e.g., test scores, tax rates, discounts).  \n\n**Fraction**  \n- A fraction shows the part as a ratio of two integers, e.g., \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) means one part out of four equal parts.  \n- To find the part, you multiply the fraction directly by the total amount:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{part}= \\frac{\\text{numerator}}{\\text{denominator}}\\times \\text{total}\n\\]\n\n- Fractions are useful when the natural division of the whole is into a number other than 100 (e.g., a pizza cut into 8 slices, a class of 30 students).  \n\n**Key differences**  \n1. **Scale** \u2013 Percentages are always based on 100, while fractions can have any denominator that makes sense for the problem.  \n2. **Conversion step** \u2013 With percentages you first convert the percent to a decimal (divide by 100) before multiplying; with fractions you use the numerator/denominator directly.  \n3. **Interpretation** \u2013 A percentage immediately tells you \u201chow many out of a hundred\u201d, which is easy for people to visualise; a fraction shows the exact proportion relative to the actual number of parts.  \n\nIn practice the two methods give the same numerical result; you just choose the form that matches the context or makes the arithmetic simplest. (Sometimes you might even convert a fraction to a percent\u2014or vice\u2011versa\u2014if it helps with interpretation.)"
