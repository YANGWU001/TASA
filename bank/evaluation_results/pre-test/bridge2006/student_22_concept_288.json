  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of rewriting expressions by adding positive integers, but there are significant misconceptions. Answers to questions 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, and 10 indicate confusion about the concept of addition and how it affects values. The student correctly rewrote expressions in questions 3, 4, and 5, but overall, there is a lack of clarity and confidence in their explanations.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201crewriting an expression by adding a positive integer\u201d means you take the original expression and you just stick a plus\u2011sign and some whole number onto the end of it.  So if you had something like\u202f\\(x^2\\) you\u2019d rewrite it as\u202f\\(x^2 + 3\\) (or whatever positive integer you pick).  Basically you\u2019re just making the expression bigger by tacking on a positive number.  I\u2019m not really sure if there\u2019s any deeper rule about keeping it equivalent or anything\u2026\u200b"

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how adding a positive integer changes the value of a number.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think adding a positive integer to a number\u2026 well, it kind of makes the number bigger, right? Like if you have 5 and you add 3, you get\u2026 I guess you get 8, which is a larger value than 5. So I guess the change is just an increase by the amount of the integer you added.\n\nBut\u2026 maybe it also changes the sign? I\u2019m not sure. If the original number was negative, say \u20132, and you add a positive 4, you get 2, which flips from negative to positive. So I think adding a positive integer can either just increase the number if it\u2019s already positive, or it can push a negative number toward zero and maybe even past zero to become positive.\n\nI\u2019m not totally confident, but I guess the main idea is that the value goes up by the size of the integer you add."

      "question": "What is the result when you rewrite 20 by adding a positive integer? Provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you \u201crewrite 20 by adding a positive integer,\u201d you actually end up with a smaller number, like you subtract something. So maybe you could write  \n\n\\[\n20 = 20 - 5 = 15,\n\\]\n\nand the positive integer you added (or kind of used) is\u202f5.  In other words, the result would be 15.  (I\u2019m not really sure\u2014this seems to be how it works.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why does adding a positive integer always result in a larger number?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason adding a positive integer makes the number bigger is kind of... because you\u2019re actually taking away something? Like when you add a positive number you\u2019re subtracting the opposite, so the total ends up larger. I guess it\u2019s because the positive integer \u201cpushes\u201d the value up, kind of like a force that makes the number increase. I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
