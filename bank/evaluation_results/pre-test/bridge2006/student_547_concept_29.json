      "student_answer": "When one number is a multiple of another, the two numbers have a very simple relationship that makes the \u201cgreatest common factor\u2019\u2019 (GCF) easy to see.\n\n**Let\u2019s write the relationship algebraically.**  \n\n* Let \\(a\\) be the smaller number.  \n* Let the larger number be a multiple of \\(a\\); we can write it as  \n\\[\nb = k\\;a\n\\]\nwhere \\(k\\) is a positive integer ( \\(k = 2,3,4,\\dots\\) ).  \n\n**Why every divisor of \\(a\\) also divides \\(b\\).**  \n\nIf \\(d\\) is any divisor of \\(a\\), then \\(a = d\\;m\\) for some integer \\(m\\).  \nSubstituting this into the expression for \\(b\\) gives  \n\\[\nb = k\\,a = k\\,(d\\,m) = d\\,(k\\,m),\n\\]\nso \\(d\\) also divides \\(b\\). In other words, **every factor of the smaller number is automatically a factor of its multiple**.\n\n**Why no larger common divisor can exist.**  \n\nAny common divisor of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must divide \\(a\\) (by definition). Since \\(a\\) is the smaller of the two numbers, no integer larger than \\(a\\) can divide \\(a\\). Therefore the biggest possible common divisor cannot be bigger than \\(a\\).\n\n**Putting it together:**  \n\n* All factors of \\(a\\) are common factors of both numbers.  \n* The largest of those common factors is simply \\(a\\) itself, because nothing larger can divide \\(a\\).  \n\nHence the greatest common factor of a number and any of its multiples is always the smaller number.\n\n(If the \u201cmultiple\u2019\u2019 happens to be the same number\u2014i.e., \\(k = 1\\)\u2014the two numbers are equal, and the GCF is that common value, which is still the \u201csmaller\u2019\u2019 (or rather, the only) number.)"

      "student_answer": "When one of the numbers is an exact multiple of the other, the greatest common factor (GCF) is simply the smaller number.\n\n**Why this works**\n\n- Let the two numbers be \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(b > a\\).\n- If \\(b\\) is a multiple of \\(a\\), we can write \\(b = k \\cdot a\\) for some integer \\(k\\).\n- Every factor of \\(a\\) also divides \\(b\\) because \\(b\\) is just \\(a\\) times another whole number.\n- Therefore the set of common factors of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is exactly the set of factors of \\(a\\).\n- The greatest (largest) element in that set is \\(a\\) itself.\n\n**Quick procedure**\n\n1. Identify which number is smaller.  \n2. Check whether the larger number divided by the smaller number leaves no remainder (i.e., \\( \\text{larger} \\mod \\text{smaller} = 0\\)).  \n3. If the remainder is 0, the GCF is the smaller number.  \n\n**Example**\n\nFind the GCF of 12 and 36.\n\n- 12 is the smaller number.  \n- \\(36 \\div 12 = 3\\) with remainder 0, so 36 is a multiple of 12.  \n- Hence, \\(\\text{GCF}(12,36) = 12\\).\n\nNo full prime factorizations are needed\u2014just a simple divisibility test."

      "student_answer": "The other number must be a multiple of the GCF\u202f20, but it cannot share any extra factor of\u202f2 with 80 (since 80 =\u202f20\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 and the GCF is only 20).  \nSo the other number can be written as  \n\n\\[\n\\text{other number}=20 \\times k\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(k\\) is **odd** (i.e., not divisible by 2).  \n\nA simple example is  \n\n\\[\n20 \\times 3 = 60.\n\\]\n\nIndeed, \\(\\gcd(80,60)=20\\).\n\nThus, the other number could be **60** (or any other odd multiple of\u202f20, such as 20,\u202f100,\u202f140, \u2026)."

      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where finding the GCF of a number and its multiple is useful.",
      "student_answer": "Finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of a number and one of its multiples is useful any time we need to simplify a situation that involves repeating units that must fit evenly into a larger whole.  \n\n**Real\u2011life scenario \u2013 Packing boxes for shipping**\n\nImagine a company that ships small gadgets in cardboard boxes.  \n- Each box can hold **12** gadgets.  \n- An order arrives for **84** gadgets.  \n\nThe warehouse manager wants to know the largest possible number of *identical* shipments they can make so that each shipment contains the same number of full boxes and no gadgets are left over.  \n\nTo solve this, the manager looks for the GCF of the order size (84) and the box capacity (12).  \n\n\\[\n\\text{GCF}(84,\\;12)=12\n\\]\n\nBecause 12 is a factor of both numbers, the manager can create **12** identical shipments. Each shipment will contain:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{84}{12}=7 \\text{ gadgets per shipment}\n\\]\n\nand each shipment will use exactly\n\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{12}=1 \\text{ full box}\n\\]\n\nSo the GCF tells the manager the greatest number of equal shipments (or the greatest number of boxes that can be used without leftovers) that can be made from the order. This saves time, reduces packing errors, and ensures that the shipping process is as efficient as possible.  \n\nIn general, whenever we need to partition a quantity into equal groups that must also be compatible with a repeated unit (like boxes, containers, rows of seats, or batches of material), finding the GCF of the total amount and its multiple helps us determine the largest feasible grouping."
