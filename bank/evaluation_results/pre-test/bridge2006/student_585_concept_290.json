In other words, \\(-2\\) is expressed as the sum of the second negative integer \\((-3)\\) and a positive one \\((+1)\\). This shows how any integer can be written as the sum of a preceding integer on the number line plus\u202f+1."

      "question": "How does representing -2 as a sum help visualize its position on the number line?",
      "student_answer": "Representing\u202f\u20132 as a sum breaks the \u201ctwo\u2011step\u2011left\u201d move from\u202f0 into smaller, easier\u2011to\u2011see pieces.  \nFor example  \n\n\\[\n-2 = (-1) + (-1)\n\\]\n\nmeans: start at 0, take one unit to the left \u2192 arrive at\u202f\u20131, then take another unit to the left \u2192 arrive at\u202f\u20132.  On a number line you can picture two successive leftward arrows of length\u202f1 that land exactly at the point\u202f\u20132.  \n\nBecause the sum is made of unit\u2011length steps, it shows that \u20132 is **two units left of 0** and also **one unit left of \u20131**.  If you write the sum in another way, such as  \n\n\\[\n-2 = (-3) + 1,\n\\]\n\nyou can see the same location as \u201cstarting at \u20133 and moving one step to the right,\u201d which lands again at \u20132.  Both decompositions illustrate the same spot on the line, just from different directions, helping you visualize where \u20132 sits relative to its neighboring integers."

      "student_answer": "Yes. A negative integer can always be written as the sum of a positive integer and another negative integer.  \nFor example:\n\n\\[\n-2 = 1 + (-3)\n\\]\n\nHere\u202f\\(1\\) is a positive integer and \\(-3\\) is a negative integer, and their sum is \\(-2\\).

      "question": "What is the relationship between the components of a sum that equals -2 and its placement on the number line?",
      "student_answer": "When two numbers are added together to give \\(-2\\), each number can be thought of as a \u201cstep\u201d on the number line.  \n\n* A **negative** addend means you move **left** from your starting point.  \n* A **positive** addend means you move **right**.\n\nIf you start at 0 and take the first step (the first addend), you land at the point on the number line that that addend represents. From there you take the second step (the second addend) and end up at the final sum.\n\nBecause the final sum is \\(-2\\), the combined effect of the two steps must leave you two units left of 0. In other words, the two components \u201cbalance out\u201d so that their net movement ends at the point \\(-2\\).\n\n**Example**\n\n\\[\n-5 + 3 = -2\n\\]\n\n1. Start at 0.  \n2. Move \\(-5\\) units left \u2192 you reach \\(-5\\).  \n3. From \\(-5\\), move \\(+3\\) units right \u2192 you land at \\(-2\\).\n\nThe placement of the two components on the number line (one left, one right) and their magnitudes determine that the tip\u2011to\u2011tail addition of the two \u201cvectors\u201d ends at the point \\(-2\\). Thus the relationship is: the sum\u2019s position on the number line is exactly where the two component steps, taken sequentially, bring you."
