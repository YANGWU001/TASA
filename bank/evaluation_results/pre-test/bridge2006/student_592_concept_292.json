  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the concept of subtracting negative integers, particularly in Question 3. However, there are significant misunderstandings in most answers, especially in the rewriting of expressions and the final results. The student confuses subtraction with addition and does not consistently apply the correct rules. More practice and clarification on the concept of subtracting negative integers is needed.",

      "question": "Explain why subtracting a negative integer is equivalent to adding a positive integer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason subtracting a negative integer works like adding a positive one is because when you \u201ctake away\u201d a negative number you\u2019re kind of *removing* a debt.  So if you owe\u202f\u20133 dollars and you subtract that debt, you\u2019re basically getting rid of the \u201c\u20113,\u201d which leaves you with a +3.  In other words, the two minus signs sort of cancel each other out and turn into a plus, so  \n\n\\[\na - (-b) = a + b .\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure why the signs cancel, but I guess it\u2019s because a negative sign means \u201cthe opposite direction\u201d and two opposites make a forward direction, which is why we end up adding the positive amount."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 when you rewrite\u202f10\u202f-\u202f(-4) it just stays a subtraction, so it would become\u202f10\u202f-\u202f4."

If we have \\(-6 - (-9)\\), we\u2019re basically subtracting a negative, so maybe we add the numbers?\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think it would be \\(-6 + (-9)\\), which would give \\(-15\\). \n\nSo, I guess the rewritten result is \\(-15\\)."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think we can change the subtraction of the negative number into adding a negative. So  \n\n\\[\n-3 - (-5) \\;=\\; -3 + (-5)\n\\]\n\nThen we just combine the numbers:\n\n\\[\n-3 + (-5) = -8.\n\\]\n\nSo the rewritten form is \\(-3 + (-5)\\) and the result is \\(-8\\)."

      "question": "Provide a real-world example where subtracting a negative integer can be rewritten as addition.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011world situation could be something like the temperature example.  \nSay the temperature is\u202f\u20115\u202f\u00b0C and you \u201csubtract\u202f\u20113\u202f\u00b0C\u201d (like taking away a\u202f\u20113\u202f\u00b0C change).  I guess you would just do\u202f\u20115\u202f\u2212\u202f(\u20113)\u202f=\u202f\u20118\u202f\u00b0C, so you end up at\u202f\u20118\u202f\u00b0C.  \n\n(So the subtraction of the negative number is rewritten as adding the opposite.)"
