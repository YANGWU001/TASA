      "student_answer": "Percentages are a convenient way to express a part of a whole, so they\u2019re used all the time when we need to figure out how much of something we have or need.  \n\n**How it works**\n\n1. **Identify the whole amount** \u2013 This is the 100\u202f% value (e.g., the total cost of a grocery bill, the total distance of a trip, the total number of items in inventory).  \n2. **Determine the percent you need** \u2013 This is the proportion of the whole you\u2019re interested in (e.g., a discount of 15\u202f%, a tax rate of 8\u202f%, the portion of a class that passed an exam).  \n3. **Convert the percent to a decimal** \u2013 Divide the percent by 100 (15\u202f% \u2192 0.15, 8\u202f% \u2192 0.08).  \n4. **Multiply** \u2013 Multiply the decimal by the whole amount to get the part (e.g.,\u202f0.15\u202f\u00d7\u202f$200\u202f=\u202f$30 discount).  \n\n**Real\u2011world examples**\n\n| Situation | Whole (100\u202f%) | Percent needed | Decimal | Part (result) |\n|-----------|---------------|----------------|---------|----------------|\n| A store offers a 20\u202f% discount on a $45 shirt | $45 | 20\u202f% | 0.20 | $9 off \u2192 final price $36 |\n| Sales tax is 8\u202f% on a $120 purchase | $120 | 8\u202f% | 0.08 | $9.60 tax |\n| 25\u202f% of a class of 80 students passed the exam | 80 students | 25\u202f% | 0.25 | **20 students** passed |\n| A recipe calls for 30\u202f% of a cup of oil in a 2\u2011cup sauce | 2 cups | 30\u202f% | 0.30 | 0.6 cups of oil |\n\nNotice the third example: 25\u202f% of 80 is 20 (since 0.25\u202f\u00d7\u202f80\u202f=\u202f20).  \n\n**Why percentages are useful**\n\n* **Comparability** \u2013 Different quantities can be compared on the same 0\u2011100 scale (e.g., market\u2011share percentages).  \n* **Scalability** \u2013 Once you know the percent, you can quickly adjust the result for any size of the whole (e.g., a 15\u202f% tip on any restaurant bill).  \n* **Clarity** \u2013 People intuitively understand \u201cpercent\u201d as \u201cparts per hundred,\u201d which makes communication of proportions straightforward.\n\nIn summary, to calculate a part using a percentage, you turn the percentage into a decimal and multiply it by the total amount. This simple process underlies many everyday calculations, from discounts and taxes to statistics and recipe adjustments."

If you prefer, you can first convert the fraction to a decimal (\\(p/q\\)) and then multiply, but the result is the same.\n\n**Example**\n\nIf the whole is 80 and you need \u201c\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) of it\u201d:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Part}=80 \\times \\frac{3}{8}=80 \\times 0.375 = 30.\n\\]\n\nSo the part is 30."

      "question": "Describe the difference between calculating a part using percentages versus using fractions.",
      "student_answer": "**Percentages vs. fractions**\n\n- **What they represent**  \n  *A percentage* tells you how many parts out of **100** something is.  \n  *A fraction* tells you how many parts out of **any whole number** (the denominator) something is.\n\n- **How you set up the calculation**  \n  - With a percentage you first convert the percent to a decimal by dividing by\u202f100, then multiply by the whole amount.  \n    \\[\n    \\text{part} = \\frac{\\text{percent}}{100}\\times \\text{total}\n    \\]\n  - With a fraction you keep the numerator\u2011over\u2011denominator form and multiply directly.  \n    \\[\n    \\text{part} = \\frac{\\text{numerator}}{\\text{denominator}}\\times \\text{total}\n    \\]\n\n- **When you might prefer one over the other**  \n  *Percentages* are handy when the problem is stated in \u201cpercent of\u201d language (e.g., \u201c30\u202f% of 80\u201d).  \n  *Fractions* are useful when the relationship is given as a ratio or part of a whole that isn\u2019t 100 (e.g., \u201c\\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) of a pizza\u201d).\n\n- **Example**  \n  - 25\u202f% of 200:  \n    \\[\n    \\frac{25}{100}\\times200 = 0.25\\times200 = 50\n    \\]\n  - \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) of 200:  \n    \\[\n    \\frac{3}{5}\\times200 = 0.6\\times200 = 120\n    \\]\n\nIn short, percentages are just fractions whose denominator is 100; converting between the two is a matter of rewriting the denominator (100 for percent, whatever it naturally is for a fraction) and then performing the multiplication."
