  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of comparing products through multiplication, correctly identifying larger quantities in most cases. However, there were a few instances of incorrect answers, particularly in Questions 1, 6, and 8, where the calculations or comparisons were not fully accurate. Overall, the student shows good reasoning skills but should double-check their calculations and comparisons.",

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What is the larger product: 3 x 9 or 2 x 12?",
      "student_answer": "The product of\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f27, while\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f24. So the larger product is **3\u202f\u00d7\u202f9** (which equals\u202f27)."

      "student_answer": "The first farmer planted \\(4 \\times 9 = 36\\) trees.  \nThe second farmer planted \\(6 \\times 7 = 42\\) trees.  \n\nSo, I think the second farmer (the one with 6 rows of 7 trees) planted more trees."

      "student_answer": "I think Team\u202fA scored the higher total. (6\u202fpoints\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202fgames\u202f=\u202f48\u202fpoints, and I\u2019m guessing the other total is a little less.)"

      "question_number": 9,

      "student_answer": "Both products are the same:  \n\n\\(15 \\times 2 = 30\\)  \n\n\\(10 \\times 3 = 30\\)  \n\nSo neither expression gives a larger product; they are equal."
