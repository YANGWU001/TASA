      "question": "Describe the process to determine the number of equal divisions when using 4 vertical bars in a rectangular shape.",
      "student_answer": "To find how many equal parts a rectangle is divided into when you draw **four vertical bars**, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Draw the rectangle** \u2013 start with the outer boundary of the shape.\n\n2. **Mark equally\u2011spaced points** \u2013 on the top edge, locate five points that are spaced the same distance apart (the first point is at the left\u2011hand corner, the last point is at the right\u2011hand corner).  \n   - Do the same on the bottom edge so the points line up vertically with those on the top.\n\n3. **Draw the vertical bars** \u2013 connect each pair of matching points on the top and bottom edges with a straight vertical line.  \n   - Because you placed five equally\u2011spaced points, you will draw **four** interior vertical lines (the bars) between the outer edges.\n\n4. **Count the sections** \u2013 each bar creates a new strip, and the two outer edges of the rectangle also act as \u201cbars.\u201d  \n   - Therefore, the number of resulting equal vertical strips is **number of bars\u202f+\u202f1**.\n\nSo with **four vertical bars**, the rectangle is divided into **5 equal vertical divisions**."

      "question": "If a rectangle is divided by 5 evenly spaced vertical bars, how many equal sections are formed?",
      "student_answer": "The 5 evenly spaced vertical bars divide the rectangle into **6 equal sections**."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain why placing 6 vertical bars in a rectangle results in 7 equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "When you draw vertical bars inside a rectangle, each bar separates the space on its left from the space on its right. In addition to the spaces created **between** the bars, there are also the two outermost spaces: one between the left edge of the rectangle and the first bar, and another between the right edge of the rectangle and the last bar.  \n\nSo with 6 bars you get:\n\n- 1 space to the left of the first bar  \n- 1 space between each pair of consecutive bars (that\u2019s 5 spaces, because there are 6\u202f\u2013\u202f1 pairs)  \n- 1 space to the right of the last bar  \n\nAdding those together gives 1\u202f+\u202f5\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f7 equal sections. Each of those sections has the same width, so the 6 vertical bars divide the rectangle into **7 equal divisions**."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How does the number of vertical bars relate to the total number of equal divisions in a given shape?",
      "student_answer": "The vertical bars act as the \u201ccut\u2011lines\u201d that split the shape into equal parts.  \nEach bar creates a boundary between two neighboring sections, so the total\nnumber of equal divisions is **one more than the number of bars**.\n\n**In formula form**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of equal divisions} = \\text{Number of vertical bars} + 1\n\\]\n\n(If the bars are being used as the divisions themselves\u2014i.e., each bar\nrepresents a whole section\u2014then the two quantities are the same. In most\nstandard problems, however, the bars are the separators, so you add one.)"

      "question": "A rectangle has been divided into 8 equal parts. How many vertical bars were used to achieve this?",
      "student_answer": "To split a rectangle into\u202f8\u202fequal vertical sections you need one fewer bar than the number of sections.  \nSo, **7 vertical bars** are required."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Illustrate with an example how placing 10 vertical bars in a square creates multiple equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "**Example**\n\nTake a square that is 10\u202fcm on each side.  \nDraw 10 thin vertical bars inside the square, spacing them evenly from the left edge to the right edge.\n\n- Because the bars are equally spaced, the distance between any two consecutive bars (and also between a bar and the nearest edge of the square) is the same.  \n- With 10 bars you actually get **11** separate vertical strips \u2013 the space to the left of the first bar, the spaces between each pair of bars, and the space to the right of the last bar.  \n- Each strip therefore has a width of  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{10\\text{\u202fcm}}{11}\\approx 0.91\\text{\u202fcm}.\n\\]\n\nSo by placing 10 vertical bars in the square we have created **10 equal divisions** (the 10 spaces between the bars), each of which is the same size, and the whole square is now partitioned into a set of identical vertical sections.  \n\nThis visual shows how a series of evenly\u2011spaced vertical bars can turn a single shape into many equal parts."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If a student places 12 vertical bars on a rectangle, what formula can be used to calculate the number of equal divisions formed?",
      "student_answer": "The number of equal divisions created by placing vertical bars is one more than the number of bars, because each bar adds a new segment while the two outer edges of the rectangle also count as segments.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of divisions} = \\text{Number of vertical bars} + 1\n\\]\n\nSo with 12 vertical bars the rectangle would be divided into \\(12 + 1 = 13\\) equal sections."
