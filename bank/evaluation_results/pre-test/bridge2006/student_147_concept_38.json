      "student_answer": "To split a circle into five equal parts you need to create five arcs that each subtend the same central angle \u2013\u202f72\u00b0 (because 360\u00b0\u202f\u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f72\u00b0).  \nHere\u2019s a simple step\u2011by\u2011step way to do it with a ruler, a compass and a protractor:\n\n1. **Draw the circle**  \n   - Place the compass point at the desired center and draw a clean circle.\n\n2. **Mark a starting point**  \n   - Choose any point on the circumference and label it\u202fA.  \n   - Draw a radius from the center\u202fO to A; this will be the reference line for the first sector.\n\n3. **Set the protractor**  \n   - Place the protractor\u2019s center hole over O so that the 0\u00b0 line aligns with OA.\n\n4. **Measure the first 72\u00b0**  \n   - From the 0\u00b0 mark, count clockwise (or counter\u2011clockwise) to the 72\u00b0 mark on the protractor.  \n   - Make a small pencil mark on the circle at this point and label it\u202fB.\n\n5. **Repeat the measurement**  \n   - Without moving the protractor, continue measuring another 72\u00b0 from the 72\u00b0 position to the 144\u00b0 position.  \n   - Mark this point on the circle as\u202fC.\n\n6. **Continue until you have five points**  \n   - Keep adding 72\u00b0:  \n     * 144\u00b0 \u2192 216\u00b0 \u2192 point\u202fD  \n     * 216\u00b0 \u2192 288\u00b0 \u2192 point\u202fE  \n     * 288\u00b0 \u2192 360\u00b0 (or back to 0\u00b0) \u2192 point\u202fF, which will coincide with the original point\u202fA.\n\n7. **Draw the dividing radii**  \n   - Connect the center\u202fO to each of the five points (A, B, C, D, E) with straight lines.  \n   - These five radii split the circle into five congruent sectors, each covering 72\u00b0.\n\n8. **(Optional) Check the work**  \n   - Use the protractor again on any adjacent pair of radii (e.g., OA and OB) to verify that the angle is indeed 72\u00b0.  \n   - All five angles should be the same.\n\n**Result:** The circle is now divided into five equal sections (or sectors), each with the same central angle and arc length."

      "student_answer": "**How to divide a circle into equal sections**\n\n1. **Understand the total angle** \u2013 A full circle measures 360\u00b0.  \n2. **Decide how many equal parts you need** \u2013 let\u2019s call that number *n* (in this case *n*\u202f=\u202f9).  \n3. **Find the angle of each part** \u2013 Divide the total angle by the number of parts:  \n\n   \\[\n   \\text{angle per part} = \\frac{360^{\\circ}}{n}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Mark the first ray** \u2013 Choose any point on the circumference and draw a radius from the centre to that point. This will be your \u201cstarting line.\u201d  \n5. **Use a protractor or a compass** \u2013 Place the center of the protractor at the centre of the circle, align the 0\u2011degree mark with the starting radius, and then mark the next radius at the calculated angle.  \n6. **Repeat** \u2013 Continue measuring the same angle around the circle until you have drawn *n* radii. The points where the radii meet the circumference are the division points, and the arcs between consecutive radii are all equal.  \n\n**Angle for 9 equal divisions**\n\nApplying the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{angle per part} = \\frac{360^{\\circ}}{9} \\approx 45^{\\circ}\n\\]\n\nSo each of the nine sections should be about **45 degrees** wide. (You would then draw nine equally\u2011spaced radii, each 45\u00b0 apart.)"
