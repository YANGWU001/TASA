  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of isolating x in equations, as seen in most answers. However, there are significant errors in the first three responses, indicating confusion with basic subtraction. The detailed explanation in Question 6 shows a solid grasp of the concept, despite some uncertainty. Overall, the student is on the right track but needs to review the basics of solving simple equations.",

That would be incorrect for this problem, but it\u2019s a common slip.  \n\n6. **(Another possible slip)**  \n   Another error could be **dividing both sides by\u202f4**: \\(\\frac{x+4}{4} = \\frac{9}{4}\\).  This doesn\u2019t isolate\u202f\\(x\\) and would give a wrong answer.  \n\n7. **Final answer.**  \n   The correct value of\u202f\\(x\\) is **5**.  \n\n8. **(Uncertain note)**  \n   I\u2019m pretty sure the main idea is to undo the addition by subtraction, so the solution should be \\(x = 5\\), but if I missed a sign it could be different."
