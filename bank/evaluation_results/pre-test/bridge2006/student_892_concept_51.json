      "student_answer": "I think the fraction\u202f\\( \\frac{2}{7} \\) means the whole is divided into **7 equal groups**, and we have 2 of those groups. So the number of equal groups that can be formed is **7**."

      "question": "If you have 4/12 as a fraction, what does the numerator represent in terms of groups?",
      "student_answer": "I think the numerator\u202f4 tells you how many of the equal parts you have \u2013 in other words, it represents 4 of the 12 equal groups (or pieces) that make up the whole."

      "question": "Explain how the numerator and denominator of a fraction help in identifying equal groups.",
      "student_answer": "I think the numerator and denominator work together to show how a whole can be broken into equal groups.  \n\u2011 The denominator tells you **how many equal parts** the whole is divided into.  \n\u2011 The numerator tells you **how many of those equal parts** you are talking about (or using).  \n\nSo, for example, in the fraction \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) the \u201c4\u201d means the whole is split into four equal groups, and the \u201c3\u201d means we are looking at three of those groups. This helps us see both the size of each group (they\u2019re all the same because the denominator sets that) and how many groups are being considered (the numerator).  \n\nSometimes I get mixed up and think the numerator is the total number of groups, but actually it\u2019s the number of *selected* groups out of the total number shown by the denominator. This distinction is what lets us compare fractions and picture the equal\u2011group idea."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If a fraction is 7/15, how can you determine the number of equal groups represented?",
      "student_answer": "The denominator tells us how many equal parts the whole is divided into.  \nFor the fraction \\(\\frac{7}{15}\\) the denominator is **15**, so the whole is split into **15 equal groups** (and 7 of those groups are being taken).  \n\n*I think the number of equal groups represented by\u202f7\u204415 is 15.*"

      "question": "If there are 5 equal groups of a fraction, what could the numerator and denominator be?",
      "student_answer": "I think the \u201c5 equal groups\u201d tells us that the denominator should be\u202f5.  \nThe numerator can be any number of those groups that you\u2019re counting \u2013 for example  \n\n* 1\u20445\u202f means one of the five equal parts,  \n* 2\u20445\u202f means two of the five parts,  \n* \u2026 up to 5\u20445\u202f which would be the whole thing.  \n\nSo a possible fraction could be\u202f3\u20445 (three of the five equal groups), and in general the denominator is\u202f5 while the numerator can be any integer from\u202f1\u202fto\u202f5 (or 0 if you\u2019re talking about none of the groups)."

      "question": "Describe a real-world example where identifying the number of equal groups from a fraction is useful.",
      "student_answer": "One everyday situation where figuring out the number of equal groups from a fraction comes in handy is when we\u2019re sharing food that\u2019s been cut into equal pieces.\n\n**Example \u2013 Cutting a pizza**\n\nImagine a pizza that has been sliced into equal pieces.  \nIf the pizza is cut into\u202f8 slices, each slice represents\u202f\\( \\frac{1}{8} \\)\u202fof the whole pizza.  \nNow suppose you and a friend want to eat\u202f\\( \\frac{3}{8} \\)\u202fof the pizza. To know how many whole slices you need, you look at the denominator (8) to see how many equal groups the pizza is divided into, and then you take the numerator (3) of those groups. So you would need **3 out of the 8 equal slices**.\n\nIn this case the fraction tells you:\n\n* the **denominator** (8) \u2013 the total number of equal groups (or slices) the pizza is divided into, and  \n* the **numerator** (3) \u2013 how many of those equal groups you actually take.\n\nI think this kind of thinking is useful not only for pizza, but also for other things like:\n\n* dividing a cake into\u202f\\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)\u202fpieces for a party (you need 4 equal groups),  \n* sharing a bag of 12 cookies equally among 3 kids (the fraction\u202f\\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)\u202fmeans you split the bag into 3 equal groups), or  \n* measuring ingredients in a recipe, where\u202f\\( \\frac{2}{5} \\)\u202fcup of an ingredient means the measuring cup is divided into 5 equal parts and you use 2 of those parts.\n\nSo, recognizing that the denominator of a fraction tells you how many equal groups the whole is split into helps us decide how many pieces we actually need in real\u2011world sharing situations."
