      "question": "Describe the process to determine the number of equal divisions when using 4 vertical bars in a rectangular shape.",
      "student_answer": "**Step\u2011by\u2011step process**\n\n1. **Draw the rectangle** \u2013 Start with a clean, empty rectangle that represents the whole shape you want to divide.\n\n2. **Place the 4 vertical bars** \u2013  \n   * Mark four equally\u2011spaced vertical lines inside the rectangle.  \n   * Make sure the distance between each consecutive bar (including the distance from the left edge of the rectangle to the first bar, and from the last bar to the right edge) is the same.  \n\n3. **Count the resulting strips** \u2013  \n   * Each bar creates a new boundary.  \n   * The number of equal strips (or \u201cdivisions\u201d) is therefore **one more than the number of bars**, because you have a strip to the left of the first bar, a strip between every pair of bars, and a strip to the right of the last bar.  \n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of equal divisions}= \\text{Number of vertical bars}+1\n   \\]\n\n4. **Apply the formula** \u2013 With 4 vertical bars:  \n\n   \\[\n   4\\text{ bars}+1 = 5\\text{ equal divisions}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify** \u2013 Check that each of the five resulting vertical strips has the same width. If any strip is wider or narrower, adjust the positions of the bars until all widths match.\n\n**Result:** Using 4 equally\u2011spaced vertical bars inside a rectangle divides the shape into **5 equal vertical divisions**."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If a rectangle is divided by 5 evenly spaced vertical bars, how many equal sections are formed?",
      "student_answer": "The 5 vertical bars split the rectangle into **6 equal sections**. Each bar creates a new division, so with\u202fn\u202fbars you get\u202fn\u202f+\u202f1\u202fsections."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain why placing 6 vertical bars in a rectangle results in 7 equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "When you draw vertical bars inside a rectangle, each bar serves as a boundary between two neighboring regions.  \n\nIf you start with a blank rectangle, there is **one** region (the whole rectangle).  \nWhen you add the first vertical bar, it splits that single region into **two** regions: one on the left of the bar and one on the right.  \n\nAdding a second vertical bar creates another boundary. Because the new bar lies somewhere inside the rectangle, it divides one of the existing regions into two, increasing the total count by one. So after two bars you have **three** regions.  \n\nEach additional bar continues this pattern: it introduces one new boundary and therefore creates one more region than you had before.  \n\nThus, after placing **n** vertical bars, the number of equal\u2011sized vertical strips (divisions) is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{number of divisions} = n + 1\n\\]\n\nWith **6** vertical bars:\n\n\\[\n6 \\text{ bars} + 1 = 7 \\text{ equal divisions}\n\\]\n\nSo the rectangle is divided into seven equal vertical sections because each bar adds a new division, and the original rectangle counts as the first division before any bars are drawn."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How does the number of vertical bars relate to the total number of equal divisions in a given shape?",
      "student_answer": "The vertical bars act as division lines.  \n- **Each bar adds one more piece** to the shape.  \n- If a shape starts as a single whole (0 bars \u2192 1 piece), then **the total number of equal parts created by only vertical bars is**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of equal divisions}= \\text{(number of vertical bars)} + 1 .\n\\]\n\n**Why?** The bars are drawn\u202fevenly spaced across the shape. The first bar splits the whole into 2 parts, a second bar splits one of those parts (or adds a new split) giving 3 parts, and so on \u2013 each new bar creates one additional region.\n\n### Example\n- 1 vertical bar \u2192 2 equal rectangles.  \n- 3 vertical bars \u2192 4 equal rectangles.\n\n### When other directions are involved\nIf the shape also has horizontal bars, the total number of equal sub\u2011shapes is the product of the counts in each direction:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total pieces}= (\\text{vertical bars}+1)\\times(\\text{horizontal bars}+1).\n\\]\n\nSo, focusing only on vertical bars, remember: **bars\u202f+\u202f1 = total equal divisions**."

      "question": "A rectangle has been divided into 8 equal parts. How many vertical bars were used to achieve this?",
      "student_answer": "The rectangle was divided into 8 equal vertical strips, so you need **7 vertical bars** to create those 8 parts."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Illustrate with an example how placing 10 vertical bars in a square creates multiple equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "When ten vertical bars are placed **inside** a square and spaced evenly from the left\u2011hand side to the right\u2011hand side, they act as division lines that chop the square into a series of thin, equal\u2011width strips.\n\n**Example**\n\n1. Draw a square whose side length is 11\u202fcm.  \n2. Starting at the left edge, measure off 1\u202fcm intervals along the top (and bottom) edge and draw a short vertical mark at each point.  \n3. Connect the marks with straight lines that run the full height of the square.  \n\nThese ten straight lines are the ten vertical bars. Because the marks were made at 1\u2011cm intervals, the distance between any two consecutive bars (or between a bar and the nearest side of the square) is exactly 1\u202fcm.\n\n**Result**\n\n- The ten bars create **eleven** vertical strips inside the square.  \n- Each strip has the same width:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Width of each strip}= \\frac{\\text{side length of the square}}{11}= \\frac{11\\text{ cm}}{11}=1\\text{ cm}.\n\\]\n\nThus, by placing ten evenly spaced vertical bars in a square, we obtain multiple (in this case, eleven) equal divisions of the square. The same idea works for any number of bars: \\(n\\) vertical bars produce \\(n+1\\) equal vertical sections."

      "question": "If a student places 12 vertical bars on a rectangle, what formula can be used to calculate the number of equal divisions formed?",
      "student_answer": "The number of equal divisions created by vertical bars is one more than the number of bars you draw:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of equal divisions}= n + 1\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(n\\) = the number of vertical bars placed on the rectangle.\n\nSo with 12 vertical bars, the rectangle would be divided into \\(12 + 1 = 13\\) equal sections."
