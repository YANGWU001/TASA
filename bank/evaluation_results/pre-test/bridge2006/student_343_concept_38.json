  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of dividing circles into equal sections, correctly identifying the number of divisions and calculating angles for various scenarios. The only incorrect response was related to the angle calculation for 6 divisions, where the student mistakenly referenced a 460-degree circle instead of the correct 360 degrees. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the topic.",

      "student_answer": "To split a circle into five equal parts you need to create five central angles that are each \\(360^\\circ \\div 5 = 72^\\circ\\).  \nHere\u2019s a step\u2011by\u2011step way to do it with basic drawing tools (ruler, compass, protractor) or with just a compass if you prefer a construction\u2011only method.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Locate the centre\n1. Draw the circle and mark its centre \\(O\\).\n\n### 2. Lay off the first radius\n1. Choose any point on the circumference and call it \\(A\\).  \n2. Draw the radius \\(OA\\).\n\n### 3. Measure a 72\u00b0 angle (using a protractor)  \n1. Place the protractor\u2019s centre on \\(O\\) with the 0\u00b0 line aligned with \\(OA\\).  \n2. Mark the point where the 72\u00b0 mark meets the circle; call this point \\(B\\).  \n3. Draw the radius \\(OB\\).\n\n### 4. Repeat to get all five radii  \n1. From \\(OB\\) repeat the same step: align the 0\u00b0 line of the protractor with \\(OB\\) and mark the next 72\u00b0 point \\(C\\).  \n2. Draw \\(OC\\).  \n3. Continue the process to obtain points \\(D\\) and \\(E\\).\n\nAfter four repetitions you will have points \\(A, B, C, D, E\\) spaced evenly around the circle.\n\n### 5. Connect the radii\nDraw the five radii \\(OA, OB, OC, OD, OE\\). The circle is now divided into five equal sectors, each bounded by two adjacent radii.\n\n---\n\n## Compass\u2011only construction (no protractor)\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a protractor you can still get the 72\u00b0 divisions using a simple compass construction:\n\n1. **Draw a regular pentagon inside the circle**  \n   * From \\(O\\) draw a radius \\(OA\\).  \n   * With the compass set to the radius length, step around the circumference: place the compass point on \\(A\\), draw an arc that intersects the circle; label that intersection \\(B\\).  \n   * Keep the same radius and repeat from \\(B\\) to get \\(C\\), then \\(D\\), then \\(E\\), and finally back to \\(A\\).  \n\n   The points you\u2019ve marked are the vertices of a regular pentagon inscribed in the circle. The central angles between consecutive vertices are exactly 72\u00b0, so the radii to those vertices divide the circle into five equal sections.\n\n2. **Draw the radii** as before: connect \\(O\\) to each of \\(A, B, C, D, E\\).\n\n---\n\n### Quick checklist\n- **Number of sections:** 5  \n- **Angle for each sector:** \\(72^\\circ\\)  \n- **Key tools:** compass (to get the radius), protractor (to measure 72\u00b0) *or* just a compass (to step off equal chords).  \n\nFollowing either method will give you five congruent sectors, i.e., the circle is divided into five equal parts."

Make a small mark on the circumference where the measured line meets it.  \n5. **Repeat** \u2013 From the new mark, measure the same angle again and draw the next radius.
