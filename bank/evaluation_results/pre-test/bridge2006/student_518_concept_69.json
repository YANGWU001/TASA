  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the concept of multipliers in relation to rectangles, but there are significant misconceptions. Many answers reflect confusion about how multipliers affect dimensions and area, particularly in Questions 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10. The student correctly identified the multiplier in Questions 2 and 8, indicating some grasp of the concept, but overall, there is a need for further clarification and practice.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the multiplier if a rectangle has a length of 8 and the width is doubled?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the multiplier would be **4**.  Since the width is doubled, I guess the whole rectangle gets four times bigger or something like that."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a rectangle\u2019s length is multiplied by 3, what is the new length if the original length was 5?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the new length would be **10**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "A rectangle\u2019s area is increased by multiplying its length by 4. What is the multiplier applied to the length?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the multiplier applied to the length is **2**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "The width of a rectangle is tripled. What does the multiplier represent in this case?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the multiplier is\u202f2.  It means the width is being doubled, not tripled.  (So the \u201cmultiplier\u201d would be the factor that makes the width twice as long.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If the dimensions of a rectangle are multiplied by 2, what happens to the area of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if you multiply both the length and the width by\u202f2, the area only gets twice as big. So the new area would be double the original area."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A rectangle has a width of 6 meters. The width is multiplied by a factor of 5. What is the new width?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the new width would be about **11\u202fmeters**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the multiplier used if a rectangle\u2019s width is reduced to half its original size?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the multiplier would be **2** since the width is being changed."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is multiplied by 7, how does the multiplier affect the perimeter of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if you make the length seven times bigger, the whole perimeter just gets seven times bigger too. So the multiplier\u202f7 would also multiply the perimeter by\u202f7."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A rectangle\u2019s dimensions are scaled by multiplying both length and width by 3. What is the multiplier for each dimension?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the multiplier for each dimension might be **9**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "The area of a rectangle is doubled by changing the width. What multiplier was applied to the width?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the width has to be multiplied by about\u202f4\u202fto double the area. I'm not totally sure, but that seems right."
