      "student_answer": "**Answer:**\u202f7/5  \n\n**Explanation:** A fraction is improper when its numerator is larger than its denominator. Among the given options, only \\(7/5\\) has a numerator (7) greater than its denominator (5). The other fractions (\\(3/4\\), \\(2/3\\), \\(5/6\\)) are proper because their numerators are smaller than their denominators."

      "question": "What makes a fraction improper?",
      "student_answer": "An **improper fraction** is a fraction whose numerator is **greater than or\u202for equal to** its denominator.  \n\nIn other words, the top number (the part being divided) is at least as large as the bottom number (the divisor), so the value of the fraction is **\u2265\u202f1**.  \n\nFor example:  \n\n- \\(\\frac{7}{5}\\) \u2013 numerator\u202f7 > denominator\u202f5 \u2192 improper  \n- \\(\\frac{9}{9}\\) \u2013 numerator\u202f9 = denominator\u202f9 \u2192 improper (value\u202f=\u202f1)  \n\nImproper fractions can be rewritten as mixed numbers (e.g., \\(\\frac{7}{5} = 1\\frac{2}{5}\\)), but the defining characteristic is simply that the numerator is not smaller than the denominator."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is 11/10 classified as an improper fraction?",
      "student_answer": "\\( \\displaystyle \\frac{11}{10} \\) is called an **improper fraction** because the numerator (11) is larger than the denominator (10).  \n\nA fraction is **proper** when its numerator is smaller than its denominator, which makes its value less than\u202f1. When the numerator is equal to or greater than the denominator, the fraction\u2019s value is **greater than or equal to 1**, so it is classified as **improper**.  \n\nSince  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{11}{10}=1.1>1,\n\\]\n\nthe fraction meets the definition of an improper fraction. (It can also be expressed as the mixed number \\(1\\frac{1}{10}\\), but in its original form it remains an improper fraction.)"
