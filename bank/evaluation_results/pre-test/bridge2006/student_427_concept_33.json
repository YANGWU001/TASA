  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of counting shaded parts, correctly identifying them in several instances. However, there are significant errors in some answers, particularly in misunderstanding the total number of shaded parts in certain scenarios. The student should focus on accurately interpreting the number of shaded sections given in the questions.",

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A vertical bar split into 9 sections has 6 shaded parts. How would you count these shaded parts?",
      "student_answer": "To count the shaded parts you simply go through the bar one segment at a time and tally each shaded segment you see.  \n\nFor example, start at the bottom (or the top) and move upward, putting a tick\u2011mark or saying \u201cone, two, three\u2026\u201d each time you encounter a shaded piece.\u202fWhen you finish the whole bar you will have counted all of the shaded sections.  \n\nDoing that for this bar gives you **6 shaded parts**."
