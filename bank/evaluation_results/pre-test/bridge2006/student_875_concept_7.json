  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of addition and comparison of sums, correctly identifying larger quantities in most cases. However, there are some errors, particularly in questions 1, 5, and 8, where the student misjudged the larger sums. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concept but needs to double-check calculations and comparisons.",
