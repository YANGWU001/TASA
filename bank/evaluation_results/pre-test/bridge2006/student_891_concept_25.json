      "student_answer": "The least common multiple (LCM) of a set of numbers is the smallest positive integer that all of the numbers divide into evenly. In other words, it\u2019s the first number you encounter that is a multiple of each of the original numbers.  \n\nI think it can also be thought of as the \u201ccombined\u201d size of the numbers \u2013 you\u2019re looking for the smallest common \u201cstep size\u201d that lines up with each of the numbers\u2019 own steps. (Sometimes people say it\u2019s the product of the numbers divided by their greatest common divisor, which works for two numbers.)  \n\nSo basically, the LCM tells you the minimal number that is a multiple of every number in the group."

      "question": "Why is the LCM of two prime numbers always equal to their product?",
      "student_answer": "The reason is that prime numbers have no common factors except\u202f1.  \n\nIf \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are two (different) primes, the only divisor they share is 1, so any common multiple must contain both\u202f\\(p\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(q\\)\u202fas factors. The smallest positive integer that includes both of those prime factors is just their product \\(p \\times q\\).  \n\nTherefore the least common multiple of two primes is equal to their product.   (If the primes happen to be the same, the LCM is just that prime itself, but for two distinct primes it\u2019s \\(p q\\).)"

First find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the two numbers.  \n   - \\(18 = 2 \\times 3^2\\)  \n   - \\(24 = 2^3 \\times 3\\)  \n   The common prime factors are one 2 and one 3, so the GCF is \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\).\n\n2. Use the relationship between the product of the two numbers, their GCF, and their LCM:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(a,b)=\\frac{a \\times b}{\\text{GCF}(a,b)}.\n\\]\n\n3. Plug in the numbers:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(18,24)=\\frac{18 \\times 24}{6}= \\frac{432}{6}=72.\n\\]\n\nSo, by first finding the GCF (6), we can quickly compute the LCM as the product divided by that GCF, giving an LCM of **72**."
