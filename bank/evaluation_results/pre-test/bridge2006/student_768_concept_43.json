  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of fractions associated with parts of a horizontal bar. Most answers are correct, but there was a mistake in Question 4 where the student simplified incorrectly. In Question 10, the student provided the correct fraction but did not state the final answer clearly. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the concept.",
