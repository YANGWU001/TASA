      "student_answer": "The least\u2011common multiple (LCM) is the smallest positive number that is a multiple of **both** given numbers.\n\n- Multiples of 5 are\u20035,\u202f10,\u202f15,\u202f20,\u202f25,\u202f\u2026  \n- Multiples of 20 are\u200320,\u202f40,\u202f60,\u202f\u2026\n\nThe first (smallest) number that appears in both lists is **20**.  \n\nSince 20\u202f=\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f4, it is a multiple of 5, and of course 20\u202f=\u202f20\u202f\u00d7\u202f1, so it is also a multiple of 20. Because there is no smaller positive number that works for both, the LCM of 5 and 20 must be 20.  \n\nSo, the LCM(5,\u202f20)\u202f=\u202f20."

      "student_answer": "The least common multiple (LCM) of 8 and 24 is **24**.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\n- The LCM is the smallest number that both original numbers divide into without a remainder.\n- Since 24 \u00f7 8 = 3 (an integer) and 24 \u00f7 24 = 1, 24 is a multiple of both 8 and 24.\n- There is no smaller positive number that both 8 and 24 divide into, so the LCM is 24."

      "student_answer": "**True.**  \nIf one number is a multiple of the other, say \\(a = k \\, b\\) for some integer \\(k\\ge 1\\), then every common multiple of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be a multiple of \\(a\\) (because \\(a\\) already contains all the factors of \\(b\\)). The smallest such common multiple is therefore \\(a\\) itself, which is the larger number. Hence the LCM of the two numbers is the larger (the multiple) number."

      "question": "A student claims the LCM of 7 and 21 is 7. Is this correct? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "No, the claim is not correct.  \n\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of **both** numbers.  \n- 7 is a multiple of itself, but it is **not** a multiple of 21 (21 \u00f7 7 = 3, so 7 does not go evenly into 21).  \n- The next common multiple of 7 and 21 is 21 itself, because 21\u202f=\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 and 21\u202f=\u202f21\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.  \n\nTherefore the LCM of 7 and 21 is 21, not 7. (I think this is the right answer.)"

      "question": "If the LCM of two numbers is the larger number, what can you infer about their relationship?",

      "question": "Solve: Find the LCM of 15 and 45 and describe how knowing one is a multiple of the other simplifies the calculation.",
      "student_answer": "The least\u2011common multiple of 15 and 45 is **45**.\n\n**Why this is easy:**  \nSince 45 is already a multiple of 15 (\u202f45\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f), the larger number automatically contains all the prime factors needed to cover the smaller one. Therefore the LCM does not have to be found by listing multiples or using the full prime\u2011factor method \u2013 you can simply take the larger number, 45, as the LCM."
