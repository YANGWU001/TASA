  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of comparing products through multiplication. Most answers are correct, but there were two instances (Question 1 and Question 9) where the student incorrectly stated that the products were equal instead of identifying a larger quantity.

      "student_answer": "Both products are equal:\n\n- \\(5 \\times 8 = 40\\)\n- \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\)\n\nSince the two results are the same, neither expression is larger than the other."
