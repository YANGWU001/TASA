      "student_answer": "The square is divided into **4** smaller equal squares."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into 16 equal smaller squares, they are arranged in a 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 grid.  \nSo there are **4 rows** and **4 columns** of smaller squares."
    },

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "A square is divided into 25 equal parts. How many parts are in each row?",
      "student_answer": "Each row contains **5** equal parts."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into a greater number of equal sections, each individual part gets smaller \u2013 its area (and side length, if the pieces are also squares) decreases proportionally so that the total area of all the pieces still adds up to the original square."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "If a square is divided horizontally and vertically into 4 equal sections, what is the shape of each section?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the four sections is itself a smaller square."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013 a square can be divided into equal (congruent) triangles.\n\nOne simple way is to draw a diagonal from one corner of the square to the opposite corner. The diagonal splits the square into two right\u2011angled triangles that have exactly the same side lengths and the same area, so they are equal.\n\nYou can also get more than two equal triangles. For example, draw both diagonals; the square is now divided into four smaller right\u2011isosceles triangles that are all congruent. Or you can divide the square into a grid of smaller squares and then cut each small square along a diagonal, giving many equal triangles.\n\nSo there is no geometric restriction that forces a square to be partitioned only into smaller squares; equal\u2011area (and even congruent) triangles are perfectly possible."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "The square must be split into a \\(6 \\times 6\\) grid (since \\(6^2 = 36\\)).  \nSo each smaller square\u2019s side length is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{6}=2.\n\\]\n\n**Answer: each side of the smaller squares is 2 units long.**"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When we cut a square into several equal rectangles we keep the overall shape of the original figure (four right\u2011angled corners) but we change the proportions of each piece.  \n\nA **square** is a special type of rectangle whose two side lengths are exactly the same.  \nA **rectangle** only requires that all four angles are right angles; its length and width can be different.\n\nIf we divide a square by drawing one or more straight cuts that are parallel to a side, each new piece will have one dimension equal to the side of the original square and the other dimension equal to only a fraction of that side. For example, cutting a square in half vertically gives two pieces that are \\( \\text{side} \\times \\frac{\\text{side}}{2} \\). Their length and width are not equal, so they are rectangles, not squares.\n\nOnly when the cuts are arranged so that each piece\u2019s length and width stay the same (for instance, dividing the square into a grid of smaller squares) will the resulting parts also be squares. Otherwise the aspect ratio of each piece is altered, and the pieces remain rectangles."

      "question": "Draw a square divided into 9 equal sections and label the dimensions of each smaller square if the original square has a side length of 3 units.",
      "student_answer": "Here is a simple representation of the large square split into\u202f9 equal smaller squares (a\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid).  \n\n```\n+---+---+---+\n|   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+\n|   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+\n|   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+\n```\n\n- The original square has a side length of **3\u202funits**.  \n- Because it is divided into 3 equal rows and 3 equal columns, each small square is a **1\u202funit\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202funit** square.  \n\nSo the dimensions of each of the nine smaller squares are **1\u202funit on each side**."
