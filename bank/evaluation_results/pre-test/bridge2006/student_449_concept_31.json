      "student_answer": "**How to work out the equal divisions when you draw four vertical bars inside a rectangle**\n\n1. **Find the total width of the rectangle.**  \n   Measure (or note) the length of the horizontal side that will be divided by the bars.\n\n2. **Decide what you want to count as a \u201cdivision.\u201d**  \n   In most classroom problems the bars themselves are the boundaries of the parts, so the number of parts you get equals the number of bars you draw. (If the bars were only interior lines, you would end up with one more part than the number of bars, but the usual interpretation for \u201c4 vertical bars\u201d is that they create 4 equal strips.)\n\n3. **Calculate the width of each division.**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Width of one strip}=\\frac{\\text{Total width of the rectangle}}{\\text{Number of divisions}}\n   \\]\n   Since you are using four bars, you divide the total width by\u202f4.\n\n4. **Mark the positions of the bars.**  \n   Starting from the left\u2011hand edge, measure the width you just calculated and make a faint mark.  Draw a vertical line (the first bar) through that mark.  Repeat the measurement three more times; each new mark will be the location of the next bar.  After the fourth bar the right\u2011hand edge of the rectangle will be reached automatically.\n\n5. **Check the spacing.**  \n   The distance between any two consecutive bars, and between the outer edges of the rectangle and the nearest bar, should all be identical.  If they are, the rectangle has been divided into **four equal vertical sections**.\n\n6. **Count the sections to confirm.**  \n   Starting at the left edge, count each strip that lies between two successive bars (or between the left edge and the first bar).  You should end up with four equal strips.\n\n---\n\n**Quick summary:**  \n- Measure the rectangle\u2019s width.  \n- Divide that width by\u202f4 (the number of vertical bars you plan to draw).  \n- Place the four bars at equal intervals based on that division.  \n- The rectangle is now split into **four equal vertical divisions**.  \n\n*(If you ever treat the bars as interior lines only, remember that the number of pieces would be \u201cbars\u202f+\u202f1.\u201d In the typical \u201c4 vertical bars\u201d wording, however, the intended answer is four equal parts.)*"

      "student_answer": "When 5 evenly\u2011spaced vertical bars are drawn across a rectangle, each bar creates a new boundary.  \nSo the rectangle is split into  \n\n\\[\n5 \\text{ bars} + 1 = 6\n\\]\n\nequal vertical sections.  \n\n**Answer: 6 sections.**"

      "question": "Explain why placing 6 vertical bars in a rectangle results in 7 equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "When the vertical bars are drawn inside a rectangle, each bar acts as a boundary that separates one region from the next.  \n\n1. **Count the boundaries:**  \n   - The rectangle itself has two vertical edges (the left\u2011hand side and the right\u2011hand side).  \n   - Adding 6 interior vertical bars gives a total of **8** parallel lines that run from the top edge to the bottom edge of the rectangle.\n\n2. **Count the spaces between the boundaries:**  \n   - The first region is the space between the left edge of the rectangle and the first interior bar.  \n   - The next region is the space between the first bar and the second bar, and so on.  \n   - The last region is the space between the sixth bar and the right edge of the rectangle.\n\n   Because there are 8 lines, the number of gaps (or \u201cdivisions\u201d) between consecutive lines is one less than the number of lines:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of divisions}=8-1 = 7.\n\\]\n\n3. **Equal size:**  \n   If the rectangle\u2019s width is divided evenly\u2014meaning the distance from one line to the next is the same for all adjacent pairs\u2014then each of the 7 gaps has the same width. Hence the rectangle is split into **7 equal vertical strips**.\n\nSo, six interior vertical bars, together with the rectangle\u2019s two side edges, create eight parallel boundaries, which in turn produce seven equal divisions."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How does the number of vertical bars relate to the total number of equal divisions in a given shape?",
      "student_answer": "The vertical bars are the visual markers that split the shape into equal parts.  \nEach time you draw a new vertical bar you create **one more segment** between the bars (or between a bar and the edge of the shape).  \n\nTherefore  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of equal divisions} = \\text{Number of vertical bars} + 1\n\\]\n\nFor example  \n\n* 1 vertical bar \u2192 2 equal parts  \n* 2 vertical bars \u2192 3 equal parts  \n* 3 vertical bars \u2192 4 equal parts  \n\nThe rule holds for any shape that is being divided only by vertical lines (e.g., a rectangle, a strip, a number line, etc.). The bars themselves are not counted as separate \u201cparts\u201d; they are the boundaries that define the parts."

      "student_answer": "**Example**\n\n1. **Draw a square** \u2013 start with a plain outline of a square on a piece of paper (or on a computer screen).\n\n2. **Divide the side into ten equal parts** \u2013 measure the width of the square and mark nine equally\u2011spaced points along the top edge (the first point is the left\u2011hand corner, the last point is the right\u2011hand corner).  \n\n   ![Top edge with ten equal sections]  \n\n3. **Place a vertical bar at each mark** \u2013 from each of the ten marks (including the two corners), draw a straight vertical line down to the bottom edge of the square.  \n\n   ```\n   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n   ```\n\n4. **Resulting equal divisions** \u2013 the nine spaces **between** the ten bars are all exactly the same width; each one is one\u2011tenth of the total width of the square. In other words, the single square has been divided into **nine equal vertical strips** (or, if you count the strips that include the outermost bars, into ten equal strips).  \n\n   ```\n   \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n   \u2502| | | | | | | | | ||\n   \u2502| | | | | | | | | ||\n   \u2502| | | | | | | | | ||\n   \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n   ```\n\n5. **Why this works** \u2013 because the bars are spaced uniformly, every region bounded by two consecutive bars (or a bar and the square\u2019s side) has the same horizontal length. Hence the square is split into multiple **equal** vertical divisions simply by placing the ten vertical bars.\n\nSo, by inserting ten equally\u2011spaced vertical bars across a square, you create a set of identical vertical sections\u2014an illustration of how multiple equal divisions arise from a set of vertical bars."
