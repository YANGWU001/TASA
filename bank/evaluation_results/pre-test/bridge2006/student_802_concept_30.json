      "question": "Explain how the GCF helps in dividing items into equal groups.",
      "student_answer": "The Greatest Common Factor (GCF) is the biggest whole number that can divide two (or more) quantities without leaving a remainder.  When you\u2019re trying to split a set of objects into equal groups, the GCF tells you the largest possible size each group can have while still using all of the objects.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers you\u2019re working with.**  \n   For example, imagine you have 24 apples and 36 oranges and you want to make mixed fruit bags that contain the same number of each fruit.\n\n2. **Find the GCF of those numbers.**  \n   The GCF of 24 and 36 is 12.\n\n3. **Use the GCF as the group\u2011size.**  \n   Because 12 is the biggest number that goes into both 24 and 36, you can make each bag contain 12 pieces of fruit (say, 12 apples\u202f+\u202f12 oranges).  \n\n4. **Determine how many groups you get.**  \n   Since each bag has 12 items, you\u2019ll end up with 24\u202f\u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f2 apple\u2011only groups and 36\u202f\u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f3 orange\u2011only groups, which you can then combine into 2 mixed bags (or, if you choose to keep the groups separate, you\u2019ll have the fewest possible groups overall).\n\nIn short, the GCF gives you the **maximum number of items that can go into each equal group**, which in turn means you end up with the **fewest possible groups** while still using every item.  If you tried a smaller common factor (like 6), you\u2019d get more, smaller groups; the GCF just gives you the \u201cbiggest\u2011possible\u2011equal\u2011chunks\u201d solution.  \n\nSo, by finding the GCF you\u2019re essentially figuring out the best way to divide the items evenly without leftovers."

      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor of 45 and\u202f60 is **15**.\n\nIf we make groups that are all the same size, each group can contain **15 items**.  \nThat means:\n\n- 45\u202f\u00f7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f3 groups of 15 items, and  \n- 60\u202f\u00f7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f4 groups of 15 items."

      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) of 16,\u202f24 and\u202f40 is **8**.\n\nIf each group must contain 8 items, then each number can be split into groups of 8 like this:\n\n- 16 \u00f7\u202f8 = **2** groups  \n- 24 \u00f7\u202f8 = **3** groups  \n- 40 \u00f7\u202f8 = **5** groups  \n\nSo, from the three numbers together you can make **2\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f10 groups** of 8 items each."

By finding the greatest common factor of 24 and 36, the teacher can figure out the largest possible group size that works for both supplies.  The GCF of\u202f24\u202fand\u202f36 is\u202f12, so the teacher could make groups of 12 students, giving each student 2 pencils (24\u202f\u00f7\u202f12) and 3 markers (36\u202f\u00f7\u202f12).  This way every student gets the same amount and nothing is wasted.  (I think this is the kind of situation where the GCF is useful for organizing items into equal groups.)"
