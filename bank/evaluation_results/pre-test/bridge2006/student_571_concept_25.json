  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of LCM concepts, but there are several inaccuracies in calculations and explanations. They correctly identified the LCM for some pairs but struggled with others, particularly when using methods like prime factorization. The student should focus on clearly defining LCM and practicing calculations to improve accuracy.",

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain what the least common multiple represents in mathematical terms.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the least common multiple, or LCM, is the smallest number that you can get by multiplying the given numbers together\u2026 so it\u2019s basically the product of the numbers, but you try to make it as small as possible. In other words, it\u2019s the \u201cleast\u201d common multiple that all the numbers share, kind of like the opposite of the greatest common factor.  \n\nSo if you have, say, 3 and 4, the LCM would be 12 because that\u2019s the smallest number that both 3 and 4 can go into\u2026 or at least that\u2019s what I remember. It\u2019s the number that shows up when you line up the multiples of each integer and pick the first one they have in common.  \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure if I\u2019m mixing up any definitions, but that\u2019s the idea I have.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of 15 and 20 is **30**.\n\nI tried to use prime factorization.  \n- For 15 I got the factors \\(3 \\times 5\\).  \n- For 20 I wrote the factors as \\(2 \\times 2 \\times 5\\).  \n\nThen I just took the highest power of each prime that appears: \\(2^2\\) (from 20), \\(3^1\\) (from 15), and \\(5^1\\) (common). Multiplying those together I got \\(2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 4 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 30\\).  \n\nSo the least common multiple should be 30."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the least common multiple of 8 and 12 is **20**.\n\nHere\u2019s how I tried to find it:\n\n1. I listed a few multiples of 8: 8,\u202f16,\u202f24,\u202f32,\u202f\u2026  \n2. Then I listed a few multiples of 12: 12,\u202f24,\u202f36,\u202f48,\u202f\u2026  \n3. I looked for a number that seemed to appear in both lists, and I thought 20 might work because it\u2019s close to the other numbers.  \n\nSo, I guessed that 20 is the smallest number that both 8 and 12 can divide into. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "question": "How can you use a number line to visually determine the LCM of 2 and 5?",
      "student_answer": "Um, so\u2026 you\u2019d draw a horizontal line and put zero at the left edge. Then you start marking the multiples of 2\u2014like 2, 4, 6, 8, \u2026\u2014and also mark the multiples of 5\u2014like 5, 10, 15, \u2026\u2014on the same line.\u202fThe idea is to look for the first spot where both sets line up.\u202fI think the first place they meet is\u2026 maybe around 7?\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but it seems like that\u2019s where the two sequences intersect, so the LCM would be that number.  (Sorry if that\u2019s not right.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Why is the LCM of two prime numbers always equal to their product?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the reason the least common multiple of two prime numbers is just their product is because primes don\u2019t share any factors besides\u202f1. Since the only common divisor they have is\u202f1, the smallest number that both of them divide into has to include each prime once, so you end up multiplying them together.  \n\n(Though I\u2019m a little fuzzy on the details\u2014maybe it also has something to do with the fact that primes are odd? I\u2019m not completely sure.)"

      "question": "Solve for the LCM of 18 and 24, and describe how finding the greatest common factor (GCF) can help in the process.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the least common multiple of 18 and 24 is **48**.\n\nThe way I usually do it is to first find the greatest common factor (GCF).  \nYou can get the GCF by looking for the biggest number that divides both numbers \u2013 for 18 and 24, I guess the GCF is 6.  \nThen you sort of \u201csubtract\u201d the GCF from the product of the two numbers:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM} \\approx \\frac{18 \\times 24}{\\text{GCF}} = \\frac{432}{6} = 72,\n\\]\n\nbut since we\u2019re looking for the *least* common multiple, you actually take a step back and use the GCF to combine the shared factors and then multiply the remaining ones.  \nSo you\u2019d keep the 6, and then multiply the extra parts (3 from 18 and 4 from 24) to get \\(6 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 72\\).  \n\nBut I think, because sometimes the extra factors overlap, you might end up with a smaller number, like 48, after you cancel out one of the 2\u2019s that appears in both numbers. So the final LCM I\u2019m going with is **48**. \n\nSorry if that\u2019s a bit confusing\u2014my method isn\u2019t totally solid yet."
