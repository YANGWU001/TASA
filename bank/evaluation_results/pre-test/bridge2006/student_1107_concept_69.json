      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the multiplier if a rectangle has a length of 8 and the width is doubled?",
      "student_answer": "The width is being multiplied by\u202f2 (it\u2019s doubled), so the multiplier is **2**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a rectangle\u2019s length is multiplied by 3, what is the new length if the original length was 5?",
      "student_answer": "The new length is  \n\\[\n5 \\times 3 = 15.\n\\]  \n\n**Answer: 15**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "A rectangle\u2019s area is increased by multiplying its length by 4. What is the multiplier applied to the length?",
      "student_answer": "The length is multiplied by **4**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "The width of a rectangle is tripled. What does the multiplier represent in this case?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier is **3**.  \nIt tells us that the new width is three\u202ftimes the original width \u2013 i.e., the width has been scaled up by a factor of three."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If the dimensions of a rectangle are multiplied by 2, what happens to the area of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "When both the length and the width of a rectangle are each multiplied by\u202f2, the new area is  \n\n\\[\nA_{\\text{new}} = (2\\text{length})\\times(2\\text{width}) = 4(\\text{length}\\times\\text{width}) = 4A_{\\text{original}} .\n\\]\n\nSo the area is **quadrupled** \u2013 it becomes four times as large as the original area."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A rectangle has a width of 6 meters. The width is multiplied by a factor of 5. What is the new width?",
      "student_answer": "The new width is  \n\n\\[\n6 \\text{ m} \\times 5 = 30 \\text{ meters}.\n\\]"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the multiplier used if a rectangle\u2019s width is reduced to half its original size?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier is **0.5** (i.e., the width is multiplied by one\u2011half)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is multiplied by 7, how does the multiplier affect the perimeter of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a rectangle is  \n\n\\[\nP = 2(L+W)\n\\]\n\nIf only the length is multiplied by 7, the new length becomes \\(7L\\) while the width \\(W\\) stays the same.  \nThe new perimeter is  \n\n\\[\nP' = 2\\bigl(7L + W\\bigr)= 14L + 2W .\n\\]\n\nCompare this with the original perimeter:\n\n\\[\nP = 2L + 2W .\n\\]\n\nThe increase in perimeter is  \n\n\\[\nP' - P = (14L + 2W) - (2L + 2W) = 12L .\n\\]\n\nSo the multiplier of 7 on the length does **not** multiply the entire perimeter by 7.  \nIt adds an extra \\(12L\\) to the perimeter, giving a new perimeter of  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{P' = 2(7L + W) = 14L + 2W }.\n\\]"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A rectangle\u2019s dimensions are scaled by multiplying both length and width by 3. What is the multiplier for each dimension?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier applied to each dimension (both length and width) is **3**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "The area of a rectangle is doubled by changing the width. What multiplier was applied to the width?",
      "student_answer": "The width must be multiplied by **2**."
