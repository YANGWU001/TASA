      "question": "Explain what the greatest common factor (GCF) represents in mathematics.",
      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF), also called the greatest common divisor (GCD), is the largest positive integer that divides each of a given set of whole numbers exactly (i.e., with no remainder). In other words, it is the biggest number that is a factor of every number in the set. \n\nFor example, the numbers 12 and 18 both have the factors\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f6,\u202f12 and\u202f18,\u202f12,\u202frespectively. The common factors are\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202fand\u202f6, and the greatest of these is\u202f6; thus, the GCF of\u202f12 and\u202f18 is\u202f6.\n\nThe GCF is useful for simplifying fractions, reducing ratios, and solving problems that involve partitioning objects into equal groups. It tells us the largest size of a \u201cbuilding block\u201d that can be used to compose each of the numbers without leftovers."
