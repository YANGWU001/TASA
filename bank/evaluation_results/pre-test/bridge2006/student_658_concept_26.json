      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) of two or more integers is the largest positive integer that divides each of those numbers evenly (i.e., with no remainder). In other words, it is the biggest number that all the given integers share as a factor.\n\n**Key points about the GCF**\n\n1. **Common factor:** A factor that each of the numbers has in common.  \n2. **Greatest:** Among all common factors, the GCF is the one with the greatest value.  \n3. **Uses:**  \n   - Simplifying fractions (by dividing numerator and denominator by their GCF).  \n   - Reducing ratios to their simplest form.  \n   - Factoring expressions in algebra (e.g., extracting the GCF from a polynomial).  \n   - Solving problems that involve dividing objects into the largest possible equal groups.\n\n**Example:**  \nFor the numbers 24 and\u202f36, the factors are:  \n- 24: 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f12,\u202f24  \n- 36: 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f12,\u202f18,\u202f36  \n\nThe common factors are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f12, and the greatest of these is **12**. Thus, GCF(24,\u202f36)\u202f=\u202f12.\n\nSo, the GCF tells us the largest size of a \u201cunit\u201d that can be used to equally partition or factor all the given numbers."
