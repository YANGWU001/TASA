  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the concept of subtracting negative integers, particularly in their explanation in Question 3 and the real-world example in Question 8. However, most answers demonstrate confusion, particularly in rewriting the expressions correctly and understanding the operations involved. The student needs to focus on the principle that subtracting a negative integer is equivalent to adding its positive counterpart.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think subtracting a negative integer is kind of the same as just taking away a positive number, so you end up with a smaller result. Like if you have\u202f5\u202f\u2013\u202f(\u20133), you\u2019re actually doing\u202f5\u202f\u2013\u202f3, which would give you\u202f2. I guess the \u201cnegative\u201d sign in front of the\u202f3\u202fcancels out, but I\u2019m not really sure why it turns into a plus. Maybe it\u2019s because two negatives make a positive, so you just add the number instead of subtracting it."
