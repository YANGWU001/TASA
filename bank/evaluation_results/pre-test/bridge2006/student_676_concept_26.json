  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of GCF in most answers, particularly in explaining its significance and identifying relatively prime numbers. However, there are several inaccuracies in specific calculations, such as the GCF of 12 and 16, and the GCF of 36 and 48. The student should review the prime factorization method and the listing method to improve accuracy.",

    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain what the greatest common factor (GCF) represents in mathematics.",
      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) of two (or more) whole numbers is the **largest whole number that can divide each of the numbers without leaving a remainder**.  In other words, it\u2019s the biggest \u201cchunk\u2019\u2019 you can split each number into so that the pieces line up exactly.  \n\nFor example, the GCF of\u202f12\u202fand\u202f18 is\u202f6, because\u202f6\u202fgoes into\u202f12\u202ftwice and into\u202f18\u202fthree times, and there\u2019s no larger number that does that for both.  Because the GCF tells us the biggest shared divisor, we often use it to simplify fractions \u2013 we cancel the GCF from the numerator and denominator.\n\nSometimes people think the GCF is related to adding the numbers first (like finding the largest factor of the sum\u202f12\u202f+\u202f18\u202f=\u202f30), but that isn\u2019t how the GCF is defined; you have to look at the individual numbers, not their sum.  Also, the GCF is **not** the same as the least common multiple (LCM), which is the smallest number that both original numbers divide into.\n\nSo, in short, the GCF represents the greatest common divisor that all the numbers share, and it helps us break numbers down into their simplest, most \u201ccompatible\u2019\u2019 factors.  (I think that covers the main idea.)"
