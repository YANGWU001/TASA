  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of converting percentages to improper fractions, but there are several inaccuracies in simplification and understanding of what constitutes an improper fraction. Specifically, answers for 75%, 60%, 90%, and 66.6% were incorrect due to simplification errors or misinterpretation of improper fractions. The student should focus on correctly simplifying fractions and understanding the definition of improper fractions.",
