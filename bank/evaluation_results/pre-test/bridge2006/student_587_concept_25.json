You can label a few of them to keep the picture clear.  \n3. **Mark the multiples of 5** on the same line: starting from 0, make a tick at every 5 units (5,\u202f10,\u202f15,\u202f20,\u2026). Use a different color or a different shape for these ticks so you can tell the two sets apart.  \n4. **Look for the first point where the two sets of ticks line up** (i.e., a point that is both a multiple of 2 and a multiple of 5).  \n   - The first common tick you see is at **10**.  \n   - All earlier ticks (2,\u202f4,\u202f5,\u202f6,\u202f8) belong to only one of the two lists.  \n\n5. **Conclusion**: The smallest number that appears on both lists is 10, so  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{LCM}(2,5)=10}\n\\]\n\n> **Why this works:**  \n> The number line displays the sequences of multiples of each integer.

      "question": "Why is the LCM of two prime numbers always equal to their product?",
      "student_answer": "The least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by **both** of the numbers.  \nWhen the two numbers are prime, say \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), the reasoning is straightforward:\n\n1. **Prime factorization**  \n   - A prime number has no divisors other than \\(1\\) and itself.  \n   - Therefore the prime\u2011factorization of \\(p\\) is just \\(p\\), and the factorization of \\(q\\) is just \\(q\\).\n\n2. **Common factors**  \n   - Since \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are distinct primes, they share **no** prime factors in common. Their greatest common divisor (GCD) is \\(1\\).\n\n3. **Constructing the LCM**  \n   - The LCM must contain each prime factor at its highest power that appears in either number.  \n   - For \\(p\\) we need the factor \\(p^1\\); for \\(q\\) we need the factor \\(q^1\\).  \n   - Because there is no overlap, we simply multiply the two distinct prime factors:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(p,q)=p \\times q.\n\\]\n\n4. **Verification with the relation between GCD and LCM**  \n   - In general, for any positive integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\),\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(a,b)\\times\\text{GCD}(a,b)=a\\times b.\n\\]\n\n   - Here \\(\\text{GCD}(p,q)=1\\), so  \n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(p,q)=\\frac{p\\times q}{1}=p\\,q.\n\\]\n\nThus, because two distinct primes share no common divisor other than 1, the smallest number that is a multiple of both of them must contain each prime factor exactly once\u2014hence the LCM equals their product."

By dividing the product of the numbers by the GCF, we \u201ccancel out\u201d the duplicated common factors, leaving only the necessary factors to cover both numbers once each. This yields the smallest number that is a multiple of both\u2014i.e., the LCM. Using the GCF thus provides a quick, reliable shortcut instead of listing multiples or multiplying all prime factors repeatedly."
