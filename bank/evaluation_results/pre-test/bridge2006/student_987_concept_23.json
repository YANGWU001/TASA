  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of LCM and its relationship to the product of two numbers, particularly in the context of coprime numbers. However, there are significant misconceptions, especially regarding the definitions and calculations of LCM. The student confuses LCM with GCD and struggles to apply the concepts accurately in various scenarios.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of two numbers is equal to their product when the numbers don\u2019t share any common factors except\u202f1.  In other words, when they\u2019re \u201crelatively prime\u201d (or coprime).  \n\nBecause the least common multiple has to contain every prime factor that appears in either number, if there\u2019s no overlap you have to multiply all the prime factors together.  That just ends up being the same as multiplying the two numbers themselves, so the LCM =\u202fproduct.  \n\nIf the numbers do share a factor, then the LCM is smaller than the product because the common factor doesn\u2019t have to be counted twice.  (\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure why sometimes it still works even if they have a common factor, but I think that\u2019s when one of the numbers is a factor of the other.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of\u202f4\u202fand\u202f6\u202fis\u202f24. Since 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f24, the LCM is the same as their product."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t think 3 and 12 could work.  If the two numbers were 3 and 12, the LCM would be 12\u202f\u2014\u202for at least that\u2019s what I think \u2013 but the product of 3 and 12 is 36, which seems too big compared to the LCM.  Usually the product should be smaller than the LCM, right?  So I guess the numbers can\u2019t be 3 and 12.  (I\u2019m probably mixing things up, but that\u2019s what I get.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of\u202f9\u202fand\u202f15 is 135, which is actually the same as their product (9\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f135).  \n\nI guess because both numbers go into 135 evenly, that must be the smallest number they both share, so it should be the least common multiple.  \n\nSo yeah, the LCM and the product are the same in this case."

So the LCM and the product don\u2019t match.  \n\n(I\u2019m a little confused about why the LCM would be 12, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "question": "Provide an example of two numbers whose LCM is equal to their product and explain why this is the case.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a simple example could be the numbers **4 and 8**.  \n\nThe product of the two numbers is  \n\\(4 \\times 8 = 32\\).\n\nTo find the LCM, I guess we look for the smallest multiple that both numbers share. Since 8 goes into 32 exactly four times and 4 goes into 32 exactly eight times, the LCM would also be **32**.  \n\nSo in this case the LCM (32) is equal to the product (32).  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure why this works, but I think it\u2019s because both numbers share the same set of factors, and when you multiply them you end up with a number that\u2019s already a common multiple of each."

      "question": "Is it always true that the LCM of two numbers is their product? Provide reasoning with an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of two numbers is actually just their product. Like, if you take 3 and\u202f5, the product is 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f15, and the least common multiple is also 15, so they\u2019re the same. Because the LCM has to be a multiple of both numbers, it seems like you always end up with the product. So, yeah, I\u2019d say the LCM is always the product of the two numbers."

      "student_answer": "Um... I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a pair like **3 and 5** works.  \n\nThe product of 3 and 5 is  \n\\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\).\n\nTo find the LCM, I listed the multiples:  \n\n- Multiples of 3: 3,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f12,\u202f15,\u202f18,\u202f\u2026  \n- Multiples of 5: 5,\u202f10,\u202f15,\u202f20,\u202f\u2026  \n\nThe smallest common multiple I see is 15, so the LCM is 15.\n\nSince 15 (the LCM) is\u2026 well, I guess it\u2019s **less than** 15 (the product)\u2026?  \nSo I think the LCM is less than the product for these numbers.  \n\nI\u2019m not really confident about the \u201cless than\u201d part, but that\u2019s how I figured it out."

      "question": "Why is the LCM of 10 and 15 not equal to their product? Show the calculation process.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the LCM of 10 and 15 isn\u2019t the same as their product is because you have to do some extra step after multiplying them.  \n\nFirst I tried to find the product:  \n\n\\(10 \\times 15 = 150.\\)  \n\nThen I thought maybe we have to divide by the common factor that the two numbers share. Both 10 and 15 are divisible by 5, so I divided the product by 5:  \n\n\\(150 \\div 5 = 30.\\)  \n\nBut then I realized that 30 is actually the *greatest common divisor* (GCD) of the two numbers, not the LCM. So I tried another step: multiply the result by the GCD again:  \n\n\\(30 \\times 5 = 150.\\)  \n\nThat gave me back the original product, which seems confusing.  \n\nSo, in the end, I think the LCM ends up being the same as the product, 150, because after all the dividing and multiplying it just cancels out.  \n\nTherefore, the LCM of 10 and 15 is 150, which is equal to their product. (I\u2019m not totally sure why we do the extra steps, but that\u2019s how I got it.)"
