      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into\u202f16\u202fidentical smaller squares, the layout is a 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 grid.  \n**So there are 4 rows and 4 columns of the smaller squares.**"

      "question": "A square is divided into 25 equal parts. How many parts are in each row?",
      "student_answer": "Each row contains **5** parts. (Since \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\), the square is arranged in a 5\u2011by\u20115 grid.)"

      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is split into more equal sections, each piece must occupy a smaller portion of the whole.  \nIn other words, as the number of equal parts increases, the size (area) of each individual part gets smaller."

      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013 a square can be divided into congruent (equal\u2011shaped and equal\u2011sized) triangles.  \nThe simplest way is to draw one of the square\u2019s diagonals. The diagonal splits the square into two right\u2011isosceles triangles that are mirror images of one another; each has exactly half the area of the original square, the same side lengths, and the same angles, so they are equal.\n\nYou can also get four equal triangles by drawing **both** diagonals. The two diagonals intersect at the centre of the square and produce four right\u2011isosceles triangles, all identical to one another.\n\nIn general a square can be tiled by an even number of congruent triangles (2,\u202f4,\u202f8,\u202f16, \u2026), because each triangle must have an area that is the square\u2019s area divided by an integer, and the geometry works out only when the number of triangles is even. An odd number of identical triangles cannot fill a square without gaps or overlaps.\n\nSo a square **can** be divided into equal triangles; the division is possible whenever you use an even number of congruent triangles, with the diagonal(s) providing the most common examples."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "The 36 equal parts must form a \\(6 \\times 6\\) grid (since \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\)).  \n\nSo each small square\u2019s side length is the original side length divided by 6:\n\n\\[\n\\text{side of small square}= \\frac{12}{6}=2.\n\\]\n\n**Answer:\u202f2 units**."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When we cut a square into several *equal* rectangles, each piece must have the same dimensions as every other piece.  \nA rectangle is defined by two side lengths,\u202f\\(w\\) (width) and\u202f\\(h\\) (height). For a shape to be a **square**, those two lengths must be equal:\u202f\\(w = h\\).\n\nA square that we start with has side length\u202f\\(S\\).  \nIf we cut it into, say, \\(n\\) equal rectangles, the cuts will partition the original side \\(S\\) into smaller segments.  \nFor example, if we slice the square into three equal vertical strips, each strip will have:\n\n* width\u202f\\(w = S/3\\)  \n* height\u202f\\(h = S\\)\n\nThus each piece has dimensions \\(S/3 \\times S\\). Because \\(S/3 \\neq S\\), the width and height are different, so the piece is a rectangle, not a square.\n\nThe same reasoning holds for any number of equal rectangles, whether the cuts are vertical, horizontal, or a combination of both. The only way the resulting pieces could also be squares is if the cut divides the original side into segments that are the same length as the other side\u2014i.e., the segment length would have to equal \\(S\\) itself. That would mean we made no cut at all, leaving just the original square.\n\n**In short:**  \n- A square requires equal side lengths.  \n- Dividing a square into equal rectangles forces each piece to have one side equal to the original square\u2019s side and the other side equal to a fraction of it.  \n- Because those two side lengths are different, each piece is a rectangle, not a square."
