      "question": "Describe how you would divide a circle into 5 equal sections.",
      "student_answer": "To divide a circle into five equal parts you need five central angles that are each \\( \\frac{360^\\circ}{5}=72^\\circ \\).  \nHere\u2019s a simple step\u2011by\u2011step way to do it with a ruler, compass, and protractor (or with the same logic using a straight\u2011edge and compass only).\n\n1. **Draw the circle and its centre**  \n   - Use a compass to draw a circle and mark its centre\u202f\\(O\\).\n\n2. **Create a reference radius**  \n   - Draw any radius from \\(O\\) to the circumference; call the point where it meets the circle \\(A\\).\n\n3. **Mark the first 72\u00b0 angle**  \n   - Place the protractor\u2019s centre on \\(O\\) and align the 0\u00b0 mark with line \\(OA\\).  \n   - Make a small mark on the circle at the 72\u00b0 position. Call that point \\(B\\).\n\n4. **Repeat the 72\u00b0 step**  \n   - Without moving the protractor, rotate it so that 0\u00b0 now aligns with line \\(OB\\).  \n   - Mark the next 72\u00b0 point on the circumference; call it \\(C\\).\n\n5. **Continue until you have five points**  \n   - Repeat the same process from \\(C\\) \u2192 \\(D\\), \\(D\\) \u2192 \\(E\\), and finally \\(E\\) \u2192 back to the original point \\(A\\).  \n   - You should obtain points \\(A, B, C, D, E\\) equally spaced around the circle.\n\n6. **Draw the dividing lines**  \n   - Connect the centre \\(O\\) to each of the five points \\(A, B, C, D, E\\) with straight lines.  \n   - The five radii \\(OA, OB, OC, OD, OE\\) split the circle into five congruent sectors, each having a central angle of 72\u00b0.\n\n---\n\n### Alternative (pure compass\u2011only) construction  \nIf you don\u2019t have a protractor, you can get the same five points by constructing a regular pentagon inside the circle:\n\n1. With the compass set to the radius of the circle, draw an arc from point \\(A\\) that cuts the circumference; the intersection will be point \\(B\\).  \n2. Without changing the compass width, place the compass on \\(B\\) and swing an arc that meets the circle at \\(C\\).  \n3. Continue this \u201cstep\u2011size\u2011equal\u2011to\u2011radius\u201d walk around the circle; after four steps you\u2019ll return to the starting point, giving the five vertices \\(A, B, C, D, E\\).  \n4. Join each vertex to the centre \\(O\\) as before.\n\nEither method yields five equal divisions of the circle."

      "student_answer": "**How to divide a circle into equal sections**\n\n1. **Know the total angle of a circle** \u2013 A full circle measures **360\u00b0**.\n\n2. **Decide how many equal parts you need** \u2013 Let this number be *n*.\n\n3. **Find the central angle for each part**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Angle per part} = \\frac{360\u00b0}{n}\n   \\]\n   This is the angle that will be measured at the centre of the circle between two successive dividing lines (radii).\n\n4. **Draw the first radius** \u2013 Start from the centre of the circle to any point on the circumference. This will be your reference line (often taken as the \u201c0\u00b0\u201d or \u201c12\u2011o\u2019clock\u201d line).\n\n5. **Mark the angles** \u2013 Using a protractor (or a compass\u2011and\u2011ruler construction):\n   - Place the protractor\u2019s centre at the circle\u2019s centre, aligning its zero\u2011line with the first radius.  \n   - Measure the angle you just calculated and draw a second radius at that mark.\n   - Continue moving around the circle, always measuring the same angle from the most recently drawn radius, until you return to the starting line.  \n\n   After *n* steps you will have *n* equally spaced radii, thus dividing the circle into *n* equal sectors.\n\n6. **Check your work** \u2013 The sum of all central angles should be 360\u00b0. If you end up with a small gap or overlap, adjust the marks slightly (this is often due to rounding or manual measurement error).\n\n---\n\n### Example: Dividing a circle into **9 equal parts**\n\n1. **Number of divisions**: \\(n = 9\\)\n\n2. **Compute the central angle**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Angle per part} = \\frac{360\u00b0}{9} = 40\u00b0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Procedure**  \n   - Draw the first radius (your reference line).  \n   - From the centre, measure 40\u00b0 with a protractor and draw the second radius.  \n   - Continue measuring 40\u00b0 from each newly drawn radius: 80\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 160\u00b0, 200\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 280\u00b0, 320\u00b0, and finally back to 360\u00b0 (which coincides with the first line).\n\n4. **Result**  \n   You will have **9 radii** spaced **40\u00b0** apart, creating **9 equal sectors** of the circle. Each sector\u2019s area is \\(\\frac{1}{9}\\) of the whole circle, and each central angle is **40 degrees**."
