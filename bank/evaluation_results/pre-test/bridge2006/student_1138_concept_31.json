      "student_answer": "**How to find the number of equal divisions created by 4 vertical bars inside a rectangle**\n\n1. **Start with the whole rectangle** \u2013 Imagine the rectangle as a single, undivided shape.\n\n2. **Place the vertical bars** \u2013 Insert the four bars so that they are **parallel to each other and to the sides of the rectangle**.  \n   - If you want the divisions to be equal, the distance between any two successive bars (and between a bar and the nearest side of the rectangle) must be the same.\n\n3. **Count the spaces** \u2013 The bars act as \u201cwalls\u201d that separate the rectangle into separate vertical strips.  \n   - The space **to the left of the first bar** is one strip.  \n   - Each gap **between two adjacent bars** is another strip.  \n   - The space **to the right of the last bar** is the final strip.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of strips**:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of equal divisions} = \\text{Number of bars} + 1\n\\]\n\n   - With **4 vertical bars** this gives  \n\n\\[\n4 + 1 = 5 \\text{ equal vertical divisions}.\n\\]\n\n5. **Verify the equality** \u2013 To be sure the divisions are truly equal, you can measure the width of any one strip (for example, using a ruler or the grid on your drawing surface). All five strips should have exactly the same width. If they do not, adjust the positions of the bars until the widths match.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Summary\n- **Place 4 vertical bars equally spaced.**  \n- **Count the gaps:** left of first bar, three gaps between bars, right of last bar.  \n- **Result:** 5 equal vertical sections (bars\u202f+\u202f1)."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain why placing 6 vertical bars in a rectangle results in 7 equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "When you draw vertical bars inside a rectangle, each bar creates a new \u201cborder\u201d that separates one part of the rectangle from the next.  \n\n* With **no** bars the whole rectangle is just **one** region.  \n* Adding the **first** vertical bar splits that one region into **two** parts \u2013 one on the left of the bar and one on the right.  \n* Each additional bar adds exactly **one more** region, because it creates a new space on one side of the bar while leaving the existing spaces unchanged.\n\nTherefore, after placing **6** equally\u2011spaced vertical bars you have:\n\n\\[\n\\text{initial region} + \\text{6 new bars} = 1 + 6 = 7 \\text{ regions}\n\\]\n\nSince the bars are spaced evenly, each of the seven regions has the same width, so they are **seven equal divisions** of the rectangle."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How does the number of vertical bars relate to the total number of equal divisions in a given shape?",
      "student_answer": "The vertical bars are the visual \u201ccuts\u2019\u2019 that split the shape into equal parts.  \nWhen the bars are drawn **inside** the shape, each bar creates a new boundary between two adjacent parts. Therefore the total number of equal divisions is always **one more than the number of vertical bars** that are drawn.\n\n**Formula**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of equal divisions} = \\text{Number of vertical bars} + 1\n\\]\n\n**Why?**  \n- With **0** bars the shape is a single undivided region \u2192 1 division.  \n- Adding **1** bar splits the shape into two regions \u2192 2 divisions.  \n- Adding **2** bars creates three separate regions \u2192 3 divisions, and so on.\n\n**Example**  \nIf you draw 4 equally spaced vertical bars across a rectangle, the rectangle is divided into 5 equal vertical strips.\n\nSo, to find how many equal parts a shape has, simply count the vertical bars and add one."

      "question": "Illustrate with an example how placing 10 vertical bars in a square creates multiple equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "**Example**\n\nImagine a plain square that is 10\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202fcm.  \nNow draw **10 vertical bars** inside the square, spacing them **evenly** from the left edge to the right edge.\n\nBecause the bars are equally spaced, the distance between any two neighboring bars (or between a bar and the nearest edge) is the same:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Width of each strip}= \\frac{\\text{total width}}{\\text{number of strips}}=\n\\frac{10\\ \\text{cm}}{10+1}= \\frac{10}{11}\\ \\text{cm}\\approx0.91\\ \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\nThe 10 bars therefore create **11 vertical strips**, each exactly \\( \\frac{10}{11}\\)\u202fcm wide.  \n\nIf you now add, say, **4 horizontal bars** that are also equally spaced, you\u2019ll get\n\n* 5 horizontal strips (each \\( \\frac{10}{5}=2\\)\u202fcm high), and  \n* 11 vertical strips (each \\( \\frac{10}{11}\\)\u202fcm wide).\n\nThe combination of the vertical and horizontal bars divides the original square into  \n\n\\[\n5 \\times 11 = 55\n\\]\n\n**equal rectangles**, each measuring \\( \\frac{10}{11}\\)\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fcm.\n\n---\n\n### What the example shows\n\n* **One set of 10 vertical bars** alone splits the square into many **equal vertical divisions** (11 of them).  \n* Adding another set of evenly\u2011spaced horizontal bars multiplies the effect, creating a grid of many **equal small regions** (55 in the example).  \n\nThus, placing 10 vertical bars in a square is a simple way to generate multiple equal divisions, and the principle extends naturally when additional equally\u2011spaced bars are added in other directions."
