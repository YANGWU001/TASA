      "question": "Explain why the LCM of two numbers is sometimes equal to their product.",
      "student_answer": "The **least common multiple (LCM)** of two integers is the smallest positive number that both of them divide into.  \nIn general the LCM is related to the product and the greatest common divisor (GCD) by  \n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(a,b)\\;=\\;\\frac{a\\;b}{\\gcd(a,b)} .\n\\]\n\nBecause of this formula, the LCM will be **equal to the product** \\(a\\;b\\) exactly when the denominator \\(\\gcd(a,b)\\) is 1.  In other words, when the two numbers have no common factor other than 1 \u2013 they are *relatively prime* (or \u201ccoprime\u201d).  \n\nSo if, for example, \\(a=4\\) and \\(b=9\\) (they share no factor except 1), then  \n\n\\[\n\\gcd(4,9)=1 \\qquad\\Longrightarrow\\qquad \n\\text{LCM}(4,9)=\\frac{4\\cdot 9}{1}=36,\n\\]\n\nwhich is just the product 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f9.  \n\nI think the same idea works for any pair of numbers that are \u201cindependent\u201d in the sense that they don\u2019t share a prime factor.  When they do share a factor, the GCD is larger than\u202f1, so the fraction \\(\\frac{ab}{\\gcd(a,b)}\\) becomes smaller than the product, and the LCM is no longer equal to the product.  \n\n(So the LCM is sometimes the product, specifically when the numbers are relatively prime.)"

      "student_answer": "The least common multiple of 4 and\u202f6 is 12.  \n\nThe product of the two numbers is \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\).  \n\nSo the LCM is **not** equal to their product (the LCM\u202f=\u202f12, the product\u202f=\u202f24)."

      "question": "If the LCM of two numbers is 12 and their product is 36, could these numbers be 3 and 12? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "No, the numbers could not be 3 and\u202f12.  \n\nThe least common multiple of 3 and 12 is not 12; it is actually 6, because the two numbers share the factor 3 and the smallest number that each divides into is 6. Since the LCM is supposed to be 12, the pair 3 and\u202f12 does not satisfy the condition. Also, the product of 3 and\u202f12 is 36, which matches the given product, but because the LCM requirement fails, the pair cannot be the numbers we\u2019re looking for."

      "student_answer": "The least common multiple of 7 and\u202f5 is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(7,5)=7 \\times 5 = 35.\n\\]\n\nThe product of the two numbers is also  \n\n\\[\n7 \\times 5 = 35.\n\\]\n\nSo, **the LCM does match the product**. This happens because 7 and 5 share no common factors other than 1 (they are relatively prime). When two numbers have no common divisors greater than 1, the smallest number that is a multiple of both of them is just their product."

      "student_answer": "I think a simple example would be the numbers **4 and\u202f5**.\n\n- The prime factorization of 4 is \\(2^2\\).\n- The prime factorization of 5 is \\(5\\).\n\nSince the two numbers have no common prime factors (they are relatively\u202fprime), the least common multiple is just the product of the highest powers of all primes that appear:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(4,5)=2^2 \\times 5 = 20.\n\\]\n\nAnd the product of the numbers is also\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 5 = 20.\n\\]\n\nSo, because 4 and\u202f5 share no common factors, their LCM equals their product.

      "question": "Is it always true that the LCM of two numbers is their product? Provide reasoning with an example.",
      "student_answer": "No \u2013 the least\u2011common multiple of two numbers is only equal to their product when the numbers have no common factors (i.e., they are relatively prime).  \n\n**Reasoning**  \nIf the two numbers share a common factor, that factor is counted twice in the product, so the LCM will be smaller than the product. The LCM is the smallest number that contains each prime factor the greatest number of times it appears in either of the original numbers.\n\n**Example**  \nTake 4 and\u202f6.  \n- Their product is \\(4\\times6 = 24\\).  \n- The prime factorizations are \\(4 = 2^2\\) and \\(6 = 2\\cdot3\\).  \n- The LCM must contain \\(2^2\\) (the highest power of 2) and \\(3\\) (the highest power of 3), so \\(\\text{LCM}(4,6) = 2^2 \\cdot 3 = 12\\).\n\nThus the LCM (12) is not the product (24). Only when the numbers share no common prime factors (e.g., 5 and\u202f7) does the LCM equal the product."

      "question": "Find two numbers where the LCM is less than their product. Explain how you determined this.",
      "student_answer": "One easy way to get the LCM smaller than the product is to choose two numbers that share a factor greater than\u202f1 (so their greatest common divisor is not 1).\n\n**Example:** 4 and\u202f6  \n\n- **Product:**\u202f\\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\)  \n- **Greatest common divisor (GCD):**\u202f\\(\\gcd(4,6)=2\\)  \n- **Least common multiple (LCM):**  \n  Because \\(\\text{LCM}(a,b) \\times \\text{GCD}(a,b) = a \\times b\\), we have  \n  \\(\\text{LCM}(4,6) = \\dfrac{4 \\times 6}{\\gcd(4,6)} = \\dfrac{24}{2} = 12\\).\n\nSince \\(12 < 24\\), the LCM (12) is indeed less than the product (24).\n\n**Why this works:** Whenever two numbers share a common factor (i.e., \\(\\gcd > 1\\)), the product is \u201csplit\u201d between the LCM and the GCD, making the LCM smaller than the product. If the numbers were relatively prime (\\(\\gcd = 1\\)), the LCM would equal the product."

      "question": "Why is the LCM of 10 and 15 not equal to their product? Show the calculation process.",
      "student_answer": "I think the reason the LCM of 10 and 15 isn\u2019t just their product is because the two numbers share a common factor, so we have to \u201ccancel\u201d that factor when we look for the smallest common multiple.\n\nFirst, the product of 10 and 15 is  \n\n\\[\n10 \\times 15 = 150 .\n\\]\n\nIf the numbers had no common factors (i.e., they were relatively prime) the LCM would indeed be 150. But 10 and 15 are not relatively prime; they both share the factor **5**.\n\nThe greatest common divisor (GCD) of 10 and 15 is 5 (I\u2019m pretty sure about that).  \nTo get the LCM we take the product and divide by the GCD:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM} = \\frac{10 \\times 15}{\\text{GCD}(10,15)} = \\frac{150}{5} = 30 .\n\\]\n\nSo the LCM is 30, not 150.  \n\nIn short, because 10 and 15 have a common factor (5), the LCM is the product divided by that factor, which makes it much smaller than the full product."
