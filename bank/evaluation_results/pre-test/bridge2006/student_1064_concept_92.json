  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of whole number lower bounds, correctly identifying them in various contexts and providing clear explanations. The only incorrect answer was for Question 4, where the student mistakenly identified the lower bound of a negative number. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the topic.",

      "student_answer": "A **whole\u2011number lower bound** is the smallest whole number (i.e., a non\u2011negative integer) that is guaranteed to be less than or equal to the exact value of a quantity we\u2019re estimating or measuring.\n\nIn other words, if we don\u2019t know the precise number but we can be sure that the true value can\u2019t be smaller than a certain whole number, that whole number is the lower bound. It \u201cbounds\u201d the value from below, ensuring the actual amount is at least that big (or possibly larger).\n\n**Example:**  \nSuppose a jar contains \u201cmore than 47 marbles.\u201d We may not know the exact count, but we can confidently say that the number of marbles is at least 48. Here, 48 is a whole\u2011number lower bound for the marble count.\n\nThe concept is useful when we need a safe, conservative estimate that will never underestimate the true quantity."

      "question": "What role does rounding play when determining the whole number lower bound of a number?",
      "student_answer": "Rounding is the tool we use to \u201csnap\u201d a non\u2011integer number to the nearest whole number that does not exceed it.  \nWhen we need the whole\u2011number lower bound of a value, we round the value **down** (i.e., we take the floor). This process guarantees that the resulting integer is the greatest whole number that is still less than or equal to the original number, which is exactly what the lower bound requires."
