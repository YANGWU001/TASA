      "question": "Explain why adding a negative integer is equivalent to subtraction.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think adding a negative integer works kind of like subtraction because you\u2019re basically \u201ctaking away\u201d something.  \n\nWhen you add a negative number, say\u202f+\u202f(\u20115), you\u2019re actually moving to the left on the number line, which feels the same as subtracting 5. So\u202f3\u202f+\u202f(\u20115) would be the same as\u202f3\u202f\u2011\u202f5\u202f=\u202f\u20112.  \n\nI guess the idea is that a negative sign in front of a number tells you to do the opposite operation, so instead of adding the value you add the \u201copposite\u201d of it, which ends up being subtraction.  \n\nSo, basically, adding a negative is just another way of saying \u201csubtract that positive amount.\u201d  \n\n(I'm not totally sure; this is how I understand it right now.)"

      "question": "What is the difference between adding a negative integer and subtracting a positive integer?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there\u2019s actually a difference. Adding a negative integer makes the whole thing get *smaller* (more negative), while subtracting a positive integer makes the number go *up* (more positive). So they don\u2019t do the same thing \u2013 one pushes the value down and the other pushes it up."
