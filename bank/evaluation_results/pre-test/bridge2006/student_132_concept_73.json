      "question": "How would you divide a number line to represent fractions with a denominator of 10?",
      "student_answer": "To show fractions that have a denominator of\u202f10, you split the unit segment of the number line into **10 equal parts**.\n\n1. **Draw the basic number line** with endpoints labeled\u202f0 (at the left) and\u202f1 (at the right).  \n2. **Divide the segment from 0 to 1 into 10 equal intervals**.  \n   - Each interval has length \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) (one\u2011tenth).  \n3. **Mark the division points** and label them with the corresponding fractions:  \n\n\\[\n0,\\ \\frac{1}{10},\\ \\frac{2}{10},\\ \\frac{3}{10},\\ \\frac{4}{10},\\ \\frac{5}{10},\\ \\frac{6}{10},\\ \\frac{7}{10},\\ \\frac{8}{10},\\ \\frac{9}{10},\\ 1\n\\]\n\n(You can also simplify the fractions if desired, e.g., \\(\\frac{5}{10}= \\frac{1}{2}\\).)\n\nNow any fraction with denominator\u202f10 can be located by counting the appropriate number of tenth\u2011segments from 0 toward 1."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain how the denominator of a fraction affects the number of divisions on a number line.",
      "student_answer": "The denominator tells you **how many equal pieces the whole unit (the segment from\u202f0\u202fto\u202f1) must be broken into**.  \n\n- If the denominator is\u202f2, you split the segment into\u202f2 equal parts (\u00bd\u2011steps).  \n- If the denominator is\u202f4, you split it into\u202f4 equal parts (\u00bc\u2011steps).  \n- If the denominator is\u202f8, you split it into\u202f8 equal parts (\u215b\u2011steps), and so on.\n\nSo the larger the denominator, the **greater the number of divisions** you need to draw, and the shorter the distance between each tick mark. The numerator then tells you which of those equally\u2011spaced marks to shade or label (e.g.,\u202f3\u20448 means count three of the eight marks from\u202f0).  \n\nIn short, the denominator determines the spacing of the grid on the number line: a bigger denominator \u2192 more, finer divisions; a smaller denominator \u2192 fewer, coarser divisions. (The denominator does not change the length of the whole number\u2011line segment\u2014it only changes how finely that length is divided.)"

      "student_answer": "The denominator tells you how many equal pieces the unit segment (the distance from\u202f0\u202fto\u202f1) is split into on a number line.\u202fIn other words, if the denominator is 5, the line from\u202f0\u202fto\u202f1 is divided into 5 equal parts, each of length\u202f1\u20445.\u202fTo locate a fraction\u202f\\( \\frac{n}{d} \\)\u202fyou simply count\u202f\\(n\\)\u202fof those equal divisions from\u202f0.  \n\n(One small detail that\u2019s easy to mix up: the denominator gives the number of **intervals**, not the total number of tick\u2011marks\u2014including the endpoints\u2014on the line.)"

      "question": "How could you divide a number line to represent fractions with denominators of both 2 and 4?",
      "student_answer": "To show both\u202f\u00bd\u2011intervals and\u202f\u00bc\u2011intervals on the same number line you can start with the standard 0\u2011to\u20111 segment and then:\n\n1. **Divide the whole segment into 2 equal parts.**  \n   - Mark the midpoint.  \n   - The points you now have are\u202f0,\u202f\u00bd,\u202f1.  \n   - These give the fractions with denominator\u202f2 (e.g.,\u202f\u00bd).\n\n2. **Divide each of those halves into 2 more equal parts** (i.e., split the whole line into 4 equal parts).  \n   - Mark the quarters:\u202f\u00bc,\u202f\u00be.  \n   - The complete set of points is\u202f0,\u202f\u00bc,\u202f\u00bd,\u202f\u00be,\u202f1.\n\nNow the number line has equally\u2011spaced marks at every fourth of the whole unit.  \n- Any point that is two marks apart (0\u202f\u2192\u202f\u00bd, \u00bd\u202f\u2192\u202f1) represents a fraction with denominator\u202f2.  \n- Any single\u2011mark step (0\u202f\u2192\u202f\u00bc, \u00bc\u202f\u2192\u202f\u00bd, \u2026) represents a fraction with denominator\u202f4.\n\nSo by first halving the line and then halving each half again (or, equivalently, directly dividing the line into 4 equal parts), you get a number line that simultaneously displays fractions with denominators\u202f2 **and**\u202f4."
