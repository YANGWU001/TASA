      "question": "What does the number line look like when marking the second positive integer as a sum?",
      "student_answer": "When you want to show the **second positive integer** on a number line as a **sum**, you basically break the total distance into two \u201csteps\u2019\u2019 that add up to the number you\u2019re interested in.  \n\nHere\u2019s a typical way to draw it:\n\n1. **Draw a horizontal line** and put a tick\u2011mark at\u202f0 (the origin).  \n2. **Choose the integer you want to represent** \u2013 let\u2019s say it\u2019s\u202f5.  \n3. **Pick a first addend** (any positive integer smaller than\u202f5).  A common choice is the \u201cfirst positive integer\u2019\u2019 you already have on the line, e.g.,\u202f2.  \n4. **Mark the first addend**: from\u202f0 count two units to the right and put a tick\u2011mark at\u202f2.  Label it \u201c2\u201d.  \n5. **Add the second addend**: now count the remaining units (5\u202f\u2013\u202f2\u202f=\u202f3) to the right of the 2\u2011mark and put another tick\u2011mark at\u202f5.  Label the segment from\u202f2\u202fto\u202f5 as \u201c3\u201d.  \n6. **Show the sum**: you can draw an arrow or a bracket from\u202f0\u202fto\u202f5 and write \u201c2\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f5\u201d underneath the line.\n\nThe picture ends up looking something like this (rough sketch):\n\n```\n0 \u2500\u2500\u25ba\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25ba\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25ba\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25ba\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25ba\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25ba\u2500\u2500\u25ba\u2500\u2500\u25ba\n|   1   2   3   4   5\n          ^---3---^\n      ^---2---^\n```\n\n- The **first positive integer** (2) is the first jump from 0.  \n- The **second positive integer** is the **sum** of the two jumps: you moved 2 units, then 3 more units, ending at 5.  \n\nIf you pick a different first addend, the picture changes accordingly \u2013 e.g., if you start with 1, you\u2019d mark 1, then 4 more units to get to 5, and write \u201c1\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f5\u201d.  \n\nSo the number line essentially shows the second integer (the total) as the endpoint of the combined jumps, and the two jumps themselves illustrate the two addends that sum to that integer."

In fact, any integer\u202f\\(n\\) can be expressed as the sum of a negative integer and a positive integer (just pick a negative\u202f\\(-k\\) and then add \\(n+k\\), which will be positive as long as \\(k\\) is chosen small enough).  \n\nTherefore, the answer is **yes** \u2013 2 can be expressed as a sum of a negative and a positive integer."

      "student_answer": "To check that the second positive integer is really being shown as a sum on the line\u2011number diagram you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the point for the integer.**  \n   First locate the point that is labeled with the second positive integer (for example,\u202f5).  It should sit on the tick that is exactly 5\u2011units to the right of the origin (0).\n\n2. **Mark the two addends.**  \n   On the same line draw two smaller \u201csteps\u2019\u2019 that start at 0, end at the first addend, and then continue from that point to the second add\u2011end.  For 5 = 2\u202f+\u202f3 you would put a mark at 2 and another mark 3 units further to the right, landing at 5.\n\n3. **Count the unit\u2011segments.**  \n   Count the little unit\u2011segments from 0 to the first mark (that should be the first addend) and then from the first mark to the final point (that should be the second addend).  The total number of unit\u2011segments you\u2019ve counted should be the same as the coordinate of the final point.\n\n4. **Check the arithmetic.**  \n   Add the two numbers you just counted.  If the sum equals the label on the final point, the representation is correct.  In the example, 2\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f5, which matches the label.\n\n5. **Look for consistency.**  \n   All other numbers on the line should follow the same rule \u2013 each point can be reached by adding the lengths of the segments that lead up to it.  If any point fails this test, the diagram is wrong.\n\nIf you do these steps and the distances line up, you have verified that the second positive integer is indeed being shown as a sum on the number line."
