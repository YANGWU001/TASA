Therefore any common factor of the two numbers must be **\\(\\le a\\)**.\n\n3. **The greatest common factor is the biggest among the common factors**  \n   Since we have already identified that \\(a\\) itself is a common factor, and no common factor can exceed \\(a\\), the biggest possible common factor is exactly \\(a\\).\n\nPutting these facts together, the **Greatest Common Factor (GCF)** of \\(a\\) and its multiple \\(b\\) is the smaller number \\(a\\).\n\n---\n\n### Quick example\nTake \\(a = 8\\). Its multiple could be \\(b = 3 \\times 8 = 24\\).\n\n- Common factors of 8 and 24: \\(1, 2, 4, 8\\).  \n- The largest of these is \\(8\\), which is the smaller of the two original numbers.\n\nThus, the GCF of a number and any of its multiples is always the smaller number."

      "student_answer": "If one of the two numbers is an exact multiple of the other, the greatest common factor (GCF) is simply the smaller number.  \n\n**Why this works**\n\n- Let the two numbers be \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(a<b\\).\n- If \\(b\\) is a multiple of \\(a\\), then \\(b = k\\;a\\) for some integer \\(k\\).\n- Every divisor of \\(a\\) also divides \\(b\\) (because \\(b = k\\;a\\)).\n- Therefore the set of common divisors of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is exactly the set of divisors of \\(a\\).\n- The largest element of that set is \\(a\\) itself, so \\(\\text{GCF}(a,b)=a\\).\n\n**How to determine it without full factorization**\n\n1. **Identify the smaller number** \u2013 call it \\(a\\).\n2. **Check if the larger number \\(b\\) is divisible by \\(a\\)** (just perform the division \\(b \\div a\\) or use modular arithmetic: see if \\(b \\bmod a = 0\\)).\n3. If the remainder is 0, then \\(b\\) is a multiple of \\(a\\) and the GCF is \\(a\\).\n4. If the remainder is not 0, the numbers are not in a simple multiple relationship, and you would need a different method (e.g., Euclidean algorithm).\n\n**Example**\n\nFind the GCF of 12 and 36.\n\n- The smaller number is 12.\n- Compute \\(36 \\div 12 = 3\\) with remainder 0, so 36 is a multiple of 12.\n- Hence \\(\\text{GCF}(12,36) = 12\\).\n\nThus, when one number is a multiple of the other, you can determine the GCF instantly by confirming the divisibility and taking the smaller number as the answer\u2014no need to factor either number fully."

      "question": "Why is the GCF of 7 and 21 equal to 7?",
      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) is the largest whole number that divides **both** numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n**Step\u202f1: List the factors of each number**  \n- Factors of 7:\u20031,\u202f7  \n- Factors of 21:\u20031,\u202f3,\u202f7,\u202f21  \n\n**Step\u202f2: Find the common factors**  \nThe numbers that appear in both lists are **1** and **7**.\n\n**Step\u202f3: Choose the greatest one**  \nBetween the common factors, 7 is larger than 1, so the greatest common factor is **7**.\n\nAnother way to see it: 21 can be written as \\(21 = 7 \\times 3\\). Since 7 is a factor of 21 and, of course, a factor of itself, the largest number that divides both 7 and 21 is 7. \n\nTherefore, the GCF of 7 and 21 equals **7**."

      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where finding the GCF of a number and its multiple is useful.",
      "student_answer": "A practical situation where you\u2019d want the greatest common factor (GCF) of a number and one of its multiples is when you\u2019re trying to arrange objects into the largest possible equal groups without leftovers.  \n\n**Example \u2013 Packing Gift Boxes**\n\nImagine a small business that makes handcrafted candles. Each candle is sold in a set of 12, but the company receives orders in batches of 48 candles (which is a multiple of 12). The owner wants to pack the candles into the fewest number of identical gift boxes so that every box contains the same number of candles and no candles are left unpacked.\n\n- The two numbers involved are **12 candles per set** (the base number) and **48 candles total** (the multiple).\n- The GCF of 12 and 48 is **12**.\n\nBecause the GCF equals the size of one set, the owner knows the candles can be divided into **4 boxes** each holding **12 candles** (48 \u00f7 12 = 4). This uses the largest possible group size, minimizing the number of boxes needed while keeping each box identical.\n\n**Why the GCF matters:**  \nFinding the GCF tells the business owner the biggest group size that will work for both the product packaging rule (12 per set) and the total quantity on hand (48). This eliminates waste (extra packaging) and simplifies inventory handling.\n\nSimilar scenarios appear in:\n\n- **Floor tiling:** Determining the largest square tile size that will exactly cover a rectangular floor whose dimensions are multiples of each other.  \n- **Event planning:** Splitting a group of participants (e.g., 60 people) into equal teams where each team must have at least a certain number of members (e.g., 15). The GCF of 60 and 15 (which is 15) shows the maximum team size that fits perfectly.  \n\nIn each case, the GCF of a number and its multiple guides us to the most efficient, waste\u2011free way to divide items into equal groups."
