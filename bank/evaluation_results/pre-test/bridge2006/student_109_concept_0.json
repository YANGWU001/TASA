They got 6 points each game for 8 games, which is\u2026 uh\u2026 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f48 points, and Team B got 5 points each game for 10 games, which is\u2026 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f50 points.  Wait, I guess 48 is bigger than 50?  So yeah, Team A must have the higher total."
