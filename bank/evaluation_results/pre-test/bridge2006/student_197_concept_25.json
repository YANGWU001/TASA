However, there are significant misconceptions in the other answers, particularly in the definitions and methods for finding LCM. The student should focus on understanding the concept of LCM and practicing with more examples to improve accuracy.",

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain what the least common multiple represents in mathematical terms.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the least common multiple is kind of the biggest number that both numbers can go into evenly. Like, it\u2019s the largest multiple that the two numbers share, so it\u2019s the highest number that both of them divide without a remainder.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Identify the LCM of 8 and 12, and explain the steps you used to find it.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the LCM of 8 and 12 is... maybe 20?  \n\nI tried to find it by listing multiples.  \n- For 8, I wrote: 8,\u202f16,\u202f24,\u202f32,\u202f40\u2026  \n- For 12, I wrote: 12,\u202f24,\u202f36,\u202f48\u2026  \n\nThen I looked for a number that shows up in both lists. I saw 24 in both, but I thought maybe I missed a smaller one, so I kept going and saw 40 for 8 and 48 for 12. I guessed that 20 could be a common multiple because it\u2019s close to the numbers I wrote, and I thought maybe I made a mistake with the lists.  \n\nSo, my answer is 20, even though I\u2019m not really sure.  (I\u2019m pretty confused about which one is actually the least common multiple.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the other number could be 24.  Since the LCM is 36 and one number is 12, maybe the other one is 24?  (I could be wrong, though.)"

      "question": "How can you use a number line to visually determine the LCM of 2 and 5?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you would draw a number line and mark all the multiples of each number on it. So you\u2019d put marks at 2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f10,\u202f12\u2026 for 2 and at 5,\u202f10,\u202f15\u2026 for 5. Then you look for the first place where the marks line up. Maybe that\u2019s the LCM? \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the first time they line up is at 5\u2026? Or maybe it\u2019s at 2? Honestly, I think the first common spot is probably 5, so that might be the LCM. \n\n(I'm kind of confused, so this might not be exactly right.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Why is the LCM of two prime numbers always equal to their product?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the reason is that prime numbers don\u2019t share any factors except 1, so the smallest number that both can divide into is just the bigger one. Since the bigger prime is already a multiple of the smaller one (because it\u2019s prime), the LCM ends up being the larger prime itself. ...I guess that\u2019s why it\u2019s just the product?  (Sorry if that\u2019s not right.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of 18 and 24 might be 144.  \n\nI guess you can use the GCF to help: first you find the GCF of the two numbers (I think it\u2019s 3?), and then you somehow multiply the numbers together and divide by the GCF. So maybe something like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}= \\frac{18 \\times 24}{\\text{GCF}} \\approx \\frac{432}{3}=144.\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about using the GCF to get the LCM."
