  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of rewriting subtraction of negative integers as addition, particularly in their explanations and examples. However, there were several incorrect calculations, particularly in questions 1, 2, 5, and 10, indicating a need for more practice with arithmetic involving negative numbers.",

      "question": "Explain why subtracting a negative integer is equivalent to adding a positive integer.",
      "student_answer": "Subtracting a negative integer can be thought of as adding its opposite, so the sign \u201cflips\u201d twice.  For example, if you have  \n\n\\[\n5 - (-3)\n\\]\n\nyou\u2019re really taking away a \u201c\u20113\u201d.  Taking away a negative is the same as adding the positive version of that number, because the minus sign in front of the parentheses changes the sign of the number inside.  In other words  \n\n\\[\n5 - (-3) = 5 + 3.\n\\]\n\nThe reason this works is that the subtraction operation is defined as adding the opposite:  \n\n\\[\na - b = a + (-b).\n\\]\n\nIf \\(b\\) itself is already negative (say \\(b = -c\\)), then its opposite is \\(-(-c)\\), which is just \\(c\\).  So  \n\n\\[\na - (-c) = a + c.\n\\]\n\nI think the \u201cdouble\u2011negative\u201d cancels out, kind of like how two minus signs in a row make a plus.  This is why subtracting a negative integer ends up increasing the original number, just like adding a positive integer would.  (Sometimes people get confused and think you have to change the order of the numbers, but you don\u2019t \u2013 you just change the sign of the second term.)"

      "question": "Provide a real-world example where subtracting a negative integer can be rewritten as addition.",
      "student_answer": "A common everyday situation where \u201csubtracting a negative\u201d is the same as adding shows up when you\u2019re talking about temperature changes.\n\nImagine it\u2019s\u202f\u20115\u202f\u00b0C outside this morning and the forecast says the temperature will *increase* by\u202f\u20113\u202f\u00b0C over the next hour.  \nThe phrase \u201cincrease by\u202f\u20113\u202f\u00b0C\u201d really means the temperature will go up\u202f3\u202f\u00b0C, because:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New temperature} = (-5) - (-3) = (-5) + 3 = -2\\;\\text{\u00b0C}.\n\\]\n\nSo \u201csubtracting a negative\u202f\u20113\u202f\u00b0C\u201d is just another way of saying \u201cadd\u202f3\u202f\u00b0C\u201d.
