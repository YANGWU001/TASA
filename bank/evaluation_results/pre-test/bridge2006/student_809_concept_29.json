      "student_answer": "When a number\u202f\\(a\\) is multiplied by an integer\u202f\\(k\\) (with \\(k\\ge 1\\)), the product is a **multiple** of the original number:\n\n\\[\nb = k\\cdot a .\n\\]\n\n**Why the GCF is the smaller number \\(a\\):**\n\n1. **Every divisor of \\(a\\) also divides \\(b\\).**  \n   If \\(d\\) is a divisor of \\(a\\), then \\(a = d\\cdot m\\) for some integer \\(m\\).  \n   Substituting into \\(b\\) gives  \n   \\[\n   b = k\\cdot a = k\\cdot (d\\cdot m) = d\\cdot (k m),\n   \\]\n   so \\(d\\) divides \\(b\\) as well. Hence every factor of the smaller number \\(a\\) is automatically a common factor of both \\(a\\) and its multiple \\(b\\).\n\n2. **No divisor larger than \\(a\\) can divide \\(a\\).**  \n   By definition, a factor of a number cannot be larger than the number itself. Therefore any common factor of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be \\(\\le a\\).\n\n3. **\\(a\\) itself divides both numbers.**  \n   - \\(a\\) obviously divides itself.  \n   - Since \\(b = k\\cdot a\\), \\(a\\) also divides \\(b\\).\n\n4. **Thus \\(a\\) is the greatest among all common factors.**  \n   Because all common factors are \\(\\le a\\) and \\(a\\) is itself a common factor, the greatest common factor (GCF) of \\(a\\) and its multiple \\(b\\) must be \\(a\\).\n\n**Conclusion:** The GCF of a number and any of its multiples is always the smaller number because every divisor of the smaller number divides the larger (multiple) as well, and nothing larger than the smaller number can divide it. Hence the smaller number is the greatest common divisor."

      "question": "How can you determine the GCF of two numbers where one is a multiple of the other without fully factoring both numbers?",
      "student_answer": "If one of the two numbers is an exact multiple of the other, the greatest common factor (GCF) is simply the smaller number\u2014the one that divides the larger.\n\n**Why this works**\n\n- Suppose the numbers are \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and you discover that \\(b = k\\;a\\) for some integer \\(k\\).\n- Every factor of \\(a\\) is automatically a factor of \\(b\\) because multiplying by \\(k\\) does not remove any of \\(a\\)\u2019s prime factors.\n- Consequently, the *largest* number that divides **both** \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is \\(a\\) itself.\n\n**Quick way to see it without full factorization**\n\n1. **Identify the smaller number.**  \n   Compare the two numbers; the smaller one is the candidate for the GCF.\n\n2. **Check if the larger number is a multiple of the smaller.**  \n   Perform a simple division: compute \\( \\frac{\\text{larger}}{\\text{smaller}} \\).  \n   - If the result is an integer (no remainder), the larger number is a multiple of the smaller.\n\n3. **Conclude:**  \n   - If the division yields an integer, the GCF = the smaller number.  \n   - If there is a remainder, the numbers are not in a pure multiple relationship, and you would need another method (e.g., Euclidean algorithm) to find the GCF.\n\n**Example**\n\nFind the GCF of\u202f24 and\u202f96.\n\n- Smaller number:\u202f24.  \n- Divide the larger by the smaller:\u202f\\(96 \u00f7 24 = 4\\) (an integer).  \n- Since 96 = 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f24, 24 divides 96 exactly.  \n\n**Therefore, GCF(24,\u202f96) = 24.**\n\nThis shortcut saves you from having to list all prime factors of each number; you only need to confirm the multiple relationship. If the relationship holds, the answer is immediate."

Identify the common factors**\n\nThe numbers that appear in both lists are\u202f1\u202fand\u202f7.\n\n**3. Choose the greatest (largest) common factor**\n\nBetween the common factors, 7 is larger than 1, so the greatest common factor is **7**.\n\n**Why this makes sense intuitively**\n\nSince 21 is a multiple of 7 (\u202f21\u202f=\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f), any factor of 7 automatically divides 21 as well. The only factors of 7 are 1 and 7, so the biggest one that works for both numbers is 7 itself. Hence, the GCF of 7 and 21 is **7**."

      "question": "If the GCF of two numbers is 20 and one of the numbers is 80, what could the other number be?",
      "student_answer": "Since the greatest common factor is \\(20\\), the other number must be a multiple of \\(20\\).  \nLet the other number be \\(20k\\). For the GCF of \\(80=20\\cdot4\\) and \\(20k\\) to be exactly \\(20\\), the factor \\(k\\) must share no common factor larger than \\(1\\) with \\(4\\); in other words \\(\\gcd(k,4)=1\\).  \n\nSo any odd integer \\(k\\) works. Examples are:\n\n* \\(k=1\\)\u2003\u2192\u2003\\(20\\)  \n* \\(k=3\\)\u2003\u2192\u2003\\(60\\)  \n* \\(k=5\\)\u2003\u2192\u2003\\(100\\)  \n* \\(k=7\\)\u2003\u2192\u2003\\(140\\)  \n\nThus one possible value for the other number is **\\(100\\)** (and any other multiple of\u202f20 whose factor is odd would also be valid)."

      "student_answer": "A practical situation where you need the greatest common factor (GCF) of a number and one of its multiples is when you are planning **uniform packaging or grouping** for a product.\n\n**Scenario \u2013 Packing snack bags for a school event**\n\n- The school orders **540 snack packs** for a field day.\n- The event organizers want to arrange the snack packs into **identical bundles** so that each activity station receives the same number of bundles, and each bundle contains the same number of snack packs.\n- They also want each bundle to hold a **multiple of 12** snack packs because the bags are pre\u2011stacked in groups of 12 (e.g., 12, 24, 36 \u2026).\n\nTo determine the largest possible size of each bundle that satisfies both conditions, they need the **GCF of 540 (the total number of packs) and a multiple of 12**.  \n\nBecause any multiple of 12 can be written as \\(12k\\), the problem reduces to finding the greatest factor that 540 shares with 12.  \n\n\\[\n\\text{GCF}(540,\\;12)=12\n\\]\n\nThus the largest bundle size that works is **12 snack packs per bundle**.  \nThe 540 packs can then be divided into  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{540}{12}=45\\text{ bundles}\n\\]\n\nand each of the 5 activity stations can receive 9 bundles, giving every station the same number of packs without leftovers.\n\n**Why the GCF matters**\n\n- Using a divisor larger than the GCF (e.g., 24) would not divide 540 evenly, leaving extra packs.\n- Using a smaller divisor (e.g., 6) would work, but it would create more, smaller bundles than necessary, increasing handling time.\n\nHence, finding the GCF of a number and its multiple helps the organizers choose the **largest uniform group size** that meets the packaging requirement, minimizing waste and simplifying distribution."
