      "question": "Explain how you can identify a negative integer on a number line.",
      "student_answer": "To locate a negative integer on a number line, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the zero point** \u2013 This is the central mark that separates the positive numbers (to the right) from the negative numbers (to the left).\n\n2. **Look to the left of zero** \u2013 All positions left of zero represent negative values. The farther left you go, the smaller (more negative) the integer becomes.\n\n3. **Count the tick marks** \u2013 Number lines are usually evenly spaced. Starting at zero, count one tick to the left to reach \\(-1\\), two ticks to reach \\(-2\\), and so on. Each tick corresponds to the next integer in the negative direction.\n\n4. **Confirm the label** \u2013 Many number lines label some of the ticks (e.g., \\(-1\\), \\(-2\\), \\(-5\\)). Make sure the position you have identified matches the labeled value.\n\n5. **Check the direction** \u2013 Remember that moving left decreases the value, while moving right increases it. A negative integer will always be left of zero.\n\n**Example:**  \nIf you see a point at the third tick left of zero, count:  \n- 1st tick left \u2192 \\(-1\\)  \n- 2nd tick left \u2192 \\(-2\\)  \n- 3rd tick left \u2192 \\(-3\\)  \n\nThus, the point represents the negative integer \\(-3\\).\n\nBy using the zero reference, counting leftward ticks, and confirming any labels, you can reliably identify any negative integer on a number line."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you move three steps to the left from -2 on a number line, what negative integer will you land on?",
      "student_answer": "You would land on **\u20135**. (Starting at \u20132 and moving three units further left on the number line gives \u20132\u202f\u2212\u202f3\u202f=\u202f\u20135.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "What is the difference between negative integers and positive integers on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "Negative integers and positive integers occupy opposite sides of the zero point on a number line.  \n\n- **Negative integers** are found to the **left of zero**; each one is less than\u202f0 (\u2026,\u202f\u20113,\u202f\u20112,\u202f\u20111).  \n- **Positive integers** are found to the **right of zero**; each one is greater than\u202f0 (1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f\u2026).\n\nBecause the number line runs from left (smaller values) to right (larger values), any negative integer is \u201csmaller\u201d than any positive integer. In other words, moving from a negative integer toward a positive integer means you are increasing the value and crossing zero.  \n\n*(A minor slip: saying that negative integers are always smaller in absolute value than positive integers would be incorrect\u2014\u20115 has a larger absolute value than\u202f3, even though it is still on the negative side.)*"
