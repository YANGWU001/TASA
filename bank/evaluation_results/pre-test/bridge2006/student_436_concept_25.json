      "student_answer": "Um, I think the LCM of 15 and 20 is 30.\n\nUsing prime factorization, I broke them down like this:\n\n- 15\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5  \n- 20\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 (or 2\u00b2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5)\n\nThen I tried to combine the highest powers of each prime. I took one 2, the 3, and the 5, so I got:\n\nLCM\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f30\n\n\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of 8 and 12 is **20**.\n\n**How I tried to find it:**\n\n1. I listed a few multiples of 8: 8,\u202f16,\u202f24,\u202f32,\u202f40\u2026  \n2. Then I listed some multiples of 12: 12,\u202f24,\u202f36,\u202f48,\u202f60\u2026  \n3. I tried to see where the two lists \u201cmeet\u201d and thought maybe the first time they get close is at 20, because 20 is a multiple of 10 and both numbers are kind of close to 10\u2026  \n4. So I guessed that 20 is the smallest number that both 8 and 12 can go into.\n\nI\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right, but that\u2019s what I got."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I'm not totally sure, but I think you would draw a number line and then plot the multiples of each number on it. So you\u2019d put the multiples of\u202f2 (2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f10,\u202f12, \u2026) and the multiples of\u202f5 (5,\u202f10,\u202f15,\u202f20, \u2026). Then you look for the first spot where the two lists line up. \n\nI guess the first point they both hit might be **5**, so maybe the LCM of\u202f2\u202fand\u202f5 is\u202f5? (I could be wrong\u2014I\u2019m kind of confused about how the lines line up.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Why is the LCM of two prime numbers always equal to their product?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is kind of\u2026 maybe because the two primes share a factor? Like, since they\u2019re both prime, they each have themselves as a factor, so the smallest multiple that works for both is just the bigger one\u2026\u202fso the LCM is the larger prime, not the product. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the LCM of 18 and 24 is **36**.\n\nI guess you can use the greatest common factor to help. The GCF of 18 and 24 is\u2026 I think it\u2019s 6, right? If you divide each number by the GCF you get 3 and 4, and then you can multiply those together (3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f12) and maybe also multiply by the GCF again (12\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f72)\u2026 but that seems too big, so maybe you just multiply the reduced numbers (3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f12) and then add the GCF back in some way to get 36? \n\nSo, using the GCF somehow makes the LCM easier to find, even though I\u2019m not completely confident about the exact steps."
