  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of negative integers and their placement on a number line. Most answers are correct, showing they can identify negative integers and explain their characteristics. However, there was a mistake in Question 2 regarding the position of -5, which is not two places to the left of -3. Overall, the student has a solid grasp of the concept.",

      "student_answer": "To spot a negative integer on a number line, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the zero point.**  \n   Zero is the \u201cmiddle\u201d mark that separates the positive side from the negative side.\n\n2. **Look to the left of zero.**  \n   On a standard horizontal number line, all the points that lie **to the left** of the zero mark represent numbers that are less than\u202f0. These are the negative numbers.\n\n3. **Identify the integer marks.**  \n   The equally\u2011spaced ticks that are labeled with whole\u2011number values (\u20111, \u20112, \u20113, \u2026) on the left side are the negative integers. Any tick that has a minus sign in front of the number is a negative integer.\n\n4. **Check the value.**  \n   If the label on a tick is a whole number with a \u201c\u2011\u201d sign (\u20111, \u20112, etc.), then that point is a negative integer. The farther you move left (the larger the absolute value), the more negative the integer becomes.\n\nIn short, a negative integer is any whole\u2011number point that appears left of zero on the number line; it will be marked with a minus sign."

      "question": "What is the difference between negative integers and positive integers on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "Negative integers are the whole\u2011number points that lie to the **left of\u202f0** on a number line.  Because they are left of zero, every negative integer is **less than\u202f0** (\u20111, \u20112, \u20113, \u2026).  \n\nPositive integers are the whole\u2011number points that lie to the **right of\u202f0**.  Anything to the right of zero is **greater than\u202f0** (1,\u202f2,\u202f3, \u2026).  \n\nWhen you move **rightward** along the line the values get larger, and when you move **leftward** they get smaller.  Zero itself is the dividing point and is neither positive nor negative.  \n\n*(One small mistake you might hear at this level is the idea that negative integers always have smaller absolute values than the positive ones \u2013 that\u2019s not true; \u20115 and\u202f5 have the same absolute value.)*"
