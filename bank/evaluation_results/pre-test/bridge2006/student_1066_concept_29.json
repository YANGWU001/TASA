      "question": "Explain why the GCF of a number and its multiple is always the smaller number.",
      "student_answer": "When a number \\(a\\) is multiplied by an integer \\(k\\) (with \\(k\\ge 1\\)), the product is \\(b = k\\cdot a\\).  \nWe want the greatest common factor (GCF) of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n---\n\n### 1. Every divisor of \\(a\\) also divides \\(b\\)\n\nIf \\(d\\) is a divisor of \\(a\\), then \\(a = d\\cdot m\\) for some integer \\(m\\).  \nMultiplying by \\(k\\) gives  \n\n\\[\nb = k\\cdot a = k\\cdot(d\\cdot m)= d\\cdot(km),\n\\]\n\nso the same \\(d\\) also divides \\(b\\).  \nThus **all** factors of the smaller number \\(a\\) are automatically factors of the larger number \\(b\\).\n\n### 2. No divisor larger than \\(a\\) can be common\n\nAny common divisor of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must divide \\(a\\) (by definition).  \nSince \\(a\\) is the smaller number, any integer larger than \\(a\\) cannot divide \\(a\\).  \nTherefore no number greater than \\(a\\) can be a common factor of the two numbers.\n\n### 3. The greatest of the common factors\n\nBecause every factor of \\(a\\) is a common factor, and nothing larger than \\(a\\) can be common, the **largest** common factor is \\(a\\) itself.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{GCF}(a,\\;k\\!a) = a}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Intuitive view:**  \nThink of the smaller number as a \u201cbuilding block.\u201d The larger number is just several copies of that block stacked together. The biggest block that fits evenly into both the single copy and the stacked pile is the single copy itself.\n\nHence, the GCF of any number and any of its multiples is always the smaller number."

No larger number than \\(B\\) can divide \\(B\\), so the greatest common factor of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is exactly the smaller number \\(B\\)."

If the remainder is 0 (i.e., the division is exact), the smaller number is the GCF. No further prime\u2011factor work is needed.  \n\nSo, when one number is known to be a multiple of the other, the GCF is just the smaller number."

      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where finding the GCF of a number and its multiple is useful.",
      "student_answer": "One everyday situation where we use the greatest common factor (GCF) of a number and one of its multiples is **packaging and shipping items in equal\u2011size boxes**.\n\n**Scenario:**  \nA small business produces 180 handmade candles. For a special order, the customer wants the candles shipped in identical boxes, each containing the same number of candles. The company also knows that each box can hold up to 45 candles (a multiple of 15). They need to decide the largest possible number of candles per box that will exactly fill all 180 candles **and** be a size that fits the box dimensions.\n\n**How the GCF helps:**  \n- The total number of candles is 180.  \n- The box capacity is a multiple of the base size, say 45 (which is 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f15).  \n- The GCF of 180 and 45 is\u202f15.  \n\nBecause 15 is the greatest number that divides both the total quantity (180) and the box capacity (45) without a remainder, the business can pack the candles in boxes of **15 candles each**. This uses the largest possible equal\u2011size grouping that fits both constraints, minimizing the number of boxes needed while ensuring every box is completely filled.\n\n**Why this matters:**  \n- **Cost efficiency:** Fewer, fully\u2011filled boxes mean lower shipping and packaging costs.  \n- **Inventory control:** Knowing the GCF helps the business quickly determine the optimal batch size for future orders with different totals or box capacities.  \n- **Customer satisfaction:** The customer receives a consistent product quantity per box, making the order easier to count and store.\n\nIn short, finding the GCF of a total quantity and one of its multiples lets us maximize the size of each equal group\u2014whether that\u2019s boxes, pallets, or containers\u2014while ensuring nothing is left over. This principle is widely used in manufacturing, logistics, event planning, and any situation where items must be divided evenly into groups that conform to a given size constraint."
