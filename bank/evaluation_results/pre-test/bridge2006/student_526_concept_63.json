      "question": "Explain how percentages are used to calculate parts in real-world scenarios.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think percentages are kind of like a shortcut for figuring out how big a piece of something is.\u202fYou usually turn the percent into a decimal (so\u202f20\u202f% becomes\u202f0.20) and then you\u2026 multiply the whole thing by that number to get the part.\u202fFor example, if a store says a jacket is\u202f30\u202f% off, you\u2019d take the original price and multiply it by\u202f0.30\u202fto get the discount amount, and then subtract that from the original price.\u202fThat gives you the sale price.\n\nIn real\u2011world situations you can also do the opposite, right?\u202fIf you know the part and the percent it represents, you just multiply the part by the percent to get the whole.\u202fSo if you know that\u202f15\u202fstudents are\u202f25\u202f% of the class, you\u2019d do\u202f15\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.25\u202f=\u202f3.75\u202fand say the class has about\u202f4\u202fstudents.\u202f(That seems a little weird, but I think that\u2019s how it works.)\n\nSometimes you hear people say \u201cwhat percent of the total is this part?\u201d and you just divide the part by the total and then move the decimal two places.\u202fLike if you sold\u202f200\u202funits out of\u202f800\u202ftotal, you do\u202f200\u202f\u00f7\u202f800\u202f=\u202f0.25\u202fand that\u2019s\u202f25\u202f%.\u202fSo you just multiply by\u202f100\u202fto get the percent.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the \u201cmultiply to get the whole\u201d part though\u2014maybe you actually have to divide the part by the percent expressed as a decimal.\u202fIf you have\u202f50\u202fpeople and that\u2019s\u202f10\u202f% of the crowd, you\u2019d do\u202f50\u202f\u00f7\u202f0.10\u202f=\u202f500\u202fpeople total.\u202fThat sounds right, I guess."

      "question": "How would you calculate the part of a number if you are given its fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019re supposed to multiply the whole number by the denominator of the fraction to get the part.  So if you have, say,\u202f3\u20445 of\u202f20, you\u2019d do\u202f20\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f100, and that would be the \u201cpart.\u201d  (I\u2019m not really confident about that.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe the difference between calculating a part using percentages versus using fractions.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the main difference is that percentages are like fractions but they\u2019re always out of 100, while fractions can be out of any number. So if you want to find a part of something, using a percentage means you multiply the total by the percent\u2011value divided by 100. With a fraction you just multiply the total by the fraction itself. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess percentages are easier because you can just move the decimal point two places to the right or left, whereas fractions require you to find a common denominator first. Also, percentages are always bigger than the same fraction\u2014like \u00bd is the same as 50%, but \u00bd is \u201csmaller\u201d than 50% because it\u2019s not out of 100. \n\nMaybe another difference is that percentages can\u2019t be reduced or simplified like fractions can, so you have to keep the 100 in the denominator even if it cancels out. And I think you can\u2019t convert a fraction to a percentage unless you divide it first, which means fractions are kind of more complicated to use for parts."
