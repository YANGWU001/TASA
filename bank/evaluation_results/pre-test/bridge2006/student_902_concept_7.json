  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of comparing sums, correctly identifying larger quantities in some cases. However, there is a consistent misunderstanding regarding equal sums, where the student often states that neither is larger instead of recognizing the correct larger quantity when applicable. Focus on reinforcing the concept of identifying larger sums even when they are equal to another sum.",
