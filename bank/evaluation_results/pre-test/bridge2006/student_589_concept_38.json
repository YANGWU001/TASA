      "student_answer": "**How to divide a circle into 5 equal sections (each\u202f72\u00b0)**  \n\n1. **Locate the centre** \u2013 Mark the centre\u202f\\(O\\) of the circle (the point that is the same distance from every point on the circumference).\n\n2. **Draw a reference radius** \u2013 From \\(O\\) draw any radius; call the endpoint on the circle \\(A\\). This line \\(OA\\) will be the first dividing line.\n\n3. **Set the angle size** \u2013 In a regular pentagon each central angle is  \n\\[\n\\frac{360^\\circ}{5}=72^\\circ .\n\\]  \nSo we need to mark five radii that are each 72\u00b0 apart.\n\n4. **Use a protractor (the simplest method)**  \n   * Place the centre\u2011point of the protractor on \\(O\\) and align its 0\u00b0 line with radius \\(OA\\).  \n   * From the 0\u00b0 mark, locate the 72\u00b0 mark on the protractor and make a small tick on the circle\u2019s edge.  \n   * Draw a line from \\(O\\) through that tick; call the new endpoint \\(B\\).  \n   * Repeat the process: move the protractor so its 0\u00b0 line is now along \\(OB\\), mark another 72\u00b0 tick, draw the next radius \\(OC\\).  \n   * Continue until you have five radii: \\(OA, OB, OC, OD, OE\\). The last radius will automatically land back on the original point \\(A\\) (since \\(5\\times72^\\circ =360^\\circ\\)).\n\n5. **Check the sections** \u2013 The five arcs \\(AB, BC, CD, DE,\\) and \\(EA\\) should all look the same. If you measure any of them with the protractor, each will be 72\u00b0.\n\n---\n\n### Alternative construction (no protractor)\n\nIf a protractor isn\u2019t available, you can construct a regular pentagon inside the circle and use its vertices as the division points:\n\n1. Draw a horizontal diameter \\(XY\\).  \n2. With the compass set to the radius, draw an arc centered at \\(X\\) that intersects the circle at a point \\(P\\) above the diameter.  \n3. From \\(P\\) draw an arc of the same radius intersecting the circle again at \\(Q\\).  \n4. Continue this \u201cstepping\u2011around\u2011the\u2011circle\u201d process until you have five equally spaced points \\(A, B, C, D, E\\) on the circumference.  \n5. Connect each point to the centre \\(O\\). The resulting radii divide the circle into five equal 72\u00b0 sectors.\n\nBoth methods give you five congruent slices of the circle, each representing one\u2011fifth of the whole."

These radii are the boundaries of the equal sections.\n\n---\n\n### Angle for 9 equal divisions\n\n\\[\n\\text{Angle per division}= \\frac{360^\\circ}{9}=40^\\circ\n\\]\n\nSo each of the 9 sections subtends an angle of **40 degrees** at the centre of the circle."
