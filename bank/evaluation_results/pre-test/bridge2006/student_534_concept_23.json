      "student_answer": "The **least common multiple (LCM)** of two positive integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) can be expressed in terms of their **greatest common divisor (GCD)**:\n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{LCM}(a,b)=\\frac{a\\cdot b}{\\gcd(a,b)}.\n\\]\n\nBecause the GCD is a divisor of both numbers, it \u201ccancels out\u2019\u2019 any overlap in their prime\u2011factor collections.  \n\n### When does the LCM equal the product?\nThe LCM equals the product exactly when the denominator \\(\\gcd(a,b)\\) is **1**.  \nIn other words, the two numbers must have **no common prime factor**\u2014they are *coprime* (relatively prime).\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(a,b)=1 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; \\operatorname{LCM}(a,b)=\\frac{a\\cdot b}{1}=a\\cdot b.\n\\]\n\n### Why this happens\n1. **Prime\u2011factor view**  \n   Write the prime factorizations:\n   \\[\n   a = p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\\cdots p_k^{e_k},\\qquad\n   b = q_1^{f_1}q_2^{f_2}\\cdots q_m^{f_m}.\n   \\]\n   If the two sets \\(\\{p_i\\}\\) and \\(\\{q_j\\}\\) are disjoint (no prime appears in both), the LCM must contain each prime to the highest exponent that appears in either number. Since there is no overlap, that means the LCM simply multiplies all the primes together\u2014exactly the product \\(a\\cdot b\\).\n\n2. **GCD\u2011LCM relationship**  \n   The identity \\(\\operatorname{LCM}(a,b)\\cdot\\gcd(a,b)=a\\cdot b\\) holds for all integers. Setting \\(\\gcd(a,b)=1\\) forces the LCM to absorb the entire product.\n\n### Example\n- \\(a=8=2^{3}\\) and \\(b=15=3\\cdot5\\).  \n  \\(\\gcd(8,15)=1\\).  \n  \\(\\operatorname{LCM}(8,15)=\\frac{8\\cdot15}{1}=120\\).  \n  Indeed, \\(120\\) is the smallest number divisible by both 8 and 15, and it equals \\(8\\times15\\).\n\n### Summary\nThe LCM of two numbers equals their product **whenever the numbers are relatively prime**, because there is no shared factor to \u201csave\u2019\u2019 in the division by the GCD. In all other cases, the LCM will be a proper divisor of the product, reduced by the common factor(s) captured in the GCD."
