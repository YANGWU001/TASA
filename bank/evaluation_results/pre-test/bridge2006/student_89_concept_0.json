  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of multiplication and comparison of products. However, they incorrectly identified the comparison in Question 1 and Question 9, where they stated that the products were equal instead of recognizing the larger quantity. Overall, the student is proficient in identifying larger quantities through multiplication.",
