      "student_answer": "The larger amount is the 3/8\u2011cup of sugar.  \n\nTo see how much more that is than the 1/4 cup, we find the difference:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{8} - \\frac{1}{4}\n   = \\frac{3}{8} - \\frac{2}{8}\n   = \\frac{1}{8}.\n\\]\n\nSo the recipe calls for **3/8 cup**, which is **1/8 cup** more than the 1/4 cup you have."

The extra part in the second jar shows it has more water."

      "student_answer": "I think it\u2019s **less** than\u202f\\( \\frac{4}{9} \\).\n\n**Why:**  \nEating 5 pieces out of 12 gives the fraction \\(\\frac{5}{12}\\).  \nTo compare \\(\\frac{5}{12}\\) and \\(\\frac{4}{9}\\) we can cross\u2011multiply:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 9 = 45 \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad 4 \\times 12 = 48.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(45 < 48\\), the numerator\u2011cross\u2011product for \\(\\frac{5}{12}\\) is smaller, so  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{12} < \\frac{4}{9}.\n\\]\n\nThus eating 5 of the 12 pieces is a little **less** than eating \\(\\frac{4}{9}\\) of a similar\u2011sized bar."
