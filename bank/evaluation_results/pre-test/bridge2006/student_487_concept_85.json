      "question": "Explain how you would calculate the difference between two temperatures measured in Celsius.",
      "student_answer": "To find the difference between two temperatures that are both given in degrees Celsius, you simply subtract one measurement from the other.\n\n1. **Write down the two temperatures.**  \n   Let the first temperature be \\(T_1\\)\u202f\u00b0C and the second be \\(T_2\\)\u202f\u00b0C.\n\n2. **Subtract.**  \n   The temperature difference \\(\\Delta T\\) is  \n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta T = T_2 - T_1\n   \\]\n\n   \u2013 If you want the signed difference (knowing which temperature is higher), keep the sign as shown.  \n   \u2013 If you only need the magnitude of the change, take the absolute value:  \n\n   \\[\n   |\\Delta T| = |T_2 - T_1|\n   \\]\n\n3. **Interpret the result.**  \n   The resulting number is already in degrees Celsius, because the Celsius scale uses the same size unit for any temperature interval. No conversion to another unit is required.\n\n**Example**  \nIf the first measurement is \\(12^\\circ\\text{C}\\) and the second is \\(27^\\circ\\text{C}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta T = 27 - 12 = 15^\\circ\\text{C}\n\\]\n\nSo the temperature increased by 15\u202f\u00b0C."
