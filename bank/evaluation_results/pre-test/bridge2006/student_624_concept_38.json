      "student_answer": "**Step\u2011by\u2011step method to divide a circle into 5 equal sections**\n\n1. **Draw the circle and locate its centre**  \n   - Use a compass to draw a circle. Mark the centre point \\(O\\).\n\n2. **Draw a reference radius**  \n   - Pick any point on the circumference and draw a straight line from that point to \\(O\\). Call this radius \\(OA\\). This will be the first dividing line.\n\n3. **Determine the angle for each sector**  \n   - A full circle is \\(360^\\circ\\). Divide this by 5:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{360^\\circ}{5}=72^\\circ\n     \\]  \n   - Each sector must therefore subtend an angle of \\(72^\\circ\\) at the centre.\n\n4. **Mark the successive angles**  \n   - Using a protractor (or a set square/angle\u2011measuring tool), place its centre on \\(O\\) and align the zero line with radius \\(OA\\).  \n   - Mark a point on the circumference at \\(72^\\circ\\) from \\(OA\\). Draw a radius from \\(O\\) to that point; label it \\(OB\\).  \n   - Repeat the process from \\(OB\\): mark another point \\(72^\\circ\\) further around the circle and draw radius \\(OC\\).  \n   - Continue until you have drawn radii \\(OD\\) and \\(OE\\). After the fifth mark you will return to the original point \\(A\\) (because \\(5 \\times 72^\\circ = 360^\\circ\\)).\n\n5. **Result \u2013 five equal sectors**  \n   - The five radii \\(OA, OB, OC, OD,\\) and \\(OE\\) divide the interior of the circle into five congruent sectors, each with a central angle of \\(72^\\circ\\).  \n\n---\n\n### Alternative (Compass\u2011and\u2011Straightedge) Construction\n\nIf you prefer not to use a protractor, you can construct a regular pentagon inscribed in the circle and then connect the centre to each vertex:\n\n1. Draw a horizontal diameter \\(AB\\).  \n2. With the compass set to the radius, draw an arc from \\(A\\) that intersects the circle at two points; call the upper intersection \\(C\\).  \n3. Using the same radius, place the compass point at \\(C\\) and draw an arc that cuts the circle at \\(D\\).  \n4. Continue this \u201cstep\u2011along\u2011the\u2011circumference\u201d process (placing the compass point on the last intersection) until you have marked five points \\(A, C, D, E, F\\) around the circle. These are the vertices of a regular pentagon.  \n5. Connect each vertex to the centre \\(O\\) with straight lines. The five lines \\(OA, OC, OD, OE,\\) and \\(OF\\) are exactly the divisions you need.\n\nBoth methods give five equal areas, each equal to \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of the total area of the circle."

This is your starting radius.\n5. **Mark the successive angles** \u2013 Using a protractor (or a compass\u2011based construction), measure the angle you just calculated from the first radius, and draw the next radius. Continue this process, stepping the same angle each time, until you have drawn *n* radii.\n6. **Result** \u2013 The radii now split the circle into *n* equal \u201cpie\u2011slice\u201d sectors, each with the same central angle.\n\n**Angle for 9 equal divisions**\n\nHere *n\u202f=\u202f9*.  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Angle per section} = \\frac{360^\\circ}{9} = 40^\\circ\n\\]\n\nSo each of the nine sections subtends a central angle of **40 degrees**.
