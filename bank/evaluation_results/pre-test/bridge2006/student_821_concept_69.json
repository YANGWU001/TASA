Most answers correctly identify the multiplier, though there were some misconceptions regarding the effects on area and width when doubled or scaled. Overall, the student shows good grasp of the topic.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the multiplier if a rectangle has a length of 8 and the width is doubled?",
      "student_answer": "I think the multiplier is\u202f2."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a rectangle\u2019s length is multiplied by 3, what is the new length if the original length was 5?",
      "student_answer": "I think the new length would be \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "A rectangle\u2019s area is increased by multiplying its length by 4. What is the multiplier applied to the length?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier applied to the length is **4**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "The width of a rectangle is tripled. What does the multiplier represent in this case?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier of\u202f3 means the width is being increased by\u202f3\u202funits \u2013 in other words, you add three to the original width."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If the dimensions of a rectangle are multiplied by 2, what happens to the area of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "I think the area will just double when both dimensions are multiplied by\u202f2."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A rectangle has a width of 6 meters. The width is multiplied by a factor of 5. What is the new width?",
      "student_answer": "I think the new width would be \\(6 \\text{ m} \\times 5 = 30 \\text{ meters}\\)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the multiplier used if a rectangle\u2019s width is reduced to half its original size?",
      "student_answer": "I think the multiplier would be\u202f\u00bd\u202f\u2014\u202fin other words,\u202f0.5."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is multiplied by 7, how does the multiplier affect the perimeter of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a rectangle is  \n\n\\[\nP = 2(\\text{length}) + 2(\\text{width}) = 2l + 2w .\n\\]\n\nIf the length \\(l\\) is multiplied by\u202f7, the new length becomes \\(7l\\).  \nPlugging this into the perimeter formula gives  \n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{new}} = 2(7l) + 2w = 14l + 2w .\n\\]\n\nSo the perimeter is **not** multiplied by\u202f7. Only the part of the perimeter that comes from the length (the \\(2l\\) term) is multiplied by\u202f7, while the width contribution stays the same. In other words, the new perimeter is the original perimeter plus an extra \\(12l\\) (since \\(14l+2w = (2l+2w) + 12l\\))."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A rectangle\u2019s dimensions are scaled by multiplying both length and width by 3. What is the multiplier for each dimension?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier for each dimension (both the length and the width) is **3**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "The area of a rectangle is doubled by changing the width. What multiplier was applied to the width?",
      "student_answer": "I think the multiplier applied to the width is **2**."
