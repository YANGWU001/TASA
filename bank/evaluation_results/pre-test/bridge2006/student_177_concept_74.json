      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 3\u20446 would be placed a little past the middle of the line, maybe around the 0.75 spot. Since 3 out of 6 means three parts out of six equal parts, that\u2019s the same as taking half of the line, so it should line up with 1\u20442. In other words, 3\u20446 and 1\u20442 are both \u201chalf\u201d of the whole, so they\u2019re equivalent."

      "question": "Explain how to use a number line to determine if 5/10 and 1/2 are equivalent fractions.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 so, to see if\u202f5\u204410\u202fand\u202f1\u20442\u202fare the same, you draw a number line from\u202f0\u202fto\u202f1. Then you put a mark for\u202f5\u204410\u202fat the halfway point because\u202f5\u202fout of\u202f10\u202fsteps is\u2026 well, I think it\u2019s the middle. After that you try to put\u202f1\u20442\u202fon the line. I guess\u202f1\u20442\u202fis also a half, so you might put it a little bit left of the middle, maybe a quarter of the way from\u202f0\u202fto\u202f1? If the two marks line up exactly, then the fractions are equivalent. If they\u2019re in different spots, they\u2019re not equivalent. \n\nSo you just compare where the two marks land; if they\u2019re on the same spot, the fractions are equal. If they\u2019re not, they\u2019re different. \n\n(I'm not totally sure about the exact placement, but that's the general idea.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 6/12 is the same as 1/2 because if you divide the top and the bottom by 6 you get 1/2.  So\u202f6\u202f\u00f7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f1 and\u202f12\u202f\u00f7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f2, right?  That\u2019s why they\u2019re equivalent.\n\nIf I try to draw it on a number line\u2026 I would put 0 at the left end, 1 at the right end, and then I\u2019d mark the halfway point as 1/2.  I guess the point for 6/12 would be somewhere close to that halfway point, maybe a little bit to the right of 0.5?  I\u2019m not really sure how to show it exactly, but I\u2019d just put a dot a little after the 0.5 mark and label it \u201c6/12 (\u22481/2)\u201d. \n\nSo, on the line it would look like:\n\n```\n0 ---- 0.5 (1/2) ---- 1\n          \u2022\n        6/12\n```\n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about the placement, but I think that shows the idea that 6/12 and 1/2 are the same point on the number line."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I\u2019ll try.  \n\nFirst I\u2019d draw a short number line that goes from\u202f0\u202fto\u202f1. I\u2019d put a big tick at the middle point, because 5\u204410 is \u201chalf\u201d of the whole. So I\u2019d label that middle tick\u202f5\u204410.  \n\nThen, for a fraction that\u2019s supposed to be the same size, I think it would be\u202f2\u20445.  I guess 2\u20445 lands on the same spot as 5\u204410 on the line, so it should be an equivalent fraction.  \n\n(\u2026maybe I\u2019m mixing something up, but that\u2019s what I have.)"

I\u2019m not really sure where exactly, but I guess it\u2019s somewhere near the middle\u2011right side of the line between 0 and 1.\n\nAs for why\u202f\\( \\frac{14}{20} \\) is equivalent, I guess it\u2019s because you can add the numerator and denominator of\u202f\\( \\frac{7}{10} \\) to themselves:  \n\\(7 + 7 = 14\\) and \\(10 + 10 = 20\\).  So the two fractions end up looking the same, which means they represent the same point on the number line.  \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m not totally confident about the placement, though.)"
