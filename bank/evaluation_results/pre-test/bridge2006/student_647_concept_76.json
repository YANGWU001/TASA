      "student_answer": "**How to Find the Greatest Common Factor (GCF) of Two Numbers**\n\nThere are three common ways to determine the GCF (also called the greatest common divisor, GCD).  You can use whichever method feels most comfortable.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Prime\u2011Factor Method  \n\n1. **Factor each number into its prime factors.**  \n   Example:\u202f \u202f48\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u2003\u2003and\u2003\u202f60\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5.\n\n2. **Identify the primes they have in common.**  \n   Both 48 and 60 contain two 2\u2019s and one 3.\n\n3. **Multiply those common primes together.**  \n   GCF\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12.\n\n*Why it works:* The product of the shared prime factors is the largest number that divides both original numbers.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Listing (Common\u2011Factor) Method  \n\n1. **List all factors of each number.**  \n   \u2013 Factors of 48: 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f12,\u202f16,\u202f24,\u202f48.  \n   \u2013 Factors of 60: 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f5,\u202f6,\u202f10,\u202f12,\u202f15,\u202f20,\u202f30,\u202f60.\n\n2. **Find the factors that appear in both lists.**  \n   Common factors: 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f12.\n\n3. **Pick the largest common factor.**  \n   GCF\u202f=\u202f12.\n\n*Tip:* This method is quick for small numbers but becomes cumbersome with larger ones.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Euclidean (Division) Algorithm \u2013 The Fastest for Large Numbers  \n\n1. **Divide the larger number by the smaller number.**  \n   Write: larger\u202f=\u202fquotient\u202f\u00d7\u202fsmaller\u202f+\u202fremainder.  \n\n2. **Replace the larger number with the smaller number, and the smaller number with the remainder.**  \n\n3. **Repeat the process** until the remainder is 0.  \n\n4. **The last non\u2011zero remainder (the divisor at that step) is the GCF.**\n\n**Example with 48 and 60:**\n\n- 60 \u00f7 48 = 1 remainder **12** \u2192 (60,\u202f48) \u2192 (48,\u202f12)  \n- 48 \u00f7 12 = 4 remainder **0** \u2192 stop.  \n\nThe last non\u2011zero remainder is **12**, so GCF(48,\u202f60)\u202f=\u202f12.\n\n*Why it works:* Each step reduces the problem to a smaller pair of numbers that have the same GCF as the original pair. When the remainder reaches 0, the divisor at that stage is the greatest common divisor.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Checklist\n\n| Step | Prime\u2011Factor | Listing | Euclidean |\n|------|--------------|---------|-----------|\n| 1    | Write prime factorizations | Write all factors of each number | Divide larger by smaller |\n| 2    | Keep only the common primes | Identify common factors | Replace numbers (a,\u202fb) \u2192 (b,\u202fremainder) |\n| 3    | Multiply the common primes | Choose the largest common factor | Continue until remainder\u202f=\u202f0 |\n| 4    | Result = GCF | Result = GCF | Result = last non\u2011zero divisor |\n\n---\n\n### When to Use Which Method\n\n- **Small numbers (\u2264\u202f100):** Listing or prime\u2011factor method works fine.  \n- **Medium numbers (\u2264\u202f1,000):** Prime factoring is still manageable.  \n- **Large numbers (or many problems):** The Euclidean algorithm is fastest and avoids heavy factorization.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** The GCF is the biggest number that divides both originals. Pick a method, follow the steps, and you\u2019ll get the answer."

      "student_answer": "The Euclidean algorithm finds the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers\u202f*a* and\u202f*b* by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder when it is divided by the smaller one.
