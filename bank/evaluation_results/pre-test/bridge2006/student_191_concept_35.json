      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "If a square is divided into 4 equal parts, how many smaller squares are formed?",
      "student_answer": "I think the square would be divided into **4** smaller equal squares."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "A square is divided into 9 equal sections. What shape are the sections?",
      "student_answer": "The square is split into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, so each of the nine equal sections is itself a **smaller square**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "I think there would be\u202f4\u202frows and\u202f4\u202fcolumns of smaller squares."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "A square is divided into 25 equal parts. How many parts are in each row?",
      "student_answer": "I think there are **5 parts in each row**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into more equal sections, each individual part becomes smaller \u2013 the more pieces you create, the less area each piece has."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "If a square is divided horizontally and vertically into 4 equal sections, what is the shape of each section?",
      "student_answer": "I think each of the four sections would be a smaller **square**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "I think a square **can** be divided into equal triangles.  \nFor example, if you draw one of the diagonals of a square, the diagonal splits the square into two congruent right\u2011angled triangles. If you draw both diagonals, the square is divided into four smaller triangles that are all the same shape and size (each is an isosceles right triangle).  \n\nSince triangles can fill the whole area without gaps or overlaps, there\u2019s no rule that forces a square to be divided only into smaller squares. So it\u2019s perfectly possible to partition a square into equal\u2011area triangles."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "The original square is split into a \\(6 \\times 6\\) grid (since \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\)).  \nSo each smaller square\u2019s side length is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{6}=2.\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** Each side of the smaller squares is\u202f2\u202funits long."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "I think the reason is that when you cut a square into equal\u202frectangles, you are only splitting one of the sides while leaving the other side the same length.  \n\nFor example, if you draw a vertical line down the middle of a square, each piece has the same height as the original square but only half the original width. Its sides are therefore\u202f\u00bd\u202fthe original width\u202f\u00d7\u202fthe full height, so the two side lengths are not equal \u2013 the shape is a rectangle, not a square.  \n\nThe same idea works for any number of equal rectangles: you divide the length (or the width) into several equal parts, but the other dimension stays unchanged. Because the two dimensions of each piece are different, the aspect ratio is not\u202f1:1, which is what you need for a figure to be a square.  \n\nSo, unless you happen to split the square both horizontally\u202fand\u202fvertically at the same time (which would give you smaller squares), just dividing it into equal rectangles will always change the proportion of the sides and the pieces won\u2019t be squares."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Draw a square divided into 9 equal sections and label the dimensions of each smaller square if the original square has a side length of 3 units.",
      "student_answer": "Here\u2019s a quick sketch of what the figure looks like (the lines are just to show the divisions):\n\n```\n+---+---+---+\n|   |   |   |\n|   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+\n|   |   |   |\n|   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+\n|   |   |   |\n|   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+\n```\n\nThe large outer square has a side length of **3\u202funits**.  \nBecause it\u2019s divided into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, each of the nine smaller squares is\n\n* side length \u2248 **1\u202funit** (3\u202funits \u00f7\u202f3)  \n* so each small square is about **1\u202funit\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202funit** (area \u2248\u202f1\u202funit\u00b2).\n\nI think that\u2019s the required labeling for each of the smaller squares."
