  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the concept of multipliers, particularly in relation to area and perimeter. However, many answers reflect confusion about the definitions and applications of multipliers, especially when it comes to area and dimensions. The student should review the relationship between scaling dimensions and how it affects area and perimeter.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the multiplier if a rectangle has a length of 8 and the width is doubled?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the multiplier would be **3**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a rectangle\u2019s length is multiplied by 3, what is the new length if the original length was 5?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the new length would be 10."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "A rectangle\u2019s area is increased by multiplying its length by 4. What is the multiplier applied to the length?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the multiplier applied to the length is probably **2**. I'm not totally sure, but that seems right."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "The width of a rectangle is tripled. What does the multiplier represent in this case?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the multiplier here is kind of like the total new size of the rectangle, so the \u201c3\u201d would be the new width itself rather than just a factor. In other words, the multiplier represents the actual measurement you get after you triple the width \u2013 like the new width in whatever units you\u2019re using. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If the dimensions of a rectangle are multiplied by 2, what happens to the area of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if you multiply both the length and the width of a rectangle by\u202f2, the area only gets twice as big. So the new area would be double the original area."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A rectangle has a width of 6 meters. The width is multiplied by a factor of 5. What is the new width?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the new width would be\u2026 maybe 11\u202fmeters? I'm not really sure, but that sounds about right."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the multiplier used if a rectangle\u2019s width is reduced to half its original size?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the multiplier would be **2**.  (Since the width is cut in half, you\u2019d have to multiply by 2 to get back to the original size.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is multiplied by 7, how does the multiplier affect the perimeter of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if you make the length seven times bigger, the whole perimeter just gets seven times bigger too. So the new perimeter would be about\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f(original perimeter)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A rectangle\u2019s dimensions are scaled by multiplying both length and width by 3. What is the multiplier for each dimension?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the multiplier for each dimension would be 9."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "The area of a rectangle is doubled by changing the width. What multiplier was applied to the width?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the multiplier must be **4**.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but if you double the area by only changing the width, maybe the width has to be quadrupled?  (I could be getting it mixed up\u2026)"
