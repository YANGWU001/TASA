      "student_answer": "**How to work out the number of equal parts created by\u202f4 vertical bars inside a rectangle**\n\n1. **Identify the bars** \u2013 Look at the rectangle and count how many vertical lines (bars) are drawn inside it.  \n   *In this case you see 4 separate vertical bars.*\n\n2. **Remember the rule** \u2013 Every time you add a vertical bar you split the shape\u202f*one more*\u202ftime.  \n   - With no bars you have 1 whole region.  \n   - 1 bar gives 2 regions.  \n   - 2 bars give 3 regions, and so on.  \n\n   **Number of equal divisions = (number of vertical bars)\u202f+\u202f1.**\n\n3. **Apply the rule** \u2013  \n   \\(4\\text{ bars} + 1 = 5\\).  \n\n   So the rectangle is divided into **5 equal vertical strips**.\n\n4. **Check the spacing (optional but good practice)** \u2013  \n   - Measure the total width of the rectangle.  \n   - Divide that width by 5 (the number of strips you just determined).  \n   - Verify that each bar is placed exactly one\u2011strip\u2011width apart from the next bar and from the left/right edges. If the distances match, the division is indeed equal.\n\n5. **State the result** \u2013  \n   When 4 vertical bars are drawn evenly spaced inside a rectangular shape, the rectangle is split into **five equal vertical sections**."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain why placing 6 vertical bars in a rectangle results in 7 equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "When you draw **six vertical bars** inside a rectangle and space them so that the distance between every two adjacent bars is the same, you are actually creating **the gaps** between the bars as the divisions.  \n\nThink of the rectangle as having a left edge and a right edge as well. Starting at the left edge, you have:\n\n1. The space from the left edge to the first bar.  \n2. The space between bar\u202f1 and bar\u202f2.  \n3. The space between bar\u202f2 and bar\u202f3.  \n4. The space between bar\u202f3 and bar\u202f4.  \n5. The space between bar\u202f4 and bar\u202f5.  \n6. The space between bar\u202f5 and bar\u202f6.  \n7. The space from bar\u202f6 to the right edge of the rectangle.\n\nSo each pair of consecutive \u201cboundaries\u201d (either a bar or an outer edge) defines one region. With six interior bars you have **seven boundaries pairs**, therefore **seven regions**.  \n\nIf the bars are placed at equal intervals, each of those seven regions has the same width, giving you seven equal divisions of the rectangle."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How does the number of vertical bars relate to the total number of equal divisions in a given shape?",
      "student_answer": "The vertical bars are the lines that split the shape into pieces.  \nEach bar creates a new boundary, so the shape is divided into one more part than the number of bars you draw.\n\n**In formula form:**  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of equal divisions} = \\text{Number of vertical bars} + 1\n\\]\n\nFor example, if you draw\u202f3\u202fvertical bars inside a rectangle, the rectangle is broken into\u202f4\u202fequal vertical sections. The bars themselves are the separators; they are not counted as separate sections."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Illustrate with an example how placing 10 vertical bars in a square creates multiple equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided only by vertical lines, each line simply chops the shape into thinner, side\u2011by\u2011side rectangles.  \nIf we draw **10 vertical bars** that are spaced the same distance apart, the square is broken up into a set of equal\u2011width pieces.\n\n**Example**\n\n1. Start with a square that is 10\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202fcm.  \n2. Mark points every 1\u202fcm along the top side (0\u202fcm,\u202f1\u202fcm,\u202f2\u202fcm, \u2026,\u202f9\u202fcm,\u202f10\u202fcm).  \n3. From each of the first ten marks (0\u202fcm through\u202f9\u202fcm) draw a vertical line down to the bottom side.  \n   \u2013 These are the ten vertical bars.  \n4. Because the bars are 1\u202fcm apart, each resulting column is 1\u202fcm wide.\n\nResult: the original square is now split into **10 equal vertical divisions**, each measuring 1\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202fcm. All the pieces have the same area (10\u202fcm\u00b2) and the same shape (thin rectangles), showing how a set of equally spaced vertical bars creates multiple equal divisions in a square."
