      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) of 12 and 16 is **4**. \n\n**Explanation:**  \n- Prime factorization of 12\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3.  \n- Prime factorization of 16\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2.  \n- The common prime factors are two 2\u2019s, giving 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f4.

      "question": "Explain what the greatest common factor (GCF) represents in mathematics.",
      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (often called the greatest common divisor or GCF) of a set of whole numbers is the largest positive integer that divides each of those numbers evenly (i.e., with no remainder).  \n\nIn other words, it is the biggest \u201ccommon\u201d factor that all the numbers share. For two numbers\u202f*a*\u202fand\u202f*b*, the GCF is the greatest number\u202f*d*\u202fsuch that  \n\n\\[\nd \\mid a \\quad\\text{and}\\quad d \\mid b\n\\]\n\nwhere \u201c\u202f\u2223\u202f\u201d means \u201cdivides\u201d.  \n\nThe GCF is useful for simplifying fractions, reducing ratios, solving problems that involve sharing or grouping objects evenly, and for factoring expressions in algebra.  \n\n**Example:**  \nFor the numbers 24 and 36, the factors are  \n\n- 24: 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f12,\u202f24  \n- 36: 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f12,\u202f18,\u202f36  \n\nThe common factors are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f12, and the greatest of these is 12. Hence, \\(\\text{GCF}(24,36)=12\\).  \n\nSo, the GCF represents the largest integer that can be used to \u201cdivide\u201d each of the given numbers without leaving a remainder."
