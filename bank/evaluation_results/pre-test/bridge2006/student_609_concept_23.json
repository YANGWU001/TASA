      "student_answer": "The least\u2011common multiple of two integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) can be written in terms of their greatest common divisor (gcd) as  \n\n\\[\n\\text{lcm}(a,b)=\\frac{a\\;b}{\\gcd(a,b)} .\n\\]\n\nFrom this formula it follows that the LCM will be *exactly* the product \\(a\\;b\\) whenever the denominator \\(\\gcd(a,b)\\) equals\u202f1. In other words, if the two numbers have no common factor greater than\u202f1 (they are **relatively prime**), the fraction reduces to  \n\n\\[\n\\text{lcm}(a,b)=\\frac{a\\;b}{1}=a\\;b .\n\\]\n\nA simple way to see this is to think of the product as \u201call the prime factors of both numbers together.\u201d If the two numbers share no prime factors, none of those factors need to be \u201ccanceled out,\u201d so the smallest number that contains all the required factors is just the product itself.\n\n**Example**\n\n- \\(4 = 2^2\\) and \\(9 = 3^2\\) have no common prime factor, so  \n  \\(\\gcd(4,9)=1\\) and \\(\\text{lcm}(4,9)=4\\times9=36\\).\n\n- \\(6 = 2\\cdot3\\) and \\(35 = 5\\cdot7\\) are also relatively prime, giving  \n  \\(\\text{lcm}(6,35)=6\\times35=210\\).\n\nSo, whenever the two numbers are relatively prime (for instance, when both are prime numbers), their LCM equals their product."

The LCM is the smallest number that both 9 and 15 divide into evenly, while the product is simply the result of multiplying the two numbers together. In this case, the LCM (45) is a factor of the product (135), but they are not the same."

      "student_answer": "One easy way to get a pair of numbers whose LCM is smaller than their product is to pick numbers that share a common factor (i.e., they are **not** relatively prime).  \n\n**Example:**\u202f\\(4\\) and \\(6\\)\n\n* Product:\u2003\\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\)  \n* LCM:\u2003The smallest common multiple of \\(4\\) and \\(6\\) is \\(12\\) (since \\(12\\) is divisible by both \\(4\\) and \\(6\\)).  \n\nBecause the two numbers have a common factor \\(2\\), the LCM does not have to \u201ccarry\u201d the whole factor from each number; the product, on the other hand, always contains every factor from both numbers. Hence  \n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(4,6)=12 \\;<\\; 24 = 4 \\times 6 .\n\\]\n\n**Why this works in general:**  \nIf two integers share a greatest common divisor \\(d>1\\), we can write them as \\(a = d\\cdot m\\) and \\(b = d\\cdot n\\) with \\(\\gcd(m,n)=1\\).

      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nThe least\u2011common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the *smallest* positive integer that both numbers divide into.  \nIf the two numbers share any common factor, the LCM will be **smaller** than their product because the common factor would be counted twice in the product.\n\n---\n\n### 1.

Use the relationship \\( \\displaystyle \\text{LCM}(a,b)=\\frac{a\\;b}{\\gcd(a,b)} \\)\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(10,15)=\\frac{10 \\times 15}{\\gcd(10,15)}\n               =\\frac{150}{5}\n               =30\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 4. Why the LCM is not the product\n\nWhen we multiply 10 and 15, the factor 5 appears **twice** (once from each number).  \nThe LCM only needs each prime factor the **maximum number of times** it occurs in either number:\n\n* prime 2 appears once (from 10) \u2192 keep 2  \n* prime 3 appears once (from 15) \u2192 keep 3  \n* prime 5 appears once (the larger of the two counts) \u2192 keep 5  \n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}=2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 30\n\\]\n\nIf we left the extra 5 from the product, we would get 150, which is **not** the smallest common multiple.\n\n---\n\n**So, the LCM of 10 and 15 is 30, not 150, because the two numbers share the factor 5.**"
