This will be the reference line (0\u00b0).\n\n4. **Measure 72\u00b0** from the line\u202f\\(OA\\) and make a small tick on the circle\u2019s edge. Draw a second radius from \\(O\\) through that tick; label the outer point\u202f\\(B\\).\n\n5. **Repeat the measurement**: from line\u202f\\(OB\\) measure another 72\u00b0, make a tick, and draw radius\u202f\\(OC\\).  \n\n6. **Continue** this process two more times so you obtain points\u202f\\(D\\) and\u202f\\(E\\) on the circumference, each spaced 72\u00b0 apart from the previous one.\n\n7. **Connect** the five radii \\(OA, OB, OC, OD,\\) and \\(OE\\) to the centre. The circle is now divided into five congruent sectors, each bounded by two successive radii.\n\n**Alternative (no protractor) method**  \nIf a protractor isn\u2019t available, you can use a compass and a straightedge:\n\n* Draw a regular pentagon inscribed in the circle (by repeatedly stepping the same radius length around the edge).  \n* Connect each vertex of the pentagon to the centre\u202f\\(O\\). The five resulting triangles are exactly the five equal sectors.\n\nEither approach yields five equal 72\u00b0 sections of the circle."

      "student_answer": "**How to divide a circle into equal sections**\n\n1. **Understand the geometry** \u2013 When a circle is cut into *n* equal parts, each part is a sector whose two radii meet at the centre. The three points (centre\u202fC, and the two points on the circumference A and B) form an isosceles triangle.  \n   The angle at the centre, \u2220ACB, is called the *central angle*.\n\n2. **Find the central angle** \u2013 The total angle around the centre of a circle is 360\u00b0.  \n   If we want *n* equal sections, the central angle for each section is  \n\n   \\[\n   \\text{central angle} = \\frac{360^\\circ}{n}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Mark the angles on the circle**  \n   * **Using a protractor** \u2013 Place the centre of the protractor at the centre of the circle, draw a radius as the 0\u00b0 line, then measure off the central angle repeatedly, drawing a new radius each time.  \n   * **Using a compass and straight\u2011edge** \u2013 Draw the first radius, then copy the same chord length around the circumference *n* times (or use the \u201cdivide\u2011the\u2011circumference\u201d construction) to locate the subsequent points, joining each to the centre.  \n   * **Using a divider** \u2013 Set the divider to the radius, step it off around the circle *n* times, joining each landing point to the centre.\n\n4. **Check the work** \u2013 After all radii are drawn, the sum of the central angles should be 360\u00b0 and each sector should look identical.\n\n---\n\n### Calculation for 9 equal divisions\n\n\\[\n\\text{Central angle} = \\frac{360^\\circ}{9}=40^\\circ.\n\\]\n\nSo each of the nine sectors has a central angle of **40 degrees**.  \n\nIf you draw a radius, then rotate the protractor (or your compass\u2011step) by 40\u00b0 eight more times, you will end up with nine equally spaced radii, partitioning the circle into nine equal parts."
