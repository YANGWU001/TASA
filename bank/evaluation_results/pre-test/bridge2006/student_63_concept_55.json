      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "What is the definition of a proper fraction?",
      "student_answer": "A proper fraction is a fraction in which the numerator is **smaller than** the denominator (both are positive integers). Because the top part is less than the bottom part, the value of a proper fraction is always **less than\u202f1**."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Identify the proper fraction from the options: 7/10, 12/7, 10/10.",
      "student_answer": "The proper fraction among the given options is **7/10**, since its numerator (7) is less than its denominator (10)."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If the numerator is 3 and the denominator is 7, is it a proper fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Yes. Since the numerator\u202f(3) is less than the denominator\u202f(7), the fraction \\( \\frac{3}{7} \\) is a proper fraction."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Choose the proper fraction: 3/4 or 5/2.",
      "student_answer": "The proper fraction is **3/4**, because in a proper fraction the numerator is smaller than the denominator (3\u202f<\u202f4). The fraction 5/2 is an improper fraction (the numerator is larger than the denominator)."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Explain why 2/3 is considered a proper fraction.",
      "student_answer": "A **proper fraction** is defined as a fraction whose numerator is smaller than its denominator. Because the numerator (the top number) tells how many parts we have, and the denominator (the bottom number) tells into how many equal parts the whole is divided, a proper fraction always represents a quantity **less than one whole**.\n\nFor the fraction \\(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\):\n\n- **Numerator:** 2  \n- **Denominator:** 3  \n\nSince \\(2 < 3\\), the fraction is less than one whole unit:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} = 0.\\overline{6} \\;\\text{(approximately 0.666\u2026)} < 1.\n\\]\n\nBecause the numerator is strictly less than the denominator, \\(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\) meets the definition of a proper fraction."
