      "question": "Explain how you can identify a negative integer on a number line.",
      "student_answer": "To locate a **negative integer** on a number line, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the Zero Point**  \n   The number line always has a mark labeled **0**. This is the boundary between the positive and negative sides.\n\n2. **Identify the Left\u2011Hand Side**  \n   All numbers that lie **to the left of 0** are negative. The farther left you go, the larger (in absolute value) the negative number becomes.\n\n3. **Look for Whole\u2011Number Marks**  \n   Integer marks are spaced uniformly (often one unit apart). Starting at 0, count one step left to reach **\u20111**, two steps left for **\u20112**, three steps left for **\u20113**, and so on.\n\n4. **Check the Label**  \n   The mark you land on should be labeled with the negative sign (\u2011) followed by a whole number. That label confirms you have identified a negative integer.\n\n**Summary:**  \nA negative integer is any whole number that appears **left of 0** on the number line, represented by a \u201c\u2011\u201d sign in front of its magnitude (\u20111, \u20112, \u20113, \u2026). By locating 0, moving left the appropriate number of unit steps, and verifying the label, you can reliably identify any negative integer."

      "student_answer": "The integer that lies immediately to the left of \\(-10\\) on a number line is one step smaller, i.e., one unit less than \\(-10\\).\n\n\\[\n-10 - 1 = -11\n\\]\n\n**Answer: \\(-11\\)**"

      "question": "Write down all negative integers between -1 and -10 shown on a number line.",
      "student_answer": "The negative integers that lie **between** \\(-1\\) and \\(-10\\) (i.e., not including the endpoints) are  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-2,\\,-3,\\,-4,\\,-5,\\,-6,\\,-7,\\,-8,\\,-9}\n\\]\n\nThese are all the whole\u2011number points you would see on the number line from \\(-1\\) moving leftward to \\(-10\\), stopping just before each end\u2011point."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you move three steps to the left from -2 on a number line, what negative integer will you land on?",
      "student_answer": "Moving three steps to the left on a number line means subtracting\u202f3 from the starting integer.\n\nStarting at \\(-2\\):\n\n\\[\n-2 - 3 = -5\n\\]\n\nSo after moving three steps left, you land on the negative integer **\\(-5\\)**."

      "question": "What is the difference between negative integers and positive integers on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "On a typical horizontal number line, **zero** sits in the middle.  \n\n- **Positive integers** are the whole\u2011number points that lie to the **right of zero**.  \n  - They are greater than\u202f0 (1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f\u2026) and are usually written without a sign or with a \u201c+\u201d.  \n  - As you move farther right, the values increase.\n\n- **Negative integers** are the whole\u2011number points that lie to the **left of zero**.  \n  - They are less than\u202f0 (\u20111,\u202f\u20112,\u202f\u20113,\u202f\u2026) and are always written with a minus sign (\u2011).  \n  - As you move farther left, the values become smaller (more negative).\n\nIn short, the difference is their position relative to zero: positive integers are on the right side of zero, while negative integers are on the left side. Their magnitudes (absolute values) can be the same (e.g.,\u202f3 and\u202f\u20113), but their signs\u2014and therefore whether they lie to the right or left of zero\u2014are opposite."
