      "question": "What is the contextual meaning of 'difference' when comparing two values?",
      "student_answer": "The \u201cdifference\u201d between two values is the amount by which one value is larger (or smaller) than the other.  \nIn a typical context you compute it by subtracting the smaller (or earlier) value from the larger (or later) one:\n\n\\[\n\\text{difference} = \\text{Value}_\\text{A} - \\text{Value}_\\text{B}\n\\]\n\nThe resulting number tells you the gap, change, or disparity between the two quantities. For example, if a store sold\u202f150\u202funits in January and\u202f120\u202funits in February, the difference is\u202f30\u202funits, meaning January\u2019s sales were\u202f30\u202funits higher than February\u2019s. In everyday language, \u201cdifference\u201d therefore indicates how far apart two numbers are and what the change or variation is between them."

      "question": "Explain how you would calculate the difference between two temperatures measured in Celsius.",
      "student_answer": "To find the difference between two temperature readings that are both expressed in degrees Celsius, you simply subtract one value from the other.  \n\n**Steps**\n\n1. **Write down the two temperatures.**  \n   Example:\u202fT\u2081 = 23\u202f\u00b0C and T\u2082 = 15\u202f\u00b0C.\n\n2. **Subtract the smaller temperature from the larger temperature** (or subtract in the order you need, keeping track of the sign).  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = T_1 - T_2 = 23\\,^\\circ\\text{C} - 15\\,^\\circ\\text{C} = 8\\,^\\circ\\text{C}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Interpret the sign if needed.**  \n   * If you want the *absolute* (magnitude) difference, take the absolute value: |T\u2081\u202f\u2013\u202fT\u2082| = 8\u202f\u00b0C.  \n   * If the sign matters (e.g., to know which temperature is higher), keep the sign: a positive result means the first temperature is higher, a negative result means it is lower.\n\nThat\u2019s all there is to it\u2014no conversion to another scale is required because both measurements are already in the same unit (Celsius)."
