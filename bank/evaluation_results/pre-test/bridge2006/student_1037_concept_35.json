      "question": "A square is divided into 9 equal sections. What shape are the sections?",
      "student_answer": "The square is divided into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, so each of the nine equal sections is itself a **smaller square**."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into 16 equal smaller squares, the division is a 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 grid.  \nSo there are **4 rows** and **4 columns** of the smaller squares."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "A square is divided into 25 equal parts. How many parts are in each row?",
      "student_answer": "Each row contains **5 parts**.  \n\nSince the square is divided into 25 equal parts, it forms a 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 grid (because \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\)). Therefore, there are 5 parts in each row."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into more equal sections, the total area of the square stays the same, so each individual part must occupy a smaller piece of that area. In other words, as the number of equal sections increases, the size (area) of each part decreases."

      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer: Yes \u2013 a square can be divided into equal (congruent) triangles.**  \n\nA square is a polygon, and any polygon can be *triangulated* \u2013 that is, partitioned into a set of non\u2011overlapping triangles whose union is the whole shape.  Because the square is especially regular, we can do this in a way that makes all of the triangles identical.\n\n### Simple examples  \n\n| Number of triangles | How to obtain them | Shape of each triangle |\n|---------------------|--------------------|------------------------|\n| 2 | Draw one diagonal of the square. | Two right\u2011isosceles triangles (legs = side of the square). |\n| 4 | Draw both diagonals (forming an \u201cX\u201d). | Four right\u2011isosceles triangles, each half the size of the two\u2011triangle case. |\n| 8 | Subdivide each of the four triangles above by drawing a line from the right\u2011angle vertex to the midpoint of the hypotenuse. | Eight congruent right triangles (all similar to the original ones). |\n\n### Why it works  \n\n1. **Area matches.**  \n   The area of a square of side\u202f\\(s\\) is \\(s^{2}\\).  \n   When you cut the square along a diagonal, each triangle has base \\(s\\) and height \\(s\\), so its area is \\(\\tfrac12 s^{2}\\). Two of these together give the full area \\(s^{2}\\). The same principle holds for any further subdivision: the sum of the areas of the congruent triangles equals the area of the square.\n\n2. **Angles line up.**  \n   A triangle\u2019s interior angles sum to \\(180^{\\circ}\\). By arranging the triangles so that their right\u2011angle corners meet at the vertices of the square (or at the center), the surrounding angles around each vertex add up to the \\(90^{\\circ}\\) corner of the square (or to \\(360^{\\circ}\\) around the centre). Thus the pieces fit together without gaps or overlaps.\n\n3. **Triangulation theorem.**  \n   In planar geometry, every simple polygon can be partitioned into triangles whose vertices are a subset of the polygon\u2019s vertices. Since the square\u2019s vertices are already available, we can always connect them (or points on the sides) to form congruent triangles.\n\n### Can we get *any* number of equal triangles?  \n\nNot every integer works, but many do.  \n- An even number is always possible: start with the two\u2011triangle diagonal division and then repeatedly bisect each triangle by drawing a line from the right\u2011angle vertex to the midpoint of its hypotenuse. Each bisection doubles the number of congruent triangles, giving \\(2,4,8,16,\\dots\\).  \n- Other numbers (e.g., 3) are also possible, but the triangles will not be right\u2011isosceles; they can be constructed by placing three congruent triangles that meet at the centre, each having a \\(120^{\\circ}\\) angle at the centre and \\(30^{\\circ}\\)\u2013\\(30^{\\circ}\\)\u2013\\(120^{\\circ}\\) shapes.\n\n### Bottom line  \n\nBecause a square can be triangulated and because we can choose the lines of division so that all resulting triangles have the same shape and size, a square **can indeed be divided into equal triangles**. The simplest demonstration is the diagonal split into two congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles."

      "student_answer": "The 36 equal smaller squares form a \\(6 \\times 6\\) grid (since \\( \\sqrt{36}=6\\)).  \nEach side of a smaller square is therefore  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{original side length}}{6}= \\frac{12}{6}=2.\n\\]\n\n**Length of each side of the smaller squares: 2 (units).**"

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is cut into several pieces that are **equal rectangles**, each piece has the same **area** and the same **shape**, but not necessarily the same **side\u2011lengths**.  \n\nA rectangle is a quadrilateral whose opposite sides are equal and whose angles are right angles.  \nA square is a special rectangle whose **four sides are all equal**.\n\nIf we split a square by drawing a single line parallel to one side, we get two pieces whose dimensions are  \n\n\\[\n\\text{height}=s,\\qquad \\text{width}= \\frac{s}{2},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(s\\) is the side length of the original square.  \nBoth pieces have the same area \\(\\frac{s^{2}}{2}\\) and the same shape (they are congruent), but the two side\u2011lengths are different (\\(s\\neq s/2\\)), so each piece is a **rectangle**, not a square.\n\nThe only way the pieces could also be squares is if we subdivide the original square **equally in both directions**\u2014for example, cutting it into a \\(2\\times2\\), \\(3\\times3\\), \u2026 grid. In that case each small piece has side length \\(s/n\\) and remains a square.  \n\nAny division that changes only one dimension (or changes the two dimensions by different factors) forces the resulting parts to have unequal side lengths, and therefore they are rectangles, not squares."

      "student_answer": "Here is a schematic of the large square (side\u202f=\u202f3\u202funits) divided into 9 equal smaller squares, together with the dimensions of each small square.\n\n```\n+-------+-------+-------+\n|       |       |       |\n|  1\u00d71  |  1\u00d71  |  1\u00d71  |\n|       |       |       |\n+-------+-------+-------+\n|       |       |       |\n|  1\u00d71  |  1\u00d71  |  1\u00d71  |\n|       |       |       |\n+-------+-------+-------+\n|       |       |       |\n|  1\u00d71  |  1\u00d71  |  1\u00d71  |\n|       |       |       |\n+-------+-------+-------+\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n\n- The original square has side length \\(3\\)\u202funits.  \n- Dividing it into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid produces 9 congruent smaller squares.  \n- Each small square\u2019s side length is \\(\\frac{3\\text{ units}}{3}=1\\)\u202funit.  \n- Consequently, each small square has dimensions **1\u202funit\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202funit** (area\u202f=\u202f1\u202fsquare\u202funit).\n\nSo every one of the nine little squares measures 1\u202funit on each side."
