      "student_answer": "Isolating the variable\u202f\\(x\\) means rewriting the equation so that \\(x\\) appears by itself on one side of the equals sign, with everything else moved to the opposite side. In other words, you \u201csolve for\u202f\\(x\\).\u201d\n\nWhen the equation contains subtraction, you treat the subtraction as the addition of a negative number and then do the opposite operation (i.e., addition) to both sides. Here\u2019s the step\u2011by\u2011step idea:\n\n1. **Identify the term that is subtracted from\u202f\\(x\\).**  \n   Example: \\(x - 5 = 12\\).\n\n2. **Undo the subtraction by adding the same number to both sides.**  \n   Since \\(x\\) is reduced by 5, add 5 to each side:  \n   \\[\n   x - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; x = 17.\n   \\]\n\n3. **If the subtraction is on the other side of the equation, move it to the opposite side first.**  \n   Example: \\(7 = x - 3\\).  \n   Add 3 to both sides (the opposite of \u201csubtract 3\u201d):  \n   \\[\n   7 + 3 = x - 3 + 3 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; 10 = x,\n   \\]\n   or \\(x = 10\\) after swapping sides.\n\n4. **When multiple terms are subtracted, treat each separately.**  \n   Example: \\(x - 4 - 2 = 9\\).  \n   Combine the subtractions (\\(x - 6 = 9\\)) and then add 6 to both sides:  \n   \\[\n   x = 15.\n   \\]\n\n**Key points to remember**\n\n- Subtraction is \u201cundoed\u201d by adding the same amount to both sides.\n- You may need to rearrange the equation first so the subtraction is directly attached to the \\(x\\) you want to isolate.\n- Always perform the same operation on **both** sides of the equation; this keeps the equality true.\n\nBy following these steps, you end up with an equation where \\(x\\) stands alone, which is exactly what \u201cisolating the variable\u202f\\(x\\)\u201d means."
