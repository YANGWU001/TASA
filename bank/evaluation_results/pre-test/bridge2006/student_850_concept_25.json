By plotting all multiples of each number on the same line, the first intersection point visually shows the smallest shared multiple."

      "student_answer": "The least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that both numbers divide into evenly.  \n\nWhen the two numbers are **prime**, each one has no divisors other than 1 and itself.  \nBecause of that, the two primes share **no common factor greater than\u202f1**.  \n\nIf the primes are \\(p\\) and \\(q\\):\n\n* The only common divisor they have is 1.\n* Any multiple of \\(p\\) looks like \\(p, 2p, 3p, \\dots\\).\n* Any multiple of \\(q\\) looks like \\(q, 2q, 3q, \\dots\\).\n\nThe first number that appears in both lists must contain **both** prime factors, because you cannot get a multiple of \\(p\\) that is also a multiple of \\(q\\) unless you include the factor \\(q\\) (and vice\u2011versa). The smallest such number is simply the product \\(p \\times q\\).\n\nTherefore the LCM of two distinct prime numbers is their product:\n\\[\n\\operatorname{LCM}(p,q)=p\\cdot q.\n\\]\n\n(If the two primes happen to be the same prime, say \\(p\\) and \\(p\\), then the LCM is just \\(p\\); but for two different primes the LCM equals the product.)"

By dividing the product \\(ab\\) by this overlap, you remove the duplicated factors, leaving exactly the smallest number that contains all the required prime factors\u2014i.e., the LCM."
