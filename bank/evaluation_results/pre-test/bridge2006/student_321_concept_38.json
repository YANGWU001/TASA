      "question": "Describe how you would divide a circle into 5 equal sections.",
      "student_answer": "To cut a circle into five equal parts you need to create five radii that are spaced the same angular distance apart.  \nSince a full circle is\u202f360\u00b0, each slice must have a central angle of  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{360^\\circ}{5}=72^\\circ .\n\\]\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. **Draw the circle and its centre**  \n   \u2013 Use a compass to draw the circle and mark its centre point\u202f\\(O\\).\n\n2. **Draw a reference radius**  \n   \u2013 Draw any straight line from \\(O\\) to the circumference; call the point where it meets the edge \\(A\\). This will be the first dividing line.\n\n3. **Mark a 72\u00b0 angle repeatedly**  \n   \u2013 Place a protractor with its centre at \\(O\\) and the zero\u2011line aligned with \\(OA\\).  \n   \u2013 Make a small mark on the circle at the \\(72^\\circ\\) position; label that point \\(B\\).  \n   \u2013 Draw the radius \\(OB\\).  \n\n   \u2013 Without moving the protractor, rotate it so the zero\u2011line now lines up with \\(OB\\).  \n   \u2013 Mark the next point at \\(72^\\circ\\) from \\(B\\); label it \\(C\\).  \n   \u2013 Draw \\(OC\\).  \n\n   \u2013 Repeat this process two more times to obtain points \\(D\\) and \\(E\\) and radii \\(OD\\) and \\(OE\\).\n\n4. **Check the division**  \n   \u2013 You should now have five radii: \\(OA, OB, OC, OD,\\) and \\(OE\\).  \n   \u2013 The arcs between successive points \\(A\\!-\\!B,\\; B\\!-\\!C,\\; C\\!-\\!D,\\; D\\!-\\!E,\\) and \\(E\\!-\\!A\\) are all 72\u00b0, so the circle is split into five equal sectors.\n\n5. **(Optional) Draw the dividing lines**  \n   \u2013 If you need the actual \u201ccuts,\u201d draw straight lines along each radius from the centre to the edge. The interior of the circle is now five congruent wedge\u2011shaped pieces.\n\n**Quick tip:** If a protractor isn\u2019t available, you can construct a regular pentagon inside the circle (using a compass and straightedge) and then draw radii to its vertices; those radii also divide the circle into five equal 72\u00b0 sectors."

      "student_answer": "**How to divide a circle into equal sections**\n\n1. **Know the total angle around the centre** \u2013 A full circle is\u202f360\u00b0.\n2. **Decide how many equal parts you want** \u2013 call this number *n*.\n3. **Find the size of each central angle**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{central angle} = \\frac{360^\\circ}{n}\n   \\]\n4. **Mark the angles** \u2013 Starting from any radius (the \u201c0\u00b0\u201d line), measure the central angle repeatedly around the circle.  \n   - You can use a protractor, a set\u2011square, or a ruler and a compass to lay off the angles accurately.\n   - Draw a straight line (radius) from the centre to the circumference at each marked point.  \n   - The lines you draw will split the circle into *n* identical \u201cpie\u2011slice\u201d sectors.\n\n5. **Check your work** \u2013 The sum of all the central angles you have drawn should add up to 360\u00b0, and the number of sectors you have should match *n*.\n\n---\n\n**Angle for 9 equal divisions**\n\nFor *n* = 9:\n\n\\[\n\\text{central angle} = \\frac{360^\\circ}{9}=40^\\circ.\n\\]\n\nSo each of the nine sectors has a central angle of **40 degrees**. To create the nine sections, start at any radius, measure off 40\u00b0 each time around the circle, and draw a radius at each mark. The result is nine identical slices, each spanning 40\u00b0."
