      "question": "A tank contains 60 liters of water, and 2/3 of it is used for irrigation. How many liters of water were used?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I\u2019m supposed to find two\u2011thirds of 60. Let\u2019s see\u2026 two\u2011thirds is like dividing by three and then multiplying by two, right? So 60 \u00f7 3 = 20, and 20 \u00d7 2 = 40. But\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing it up and it should be the other way around? If I multiply first: 60 \u00d7 2 = 120, then \u00f7 3 = 40 again\u2026 Hmm. Actually, I\u2019m not sure\u2026 maybe it\u2019s 30 liters? \n\nSo, I guess the amount used is **30\u202fL**. (Sorry if that\u2019s not right.)"
