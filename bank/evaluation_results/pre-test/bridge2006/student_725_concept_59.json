      "student_answer": "The only improper fraction in the list is **\\( \\displaystyle \\frac{12}{11} \\)**, because its numerator (12) is greater than its denominator (11). All the other fractions have numerators smaller than their denominators, so they are proper fractions."

      "student_answer": "An **improper fraction** is a fraction whose numerator is **greater than or equal to** its denominator (while the denominator is non\u2011zero). In other words, the whole number part of the fraction is at least 1, so the fraction is equal to or larger than the integer\u202f1.  \n\n**Key points**\n- Numerator\u202f\u2265\u202fDenominator (in absolute value).\n- The denominator cannot be zero.\n- Examples: \\(\\frac{7}{5}\\), \\(\\frac{4}{4}\\), \\(\\frac{-9}{3}\\) (if you consider negative values, the magnitude of the numerator exceeds that of the denominator).  \n\nWhen the numerator is smaller than the denominator, the fraction is called a **proper fraction**."

Therefore \\(\\dfrac{11}{10}\\) does not represent a proper \u201cpart\u2011of\u2011a\u2011whole\u201d situation; it actually represents a value larger than one (specifically, \\(1 \\frac{1}{10}\\)).  \n\nBecause the numerator is larger than the denominator, \\(\\dfrac{11}{10}\\) is classified as an **improper fraction**."
