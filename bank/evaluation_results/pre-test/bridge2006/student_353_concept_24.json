Therefore, the LCM of 5 and 20 is **20**."

      "student_answer": "**LCM:**\u202f24  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that both numbers divide into without a remainder.  \n\n- List a few multiples of the larger number, 24:\u202f24,\u202f48,\u202f72,\u202f\u2026  \n- Check which of these is also a multiple of the smaller number, 8.  \n\nSince 24 \u00f7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f3, 24 is already a multiple of 8. It is the first (and thus the smallest) multiple of 24 that is also divisible by 8. Therefore, the LCM of 8 and 24 is **24**."

      "question": "True or False: If one number is a multiple of another, their LCM is always the larger number. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:\u202fTrue**\n\n**Justification:**  \nIf one integer \\(a\\) is a multiple of another integer \\(b\\), then we can write \\(a = k \\, b\\) for some integer \\(k \\ge 1\\). Every multiple of \\(a\\) is automatically a multiple of \\(b\\) (because multiplying \\(a\\) by any integer also multiplies \\(b\\) by that integer times \\(k\\)). Hence the set of common multiples of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is exactly the set of multiples of the larger number \\(a\\). The smallest positive element in that set is \\(a\\) itself, so the least common multiple (LCM) of the two numbers is the larger number.  \n\n*Example:* for 4 and 12, 12\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4, and the LCM(4,\u202f12)\u202f=\u202f12."

      "student_answer": "The least common multiple (LCM) of 15 and 45 is **45**.\n\n**Why it\u2019s simple:**  \nSince 45 is exactly\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f15, 45 is already a multiple of 15. When one number is a multiple of the other, the larger number automatically serves as the smallest number that both can divide into evenly. Therefore the LCM is just the larger number, 45."
