      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) of a number and any of its multiples is always the smaller number because the smaller number **divides** the larger one exactly.\n\n1. **Definition of a multiple** \u2013 If \\(b\\) is a multiple of \\(a\\), we can write \\(b = a \\times k\\) for some integer \\(k\\).  \n2. **All factors of \\(a\\) are also factors of \\(b\\)** \u2013 Because \\(b\\) is just \\(a\\) multiplied by another whole number, every divisor of \\(a\\) will also divide \\(b\\) (you can \u201ccancel\u201d the extra factor \\(k\\)).  \n3. **Common factors** \u2013 The set of common factors of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is therefore exactly the set of factors of the smaller number \\(a\\).  \n4. **Greatest of those common factors** \u2013 The largest element in that set is the number \\(a\\) itself. Hence the GCF is \\(a\\), the smaller of the two numbers.\n\n**Example**:  \nTake 8 and its multiple 24. Since \\(24 = 8 \\times 3\\), every divisor of 8 (1, 2, 4, 8) also divides 24. The largest common divisor is 8, which is the smaller number.\n\nSo, whenever one number is a multiple of the other, the greatest common factor is simply the smaller number."

      "question": "How can you determine the GCF of two numbers where one is a multiple of the other without fully factoring both numbers?",
      "student_answer": "When one of the numbers is a multiple of the other, the greatest common factor (GCF) is simply the smaller number.  \nYou can see this without doing a full prime\u2011factor breakdown by following these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the two numbers.**  \n   Let the numbers be \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(a<b\\).\n\n2. **Check whether the larger number is a multiple of the smaller.**  \n   Divide \\(b\\) by \\(a\\).  \n   - If \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{b}{a}\\) is an integer (i.e., there is no remainder), then \\(b\\) is a multiple of \\(a\\).  \n   - If there is a remainder, the numbers are not in a \u201cmultiple\u2011of\u2011each\u2011other\u201d relationship, and you\u2019d need another method (e.g., Euclidean algorithm).\n\n3. **Conclude the GCF.**  \n   When the division is exact, every factor of the smaller number also divides the larger one, so the **greatest** factor they share is the smaller number itself:\n   \\[\n   \\text{GCF}(a,b)=a.\n   \\]\n\n### Quick Example\n- Numbers: 24 and 72.  \n- Divide the larger by the smaller: \\(72 \\div 24 = 3\\) (no remainder).  \n- Since 72 is a multiple of 24, the GCF is 24.\n\n### Why This Works\nIf \\(b = k\\cdot a\\) for some integer \\(k\\), any divisor of \\(a\\) also divides \\(b\\) (because \\(b = k \\times a\\)). The largest such divisor is \\(a\\) itself, so the GCF cannot be larger than \\(a\\) and must equal \\(a\\).\n\n**In summary:** To find the GCF when one number is a multiple of the other, simply verify the divisibility; the smaller number is the GCF, eliminating the need for full factorization."

      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers is the largest whole number that divides **both** of them without leaving a remainder.\n\n1. **List the factors of each number.**  \n   - Factors of **7**: 1, **7** (since 7 is a prime number).  \n   - Factors of **21**: 1, 3, **7**, 21.\n\n2. **Identify the common factors.**  \n   The numbers that appear in both lists are 1 and 7.\n\n3. **Choose the greatest one.**  \n   Between the common factors 1 and 7, the larger is **7**.\n\n4. **Why 7 is automatically the GCF when one number is a multiple of the other.**  \n   Because 21\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f7, 21 is a multiple of 7.

      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where finding the GCF of a number and its multiple is useful.",
      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011life situation where you need the greatest common factor (GCF) of a number and one of its multiples is **planning how to divide a set of items into the largest possible equal groups without leftovers**.\n\n**Scenario \u2013 Packing snacks for a field trip**\n\nA teacher has 48 granola bars to give out to her students. She knows that each student should receive the same number of bars, and she also wants each snack pack to contain the same number of bars so that the packs are easy to hand out. However, the school\u2019s snack bag comes in packs that hold a multiple of 12 bars (because the bag\u2019s size is fixed). The teacher therefore needs to find the largest number of bars she can put in each bag while still being able to give every student the same amount.\n\nHere\u2019s how the GCF helps:\n\n1. **Identify the two numbers**  \n   - The total number of bars: 48  \n   - A possible bag size that is a multiple of 12: e.g., 60 (12\u202f\u00d7\u202f5), 72 (12\u202f\u00d7\u202f6), etc.  \n\n2. **Choose a convenient multiple** \u2013 suppose the teacher decides to order bags that hold **60 bars** (because the vendor only sells that size).  \n\n3. **Find the GCF of 48 and 60**  \n   - Prime factorization:  \n     - 48 = 2\u00b3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3  \n     - 60 = 2\u00b2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5  \n   - The common factors are 2\u00b2 and 3, so GCF = 2\u00b2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 = **12**.\n\n4. **Interpret the result**  \n   - The GCF (12) tells the teacher the biggest number of bars that can be placed in each bag **and** given to each student without any leftovers.  \n   - She can therefore fill the 60\u2011bar bag with five groups of 12 bars, and each of the four students (48\u202f\u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f4) will receive exactly one group of 12 bars.  \n\nThus, by using the GCF of the total number of items (48) and a convenient multiple (60), the teacher determines the largest equal portion size (12 bars) that works both for packaging and for fair distribution.\n\n**Why the GCF matters here:**  \n- It maximizes the size of each portion, reducing the number of separate packs the teacher has to handle.  \n- It guarantees that there will be **no leftover bars** in either the total inventory or the packaging size.  \n\nThis same reasoning applies to many other situations\u2014such as arranging tiles on a floor, scheduling recurring appointments, or loading pallets in a warehouse\u2014where you need the biggest common \u201cbuilding block\u2019\u2019 that fits both a given quantity and a convenient multiple."
