The correct approach is to take the highest power of each common prime that appears in both factorizations.)*  \n\n4. **Multiply the common prime factors together.**  \n   - Using the correct method, take each common prime to the lowest exponent that appears in both factorizations.  \n   - For 48 (\\(2^4\u00b73\\)) and 180 (\\(2^2\u00b73^2\u00b75\\)), the lowest powers are \\(2^2\\) and \\(3^1\\).  \n   - Multiply: \\(2^2\u00b73 = 4\u00b73 = 12\\).\n\n5. **Result:** The product from step\u202f4 is the GCF.  \n   - In the example, the GCF of 48 and 180 is **12**.\n\n---\n\n**Quick Summary**\n\n- Prime\u2011factor each number.  \n- Find the primes they share.  \n- Use the lowest exponent of each shared prime (not the smallest prime itself).  \n- Multiply those together \u2192 that product is the GCF."

      "student_answer": "The Euclidean algorithm finds the greatest common factor (GCF) by repeatedly applying the division algorithm until a remainder of\u202f0 is obtained.  \n\n**Steps**\n\n1. **Start** with the two numbers, call the larger one\u202f\\(a\\) and the smaller one\u202f\\(b\\).  \n2. **Divide** \\(a\\) by \\(b\\) and write the result as  \n   \\[\n   a = b\\cdot q_1 + r_1\\qquad(0\\le r_1<b)\n   \\]  \n   where \\(q_1\\) is the quotient and \\(r_1\\) is the remainder.  \n3. **Replace** the pair \\((a,b)\\) with \\((b,r_1)\\).  \n4. **Repeat** the division: divide the new larger number by the new smaller number, obtain a new remainder, and keep swapping.  \n\n5. **Stop** when a remainder of\u202f0 is produced. The divisor used in that last division (the last non\u2011zero remainder) is the GCF of the original two numbers.\n\n**Why it works**  \nEach step preserves the set of common divisors: any number that divides both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) also divides \\(b\\) and the remainder \\(r_1\\), and vice\u2011versa. After finitely many steps the remainder becomes 0, and the last non\u2011zero remainder is the largest integer that divides both original numbers.\n\n**Example (48 and 18)**  \n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n48 &= 18\\cdot 2 + 12 \\quad &\\text{(remainder }r_1=12)\\\\\n18 &= 12\\cdot 1 + 6  \\quad &\\text{(remainder }r_2=6)\\\\\n12 &= 6\\cdot 2 + 0   \\quad &\\text{(remainder }r_3=0)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nThe last non\u2011zero remainder is\u202f6, so \\(\\gcf(48,18)=6\\).\n\nThus, by repeatedly dividing and taking remainders, the Euclidean algorithm efficiently produces the GCF."

The fraction \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) is easier to work with and clearly shows that the original fraction was equivalent to two thirds. This is why finding the GCF is an essential step in simplifying fractions."
