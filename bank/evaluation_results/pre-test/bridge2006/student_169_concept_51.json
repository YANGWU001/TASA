      "student_answer": "The fraction\u202f\\( \\frac{2}{7} \\) divides a whole into **7 equal parts**, so it can form **7 equal groups**."

      "student_answer": "The numerator (\u202f4\u202f) tells you how many equal parts (or groups) you have.  \nIn the fraction \\( \\frac{4}{12} \\), it means you have **4 equal groups** out of a total of 12 equal groups that would make up the whole."

      "question": "Explain how the numerator and denominator of a fraction help in identifying equal groups.",
      "student_answer": "The numerator and denominator each tell us a different piece of the \u201cequal\u2011group\u201d story in a fraction.\n\n* **Denominator\u202f\u2013\u202fhow many equal parts the whole is divided into**  \n  The denominator tells us the total number of identical pieces that make up one whole. For example, in \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) the \u201c5\u201d means the whole has been split into 5 equal parts.\n\n* **Numerator\u202f\u2013\u202fhow many of those equal parts we have**  \n  The numerator tells us how many of the equal pieces are being considered or taken. In \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) the \u201c3\u201d means we are looking at 3 of the 5 equal parts.\n\nBecause the denominator sets the size of each \u201cgroup\u201d (the size of each equal piece) and the numerator counts how many of those groups we have, the fraction directly shows how many equal groups are being used and how large each group is. This makes it easy to compare fractions, combine them, or visualize situations such as \u201c3 out of 5 equal slices of a pizza\u201d or \u201c2 of the 4 equal sections of a garden\u201d."

      "question": "If a fraction is 7/15, how can you determine the number of equal groups represented?",
      "student_answer": "To find the number of equal groups a fraction refers to, look at its denominator.\n\nFor the fraction \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{7}{15}\\):\n\n* The denominator **15** tells you that the whole is divided into **15 equal parts** (or groups).  \n* The numerator **7** tells you that **7 of those 15 groups** are being taken or shaded.\n\nSo the number of equal groups represented by \\(\\frac{7}{15}\\) is **15**.  You can picture it by dividing a whole object (a pizza, a bar, etc.) into 15 equal slices and then counting the 7 slices that belong to the fraction."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If there are 5 equal groups of a fraction, what could the numerator and denominator be?",
      "student_answer": "When a fraction is described as being \u201csplit into 5 equal groups,\u201d the denominator of the fraction is 5 (the denominator tells us into how many equal parts the whole is divided).  \nThe numerator tells us how many of those equal parts we are referring to, so it can be any whole number from\u202f1\u202fto\u202f5.\n\n**Example:**  \n- If we are talking about one of the five groups, the fraction is \\( \\displaystyle \\frac{1}{5}\\).  \n- If we are talking about three of the five groups, the fraction is \\( \\displaystyle \\frac{3}{5}\\).\n\nSo a possible numerator/denominator pair is **\\( \\frac{3}{5}\\)** (or generally, numerator\u202f=\u202f1\u20135, denominator\u202f=\u202f5)."

      "question": "Describe a real-world example where identifying the number of equal groups from a fraction is useful.",
      "student_answer": "A practical situation where you must determine the number of equal groups from a fraction is when a family shares a pizza.  \n\nSuppose a large pizza is cut into 8 equal slices. The family decides that each of the 4 children will get the same amount of pizza. To find out how many slices each child receives, you look at the fraction of the pizza that each child should get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Fraction per child}= \\frac{8\\text{ slices}}{4\\text{ children}} = \\frac{8}{4}=2\\text{ slices}.\n\\]\n\nIn terms of the whole pizza, each child receives \\( \\frac{2}{8}= \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the pizza.  \n\nIdentifying that the fraction \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) corresponds to **4 equal groups** (one group for each child) helps the family divide the pizza fairly without having to count each slice repeatedly. This same kind of reasoning is used in many everyday tasks, such as portioning a cake, dividing a bag of candy among friends, or allocating a budget in equal parts."
