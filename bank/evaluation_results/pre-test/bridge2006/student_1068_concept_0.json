  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of comparing products through multiplication. However, there were some misconceptions in questions 1, 5, and 9, where the student incorrectly identified equal products as neither being larger. Overall, the student shows good analytical skills in evaluating multiplication results.",
