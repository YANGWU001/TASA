      "student_answer": "When one integer is a multiple of the other, the greatest common factor is just the smaller integer.  \nYou can verify this without doing a full prime\u2011factor breakdown:\n\n1. Identify which of the two numbers is the smaller one.  \n2. Divide the larger number by the smaller number.  \n3. If the division comes out evenly (remainder\u202f=\u202f0), the smaller number divides the larger exactly, so it is the greatest common factor.\n\nBecause the larger number contains every factor of the smaller one (by definition of being a multiple), there is no larger common factor than the smaller number itself. Thus the GCF is simply the smaller of the two numbers."

      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) is the largest whole number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n- **7** is a factor of itself, so it certainly divides 7.\n- **21** can be written as\u202f\\(21 = 7 \\times 3\\).  \n  Therefore 7 also divides 21 exactly.\n\nNow we check whether any number larger than 7 could be a common factor of both 7 and 21.  \nThe only numbers that are larger than 7 and could possibly divide 7 are 8,\u202f9,\u202f10,\u202f\u2026 etc., but none of those numbers divide 7 at all (they all leave a remainder). Hence there is **no** common factor greater than 7.\n\nSince 7 is a common divisor of both numbers and no larger common divisor exists, the greatest common factor of 7 and 21 is **7**."

      "question": "If the GCF of two numbers is 20 and one of the numbers is 80, what could the other number be?",
      "student_answer": "Since the greatest common factor is\u202f20, the other number must be a multiple of\u202f20.  \nWrite the two numbers as  \n\n\\[\n80 = 20 \\times 4,\\qquad \\text{other number}=20 \\times k\n\\]\n\nFor the GCF to stay 20, the factors of\u202f\\(k\\) must not share any additional factor with\u202f4; in other words,\u202f\\(k\\) must be odd.  \n\nSo the other number can be any odd multiple of\u202f20 (e.g.,\u202f20,\u202f60,\u202f100,\u202f140,\u202f\u2026).\n\nOne simple possible value is **60**."

      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where finding the GCF of a number and its multiple is useful.",
      "student_answer": "**Real\u2011life scenario \u2013 Packing items into equal groups**\n\nImagine a bakery that has baked **84 cupcakes** for a school fundraiser. The school wants to put the cupcakes into boxes so that every box has the same number of cupcakes and there are no cupcakes left over. The bakery can also make larger \u201cfamily\u201d boxes that hold a multiple of the smaller box size (for example, a family box could hold 21 cupcakes, which is a multiple of 7).\n\nTo figure out the biggest possible size for the small box that will still allow the cupcakes to be divided evenly, the bakery looks for the **greatest common factor (GCF)** of the total number of cupcakes (84) and a convenient multiple they might want to use (for instance, 42, because a family box could be two small boxes).  \n\n- The factors of 84 are: 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f7,\u202f12,\u202f14,\u202f21,\u202f28,\u202f42,\u202f84.  \n- The factors of 42 are: 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f6,\u202f7,\u202f14,\u202f21,\u202f42.  \n\nThe largest number appearing in both lists is **21** \u2013 that is the GCF of 84 and 42. (If we mistakenly thought the GCF were 12, we would end up with leftover cupcakes, showing how a small calculation slip can cause a practical problem.)\n\nBecause the GCF is 21, the bakery can pack the cupcakes into **21\u2011cupcake boxes** and still fill a \u201cfamily\u201d box that holds **42 cupcakes** (which is exactly two small boxes). This way:\n\n- All 84 cupcakes are used with no leftovers.\n- The number of boxes is minimized, saving packing material and time.\n- The larger family boxes are automatically a multiple of the smaller box size, making distribution to groups of students simple.\n\n**Why the GCF matters here**\n\nFinding the GCF lets the bakery choose the largest possible box size that still divides the total evenly, which maximizes efficiency and reduces waste. Whenever a total quantity must be split into equal, whole\u2011number groups that also need to fit into larger \u201cmultiple\u201d groups, the GCF of the total and the desired multiple tells you the optimal size. This same idea applies to things like cutting fabric into equal strips, arranging seats in rows for an event, or dividing a budget into equal project portions."
