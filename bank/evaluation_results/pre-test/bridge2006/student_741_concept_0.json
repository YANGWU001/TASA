  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of comparing multiplication results, correctly identifying larger products in most cases. However, they incorrectly stated that the products in Question 1 and Question 9 were equal, which indicates a misunderstanding of multiplication comparison. Overall, the student shows good grasp of the concept.",

      "student_answer": "\\(7 \\times 6 = 42\\)\n\n\\(8 \\times 5 = 40\\)\n\nSince \\(42 > 40\\), the product of 7 and 6 is larger than the product of 8 and 5."

      "student_answer": "The product \\(3 \\times 9 = 27\\).\n\nThe product \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\).\n\nSince \\(27 > 24\\), the larger product is **\\(3 \\times 9\\)**."
