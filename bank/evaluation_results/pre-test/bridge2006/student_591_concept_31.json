      "student_answer": "**How to find how many equal parts a rectangle is divided into when you draw\u202f4 vertical bars**\n\n1. **Draw the rectangle** \u2013 Sketch the shape you\u2019re working with. Make sure the long sides are horizontal; the short sides will be the top and bottom edges.\n\n2. **Place the vertical bars** \u2013 Draw the 4 vertical lines inside the rectangle so that they are **parallel to each other** and **perpendicular to the top and bottom edges**.  \n   - If the problem says the bars must be *equally spaced*, make sure the distance between each consecutive pair of bars is the same.\n   - If the bars are required to start and end exactly at the top and bottom edges, the bars will act as interior \u201cwalls\u201d that split the rectangle.\n\n3. **Count the spaces created** \u2013 Every time you add a new interior vertical bar you create **one extra region**.  \n   - With no bars you have 1 region (the whole rectangle).  \n   - Adding the first bar splits it into 2 regions.  \n   - Adding the second bar gives 3 regions, and so on.\n\n4. **Apply the \u201cbars\u202f+\u202f1\u201d rule** \u2013 The total number of equal divisions (columns) is simply  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of divisions} = \\text{Number of vertical bars} + 1.\n\\]\n\n   So for **4 vertical bars**:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Divisions} = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\\]\n\n5. **Verify equal spacing (if required)** \u2013 Measure the width of each of the 5 resulting columns. They should all be the same; if they aren\u2019t, adjust the positions of the bars until the widths match.\n\n**Result:** Using 4 equally\u2011spaced vertical bars inside a rectangle divides the shape into **5 equal vertical sections** (or columns)."

      "question": "If a rectangle is divided by 5 evenly spaced vertical bars, how many equal sections are formed?",
      "student_answer": "When 5 evenly\u2011spaced vertical bars are drawn across a rectangle, each bar creates a new division.  \nThus the number of equal sections (vertical strips) is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{sections} = \\text{bars} + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6.\n\\]\n\n**Answer: 6 equal sections.**"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain why placing 6 vertical bars in a rectangle results in 7 equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "When a rectangle is empty it is just **one** region.  \nEach time we draw a vertical bar (a straight line that runs from the top edge to the bottom edge) we split one of the existing regions into two.  \n\nSo the count goes like this:\n\n| Number of bars | Resulting regions (divisions) |\n|----------------|------------------------------|\n| 0 bars         | 1 region                     |\n| 1 bar          | 2 regions (left\u2011of\u2011bar, right\u2011of\u2011bar) |\n| 2 bars         | 3 regions (left of first, between the two, right of second) |\n| \u2026              | \u2026 |\n| 6 bars         | 7 regions |\n\nThe pattern is **\u201cbars\u202f+\u202f1 = divisions.\u201d**  \nWhy? After the first bar we have two sections. Adding a second bar cuts one of those sections into two, giving three total, and so on. After the sixth bar we have cut the previous six\u2011section layout once more, producing **seven** equal pieces.  \n\nThus, placing **six** evenly spaced vertical bars in a rectangle creates **seven** equal vertical divisions."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How does the number of vertical bars relate to the total number of equal divisions in a given shape?",
      "student_answer": "The vertical bars are the visual \u201ccut\u2011lines\u201d that split the shape into equal parts.  \nEach bar separates one part from the next, so the number of parts (the total number of equal divisions) is one more than the number of bars that are drawn inside the shape.\n\n**In formula form**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of equal divisions} = \\text{Number of vertical bars} + 1\n\\]\n\nFor example, if you see two vertical bars drawn inside a rectangle, they create three equal vertical slices; three bars would give four slices, and so on. (The only exception is when a bar is drawn on the outer edge of the shape\u2014then it doesn\u2019t add an extra division, but in the usual \u201cinside\u2011the\u2011shape\u201d presentation the rule above holds.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Illustrate with an example how placing 10 vertical bars in a square creates multiple equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "Imagine a square that is 10\u202fcm on each side.  \n\n1. Draw the top and bottom edges of the square.  \n2. Starting at the left\u2011hand side, draw a vertical line (a \u201cbar\u201d) at 1\u202fcm, then another at 2\u202fcm, then at 3\u202fcm, and so on until you have a line at 9\u202fcm.  \n3. Include the left\u2011most edge (0\u202fcm) and the right\u2011most edge (10\u202fcm) as the first and last \u201cbars.\u201d  \n\nNow you have **10 vertical bars** that are equally spaced (each 1\u202fcm apart).  \n\nThe space between any two consecutive bars\u2014whether it is between 0\u202fcm and 1\u202fcm, 1\u202fcm and 2\u202fcm, \u2026, or 9\u202fcm and 10\u202fcm\u2014forms a rectangle that is exactly the same size as every other rectangle. In other words, the square has been divided into **10 equal vertical strips**, each having a width of 1\u202fcm (or 1/10 of the total width of the square).\n\nSo, by placing 10 equally\u2011spaced vertical bars inside the square, we create multiple (in this case, ten) equal divisions of the original shape."
