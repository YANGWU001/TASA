      "student_answer": "**How to find the number of equal divisions created by 4 vertical bars in a rectangle**\n\n1. **Look at the bars** \u2013 The vertical bars run from the top edge of the rectangle to the bottom edge.  \n2. **Count the bars** \u2013 In this case you have 4 separate bars.  \n3. **Add one** \u2013 Each bar separates two regions, so the total number of vertical strips (equal divisions) is the number of bars\u202f+\u202f1.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Divisions} = 4\\;(\\text{bars}) + 1 = 5\n   \\]\n4. **Check the spacing** \u2013 To make sure the divisions are actually equal, measure the total width of the rectangle, then divide that width by the number of divisions (5). Each space between successive bars\u2014and the space from the left edge to the first bar and from the last bar to the right edge\u2014should be this same width.\n5. **Confirm** \u2013 If each of the five strips has the same width, you have correctly identified **5 equal divisions** created by the 4 vertical bars."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain why placing 6 vertical bars in a rectangle results in 7 equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "When you draw vertical bars (straight lines) inside a rectangle, each bar separates the space into two parts: the region to its left and the region to its right.  \n\nIf you start with an empty rectangle, there is **one** whole region.  \nAdding the **first** vertical bar splits that one region into **two** regions.  \nAdding a **second** vertical bar splits one of the existing regions (the one that lies between the first bar and the right edge) into two more, giving you **three** regions in total.  \n\nEach additional bar always creates one new region, because it only cuts the single region that lies immediately to its right (or left) into two pieces. Therefore:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of regions (equal divisions)} = \\text{Number of bars} + 1\n\\]\n\nSo with **6** vertical bars you have:\n\n\\[\n6 \\text{ bars} + 1 = 7 \\text{ equal divisions}\n\\]\n\nVisually, the rectangle is divided into seven vertical strips: one strip before the first bar, five strips between successive bars, and one strip after the last bar. All strips have the same width because the bars are placed equally spaced."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How does the number of vertical bars relate to the total number of equal divisions in a given shape?",
      "student_answer": "The vertical bars are the visual cue that tells you how many equal pieces the shape has been split into.  \nIn most of the worksheets we use, **each bar marks one of the equal parts** \u2013 so if you count\u202fN\u202fvertical bars, you have\u202fN\u202fequal divisions.\n\n(Occasionally a teacher will draw the bars as the *boundaries* between pieces, in which case the total number of parts is\u202fN\u202f+\u202f1. But in the standard \u201ccount\u2011the\u2011bars\u201d tasks the bars themselves represent the pieces, so the count of bars gives the exact number of equal divisions.)"

      "student_answer": "The rectangle was divided into 8 equal vertical strips, so **7 vertical bars** are needed."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Illustrate with an example how placing 10 vertical bars in a square creates multiple equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "**Example**\n\nTake a square whose side\u2011length is 10\u202fcm.  \nDraw 10 vertical bars (thin straight lines) inside the square and space them **evenly**.  \n\nOne way to do this is to place the first bar 1\u202fcm from the left edge, the next bar 2\u202fcm from the left edge, and so on, until the last (10th) bar is 10\u202fcm from the left edge (right on the border).  \n\nBecause the bars are equally spaced, the distance between any two adjacent bars is the same:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{spacing}= \\frac{10\\text{\u202fcm}}{10}=1\\text{\u202fcm}.\n\\]\n\nThus the square is divided into **10 equal vertical strips**, each 1\u202fcm wide (the outermost strip is bounded by the left edge and the first bar, the next strip is between the first and second bars, etc.).  \n\nSo, by placing 10 vertical bars at regular 1\u2011cm intervals inside a 10\u2011cm\u2011by\u201110\u2011cm square, we create multiple (in this case 10) equal divisions of the square."
