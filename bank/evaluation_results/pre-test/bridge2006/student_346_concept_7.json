  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of comparing sums, correctly identifying larger quantities in most cases. However, there were a few errors, particularly in questions 1, 3, and 6, indicating some confusion with basic addition and comparison. Encouraging careful calculation and verification of sums could improve accuracy.",
