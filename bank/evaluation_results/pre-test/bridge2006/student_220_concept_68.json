      "student_answer": "**Steps for finding the total (sum) of a group of numbers**\n\n1. **Write the numbers down** \u2013 Put all the numbers you want to total in a list (or on a piece of paper or in a spreadsheet).  \n\n2. **Arrange them (optional)** \u2013 It can be helpful to line the numbers up by place value (units, tens, hundreds, \u2026) so that you don\u2019t miss any digits when you add.  (You don\u2019t have to sort them from smallest to largest; it\u2019s just for clarity.)\n\n3. **Add the first two numbers** \u2013 Take the first number and add it to the second number.  Write down the result.\n\n4. **Add the next number to the running total** \u2013 Take the result you just got and add the third number to it.  Keep doing this, one number at a time, until you have added every number in the list.\n\n5. **Carry/borrow as needed** \u2013 When a column adds up to 10 or more, carry the extra digit to the next column (just like ordinary addition).  Check each column carefully so you don\u2019t miss a carry.\n\n6. **Check your work** \u2013 You can double\u2011check the total by:\n   - Adding the numbers in a different order (the sum should be the same).\n   - Using a calculator or spreadsheet to verify the result.\n   - (Sometimes people also divide the sum by the count to get an average, but that\u2019s a different calculation.)\n\n7. **Write down the final sum** \u2013 The number you end up with after the last addition is the total of the whole group.\n\n**In short:** list the numbers, add them one by one (keeping track of carries), and verify the result.  That final number is the total."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How does rounding individual numbers affect the accuracy of calculating their total?",
      "student_answer": "Rounding each\u202findividual\u202fnumber before you add them usually makes the final sum a little less exact.  When you round, you introduce a small \u201cround\u2011off\u201d error for each number \u2013 for example, rounding\u202f2.46\u202fto\u202f2.5\u202fadds\u202f+0.04, while rounding\u202f3.73\u202fto\u202f3.7\u202fadds\u202f\u20110.03.  If you add up the rounded values, those little errors can pile up, so the total you compute can be off by roughly the sum of the individual rounding errors.  \n\nIn many cases the errors will partially cancel (a\u202f+0.04\u202fmight be offset by a\u202f\u20110.03\u202f), which can make the total look pretty close to the true total.  But if most of the numbers are rounded in the same direction, the errors add together and the total can end up noticeably higher or lower than the exact sum.  \n\nSo, rounding individual numbers tends to reduce the precision of the total; the amount of inaccuracy is roughly the combined size of the separate round\u2011off errors (often a few hundredths or tenths, depending on how many numbers you have and how aggressively you round).  In short, the more you round, the more chance there is for the total to drift away from the true value."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "What is the difference between calculating total and calculating average in a dataset?",
      "student_answer": "I think the main difference is that **calculating the total** just adds up every number in the data set, giving you the overall sum.  \n\n**Calculating the average** (or mean) also starts with that sum, but then you divide it by the number of items in the set to get a typical or \u201cmiddle\u2011of\u2011the\u2011road\u201d value. In other words, the average tells you what each item would be worth if the total were spread evenly across all of them."
