  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of counting shaded parts in circles, correctly answering most questions. However, there were some misunderstandings regarding the definition of contiguous parts, particularly in Questions 4 and 5. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of basic concepts but needs to clarify the definition of contiguous shading.",
