It is the smallest positive integer that each of the original integers divides evenly. This concept is useful, for example, when finding a common denominator for fractions or synchronizing cycles that repeat at different intervals."

There is no smaller way to do this, because omitting either factor would make the number fail to be a multiple of that prime. Hence the smallest such number is simply the product of the two primes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(p,q)=p\\times q .\n\\]\n\n(And even if the two primes happen to be the same, the LCM still ends up being \\(p \\times p = p^{2}\\), because we need the prime factor at the highest power that appears\u2014in this case \\(p^{2}\\).)"
