  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of comparing products through multiplication, correctly identifying larger quantities in most cases. However, there were two instances (Questions 1 and 9) where the student incorrectly stated that the products were equal, which indicates a misunderstanding of the comparison concept. Overall, the student shows good proficiency in multiplication and comparison.",
