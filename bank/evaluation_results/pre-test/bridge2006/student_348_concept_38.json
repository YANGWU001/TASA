      "question": "Describe how you would divide a circle into 5 equal sections.",
      "student_answer": "To split a circle into five equal parts you need five central angles that are each\u202f360\u00b0\u202f\u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f72\u00b0.  One simple way to do this is:\n\n1. **Find the centre** of the circle and mark it as point\u202fO.  \n2. **Draw a radius** from O to any point on the circumference \u2013 call this point\u202fA.  This will be the first dividing line.  \n3. **Set a protractor** (or a drafting compass with a degree\u2011scale) on point\u202fO with the 0\u00b0 mark aligned with line\u202fOA.  \n4. **Mark the next angle** at 72\u00b0 from OA; label the intersection on the circle as\u202fB.  Draw the line\u202fOB.  \n5. **Repeat** the same step: from the 72\u00b0 line, measure another 72\u00b0 (i.e., 144\u00b0 from the start) and label that point\u202fC; draw\u202fOC.  \n6. Continue measuring 72\u00b0 increments (216\u00b0, 288\u00b0) to get points\u202fD and\u202fE on the circumference, drawing lines\u202fOD,\u202fOE each time.  \n\nYou will now have five radii OA,\u202fOB,\u202fOC,\u202fOD,\u202fOE that are spaced equally around the centre, creating five congruent sectors (each sector\u2019s central angle is 72\u00b0).  \n\n**Alternative construction (no protractor):**  \n- Inscribe a regular pentagon in the circle (using a compass\u2011and\u2011straightedge construction).  \n- Connect the centre O to each vertex of the pentagon.  \n- The five lines from O to the pentagon\u2019s vertices automatically divide the circle into five equal 72\u00b0 sectors.  \n\nEither method gives you the required five equal sections of the circle."

      "student_answer": "**How to divide a circle into equal sections**\n\n1. **Decide how many sections you need.**  \n   Let this number be\u202f\\(n\\).\n\n2. **Find the central angle for each section.**  \n   A full circle is 360\u00b0, so the angle between two consecutive radii that bound a section is  \n\n   \\[\n   \\text{central angle} = \\frac{360^\\circ}{n}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Mark the first radius.**  \n   Usually you start with a horizontal radius (pointing to the right) or any convenient reference line.\n\n4. **Use a protractor (or a compass\u2011and\u2011straightedge construction) to step off the central angle.**  \n   - Place the protractor\u2019s center at the circle\u2019s centre.  \n   - From the reference radius, measure the central angle clockwise (or counter\u2011clockwise) and draw a new radius through the point you mark on the circumference.  \n   - Repeat this step, always measuring the same central angle from the last radius you drew.\n\n5. **Continue until you have drawn \\(n\\) radii.**  \n   The radii will partition the circle into \\(n\\) equal \u201cpie\u2011slice\u201d pieces, each bounded by two consecutive radii.\n\n6. **(Optional) Check your work.**  \n   The sum of all central angles should be 360\u00b0, and the endpoints of the last radius should coincide with the starting point.\n\n---\n\n**Example: 9 equal divisions**\n\n*Step\u202f1:*\u202f\\(n = 9\\).\n\n*Step\u202f2:*\u202fCalculate the central angle:\n\n\\[\n\\text{central angle} = \\frac{360^\\circ}{9} = 40^\\circ.\n\\]\n\n*Step\u202f3\u20135:*\u202fStarting from a reference radius, use a protractor to draw a radius at 40\u00b0, then another at 80\u00b0, then 120\u00b0, and so on, until you have drawn nine radii. The last radius will land back at the starting line (9\u202f\u00d7\u202f40\u00b0\u202f=\u202f360\u00b0), confirming the division is correct.\n\n**Result:** Each of the 9 sections has a central angle of **40 degrees**, and the circle is now split into nine equal parts."
