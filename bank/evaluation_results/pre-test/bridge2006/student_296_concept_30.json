      "student_answer": "Um, I think the greatest common factor of 24 and 36 is 12, so you could make **12** equal groups.  (Each group would have 2 apples and 3 oranges.)"

      "question": "Explain how the GCF helps in dividing items into equal groups.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the greatest common factor (GCF) is useful because it tells you the biggest size that can be used for each group when you\u2019re trying to split a collection of items into a bunch of equal piles.  \n\nSo, if you have two numbers of objects \u2013 say\u202f12\u202fmarbles and\u202f18\u202fcoins \u2013 you look for the GCF of\u202f12\u202fand\u202f18, which is\u202f6. That means you could make groups of\u202f6\u202fstuff and each group would have the same number of items from both sets. In other words, you could line up the marbles in groups of\u202f6\u202f(so you get\u202f2\u202fgroups) and the coins in groups of\u202f6\u202f(so you get\u202f3\u202fgroups), and each group would be \u201cequal\u201d in the sense that they all contain\u202f6\u202fitems.  \n\nBecause the GCF is the largest number that divides both original amounts without leftovers, it gives you the \u201cbiggest possible\u201d equal\u2011size groups you can make. If you tried a smaller number, you could still make equal groups, but they\u2019d be smaller than necessary, and you might end up with more groups than you really need.  \n\nSo basically, the GCF helps you figure out the biggest chunk you can use to break the items into equal groups, which makes the division neat and avoids any leftover pieces."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the greatest common factor of 45 and 60 is **5**.  So if we try to split the numbers into equal groups, each group would have **5 items** (that would give about 9 groups for the 45 items and 12 groups for the 60 items)."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "What is the GCF of 16, 24, and 40? How many groups can be formed with this GCF?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the greatest common factor of 16,\u202f24, and\u202f40 might be **4**.  \nIf we use 4 as the group size, then the numbers could be split into:\n\n* 16\u202f\u00f7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f4 groups  \n* 24\u202f\u00f7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f6 groups  \n* 40\u202f\u00f7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f10 groups  \n\nSo maybe you could make **4\u2011item groups**, giving you 4, 6, and 10 groups respectively.  I\u2019m not completely sure, though\u2026"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one real\u2011life place you could use the GCF is when you\u2019re trying to make gift bags with the same number of items.  For example, say you have 30 pencils and 45 pens and you want every bag to have the same mix of pencils and pens.  You\u2019d find the greatest common factor of 30 and 45 \u2013 which I think is 5 \u2013 and then you could make 5 identical bags.  Each bag would then get\u202f30\u202f\u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f6 pencils and\u202f45\u202f\u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f9 pens.  That way all the bags are evenly packed.  (I\u2019m not totally sure about the exact number, but the idea is that the GCF tells you the biggest number of equal groups you can make.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the greatest common factor of 72 and 90 is **6**.  \n\nThe GCF is the biggest number that can go into both numbers without leaving a remainder, so if we try to make groups of items, the largest size of each group that would let us divide both 72 and 90 evenly would be 6 items per group. That means we could make 12 groups of 6 from the 72 items and 15 groups of 6 from the 90 items.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
