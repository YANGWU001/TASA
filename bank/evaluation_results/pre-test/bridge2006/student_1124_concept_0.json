  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of multiplication and comparison of products, correctly identifying larger quantities in most cases. However, they made errors in questions 1, 6, and 8, indicating a misunderstanding of equality and comparison in those instances. Overall, they show a solid grasp of the concept.",
