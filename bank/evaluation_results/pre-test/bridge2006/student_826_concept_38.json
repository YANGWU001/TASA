      "question": "Describe how you would divide a circle into 5 equal sections.",
      "student_answer": "To cut a circle into five equal parts you need five sectors that each subtend the same central angle.  \nBecause the whole circle is\u202f360\u00b0, each sector must have an angle of  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{360^\\circ}{5}=72^\\circ .\n\\]\n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step method (using a protractor):**\n\n1. **Draw the circle** and clearly mark its centre \\(O\\).  \n2. **Draw an initial radius** \u2013 a straight line from \\(O\\) to any point on the circumference. Call this point \\(A\\).  \n3. **Place the protractor** with its centre hole over \\(O\\) and the baseline aligned with the line \\(OA\\).  \n4. **Mark the next point** on the circumference at \\(72^\\circ\\) from \\(OA\\). Label this point \\(B\\).  \n5. **Repeat**: without moving the protractor, rotate it so that its baseline now lies along \\(OB\\) and mark another point \\(C\\) at another \\(72^\\circ\\). Continue this process until you have points \\(D\\) and \\(E\\) each \\(72^\\circ\\) apart from the previous one.  \n6. **Connect each point** \\(A, B, C, D, E\\) back to the centre \\(O\\) with straight lines. The five radii \\(OA, OB, OC, OD, OE\\) divide the circle into five equal sectors.\n\n**Alternative method (using a compass only):**\n\n1. Draw the circle and its centre \\(O\\).  \n2. Choose any point \\(A\\) on the circumference and set the compass to the radius of the circle.  \n3. With the compass point on \\(A\\), swing an arc that cuts the circumference at a new point \\(B\\).  \n4. Keeping the same compass width, place the point on \\(B\\) and swing another arc to get point \\(C\\).  \n5. Continue this \u201cstepping\u2011off\u201d process until you return to the starting point after exactly five marks (the arcs will be equal because they all equal the chord length for a 72\u00b0 central angle).  \n6. Draw radii from \\(O\\) to each of the five points.\n\nEither approach yields five congruent sectors, each covering \\(72^\\circ\\) of the circle, which is the definition of dividing the circle into five equal sections."

Each measurement gives the next radius, which together with the centre forms the next boundary of a section.  \n6. **Repeat until you return to the starting point** \u2013 After \\(n\\) steps you will have drawn \\(n\\) radii that divide the circle into \\(n\\) equal slices.\n\n---\n\n### Example: 9 equal divisions\n\n- **Number of sections:** \\(n = 9\\)  \n- **Central angle for each section:**  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{360^\\circ}{9}=40^\\circ\n  \\]\n  (In radians this would be \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{9}\\approx 0.698\\)\u202frad.)\n\n**Procedure**\n\n1. Draw a radius from the centre to any point on the circumference.  \n2. Using a protractor (or a compass\u2011based construction), mark a point **40\u00b0** away from that radius. Draw a second radius to that point.  \n3. Continue measuring 40\u00b0 from the last radius and drawing a new radius, repeating this step until you have drawn 9 radii.  \n4. The 9 radii now partition the circle into 9 congruent sectors, each with a central angle of **40\u00b0**.\n\nThus, dividing a circle into 9 equal parts yields an angle of **40 degrees** (or about **0.698 radians**) for each section."
