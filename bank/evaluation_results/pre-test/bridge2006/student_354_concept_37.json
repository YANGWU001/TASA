      "student_answer": "The square is split into 9 equal parts (a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid). Since exactly three of those parts are shaded and they are contiguous, the total number of shaded sections is simply the three that were colored. \n\n**Answer: 3**"

      "student_answer": "The square has 12 parts in total.\u202fIf 6 of those parts are shaded, the remaining parts are unshaded:\n\n\\[\n12 \\text{ total parts} - 6 \\text{ shaded parts} = 6 \\text{ unshaded parts}\n\\]\n\n**Answer: 6 unshaded parts**"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "A square is divided into 10 parts. If 3 non-contiguous sections are shaded, how many contiguous shaded parts are there?",
      "student_answer": "Since the three shaded sections are non\u2011contiguous, none of them touch one another.  \nEach isolated shaded section forms its own contiguous region.  \n\nTherefore, the number of contiguous shaded parts is **3**."

      "question": "If a square is split into 4 parts and all parts are shaded, count the total number of shaded parts.",
      "student_answer": "The square is divided into\u202f4\u202fequal parts, and each part is shaded.  \nTherefore, the total number of shaded parts is **4**."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "A square is divided into 36 parts, and 12 contiguous sections are shaded. How many shaded parts are there?",
      "student_answer": "The 12 shaded sections are all touching one another, so they form a single connected (contiguous) region.  \nTherefore, the number of shaded parts (i.e., distinct contiguous shaded regions) is **1**."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a square is split into 6 equal sections, and 2 adjacent shaded sections are identified, how many shaded parts are present?",
      "student_answer": "The two shaded sections are adjacent, so they form a single contiguous region.  \n**Number of shaded parts: 1**"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "A square is divided into 15 parts, and 7 contiguous shaded areas are visible. How many shaded areas are there in total?",
      "student_answer": "The square is divided into 15 individual sections.  \nThe problem states that **7 of those sections form one contiguous (connected) shaded region** \u2013 i.e., the 7 shaded parts are all touching each other.\n\nSince the question asks for the total number of shaded areas (the number of individual shaded sections), the answer is simply the count of those shaded sections:\n\n**There are 7 shaded areas in total.**"
