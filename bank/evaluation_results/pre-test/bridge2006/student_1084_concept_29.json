  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of GCF, particularly when one number is a multiple of the other. Most answers are correct, but there was a mistake in the prime factorization method for Question 4, where the GCF should have been 15 instead of 3. Overall, the student effectively explains the reasoning behind the GCF and provides relevant real-life applications.",

      "student_answer": "The idea is that when you have a number\u202f\\(a\\) and a second number that is a multiple of\u202f\\(a\\) (let\u2019s call it\u202f\\(b\\)), you can write the larger one as\u202f\\(b = k\\cdot a\\) for some whole\u2011number\u202f\\(k\\).  \n\nBecause\u202f\\(a\\) divides\u202f\\(b\\) exactly (there\u2019s no remainder), every divisor of\u202f\\(a\\) will also divide\u202f\\(b\\).  In other words, the set of common factors of the two numbers is exactly the set of factors of the smaller number\u202f\\(a\\).  The greatest of those common factors can\u2019t be bigger than\u202f\\(a\\) itself, so it must be\u202f\\(a\\) (or a factor of\u202f\\(a\\) if\u202f\\(a\\) isn\u2019t the smallest \u2013 but since\u202f\\(a\\) is the smaller of the two numbers, the biggest common factor is just\u202f\\(a\\)).  \n\nSo the GCF of a number and any of its multiples is just the smaller number, because the smaller number already divides the larger one completely and therefore is the biggest factor they share.  \n\n*(I think this is why the GCF ends up being the smaller number; the larger number doesn\u2019t add any new common factors beyond those of the smaller.)*"

      "question": "How can you determine the GCF of two numbers where one is a multiple of the other without fully factoring both numbers?",
      "student_answer": "If one of the numbers is a **multiple of the other**, you don\u2019t have to break both numbers down into all of their prime factors.  \nThe key idea is that the smaller number already **divides** the larger one, so it is automatically a common factor. Because any other factor of the smaller number also divides the larger (since the larger is just the smaller\u202f\u00d7\u202fsome integer), the **greatest** common factor can\u2019t be bigger than the smaller number itself.  \n\nSo, in most cases you can just:\n\n1. **Identify the smaller of the two numbers.**  \n2. **Check that the larger number is divisible by the smaller** (usually obvious if you\u2019re told it\u2019s a multiple).  \n3. **Conclude that the GCF is the smaller number.**  \n\nIf you want to be extra sure, you can run a quick Euclidean\u2011algorithm step: divide the larger number by the smaller; the remainder will be\u202f0, confirming that the smaller number is the greatest common divisor.\n\n*(I think this works for any pair where one is a clear multiple of the other, though if the problem somehow hides a larger common factor than the smaller number, you might need to double\u2011check with the Euclidean algorithm.)*"

      "student_answer": "One everyday situation where you might want the greatest common factor of a number and one of its multiples is when you\u2019re packing or arranging items so that nothing has to be cut or left over.\n\nImagine you have **24** stickers that you want to put into packets, and you also need to make enough packets for a larger order that is a multiple of that amount\u2014say **60** stickers total.  \nTo decide how many stickers should go in each packet so that both the small batch (24 stickers) and the larger batch (60 stickers) can be divided evenly, you can find the GCF of the two numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{GCF}(24,\\;60)=12.\n\\]\n\nBecause the GCF is 12, you could make packets that each contain **12 stickers**.  \n\n- The 24\u2011sticker batch would fill **\\(24 \u00f7 12 = 2\\)** packets.  \n- The 60\u2011sticker batch would fill **\\(60 \u00f7 12 = 5\\)** packets.\n\nUsing the GCF this way means you never have a packet that\u2019s partially filled; everything is grouped into whole packets of the same size.  \n\nIn short, the GCF of a number and its multiple helps you choose the largest possible group size (or \u201cpackage size\u201d) that works for both the smaller and larger quantities, which is handy for things like packaging, arranging tiles, or dividing supplies evenly."
