Since \\(a\\) is the largest divisor of itself, no integer larger than \\(a\\) can divide \\(a\\). Therefore nothing bigger than \\(a\\) can be a common factor of the pair.\n\nPutting these observations together, the set of common factors of \\(a\\) and its multiple \\(b\\) is exactly the set of divisors of \\(a\\). The greatest element of that set is \\(a\\) itself.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nThe greatest common factor (GCF) of a number and any of its multiples is always the smaller number because the smaller number\u2019s divisors automatically divide the larger (multiple) number, and nothing larger than the smaller number can divide it. Hence the GCF equals the smaller number."

If the remainder is\u202f0, then \\(a\\) is a multiple of \\(b\\).  \n3. **Conclude:**  \n   - If the remainder is\u202f0, \\(\\text{GCF}(a,b)=b\\).  \n   - If the remainder is not\u202f0, the numbers are not in a simple \u201cmultiple\u201d relationship, and you would need the usual methods (e.g., Euclidean algorithm) to find the GCF.\n\n**Example**\n\nFind the GCF of 48 and 180.\n\n- 48\u202f<\u202f180, so test whether 180 \u00f7 48 leaves a remainder.  \n- \\(180 \u00f7 48 = 3\\) remainder\u202f36 \u2192 not a clean multiple.  \n- Since 48 is *not* a divisor of 180, we cannot use the shortcut and must apply the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nNow consider 36 and 144.\n\n- 36\u202f<\u202f144, and \\(144 \u00f7 36 = 4\\) with remainder\u202f0.  \n- Because 144 is a multiple of 36, the GCF is the smaller number: **36**.\n\nThus, when one number is a multiple of the other, you can skip full prime\u2011factor listings and immediately state that the GCF is the smaller (divisor) number."

      "student_answer": "A practical situation where you need the greatest common factor (GCF) of a number and one of its multiples is when you\u2019re **organizing items into equal groups without leftovers**\u2014for example, planning how to pack boxes for a shipment.\n\n**Scenario:**  \nA bakery bakes 240 cupcakes each day. They want to ship the cupcakes in identical boxes, each holding the same number of cupcakes, and they also want each box to be a multiple of the standard \u201cparty package\u201d size of 12 cupcakes (so each box can be broken down into complete party packages if needed).  \n\n**How the GCF helps:**  \n- The total number of cupcakes (240) is a multiple of the box\u2011size they\u2019ll choose.  \n- To find the *largest possible* box size that still divides evenly into both the total count (240) and the party\u2011package size (12), you compute the GCF of 240 and 12.  \n\n\\[\n\\text{GCF}(240,12)=12\n\\]\n\nSo the biggest box that works is one that holds **12 cupcakes**. Using this box size:\n\n- 240 \u00f7 12 = 20 boxes, so every box is full.  \n- Each box already matches the party\u2011package size, so the bakery can ship whole boxes directly to customers or, if desired, keep the boxes and later rearrange them into larger groupings without any leftover cupcakes.\n\n**Why the GCF is useful here:**  \n- It guarantees the largest uniform group size that fits both constraints (the total quantity and the required multiple).  \n- It maximizes efficiency by reducing the number of boxes needed while still meeting the packaging rule.  \n\nIn any similar real\u2011life context\u2014like arranging chairs in rows, cutting fabric into strips, or loading pallets with items\u2014the GCF of a quantity and its multiple tells you the biggest unit size you can use to keep everything perfectly divisible, eliminating waste and simplifying logistics."
