Since 95\u00b0 is greater than 90\u00b0 and still well below 180\u00b0, it falls into the obtuse category."

      "student_answer": "An **obtuse angle** is any angle that measures **greater than 90\u00b0 but less than 180\u00b0**. It opens wider than a right angle.\n\nA **right angle** is an angle that measures **exactly 90\u00b0**. It is the angle formed by two perpendicular lines (e.g., the corner of a square or a piece of paper).\n\n**Key differences**\n- **Measure**:\u202fObtuse\u202f>\u202f90\u00b0\u202fand\u202f<\u202f180\u00b0;\u202fRight\u202f=\u202f90\u00b0.\n- **Appearance**:\u202fAn obtuse angle looks \u201cwide\u201d or \u201copen,\u201d while a right angle looks like a perfect \u201cL\u201d shape.\n- **Geometric role**:\u202fRight angles are used to define perpendicularity and many shapes (squares, rectangles). Obtuse angles appear in shapes such as obtuse triangles and certain polygons."

      "question": "A triangle has one angle measuring 110 degrees. Is this angle obtuse?",
      "student_answer": "Yes. An obtuse angle is any angle greater than\u202f90\u00b0 but less than\u202f180\u00b0. Since 110\u00b0 falls in that range, the given angle is obtuse."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Can an obtuse angle ever measure more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "No.  \n\nBy definition an **obtuse angle** is an angle whose measure is **greater than 90\u00b0 but less than 180\u00b0**.  \nAngles in the plane are measured from 0\u00b0 up to 180\u00b0 (a straight angle). Any angle larger than 180\u00b0 is called a **reflex angle**, not an obtuse one. Therefore an obtuse angle can never exceed 180\u00b0."
