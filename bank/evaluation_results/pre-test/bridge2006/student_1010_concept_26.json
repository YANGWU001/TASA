      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) of a set of integers is the **largest positive integer that divides each of the numbers exactly (with no remainder)**.  \n\nIn other words, it is the biggest number that all of the given integers share as a factor.  \n\n**Why it matters**\n\n- **Simplifying fractions:** Dividing the numerator and denominator by their GCF reduces the fraction to its lowest terms.  \n- **Factoring expressions:** When factoring polynomials or whole numbers, pulling out the GCF is the first step because it reveals a common multiple that can be taken outside a product.  \n- **Solving problems:** Many word\u2011problem contexts (e.g., arranging items into equal groups) rely on the GCF to determine the largest possible group size.\n\nSo, the GCF represents the greatest shared divisor among the numbers, highlighting the strongest common \u201cbuilding block\u201d they have in common."
