The smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is therefore \\(a\\) itself, because:\n\n* \\(a\\) is a multiple of \\(a\\) (trivially).  \n* Since \\(a = k\\,b\\), \\(a\\) is also a multiple of \\(b\\).\n\nHence the least common multiple (LCM) of the two numbers cannot be smaller than \\(a\\); it is exactly the larger number \\(a\\).  \n\n(Example: for 4 and 12, 12\u202f=\u202f3\u00b74, and the LCM(4,\u202f12)\u202f=\u202f12.)"

      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of 15 and 45 is **45**.\n\n**Why this is easy when one number is a multiple of the other**\n\n- Notice that **45 = 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f15**.  \n  This means 45 is already a multiple of 15.\n- When one of the two numbers is a multiple of the other, the larger number automatically contains all the prime factors needed to be a common multiple.\n- Therefore the smallest (least) common multiple can\u2019t be any smaller than the larger number itself, and it certainly can\u2019t be larger than that because the larger number already works.\n\nSo, instead of going through the usual factor\u2011by\u2011factor or listing\u2011multiples method, we can simply state:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(15,45) = 45.\n\\]"
