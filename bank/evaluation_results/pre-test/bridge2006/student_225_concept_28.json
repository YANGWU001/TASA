      "student_answer": "**Prime factors** are the factors of a number that are *prime numbers*\u2014numbers greater than\u202f1 that have no divisors other than\u202f1 and themselves. When a number is broken down into its prime factors, you are expressing it as a product of primes (its *prime factorization*).\n\n**Regular (or ordinary) factors** are *all* positive integers that divide the number exactly, whether they are prime or composite. In other words, every factor of the number is a regular factor, but only those that are prime are called prime factors.\n\n**Example:**  \nTake the number\u202f60.\n\n- **Prime factors of 60:** 2,\u202f3,\u202f5 (and their multiplicities: \\(60 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5\\)).  \n- **Regular factors of 60:** 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f5,\u202f6,\u202f10,\u202f12,\u202f15,\u202f20,\u202f30,\u202f60.\n\nSo, the key difference is that prime factors are a subset of the regular factors\u2014specifically the ones that are prime numbers\u2014while regular factors include every divisor of the number, prime or composite."

      "question": "How can you use divisibility rules to efficiently list factors of a large number?",
      "student_answer": "**Using divisibility rules to speed up the factor\u2011listing process**\n\n1. **Start with the easy \u201cquick\u2011check\u201d rules**  \n   * **Even numbers** \u2013 if the last digit is\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6 or\u202f8 the number is divisible by\u202f2.  \n   * **Divisible by\u202f5** \u2013 if the last digit is\u202f0 or\u202f5.  \n   * **Divisible by\u202f3 or\u202f9** \u2013 add all the digits; if the sum is a multiple of\u202f3 (or\u202f9) the original number is divisible by\u202f3 (or\u202f9).  \n   * **Divisible by\u202f11** \u2013 subtract the sum of the digits in odd positions from the sum of the digits in even positions; if the result is a multiple of\u202f11 (including\u202f0), the number is divisible by\u202f11.\n\n   Apply these rules first; every divisor you find cuts the size of the remaining quotient and immediately gives you a pair of factors (the divisor and the co\u2011factor).\n\n2. **Move on to the \u201cmedium\u2011difficulty\u201d rules**  \n   * **Divisible by\u202f4** \u2013 the last two digits form a number divisible by\u202f4.  \n   * **Divisible by\u202f8** \u2013 the last three digits form a number divisible by\u202f8.  \n   * **Divisible by\u202f7** \u2013 double the last digit, subtract it from the rest of the number; if the result is a multiple of\u202f7, the original number is divisible by\u202f7. (This rule works repeatedly until a small, recognizable multiple appears.)\n\n3. **Factor out what you\u2019ve found**  \n   Each time a divisor\u202f\\(d\\) passes a rule, divide the original number\u202f\\(N\\) by\u202f\\(d\\) to obtain a smaller co\u2011factor\u202f\\(c = N/d\\).  \n   * Record the pair \\((d,\\;c)\\).  \n   * Replace \\(N\\) with the smaller of the two numbers and repeat the divisibility checks on that new value.  \n   * Continue until the remainder is 1 or a prime that fails all the rules you\u2019ve used.\n\n4. **Build the full list from the prime\u2011factorisation**  \n   After you have stripped away every divisor that passed a rule, you will have a prime\u2011factorisation of the original number, e.g.\n\n   \\[\n   N = 2^{a}\\,3^{b}\\,5^{c}\\,7^{d}\\,\\dots\n   \\]\n\n   The total number of factors is \\((a+1)(b+1)(c+1)(d+1)\\dots\\).  \n   Generate every factor by taking all possible exponent combinations:\n   \\[\n   \\text{factor} = 2^{i}\\,3^{j}\\,5^{k}\\,7^{\\ell}\\dots\\quad\\text{where }0\\le i\\le a,\\;0\\le j\\le b,\\dots\n   \\]\n\n5. **Use factor\u2011pair symmetry to halve the work**  \n   Once you have a factor\u202f\\(f\\) that is \u2264\u202f\u221aN, its partner\u202f\\(N/f\\) is automatically a factor >\u202f\u221aN. Listing only the smaller half and mirroring gives the complete set without redundant checks.\n\n---\n\n### Example (illustrative)\n\nFind the factors of \\(N = 2\\,130\\).\n\n| Step | Rule applied | Result | Quotient |\n|------|--------------|--------|----------|\n| 1    | Even (last digit\u202f0) | 2 divides \\(2130\\) | \\(2130 \u00f7 2 = 1065\\) |\n| 2    | Divisible by\u202f5 (last digit\u202f5) | 5 divides \\(1065\\) | \\(1065 \u00f7 5 = 213\\) |\n| 3    | Divisible by\u202f3 (digit\u2011sum\u202f2+1+3 = 6) | 3 divides \\(213\\) | \\(213 \u00f7 3 = 71\\) |\n| 4    | 71 fails 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11 \u2013 it is prime | stop | \u2013 |\n\nPrime\u2011factorisation: \\(2130 = 2^{1}\\,3^{1}\\,5^{1}\\,71^{1}\\).\n\nNumber of factors: \\((1+1)^4 = 16\\).\n\nAll factors are obtained by combining the exponents:\n\n\\[\n\\{1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30,71,142,213,355,426,710,1065,2130\\}.\n\\]\n\nBecause we used divisibility rules first, we never needed to test every integer up to\u202f\u221a2130\u202f\u2248\u202f46; we identified the prime factors quickly and then generated the complete list mechanically.\n\n---\n\n### Quick checklist for a large \\(N\\)\n\n1. **Check 2,\u202f5,\u202f10** (last digit).  \n2. **Check 3,\u202f9** (digit\u2011sum).  \n3. **Check 4,\u202f8** (last two/three digits).  \n4. **Check 11** (alternating\u2011sum).  \n5. **Check 7** (double\u2011last\u2011digit rule).  \n6. **Divide out each successful divisor**, recording the co\u2011factor.  \n7. **When the remaining quotient is prime or 1, stop**.  \n8. **Generate all factor combinations** from the prime\u2011factor list.  \n\nBy following these rules you dramatically cut down the number of trial divisions and can list the factors of even very large numbers with a systematic, low\u2011effort approach."
