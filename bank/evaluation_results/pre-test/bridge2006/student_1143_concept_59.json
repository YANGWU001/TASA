      "question": "What makes a fraction improper?",
      "student_answer": "A fraction is called **improper** when its numerator is at least as large as its denominator (in absolute value). In other words, if  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\quad\\text{with }b\\neq0,\n\\]\n\nand \\(|a| \\ge |b|\\), then the fraction\u2019s value is \\(\\ge 1\\) (or \\(\\le -1\\) for negative numbers). Such fractions can be written as a mixed number or an integer plus a proper fraction.  \n\nSo the key condition: **numerator\u202f\u2265\u202fdenominator (by magnitude)** makes a fraction improper."

      "student_answer": "\\( \\displaystyle \\frac{11}{10} \\) is called an **improper fraction** because its numerator (11) is larger than its denominator (10).  \n\nA fraction is classified as:\n\n- **Proper** when the numerator is **less** than the denominator, giving a value **less than 1**.  \n- **Improper** when the numerator is **equal to or greater** than the denominator, giving a value **greater than or equal to 1**.\n\nSince \\(11 > 10\\), the fraction represents a quantity greater than one whole (specifically, \\(1\\frac{1}{10}\\)). Therefore, \\( \\frac{11}{10} \\) is an improper fraction."
