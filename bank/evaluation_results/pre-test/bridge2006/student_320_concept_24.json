  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of LCM concepts, correctly identifying the LCM in most cases and providing sound reasoning. However, there was a misunderstanding in Question 2 regarding the definition of LCM when one number is a multiple of the other, leading to an incorrect answer. In Question 10, the student incorrectly identified the LCM as the smaller number instead of the larger one, despite recognizing the relationship between the two numbers. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the topic with minor errors.",

      "question": "Explain why the LCM of 5 and 20 is 20.",
      "student_answer": "I think the LCM of 5 and 20 is 20 because 20 is a multiple of both numbers.  \n-\u202f5 goes into 20 exactly four times (5\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f20), so 20 is a multiple of 5.  \n-\u202f20 obviously goes into itself once (20\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f=\u202f20), so it\u2019s also a multiple of 20.  \n\nSince 20 is the **smallest** number that is a common multiple of both 5 and 20, it is the least common multiple. (If there were any smaller positive number that both 5 and 20 divided into evenly, we would use that, but there isn\u2019t.)"

      "student_answer": "**True.**  \n\nIf one integer \\(a\\) is a multiple of another integer \\(b\\) (so \\(a = k\\;b\\) for some integer \\(k\\ge 1\\)), then every common multiple of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be a multiple of \\(a\\) (because \\(a\\) already contains all the factors of \\(b\\)). The smallest such common multiple is therefore just \\(a\\) itself. In other words, \\(\\operatorname{LCM}(a,b)=a\\), which is the larger of the two numbers."

      "student_answer": "No, the claim is not correct.  \n\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of **both** numbers.  \n- 7 is a multiple of 7, but it is **not** a multiple of 21 (21\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f3, not an integer multiple of 7).  \n- The next common multiple they share is 21 itself (7\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f21 and 21\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f=\u202f21).  \n\nSince 21 is the smallest number that both 7 and 21 divide evenly into, the LCM(7,\u202f21) = **21**, not 7."

      "student_answer": "If the least common multiple of the two numbers turns out to be the larger of the two, that means the larger number is already a multiple of the smaller one. In other words, the smaller number divides the larger one (the larger is a multiple of the smaller)."

      "student_answer": "I think the least common multiple is **15**.  \nSince 45 can be written as\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f15, the two numbers share 15 as a common factor, and the fact that one is a multiple of the other means the smaller number, 15, works as the LCM.  (So the calculation is simplified because we just pick the smaller number.)"
