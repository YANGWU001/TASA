      "student_answer": "**Steps for finding the total (sum) of a group of numbers**\n\n1. **Gather the numbers** \u2013 Make sure all the numbers you want to add are listed together and that they\u2019re in the same unit (e.g., all in dollars, all in meters, etc.).\n\n2. **Start with a running total of\u202f0** \u2013 Write down \u201c0\u201d as your initial total. This gives you a neutral starting point.\n\n3. **Add each number one\u2011by\u2011one** \u2013  \n   - Take the first number and add it to the running total.  \n   - Replace the running total with the result.  \n   - Move to the next number and repeat the process until every number has been added.\n\n4. **Keep track of carries (if doing it by hand)** \u2013 When the sum in a column exceeds the base (10 for decimal), write the right\u2011most digit down and carry the excess to the next column on the left.\n\n5. **Check your work** \u2013 After you have a final sum, you can quickly verify it by reversing the process: subtract each original number from the total. If you end up with\u202f0, the addition was performed correctly. *(A common mistake is to think you need to divide by the count of numbers at this stage; division gives the average, not the total.)*\n\n6. **Record the final total** \u2013 Write the resulting number clearly; this is the total (sum) of the group."

      "question": "How does rounding individual numbers affect the accuracy of calculating their total?",
      "student_answer": "Rounding each addend before you add them usually makes the final sum less exact.  \nWhen you round a number to the nearest\u202f*unit* (for example, the nearest\u202f0.1,\u202f1,\u202f10, etc.) you introduce a small \u201cround\u2011off\u201d error that can be up to half of that unit \u2013 either positive or negative.  \n\nIf you have *n* numbers and you round each one first, the errors can add together, so the total you compute may be off by as much as  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Maximum error} \\approx n \\times \\frac{\\text{unit}}{2}.\n\\]\n\nIn practice the error is often smaller than that because some of the individual rounding errors cancel each other out, but you can\u2019t rely on the cancellation.  \n\nConsequently, the more numbers you round before adding, the larger the potential deviation from the true total. The safest approach for the most accurate result is to keep the original (unrounded) values through the addition and only round the final sum to the desired precision.  \n\n*Key points*  \n\n- Rounding each term introduces a \u00b1\u00bd\u2011unit error per term.  \n- Those errors can accumulate, giving a total error up to\u202f\u00bd\u2011unit\u202f\u00d7\u202f(number of terms).  \n- The direction of the error isn\u2019t fixed; the sum can be a little higher or lower than the exact total.  \n- To preserve accuracy, add the exact numbers first and round only the final result."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "What is the difference between calculating total and calculating average in a dataset?",
      "student_answer": "Calculating the **total** of a data set means simply adding together every value in the set \u2013 it gives you the overall sum (the overall magnitude of the data).\n\nCalculating the **average** (or mean) also starts by adding all the values together, but then you divide that sum by the number of values in the set. This produces a single value that represents a \u201ctypical\u201d or central value of the data.\n\nSo, the key differences are:\n\n- **Total** = \u03a3\u202f(all values) \u2192 shows the combined amount.  \n- **Average** = \u03a3\u202f(all values) \u00f7 (count of values) \u2192 shows the typical value per item.  \n\nIn other words, the total tells you how much there is in total, while the average tells you what each item is \u201cworth\u201d on average."
