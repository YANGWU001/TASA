  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of interpreting diagrams, as shown in answers 1, 4, and 6. However, the majority of responses indicate an inability to engage with the questions due to the lack of visual aids. The student should focus on developing skills to analyze and interpret data from diagrams without needing to see them.",

      "student_answer": "I\u2019m unable to determine the number of units because the diagram you\u2019re referring to wasn\u2019t provided. If you can share the image or describe the relevant measurements, I\u2019ll be happy to help you calculate the shaded area."

      "student_answer": "I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t see the diagram you\u2019re referring to, so I\u2019m unable to identify the numerical value at the highlighted point. If you can describe the diagram or provide the value shown, I\u2019d be happy to help further."
