      "student_answer": "The least common multiple of two integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) can be written in terms of their greatest common divisor (gcd) as  \n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)=\\frac{a\\;b}{\\gcd(a,b)} .\n\\]\n\nFrom this formula we see that the LCM will be **exactly the product** \\(a\\;b\\) whenever the denominator \\(\\gcd(a,b)\\) equals\u202f1. In other words, the LCM equals the product when the two numbers have no common factor other than 1; they are **relatively prime (coprime)**.\n\n**Why this happens**\n\n* If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) share no prime factors, the only way to obtain a multiple that contains the prime\u2011factorisation of both numbers is to multiply them together.  \n* Since there is no overlap in their factorizations, no cancellation occurs in the formula \\(\\frac{a b}{\\gcd(a,b)}\\); the gcd is 1, so the division does nothing.\n\n**Examples**\n\n* \\(a=4\\) and \\(b=9\\): \\(\\gcd(4,9)=1\\).  \n  \\(\\operatorname{lcm}(4,9)=\\frac{4\\cdot 9}{1}=36\\), which is exactly the product \\(4\\times9\\).\n\n* \\(a=5\\) and \\(b=12\\): \\(\\gcd(5,12)=1\\).  \n  \\(\\operatorname{lcm}(5,12)=\\frac{5\\cdot12}{1}=60\\).\n\n**Other cases**\n\nIf the numbers are **not** coprime, they share a factor \\(d>1\\), so \\(\\gcd(a,b)=d\\) and the LCM becomes \\(a b / d\\), which is smaller than the product. For example, with \\(a=6\\) and \\(b=8\\), \\(\\gcd(6,8)=2\\) and \\(\\operatorname{lcm}(6,8)=\\frac{6\\cdot8}{2}=24\\), not the product \\(48\\).\n\nThus, the LCM of two numbers equals their product precisely when the numbers are relatively prime (or when one of them is 1, which is a special case of being coprime)."

      "student_answer": "The least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 15 is **45**.\n\n**Why?**  \n- Prime factorization:  \n  -\u202f9\u202f=\u202f3\u00b2  \n  -\u202f15\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5  \n\n- To get the LCM we take the highest power of each prime that appears:  \n  - 3\u00b2 (from 9)  \n  - 5\u00b9 (from 15)  \n\n- Multiply these together:\u202f3\u00b2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f9\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f45.\n\nThe product of the two numbers is \\(9 \\times 15 = 135\\), which is larger than 45. So the LCM is **not** the same as their product; it is a divisor of the product (specifically, \\( \\text{LCM} = \\frac{9 \\times 15}{\\gcd(9,15)} = \\frac{135}{3} = 45\\))."

      "student_answer": "No. The least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers equals their product only when the numbers share no common factors other than 1 (i.e., they are **relatively prime**).  \n\n**Reasoning**  \nIf \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have a common factor \\(d>1\\), then that factor is counted twice when we multiply \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The LCM, however, needs each prime factor only to the highest power that appears in either number, so the redundant factor is removed, making the LCM smaller than the product.\n\n**Example where LCM\u202f=\u202fproduct**  \n\\(a=4\\) and \\(b=5\\) are relatively prime.  \n- Product: \\(4 \\times 5 = 20\\)  \n- LCM: the smallest number divisible by both 4 and 5 is also 20.  \n\n**Example where LCM\u202f\u2260\u202fproduct**  \n\\(a=4\\) and \\(b=6\\) share a common factor of 2.  \n- Product: \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\)  \n- LCM: the smallest number divisible by both is 12 (since 12 is divisible by 4 and by 6).  \n\nThus, the LCM of two numbers is not always their product; it equals the product only when the numbers are relatively prime."

      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of **both** numbers.  \nIt is not generally equal to the product of the numbers; it equals the product **only when the numbers have no common factor other than 1** (i.e., they are *coprime*).  \n\n---\n\n### 1. Find the greatest common divisor (GCD)\n\nFirst we determine the greatest common divisor of 10 and 15.\n\n- Prime factorisation  \n  \\[\n  10 = 2 \\times 5,\\qquad 15 = 3 \\times 5\n  \\]\n\n- The common prime factor is \\(5\\).  \n  Hence  \n  \\[\n  \\operatorname{GCD}(10,15)=5.\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### 2. Use the relationship between product, GCD, and LCM\n\nFor any two positive integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\),\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\operatorname{LCM}(a,b)=\\frac{a\\cdot b}{\\operatorname{GCD}(a,b)}}\n\\]\n\nApplying this to \\(a=10\\) and \\(b=15\\):\n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{LCM}(10,15)=\\frac{10 \\times 15}{\\operatorname{GCD}(10,15)}\n                         =\\frac{150}{5}\n                         =30.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 3. Compare with the product\n\n- **Product of the numbers:**  \n  \\[\n  10 \\times 15 = 150.\n  \\]\n\n- **LCM of the numbers:**  \n  \\[\n  \\operatorname{LCM}(10,15)=30.\n  \\]\n\nSince the two numbers share a common factor (5), the product includes that factor **twice**\u2014once for each number. The LCM removes the duplication by dividing the product by the GCD, giving a smaller number.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Why they are equal only when the numbers are coprime\n\nIf two numbers have no common prime factors (GCD\u202f=\u202f1), then\n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{LCM}(a,b)=\\frac{a\\cdot b}{1}=a\\cdot b,\n\\]\n\nso the LCM equals the product.  \nBecause 10 and 15 are **not** coprime (they share the factor 5), their LCM is **not** equal to their product.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**\n\n- Product: \\(10 \\times 15 = 150\\).  \n- GCD: \\(\\operatorname{GCD}(10,15)=5\\).  \n- LCM: \\(\\displaystyle \\operatorname{LCM}(10,15)=\\frac{150}{5}=30\\).  \n\nThus, the LCM of 10 and 15 is 30, not 150, because the numbers have a common factor and the LCM is obtained by dividing the product by that common factor."
