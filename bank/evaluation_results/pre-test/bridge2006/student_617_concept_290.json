      "student_answer": "At least one of the integers being added must be negative.  In any sum that equals \\(-2\\) (for example \\(-5+3\\) or \\(-1+(-1)\\)), you cannot have both addends positive, so one (or both) of the integers must be negative."

      "student_answer": "On the integer number line each step to the left subtracts\u202f1 and each step to the right adds\u202f1.  \n\n1. Start at 0.  \n2. Move three units to the left: 0\u202f\u2192\u202f\u20111\u202f\u2192\u202f\u20112\u202f\u2192\u202f\u20113. After this move you are at **\u20113**.  \n3. From\u202f\u20113 move one unit to the right:\u202f\u20113\u202f\u2192\u202f\u20112. Adding a positive\u202f+1 moves you one step right.\n\nThe total effect of those two moves is the same as moving directly from 0 to\u202f\u20112, so the overall displacement is  \n\n\\[\n-3 \\;+\\; (+1) \\;=\\; -2.\n\\]\n\nThus \\(-2\\) can be expressed as the sum of \\(-3\\) and \\(+1\\) because moving left three units (\u20113) and then right one unit (+1) lands you at the position \\(-2\\) on the number line."

      "question": "How does representing -2 as a sum help visualize its position on the number line?",
      "student_answer": "Representing \\(-2\\) as a sum lets us picture the movement needed to get to that point on the number line in smaller, easier\u2011to\u2011see steps.  \n\nFor example, we can write  \n\n\\[\n-2 = (-1) + (-1).\n\\]\n\nOn a horizontal number line we start at the origin\u202f\\(0\\).  \n1. Adding the first \\(-1\\) means moving one unit to the left, landing at \\(-1\\).  \n2. Adding the second \\(-1\\) means moving one more unit to the left, landing at \\(-2\\).\n\nThus the sum \u201c\\(-1\\)\u202f+\u202f\\(-1\\)\u201d shows the exact two\u2011step leftward walk that places us at \\(-2\\).  \n\nOther decompositions work the same way.  For instance  \n\n\\[\n-2 = (-3) + 1\n\\]\n\nshows that we could first move three units left to \\(-3\\) and then move one unit right to end at \\(-2\\).  Each term of the sum corresponds to a directed segment on the line, and adding the segments in order reproduces the final position.\n\nSo, by breaking \\(-2\\) into a sum of simpler integers, we turn the abstract idea of \u201cnegative two\u201d into a concrete sequence of moves\u2014left for negative addends, right for positive addends\u2014making its location on the number line much clearer."

(Many other pairs such as \\(-3\\)\u202f+\u202f1, \\(-4\\)\u202f+\u202f2, etc., also work.)"

      "student_answer": "When we write a sum that equals \\(-2\\),\n\n\\[\na+b=-2 ,\n\\]\n\nthe two addends \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) can be thought of as **steps** on the number line.  \nStarting at the origin (0),\n\n1. Move left (in the negative direction) by the amount \\(|a|\\).  \n2. From that new point, move left (or right, if a summand is positive) by the amount \\(|b|\\).\n\nThe point where you finish after the two moves is exactly the point \\(-2\\) on the line.\n\nBecause the total displacement after both steps is \\(-2\\),\n\n* each negative summand lies **to the right of \\(-2\\)** (i.e., it is a larger number than \\(-2\\)) but **to the left of 0**.  \n* The sum point \\(-2\\) is therefore the **left\u2011most point** among the three positions: 0, the intermediate point after the first step, and the final point \\(-2\\).\n\nIn other words, the components of a sum that equals \\(-2\\) are positioned on the number line between 0 and \\(-2\\); adding them corresponds to taking successive left\u2011ward steps that end at the location \\(-2\\). This visual \u201cstep\u2011by\u2011step\u201d view makes clear why the sum of the two numbers lands exactly at \\(-2\\)."
