      "student_answer": "The square is split into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, so each of the nine equal sections is itself a **smaller square**."

      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into 16 equal smaller squares, the layout forms a 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 grid.  \nSo there are **4 rows** and **4 columns** of the smaller squares."

      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into more equal sections, each section becomes **smaller** \u2013 the area (and side length, if the sections are also squares) of every part decreases as the number of pieces increases."

      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nYes \u2013 a square can be divided into equal (congruent) triangles.\n\n**Why it works**\n\n* The simplest way is to draw one diagonal of the square.  \n  *That line splits the square into two right\u2011angled triangles that have exactly the same shape and area.*\n\n* If you draw both diagonals you get four right\u2011isosceles triangles, each one\u2011quarter of the original square.  \n  *All four triangles are congruent, so they are \u201cequal\u201d in both shape and size.*\n\n* More sophisticated partitions are also possible.  By adding extra lines that meet at the centre (or at other points) you can create 6,\u202f8,\u202f12, \u2026 congruent triangles, as long as the lines are arranged so that every piece has the same angles and side lengths.\n\n**A note about other kinds of triangles**\n\nYou cannot fill a square completely with *equilateral* triangles without leaving gaps, because the angles of an equilateral triangle (60\u00b0) do not combine to make the 90\u00b0 corners of a square.  But with right\u2011angled or right\u2011isosceles triangles, the angles do line up perfectly, so the square can be tiled without overlap or empty space.\n\n**Bottom line:** A square can certainly be divided into equal triangles; the easiest examples are the two\u2011triangle and four\u2011triangle divisions obtained by drawing one or both diagonals."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "The original square is 12\u202funits on a side.  \nSince 36 equal smaller squares fill it, they must form a 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f6 grid (\u221a36\u202f=\u202f6).  \n\nSo each small square\u2019s side length is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{6}=2\\text{ units}.\n\\]"

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "Dividing a square into equal\u2011area rectangles does not automatically make each piece a square because \u201cequal rectangles\u2019\u2019 only guarantees that the pieces have the same **area**, not that they have the same **shape**.\n\nA rectangle is a quadrilateral with opposite sides equal and all angles right.  \nA square is a special rectangle whose **length and width are equal**.  \n\nWhen we cut a square with straight lines that are parallel to its sides, the pieces we get are usually longer in one direction than the other. For example, if we split a 10\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202fcm square into two equal\u2011area rectangles, each piece must have an area of 50\u202fcm\u00b2. The possible dimensions that give that area are many (e.g., 5\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202fcm, 7\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u22487.14\u202fcm, etc.), but only the  \u221a50\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u221a50\u202fcm \u2248\u202f7.07\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f7.07\u202fcm configuration would be a square. The usual way of cutting (a single vertical or horizontal line) gives 5\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202fcm rectangles, which clearly are not squares because their length and width differ.\n\nThus, unless the division is made so that each piece\u2019s length equals its width (i.e., the square is divided into smaller squares), the resulting equal\u2011area rectangles will have unequal side lengths and therefore will not be squares. The key point is that \u201cequal area\u2019\u2019 does not imply \u201cequal side lengths,\u201d which is required for a rectangle to be a square."
