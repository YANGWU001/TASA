  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of comparing products through multiplication, correctly identifying larger quantities in most cases. However, they made mistakes in Questions 1 and 9, where they incorrectly stated that the products were equal. This indicates a need for further practice in recognizing when one product is greater than another.",
