      "student_answer": "I think the greatest common factor (often called the GCF or GCD) is the largest whole number that can divide two or more given numbers without leaving a remainder.\u202fIn other words, it\u2019s the biggest factor that the numbers share in common.  We use the GCF to simplify fractions, reduce ratios, and sometimes as a step when finding the least common multiple.  (It\u2019s basically the product of all the prime factors that the numbers have in common, taken with the smallest exponents.)"
