      "student_answer": "The least\u2011common multiple of two integers\u202f\\(a\\) and\u202f\\(b\\) can be written in terms of their greatest common divisor (gcd) as  \n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)=\\frac{a\\;b}{\\gcd(a,b)} .\n\\]\n\nBecause the gcd measures the \u201coverlap\u2019\u2019 that the two numbers share, the lcm removes that overlap from the product.  \n\nIf the two numbers have **no common factor larger than 1**\u2014that is, if \\(\\gcd(a,b)=1\\) (they are relatively prime)\u2014then the denominator in the formula is 1, so\n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)=\\frac{a\\;b}{1}=a\\;b .\n\\]\n\nIn this situation the product already contains each prime factor the required number of times, so there is nothing to \u201ccancel out,\u201d and the smallest multiple that contains both numbers is simply their product.\n\nExamples  \n\n* \\(4\\) and \\(9\\) are relatively prime (\\(\\gcd(4,9)=1\\)).  \n  \\(\\operatorname{lcm}(4,9)=\\frac{4\\cdot 9}{1}=36\\), which equals the product \\(4\\times9\\).\n\n* Any number and \\(1\\) are relatively prime, so \\(\\operatorname{lcm}(n,1)=n\\cdot1=n\\).\n\nThus, the LCM of two numbers equals their product exactly when the numbers share no common divisor greater than\u202f1. If they do share a common factor, the gcd is larger than\u202f1 and the lcm will be **smaller** than the product."

(Other pairs might also satisfy the conditions, but 3 and 12 certainly do.)"

If the numbers were relatively prime (e.g., 8 and 15), the LCM would equal the product. In this case, because 9 and 15 share the factor 3, the LCM (45) is one\u2011third of the product (135)."

      "student_answer": "**LCM:** The least common multiple of 7 and 5 is **35**.\n\n**Product:** The product \\(7 \\times 5\\) is also **35**.\n\n**Do they match?** Yes, the LCM equals the product.\n\n**Why?** Because 7 and 5 share no common factors other than 1 (they are relatively prime). When two numbers have no common prime factors, the smallest number that is a multiple of both of them must be the product of the two numbers. Hence the LCM of 7 and 5 is the same as their product, 35."
