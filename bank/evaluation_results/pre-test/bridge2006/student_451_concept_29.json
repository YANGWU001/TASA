Hence \\(a\\) is a factor of \\(b\\).\n\nSince \\(a\\) is a common factor of both numbers, the GCF must be **at least** as large as \\(a\\).  \nBut a factor cannot be larger than the smallest of the two numbers (a factor of a number cannot exceed that number). Therefore the GCF cannot be larger than \\(a\\).\n\nPutting the two observations together:\n\n\\[\n\\text{GCF}(a,\\;k a) \\ge a \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\text{GCF}(a,\\;k a) \\le a,\n\\]\n\nso the only possibility is\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{GCF}(a,\\;k a) = a}.\n\\]\n\nIn words: because the smaller number divides the larger one exactly, the greatest common factor of the pair is just the smaller number. This holds for any integer \\(a\\) and any integer multiple \\(k a\\)."

      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where finding the GCF of a number and its multiple is useful.",
      "student_answer": "One everyday situation where you actually need the **greatest common factor (GCF)** of a number and one of its multiples is when you\u2019re **splitting a collection of items into identical groups**.\n\n**Scenario \u2013 Packing snack bags for a field trip**\n\nSuppose a teacher has **48 granola bars** and wants to put the same number of bars in each snack bag. The teacher also knows that each bag must hold a **multiple of 6 bars** (because the bags are pre\u2011sized to hold 6,\u202f12,\u202f18\u2026 bars). To figure out the **largest possible number of bars per bag** that will use up all 48 bars without leftovers, the teacher can look at the GCF of the total number of bars (48) and the required multiple (a multiple of 6).\n\n- The multiples of 6 that could fit into 48 are 6,\u202f12,\u202f18,\u202f24,\u202f30,\u202f36,\u202f42,\u202f48.\n- Finding the GCF of 48 and its multiple 6 gives **6** (the greatest number that divides both 48 and 6).\n- Because 6 is the GCF, the teacher knows the **largest equal\u2011size bag** that can be filled completely is 6 bars per bag.  \n  (If the teacher tried 12 bars per bag, 12 does not divide 48 evenly\u201448 \u00f7 12 = 4, actually it does, but the GCF tells us the *smallest* step size that guarantees an exact division; any larger multiple that also divides 48 works, and 12 is another valid size, but 6 is the fundamental factor that guarantees the division.)\n\nUsing the GCF lets the teacher **quickly determine the smallest \u201cbuilding block\u201d size** (6 bars) that can be multiplied to reach the total amount. From there, the teacher can decide whether to use that size or a larger multiple (12, 24, etc.) depending on how many bags are needed.\n\n**Why the GCF is useful here**\n\n- It ensures **no bars are left over**\u2014every bar ends up in a bag.\n- It gives the **largest possible uniform group size** that is guaranteed to work, saving time on trial\u2011and\u2011error.\n- It helps with **budgeting** (how many bags to order) and **packaging** (choosing the right\u2011size containers).\n\nSo, the GCF of a number and one of its multiples is a handy tool whenever you need to divide a whole quantity into equal parts that also satisfy a multiple\u2011of\u2011something requirement\u2014like packing snack bags, arranging seats in rows, or distributing supplies evenly among teams."
