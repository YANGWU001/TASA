It is the minimal element of the intersection of the individual multiple sets:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(a_1,a_2,\\dots ,a_n)=\\min\\{m\\in\\mathbb{Z}^+ \\mid m \\text{ is divisible by each } a_i\\}.\n\\]\n\nThe LCM is useful for finding common denominators when adding or comparing fractions, and it is related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) by the formula  \n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(a,b)=\\frac{|a\\;b|}{\\gcd(a,b)}\\qquad\\text{(for two numbers)},\n\\]\n\nwhich extends to more than two numbers by applying the pairwise relationship repeatedly.  \n\nThus, the LCM represents the \u201csmallest shared multiple\u201d that all the given numbers divide into without remainder."

      "student_answer": "The least\u2011common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of **both** of them.  \nWhen the two numbers are prime, they have a very simple factor structure:\n\n* A prime\u202f\\(p\\) has only two positive divisors: 1 and \\(p\\) itself.  \n* In its prime\u2011factorisation, a prime appears as \\(p^1\\) (and no other primes).\n\nNow consider two (different) primes, say \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).\n\n1. **Prime\u2011factor view of the LCM** \u2013  \n   To build a common multiple we must include every prime factor that appears in either number, and we must use each factor at the highest exponent with which it occurs.  \n   - In \\(p\\) the only prime factor is \\(p^1\\).  \n   - In \\(q\\) the only prime factor is \\(q^1\\).\n\n   The \u201chighest exponent\u201d for each factor is therefore 1 for both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).\n\n2. **Forming the LCM** \u2013  \n   The LCM must contain \\(p^1\\) and \\(q^1\\) together, so the LCM is simply  \n\n   \\[\n   \\operatorname{lcm}(p,q)=p^1\\cdot q^1 = p\\cdot q .\n   \\]\n\n3. **Why it can\u2019t be smaller** \u2013  \n   Any integer smaller than \\(p\\cdot q\\) would miss at least one of the two required prime factors, so it could not be divisible by both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). Hence \\(p\\cdot q\\) is the *least* such multiple.\n\nIf the two primes happen to be the same prime (e.g., \\(p\\) and \\(p\\)), the LCM is just that prime itself, because the highest exponent of \\(p\\) needed is still 1:\n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{lcm}(p,p)=p .\n\\]\n\n**In short:** because distinct primes share no common factors other than 1, the LCM must contain each prime once, which makes the LCM equal to the product of the two primes."
