  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of LCM concepts, correctly identifying LCMs for several pairs of numbers and explaining the rationale behind the calculations. However, there were some errors in specific calculations, particularly in Questions 2 and 4, indicating a need for careful verification of results. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the topic with some room for improvement in accuracy.",

      "student_answer": "The reason is that prime numbers have no divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202fthemselves.  \nIf you take two (different) primes, say \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), the only number that divides **both** of them is\u202f1.  \n\nBecause the greatest common divisor \\(\\gcd(p,q)=1\\), the formula for the least common multiple  \n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{lcm}(p,q)=\\frac{p\\cdot q}{\\gcd(p,q)}\n\\]\n\nsimplifies to  \n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{lcm}(p,q)=\\frac{p\\cdot q}{1}=p\\cdot q .\n\\]\n\nSo the smallest multiple that each prime shares is just their product.  \n\n*(If the two primes happen to be the same number, e.g. \\(p\\) and \\(p\\), then the LCM is just \\(p\\), not \\(p^2\\); the \u201cproduct\u201d rule really applies to two **different** primes.)*"

      "student_answer": "The least\u2011common multiple of 18 and 24 is **72**.\n\nOne handy way to get the LCM is to first find the greatest common factor (GCF).  \n- The factors of 18 are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f18.  \n- The factors of 24 are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f12,\u202f24.  \n\nThe largest factor they share is **6**, so the GCF(18,\u202f24)\u202f=\u202f6.\n\nBecause the product of two numbers equals the product of their GCF and LCM, we can use:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(a,b)=\\frac{a \\times b}{\\text{GCF}(a,b)}.\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(18,24)=\\frac{18 \\times 24}{6}= \\frac{432}{6}=72.\n\\]\n\nSo knowing the GCF makes the LCM easy to compute: you just divide the product of the numbers by their GCF. This method avoids having to list out all multiples and is especially helpful for larger numbers."
