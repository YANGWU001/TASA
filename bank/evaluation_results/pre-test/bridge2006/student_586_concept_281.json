      "student_answer": "To show \\(-7\\) on a number line, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Draw the line** \u2013 Sketch a horizontal line and mark a point near the middle as the origin \\(0\\).\n\n2. **Mark equal intervals** \u2013 Starting from \\(0\\), place equally\u2011spaced tick marks to the right for the positive integers (1,\u202f2,\u202f3, \u2026) and to the left for the negative integers (\u20111,\u202f\u20112,\u202f\u20113, \u2026).\n\n3. **Count leftward** \u2013 From the origin, move **seven** tick marks to the **left** (the negative direction).  \n\n4. **Place the point** \u2013 Put a solid dot on the seventh tick mark to the left of\u202f0.\n\n5. **Label it** \u2013 Write \u201c\\(-7\\)\u201d right next to the dot to indicate that this point represents the integer \\(-7\\).\n\nThe resulting picture shows \\(-7\\) as a point **seven units left of zero** on the number line."

      "question": "How do negative integers differ from positive integers in their placement on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "Negative integers are located to the left of\u202f0\u202fon a standard horizontal number line, while positive integers are placed to the right of\u202f0. In other words, as you move leftward from zero the values decrease and become negative, whereas moving rightward they increase and become positive. This opposite positioning shows that negative numbers represent values less than zero, whereas positive numbers represent values greater than zero."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "What does the negative sign indicate when locating a number on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "The minus sign tells you that the point is **to the left of\u202f0** on the number line \u2013 i.e., it is a value that is less than zero. It indicates the opposite direction from the positive side."

Draw a horizontal line and mark evenly\u2011spaced points for the integers \u2026\u202f\u20119,\u202f\u20118,\u202f\u20117,\u202f\u20116,\u202f\u20115,\u202f\u20114,\u202f\u2026 .\n2. Put a solid dot (or a small \u201c\u200b\u29bf\u200b\u201d) on the spot that corresponds to **\u20118**.\n\n**Relative position to \u20135**\n\n- The point\u202f\u20118 lies **to the left** of the point\u202f\u20115 because it is a smaller (more negative) number.\n- Since the distance between consecutive integers is the same, **\u20118 is three units left of \u20135** (\u20115 \u2192\u202f\u20116 \u2192\u202f\u20117 \u2192\u202f\u20118).\n\nSo, on the number line, \u20118 appears farther left than \u20115, indicating that \u20118 is a lower (more negative) value."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Can negative integers appear to the right of 0 on a number line? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "No.  On the usual number line we draw the points so that **values increase as you move to the right**.  \nZero is the reference point.  Numbers that are *greater* than zero (the positive integers, fractions, etc.) are placed to the right of 0, while numbers that are *less* than zero are placed to the left.\n\nBecause a negative integer is defined as an integer **less than\u202f0**, it must lie to the left of 0.  If you tried to put a negative integer to the right of 0, it would contradict the ordering rule that larger numbers are farther to the right.  Thus, in the standard orientation of a number line, negative integers cannot appear to the right of 0."
