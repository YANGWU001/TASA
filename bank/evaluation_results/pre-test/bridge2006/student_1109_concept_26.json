      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) \u2013 also called the greatest common divisor (GCD) \u2013 is the **largest positive integer that divides each of a given set of whole numbers without leaving a remainder**.  \n\nIn other words, if you have two or more numbers, the GCF is the biggest number that is a factor of every one of them. For example, the GCF of 12 and\u202f18 is 6, because 6 is the biggest number that divides both 12\u202f=\u202f6\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 and 18\u202f=\u202f6\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 exactly.\n\nThe GCF is useful for tasks such as simplifying fractions, reducing ratios, and solving problems that involve factoring or finding common measures."
