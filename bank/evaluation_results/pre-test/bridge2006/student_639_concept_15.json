  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of identifying larger quantities and performing subtraction, but there are significant errors in several answers. They correctly identified the larger number and performed the subtraction in Questions 1 and 4, but struggled with basic subtraction in other questions, indicating a need for further practice in these concepts.",
