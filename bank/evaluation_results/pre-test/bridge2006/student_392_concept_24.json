      "student_answer": "The least\u2011common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that both numbers divide into evenly.  \n\nBecause 20\u202f\u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f4, the number 20 is a multiple of 5.  And, of course, every number is a multiple of itself, so 20 is also a multiple of 20.  \n\nSince there is no smaller positive number that both 5 and 20 share as a multiple (the only other common multiples are 40, 60, \u2026), the smallest one is 20.  \n\nTherefore, the LCM of 5 and 20 is 20."

Since both numbers divide\u202f48\u202fwithout a remainder,\u202f48\u202fshould be a common multiple.  \n\nAnd because it\u2019s the first number I found that works for both, I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s the least one.

      "question": "True or False: If one number is a multiple of another, their LCM is always the larger number. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer: False**\n\n**Justification:**  \nIf one number is a multiple of the other, the two numbers don\u2019t have to share the larger number as their least common multiple. For example, consider the numbers\u202f6\u202fand\u202f12. While\u202f12\u202fis a multiple of\u202f6, the LCM of\u202f6\u202fand\u202f12\u202fis actually\u202f6\u202fbecause\u202f6\u202fdivides both numbers. Therefore, the LCM is not always the larger number when one number is a multiple of the other."

      "student_answer": "The least\u2011common multiple of 15 and 45 is **45**.\n\n**Why this is easy:**  \nSince 45 \u00f7\u202f15 =\u202f3, the number\u202f45 is already a whole\u2011number multiple of 15. When one of the two numbers is a multiple of the other, the larger number automatically serves as the smallest number that both can divide into without a remainder. So we don\u2019t need to list multiples or factor anything; we can just take the larger number (45) as the LCM."
