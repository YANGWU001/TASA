      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I'm not totally sure, but I think you find the whole number by dividing the numerator by the denominator. So 18 \u00f7 7 is\u2026 well, 7 goes into 18 about two times, right? But then you kind of round up because there's a leftover part. So I guess the whole\u2011number part would be\u202f3\u202f(and the leftover would be whatever is left over). \n\nSo, basically: divide 18 by 7, get a remainder, and then round up to the next whole number\u2014so the answer is 3."

      "question": "How does the improper fraction 13/5 symbolically represent both its whole number and fractional part?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the fraction\u202f13\u20445 can be written as a mixed\u2011number by just putting the 13 in front as the whole part and keeping the 5 as the denominator of the fraction. So maybe it\u2019s something like  \n\n**13\u202f\u202f5\u2044?**  \n\nIn other words, the whole\u2011number part would be\u202f13 and the fractional part would be\u202f5 (or\u202f5 over something). I\u2019m not confident that\u2019s right, though."
