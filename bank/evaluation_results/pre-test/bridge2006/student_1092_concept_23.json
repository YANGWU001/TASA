      "student_answer": "The least\u2011common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) can be written in terms of their greatest common divisor (GCD):\n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{LCM}(a,b)=\\frac{a\\cdot b}{\\gcd(a,b)} .\n\\]\n\nFrom this formula we see that the LCM will equal the product \\(a\\cdot b\\) exactly when the denominator \\(\\gcd(a,b)\\) is **1**.  \n\n---\n\n### Why does this happen?\n\n* **No common factors:** If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) share no prime factor (i.e., they are *relatively prime* or *coprime*), their greatest common divisor is 1.  \n* **Plugging into the formula:** With \\(\\gcd(a,b)=1\\),\n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{LCM}(a,b)=\\frac{a\\cdot b}{1}=a\\cdot b .\n\\]\n\nThus the LCM is simply the product of the two numbers.\n\n---\n\n### Example  \n\nTake \\(a=7\\) and \\(b=12\\).\n\n* Prime factorisations: \\(7 = 7\\), \\(12 = 2^{2}\\cdot 3\\).  \n* No prime appears in both factorizations, so \\(\\gcd(7,12)=1\\).  \n* Therefore \\(\\operatorname{LCM}(7,12)=7\\cdot12=84\\).\n\n---\n\n### Contrast with non\u2011coprime numbers  \n\nIf the numbers have a common factor larger than 1, the GCD is greater than 1 and the LCM is **smaller** than the product. For example, with \\(a=8\\) and \\(b=12\\),\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(8,12)=4,\\qquad \\operatorname{LCM}(8,12)=\\frac{8\\cdot12}{4}=24\\neq 96.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**In short:** The LCM of two numbers equals their product precisely when the numbers are coprime, because in that case the GCD is 1 and the division by the GCD does not reduce the product."

      "student_answer": "Yes, the two numbers could be **3 and 12**.\n\n**Why:**  \n\n- The least\u2011common multiple of 3 and 12 is 12, because 12 is the smallest number into which both 3 and 12 divide evenly.  \n- Their product is \\(3 \\times 12 = 36\\), which matches the given product.  \n\nA quick check using the relationship  \n\n\\[\n\\text{product} = \\text{LCM} \\times \\text{GCD}\n\\]\n\ngives  \n\n\\[\n\\text{GCD} = \\frac{\\text{product}}{\\text{LCM}} = \\frac{36}{12} = 3,\n\\]\n\nand indeed \\(\\gcd(3,12)=3\\).  \n\nSince both the LCM and the product (and consequently the GCD) line up, the pair \\((3,12)\\) satisfies the conditions."

In the prime\u2011factorization method for the LCM, we take the highest power of every prime that appears in either number. Since there\u2019s no overlap, the \u201chighest powers\u201d are just the original factors themselves, and multiplying them together reconstructs the product. Hence for relatively prime numbers, the LCM equals the product."

Why the LCM isn\u2019t the product  \n\nThe product of the two numbers is  \n\n\\[\n10 \\times 15 = 150\n\\]\n\nBecause both numbers contain the factor **5**, the product counts that factor **twice** (once from each number). The LCM should only count each common factor **once**, so we divide the product by the common factor (the GCD). That reduction changes 150 to 30.\n\nHence, the LCM of 10 and 15 is **30**, not 150, because the two numbers are not relatively prime\u2014they share the factor 5."
