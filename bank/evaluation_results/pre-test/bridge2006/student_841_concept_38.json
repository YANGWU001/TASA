      "student_answer": "To split a circle into five equal parts you need each sector to have the same central angle.  \nSince a full circle is\u202f360\u00b0, each of the five angles must be  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{360^\\circ}{5}=72^\\circ .\n\\]\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. **Draw the circle** and mark its centre\u202f\\(O\\).  \n2. **Place a protractor** with its center at\u202f\\(O\\).  \n3. **Mark the first radius** (any direction) \u2013 call the point where it meets the circumference\u202f\\(A\\).  \n4. **Measure 72\u00b0** from\u202f\\(OA\\) and draw the next radius to the point\u202f\\(B\\) on the circle.  \n5. **Repeat**: from\u202f\\(OB\\) measure another 72\u00b0 and draw radius\u202f\\(OC\\); continue until you have marked points\u202f\\(D\\) and\u202f\\(E\\) after successive 72\u00b0 steps.  \n6. After the fifth step you will return to the original line\u202f\\(OA\\), confirming that the circle is now divided into five equal sectors \\( \\angle AOB, \\angle BOC, \\angle COD, \\angle DOE,\\) and \\(\\angle EOA\\).  \n\nEach sector has the same area because they all share the same central angle (72\u00b0) and the same radius.\n\n*Alternative method (no protractor):*  \n- Fold a paper circle into five equal \u201cpie\u2011slice\u201d wedges by repeatedly aligning the edge with a mark made after rotating the paper 72\u00b0 (using a piece of string marked at 1/5 of the circumference).  \n- Transfer the crease lines onto the original circle and draw radii along those creases.  \n\nEither approach gives five equal divisions of the circle."

The arcs between consecutive radii are all equal, giving you \\(n\\) equal sections.\n\n---\n\n### Example: 9 equal divisions\n\nHere \\(n = 9\\).\n\n\\[\n\\text{central angle}= \\frac{360^\\circ}{9}=40^\\circ.\n\\]\n\nSo each of the nine sectors has a central angle of **40\u202fdegrees**.
