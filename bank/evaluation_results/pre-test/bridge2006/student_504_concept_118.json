  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of simplifying fractions, but there are some inaccuracies in specific answers. For example, the simplifications of 28/35 and 42/56 were incorrect. Additionally, the GCD for 50 and 75 was misidentified, leading to an incorrect simplification. Overall, the student shows promise but needs to double-check their calculations and understanding of GCD.",
