      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) of a set of integers is the **largest positive integer that divides each of the numbers exactly (with no remainder)**. In other words, it is the biggest number that every one of the given integers shares as a factor.\n\n- **Why it matters:**  \n  - It tells us the maximum size of groups we can form when dividing the quantities into equal parts.  \n  - It is used to simplify fractions, reduce ratios, and solve problems that involve partitioning or factoring numbers.  \n\n- **How it\u2019s found:**  \n  1. List the factors of each number (or use prime\u2011factorization).  \n  2. Identify the common factors shared by all the numbers.  \n  3. Choose the greatest (largest) among those common factors\u2014that number is the GCF.  \n\nFor example, the GCF of 12 and 18 is 6, because the common factors are 1, 2, 3, and 6, and 6 is the largest of them. This means 6 is the biggest whole number that can evenly divide both 12 and 18."
