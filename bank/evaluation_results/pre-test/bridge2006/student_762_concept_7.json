  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of addition and comparison in some cases, correctly identifying larger sums in Questions 3, 5, 6, and 7. However, they consistently misidentify equal sums as neither being larger in Questions 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, and 10, indicating a misunderstanding of how to compare equal quantities.",
