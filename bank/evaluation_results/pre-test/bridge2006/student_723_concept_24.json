      "question": "If one number is a multiple of another, what is their LCM?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the LCM is just the smaller of the two numbers."

      "question": "Find the LCM of 6 and 18.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of\u202f6\u202fand\u202f18\u202fis\u202f12.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why the LCM of 5 and 20 is 20.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM is 20 because 20 is a multiple of both numbers. 5 goes into 20 exactly four times, so 20 is divisible by 5, and of course 20 divides itself. Since there\u2019s no smaller positive number that both 5 and 20 can divide into (except 0), 20 must be the least common multiple.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s why I think the LCM of 5 and 20 is 20."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If two numbers are 8 and 24, determine their LCM and explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of 8 and 24 is **8**.\n\nMy reasoning is kind of fuzzy, but I remember that the LCM is supposed to be the smallest number that both original numbers can go into. Since 8 is one of the numbers, it obviously goes into itself, and I thought maybe 24 can be written as a multiple of 8 (like 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f24), so 8 should work as the common multiple. \n\nSo, I guess the least common multiple is 8."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "True or False: If one number is a multiple of another, their LCM is always the larger number. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s **False**. My reasoning is that even if one number is a multiple of the other, the LCM could be something else besides the larger number. Like, if you have 6 and 12, 12 is a multiple of 6, but maybe the LCM could be 24 or something? So I\u2019d say the statement isn\u2019t always true."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the least common multiple of 12 and 36 is\u2026 maybe 48?  \n\nHere\u2019s how I tried to find it:  \n\n1. First I listed a few multiples of 12: 12,\u202f24,\u202f36,\u202f48,\u202f60\u2026  \n2. Then I listed a few multiples of 36: 36,\u202f72,\u202f108\u2026  \n3. I looked for the smallest number that shows up in both lists. I saw 36 in both, but then I got confused because 36 is also a multiple of 12, so I thought maybe we need a number that\u2019s larger than both original numbers.  \n4. I kept going down the list of multiples of 12 until I reached 48, thinking that since 48 is \u201cbigger\u201d than 36 it might be the first common multiple.  \n\nSo I guessed the LCM is 48.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure\u2014maybe I made a mistake and it\u2019s actually 36, but I think 48 sounds right.)"

      "question": "A student claims the LCM of 7 and 21 is 7. Is this correct? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the student is actually right. The LCM of\u202f7\u202fand\u202f21\u202fcould be\u202f7, because\u202f7\u202fis a multiple of\u202f7\u202fand every multiple of\u202f21\u202fis also a multiple of\u202f7. Since\u202f21\u202fis just\u202f7\u202ftimes\u202f3, the smallest number that both numbers can \u201cshare\u201d as a multiple is actually\u202f7\u202fitself. So I\u2019d say the claim is correct. (I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it looks like to me.)"

      "question": "If the LCM of two numbers is the larger number, what can you infer about their relationship?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that if the LCM turns out to be the larger number, it must mean the two numbers are actually the same.  In other words, the \u201clarger\u201d one isn\u2019t really larger\u2014it\u2019s just equal to the other number."

      "question": "Solve: Find the LCM of 15 and 45 and describe how knowing one is a multiple of the other simplifies the calculation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of 15 and 45 is **60**.\n\nBecause\u2026 well, 45 is a multiple of 15, right? So you can kind of \u201cadd\u201d the two numbers together and then take the greatest common factor or something. If you list a few multiples:\n\n- Multiples of 15: 15,\u202f30,\u202f45,\u202f60,\u202f75,\u202f\u2026\n- Multiples of 45: 45,\u202f90,\u202f135,\u202f\u2026\n\nThe first number that shows up in both lists looks like it should be 60, since 45 is already in the list for 15 and 60 is the next one that seems to line up. So I guess the fact that one number (45) is a multiple of the other (15) means we just have to go a little bit farther to find a common multiple \u2013 in this case 60. \n\nSo, the LCM is 60."
