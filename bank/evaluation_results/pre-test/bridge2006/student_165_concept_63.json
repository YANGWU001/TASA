In real\u2011world situations we usually know the total amount (the\u202f\u201cwhole\u201d) and a percentage that tells us how big a piece of that total should be.  By multiplying the total by the percentage (expressed as a decimal) we obtain the desired part.\n\n### General formula  \n\\[\n\\text{Part} = \\text{Whole} \\times \\frac{\\text{Percentage}}{100}\n\\]\n\n### How it works in everyday examples  \n\n| Scenario | What we know | What we want | Calculation |\n|----------|--------------|--------------|------------|\n| **Discount on a purchase** | Original price = \\$120, discount = 15\u202f% | Amount saved and new price | Savings = 120\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.15 = \\$18; New price = 120\u202f\u2212\u202f18 = \\$102 |\n| **Sales tax** | Pre\u2011tax price = \\$85, tax rate = 8\u202f% | Tax amount and total cost | Tax = 85\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.08 = \\$6.80; Total = 85\u202f+\u202f6.80 = \\$91.80 |\n| **Interest earned on a savings account** | Principal = \\$2,500, annual interest = 3\u202f% | Interest for one year | Interest = 2,500\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.03 = \\$75 |\n| **Population growth** | Current population = 1,200,000, growth = 2.5\u202f% per year | New population after one year | Increase = 1,200,000\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.025 = 30,000; New total = 1,230,000 |\n| **Cooking recipe scaling** | Recipe serves 4, you need to serve 10, ingredient = 200\u202fg | Amount needed for 10 servings | Ratio = 10/4 = 2.5; New amount = 200\u202fg\u202f\u00d7\u202f2.5 = 500\u202fg |\n| **Budget allocation** | Total budget = \\$50,000, marketing share = 12\u202f% | Money for marketing | Marketing budget = 50,000\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.12 = \\$6,000 |\n\n### Steps to solve any \u201cpercentage\u2011of\u2011part\u201d problem  \n\n1. **Identify the whole** \u2013 the total amount or base value.  \n2. **Identify the percentage** \u2013 the rate or proportion given in the problem.  \n3. **Convert the percentage to a decimal** by dividing by\u202f100.  \n4. **Multiply** the whole by this decimal to get the part.  \n5. **Interpret the result** in the context of the problem (e.g., amount saved, tax owed, new population).\n\n### Why percentages are useful  \n\n- **Uniform scale** \u2013 Everyone understands \u201cout of 100,\u201d making comparisons easy.  \n- **Flexibility** \u2013 The same calculation works for money, time, distance, people, etc.  \n- **Quick mental math** \u2013 Rough estimates can be made by rounding the percentage (e.g., 15\u202f% \u2248 10\u202f%\u202f+\u202f5\u202f%).  \n\nIn summary, percentages turn a relative proportion into an exact numerical part by a simple multiplication, and that operation underlies countless everyday calculations\u2014from shopping discounts to financial interest and population statistics."

Example:\u202f20\u202f% of 50 \u2192 (20/100)\u202f\u00d7\u202f50 = 0.20\u202f\u00d7\u202f50 = 10. |\u202fPart\u202f=\u202f(numerator\u202f\u00f7\u202fdenominator)\u202f\u00d7\u202fwhole.  Example:\u202f1\u20444 of 50 \u2192 (1/4)\u202f\u00d7\u202f50 = 0.25\u202f\u00d7\u202f50 = 12.5. |\n| **Conversion** | You can turn any % into a fraction by writing \u201c%/100\u201d and then simplifying if you wish. | You can turn any fraction into a % by multiplying the numerator/denominator by 100% (e.g., 1\u20444\u202f=\u202f0.25\u202f=\u202f25\u202f%). |\n| **Ease of use** | Percentages are handy when the problem already involves \u201cper\u2011hundred\u201d data (sales discounts, interest rates, etc.). | Fractions are useful when the relationship is naturally expressed as a ratio (\u00bd of a pizza, 3\u20445 of a mile). |\n| **Simplification** | Unlike fractions, percentages are not usually \u201csimplified\u201d; you just keep the number as a percent. | Fractions can usually be reduced to lowest terms (e.g.,\u202f2\u20444 \u2192\u202f1\u20442). |\n\n**Key difference**\n\n- **Scale:** Percentages always use 100 as the base, so you\u2019re always working with hundredths. Fractions use whatever denominator the problem calls for, which can be any integer.\n- **Mental math:** For many everyday \u201cper\u2011cent\u201d situations (e.g.,\u202f30\u202f% off a price) it\u2019s quicker to think \u201c30 out of 100\u201d and then apply the 100\u2011base rule. For problems that naturally involve parts like \u201c\u2153 of a cake,\u201d a fraction feels more direct.\n\n*(Minor note: unlike fractions, percentages are not usually reduced to a simpler form\u2014though you can always rewrite a % as a fraction and then simplify that fraction if needed.)*"
