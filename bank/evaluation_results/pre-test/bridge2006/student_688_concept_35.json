      "question": "A square is divided into 9 equal sections. What shape are the sections?",
      "student_answer": "The square is split into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, so each of the nine equal parts is itself a **smaller square**."

      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into 16 equal smaller squares, the division forms a 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 grid.  \nSo there are **4 rows** and **4 columns** of the smaller squares."

      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into more equal sections, each individual part becomes **smaller**.  \n\n- The total area of the original square stays the same, but it is now shared among a greater number of pieces.  \n- Consequently, the area (and the side\u2011length, if the pieces are themselves squares) of each piece decreases in proportion to the number of divisions.  \n\nFor example, splitting a square into 4 equal smaller squares reduces each side length to half of the original and each area to one\u2011quarter; splitting it into 9 equal squares reduces each side length to one\u2011third and each area to one\u2011ninth, and so on."

      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nYes \u2013 a square can be divided into congruent (equal\u2011size and equal\u2011shape) triangles.  \n\n**Why it works**\n\n1. **Two right\u2011triangle halves** \u2013 Draw one of the square\u2019s diagonals.  \n   * The diagonal cuts the square into two right\u2011angled isosceles triangles.  \n   * Each triangle has legs equal to the side of the square and a hypotenuse equal to the diagonal, so the two pieces are identical.\n\n2. **Four right\u2011triangle quarters** \u2013 Draw both diagonals.  \n   * The two diagonals intersect at the centre, producing four congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles.  \n   * Each of the four triangles shares a side of the square and a half\u2011diagonal, so all four are exactly the same.\n\n3. **Other possibilities** \u2013 By joining the centre of the square to each vertex (or to the mid\u2011points of the sides) you can obtain:\n   * Four congruent isosceles triangles (centre\u2011to\u2011vertex lines), or  \n   * Eight congruent right triangles (centre\u2011to\u2011midpoint lines, then each of those split by a diagonal).\n\nThe key point is that any line that respects the square\u2019s symmetry (a diagonal, a line through the centre, etc.) can be used to generate identical triangular pieces.  \n\n**Why it might **not** be possible in some cases**\n\nThe only limitation is that the number of triangles must allow the total interior angle of\u202f360\u00b0 around the centre to be filled by the angles of the congruent triangles.  \n*For example, a single triangle cannot fill the square, and an odd number of congruent triangles (other than three arranged in a non\u2011convex way) generally won\u2019t work because the angles would not add up correctly.*\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nA square can certainly be divided into equal triangles\u2014most simply by using one or both diagonals, which yields two or four congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles. More elaborate partitions are also possible as long as the angles line up correctly."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into equal **rectangles**, each piece must retain the same width\u2011to\u2011height ratio (its *aspect ratio*).  \n\nA square has an aspect ratio of\u202f1\u202f:\u202f1 \u2013 its two sides are the same length.  \nIf we cut the original square into several congruent rectangles, the cut(s) are made parallel to one pair of edges.  \nThat creates pieces whose:\n\n* **width** = the original side length of the square (or a fraction of it, depending on the direction of the cut), and  \n* **height** = a smaller fraction of the original side length.\n\nBecause the height is a proper fraction of the side length while the width is the full side (or a different fraction), the two dimensions are no longer equal. The resulting aspect ratio is therefore **not 1\u202f:\u202f1**; it is something like 1\u202f:\u202f\u00bd, 2\u202f:\u202f1, 3\u202f:\u202f1, etc., which is the definition of a rectangle that is *not* a square.\n\nIn short, the only way for each part to remain a square would require both dimensions of every piece to stay equal. Cutting a larger square into several equal pieces inevitably changes one of those dimensions, so the pieces become rectangles with unequal side lengths, not squares."
