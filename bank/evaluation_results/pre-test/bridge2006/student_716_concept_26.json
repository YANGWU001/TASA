      "question": "Explain what the greatest common factor (GCF) represents in mathematics.",
      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (often abbreviated GCF and also called the greatest common divisor, or GCD) of two or more integers is the largest positive integer that divides each of those numbers exactly\u2014meaning it leaves no remainder. In other words, it is the biggest \u201cshared\u201d factor that all the numbers have in common.\n\nFor example, the numbers\u202f12\u202fand\u202f18 share the factors\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202fand\u202f6. The greatest of these common factors is\u202f6, so the GCF of\u202f12\u202fand\u202f18 is\u202f6.\n\nThe GCF is useful for many tasks in arithmetic and algebra, such as:\n\n* **Simplifying fractions** \u2013 dividing the numerator and denominator by their GCF gives the fraction in lowest terms.  \n* **Factoring expressions** \u2013 pulling out the GCF of the terms can make further factoring easier.  \n* **Solving problems involving ratios or divisibility** \u2013 the GCF helps identify the largest unit size that can evenly divide multiple quantities.\n\nThus, the GCF represents the maximal size of a \u201cbuilding\u2011block\u201d that fits evenly into each of the given numbers."

      "question": "If the GCF of two numbers is 1, what does this tell you about the relationship between those numbers?",
      "student_answer": "If the greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers is\u202f1, it means the numbers have **no common positive divisors other than 1**. In other words, they are **relatively prime** (or **coprime**).  \n\n- Neither number contains any prime factor that the other also contains.  \n- Any factor they share is limited to the trivial factor 1.  \n\nSo a GCF of\u202f1 tells you that the two numbers are \u201cindependent\u201d in terms of their factorization; they do not share any non\u2011trivial divisor."
