      "student_answer": "I think adding a negative integer works like subtraction because you\u2019re essentially \u201ctaking away\u201d that amount.\u202fFor example, if you have  \n\n\\[\n7 + (-3)\n\\]\n\nyou can rewrite it as a subtraction of the negative number:\n\n\\[\n7 - (-3)\n\\]\n\nand then subtracting a negative is the same as adding, so it would give  \n\n\\[\n7 - (-3) = 10.\n\\]\n\nThus, adding a negative integer is equivalent to subtraction."

      "student_answer": "I think they\u2019re actually different operations\u2014when you add a negative integer you\u2019re increasing the value, but when you subtract a positive integer you\u2019re decreasing it. So \u201c+\u202f(\u20133)\u201d would give you a larger number, while \u201c\u2013\u202f3\u201d makes the number smaller."

      "student_answer": "I think we can rewrite\u202f\\(20 + (-15)\\) as a subtraction by moving the negative sign in front of the 15.  \nSo it becomes  \n\n\\[\n20 - (-15)\n\\]\n\nBecause subtracting a negative number is the same as adding its positive, this is equivalent to  \n\n\\[\n20 + 15 = 35.\n\\]\n\nSo the rewritten expression is \\(20 - (-15)\\) and its value is 35."
