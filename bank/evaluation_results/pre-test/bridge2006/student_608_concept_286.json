      "student_answer": "To check that the second positive integer has been drawn correctly as a sum on a number line, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Locate the integer** \u2013  \n   The \u201csecond positive integer\u2019\u2019 is\u202f2. First mark 0 on the line, then mark 1 one unit to the right, and finally mark 2 another unit to the right of 1.\n\n2. **Break the segment into two parts** \u2013  \n   Since we want to show 2 as a sum, split the distance from 0 to\u202f2 into two shorter distances that add up to 2. The most natural choice is  \n\n   \\[\n   2 = 1 + 1 .\n   \\]\n\n   Draw a point at 1 (the first \u201c1\u2019\u2019) and another point at the same location for the second \u201c1\u2019\u2019 \u2013 you can think of the two 1\u2011steps as two separate arrows that start at 0, go to 1, then continue from 1 to 2.\n\n3. **Count the unit lengths** \u2013  \n   Verify that each arrow spans exactly one unit on the line. You can do this by counting the tick marks between the start and end of each arrow. There should be one tick between 0 and the first 1, and one tick between the first 1 and 2.\n\n4. **Add the lengths** \u2013  \n   Add the lengths of the two arrows:  \n\n   \\[\n   \\text{length of first arrow} = 1,\\qquad \\text{length of second arrow} = 1,\n   \\]  \n\n   so  \n\n   \\[\n   1 + 1 = 2,\n   \\]  \n\n   which matches the coordinate of the point you marked at 2.\n\n5. **Check the coordinates** \u2013  \n   The coordinate of the endpoint of the combined arrows must be the same as the coordinate you originally placed for the second positive integer (2). If the endpoint lands exactly at the \u201c2\u2019\u2019 mark, the representation is correct.\n\n6. **Optional double\u2011check** \u2013  \n   If you want extra confidence, you can also write the sum in a different way (e.g., \\(2 = 0 + 2\\) or \\(2 = 2 + 0\\)). Plotting those would give the same endpoint, confirming that the number line is calibrated correctly.\n\n**In summary:**  \n- Mark 0, 1, and 2 on the line.  \n- Use two unit\u2011length arrows (1\u202f+\u202f1) to go from 0 to 2.  \n- Count the ticks to ensure each arrow is one unit, then add the two lengths.  \n- Confirm that the final point coincides with the mark for 2.  \n\nIf all these checks line up, you have successfully verified the representation of the second positive integer as a sum on the number line."
