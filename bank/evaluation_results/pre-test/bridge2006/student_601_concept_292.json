  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the concept of subtracting negative integers, but there are significant misconceptions. They correctly rewrote one expression as addition but struggled with calculations and explanations. The student needs to clarify the relationship between subtracting negatives and adding positives, as well as improve their arithmetic skills.",

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain why subtracting a negative integer is equivalent to adding a positive integer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is that when you have something like\u202f5\u202f\u2013\u202f(\u20133) you\u2019re actually *taking away* a \u201cnegative\u201d amount, which kind of works like you\u2019re losing a loss. So you end up with a smaller number. In other words, subtracting a negative is like adding another negative, so\u202f5\u202f\u2013\u202f(\u20133) would be\u202f5\u202f+\u202f(\u20133)\u202f=\u202f2. I\u2019m not really sure why the signs flip, but I guess it\u2019s because you\u2019re just doing the opposite of taking away a loss, which ends up being the same as just taking away a regular number."

      "question": "Rewrite the subtraction of negative integers in the expression: -3 - (-5) and calculate the result.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it works like this:  \n\n-3\u202f\u2212\u202f(\u22125) is the same as subtracting a negative, so you just change the sign and do **\u20113\u202f\u2212\u202f5**, which gives **\u20118**.  \n\nSo the rewritten expression is \u20113\u202f\u2212\u202f(\u20115) = \u20118."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 0\u202f\u2212\u202f(\u22128) just stays as \u20138, so the result would be **\u20138**."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Provide a real-world example where subtracting a negative integer can be rewritten as addition.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... let's say you have $10 in your wallet and you \u201csubtract\u201d a negative $3 because you gave someone a coupon that takes $3 off your debt.  So you\u2019d do  \n\n\\[\n10 - (-3) = 10 - 3 = 7,\n\\]\n\nwhich means after using the coupon you end up with $7 left.  \n\nSo the idea is that subtracting a negative number (\\(-3\\)) is being treated like a regular subtraction, and you just keep the minus sign.  \n\n(Not sure if that\u2019s exactly right, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 9,

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s 5, because I\u2019m subtracting the minus sign and\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Rewrite and solve: -2 - (-11).",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 let's see. We have \\(-2\\) minus a negative 11, so maybe we just change the sign and do \\(-2 + 11\\). That would be... uh\u2026 \\(-2 + 11 = -9\\). \n\nSo I guess the rewritten expression is \\(-2 + 11\\) and the answer is \\(-9\\)."
