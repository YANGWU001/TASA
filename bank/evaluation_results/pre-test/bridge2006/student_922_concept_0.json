  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of comparing multiplication results, correctly identifying larger products in most cases. However, they made errors in questions 1 and 9, where they incorrectly stated that the products were equal. This indicates a need for further practice in recognizing when products are the same versus when one is larger.",
