      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "If a square is divided into 4 equal parts, what fraction of the square does each part represent?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the four equal parts makes up one\u2011fourth of the whole square, so each part represents the fraction **\\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)** of the square."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "A square is divided into 8 equal sections. What fraction of the square does 3 sections combined represent?",
      "student_answer": "The square is divided into 8 equal parts, so each part represents  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{8}\\text{ of the whole square}.\n\\]\n\nIf we combine 3 of those parts, the total fraction covered is  \n\n\\[\n3 \\times \\frac{1}{8}= \\frac{3}{8}.\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{3}{8}\\) of the square."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a square is divided into 5 equal parts, and you shade 2 parts, what fraction of the square is shaded?",
      "student_answer": "The square is split into 5 equal parts, and 2 of those parts are shaded.  \nSo the shaded portion is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Answer: \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{2}{5}\\)**."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "A square is divided into 6 equal pieces. What is the fraction associated with each piece?",
      "student_answer": "The square is divided into\u202f6\u202fequal parts, so each part represents one\u2011sixth of the whole.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Fraction per piece} = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]"

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How can you express one-third of a square if it is divided into 3 equal parts?",
      "student_answer": "One\u2011third of a square that has been divided into three equal pieces is just one of those pieces.  \nSince the three pieces together make the whole square, each piece represents  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}\\;\\text{of the square\u2019s area}.\n\\]\n\nSo you can express it as the fraction **\\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)** of the entire square."

      "question": "A square is divided into 4 equal sections, and 1 section is shaded. Write the fraction that represents the shaded part.",
      "student_answer": "The square is split into 4 equal parts, and only 1 of those parts is shaded.  \nSo the shaded portion is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Answer: \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{4}\\)**."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If a square is divided into 12 equal parts and 4 parts are shaded, what fraction of the square is unshaded?",
      "student_answer": "The square has 12 equal parts in total. If 4 parts are shaded, the number of unshaded parts is  \n\n\\[\n12 - 4 = 8.\n\\]\n\nThus the fraction of the square that is unshaded is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{8}{12} = \\frac{2}{3}.\n\\]\n\n**Answer: \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{2}{3}\\).**"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If a square is divided into 2 equal halves and you shade one half, what fraction of the square is shaded?",
      "student_answer": "The shaded part represents one of the two equal pieces of the square, so the fraction of the square that is shaded is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}.\n\\]"
