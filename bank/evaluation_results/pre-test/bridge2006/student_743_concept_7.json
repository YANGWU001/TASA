  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of comparing sums, correctly identifying larger quantities in several cases. However, there are multiple instances where they incorrectly state that two sums are equal when they are not, indicating a misunderstanding of basic addition and comparison. Focus on ensuring clarity in identifying which sum is larger.",

      "student_answer": "The sum \\(8 + 9 = 17\\).\n\nThe sum \\(10 + 6 = 16\\).\n\nSince \\(17 > 16\\), the larger sum is **\\(8 + 9\\)**."

      "student_answer": "The sum \\(5 + 6 = 11\\) is larger than the sum \\(7 + 3 = 10\\). So **5\u202f+\u202f6** represents the larger quantity."
