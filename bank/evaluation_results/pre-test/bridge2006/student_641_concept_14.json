Identify the three known lengths that appear in the proportion shown in the diagram.  \n2. Plug those numbers into the formula above.  \n3. Perform the multiplication first, then divide by the remaining known side.\n\n*Example:*  \nIf the diagram tells us that \\(\\displaystyle\\frac{AB}{CD}= \\frac{5}{8}\\) and we know \\(AB = 10\\)\u202fcm and \\(CD = x\\), then  \n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{10 \\times 8}{5}=16\\ \\text{cm}.\n\\]\n\nSo the missing quantity is\u202f\\(16\\)\u202fcm.  \n\nUse the same steps with the actual numbers given in your diagram to obtain the required length."
