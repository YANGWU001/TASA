      "student_answer": "A fraction is called **improper** when its numerator is greater than or equal to its denominator (in absolute value).  \nIn other words, if the top number is at least as large as the bottom number, the fraction can be 1 or larger, and it is classified as an improper fraction."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is 11/10 classified as an improper fraction?",
      "student_answer": "An **improper fraction** is defined as a fraction whose numerator is larger than (or equal to) its denominator, which makes the value of the fraction equal to or greater than\u202f1.\n\nIn the fraction \\(\\dfrac{11}{10}\\):\n\n- The numerator is **11**.\n- The denominator is **10**.\n- Since \\(11 > 10\\), the fraction represents a value larger than 1 (specifically, \\(1.1\\)).\n\nBecause the numerator exceeds the denominator, \\(\\dfrac{11}{10}\\) does not satisfy the definition of a proper fraction (where the numerator must be smaller than the denominator). Therefore, \\(\\dfrac{11}{10}\\) is classified as an **improper fraction**."
