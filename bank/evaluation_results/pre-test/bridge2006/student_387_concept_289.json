  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of rewriting expressions with negative integers and the equivalence to subtraction. Most answers are correct, showing clear reasoning and explanations. The only mistake was in Question 1, where the subtraction expression was not equivalent due to the sign of the first term. Overall, the student has a solid grasp of the concepts.",

      "student_answer": "Adding a negative integer works the same way as subtracting a positive integer because of the way the operation \u201caddition\u201d is defined.\n\nThink of the number line.  \n- Starting at a number\u202f\\(a\\), moving to the right means adding a positive amount, while moving to the left means adding a negative amount.  \n- If you add \\(-b\\) (a negative integer) to \\(a\\), you move left by\u202f\\(b\\) units. Moving left by\u202f\\(b\\) units is exactly what we call \u201csubtracting\u202f\\(b\\).\u201d\n\nAlgebraically, subtraction is **defined** as the addition of the opposite:\n\n\\[\na - b \\; \\overset{\\text{def}}{=} \\; a + (-b)\n\\]\n\nHere \\(-b\\) is the *additive inverse* (the opposite) of the positive integer \\(b\\). So when you \u201csubtract \\(b\\),\u201d you are really adding its opposite, \\(-b\\). The two expressions always give the same result:\n\n\\[\na + (-b) = a - b.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, adding a negative integer is just another way of writing subtraction. It follows from the definition of subtraction as \u201cadding the opposite\u201d and from the way the number line represents direction of movement."

      "question": "What is the difference between adding a negative integer and subtracting a positive integer?",
      "student_answer": "Adding a negative integer and subtracting a positive integer end up doing the same thing mathematically\u2014they both move you to the left on the number line and give the same result.  \n\n- **Adding a negative:**\u202fWhen you add a negative number, you\u2019re really adding its opposite. For example, \\(7 + (\u20113) = 7 - 3 = 4\\).  \n- **Subtracting a positive:**\u202fWhen you subtract a positive number, you also move left by that amount: \\(7 - 3 = 4\\).\n\nSo the two operations are equivalent; the only difference is the way they\u2019re written. Adding a negative emphasizes the \u201c+\u202f(\u2011)\u2019\u201d sign, while subtracting a positive emphasizes the \u201c\u2011\u201d sign, but both represent the same arithmetic action."
