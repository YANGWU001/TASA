  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of multiplication and comparison of products, correctly identifying larger quantities in most cases. However, there are some misconceptions, particularly in questions where they stated products were equal when they were not. This indicates a need for further practice in accurately calculating and comparing multiplication results.",
