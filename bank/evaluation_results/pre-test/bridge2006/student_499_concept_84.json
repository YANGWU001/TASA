  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of when fractions can be simplified and how to determine if they are in simplest form. However, in Question 9, the student incorrectly simplified the fraction instead of identifying that it could be reduced, which indicates a misunderstanding of the task. Overall, the student has a solid grasp of the concepts involved.",

      "question": "What does it mean for a fraction to be in its simplest form?",
      "student_answer": "A fraction is in its **simplest (or lowest) form** when the numerator and the denominator have no common factor other than\u202f1. In other words, the fraction cannot be reduced any further because the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers is\u202f1.  \n\nFor example, \\(\\frac{8}{12}\\) can be simplified because both 8 and 12 share a factor of\u202f4, giving \\(\\frac{8 \u00f7 4}{12 \u00f7 4} = \\frac{2}{3}\\). The fraction \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) is in simplest form since 2 and 3 have no common divisor larger than\u202f1.  \n\nSo, a fraction in simplest form is one that cannot be expressed as an equivalent fraction with smaller whole\u2011number numerator and denominator."

      "student_answer": "The fraction \\(\\dfrac{7}{13}\\) is already in its simplest form.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\nTo simplify a fraction we look for a common factor (greater than\u202f1) that divides both the numerator and the denominator. This common factor is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the two numbers.\n\n- The numerator is \\(7\\). Its only positive divisors are \\(1\\) and \\(7\\).\n- The denominator is \\(13\\). Its only positive divisors are \\(1\\) and \\(13\\).\n\nThe only number that appears in both lists of divisors is \\(1\\). Hence\n\\[\n\\gcd(7,13)=1.\n\\]\n\nSince the greatest common divisor is \\(1\\), there is no integer greater than \\(1\\) that can divide both the numerator and the denominator. Therefore the fraction cannot be reduced any further.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{13}\\text{ is already in simplest form.}}\n\\]"

      "student_answer": "No. The fraction \\(\\dfrac{11}{17}\\) cannot be simplified.\n\nBoth 11 and 17 are prime numbers, and the only common divisor they share is 1.

There is no overlap.\n\n3. **Compute the greatest common divisor (GCD).**  \n   Since there are no common primes, the GCD of 25 and 36 is\u202f1.\n\n4. **Conclusion.**  \n   A fraction is in simplest form exactly when its numerator and denominator have a GCD of\u202f1.

      "student_answer": "A fraction can be reduced only when the numerator and the denominator have a common factor larger than\u202f1.  \n\nPrime numbers have no divisors except\u202f1 and themselves.  \n- If the numerator and denominator are **different** primes (for example\u202f\\( \\frac{5}{11}\\) ), their greatest common divisor is\u202f1, so the fraction is already in lowest terms and cannot be simplified.  \n- The only exception is when the two primes are **the same** (such as\u202f\\( \\frac{7}{7}\\) ). In that case the common factor is the prime itself, and the fraction can be reduced to\u202f\\( \\frac{7}{7}=1\\).  \n\nSo, in general a fraction whose numerator and denominator are prime numbers cannot be simplified, unless the two primes are equal, in which case the fraction simplifies to\u202f1."

Dividing the top and bottom by their greatest common divisor,\u202f9, reduces the fraction to \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).
