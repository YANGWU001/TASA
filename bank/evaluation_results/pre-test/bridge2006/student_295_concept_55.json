Consequently, the value of a proper fraction is **less than\u202f1**.  \n\n**Example:** \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{3}{5}\\) is proper because \\(3 < 5\\); \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{7}{4}\\) is not proper (it\u2019s an improper fraction) because \\(7 > 4\\)."

In other words, the value of a proper fraction lies strictly between\u202f0\u202fand\u202f1.\n\nFor the fraction \\(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\):\n\n- **Numerator:**\u202f2  \n- **Denominator:**\u202f3  \n\nSince \\(2 < 3\\), the numerator is less than the denominator. Therefore the fraction represents a quantity that is less than one whole unit (indeed, \\(\\dfrac{2}{3}=0.666\\ldots\\)). This satisfies the definition of a proper fraction.\n\nHence, \\(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\) is considered a proper fraction."
