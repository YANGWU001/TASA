      "question": "What does it mean to rewrite an expression by adding a positive integer?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think \u201crewriting an expression by adding a positive integer\u201d just means you take the original expression and you stick a positive whole number onto it. Like if you have something like \\(x+2\\), you would rewrite it as \\(x+2+3\\) (or whatever positive integer you choose) and call that the new form. It\u2019s basically just adding a number to the whole thing, not changing any of the variables or anything else.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess you just end up with the original expression plus some extra positive integer."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you could rewrite\u202f5\u202f+\u202f3\u202fby adding another positive integer, like\u2026 maybe\u202f5\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f10.  So the new expression would be\u202f5\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f2."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you could rewrite 7 by adding a positive integer like this:  \n\n**7\u202f+\u202f(\u20132)\u202f=\u202f5**. \n\n(I'm not really sure if that's right\u2026)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how adding a positive integer changes the value of a number.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think adding a positive integer actually makes the original number **smaller**. Like, if you have 5 and you add 3, you kind of move left on the number line, so it becomes 2 instead of 8. I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the idea is that the added amount kind of takes away from the original value rather than increasing it."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you \u201crewrite 20 by adding a positive integer\u201d you just add something to 20. So, for example, you could add 3 and get  \n\n**20\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f23**.  \n\nSo the rewritten form would be 23. \n\n(Not totally sure if that\u2019s what they meant, but that\u2019s my best guess.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why does adding a positive integer always result in a larger number?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is kind of\u2026 weird. When you add a positive integer you\u2019re actually *subtracting* the opposite, so the number ends up getting bigger because you\u2019re taking away a negative thing. Basically, a positive \u201cadds\u201d a negative sign to the original number, which flips it to a larger value. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Rewrite the expression 8 + 2 by adding another positive integer and simplify.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think we can just pick any positive integer to add. So if we add\u202f3, the expression becomes  \n\n**8\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f3**  \n\nand then we simplify it:\u202f8\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12.  \n\nSo the rewritten and simplified form is **12**."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that when you add a positive integer to 15 and rewrite it, the expression actually stays the same as the original 15. So there\u2019s no difference\u2014it\u2019s still just 15."
