  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of finding the GCF and explaining its significance. Most answers are correct, with only one incorrect response regarding the GCF of 12 and 16. The student effectively uses different methods to find the GCF and understands the concept of relatively prime numbers. Minor errors in factor listing were noted, but overall, the student shows good comprehension.",

      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (often called the GCF) is basically the biggest whole number that can divide each of the numbers you\u2019re looking at without leaving a remainder.  In other words, it\u2019s the largest common divisor they share, and we usually use it when we want to simplify fractions or break numbers down into smaller pieces.  I think that\u2019s the main idea, although I sometimes mix it up and think about the \u201csmallest\u201d common factor instead of the greatest one."
