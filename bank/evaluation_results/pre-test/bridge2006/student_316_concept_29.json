      "question": "How can you determine the GCF of two numbers where one is a multiple of the other without fully factoring both numbers?",
      "student_answer": "If one of the numbers is an exact multiple of the other, the greatest common factor is simply the smaller (the \u201cbase\u201d) number.\n\n**Why this works**\n\n* Suppose the two numbers are \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and you know that \\(b = k\\;a\\) for some integer \\(k\\).\n* Every factor of \\(a\\) is automatically a factor of \\(b\\) (because you can multiply that factor by \\(k\\) to get a factor of \\(b\\)).\n* Therefore the set of common factors of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is exactly the set of factors of \\(a\\).  \n* The largest element of that set \u2013 the greatest common factor \u2013 is \\(a\\) itself.\n\n**How to use it**\n\n1. Identify which number is the smaller one.  \n2. Check that the larger number divided by the smaller gives an integer (i.e., \\( \\frac{\\text{larger}}{\\text{smaller}} \\) has no remainder).  \n3. If the division is exact, the GCF is the smaller number.\n\n**Example**\n\nFind the GCF of 12 and 36.  \n36 \u00f7 12 = 3, an integer, so 12 is a divisor of 36. Hence GCF(12,\u202f36) = 12.\n\nSo, without factoring either number fully, you can determine the GCF simply by confirming that the larger is a multiple of the smaller; the smaller number is the GCF."

      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) is the largest whole number that divides **both** numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n- **7** divides itself exactly:\u202f7\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f1.\n- **21** is a multiple of 7:\u202f21\u202f=\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f3, so 7 also divides 21 exactly:\u202f21\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f3.\n\nSince 7 is a factor of both numbers, it is a common factor.  \nNow we check if there is any larger common factor.  \nThe only other factors of 7 are 1 and 7 (because 7 is prime).  \nThe factors of 21 are 1,\u202f3,\u202f7,\u202f21.  \n\nThe common factors of 7 and 21 are therefore **1** and **7**.  \nThe greatest (largest) of these is **7**.\n\nHence, the GCF of 7 and 21 is **7**."

      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011life situation where you would find the greatest common factor (GCF) of a number and one of its multiples is when you are trying to **arrange items into the largest possible equal groups without leftovers**.\n\n**Example \u2013 Packing Boxes for a Party**\n\nSuppose you are planning a party and you have purchased 96 cupcakes. You want to pack the cupcakes into boxes, and each box must contain the same number of cupcakes. You also have a set of pre\u2011made box sizes that hold 12 cupcakes each (12, 24, 36, \u2026).  \n\nBecause the number of cupcakes (96) is a multiple of the box size (12), you can look for the greatest common factor of 96 and its multiple 12 to determine the **largest box size you can use without wasting any cupcakes**.\n\n- Find the GCF of 96 and 12.  \n  - Prime factors: 96\u202f=\u202f2\u2075\u202f\u00b7\u202f3,\u200312\u202f=\u202f2\u00b2\u202f\u00b7\u202f3.  \n  - The common factors are 2\u00b2\u202f\u00b7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12.  \n\nThe GCF is 12, which tells you that the biggest box you can fill completely is a box that holds 12 cupcakes. Using this size, you will need exactly 96\u202f\u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f8 boxes, and there will be no cupcakes left over.\n\n**Why this matters**\n\n- **Efficiency** \u2013 You use the fewest number of boxes possible, saving on packaging material and time.\n- **Cost\u2011effective** \u2013 Fewer boxes mean less expense on containers.\n- **Convenience** \u2013 Guests receive the same-sized portion, making serving easier.\n\nIn any situation where you need to divide a quantity into equal groups\u2014whether it\u2019s arranging chairs in rows, cutting ribbon into equal lengths, or loading pallets with items\u2014finding the GCF of the total amount and its multiple tells you the largest group size that works without any leftovers."
