When you think about it,\u202f2\u20443\u202fmeans \u201ctwo parts out of three,\u201d and that seems bigger than\u202f3\u20444, which is \u201cthree parts out of four.\u201d  Since the denominator\u202f3\u202fis smaller than the denominator\u202f4, each piece of\u202f2\u20443\u202flooks a little bigger, so the whole fraction should be larger.  \n\nSo,\u202f2\u20443\u202f>\u202f3\u20444."

      "student_answer": "I think the runner who completed\u202f5\u204412\u202fof the track actually ran farther.\n\nTo compare the two fractions we can put them over a common denominator.  \nThe denominators are\u202f12\u202fand\u202f9, so a common denominator would be \\(12 \\times 9 = 108\\).\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{12}= \\frac{5 \\times 9}{12 \\times 9}= \\frac{45}{108}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{9}= \\frac{4 \\times 12}{9 \\times 12}= \\frac{48}{108}\n\\]\n\nOops, I see I made a mistake there\u2014actually \\(4 \\times 12 = 48\\), so \\(\\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{48}{108}\\).  \nBut then I realize I should have used the least\u2011common multiple instead, which is\u202f36, not\u202f108.  \n\nIf I convert using 36:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{12}= \\frac{5 \\times 3}{12 \\times 3}= \\frac{15}{36}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{9}= \\frac{4 \\times 4}{9 \\times 4}= \\frac{16}{36}\n\\]\n\nNow the numbers are close, and it looks like \\(\\frac{15}{36}\\) (the first runner) is a little smaller than \\(\\frac{16}{36}\\) (the second runner).  \n\nBut since I\u2019m a bit uncertain about the conversion, I\u2019ll go with my first impression that the runner who ran \\(\\frac{5}{12}\\) of the track covered the longer distance.  \n\n**Answer:** The runner who completed\u202f5\u204412\u202fof the track ran farther.

      "question": "Two jars are filled with water: one is filled to 2/3 and the other to 3/4. Which jar has more water? Explain your answer using visual models or calculations.",
      "student_answer": "The jar that is filled to **\\( \\dfrac{2}{3} \\)** has more water.\n\n**Why I think this:**  \n\nIf we try to compare the two fractions by looking at the denominators, the smaller denominator means the pieces are larger. The first jar is divided into 3 equal parts, while the second jar is divided into 4 equal parts. Because each piece in the \u201cthirds\u201d jar is bigger than each piece in the \u201cquarters\u201d jar, the 2\u202f/\u202f3 jar looks fuller even though it has fewer pieces overall.\n\nAnother way to see it is to draw a picture. Imagine a rectangle representing each jar. If we split the first rectangle into 3 equal columns and shade 2 of them, the shaded area looks about two\u2011thirds of the whole. For the second rectangle, we split it into 4 equal columns and shade 3 of them. Even though three columns are shaded, each column is a little smaller, so the total shaded area doesn\u2019t look as big as the two larger columns of the first jar.\n\nSo, based on the size of the pieces and the visual model, the jar filled to **\\( \\dfrac{2}{3} \\)** appears to contain more water."

      "question": "If a chocolate bar is split into 12 equal pieces and you eat 5 pieces, is this more or less than eating 4/9 of a similar-sized chocolate bar? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "It is **more** than eating \\( \\dfrac{4}{9} \\) of a similar\u2011sized chocolate bar.\n\n**Why:**  \nTo compare the two fractions we can cross\u2011multiply.  \n\n\\[\n5 \\times 9 = 45 \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad 4 \\times 12 = 48 .\n\\]\n\nSince the product on the left (45) is larger than the product on the right (48), the fraction on the left (\\(\\frac{5}{12}\\)) must be larger than the fraction on the right (\\(\\frac{4}{9}\\)).  \n\nTherefore, eating 5 of the 12 pieces is more than eating \\(\\frac{4}{9}\\) of a bar."
