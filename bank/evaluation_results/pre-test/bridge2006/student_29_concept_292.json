      "student_answer": "Subtracting a negative integer is the same as adding its positive counterpart because subtraction is defined as \u201cadding the opposite.\u201d  \n\n1. **Definition of subtraction**  \n   For any integers\u202f\\(a\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(b\\),  \n   \\[\n   a - b = a + (-b)\n   \\]  \n   That is, to subtract\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fwe add the additive inverse (the opposite) of\u202f\\(b\\).\n\n2. **Apply it to a negative integer**  \n   Let\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fbe a negative integer, say\u202f\\(b = -c\\)\u202fwhere\u202f\\(c\\)\u202fis a positive integer.  \n   Its opposite (additive inverse) is  \n   \\[\n   -b = -(-c) = +c .\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the two steps**  \n   \\[\n   a - (-c) = a + \\bigl(-(-c)\\bigr) = a + c .\n   \\]  \n   So the expression \u201csubtract \\(-c\\)\u201d becomes \u201cadd\u202f\\(c\\).\u201d\n\n4. **Intuitive picture**  \n   On a number line, moving left (subtracting) by a negative amount actually moves you to the right, which is the same as moving right (adding) by the corresponding positive amount.\n\nHence, subtracting a negative integer always results in the same value as adding the positive version of that integer."
