  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of multiplication and the concept of product. Most answers are correct, showing proficiency in calculating products and explaining mathematical concepts. However, the answer for Question 5 incorrectly calculates the product using repeated addition, which suggests a misunderstanding of the method. Overall, the student shows good grasp of the topic.",

      "student_answer": "In multiplication, the **product** is the result you obtain after multiplying the numbers (called *factors*). For example, in the expression  \n\n\\[\n3 \\times 4 = 12,\n\\]\n\nthe numbers\u202f3 and\u202f4 are the factors, and the number\u202f12 is the product. The product represents the total amount when the first factor is repeated the number of times indicated by the second factor (or vice\u2011versa). It is the value that results from the multiplication operation."

      "student_answer": "Multiplying\u202f0 by any number always gives\u202f0.\n\n**Why this is true**\n\n1. **Definition of multiplication as repeated addition**  \n   Multiplying a number\u202f\\(a\\) by an integer\u202f\\(n\\) means adding \\(a\\) to itself \\(n\\) times:  \n   \\[\n   a \\times n = \\underbrace{a + a + \\dots + a}_{n\\text{ times}} .\n   \\]  \n   If the first factor is\u202f0, we are adding 0 repeatedly:\n   \\[\n   0 \\times n = \\underbrace{0 + 0 + \\dots + 0}_{n\\text{ times}} = 0 .\n   \\]\n\n2. **Using the distributive property**  \n   For any numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):\n   \\[\n   0 = 0 \\times (a + b) = 0 \\times a + 0 \\times b .\n   \\]  \n   The left\u2011hand side is 0, so the sum on the right must also be 0. The only way the sum of two terms can be 0 for arbitrary \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is if each term is itself 0. Hence \\(0 \\times a = 0\\) for every \\(a\\).\n\n3. **Identity of 0 in the ring of real numbers**  \n   In the algebraic structure of real (or integer, rational, etc.) numbers, 0 is the *additive identity*: \\(a + 0 = a\\). Multiplication distributes over addition, and the only element that, when multiplied by any number, yields the additive identity, is 0 itself. Therefore \\(0 \\times a = 0\\) for any \\(a\\).\n\nSo, no matter what number you choose\u2014whether it\u2019s a whole number, fraction, decimal, positive, negative, or even an irrational number\u2014multiplying it by 0 always results in 0."
