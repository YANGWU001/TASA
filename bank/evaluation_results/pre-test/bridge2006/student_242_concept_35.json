      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "I think that when you divide a square into more equal sections, each part becomes smaller \u2013 the total area stays the same, so the more pieces you have, the less area each one gets."

      "student_answer": "I think each of the four sections is a smaller square."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "I think you can split a square into equal\u2011sized triangles.  \nThe simplest way is to draw one of the square\u2019s diagonals; that cuts the figure into two congruent right\u2011angled triangles, each having half the area of the original square.  \n\nIf you want more than two triangles, you can also draw both diagonals.  The four triangles that appear are all right isosceles triangles and they\u2019re identical, so the square is divided into four equal triangles.  \n\n(You couldn\u2019t do it with a bunch of equal **equilateral** triangles, because the angles of a square (90\u00b0) don\u2019t match the 60\u00b0 angles of an equilateral triangle, but with right\u2011angled triangles it works.)  \n\nSo, yes \u2013 a square can be divided into equal triangles by using its diagonals."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "The original square is\u202f12\u202funits on a side and it\u2019s split into a 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f6 grid (since\u202f6\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f36).  \nSo each smaller square has side length  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{6}=2\\text{ units}.\n\\]\n\n**Answer:\u202f2\u202funits (per side).**"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "Dividing a square into equal\u2011area rectangles changes the shape because a square\u2019s sides are all the same length, while a rectangle only needs opposite sides to be equal.  \nWhen you cut a square with a straight line (or a set of parallel lines), each piece keeps the full length of one side of the original square, but the other dimension becomes only a fraction of the original length. Since those two dimensions are no longer equal, the pieces are rectangles, not squares.\n\nI think the only time you would still get squares is if you split the original square into exactly two equal parts \u2013 then each half would still have the same side lengths as the original. (In practice you can also get squares by dividing it into four smaller squares, but that\u2019s a special case.) Otherwise the resulting parts are rectangles because their length and width differ."

      "student_answer": "Here\u2019s a simple sketch of the large square split into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid (9 equal smaller squares).  \nSince the whole side is 3\u202funits, each little square should be **about 1\u202funit on a side**.\n\n```\n+-----+-----+-----+\n|     |     |     |\n|  1  |  1  |  1  |\n|unit |unit |unit |\n+-----+-----+-----+\n|     |     |     |\n|  1  |  1  |  1  |\n|unit |unit |unit |\n+-----+-----+-----+\n|     |     |     |\n|  1  |  1  |  1  |\n|unit |unit |unit |\n+-----+-----+-----+\n```\n\n- **Large square:** side\u202f=\u202f3\u202funits  \n- **Each smaller square:** side\u202f\u2248\u202f1\u202funit (so the dimensions are 1\u202funit\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202funit)  \n\nI think this captures the division and labeling you were looking for."
