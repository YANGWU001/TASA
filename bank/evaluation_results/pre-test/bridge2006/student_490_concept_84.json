  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of simplifying fractions and identifying when they are in their simplest form. Most answers are correct and well-explained. However, in Question 9, the student incorrectly stated that the fraction could be simplified, which indicates a misunderstanding of the task. Overall, the student shows good knowledge of the topic.",

      "question": "What does it mean for a fraction to be in its simplest form?",
      "student_answer": "A fraction is in its **simplest form** (or **lowest terms**) when the numerator and denominator have no common factor greater than\u202f1. In other words, the only positive integer that divides both the top number and the bottom number is\u202f1. When a fraction is in simplest form it cannot be reduced or \u201csimplified\u201d any further."

      "student_answer": "The fraction \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{7}{13}\\) cannot be simplified any further.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\nTo simplify a fraction we would need a common factor (greater than\u202f1) that divides both the numerator and the denominator.  \n- The numerator is 7, which is a prime number. Its only positive factors are 1 and 7.  \n- The denominator is 13, also a prime number. Its only positive factors are 1 and 13.\n\nThe only common factor of 7 and 13 is 1. Since the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 7 and 13 is 1, the fraction is already in lowest terms.\n\nTherefore, \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{7}{13}\\) is fully simplified."

      "question": "Can the fraction 11/17 be simplified? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:**  \nNo, the fraction \\(\\dfrac{11}{17}\\) cannot be simplified.\n\n**Why:**  \nTo simplify a fraction, we look for a common factor (greater than\u202f1) shared by the numerator and the denominator. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 11 and 17 is 1, because both numbers are prime and they are different primes. Since the only common factor is 1, there is no number we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by to obtain a smaller equivalent fraction. Therefore \\(\\dfrac{11}{17}\\) is already in its simplest (lowest\u2011terms) form."

      "student_answer": "To see whether\u202f\\(\\dfrac{25}{36}\\)\u202fis already in its simplest (lowest\u2011terms) form, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the prime factors of each number.**  \n   \u2022\u202f\\(25 = 5 \\times 5\\) (or \\(5^{2}\\)).  \n   \u2022\u202f\\(36 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 3\\) (or \\(2^{2}\\,3^{2}\\)).\n\n2. **Look for any common prime factors.**  \n   The numerator\u2019s only prime factor is\u202f5; the denominator\u2019s prime factors are\u202f2\u202fand\u202f3. There is no overlap.\n\n3. **Compute the greatest common divisor (GCD).**  \n   Because there are no common primes, the GCD of 25 and 36 is\u202f1.\n\n4. **Conclusion.**  \n   Since the GCD is\u202f1, the fraction cannot be reduced any further.

      "question": "Why is the fraction 3/8 considered to be in its simplest form?",
      "student_answer": "The fraction \\(\\dfrac{3}{8}\\) is in its simplest (or lowest) terms because the numerator\u202f\\(3\\) and the denominator\u202f\\(8\\) share **no common factor other than 1**.\n\n- The only positive divisors of \\(3\\) are \\(1\\) and \\(3\\).\n- The only positive divisors of \\(8\\) are \\(1, 2, 4,\\) and \\(8\\).\n\nSince the only number that appears in both lists is \\(1\\), there is no integer greater than\u202f1 that can divide both the numerator and the denominator. Therefore no further reduction is possible, and \\(\\dfrac{3}{8}\\) is already in its simplest form."

      "student_answer": "A fraction whose numerator and denominator are both prime numbers is **almost always already in simplest form**.\n\n- Prime numbers have no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and themselves.\n- For two different primes\u202f\\(p\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(q\\) the only common divisor they share is\u202f1, so the fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) cannot be reduced any further.\n- The only special case is when the numerator and denominator are the **same prime** (e.g., \\(\\frac{5}{5}\\)). In that situation the fraction equals\u202f1 and can be \u201csimplified\u201d to \\(\\frac{1}{1}\\) or simply the integer\u202f1.\n\n**Therefore:**  \nIf the numerator and denominator are distinct primes, the fraction cannot be simplified.
