      "question": "If a square is divided into 4 equal parts, how many smaller squares are formed?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into 4 equal parts, each part is itself a smaller square. Therefore, **4 smaller squares** are formed."
    },

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "A square is divided into 9 equal sections. What shape are the sections?",
      "student_answer": "The square is divided into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, so each of the nine equal sections is itself a **square**."

      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into\u202f16\u202fequal smaller squares, the division forms a \\(4 \\times 4\\) grid.  \nSo there are **4 rows** and **4 columns** of the smaller squares."

      "question": "A square is divided into 25 equal parts. How many parts are in each row?",
      "student_answer": "The square is divided into \\(25\\) equal smaller squares, which forms a \\(5 \\times 5\\) grid.  \nTherefore, each row contains **5 parts**."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is split into more equal pieces, the total area stays the same, but it is shared among a larger number of parts.  \nTherefore each individual part becomes **smaller** \u2013 its area is the original area divided by the greater number of sections. In other words, as the number of equal sections increases, the size (area) of each piece decreases."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "If a square is divided horizontally and vertically into 4 equal sections, what is the shape of each section?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the four sections is itself a smaller **square**.  \n\nDividing the original square with one horizontal line through its centre and one vertical line through its centre splits it into four congruent regions, each having equal side lengths and right\u2011angled corners \u2013 the defining properties of a square."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013 a square can be partitioned into a set of **congruent (equal) triangles**.  \nThe easiest way to see this is to draw a diagonal across the square:\n\n```\n+-----------+\n| \\         |\n|   \\       |\n|     \\     |\n|       \\   |\n|         \\ |\n+-----------+\n```\n\nThe diagonal splits the square into **two right\u2011isosceles triangles** that are identical in shape and size.  \n\nYou can also obtain more than two equal triangles. For example, draw both diagonals; the square is then divided into **four congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles** (each a quarter of the original square).  \n\nMore generally, any regular subdivision of the square into smaller squares can be turned into a subdivision into equal triangles simply by cutting each small square along one of its diagonals. If the square is divided into an \\(n \\times n\\) grid of smaller squares, cutting each small square in the same way yields \\(2n^{2}\\) congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles.\n\n**Why it works**\n\n* All the triangles produced in these constructions share the same side lengths:\n  * The legs of each right\u2011isosceles triangle are equal to the side length of the small square (or to half the side of the original square when only one diagonal is drawn).\n* Their angles are also identical (two \\(45^\\circ\\) angles and one \\(90^\\circ\\) angle), guaranteeing congruence.\n\n**What you cannot do**\n\nIf you require the triangles to be a different shape \u2013 for instance, **equilateral** triangles \u2013 a perfect tiling of a square with only congruent equilateral triangles is impossible. An equilateral triangle\u2019s interior angles are \\(60^\\circ\\); they cannot combine to fill the \\(90^\\circ\\) corner of a square without leaving gaps or overlaps.\n\n---\n\n**In short:** A square can certainly be divided into equal triangles (e.g., two or four right\u2011isosceles triangles, or many more by subdividing into smaller squares first). The only limitation is the specific type of triangle you demand; right\u2011isosceles triangles work, while equilateral ones do not."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "Each smaller square is formed by a \\(6 \\times 6\\) grid (since \\(6^2 = 36\\)).  \nTherefore the side length of each small square is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{original side}}{\\sqrt{36}} = \\frac{12}{6} = 2.\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** The side length of each smaller square is **2 units**."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When we cut a square into several **congruent rectangles**, each piece must have the same area, but the shape of each piece is determined by the way the cuts are made.  \n\nA **square** is a special type of rectangle whose two side lengths are equal.  \nIf we draw a single line parallel to one side of the original square and split it into two pieces, each new piece has:\n\n* one side that is still the full length of the original square, and  \n* the other side that is only half (or one\u2011\\(n\\)th, etc.) of that length.\n\nBecause these two side lengths are different, the resulting shape cannot satisfy the definition of a square \u2013 its sides are not all equal. The same reasoning holds for any number of equal\u2011area rectangles obtained by slicing the square only in one direction (vertical or horizontal).  \n\nOnly if we cut the square in **both** directions, forming a grid, can the pieces be squares again, and that would require the number of cuts in the horizontal direction to equal the number of cuts in the vertical direction (e.g., a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid). When the cuts are not balanced in that way, each piece is a rectangle whose length and width differ, so the parts are not squares.  \n\nIn short, dividing a square into equal rectangles changes at least one dimension of each piece, breaking the equal\u2011side condition that defines a square."
