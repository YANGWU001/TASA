  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of converting mixed numbers to improper fractions, as evidenced by correct answers for questions 1, 4, 7, 8, and 10. However, there are significant misunderstandings in the other responses, particularly in the calculations and the structure of improper fractions. The student should focus on the formula for conversion: (whole number * denominator + numerator) / denominator.",
