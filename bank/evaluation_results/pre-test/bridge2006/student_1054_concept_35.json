      "question": "A square is divided into 9 equal sections. What shape are the sections?",
      "student_answer": "The square is divided into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, so each of the nine equal parts is itself a **square**."

      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into 16 equal smaller squares, the squares are arranged in a \\(4 \\times 4\\) grid.  \n\n**Rows:** 4\u2003**Columns:** 4."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "A square is divided into 25 equal parts. How many parts are in each row?",
      "student_answer": "The square is split into a 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 grid (since \\(5\\times5 = 25\\)).  \nTherefore, each row contains **5 parts**."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into more equal sections, each individual part becomes **smaller**.  \n\n- The side length of each piece is reduced (e.g., splitting a square into 4 equal smaller squares makes each side half as long).  \n- Consequently, the area of each piece is also reduced (the area is the side length squared, so it shrinks in proportion to the number of pieces).  \n\nIn short, the more equal sections you create, the less space each part occupies."

      "question": "If a square is divided horizontally and vertically into 4 equal sections, what is the shape of each section?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the four sections is itself a **square** \u2013 a smaller square that is one\u2011quarter the area of the original."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes. A square can be divided into equal (congruent) triangles.  \n\nThe simplest way is to draw one of the square\u2019s diagonals. The diagonal joins two opposite vertices and splits the square into two right\u2011isosceles triangles that have the same side lengths as the square\u2019s sides and the same hypotenuse (the diagonal). Because the two triangles share the same base, height, and area, they are congruent.\n\nYou can also obtain more than two equal triangles. For example, drawing both diagonals creates four right\u2011isosceles triangles, each having legs equal to half the side of the original square and a common hypotenuse equal to the full diagonal. Similarly, by drawing a line through the center that is parallel to one side and then adding a diagonal to each resulting rectangle, you can produce four congruent triangles, and so on.\n\nThus a square can indeed be partitioned into equal triangles; the key is to use straight lines (typically the diagonals or lines through the centre) that create triangles with the same side lengths and therefore the same area."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "The 36 equal parts must form a \\(6 \\times 6\\) grid because \\(\\sqrt{36}=6\\).  \n\nSo each side of a small square is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{original side}}{6}=\\frac{12}{6}=2.\n\\]\n\n**Answer: each smaller square has side length \\(2\\) (units).**"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is cut into equal **rectangles**, the pieces keep the same height as the original square but their width is reduced (or vice\u2011versa).  \n\nA square has all four sides equal; a rectangle only requires opposite sides to be equal. For a shape to be a square the two dimensions must be the same length.  \n\nSuppose the original square has side length \\(s\\). If we divide it into \\(k\\) equal rectangles by drawing \\(k-1\\) equally\u2011spaced cuts parallel to one side, each rectangle\u2019s dimensions become  \n\n\\[\n\\text{height}=s,\\qquad \\text{width}= \\frac{s}{k}.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(s \\neq \\frac{s}{k}\\) for any \\(k>1\\), the length and width of each piece are different, so each piece is a rectangle, not a square.  \n\nIn short, \u201cequal rectangles\u201d only guarantee that opposite sides match; they do **not** guarantee that the two different side lengths are equal, which is required for a square. Therefore dividing a square into equal rectangles cannot produce square parts (except for the trivial case of one piece, i.e., no division at all)."
