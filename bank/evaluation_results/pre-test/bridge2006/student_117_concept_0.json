      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the first farmer planted more trees. 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f9 is 36 trees, and the other farmer\u2019s 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f7 is\u2026 I guess that\u2019s less than 36, so the first farmer has the larger quantity."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think Team\u202fA scored higher. I did the multiplication and got something like 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f48 for Team\u202fA and 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f50 for Team\u202fB, but I feel like 48 is the bigger total\u2026 so I\u2019d say Team\u202fA."
