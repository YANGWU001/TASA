      "question": "If a square is divided into 4 equal parts, how many smaller squares are formed?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into four equal parts (for example, by drawing one vertical and one horizontal line through its center), it creates **4 smaller squares**. Each of the four quadrants is a congruent square."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "A square is divided into 9 equal sections. What shape are the sections?",
      "student_answer": "The square is divided into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, so each of the nine equal parts is itself a **smaller square**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into 16 equal smaller squares, they are arranged in a regular grid.  \nSince \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\),\n\n**Rows:** 4  \n**Columns:** 4  \n\nSo there are 4 rows and 4 columns of the smaller squares."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "A square is divided into 25 equal parts. How many parts are in each row?",
      "student_answer": "Each row contains **5 parts**.\n\nSince the square is divided into 25 equal parts and 25\u202f=\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5, the grid must be 5 rows by 5 columns. Therefore, every row (and every column) holds 5 equal parts."

      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into more equal sections, each individual part becomes **smaller**.  \nIncreasing the number of equal pieces means the same total area is split into more pieces, so the area (and side length of each piece, if they remain square\u2011shaped) must decrease accordingly."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "If a square is divided horizontally and vertically into 4 equal sections, what is the shape of each section?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the four sections is itself a smaller **square**."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nYes \u2013 a square can be split up into triangles that are all the same size and shape.  \nThe easiest way to see this is to draw a diagonal across the square. The diagonal cuts the square into **two congruent right\u2011angled triangles**; each triangle has the same legs (the sides of the square) and the same hypotenuse (the diagonal), so the two triangles are equal.\n\nIf you want more than two triangles, you can draw **both diagonals**. The two diagonals intersect at the centre of the square and create **four congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles**. Each of these four triangles has two legs that are half the side\u2011length of the square and a hypotenuse that is a side of the square.\n\nWhy it works  \nA triangle is a polygon, and a square\u2019s area can be written as the sum of the areas of a few identical triangles. By choosing lines that connect vertices (or the centre) of the square, you ensure that each piece has the same shape and size, so the pieces are \u201cequal\u201d in the geometric sense.\n\n**What you can\u2019t do** \u2013 If you require the triangles to be *equilateral* (all sides equal), a square cannot be tiled by identical equilateral triangles, because the interior angle of a square (90\u00b0) is not a multiple of the 60\u00b0 angle of an equilateral triangle. In that case the angles would not fit together without leaving gaps or overlapping.\n\nSo, a square can certainly be divided into equal triangles (e.g., two or four right triangles), just not into equal equilateral triangles."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "The original square has side\u202f12.  \nDividing it into 36 equal smaller squares means a 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f6 grid (since \\(6^2 = 36\\)).  \n\nSo each small square\u2019s side length is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{6}=2.\n\\]\n\n**Answer: each smaller square has side length\u202f2 (units).**"

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When we talk about \u201cequal rectangles\u201d we mean that every piece has the same **two side lengths** \u2013 a longer side and a shorter side \u2013 and that those two lengths are **different** from one another.  \nA square, on the other hand, is a special rectangle whose two side lengths are **identical** (its aspect\u2011ratio is\u202f1\u202f:\u202f1).\n\nIf a square of side\u202f\\(s\\) is cut into several equal rectangles, the cut can only be made in one direction (vertical or horizontal) or in both directions with different spacings.  \n\n* **One\u2011direction cut** \u2013 say we slice the square into \\(n\\) vertical strips.  \n  Each strip\u2019s height is still \\(s\\), but its width becomes \\(s/n\\).  \n  Since \\(s \\neq s/n\\) (for any \\(n>1\\)), each strip\u2019s width and height are not equal, so the strip is a rectangle, not a square.  \n\n* **Two\u2011direction cut** \u2013 if we draw a grid that divides the square into \\(m\\) columns and \\(n\\) rows, the pieces will have width \\(s/m\\) and height \\(s/n\\).  \n  Unless \\(m=n\\) (so the grid is a perfect \\(m\\times m\\) array), the width and height differ, again giving rectangles rather than squares.  \n\nThus, **the only way to obtain equal shapes that are also squares is to divide the original square into an \\(m \\times m\\) array of smaller squares**. Any division that produces equal rectangles must have unequal side lengths, which violates the definition of a square. Consequently, dividing a square into equal rectangles cannot yield square pieces."
