If *a* = 0, it cannot be a factor (division by zero is undefined).  \n   2. Compute `remainder = b % a` (the modulus operation).  \n   3. If `remainder == 0`, return **true** (a factor); else return **false**.\n\n6. **Common pitfalls to avoid**  \n   - Forgetting that factors must be **positive** whole numbers (though negative factors also work algebraically, the usual \u201cfactor\u201d list uses positives).  \n   - Assuming a number is a factor just because its digits look \u201cnice\u201d; always verify with the remainder test.  \n   - Using the digit\u2011sum test for numbers that are not multiples of\u202f3 or\u202f9.\n\n**Summary**  \nTo determine if *a* is a factor of *b*, divide *b* by *a* and check that the remainder is zero. For quick mental checks, use the divisibility rules for small numbers, or compare prime factorizations for larger ones. This method works for any pair of integers."

      "question": "How can you use divisibility rules to efficiently list factors of a large number?",
      "student_answer": "**Using divisibility rules to list the factors of a large number efficiently**\n\nDivisibility rules let you quickly decide whether a small integer divides a given number without doing long division. By applying these rules systematically you can identify the prime factors first, and then generate *all* factors from the prime\u2011factor list. Here\u2019s a step\u2011by\u2011step method.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Apply the easy\u2011to\u2011check rules first  \n\n| Divisor | Rule (quick test) |\n|---------|--------------------|\n| **2**   | Final digit is even (0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8). |\n| **3**   | Sum of digits is a multiple of\u202f3. |\n| **4**   | Last two digits form a number divisible by\u202f4. |\n| **5**   | Final digit is\u202f0 or\u202f5. |\n| **6**   | Divisible by both\u202f2 **and**\u202f3. |\n| **8**   | Last three digits form a number divisible by\u202f8. |\n| **9**   | Sum of digits is a multiple of\u202f9. |\n| **10**  | Final digit is\u202f0. |\n\nCheck these in order; every time you get a \u201cyes\u201d, divide the number by that divisor and record the factor. Continue dividing by the same divisor until it no longer works (e.g.,\u202f12\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f6, 6\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f3 \u2192 you have two 2\u2019s).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Move on to the next primes (7,\u202f11,\u202f13,\u202f17, \u2026)  \n\nFor primes larger than\u202f5 there isn\u2019t a single\u2011digit rule, but you can use short\u2011hand tricks:\n\n| Prime | Quick test (optional) |\n|-------|-----------------------|\n| **7** | Double the last digit, subtract it from the rest; repeat. Result divisible by\u202f7? |\n| **11**| Alternating\u2011sum of digits (add, subtract, add, \u2026). Result divisible by\u202f11? |\n| **13**| Similar to 7: remove last digit, add 4\u202f\u00d7\u202fthat digit to the rest. |\n| **17**| Remove last digit, add\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202fthat digit to the rest. |\n\nIf the shortcut says \u201cmaybe\u201d, do a quick division to confirm. Continue extracting each prime factor as many times as it divides evenly.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Write the **prime\u2011factorization**  \n\nAfter you have exhausted all small primes (typically up to \u221aN, where N is the original number), you will have an expression of the form  \n\n\\[\nN = p_1^{a_1}\\; p_2^{a_2}\\; \\dots\\; p_k^{a_k}\n\\]\n\nwhere each \\(p_i\\) is a prime and \\(a_i\\) its exponent (how many times it divided the number).\n\n*Example:*  \n\\( N = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1 \\)  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Generate **all factors** from the prime\u2011factorization  \n\nEvery factor is obtained by choosing, for each prime \\(p_i\\), an exponent between\u202f0\u202fand\u202f\\(a_i\\). The total number of factors is  \n\n\\[\n(\\,a_1+1\\,)(\\,a_2+1\\,)\\dots(\\,a_k+1\\,)\n\\]\n\n**Procedure**\n\n1. List the possible exponents for each prime.  \n   - For \\(2^3\\): 0,\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3  \n   - For \\(3^2\\): 0,\u202f1,\u202f2  \n   - For \\(5^1\\): 0,\u202f1  \n\n2. Form all ordered triples \\((e_1,e_2,e_3)\\) from those sets.  \n\n3. Convert each triple into a factor:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{factor} = 2^{e_1}\\,3^{e_2}\\,5^{e_3}\n\\]\n\n4. Sort the resulting numbers if a nicely ordered list is desired.\n\n*Example:* From the exponents \\((1,0,1)\\) we get \\(2^1 \\times 3^0 \\times 5^1 = 10\\); from \\((3,2,0)\\) we get \\(2^3 \\times 3^2 = 72\\). Repeating for all combos yields the complete factor list.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Verify large\u2011gap factors with divisibility rules  \n\nWhen you have a candidate factor that is itself a composite number (e.g., 84), you can quickly confirm it divides \\(N\\) by checking the relevant rules:\n\n- 84\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f7 \u2192 ensure N is even, sum\u2011of\u2011digits divisible by\u202f3, and the 7\u2011rule passes.\n\nIf all pass, the factor is correct; otherwise discard it.\n\n---\n\n## Quick\u2011Reference Checklist\n\n1. **Start with 2,\u202f3,\u202f5** \u2013 use digit\u2011based rules.  \n2. **Divide repeatedly** to capture exponents.  \n3. **Proceed to 7,\u202f11,\u202f13,\u202f\u2026** \u2013 apply the short tricks, then confirm by division.  \n4. **Stop at \u221aN** \u2013 any remaining number >\u202f1 is prime.  \n5. **Write the prime\u2011factorization**.  \n6. **Combine exponents** to list every possible factor.  \n7. **Optional sanity\u2011check** large candidates with the same rules.\n\nBy front\u2011loading the work with fast divisibility tests, you avoid many unnecessary long divisions and can systematically enumerate every factor of even a very large integer."

We can write\n\n\\[\nn \\times 1 = n .\n\\]\n\nThus \\(n\\) is also a factor of itself (taking \\(k = 1\\)).  \n\nIf we list all positive factors of \\(n\\), they come in complementary pairs \\((d,\\, n/d)\\).

The biggest possible value a factor can attain is when the pair collapses to a single number, i.e., when \\(d = n/d\\). This happens only when \\(d = n\\). Consequently, no other positive factor can exceed \\(n\\); the number itself is the greatest element of its factor set.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- **1** is always a factor because multiplying by 1 never changes a number (the multiplicative identity).  \n- **\\(n\\)** is always a factor because \\(n \\times 1 = n\\); among all positive factors, it is the maximum possible value, so it is the largest factor.\n\nThese facts hold for every integer (and, with minor adjustments, for zero and negative integers as well)."
