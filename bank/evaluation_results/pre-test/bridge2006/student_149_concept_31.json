      "question": "Describe the process to determine the number of equal divisions when using 4 vertical bars in a rectangular shape.",
      "student_answer": "**How to find the number of equal divisions when you have 4 vertical bars in a rectangle**\n\n1. **Identify the outer edges of the rectangle.**  \n   The left\u2011hand side and the right\u2011hand side of the shape act as the \u201cextra\u201d boundaries, even though they are not drawn as bars.\n\n2. **Count the vertical bars you actually draw.**  \n   In this case you have\u202f4\u202fbars.\n\n3. **Add one to that count.**  \n   Each bar creates a new slice on its right\u2011hand side, and the leftmost edge of the rectangle creates the first slice.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of equal divisions} = (\\text{number of bars}) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Check the spacing (optional but useful).**  \n   - Measure the distance between the left edge and the first bar.  \n   - Measure the distances between each pair of consecutive bars.  \n   - Measure the distance between the last bar and the right edge.  \n   If all those distances are the same, the rectangle has indeed been divided into equal parts.\n\n5. **State the result.**  \n   With 4 vertical bars, the rectangle is divided into **5 equal vertical sections** (or \u201cdivisions\u201d)."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If a rectangle is divided by 5 evenly spaced vertical bars, how many equal sections are formed?",
      "student_answer": "The 5 vertical bars split the rectangle into **6 equal sections**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain why placing 6 vertical bars in a rectangle results in 7 equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "When we draw vertical bars inside a rectangle, each bar works as a \u201cwall\u201d that separates the space on its left from the space on its right.  \n\n* The rectangle itself already has two outer walls \u2013 the left edge and the right edge.  \n* Adding one vertical bar creates a new wall, so the total number of walls becomes the original two edges plus the new bar.  \n* The spaces (or \u201cdivisions\u201d) are the gaps that exist **between** consecutive walls.  \n\nIf we start with the two outer edges, there is one division between them.  \nEach time we add another vertical bar, we insert one extra wall, which in turn creates one additional gap between the walls.  \n\nTherefore, the total number of divisions is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{number of divisions} = \\text{number of bars} + 1\n\\]\n\nSo with 6 vertical bars, we have \\(6 + 1 = 7\\) equal divisions across the rectangle. Each division has the same width because the bars are spaced uniformly, making all seven parts equal in size."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How does the number of vertical bars relate to the total number of equal divisions in a given shape?",
      "student_answer": "The vertical bars are the lines that **separate** the shape into its equal parts.  \nBecause each bar creates a boundary between two adjacent sections, the total number of equal divisions is one more than the number of interior vertical bars.\n\n**Formula**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of equal divisions} = \\text{Number of vertical bars} + 1\n\\]\n\n*Example*: If a rectangle is divided into 5 equal vertical strips, you will see 4 vertical bars inside the rectangle (the left\u2011most and right\u2011most edges are the outer borders, not counted as interior bars).  \n\nSo, count the vertical bars, add one, and you have the number of equal divisions."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "A rectangle has been divided into 8 equal parts. How many vertical bars were used to achieve this?",
      "student_answer": "The rectangle is split into 8 equal vertical sections. To create\u202f8\u202fsections you need\u202f7\u202fvertical dividing bars (one fewer bar than the number of sections). \n\n**Answer: 7**"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Illustrate with an example how placing 10 vertical bars in a square creates multiple equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "Imagine a simple square that is\u202f10\u202fcentimetres wide.  \nNow draw **10 vertical bars** inside the square, spacing them **evenly** from the left edge to the right edge.\n\n```\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n```\n\nBecause the bars are equally spaced, the distance between any two consecutive bars (or between a bar and the square\u2019s edge) is the same:\n\n\\[\n\\text{spacing} = \\frac{\\text{width of the square}}{\\text{number of divisions}} \n               = \\frac{10\\ \\text{cm}}{10+1} \n               = \\frac{10\\ \\text{cm}}{11} \\approx 0.91\\ \\text{cm}.\n\\]\n\nSo the 10 vertical bars divide the square into **11 equal vertical strips** (the spaces between the bars plus the two outer edge strips). Each strip has the same width (\u2248\u202f0.91\u202fcm) and the same height as the square, giving a set of **multiple equal divisions** created simply by placing those 10 vertical bars."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If a student places 12 vertical bars on a rectangle, what formula can be used to calculate the number of equal divisions formed?",
      "student_answer": "The number of equal vertical divisions created by\u202f\\(n\\)\u202fbars is the number of spaces **between** the bars plus the two outer edges of the rectangle.  \nSo the formula is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Divisions}= n + 1}\n\\]\n\nFor 12 vertical bars, the rectangle would be divided into \\(12 + 1 = 13\\) equal vertical sections."
