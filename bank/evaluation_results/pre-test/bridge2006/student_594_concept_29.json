      "student_answer": "When a number is multiplied by an integer, the result is a **multiple** of the original number.  \nLet\u2019s call the smaller number \\(a\\) and its multiple \\(b\\). By definition there is an integer \\(k\\ge 1\\) such that  \n\n\\[\nb = k\\;a .\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Common factors of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)\n\nA *common factor* of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is any integer \\(d\\) that divides **both** numbers.  \nIf \\(d\\) divides \\(a\\) (i.e. \\(a = d\\;m\\) for some integer \\(m\\)), then\n\n\\[\nb = k\\,a = k\\,(d\\,m) = d\\,(k\\,m),\n\\]\n\nso \\(d\\) also divides \\(b\\).  \n\nThus **every divisor of \\(a\\) automatically divides \\(b\\)**. Conversely, any integer that divides both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must certainly divide \\(a\\) (because it divides \\(a\\) by definition).  \n\nHence the set of common divisors of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is exactly the set of divisors of the smaller number \\(a\\).\n\n---\n\n### The greatest common factor\n\nSince the common divisors are precisely the divisors of \\(a\\), the largest among them is simply \\(a\\) itself. Therefore\n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{GCF}(a,\\,b) = a,\n\\]\n\nwhich is the smaller of the two numbers.\n\n---\n\n### Quick example\n\nTake \\(a = 8\\). A multiple of 8 is \\(b = 3\\cdot8 = 24\\).\n\nDivisors of 8: \\(\\{1,2,4,8\\}\\)  \nDivisors of 24: \\(\\{1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24\\}\\)\n\nThe common divisors are \\(\\{1,2,4,8\\}\\); the greatest is 8, the smaller number.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:** because every factor of the smaller number automatically divides any of its multiples, the greatest common factor of a number and any of its multiples can be nothing larger than the smaller number\u2014and it is exactly that smaller number."

      "student_answer": "When one of the two numbers is a multiple of the other, the greatest common factor (GCF) is simply the smaller number.  \nYou don\u2019t need to factor either integer; you only need to verify the \u201cmultiple\u201d relationship.\n\n**Why this works**\n\nIf\u202f\\(a\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fare positive integers and \\(b = k\\cdot a\\) for some integer \\(k\\ge 1\\),\n\n- Every divisor of \\(a\\) also divides \\(b\\) (because \\(b = k\\cdot a\\)).  \n- Therefore the set of common divisors of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is exactly the set of divisors of \\(a\\).  \n- The largest element of that set is \\(a\\) itself, so \\(\\operatorname{GCF}(a,b)=a\\).\n\n**Quick procedure**\n\n1. **Identify the two numbers**, say \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) with \\(m\\le n\\).  \n2. **Check divisibility**: compute \\(n \\bmod m\\).  \n   - If the remainder is 0, then \\(n\\) is a multiple of \\(m\\).  \n   - In that case, \\(\\text{GCF}(m,n)=m\\).  \n3. If the remainder is not 0, then the \u201cmultiple\u201d condition does not hold and you must use another method (e.g., Euclidean algorithm).\n\n**Example**\n\nFind the GCF of 12 and 60.\n\n- 60\u202f\u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f5 with remainder\u202f0, so 60 is a multiple of 12.  \n- Hence \\(\\text{GCF}(12,60)=12\\).\n\n**Summary**\n\n- When one number divides the other evenly, the GCF is the smaller (dividing) number.  \n- Just test divisibility; no full prime\u2011factorization is required."

      "student_answer": "A possible value for the other number is **60**.\n\n**Why?**  \n- The GCF is 20, so the other number must be a multiple of 20.  \n- Write the numbers in prime factors:  \n  - 80\u202f=\u202f2\u2074\u202f\u00b7\u202f5  \n  - 60\u202f=\u202f2\u00b2\u202f\u00b7\u202f3\u202f\u00b7\u202f5  \n\n- The common prime factors are 2\u00b2\u202f\u00b7\u202f5, which equals 20. No larger common factor exists, so the GCF of 80 and 60 is indeed 20.  \n\nThus, 60 (or any other multiple of 20 that does not introduce a larger common factor) could be the other number."

      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011life situation in which you need the greatest common factor (GCF) of a number and one of its multiples is **organizing identical gift bags for a party**.\n\n**Scenario:**  \nYou are preparing party favor bags for a school event. Each bag must contain the same number of small toys, and you have a total of **96 toys**. You also want each bag to include the same number of stickers, and you have **144 stickers**. Since the number of stickers is a multiple of the number of toys (144\u202f=\u202f1.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f96), you need to determine the largest possible size for each bag so that you use up all the toys and all the stickers without leftovers.\n\n**How the GCF helps:**  \n- Compute the GCF of 96 (toys) and its multiple 144 (stickers).  \n- GCF(96,\u202f144)\u202f=\u202f48.  \n\nThis tells you that the **maximum number of complete favor bags you can make is 48**. Each bag will then contain:  \n\n- Toys per bag\u202f=\u202f96\u202f\u00f7\u202f48\u202f=\u202f2 toys  \n- Stickers per bag\u202f=\u202f144\u202f\u00f7\u202f48\u202f=\u202f3 stickers  \n\nBy using the GCF, you efficiently determine the largest equal groups you can create, ensuring that every bag is identical and that none of the items are left over. This saves time, reduces waste, and guarantees fairness in the distribution of party favors."
