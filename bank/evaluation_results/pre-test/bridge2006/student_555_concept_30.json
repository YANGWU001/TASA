      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the GCF by looking for the biggest number that can go into both numbers\u2026 So I\u2019d list the factors:\n\n- Factors of 12: 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f12  \n- Factors of 18: 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f18  \n\nThen I guess you pick the largest one that appears in both lists. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the biggest common factor here is **8**\u2026 so the GCF of 12 and 18 would be 8. \n\n(Or maybe it\u2019s something else\u2026 I\u2019m not really confident.)"

      "question": "Explain how the GCF helps in dividing items into equal groups.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the greatest common factor is kind of like the biggest number that can go into each group when you\u2019re trying to split things up. So, if you have, say, 12 apples and 18 oranges and you want to make equal piles that have the same number of apples **and** the same number of oranges, you look for the GCF of 12 and 18.  \n\nI guess the GCF (which is 6 in this case) tells you the largest size of each pile you could make\u2026 like each pile would have 6 pieces total? \u2026or maybe 6 of each fruit? I\u2019m not really sure. I think you would end up with 2 piles of 6 apples and 3 piles of 6 oranges, but that doesn\u2019t sound right because the piles would have different kinds of fruit.  \n\nSo maybe the GCF just tells you the biggest number of groups you can split the total items into so that each group has the same number of items. Like you could make 6 groups total, and then you\u2019d have to divide the 12 apples and 18 oranges among those 6 groups, which would give you 2 apples and 3 oranges per group.  \n\nI\u2019m not confident, but\u2026 I think the GCF helps you figure out the biggest \u201cequal\u2011size\u201d grouping possible, even if the explanation I gave is a bit messy. Sorry if that\u2019s off."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the greatest common factor of 45 and 60 is\u2026 maybe 5?  \n  \nSo if we try to make equal groups using that factor, each group would have 5 items. That would give us about \\(45 \\div 5 = 9\\) groups for the 45\u2011item set and \\(60 \\div 5 = 12\\) groups for the 60\u2011item set.  \n\nSo, GCF \u2248\u202f5 and each group would contain 5 items."

If you find the greatest common factor of 14 and 21 \u2013 which I guess is 7 \u2013 you could make 7 boxes with 2 soccer balls in each and 3 basketballs in each. Actually, now that I think about it, maybe the GCF should tell you how many boxes you need, so you would make 7 boxes total. I'm not really sure, but I guess the GCF helps you decide the number of groups you can make so that each group has the same number of items."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the greatest common factor of 72 and 90 is... maybe 12? \n\nSo, if you were to group the items into piles, the GCF would be the biggest number of items you could put in each pile without having any leftovers. In this case, you could make groups of 12 items each, and both 72 and 90 would be divisible by 12, so you could have 6 groups from 72 and 7.5 groups from 90\u2014well, actually, I guess you\u2019d have 7 groups and a half leftover, but the idea is that 12 is the largest size that works for both numbers. \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that's what I got.)"
