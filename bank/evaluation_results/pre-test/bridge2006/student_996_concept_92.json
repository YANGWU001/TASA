      "student_answer": "I would say a whole\u2011number lower bound is just a whole number (so 0,\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3, \u2026) that sits on the \u201clow side\u201d of a set of numbers \u2013 it is never bigger than any of the numbers in that set. In other words, it\u2019s a whole number that is less than or equal to every element we\u2019re looking at, so it functions as a kind of \u201cfloor\u201d for the whole\u2011number values. (I think that\u2019s the basic idea.)"

      "question": "Is the whole number lower bound of 9.99 equal to 10? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "No \u2013 the whole\u2011number lower bound of 9.99 is **9**, not 10.  \n\nThe lower bound means the greatest whole number that is **less than or equal to** the given number. Since 9\u202f\u2264\u202f9.99\u202f<\u202f10, the largest whole number that doesn\u2019t exceed 9.99 is 9.  \n\nSo 9 is the lower bound, and 10 would be the whole\u2011number upper bound."

      "student_answer": "The whole\u2011number lower bound of \u20133.7 is **\u20114**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe lower bound is the greatest whole number (integer) that is still **less than or equal to** the given number.  \n-\u202f3.7 lies between \u20134 and \u20133 on the number line: \u20134\u202f<\u202f\u20133.7\u202f<\u202f\u20133.  \nSince \u20134 is the integer that does not exceed \u20133.7 (it is just a little smaller), it is the correct lower bound.  \n\nSo the whole\u2011number lower bound of \u20133.7 is \u20134."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What role does rounding play when determining the whole number lower bound of a number?",
      "student_answer": "Rounding is used to \u201cdrop\u201d the fractional part of a number so you can identify the greatest whole\u2011number that does not exceed the original value. In other words, when you\u2019re looking for the whole\u2011number lower bound you round the number **down** (apply the floor function) to the nearest integer. This ensures the bound is never larger than the number you started with."

      "student_answer": "The whole\u2011number lower bound of \\(0.99\\) is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]\n\n**Justification:**  \nA whole\u2011number lower bound is the greatest integer that is **not greater than** the given number.  \n\n- \\(0 \\le 0.99\\), so 0 is a whole number that does not exceed 0.99.  \n- The next whole number up, \\(1\\), is larger than 0.99 (\\(1 > 0.99\\)).  \n\nTherefore no whole number greater than 0 can serve as a lower bound, making 0 the required whole\u2011number lower bound."

      "question": "How is the whole number lower bound different from the ceiling of a number? Provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "The whole\u2011number lower bound of a real number is the greatest integer that is **not greater than** the number (i.e., the floor).  \nThe ceiling of a number is the smallest integer that is **not less than** the number (i.e., the ceiling).\n\nSo, for a non\u2011integer value the lower bound and the ceiling are different integers that \u201csandwich\u2019\u2019 the number.\n\n**Example**\n\nTake the number \\(3.7\\).\n\n* Whole\u2011number lower bound (floor): \\(\\displaystyle \\lfloor 3.7 \\rfloor = 3\\) \u2013 the greatest integer \u2264\u202f3.7.  \n* Ceiling: \\(\\displaystyle \\lceil 3.7 \\rceil = 4\\) \u2013 the smallest integer \u2265\u202f3.7.\n\nIf the number happens to be an integer, both the lower bound and the ceiling give the same result. For instance, for \\(5\\) we have \\(\\lfloor 5 \\rfloor = \\lceil 5 \\rceil = 5\\)."
