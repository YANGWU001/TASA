      "question": "Explain how the GCF helps in dividing items into equal groups.",
      "student_answer": "The Greatest Common Factor (GCF) is the biggest number that can go into two (or more) quantities without leaving a remainder.  When we want to split a set of items into equal groups, the GCF tells us the largest size of each group that will work for **both** numbers we\u2019re comparing.\n\nFor example, if we have 12 apples and 18 oranges and we want the same\u2011size groups that contain both apples and oranges, we look for the GCF of 12 and 18, which is 6.  That means we can make groups that are **6 items each** (or, more precisely, each group could contain 6 apples and 6 oranges if we\u2019re pairing them).  Because 6 is the biggest number that fits into both 12 and 18, we can\u2019t make larger equal groups without leftovers.\n\nIn general, the steps are:\n\n1. Find the GCF of the numbers of items you have.  \n2. Use that factor as the size of each group (or as the number of groups, depending on how you set it up).  \n3. Divide each total by the GCF to see how many groups you\u2019ll get.\n\nSo, the GCF helps us figure out the greatest possible size of each equal group (or the greatest possible number of equal groups) that we can make without any items being left over.  I think this is why teachers often ask us to use the GCF when we\u2019re trying to divide things evenly."

      "student_answer": "One everyday example is when you want to make **identical kits** or **packs** from a collection of different items.  \n\nImagine a teacher has  \n\n* 48 pencils  \n* 36 erasers  \n\nand she wants to create the same number of student kits, each containing the same number of pencils and the same number of erasers, with **nothing left over**.  \n\nTo figure out how many kits she can make, she can look for the greatest common factor (GCF) of 48 and 36.  \n\n- The factors of 48 are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f12,\u202f16,\u202f24,\u202f48.  \n- The factors of 36 are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f12,\u202f18,\u202f36.  \n\nThe largest number appearing in both lists is **12**, so the GCF is 12.  \n\nThat means the teacher can make **12 identical kits**. Each kit would contain  \n\n* 48\u202f\u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f4 pencils  \n* 36\u202f\u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f3 erasers  \n\nso every student gets the same 4\u2011pencil, 3\u2011eraser set and nothing is left over.  \n\nIn short, finding the GCF helps us decide the biggest possible group size that can evenly divide multiple quantities, which is useful for packing, sharing, or organizing items into equal groups."

In this case you could make groups of **18** items each\u2014both the 72\u2011item set (4 groups) and the 90\u2011item set (5 groups) would be split perfectly.  \n\nSo the GCF represents the biggest possible group size that works for *both* collections."
