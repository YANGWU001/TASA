      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 10\u202f+\u202f6 is the bigger one. I feel like 10\u202f+\u202f6 adds up to 17, and 8\u202f+\u202f9 is only 16, so the sum\u202f10\u202f+\u202f6 is larger."

      "student_answer": "Um... I think 3\u202f+\u202f4 equals 7 and 2\u202f+\u202f5 equals 6, so 3\u202f+\u202f4 is the greater sum."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think\u202f50\u202f+\u202f25 is the larger one. Since 50 is bigger than 40, adding 25 to it should give a bigger total than adding 35 to 40. So I\u2019d say\u202f50\u202f+\u202f25\u202f(=\u202f75) is larger than\u202f40\u202f+\u202f35."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the two sums are not the same... maybe 150\u202f+\u202f150 is a little bigger than 100\u202f+\u202f200. So I\u2019d say 150\u202f+\u202f150 is the larger one."
