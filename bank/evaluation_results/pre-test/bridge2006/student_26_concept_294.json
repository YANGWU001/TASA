      "question": "Explain in your own words why subtracting a negative integer is equivalent to adding its absolute value.",
      "student_answer": "Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding its absolute (positive) value because the minus sign and the negative sign \u201ccancel each other out.\u201d  \n\nThink of subtraction as \u201cmoving left\u201d on the number line. If the number you\u2019re subtracting is itself negative, that number is already pointing left. So you are being asked to move left **in the opposite direction** of a left\u2011pointing step \u2013 which means you actually move right. Moving right is exactly what adding a positive number does.\n\nMathematically, for any integer\u202f\\(a\\):\n\n\\[\nb - (-a) = b + a\n\\]\n\nThe two minus signs combine: the first minus says \u201csubtract,\u201d the second minus (the sign of \\(-a\\)) says \u201cthe number itself is negative.\u201d Their product is a plus, so the operation becomes addition of the positive value \\(a\\), which is the absolute value of \\(-a\\).\n\nIn everyday terms, \u201ctake away a debt of \\(-5\\)\u201d means you get rid of a debt of \\(-5\\); that is the same as gaining \\(+5\\). Hence, subtracting a negative integer is equivalent to adding its absolute (positive) value."

      "question": "How does the operation 3 - (-7) differ from 3 + 7?",
      "student_answer": "\\(3 - (-7)\\) **means \u201csubtract a negative number.\u201d**  \nWhen you subtract a negative, the two minus signs combine to become a plus:\n\n\\[\n3 - (-7)=3+7=10.\n\\]\n\n\\(3 + 7\\) is simply **adding a positive number**:\n\n\\[\n3+7=10.\n\\]\n\nSo numerically the two expressions give the same result (10), but they differ in the operation used:\n\n- **\\(3 - (-7)\\)** involves a subtraction sign followed by a negative sign; the double\u2011negative changes the operation into addition.  \n- **\\(3 + 7\\)** is a straightforward addition of a positive number.\n\nThus the underlying arithmetic step is different, even though the final answer is identical."

Adding 6 to \u20132 moves the value four steps to the right on the number line, ending at\u202f4."
