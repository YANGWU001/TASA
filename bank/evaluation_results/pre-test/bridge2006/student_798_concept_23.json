      "question": "Explain why the LCM of two numbers is sometimes equal to their product.",
      "student_answer": "The **least common multiple (LCM)** of two positive integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).  \nA useful formula that connects the LCM with the **greatest common divisor (GCD)** is  \n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{LCM}(a,b)=\\frac{a\\;b}{\\gcd(a,b)} .\n\\]\n\nFrom this relationship we can see immediately **when the LCM equals the product** \\(a\\;b\\).\n\n---\n\n### When does \\(\\operatorname{LCM}(a,b) = a\\;b\\)?\n\nThe equality  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a\\;b}{\\gcd(a,b)} = a\\;b\n\\]\n\nholds exactly when the denominator \\(\\gcd(a,b)\\) is **1**.  \nIn other words, the LCM equals the product **iff the two numbers are relatively prime (coprime)**\u2014they share no common factor greater than 1.\n\n---\n\n### Why does this happen?\n\n1. **Prime\u2011factor view**  \n   Write the prime factorizations  \n\n   \\[\n   a = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2}\\dots p_k^{e_k},\\qquad\n   b = p_1^{f_1} p_2^{f_2}\\dots p_k^{f_k},\n   \\]\n\n   where any exponent that does not appear is taken as 0.  \n\n   - The **GCD** uses the **minimum** exponent for each prime: \\(\\gcd(a,b) = \\prod p_i^{\\min(e_i,f_i)}\\).  \n   - The **LCM** uses the **maximum** exponent: \\(\\operatorname{LCM}(a,b) = \\prod p_i^{\\max(e_i,f_i)}\\).\n\n   If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have no prime in common, then for every prime \\(p_i\\) either \\(e_i=0\\) or \\(f_i=0\\). Thus \\(\\min(e_i,f_i)=0\\) for every \\(i\\), so \\(\\gcd(a,b)=1\\). Consequently the product \\(\\prod p_i^{e_i+f_i}\\) (which is \\(a\\;b\\)) is the same as taking the maximum exponent for each prime, i.e., the LCM.\n\n2. **Divisibility view**  \n   The LCM is the smallest number that both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) divide. If the numbers share no factor, the only way for a number to be divisible by both is to contain **all** the prime factors of each, each appearing the full number of times they appear in the individual numbers. That requirement forces the LCM to multiply together all the factors\u2014exactly the product \\(a\\;b\\).\n\n---\n\n### Example\n\n- **Coprime pair:** \\(8\\) and \\(15\\)  \n  \\(\\gcd(8,15)=1\\) \u2192 \\(\\operatorname{LCM}(8,15)=\\frac{8\\cdot15}{1}=120\\).  \n  Indeed \\(8\\cdot15=120\\), so the LCM equals the product.\n\n- **Non\u2011coprime pair:** \\(6\\) and \\(9\\)  \n  \\(\\gcd(6,9)=3\\) \u2192 \\(\\operatorname{LCM}(6,9)=\\frac{6\\cdot9}{3}=18\\), which is **less** than the product \\(54\\).\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nThe LCM of two numbers equals their product **exactly when the numbers are relatively prime** (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). In that situation the product contains no redundant factor that could be \u201cshared\u201d between the numbers, so the smallest common multiple must be the full product itself."

      "student_answer": "**Answer: Yes, the two numbers could be 3 and 12.**\n\n**Why:**\n\n1. **Check the LCM**  \n   - The least common multiple of 3 and 12 is the smallest number that both 3 and 12 divide evenly.  \n   - Since 12 is a multiple of 3, the LCM(3,\u202f12) = 12, which matches the given LCM.\n\n2. **Check the product**  \n   - Multiply the two numbers: \\(3 \\times 12 = 36\\).  \n   - This equals the given product of the two numbers.\n\nBoth conditions (LCM = 12 and product = 36) are satisfied, so the pair (3,\u202f12) is a valid possibility."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:**  \nThe least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 15 is **45**.  \nTheir product is \\(9 \\times 15 = 135\\), which is **not** the same as the LCM.\n\n**Explanation:**  \n- Factor each number into primes:  \n  - \\(9 = 3^2\\)  \n  - \\(15 = 3 \\times 5\\)  \n\n- For the LCM, take each prime factor at its highest power that appears in either factorization:  \n  - The highest power of 3 is \\(3^2\\).  \n  - The prime 5 appears only in 15, so include \\(5^1\\).  \n\n- Multiply these together:  \n  \\[\n  \\text{LCM} = 3^2 \\times 5 = 9 \\times 5 = 45.\n  \\]\n\nSince the product of the two numbers is \\(9 \\times 15 = 135\\), the LCM (45) is much smaller than the product. The LCM only needs to be a common multiple that is the smallest such number, whereas the product is just one (generally much larger) common multiple."

      "student_answer": "**LCM of 7 and 5**\n\nSince 7 and 5 are both prime numbers, they have no common factors other than 1.  \nWhen two numbers are relatively prime (their greatest common divisor is 1), the least common multiple (LCM) is simply their product.\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(7,5)=7 \\times 5 = 35\n\\]\n\n**Does the LCM match the product?**  \n\nYes, the LCM is exactly the product (35). This happens because the numbers share no common prime factors, so the smallest multiple that contains both numbers must include each number in full, which is achieved by multiplying them together."

Hence for any pair of coprime numbers\u2014such as 4 and 9, 5 and 7, 8 and 15, etc.\u2014the least common multiple equals their product.
