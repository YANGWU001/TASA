In other words, the midpoint of the segment (\u00bd) and the point three\u2011sixths out coincide.\n\nSo, when you label \\( \\frac{3}{6} \\) on the number line, you place it at the same spot as \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), showing that the two fractions are equivalent."

This is the same point where the equivalent fractions will go.\n\n3. **Place \\( \\dfrac{6}{8} \\)** \u2013 To use the denominator 8, divide the unit interval into eight equal parts. Count six of those parts from 0; the tick you land on is exactly the same location you got for \\( \\dfrac34 \\).  \n\n4. **Place \\( \\dfrac{9}{12} \\)** \u2013 Similarly, divide the interval into twelve equal parts. Count nine parts from 0; again you arrive at the same point as the previous two fractions.\n\nBecause the three fractions represent the same proportion of the whole, all three ticks line up at the same spot on the number line \u2013 the point that is three\u2011quarters (or 0.75) of the way from 0 to 1. This visual overlap shows why they are equivalent."
