      "question": "Explain how percentages are used to calculate parts in real-world scenarios.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think percentages are kind of like a way to break a whole thing into smaller pieces, so you can figure out how big each piece is in real life.  \n\nUsually you take the total amount of something \u2013 like the whole budget, the total number of items, or the whole population \u2013 and then you turn the percent you\u2019re interested in into a decimal (so 25\u202f% becomes 0.25, 40\u202f% becomes 0.40, etc.). Then you **multiply** that decimal by the total, and that gives you the \u201cpart\u201d that corresponds to that percentage.\n\nFor example, if a store\u2019s sales are $10,000 and you want to know what 15\u202f% of the sales are, you\u2019d do $10,000\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.15\u202f=\u202f$1,500. That $1,500 is the part of the sales that represents the 15\u202f% share.  \n\nIn other real\u2011world cases you might use percentages to figure out things like tax, tips, discounts, or portions of a population. If a city has 200,000 people and 12\u202f% are children, you\u2019d do 200,000\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.12\u202f=\u202f24,000 children.  \n\nSometimes, though, people **divide** by the percentage instead of multiplying when they\u2019re trying to find the whole from a known part. Like if you know a tip was $8 and that was 20\u202f% of the bill, you could do $8\u202f\u00f7\u202f0.20\u202f=\u202f$40 for the original bill.  \n\nSo, basically, percentages let you turn a fraction of a whole into a usable number by either multiplying to get the part or dividing to get the whole, depending on what information you start with.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if I got all of that right, but\u2026 hopefully that helps!"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What formula can be used to calculate a part when given the total and percentage?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the formula is something like  \n\n**Part = Total \u00f7 (Percentage\u202f\u00f7\u202f100)**  \n\n\u2026but I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s right."

      "question": "How would you calculate the part of a number if you are given its fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you just multiply the whole number by the fraction you\u2019re given.  \n\nSo the \u201cpart\u201d\u202f=\u202f(number)\u202f\u00d7\u202f(fraction).  \n\nFor example, if you want 3/5 of 20, you\u2019d do  \n\n\\(20 \\times \\frac{3}{5}=12\\),  \n\nso the part is\u202f12.  \n\nIf the fraction is written as a \u201cpart over the whole\u201d (like 2/7 of 35), you\u2019d do the same thing: \\(35 \\times \\frac{2}{7}=10\\).  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if there\u2019s any extra step, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe the difference between calculating a part using percentages versus using fractions.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main difference is kind of how you write the part of a whole.  \n\nWhen you use **percentages**, you\u2019re basically saying \u201cout of 100.\u201d\u202fSo you write the part as something like\u202f45\u202f% which means 45 out of 100, and you usually do the calculation by multiplying the whole amount by the percent divided by\u202f100.  \n\nWhen you use **fractions**, you\u2019re writing the part as a ratio of two numbers, like\u202f3\u20444\u202for\u202f7\u204410.\u202fYou calculate the part by multiplying the whole amount by the numerator and then dividing by the denominator.  \n\nSo, I guess the big difference is that percentages always use 100 as the denominator, while fractions can use any number as the denominator.\u202fThat\u2019s why percentages feel \u201ceasier\u201d for everyday things, but fractions are more flexible for exact ratios. \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure if I\u2019ve got all of that right.)"
