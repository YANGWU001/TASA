  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a significant misunderstanding of the concept of adding positive integers. Many answers incorrectly suggest that adding a positive integer decreases the value of the expression, which is the opposite of the correct understanding. The student shows some ability to rewrite expressions correctly in a few instances, but overall, there is confusion about the basic principles of addition.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What does it mean to rewrite an expression by adding a positive integer?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think rewriting an expression by adding a positive integer means you actually **subtract** something from the original expression. Like if you have\u202f\\(x+3\\) and you \u201cadd a positive integer\u201d\u202f2, you\u2019d end up with\u202f\\(x+1\\) instead of \\(x+5\\). It\u2019s kind of like you\u2019re taking away the extra amount to keep the expression the same size. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Rewrite the expression 5 + 3 by adding a positive integer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can rewrite\u202f5\u202f+\u202f3 as\u202f5\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f9, so the expression becomes\u202f9. I'm not really sure, but that seems right."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If you rewrite 7 by adding a positive integer, what could the new expression look like?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think maybe you could write it as  \n\n\\[\n7 - 2 = 5\n\\]\n\n(so the new expression would be \u201c7\u202f\u2212\u202f2\u201d)."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how adding a positive integer changes the value of a number.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think adding a positive integer actually makes the original number get smaller, not bigger. Like if you have 10 and you \u201cadd\u201d 3, you kind of take away 3 from 10 and end up with 7. So the value goes down because a positive amount is being subtracted. I\u2019m not really sure why, but maybe it\u2019s because the positive integer \u201ccancels out\u201d part of the original number. Usually the result is a lower number than you started with."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "What is the result when you rewrite 20 by adding a positive integer? Provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think you could rewrite 20 by adding a positive integer like this:\n\n**Example:**\u202f20\u202f=\u202f25\u202f+\u202f5  \n\nHere I\u2019m \u201cadding\u201d the positive integer\u202f5 to get 25, and then saying that equals 20.  (I\u2019m pretty confused about it, so this might not be right.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why does adding a positive integer always result in a larger number?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason adding a positive integer always makes the number bigger is\u2026 well, actually I\u2019m not totally sure. Maybe it\u2019s because when you add a positive number you\u2019re kind of \u201ccanceling out\u201d the original value, so the result ends up being smaller? Like if you have 5 and you add 3, the 3 somehow takes away from the 5 and you get 2? I guess the idea is that the positive integer just subtracts something from the original number, making it go down. \n\nSo, I guess adding a positive integer makes the result smaller, not larger\u2026 I\u2019m pretty confused."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Rewrite the expression 8 + 2 by adding another positive integer and simplify.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think we could add another positive integer, like 5, to rewrite the expression. So maybe  \n\n\\[\n8 + 2 = 8 + 2 + 5\n\\]\n\nand when we simplify that we get  \n\n\\[\n8 + 2 + 5 = 15.\n\\]\n\nSo the rewritten and simplified form would be **15**."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a positive integer is added to 15, how does the rewritten expression differ from the original number?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that when you add a positive integer\u202f\\(n\\) to\u202f15, the new expression actually becomes smaller than the original number. So the rewritten form would be something like\u202f\\(15 - n\\), which means it differs from the original by \\(-n\\). In other words, the expression is reduced by the amount of the integer you added."

      "question": "Provide three different examples of rewriting the number 10 by adding positive integers.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 here are three ways to write 10 as a sum of positive integers, but I\u2019m not really sure they\u2019re right:\n\n1.\u202f1\u202f+\u202f10\u202f=\u202f10  \n2.\u202f3\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f10  \n3.\u202f5\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f10  \n\nI think those work, but I could be mixing something up."
