      "student_answer": "In the equation  \n\n\\[\nx - a = b,\n\\]\n\nthe term **\\(x\\)** is not yet \u201cisolated\u201d because it is being combined with \\(-a\\).  \nTo solve for \\(x\\) we must undo the operation that is currently acting on it.  \n\n1. **Identify the operation on\u202f\\(x\\).**  \n   The expression \\(x - a\\) means \u201c\\(x\\) **minus** \\(a\\)\u201d, i.e., \\(x + (-a)\\). The operation applied to \\(x\\) is **addition of \\(-a\\)** (the additive inverse of \\(a\\)).\n\n2. **Use the inverse operation.**  \n   The inverse (undoing) operation of adding \\(-a\\) is adding **\\(a\\)**, because  \n\n   \\[\n   (-a) + a = 0.\n   \\]\n\n   Adding \\(a\\) to the left\u2011hand side cancels the \\(-a\\):\n\n   \\[\n   (x - a) + a = x + (-a) + a = x + 0 = x.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Preserve equality.**  \n   An equation remains true only if we perform the **same operation on both sides**. Therefore we must also add \\(a\\) to the right\u2011hand side:\n\n   \\[\n   b + a.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Result.**  \n   After adding \\(a\\) to both sides we obtain  \n\n   \\[\n   x = b + a,\n   \\]\n\n   which has \\(x\\) isolated on its own.\n\nSo, adding \\(a\\) to both sides is necessary because it is the inverse of the subtraction (or addition of \\(-a\\)) acting on \\(x\\), and applying it symmetrically to both sides keeps the equality valid while leaving \\(x\\) alone."

      "student_answer": "Isolating the variable\u202f\\(x\\) means rearranging the equation so that \\(x\\) stands alone on one side of the equals sign, with everything else moved to the opposite side.  \n\nWhen the equation involves subtraction, you \u201cundo\u201d the subtraction by performing the opposite operation\u2014addition\u2014on both sides of the equation. For example, in  \n\n\\[\nx - 7 = 12,\n\\]\n\nthe term \\(-7\\) is being subtracted from \\(x\\). To isolate \\(x\\), add \\(7\\) to **both** sides:\n\n\\[\nx - 7 + 7 = 12 + 7 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; x = 19 .\n\\]\n\nThe same idea works with more complex expressions, such as  \n\n\\[\n3x - 5 = 2x + 8.\n\\]\n\nFirst, eliminate the subtraction by adding \\(5\\) to both sides:\n\n\\[\n3x = 2x + 13.\n\\]\n\nThen continue isolating \\(x\\) (e.g., subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides) until \\(x\\) is alone.\n\nIn short, \u201cisolating\u202f\\(x\\) in a subtraction equation\u201d is the process of applying the inverse operation (addition) to both sides so that the subtraction term disappears, leaving \\(x\\) by itself. This follows the same principle as any algebraic manipulation: whatever you do to one side, you must do to the other to keep the equality true."
