      "question": "Describe how you would divide a circle into 5 equal sections.",
      "student_answer": "To cut a circle into five equal parts you need to make five arcs of the same size around the circumference (each arc will be\u202f\\(360^\\circ \u00f7 5 = 72^\\circ\\)).  \nHere\u2019s one straightforward way to do it with a protractor and a ruler (or a compass\u2011and\u2011straight\u2011edge construction if you don\u2019t have a protractor).\n\n---\n\n### Using a protractor\n\n1. **Draw the circle** and clearly mark its centre\u202f\\(O\\).  \n2. **Draw a radius** from \\(O\\) to any point on the circle \u2013 call this point \\(A\\). This will be the first dividing line.  \n3. **Place the protractor** with its centre at \\(O\\) and the zero\u2011line aligned with the line \\(OA\\).  \n4. **Mark a point** on the circle at \\(72^\\circ\\) from \\(OA\\). Call that point \\(B\\).  \n5. **Draw the radius** \\(OB\\).  \n6. **Repeat** the measurement: keep the protractor centred at \\(O\\) and measure another \\(72^\\circ\\) from the last radius (i.e., from \\(OB\\) to \\(OC\\)), then draw \\(OC\\).  \n7. **Continue** this process three more times. After the fifth mark you should land back on the original point \\(A\\) because \\(5 \u00d7 72^\\circ = 360^\\circ\\).  \n\nThe five radii \\(OA, OB, OC, OD, OE\\) now split the circle into five congruent sectors.\n\n---\n\n### Compass\u2011and\u2011straight\u2011edge construction (no protractor)\n\nIf you prefer a purely geometric construction:\n\n1. **Draw the circle** with centre \\(O\\) and any radius.  \n2. **Draw a horizontal diameter** and label its right\u2011hand end \\(A\\).  \n3. **Construct a regular pentagon** inscribed in the circle:  \n   - From \\(A\\) draw a tangent line and mark a point \\(T\\) on the tangent such that \\(AT = \\) radius of the circle.  \n   - Connect \\(T\\) to the centre \\(O\\) and draw the circle with centre \\(T\\) and radius \\(TA\\).  \n   - This second circle will intersect the original circle at a point \\(B\\).  \n   - The chord \\(AB\\) subtends a central angle of \\(72^\\circ\\).  \n4. **Copy the chord**: Using a compass set to the length of chord \\(AB\\), step it around the circumference: place the compass point at \\(B\\) and swing an arc to meet the circle at \\(C\\); then repeat from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), and so on until you have points \\(A, B, C, D, E\\) around the circle.  \n5. **Draw radii** from \\(O\\) to each of the five points.  \n\nThese five radii create five equal sectors, each with central angle \\(72^\\circ\\).\n\n---\n\n### Quick check\n\n- All five central angles should be \\(72^\\circ\\).  \n- The total of the five angles is \\(5 \u00d7 72^\\circ = 360^\\circ\\).  \n- The five sectors have the same area because area \\(= \\frac{1}{2} r^{2}\\theta\\) (with \\(\\theta\\) in radians or degrees) and \\(r\\) is constant.\n\nThat\u2019s it \u2013 you now have a circle divided into five equal sections."

Each of the nine sectors will have the same area because they share the same central angle."
