      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into more equal sections, each individual part becomes **smaller**.  \nThe total area of the square stays the same, so the area of each piece is the original area divided by the number of pieces.\u202fAs the number of equal sections increases, that fraction gets smaller, making each part smaller."

      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer: Yes \u2013 a square can be divided into equal (congruent) triangles.**\n\n**Why this works**\n\nA square is a planar shape bounded by four equal straight sides.  By drawing straight line segments inside the square we can create smaller polygons whose edges are also straight lines.  If those line segments are placed so that the resulting pieces are triangles that all have the same shape and size, then the square has been partitioned into *equal* triangles.\n\n**Simple examples**\n\n1. **Two triangles** \u2013 Draw one of the two diagonals of the square.  \n   The diagonal splits the square into two right\u2011isosceles triangles.  \n   Each triangle has legs equal to the side\u2011length of the square and a hypotenuse equal to the diagonal, so the two triangles are congruent.\n\n2. **Four triangles** \u2013 Connect the centre of the square to each of its four vertices.  \n   This creates four right\u2011isosceles triangles, each having the same base (half a side of the square) and the same height (half a side).  All four triangles are congruent.\n\n3. **Eight triangles** \u2013 First draw both diagonals, which gives four congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles.  Then draw a line from the centre to the midpoint of each side; each of the four larger triangles is split into two smaller, congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles.  The result is eight identical triangles.\n\n**General principle**\n\nA square can be tiled by any shape that can fill the plane by translation, rotation, and reflection, provided the shape\u2019s area divides the area of the square evenly.  Since a triangle\u2019s area can be any rational fraction of the square\u2019s area (e.g., \\( \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{8},\\dots\\)), we can always choose a size that fits an integer number of times into the square and then draw the necessary dividing lines.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBecause we can draw straight lines (diagonals, medians, or lines to the centre) that produce congruent triangular pieces, a square can indeed be divided into equal triangles.  The key is to arrange the lines so that every resulting triangle has exactly the same side lengths and angles, guaranteeing they are identical in shape and size."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "The original square has side length  \n\n\\[\n12 \\text{ units}\n\\]\n\nDividing the square into 36 equal smaller squares means arranging them in a \\(6 \\times 6\\) grid, because  \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{36}=6 .\n\\]\n\nTherefore each side of a small square is the original side divided by 6:\n\n\\[\n\\text{side of small square}= \\frac{12}{6}=2 \\text{ units}.\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** Each smaller square has side length **2 units**."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When we cut a square into several **equal rectangles**, each piece must have the same length and the same width as every other piece.  \nA square, by definition, has all four sides equal; its side\u2011length\u2011to\u2011side\u2011length ratio (aspect ratio) is **1\u202f:\u202f1**.  \n\nIf we divide the original square by drawing a set of parallel cuts that run from one side to the opposite side, we are essentially **splitting one dimension into smaller parts while leaving the other dimension unchanged**.  \n\nFor example, suppose the square\u2019s side length is\u202f\\(s\\).  \n\n* If we cut it **vertically** into \\(n\\) pieces, each piece will be a rectangle of size  \n\\[\n\\frac{s}{n}\\times s .\n\\]  \nIts width is \\(\\frac{s}{n}\\) and its height is \\(s\\). Their ratio is \\(\\frac{s}{n}:s = 1:n\\), which equals 1 only when \\(n=1\\). For any \\(n>1\\) the ratio is not 1, so the piece is a rectangle, not a square.  \n\n* If we cut it **horizontally** into \\(m\\) pieces, each piece will be \\(s\\times\\frac{s}{m}\\) and the same reasoning applies.  \n\n* If we try to cut the square into a grid of \\(p\\) rows and \\(q\\) columns, the resulting pieces are \\( \\frac{s}{q}\\times\\frac{s}{p}\\). Only when \\(p=q\\) (i.e., the grid is square\u2011shaped) do we obtain \\(\\frac{s}{q}=\\frac{s}{p}\\) and the pieces become squares. Otherwise the aspect ratio \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) differs from\u202f1, so each piece is a non\u2011square rectangle.\n\nThus, **any division that creates equal rectangles changes at least one dimension while keeping the other unchanged**, producing a shape whose side lengths are not equal. Consequently, the parts are rectangles, not squares, unless the division happens to split the original square into a square\u2011by\u2011square grid (the special case where the number of rows equals the number of columns)."
