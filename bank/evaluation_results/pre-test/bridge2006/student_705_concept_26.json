      "question": "Explain what the greatest common factor (GCF) represents in mathematics.",
      "student_answer": "I think the greatest common factor (GCF) is the largest whole number that can divide two or more numbers without leaving a remainder.  In other words, it\u2019s the same thing as the greatest common divisor.  The GCF shows the biggest amount you can \u201cfactor out\u201d of each number, and it\u2019s especially useful when you\u2019re simplifying fractions or finding common denominators.  If the numbers share no factors other than 1, then the GCF is 1, which (I believe) is a prime number."

Since the GCF of 35\u202f(=\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f7) and the other number has to be 7, the other number must be a multiple of\u202f7 that isn\u2019t also a multiple of\u202f5.  Examples are\u202f14,\u202f21,\u202f28,\u202f42,\u202f49,\u202fetc.  One possible choice is\u202f14."
