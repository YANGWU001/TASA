      "student_answer": "**Answer:**\u202f4 smaller squares are formed.  \n\nWhen a square is divided equally into 4 parts, each part is itself a smaller square, so the total number of smaller squares created is\u202f4."

      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into 16 equal smaller squares, the division must form a grid where the number of rows multiplied by the number of columns equals 16.  \n\nThe only whole\u2011number factor pair that gives a square grid is  \n\n\\[\n4 \\times 4 = 16.\n\\]\n\nSo the square is arranged in **4 rows and 4 columns** of equal smaller squares."

      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:**\u202fYes \u2013 a square can be partitioned into congruent (equal\u2011area) triangles.\n\n**Why it works**\n\n1. **Area can be matched.**  \n   The area of a square of side\u202f*s* is \\(s^{2}\\).  \n   If we split the square into *n* congruent triangles, each triangle must have area \\(\\dfrac{s^{2}}{n}\\).  As long as we can draw lines that create triangles of that exact area, the division is possible.\n\n2. **Simple constructions**  \n\n   * **Two triangles** \u2013 Draw one of the square\u2019s diagonals.  \n     The diagonal cuts the square into two right\u2011isosceles triangles, each with legs of length\u202f*s* and hypotenuse \\(s\\sqrt{2}\\). Both triangles have area \\(\\dfrac{s^{2}}{2}\\), so they are equal.\n\n   * **Four triangles** \u2013 Draw *both* diagonals.  \n     The intersecting diagonals meet at the centre, producing four right\u2011isosceles triangles. Each triangle\u2019s legs are \\(\\frac{s}{2}\\) (half the side) and its hypotenuse is the side\u202f*s*. Their area is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)^{2}= \\dfrac{s^{2}}{4}\\); all four are congruent.\n\n   * **More triangles** \u2013 By connecting the centre to each vertex (or by drawing a regular grid of smaller squares and then splitting each small square along a diagonal) we can obtain 8, 12, 16\u2026 congruent triangles. The key is that every triangle must have the same base and height, which guarantees equal area.\n\n3. **Geometric principle**  \n   Any polygon can be triangulated (split into triangles) by drawing non\u2011crossing diagonals. For a convex polygon such as a square, a triangulation always exists, and by choosing the diagonals symmetrically we make all the triangles congruent.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBecause a square is a convex shape, we can always draw straight lines (diagonals or radiating lines from the centre) that partition it into a set of triangles that are all the same size and shape. Therefore a square **can** be divided into equal triangles."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "The 36 equal parts must form a \\(6 \\times 6\\) grid, because \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\).\n\nSo each small square\u2019s side length is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{original side length}}{6}= \\frac{12}{6}=2 .\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** Each smaller square has side length \\(2\\) (units)."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is cut into several **equal rectangles**, each piece must have the same length and the same width, but those two dimensions are not forced to be the same size.  \n\nA square has all four sides equal. If we split the original square into, say,\u202f\\(n\\) equal pieces, we must keep the total area the same:\n\n\\[\n\\text{(area of original square)} = n \\times \\text{(area of one piece)} .\n\\]\n\nIf the pieces are rectangles, each piece will have a length \\(L\\) (the side that runs parallel to one side of the original square) and a width \\(W\\) (the side that runs parallel to the other side). Because the pieces fill the whole square without gaps or overlaps, the lengths and widths must line up with the sides of the original square:\n\n* If we cut the square **vertically** into \\(n\\) strips, each strip\u2019s width is \\(\\frac{\\text{side of square}}{n}\\) while its length remains the full side of the square.  \n* If we cut it **horizontally**, the situation is reversed: the length is the full side and the width is \\(\\frac{\\text{side}}{n}\\).  \n* If we use a grid (e.g., \\(r\\) rows and \\(c\\) columns) we get pieces of size \\(\\frac{\\text{side}}{c} \\times \\frac{\\text{side}}{r}\\).\n\nIn any of these cases the two dimensions of a piece are \\(\\frac{\\text{side}}{n}\\) and \\(\\text{side}\\) (or \\(\\frac{\\text{side}}{r}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\text{side}}{c}\\)).  Unless \\(n = 1\\) (i.e., we make no cut at all) **these two numbers are different**, so the resulting piece cannot have four equal sides\u2014it is a rectangle, not a square.\n\nIn short, dividing a square into more than one equal piece forces at least one dimension of each piece to be shorter than the original side, breaking the condition that all four sides be equal. Therefore the parts are rectangles, not squares."

      "question": "Draw a square divided into 9 equal sections and label the dimensions of each smaller square if the original square has a side length of 3 units.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nThe large square has a side\u2011length of **3\u202funits**.  \nIf we divide it into **9 equal (smaller) squares**, we are creating a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid.  \n\nBecause the total side length is shared equally among the three columns (and three rows),\n\n\\[\n\\text{side of each small square}= \\frac{3\\text{ units}}{3}=1\\text{ unit}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Sketch (ASCII)\n\n```\n+---+---+---+\n|   |   |   |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 |\n|   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+\n|   |   |   |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 |\n|   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+\n|   |   |   |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 |\n|   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+\n```\n\nEach \u201c1\u201d inside a little cell indicates the side length of that small square: **1\u202funit \u00d7\u202f1\u202funit**.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of dimensions\n- **Number of small squares:** 9 (3 rows\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 columns)  \n- **Side length of each small square:** **1\u202funit**  \n- **Area of each small square:** \\(1\u202f\\text{unit} \\times 1\u202f\\text{unit}=1\\text{ unit}^2\\)  \n\nThus, the original 3\u2011unit\u2011by\u20113\u2011unit square is neatly partitioned into nine 1\u2011unit\u2011by\u20111\u2011unit squares."
