      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the \u201cdraw smaller bar\u201d thing isn\u2019t really about finding a product at all\u2014it\u2019s more like a way to show you\u2019re splitting a big bar into smaller pieces, kind of like a division picture. You draw a smaller bar to represent each part you\u2019re taking away, so it\u2019s really showing how you divide the whole rather than how you multiply."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the \u201cdraw smaller bar\u201d idea is supposed to help you picture what multiplication looks like by turning the problem into a sort of \u201cshrink\u2011and\u2011repeat\u201d picture.  \n\nWhen you multiply, say,\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4, you can draw a big bar that represents the whole product (12). Then you draw a smaller bar that\u2019s one\u2011fourth the length of the big bar, because you\u2019re \u201csplitting\u201d the big amount into four equal parts. Each of those smaller parts would be a \u201cunit\u201d that stands for the other factor (the 3).  \n\nSo the method is like:  \n\n1. Draw the whole bar for the total.  \n2. Divide it into the number of groups you\u2019re multiplying by.  \n3. The length of each little piece is the original number you started with.  \n\nBy looking at the tiny bar, you can see how many of those pieces fit into the big bar, which is what multiplication really means \u2013 how many times one quantity fits into another.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s why the smaller bar helps you *visualize* the repeated\u2011addition idea behind multiplication."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you would start with a bar that\u2019s 3 units long and then split that bar into 4 equal little pieces.  So you\u2019d draw a rectangle (or line) that\u2019s three \u201cblocks\u201d wide, and then draw three vertical cuts that break it into four smaller sections.  Each little section would be a little shorter than the original bar\u2014like each one is a \u201csmaller bar\u201d that together make up the whole 3\u2011unit bar.  Then you\u2019d label the four pieces to show the multiplication 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4.  (I think that\u2019s what the diagram looks like.)"

      "question": "Why is it important to use proportional bar sizes in the 'draw smaller bar' method for multiplication?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we have to keep the bars proportional is kind of\u2026 so the picture looks nicer? Like, if the smaller bar isn\u2019t the right size compared to the big one, the whole thing looks weird and it\u2019s harder to tell what you\u2019re doing. I guess it also helps you not make mistakes when you\u2019re counting the pieces, because the pieces line up nicely.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if there\u2019s a deeper reason\u2026 maybe it\u2019s also to make sure the product you get is the right amount? But mostly I think it\u2019s just about keeping the visual clear."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a \u201cdraw\u2011smaller\u2011bar\u201d picture could be useful when you\u2019re figuring out how many pieces of pizza you\u2019ll have if each slice is cut into smaller bits. \n\nFor example, imagine you have a big rectangular pizza that\u2019s divided into 4 equal rows. If each row actually has 3 smaller strips (so you\u2019re \u201cdrawing a smaller bar\u201d inside each big row), you could draw the whole pizza as a long bar, then draw a shorter bar inside each row to represent the 3 pieces. Multiplying 4\u202frows\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202fpieces per row would give you the total number of little pizza pieces (12). \n\nThe picture helps you see that the total is just a bunch of the smaller bars added together, so you don\u2019t have to count each piece one\u2011by\u2011one.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s how the method works in a real\u2011world setting."

      "question": "Using the draw smaller bar method, illustrate 2 \u00d7 5 and describe the process.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the \u201cdraw smaller bar\u201d way for 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 would go something like this:\n\n1. First you draw a big rectangle (or bar) that\u2019s 5 units long.  I\u2019m picturing a horizontal bar that\u2019s divided into 5 equal squares, like this:\n\n```\n|\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0|\n```\n\n2. Then, because you\u2019re multiplying by 2, you\u2019re supposed to draw a *smaller* bar that\u2019s 2 units long.  I\u2019m not totally sure how the \u201csmaller\u201d part works, but I think you just draw another bar underneath the first one that\u2019s only 2 squares long:\n\n```\n|\u25a0\u25a0|\n```\n\n3. The idea, I guess, is that the small bar shows the \u201c2\u201d part of the multiplication, and the big bar shows the \u201c5\u201d.  You then somehow combine them to get the product.  Maybe you count the total number of little squares that appear in both bars (5\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f7) and then double that because you have two bars?  That would give 14, which I guess is the answer for 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5.\n\nSo, in short, you draw a long bar of length 5, draw a shorter bar of length 2 below it, and then you somehow add the pieces together to get the product (I think it\u2019s 14?).  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s exactly right\u2014maybe the smaller bar is supposed to be repeated twice instead of just added once, but that\u2019s the best I can do right now."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the \u201cdraw smaller bar\u201d thing isn\u2019t really that different from the other visual tricks.  Basically you just draw a shorter bar for each number and then line them up, kind of like you would when you\u2019re doing repeated addition.  So instead of making an array or a grid, you just make a tiny bar that represents the product and\u2026 well, it\u2019s basically the same idea as the area model, just drawn a bit smaller.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it."

(So I\u2019m supposed to find the product of 5 and 3.)\n\n**Step\u202f2 \u2013 Draw the first (big) bar**  \nI draw a long horizontal bar and I split it into **5 equal parts** because the first factor is 5.  \nEach little segment is supposed to represent one \u201cunit\u201d of the second factor.\n\n**Step\u202f3 \u2013 Make the smaller bar**  \nNow I\u2019m supposed to draw a *smaller* bar that shows the second factor (3).  \nI think I have to take **3 of the 5 little parts** and draw another bar that is only those 3 parts long.  \nSo I draw a second bar that is 3/5 the length of the first one.\n\n**Step\u202f4 \u2013 Count the little squares**  \nIn the \u201cdraw smaller bar\u201d method you usually count the little squares in the overlap of the two bars.  \nI\u2019ll put a little square in each of the 3 parts of the smaller bar, so I have 3 squares total.\n\n**Step\u202f5 \u2013 Multiply**  \nSince each little square represents one group of the first factor (5), I think I have to multiply the number of squares (3) by the length of each segment (which I said was 5).  \nSo I do 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 =\u202f15.\n\n**Answer**  \nTherefore, 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 =\u202f15.\n\n---\n\n*I\u2019m not totally sure if I did the \u201csmaller bar\u201d part right, but that\u2019s what I remember from class.*"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the \u201cdraw smaller bar\u201d method has a few benefits for younger kids, but I\u2019m not totally sure about all of them.\n\n- It **helps students see multiplication as repeated addition** by showing a big bar that\u2019s split into equal smaller parts. I guess that makes the idea of \u201cadding the same number over and over\u201d a bit more concrete.\n\n- It can **make the numbers look smaller**, so the kids don\u2019t feel overwhelmed by big multiplication facts. Like, instead of thinking \u201c6\u202f\u00d7\u202f8 is 48,\u201d they see a bar that\u2019s broken into eight little pieces of six, which feels less scary.\n\n- The visual layout **lets students compare different products** side\u2011by\u2011side. If you draw a bar for 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 and another for 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f3, they can see the same total even though the order changes.\n\n- I think it also **supports classroom discussion** because the teacher can ask \u201cHow many little bars are there?\u201d and kids can count them together, which builds talking skills as well as math.\n\n- And maybe it **helps with memory**, since the picture sticks in their head more than a number sentence would.\n\nI\u2019m not completely confident about all of those, but those are the reasons I\u2019ve heard about for using the smaller\u2011bar drawing trick."
