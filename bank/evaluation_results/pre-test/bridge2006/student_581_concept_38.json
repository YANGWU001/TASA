      "question": "Describe how you would divide a circle into 5 equal sections.",
      "student_answer": "To split a circle into five equal parts you need each slice to cover the same central angle.  \nSince a full circle is\u202f360\u00b0, each of the five sections must be:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{360^\\circ}{5}=72^\\circ .\n\\]\n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step procedure**\n\n1. **Draw the circle** (or start with a pre\u2011drawn one) and mark its centre\u202f\\(O\\).\n\n2. **Draw a reference radius** \u2013 any line from the centre to the circumference. Call the point where it meets the circle \\(A\\).\n\n3. **Set a protractor at the centre**:  \n   - Place the centre mark of the protractor on \\(O\\) and align the zero line with \\(OA\\).\n\n4. **Mark the first angle**:  \n   - From the zero line, count 72\u00b0 clockwise (or counter\u2011clockwise) and make a small tick on the circumference. Call that point \\(B\\). Draw the radius \\(OB\\).\n\n5. **Repeat the 72\u00b0 measurement**:  \n   - Keeping the protractor on the centre, align its zero line with the newly drawn radius \\(OB\\).  \n   - Again count 72\u00b0 and place a tick \u2013 point \\(C\\). Draw radius \\(OC\\).\n\n6. **Continue until you have five radii**:  \n   - After the fourth tick you will reach point \\(E\\). The fifth tick will bring you back to the original point \\(A\\) (because 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f72\u00b0\u202f=\u202f360\u00b0).\n\n7. **Result**: The radii \\(OA, OB, OC, OD, OE\\) now divide the circle into five equal sectors, each with a central angle of 72\u00b0.\n\n**Alternative (compass\u2011only) method**  \nIf a protractor isn\u2019t available, you can use a compass and a straightedge:\n\n1. Draw a regular pentagon inside the circle (all five vertices lie on the circumference).  \n2. Connect the centre to each vertex of the pentagon \u2013 those lines are the required radii.  \nA regular pentagon can be constructed by first drawing a horizontal diameter, then constructing a 36\u00b0 angle (half of 72\u00b0) using classic compass\u2011and\u2011straightedge techniques, and stepping that angle around the circle.\n\nEither way, the circle is now divided into five equal sections."
