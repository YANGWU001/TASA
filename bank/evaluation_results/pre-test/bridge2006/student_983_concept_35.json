      "student_answer": "The square is divided into 9 equal parts by drawing two equally\u2011spaced horizontal lines and two equally\u2011spaced vertical lines. Each of the nine resulting sections is itself a **square**."

      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into 16 equal smaller squares, the arrangement is a \\(4 \\times 4\\) grid.  \n**Thus there are 4 rows and 4 columns of smaller squares.**"

      "student_answer": "The square is split into 25 small equal squares, which is \\(5 \\times 5\\).  \nTherefore, each row contains **5 parts**."

      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into more equal sections, each individual part becomes **smaller**.  \n\nThe total area of the square stays the same, so as the number of equal pieces increases the area (and thus the size) of each piece is the total area divided by a larger number. In other words,\u202f\u202f\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of one piece} = \\frac{\\text{total area of the square}}{\\text{number of equal parts}},\n\\]\n\nso increasing the denominator makes the result smaller. Consequently, each part\u2019s dimensions (side length, area, etc.) decrease as you create more equal sections."

      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Yes \u2013 a square can be divided into equal (congruent) triangles.**  \n\nThe reason is simple: a square is a quadrilateral, and any quadrilateral can be split into two triangles by drawing a single diagonal. In the case of a square the two resulting triangles are *right\u2011isosceles* and are exactly the same in shape and size.\n\n---\n\n### How it works\n\n1. **Two\u2011triangle division**  \n   Draw a line from one corner of the square to the opposite corner (a diagonal).  \n   - Each triangle has legs equal to the side length of the square, and a hypotenuse equal to the diagonal.  \n   - Because the square\u2019s sides are equal, the two triangles are congruent.\n\n2. **Four\u2011triangle division**  \n   Draw **both** diagonals; they intersect at the centre of the square.  \n   - The square is now split into four right\u2011isosceles triangles, all identical.\n\n3. **More triangles**  \n   By first subdividing the square into a grid of smaller congruent squares (e.g., a 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 or 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 array) and then drawing the diagonal in each small square, you obtain many congruent triangles of the same shape and area.  \n\n---\n\n### Why it is possible\n\n- **Area halving:** A diagonal cuts the square\u2019s area exactly in half, so each triangle occupies half the area.  \n- **Equal side lengths:** Because all four sides of the square are equal, the two triangles share the same side lengths (two sides of the square and the diagonal), guaranteeing congruence.  \n- **Geometric principle:** Any convex quadrilateral can be partitioned into two congruent triangles by a diagonal; a square is a special case of a convex quadrilateral.\n\n---\n\n### In short\n\nA square can certainly be divided into equal triangles\u2014most straightforwardly by drawing one diagonal (giving two equal right\u2011isosceles triangles) or both diagonals (giving four). The symmetry and equal side lengths of the square make such partitions natural and mathematically valid."

      "student_answer": "The square is divided into \\(36\\) equal smaller squares, which means it is arranged in a \\(6 \\times 6\\) grid (since \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\)).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of small squares along each side} = 6\n\\]\n\nThe side length of each small square is therefore the original side length divided by 6:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Side length of each small square} = \\frac{12}{6} = 2\n\\]\n\n**Answer:\u202f2** (units)."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is cut into several **congruent rectangles**, each piece must have the same length\u202f\\(L\\) and width\u202f\\(W\\).  \nFor a rectangle to be a square we would need  \n\n\\[\nL = W .\n\\]\n\nIf the original figure is a square of side\u2011length \\(S\\), its total area is \\(S^{2}\\).  \nIf the square is divided into \\(n\\) equal rectangles, the area of each rectangle is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{S^{2}}{n}=L\\cdot W .\n\\]\n\nTo cover the whole square with copies of the same rectangle, the side\u2011length \\(S\\) must be an integer multiple of both \\(L\\) and \\(W\\). In other words, there must exist positive integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that  \n\n\\[\nS = aL = bW \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad n = a\\cdot b .\n\\]\n\nOnly when \\(a = b\\) (so that the number of pieces \\(n = a^{2}\\) is a perfect square) do we get \\(L = W\\); in that special case each piece **is** a smaller square.  \n\nFor any other value of \\(n\\) (e.g., \\(n = 2,3,4,5,6,\\dots\\) that is not a perfect square), the integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be different, which forces \\(L\\neq W\\). Consequently the pieces are rectangles whose sides are unequal, i.e., they are **not** squares.\n\n**In short:**  \nDividing a square into equal rectangles forces each piece to have the same two side lengths. Unless the number of pieces is a perfect square (so the tiling can be arranged in a square grid), those side lengths cannot be equal, and thus the pieces cannot be squares."
