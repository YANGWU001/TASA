      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of 5 and 20 is actually 5, because 5 is the smallest number that both numbers can go into\u2026 well, 5 obviously goes into itself, and 20 is just 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f4, so 5 works as a common multiple. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from the examples."

      "question": "If two numbers are 8 and 24, determine their LCM and explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of\u202f8\u202fand\u202f24 is **32**.  \n\nMy reasoning (though I\u2019m not totally sure) is that 8 goes into 32\u202ffour\u202ftimes (8\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f32) and 24 goes into 32\u202fonce with a remainder, so I thought I needed a number that\u2019s a bit bigger than both. I guess the next multiple of 8 after 24 is 32, so that must be the least common multiple.  \n\n(\u2026but I\u2019m not really confident about this.)"

      "question": "True or False: If one number is a multiple of another, their LCM is always the larger number. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think it\u2019s **false**.  \nIf one number is a multiple of the other, I guess the LCM could be something bigger than the larger number, like maybe the product of the two numbers. For example, if we have 4 and 8 (8 is a multiple of 4), I feel the LCM might be 12 or something else, not just 8. So I\u2019d say the statement is false because the LCM isn\u2019t always the larger number."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Identify the LCM of 12 and 36 and explain the steps you used to find it.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of 12 and 36 might be 48.\n\nHere\u2019s how I tried to get it:\n\n1. I listed a few multiples of 12:\u202f12,\u202f24,\u202f36,\u202f48,\u202f60\u2026  \n2. Then I listed some multiples of 36:\u202f36,\u202f72,\u202f108\u2026  \n3. I looked for the first number that shows up in both lists. I saw 36 in the 12\u2011list and 36 in the 36\u2011list, but I got confused because 36 is actually the smaller number, so I kept going a bit further.  \n4. After that I thought maybe I needed a number that\u2019s bigger than both, so I kept moving down the 12\u2011list until I hit 48, and I assumed that must be the common multiple that works for both.  \n\nSo I guessed 48 as the least common multiple. Sorry if that\u2019s not right!"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the student\u2019s claim is actually right. Since 7 goes into both numbers\u20147\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f1 and 21\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f3\u20147 is a common multiple of 7 and 21. And because it\u2019s the smaller one, it must be the least common multiple. So the LCM of 7 and 21 is 7, not a larger number. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it looks like.)"
