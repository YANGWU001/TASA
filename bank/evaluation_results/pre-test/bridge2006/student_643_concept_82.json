      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 2/3 is the larger fraction.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but when I try to compare them I get confused.  If I think of them as parts of a pizza, 3/4 means three out of four slices, and 2/3 means two out of three slices.  Two out of three feels like a bigger \u201cpiece\u201d because the denominator (3) is smaller, so each slice is bigger.  So I guess 2/3 is bigger than 3/4.  \n\n(I'm not confident about this, but that's what I get.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think John ate more cake.  \n\nI tried to compare the fractions by turning them into decimals.  \nI guessed that 2/5 is about 0.25 (I think I mixed it up with 1/4) and that 3/8 is about 0.35, so 3/8 looks bigger.  \n\nSo, according to my calculation, John ate more cake than Sarah."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the bigger one might be **3/5**.  \n\nMy reasoning\u2026 well, if I try to make the denominators the same, 3/5 is like 6/10, right? And 7/10 is\u2026 uh, 7 over 10. So actually\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing them up. I guess 3/5 is a little bit bigger than 7/10 because the numerator (3) seems \u201ccloser\u201d to the denominator (5) than 7 is to 10.  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say **3/5 is greater**\u2014I\u2019m not totally sure, though."

Even though the second one has more little pieces, each piece in the 2\u20443 jar looks a little bigger, so the total shaded area seems bigger.  \n\nAlso, when I try to compare the fractions as decimals (even if I\u2019m maybe mixing them up), I get something like 2\u20443 \u2248\u202f0.75 and 3\u20444 \u2248\u202f0.66, so 0.75 is larger than 0.66. That would mean the 2\u20443 jar holds more water.  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say the jar with\u202f2\u20443\u202ffull is the one with more water."

If I try to compare them by converting to decimals, 5\u204412 is about 0.42 and 4\u20449 is about 0.44, so 0.42 looks bigger than 0.44 in my head.  \n\nSo I\u2019d say it\u2019s more, because 5 out of 12 pieces seems to be a larger fraction than 4\u20449.
