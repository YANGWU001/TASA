      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a horizontal bar is divided into 8 equal parts, how many divisions does it have?",
      "student_answer": "The bar has **8 divisions**."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "A horizontal bar is divided into 5 equal sections. What fraction of the bar does one section represent?",
      "student_answer": "One section represents\u202f\\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{5}\\)\u202fof the horizontal bar."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What is the total number of equal divisions in a horizontal bar divided into thirds?",
      "student_answer": "The bar is split into three equal parts, so there are **3 equal divisions**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If a horizontal bar is divided into 10 equal parts, how much of the bar does each section represent as a fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the 10 equal sections represents one\u2011tenth of the whole bar, which is written as the fraction  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{10}}\n\\]"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A horizontal bar is divided into equal sections of 1/6 each. How many divisions does the bar have?",
      "student_answer": "The bar is split into pieces each representing \\(\\frac16\\) of the whole.  \nSince \\(\\displaystyle 6 \\times \\frac16 = 1\\), there are **6 equal divisions** in the bar."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If a horizontal bar is divided into 12 equal parts, how many parts are there in total?",
      "student_answer": "There would be **12 parts** in total. Each division creates one equal segment, so a bar split into 12 equal parts yields 12 segments."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the number of divisions when a horizontal bar is split into equal parts of 1/4?",
      "student_answer": "The bar is divided into **4 equal parts**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A horizontal bar is divided into 3 equal sections. What fraction of the bar does each section represent?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the three equal sections represents one\u2011third of the whole bar.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Fraction per section} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]"
