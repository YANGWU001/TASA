      "question": "Describe how you would divide a circle into 5 equal sections.",
      "student_answer": "To divide a circle into **five equal sections** you need to create five central angles that are each the same size. Since a full circle measures 360\u00b0, each of the five angles must be  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{360^\\circ}{5}=72^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nHere\u2019s a step\u2011by\u2011step way to do it (you can use a protractor, a ruler, or a drafting compass):\n\n1. **Draw the circle and its center**  \n   - Sketch the circle and clearly mark its centre point\u202f\\(O\\).\n\n2. **Set up a reference radius**  \n   - Draw any radius from the centre to the outer edge; call the point where it meets the circle **A**.  \n   - This radius will serve as the starting line for measuring the 72\u00b0 increments.\n\n3. **Measure the first 72\u00b0**  \n   - Place the protractor\u2019s centre hole on\u202f\\(O\\) and align the zero\u2011degree line with radius\u202f\\(OA\\).  \n   - Mark a point **B** on the circumference at the 72\u00b0 mark.\n\n4. **Draw the second radius**  \n   - Connect\u202f\\(O\\) to\u202f\\(B\\) with a straight line. This is the second dividing line.\n\n5. **Repeat the measurement**  \n   - Keeping the protractor positioned at\u202f\\(O\\), now align the zero line with the newly drawn radius\u202f\\(OB\\).  \n   - Mark the next point **C** at 72\u00b0 from\u202f\\(OB\\) (which will be 144\u00b0 from the original radius).  \n   - Join\u202f\\(O\\) to\u202f\\(C\\).\n\n6. **Continue until you have five radii**  \n   - Continue the same process: from\u202f\\(OC\\) mark 72\u00b0 to get point **D**, join\u202f\\(O\\)\u2013\\(D\\);  \n   - From\u202f\\(OD\\) mark 72\u00b0 to get point **E**, join\u202f\\(O\\)\u2013\\(E\\);  \n   - The final 72\u00b0 from\u202f\\(OE\\) will bring you back to the original point\u202f\\(A\\), completing the circle.\n\n7. **Check your work**  \n   - Each sector should now be a 72\u00b0 \u201cpizza slice\u201d.  \n   - You can verify by measuring any one of the central angles again with the protractor; they should all read 72\u00b0.\n\n**Alternative (compass\u2011only) method**  \nIf you don\u2019t have a protractor, you can use the \u201c5\u2011point star\u201d trick:\n\n1. Draw a regular pentagon inside the circle (each interior angle is 108\u00b0).  \n2. Connect each vertex of the pentagon to the centre\u202f\\(O\\).  \n3. Those five lines automatically divide the circle into five equal 72\u00b0 sectors because a regular pentagon\u2019s central angles are 72\u00b0.\n\nEither method will give you five congruent circular sectors, each representing one\u2011fifth of the whole circle."

      "student_answer": "**How to divide a circle into equal sections**\n\n1. **Understand the relationship between a full circle and its central angles**  \n   A complete circle measures **360\u00b0** (or \\(2\\pi\\) radians).  \n   When the circle is split into *n* equal parts, each part is bounded by two radii that meet at the centre, forming a *central angle*.\n\n2. **Calculate the size of each central angle**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Central angle} = \\frac{360^\\circ}{n}\n   \\quad\\text{(or } \\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\text{ radians)}\n   \\]  \n   This formula guarantees that the *n* angles add up to the full 360\u00b0.\n\n3. **Draw the divisions**  \n   * Start with a clear \u201creference\u201d radius (often drawn horizontally to the right).  \n   * Using a protractor (for degrees) or a compass with a degree\u2011marked circle, measure the central angle from the reference line, draw a new radius, and repeat.  \n   * Continue until you have drawn *n* radii; the arcs between successive radii are the equal sections.\n\n4. **Check your work**  \n   * Count the drawn sections \u2013 there should be *n*.  \n   * Verify that the sum of the measured angles equals 360\u00b0 (or \\(2\\pi\\) radians).  \n\n---\n\n### Example: 9 equal divisions\n\n1. **Number of sections**: \\(n = 9\\).\n\n2. **Compute the central angle**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Angle per section} = \\frac{360^\\circ}{9}\n   = 40^\\circ\n   \\]\n   (In radians, \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{9} \\approx 0.698 \\text{ rad}\\).)\n\n3. **Draw the 9 radii**  \n   Starting from the reference radius, mark successive 40\u00b0 increments (0\u00b0, 40\u00b0, 80\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 160\u00b0, 200\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 280\u00b0, 320\u00b0). Connect each point to the centre; the sectors between them are the nine equal parts.\n\n4. **Verification**  \n   \\(9 \\times 40^\\circ = 360^\\circ\\), confirming that the circle is completely covered with no gaps or overlaps.\n\n**Result:** Each of the 9 equal sections of the circle subtends a central angle of **40 degrees** (or \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{9} \\) radians)."
