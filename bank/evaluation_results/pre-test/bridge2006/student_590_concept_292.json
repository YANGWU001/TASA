  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the concept of subtracting negative integers, particularly in their explanation (Question 3) and the response to Question 7. However, there are significant misunderstandings in most of the other answers, particularly in the application of the rules for rewriting subtraction of negative integers. The student should focus on clearly understanding that subtracting a negative integer is equivalent to adding its positive counterpart.",

      "question": "Explain why subtracting a negative integer is equivalent to adding a positive integer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I kind of get why it works, but I\u2019m not totally sure.  \n\nWhen you have something like\u202f\\(5 - (-3)\\), you\u2019re taking away a negative number. I guess that\u2019s like\u2026 taking away a debt, which means you actually get more? So the minus sign kinda \u201cflips\u201d the negative into a positive, and you end up adding it: \\(5 - (-3) = 5 + 3\\).  \n\nI guess the reason is that the two minus signs kind of cancel each other out, so you\u2019re left with a plus. So subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive because the negatives cancel and you just end up with a plus sign in front of the number.  \n\n\u2026or maybe it\u2019s because you\u2019re actually adding the opposite of the negative, which is a positive. That\u2019s why you get the same result as adding the positive version of the number.  \n\nHope that makes sense\u2026?"

But I\u2019m not totally sure\u2026 maybe it becomes \\(-3 + (-5)\\)? If that's the case, then \\(-3 + (-5) = -8\\). So I guess the result is \\(-8\\). \n\n(I'm not really confident about this.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011world way to see subtracting a negative as addition might be with temperatures.  \n\nSay the temperature is **\u20113\u202f\u00b0C** (so it\u2019s three degrees below zero) and you \u201csubtract\u202f\u20112\u202f\u00b0C\u201d.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you\u2019d end up at **\u20115\u202f\u00b0C** \u2013 it\u2019s like you added the \u20132\u202f\u00b0C to the original \u20133\u202f\u00b0C.  \n\nSo the idea is that subtracting a negative temperature (\u20112\u202f\u00b0C) makes the temperature get even colder, just as if you added that negative amount."
