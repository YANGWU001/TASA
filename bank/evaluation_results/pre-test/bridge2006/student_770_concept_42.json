      "question": "A horizontal bar is divided into 5 equal sections. What fraction of the bar does one section represent?",
      "student_answer": "One section corresponds to \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{5}\\) of the horizontal bar."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What is the total number of equal divisions in a horizontal bar divided into thirds?",
      "student_answer": "The bar is split into three equal parts, so there are **3 equal divisions**."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If a horizontal bar is divided into 10 equal parts, how much of the bar does each section represent as a fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the 10 equal sections represents one\u2011tenth of the whole bar, i.e.  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{10}\n\\]"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A horizontal bar is divided into equal sections of 1/6 each. How many divisions does the bar have?",
      "student_answer": "The bar is split into pieces that are each \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) of the whole length.  \nTo find how many such pieces fit into the whole bar, divide the whole (1) by the size of one piece:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{6}} = 1 \\times \\frac{6}{1} = 6.\n\\]\n\nSo the horizontal bar has **6 equal divisions**."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A horizontal bar is divided into 3 equal sections. What fraction of the bar does each section represent?",
