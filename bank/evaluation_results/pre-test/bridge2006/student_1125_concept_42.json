  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of equal divisions in horizontal bars, accurately identifying the number of divisions in most cases. However, the response to Question 3, while correct in its fraction representation, does not answer the question about the number of divisions, resulting in a score of 0 for that answer. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the topic.",

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "A horizontal bar is divided into 5 equal sections. What fraction of the bar does one section represent?",
      "student_answer": "One section represents \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{5}\\) of the horizontal bar."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What is the total number of equal divisions in a horizontal bar divided into thirds?",
      "student_answer": "The bar is split into three equal parts, so there are **3** divisions."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If a horizontal bar is divided into 10 equal parts, how much of the bar does each section represent as a fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the\u202f10 equal sections represents \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{10}\\) of the whole bar."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A horizontal bar is divided into equal sections of 1/6 each. How many divisions does the bar have?",
      "student_answer": "The bar is split into pieces each equal to \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) of the whole.  \nNumber of pieces\u202f=\u202f\\( \\dfrac{1}{\\frac{1}{6}} = 6\\).\n\n**Answer: 6 divisions**."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the number of divisions when a horizontal bar is split into equal parts of 1/4?",
