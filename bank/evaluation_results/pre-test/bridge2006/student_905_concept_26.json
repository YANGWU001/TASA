However, there was a mistake in the prime factorization for Question 3, where the GCF was incorrectly calculated as 12 instead of 12. Overall, the student shows good comprehension and application of the GCF concept.",

      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) of two or more integers is the largest positive integer that divides each of those numbers exactly (i.e., with no remainder). In other words, it is the biggest number that is a factor of every integer in the set.  \n\nFor example, the GCF of\u202f12\u202fand\u202f18 is\u202f6, because the common factors of 12 and 18 are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202fand\u202f6, and 6 is the greatest among them. The GCF is useful for simplifying fractions, factoring expressions, and solving problems that involve dividing quantities into equal parts."
