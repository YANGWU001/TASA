      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) of two or more integers is the largest positive integer that divides each of the numbers exactly (i.e., without leaving a remainder). In other words, it is the biggest number that is a factor of every number in the given set. The GCF is useful for simplifying fractions, reducing ratios, and solving problems that involve grouping or partitioning objects into equal-sized sets."

      "student_answer": "If the greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers is\u202f1, it means the numbers are **relatively prime** (or **coprime**). In other words, they share no common divisor larger than\u202f1; their only common factor is\u202f1. This implies that any fraction formed with one of the numbers as the numerator and the other as the denominator is already in lowest terms, and the two numbers have no prime factor in common."
