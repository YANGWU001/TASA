      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (often called the GCF or\u202fgcd) of two or more integers is the **largest positive integer that divides each of the numbers exactly**\u2014that is, with no remainder.  \n\nIn other words, if you list all the factors (divisors) of each number, the GCF is the biggest number that appears in every list. It tells you the biggest \u201cbuilding\u2011block\u201d size you can use to break each of the given numbers down without leaving any leftovers.  \n\nFor example, the factors of\u202f12 are\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f12 and the factors of\u202f18 are\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f18. The common factors are\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f6, and the greatest of these is\u202f6, so\u202fgcf(12,\u202f18)\u202f=\u202f6.  \n\nThe GCF is useful for simplifying fractions, reducing ratios, and solving problems that involve sharing or grouping objects into equal parts."
