      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "If a square is divided into 4 equal parts, how many smaller squares are formed?",
      "student_answer": "The square is split into four equal parts, so it forms **4 smaller squares**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "A square is divided into 9 equal sections. What shape are the sections?",
      "student_answer": "The square is divided into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, so each of the nine equal sections is itself a **square**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into 16 equal smaller squares, the division forms a 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 grid.  \nSo there are **4 rows** and **4 columns** of the smaller squares."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "A square is divided into 25 equal parts. How many parts are in each row?",
      "student_answer": "The square would be arranged as a \\(5 \\times 5\\) grid, so there are **5 parts in each row**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is split into more equal sections, each individual part becomes **smaller** \u2013 the total area stays the same, so dividing it into a greater number of pieces reduces the size (area) of each piece."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "If a square is divided horizontally and vertically into 4 equal sections, what is the shape of each section?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the four sections is itself a smaller square."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013 a square can be broken up into congruent (equal\u2011sized) triangles.  \nThe simplest way is to draw one of the two diagonals; the diagonal cuts the square into **two** right\u2011isosceles triangles that are exactly the same size and shape.  \n\nIf you draw **both** diagonals you get **four** right\u2011isosceles triangles, all equal to one another.  \n\nBecause a triangle\u2019s interior angles add up to 180\u00b0, the two angles that meet at the centre of the square after the diagonals are drawn each become 90\u00b0, so the four pieces fit together perfectly without gaps or overlaps.  \n\nIn fact you can keep subdividing those triangles (for example, by joining the mid\u2011points of their sides) to produce many more small, identical triangles that still fill the whole square.  \n\nSo a square is not limited to being divided only into smaller squares; it can also be tiled by any even number of equal triangles (2,\u202f4,\u202f8,\u202f16\u202f\u2026 etc.). The reason is simply that straight lines (like the diagonals) can partition the square\u2019s area into triangular regions that match each other exactly."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "The original square is\u202f12\u202funits on a side.  \nSince 36 equal squares fit into it, they form a 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f6 grid (\u221a36\u202f=\u202f6).  \nSo each smaller square\u2019s side length is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{6}=2\\text{ units}.\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** 2 units."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is cut up into several identical pieces, each piece must have the same shape and the same dimensions as every other piece.  \n\nA square\u2019s sides are equal, so its side\u2011to\u2011side ratio (its \u201caspect ratio\u201d) is\u202f1\u202f:\u202f1.  \nA rectangle, on the other hand, has an aspect ratio that can be any pair of numbers; it is only a square when that ratio also happens to be\u202f1\u202f:\u202f1.\n\nIf we split a square into several equal rectangles, we inevitably change the aspect ratio of each piece. For example, if we cut the square into two equal parts by a vertical (or horizontal) line, each part has the dimensions  \n\n\\[\n\\text{width} = \\frac{\\text{side of the original square}}{2},\\qquad\n\\text{height} = \\text{side of the original square},\n\\]\n\nso the width\u2011to\u2011height ratio becomes\u202f\u00bd\u202f:\u202f1 (or 1\u202f:\u202f\u00bd). That ratio is not 1\u202f:\u202f1, so the pieces are rectangles, not squares.  \n\nThe same reasoning holds for any other number of equal divisions: unless the division line(s) happen to preserve a 1\u202f:\u202f1 ratio (which would just give you smaller squares again), the resulting pieces will have one side that is a fraction of the original side length while the other side stays the full length, producing a non\u2011square rectangle.\n\nIn short, dividing a square into equal rectangles changes the side\u2011length proportion of each piece, and because a square requires equal side lengths, the resulting pieces cannot be squares."

      "question": "Draw a square divided into 9 equal sections and label the dimensions of each smaller square if the original square has a side length of 3 units.",
      "student_answer": "Here is a description of the required drawing and the dimensions:\n\n1. **Big square** \u2013 draw a square whose each side measures **3\u202funits**.\n\n2. **Divide the big square** \u2013 draw two equally\u2011spaced horizontal lines and two equally\u2011spaced vertical lines inside the big square.  \n   *These four lines create a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, giving you 9 smaller squares of equal size.*\n\n3. **Label the dimensions of each smaller square** \u2013 because the big square is 3\u202funits on a side and it is split into three equal parts along each side, each small square has a side length of  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{3\\text{ units}}{3}=1\\text{ unit}.\n\\]\n\nSo label each of the nine little squares with \u201c1\u202funit\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202funit\u201d (or simply \u201c1\u202funit\u201d for the side length).  \n\nIf you want to show the area, you can note that each little square has an area of  \n\n\\[\n1\\text{ unit} \\times 1\\text{ unit}=1\\text{ square unit}.\n\\]\n\nThe final picture therefore looks like a 3\u2011unit\u2011by\u20113\u2011unit square divided into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, with every small square labeled **1\u202funit** on each side."
