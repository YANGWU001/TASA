      "student_answer": "Percentages are a handy way to talk about a part of a whole without having to know the exact size of that whole.  \nIn everyday life we constantly use percentages to figure out how big a piece is, how much we owe, or how much we\u2019ll receive. The basic steps are:\n\n1. **Turn the percent into a decimal** \u2013 divide the percent by\u202f100.  \n   Example:\u202f25\u202f%\u202f\u2192\u202f0.25,\u202f8\u202f%\u202f\u2192\u202f0.08,\u202f150\u202f%\u202f\u2192\u202f1.50.  \n\n2. **Multiply the decimal by the total amount (the \u201cwhole\u201d)** to get the part.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Part} = \\text{Whole} \\times \\frac{\\text{Percent}}{100}\n   \\]\n\n### Real\u2011world examples\n\n| Situation | How the percent is used |\n|-----------|--------------------------|\n| **Discounts** \u2013 a shirt is \\$40 and the store offers 20\u202f% off.  Convert 20\u202f% to 0.20 and multiply: 0.20\u202f\u00d7\u202f40\u202f=\u202f\\$8 off, so you pay \\$32. |\n| **Sales tax** \u2013 a meal costs \\$25 and the tax rate is 8\u202f%. 0.08\u202f\u00d7\u202f25\u202f=\u202f\\$2.00 tax, total = \\$27. |\n| **Interest** \u2013 a savings account earns 3\u202f% per year on a balance of \\$1,200. 0.03\u202f\u00d7\u202f1,200\u202f=\u202f\\$36 interest earned for the year. |\n| **Commission** \u2013 a real\u2011estate agent gets 6\u202f% of a \\$300,000 sale. 0.06\u202f\u00d7\u202f300,000\u202f=\u202f\\$18,000 commission. |\n| **Proportional recipes** \u2013 a cake recipe calls for 25\u202f% of the flour to be sugar. If you use 2\u202fkg of flour, sugar needed = 0.25\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fkg\u202f=\u202f0.5\u202fkg. |\n\n### Working backward (finding the whole)\n\nSometimes you know the part and the percent and need the original whole. The usual formula is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Whole} = \\frac{\\text{Part}}{\\text{Percent as a decimal}}.\n\\]\n\n*Example (with a common slip):*  \nIf a tip of \\$15 represents a 20\u202f% tip, the bill is  \n\\[\n\\text{Bill} = \\frac{15}{20} = 0.75\\,\\text{(incorrect)}.\n\\]  \nThe correct step is to divide by 0.20, not by 20:  \n\\[\n\\text{Bill} = \\frac{15}{0.20} = 75.\n\\]  \n\n### Why percentages are useful\n\n- **Standardisation:** Everyone understands \u201cpercent\u201d as \u201cout of 100\u201d, so numbers are comparable across contexts.  \n- **Scalability:** If the whole changes (e.g., a bigger purchase), you can instantly recompute the part by re\u2011applying the same percent.  \n- **Communication:** Saying \u201cthe loan interest is 5\u202f% per year\u201d instantly tells the listener the cost relative to the principal, without needing the exact dollar amount.  \n\nIn short, percentages let us translate a proportion into a concrete amount by converting the percent to a decimal and multiplying (or dividing) by the known total. This simple arithmetic shows up in shopping, finance, cooking, and basically any situation where a part\u2011to\u2011whole relationship matters."

      "question": "Describe the difference between calculating a part using percentages versus using fractions.",
      "student_answer": "**Percentages**\n\n- A percentage always means \u201cparts out of 100.\u201d  \n- To find a part of a whole you first change the percentage to a decimal (divide by\u202f100) and then multiply by the total amount.  \n\n\u202fExample:\u202f30\u202f% of\u202f50 =\u202f0.30\u202f\u00d7\u202f50 =\u202f15.\n\n**Fractions**\n\n- A fraction expresses the part directly as a ratio of two integers (numerator\u202f/\u202fdenominator).  \n- To find a part of a whole you multiply the total by the fraction.  \n\n\u202fExample:\u202f3\u204410 of\u202f50 =\u202f(3/10)\u202f\u00d7\u202f50 =\u202f15.\n\n**Key difference**\n\n- With percentages you always work with \u201cout\u2011of\u2011100\u201d first and then convert to a decimal; with fractions you work with the exact ratio right away.  \n- Converting a percentage to a fraction is simply \u201cpercent\u202f/\u202f100\u201d and then reduce if possible.  \n\n\u202fExample conversions:  \n\n\u200320\u202f% \u2192\u202f20\u2044100\u202f=\u202f1\u20445 (simplified)  \n\n\u200340\u202f% \u2192\u202f40\u2044100\u202f=\u202f2\u20445  \n\n\u2003(incorrectly, some students might think 20\u202f% =\u202f20\u2044100\u202f=\u202f1\u20443, which is not right.)\n\n**When to use which**\n\n- Percentages are handy when the problem already gives a \u201cper\u2011hundred\u201d value or when you need an easy mental estimate.  \n- Fractions are useful when the relationship is naturally expressed as a ratio (\u00bd,\u202f\u2153,\u202f\u00be, etc.) or when you want an exact rational result without rounding.\n\nIn short, percentages are a special case of fractions (percent\u202f=\u202f/100), and the calculation method differs only in whether you first convert to a decimal (percentage) or keep the ratio as a fraction."
