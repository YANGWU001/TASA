      "question": "Explain why the LCM of two numbers is sometimes equal to their product.",
      "student_answer": "The LCM (least\u2011common multiple) is the smallest positive number that both original numbers divide into.  \nWhen the two numbers don\u2019t share any prime factors \u2013 in other words, when their greatest common divisor is\u202f1 (they are *relatively prime*) \u2013 the \u201csmallest\u201d common multiple actually has to be the product of the two numbers.  \n\n**Why?**  \nIf there are no common prime factors, the only way to combine the prime\u2011factor lists of the two numbers is to multiply them together. Any smaller number would be missing at least one of the required prime factors, so it couldn\u2019t be divisible by both numbers. Therefore the LCM =\u202fproduct.\n\n*Examples*  \n-\u202f4\u202fand\u202f9 have no common factors (gcd\u202f=\u202f1). Their LCM is 36, which is 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f9.  \n-\u202f7\u202fand\u202f12 are also relatively prime, so LCM\u202f=\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f84.\n\nI think there are a couple of other special cases, too. If one of the numbers is\u202f1, the LCM is just the other number, and that also equals the product (1\u202f\u00d7\u202fthe other number). I also heard that when the two numbers are the same, the LCM equals their product, but I\u2019m not completely sure about that part \u2013 it might only be true for the number\u202f1.  \n\nSo, in short, the LCM equals the product whenever the numbers share no common factors (gcd\u202f=\u202f1), and a few trivial cases like involving\u202f1."

      "student_answer": "The least common multiple of 4 and\u202f6 is **12** (since 12 is the smallest number that both 4 and 6 divide into evenly).  \n\nThe product of the two numbers is \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\).  \n\nSo, the LCM is **not** equal to their product."

      "student_answer": "I think they could be\u202f3\u202fand\u202f12.  \n\nThe least common multiple of\u202f3\u202fand\u202f12\u202fis 12, and their product is  \n\n\\[\n3 \\times 12 = 36,\n\\]\n\nwhich matches the given product. (In fact, the relationship\u202f\\(a\\cdot b = \\text{LCM}(a,b)\\times\\text{GCD}(a,b)\\) gives a GCD of\u202f\\(36/12 = 3\\), which is indeed the GCD of\u202f3\u202fand\u202f12.)  \n\nSo the pair\u202f3\u202fand\u202f12\u202fsatisfies both conditions."

      "student_answer": "I think the least common multiple of\u202f9\u202fand\u202f15 is\u202f45.  \n\n- The prime factorisations are\u20039\u202f=\u202f3\u00b2\u2003and\u200315\u202f=\u202f3\u00b75.  \n- Taking the highest power of each prime that appears gives\u20033\u00b2\u202f\u00b7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f45.  \n\nThe product of the two numbers is\u202f9\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f135, which is larger than the LCM.

      "student_answer": "I think one simple example is the numbers **4 and\u202f9**.\n\n- The product of the two numbers is \\(4 \\times 9 = 36\\).\n- To find the LCM we look for the smallest positive integer that both 4 and 9 divide into.  \n  Since 4\u202f=\u202f\\(2^2\\) and 9\u202f=\u202f\\(3^2\\) share no common prime factors, the least common multiple is just the product of the highest powers of all primes that appear:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(4,9)=2^2 \\times 3^2 = 36.\n\\]\n\nBecause the two numbers have no common factors (their greatest common divisor is 1), the LCM ends up being exactly the same as the product. In other words, when two numbers are **relatively prime** (they share no prime factors), the LCM equals the product.  \n\n*(I\u2019m a bit unsure, but I think the fact that 4 and 9 are both prime numbers also helps\u2026 actually 4 isn\u2019t prime, but the key point is that they have no common factors.)*"

      "question": "Find two numbers where the LCM is less than their product. Explain how you determined this.",
      "student_answer": "One easy example is the pair **6 and 9**.\n\n- Their product is \\(6 \\times 9 = 54\\).\n- The greatest common divisor of 6 and 9 is \\( \\gcd(6,9)=3\\).\n- Using the relationship \\(\\text{LCM}(a,b)=\\dfrac{a \\times b}{\\gcd(a,b)}\\), we get  \n\n  \\[\n  \\text{LCM}(6,9)=\\frac{6 \\times 9}{3}=18.\n  \\]\n\nSince \\(18\\) is clearly **less than** the product \\(54\\), the LCM of 6 and 9 is smaller than their product.\n\n**Why this works:**  \nWhen two numbers share a common factor (i.e., their GCD is greater than 1), the LCM is the product divided by that GCD. Because we are dividing the product by a number larger than 1, the result (the LCM) must be smaller than the original product. Any non\u2011coprime pair, like 6 and 9, will therefore give an LCM that is less than the product."

      "student_answer": "The least\u2011common multiple of two numbers is the **smallest** positive integer that both numbers divide into, while the product is simply the two numbers multiplied together.  \n\n**Prime\u2011factor method**\n\n1. Write each number as a product of prime factors  \n\n\\[\n10 = 2 \\times 5 \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad 15 = 3 \\times 5\n\\]\n\n2. To get the LCM we take each prime factor **once**, using the highest power that appears in either factorisation.  \n   - The factor \\(2\\) appears only in 10 \u2192 keep \\(2\\).  \n   - The factor \\(3\\) appears only in 15 \u2192 keep \\(3\\).  \n   - The factor \\(5\\) appears in both, but only to the first power \u2192 keep \\(5\\).\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(10,15)=2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 30\n\\]\n\n3. The product of the two numbers is  \n\n\\[\n10 \\times 15 = 150\n\\]\n\n**Why they\u2019re not the same**\n\nBecause 10 and 15 share a common factor (the 5), the LCM does **not** need to include that factor twice. In the product the factor 5 is multiplied together twice (once from each number), giving a larger result (150). The LCM only includes each prime factor once at its highest exponent, so it is smaller (30).  \n\nThus, the LCM of 10 and 15 is **30**, not the product **150**, because the common factor 5 is counted only once in the LCM."
