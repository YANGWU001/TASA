      "question": "Explain why the LCM of two numbers is sometimes equal to their product.",
      "student_answer": "The least\u2011common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) can be expressed in terms of their greatest common divisor (GCD) by the well\u2011known formula  \n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)=\\frac{a\\cdot b}{\\gcd(a,b)} .\n\\]\n\nFrom this relationship it follows that the LCM will equal the product \\(a\\cdot b\\) exactly when the denominator \\(\\gcd(a,b)\\) is \\(1\\). In other words, **the LCM of two numbers is the same as their product whenever the numbers are relatively prime (coprime)**\u2014that is, they share no common prime factors.\n\n### Why this happens\n\n1. **Prime\u2011factor view**  \n   Write each number as a product of primes:  \n\n   \\[\n   a = p_1^{e_1}\\,p_2^{e_2}\\dots p_k^{e_k}, \\qquad \n   b = p_1^{f_1}\\,p_2^{f_2}\\dots p_k^{f_k},\n   \\]\n\n   where some exponents may be zero.  \n   - The GCD takes the **minimum** exponent for each prime: \\(\\gcd(a,b)=p_1^{\\min(e_1,f_1)}\\dots\\).  \n   - The LCM takes the **maximum** exponent: \\(\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)=p_1^{\\max(e_1,f_1)}\\dots\\).\n\n   If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) share *no* primes, then for every prime either \\(e_i=0\\) or \\(f_i=0\\). Consequently \\(\\min(e_i,f_i)=0\\) for all \\(i\\), making \\(\\gcd(a,b)=1\\). The LCM then simply collects all the prime factors from both numbers, which is exactly the product \\(a\\cdot b\\).\n\n2. **Algebraic view**  \n   Using the formula above, set \\(\\gcd(a,b)=1\\):\n\n   \\[\n   \\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)=\\frac{a\\cdot b}{1}=a\\cdot b.\n   \\]\n\n   Hence the equality holds precisely when the two numbers are coprime.\n\n### Examples\n\n- **Coprime pair:** \\(8\\) and \\(15\\).  \n  \\(\\gcd(8,15)=1\\).  \n  \\(\\operatorname{lcm}(8,15)=\\frac{8\\cdot15}{1}=120\\), which indeed equals \\(8\\times15\\).\n\n- **Non\u2011coprime pair:** \\(12\\) and \\(18\\).  \n  \\(\\gcd(12,18)=6\\).  \n  \\(\\operatorname{lcm}(12,18)=\\frac{12\\cdot18}{6}=36\\), which is **not** the product (the product is \\(216\\)).\n\n### Summary\n\nThe LCM of two numbers equals their product **iff** the numbers are relatively prime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). This occurs because the LCM \u201ccollects\u201d each distinct prime factor at its highest needed exponent, and when there\u2019s no overlap in prime factors, that collection is simply the full product of the two numbers."

      "student_answer": "**Answer: Yes, the numbers could be 3 and\u202f12.**\n\n**Why:**\n\n- The least common multiple of 3 and 12 is 12, since 12 is a multiple of both numbers and the smallest such multiple.\n- Their product is \\(3 \\times 12 = 36\\), which matches the given product.\n- Using the relationship \\( \\text{product} = \\text{LCM} \\times \\text{GCD} \\):\n  \\[\n  \\text{GCD} = \\frac{\\text{product}}{\\text{LCM}} = \\frac{36}{12} = 3,\n  \\]\n  and indeed the greatest common divisor of 3 and 12 is 3.\n\nAll the conditions are satisfied, so\u202f3 and\u202f12 are a possible pair of numbers."

The LCM, however, includes each prime factor only to the highest power it appears in either number, eliminating the duplication of the common factor (the single \\(3\\) that both numbers share). Hence the LCM is typically smaller than the product unless the two numbers are relatively prime (share no common prime factors). In this case, 9 and 15 share a factor of 3, so the LCM (45) is smaller than the product (135)."

      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of **both** numbers.  \nWhen the two numbers share a common factor, the LCM will be **smaller** than their product because the shared factor does not need to be \u201ccounted twice\u201d.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Prime\u2011factor the two numbers  \n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n10 &= 2 \\times 5 \\\\[2mm]\n15 &= 3 \\times 5\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nBoth numbers contain the factor **5**.\n\n---\n\n### 2.

Compare with the product  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Product}=10 \\times 15 = 150.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 4. Why the LCM is not equal to the product  \n\nBecause the two numbers share a common factor (the 5), that factor need not be repeated when we look for a *common* multiple.  \nIf the numbers were **coprime** (no common prime factors), the LCM would indeed equal the product. For example:\n\n- \\(\\text{LCM}(4,9)=36\\) and \\(4 \\times 9 = 36\\) (4 and 9 share no prime factors).\n\nBut for 10 and 15, the shared factor 5 reduces the LCM from 150 down to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10 \\times 15}{\\text{GCD}(10,15)} = \\frac{150}{5}=30,\n\\]\n\nwhere the greatest common divisor (GCD) is the factor that is \u201cover\u2011counted\u201d in the product.\n\n---\n\n### Summary  \n\n- Prime factorizations: \\(10 = 2 \\cdot 5\\), \\(15 = 3 \\cdot 5\\).  \n- LCM uses each prime the **maximum** number of times it appears: \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 30\\).  \n- The product is \\(150\\).  \n- Because the numbers share the factor 5, the LCM is **much smaller** than the product.  \n\nHence, the LCM of 10 and 15 is **30**, not 150."
