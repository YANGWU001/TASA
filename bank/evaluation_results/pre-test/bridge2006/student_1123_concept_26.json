      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (often called the GCF or\u202fHCF \u2013 highest common factor) of a set of whole numbers is the **largest positive integer that divides each of those numbers exactly** (i.e., with no remainder).\n\nIn other words, if you list all the factors of each number, the GCF is the biggest number that appears in every list.  \n\n**Why it matters**\n\n* **Simplifying fractions** \u2013 dividing the numerator and denominator by their GCF reduces the fraction to lowest terms.  \n* **Factoring expressions** \u2013 pulling out the GCF from a polynomial makes it easier to solve or further factor.  \n* **Solving word problems** \u2013 the GCF can represent the biggest \u201cchunk\u201d that can be shared equally among groups (e.g., the largest size of identical packages that can be made from two different supplies).\n\n**Example**\n\nFor 24 and\u202f36:  \n\n- Factors of\u202f24\u202f=\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f12,\u202f24  \n- Factors of\u202f36\u202f=\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f12,\u202f18,\u202f36  \n\nThe common factors are\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f12, and the greatest of these is **12**. So, GCF(24,\u202f36)\u202f=\u202f12.\n\nThus, the GCF tells you the biggest \u201cunit\u201d that fits evenly into each of the numbers you\u2019re comparing."
