      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into more equal sections, the total area of the square stays the same, so the area (and thus the size) of each individual part must get **smaller**. In other words, as the number of equal pieces increases, each piece occupies a smaller portion of the original square."

      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013 a square can be divided into congruent (equal\u2011shaped) triangles.  \n\n**Why it works**\n\nA square has four right\u2011angle corners and equal side lengths. By drawing straight line segments that join opposite corners, you create triangular regions whose sides are taken from the sides of the square and/or its diagonals. Because the square\u2019s sides and diagonals are all known lengths, the triangles you obtain can be made identical.\n\n**Simple examples**\n\n1. **Two triangles** \u2013 Draw one diagonal of the square. The diagonal splits the square into two right\u2011isosceles triangles. Each triangle has legs equal to the side of the square and a hypotenuse equal to the diagonal, so the two triangles are congruent.\n\n2. **Four triangles** \u2013 Draw both diagonals. The square is now divided into four right\u2011isosceles triangles, each with legs equal to half the side of the square and the same hypotenuse (the half\u2011diagonal). All four triangles are congruent.\n\n3. **Many small triangles** \u2013 Subdivide the square into a grid of smaller equal squares, then draw a diagonal in every small square. Every small square supplies two congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles, giving a large number of identical triangles covering the whole original square.\n\n**What you cannot do**\n\nYou cannot fill a square with *equilateral* triangles of the same size without leaving gaps, because the interior angles of equilateral triangles (60\u00b0) do not add up to 90\u00b0 at the corners of the square. But the requirement \u201cequal triangles\u201d does not demand that the triangles be equilateral; any shape of triangle is allowed as long as all the pieces are congruent.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBecause a square\u2019s sides and diagonals provide the necessary lengths, it is perfectly possible to partition a square into equal triangles\u2014most commonly by using one or both diagonals, or by splitting a grid of smaller squares. The only limitation is the shape of the triangle you choose; it must be compatible with the 90\u00b0 corner angles of the square."

      "student_answer": "Each small square occupies one cell of a \\(6 \\times 6\\) grid (since \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\)).  \nTherefore the side length of a small square is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{original side length}}{6}= \\frac{12}{6}=2.\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(2\\) units."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is cut into several *equal rectangles* we are guaranteeing two things:\n\n1. **All the pieces have the same area.**  \n2. **All the pieces have the same shape (they are rectangles).**\n\nA *square* is a special kind of rectangle whose two side\u2011lengths are equal.  \nIf the pieces that come out of the division are not themselves squares, at least one of the two side\u2011lengths of each piece must be different from the other.\n\n---\n\n### Why the pieces are not squares (unless we cut in a very special way)\n\nLet the side of the original square be \\(s\\). Its area is  \n\n\\[\nA_{\\text{square}} = s^{2}.\n\\]\n\nSuppose we divide the square into \\(n\\) equal rectangles.  \nEach rectangle therefore has area  \n\n\\[\nA_{\\text{rect}} = \\frac{s^{2}}{n}.\n\\]\n\nIf a rectangle were also a square, its side would be  \n\n\\[\n\\ell = \\sqrt{A_{\\text{rect}}}= \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} .\n\\]\n\nNow think about how the cuts are actually made.  \nThe usual way to split a square into rectangles is to draw a set of parallel cuts that are either **vertical** or **horizontal**.  \nLet us cut the square into \\(k\\) columns and \\(m\\) rows, so that  \n\n\\[\nk \\times m = n .\n\\]\n\nEach resulting piece then has dimensions  \n\n\\[\n\\text{width}= \\frac{s}{k}, \\qquad \n\\text{height}= \\frac{s}{m}.\n\\]\n\nFor this piece to be a square we would need  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{s}{k}= \\frac{s}{m}\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;k=m .\n\\]\n\nThus a square can be obtained only when the number of pieces \\(n\\) is a **perfect square** (e.g., \\(n=4,9,16,\\dots\\)) and the cuts are arranged in a \\(k\\times k\\) grid.  \n\nIf \\(n\\) is not a perfect square, or if we cut only in one direction (say, only vertical strips), then \\(k\\neq m\\) and the dimensions \\(\\frac{s}{k}\\) and \\(\\frac{s}{m}\\) are different. Consequently each piece is a rectangle whose length and width are unequal \u2013 it cannot be a square.\n\n---\n\n### Simple illustration\n\n* **Two equal rectangles:** Split the square with a single vertical line.  \n  - Each piece is \\( \\frac{s}{2} \\times s\\).  \n  - One side is half the other, so they are rectangles, not squares.\n\n* **Three equal rectangles:** Split with two vertical lines.  \n  - Each piece is \\( \\frac{s}{3} \\times s\\).  \n  - Again the sides differ, so they are not squares.\n\n* **Four equal pieces:** Split with one vertical and one horizontal line (a \\(2\\times2\\) grid).  \n  - Each piece is \\( \\frac{s}{2} \\times \\frac{s}{2}\\).  \n  - Here the sides are equal, so each piece *is* a smaller square.  \n\nThe fourth case is the only situation where \u201cequal rectangles\u201d happen to be squares.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nDividing a square into equal rectangles normally changes the ratio of length to width for each piece. Unless the division creates a grid whose number of cells is a perfect square (so that each cell\u2019s length equals its width), the resulting parts will have unequal side lengths and therefore cannot be squares. The rule is simple: **rectangles become squares only when the cut pattern yields equal side lengths, which requires a perfect\u2011square number of pieces arranged in a square grid.**"
