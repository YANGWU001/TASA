  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of multiplication and comparison of products, scoring well on most questions. However, there were some incorrect answers, particularly in Questions 1, 3, 6, 9, which indicate a need for more careful calculation and comparison. Overall, the student shows promise but should double-check their work for accuracy.",
