      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the multiplier if a rectangle has a length of 8 and the width is doubled?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier is **2**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a rectangle\u2019s length is multiplied by 3, what is the new length if the original length was 5?",
      "student_answer": "The new length is \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\)."
    },

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "A rectangle\u2019s area is increased by multiplying its length by 4. What is the multiplier applied to the length?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier applied to the length is **4**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "The width of a rectangle is tripled. What does the multiplier represent in this case?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier is **3** \u2013 it tells us that the rectangle\u2019s width is being increased to three\u202ftimes its original length. In other words, the new width equals the original width multiplied by 3."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If the dimensions of a rectangle are multiplied by 2, what happens to the area of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "When each side length of a rectangle is multiplied by\u202f2, the new length and width are both twice the originals.  \nSince area\u202f=\u202flength\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth, the new area becomes  \n\n\\[\n(2\\text{\u00b7length})\\times(2\\text{\u00b7width}) = 4 \\times (\\text{length}\\times\\text{width}),\n\\]\n\nso the area is multiplied by **4**. In other words, the area becomes four times larger."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A rectangle has a width of 6 meters. The width is multiplied by a factor of 5. What is the new width?",
      "student_answer": "The new width is  \n\n\\[\n6 \\text{ m} \\times 5 = 30 \\text{ meters}.\n\\]"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the multiplier used if a rectangle\u2019s width is reduced to half its original size?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier is **\u00bd (or 0.5)**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is multiplied by 7, how does the multiplier affect the perimeter of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "When the length \\(L\\) of a rectangle is multiplied by 7 the new length becomes \\(7L\\).  \nThe perimeter of a rectangle is  \n\n\\[\nP = 2(L+W)=2L+2W .\n\\]\n\nAfter the change the perimeter is  \n\n\\[\nP' = 2(7L+W)=14L+2W .\n\\]\n\nSo the \u201clength\u201d part of the perimeter is now seven times larger, while the width part stays the same. In other words, the perimeter does **not** become seven times the original perimeter; it increases by  \n\n\\[\nP' - P = (14L+2W) - (2L+2W) = 12L .\n\\]\n\nThus the multiplier of 7 on the length makes the perimeter larger by an amount equal to \\(12L\\) (or by a factor of \\(7\\) on the length\u2011contribution only)."

      "student_answer": "The multiplier applied to each dimension (length and width) is **3**."

      "question_number": 10,
