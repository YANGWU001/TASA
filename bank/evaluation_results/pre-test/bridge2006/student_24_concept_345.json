      "student_answer": "An **obtuse angle** is an angle whose measure is greater than \\(90^\\circ\\) but less than \\(180^\\circ\\). In other words, it opens wider than a right angle but does not form a straight line."

      "student_answer": "The obtuse angle is **135\u00b0**.\n\n*Explanation:*  \n- An acute angle is less than\u202f90\u00b0.  \n- A right angle is exactly\u202f90\u00b0.  \n- An obtuse angle is greater than\u202f90\u00b0 but less than\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nThus, among 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, and 135\u00b0, only 135\u00b0 meets the definition of an obtuse angle."

      "student_answer": "**Answer: Yes, a 95\u2011degree angle is obtuse.**\n\n**Explanation:**  \nAn obtuse angle is defined as any angle whose measure is **greater than 90\u00b0 but less than 180\u00b0**.  \n\n- The given angle measures **95\u00b0**.  \n- 95\u00b0\u202f>\u202f90\u00b0 (so it is larger than a right angle).  \n- 95\u00b0\u202f<\u202f180\u00b0 (so it is still less than a straight angle).\n\nBecause it satisfies both conditions, the angle is classified as **obtuse**."

      "question": "What is the difference between an obtuse angle and a right angle?",
      "student_answer": "A right angle measures exactly\u202f90\u00b0; its two sides are perpendicular to each other.  \nAn obtuse angle, on the other hand, measures **more than 90\u00b0 but less than 180\u00b0**. It is larger than a right angle, and its sides are not perpendicular.  \n\nSo the key difference is the size of the angle: a right angle is a specific 90\u2011degree angle, while an obtuse angle is any angle whose measure falls between 90\u00b0 and 180\u00b0."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "A triangle has one angle measuring 110 degrees. Is this angle obtuse?",
      "student_answer": "Yes. An obtuse angle is any angle that measures more than \\(90^\\circ\\) but less than \\(180^\\circ\\). Since the angle in the triangle measures \\(110^\\circ\\), which is greater than \\(90^\\circ\\), it is an obtuse angle."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Can an obtuse angle ever measure more than 180 degrees? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "No. By definition an obtuse angle is one that measures **greater than 90\u00b0 but less than 180\u00b0**.  \nAngles larger than 180\u00b0 are called **reflex angles**, not obtuse angles. The limit of 180\u00b0 comes from the fact that a straight line forms a 180\u00b0 angle; any angle opening wider than a straight line would have its arms crossing the line and is therefore classified differently. Hence an obtuse angle can never exceed 180\u00b0."

      "question": "Draw an obtuse angle and label its measurement.",
      "student_answer": "Below is a simple sketch of an obtuse angle (greater than 90\u00b0) with its measure labeled.\n\n```\n          \\\n           \\\n            \\ 120\u00b0\n             \\\n              \\\n               \\\n                \\________________\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n\n* The two line segments that meet at the vertex form the sides of the angle.  \n* Because the angle is wider than a right angle (90\u00b0) but less than a straight line (180\u00b0), it is **obtuse**.  \n* In the sketch the measurement is marked **120\u00b0**, which is a typical example of an obtuse angle.  \n\nTo draw it yourself:  \n\n1. Draw a short horizontal line \u2013 this will be one side of the angle.  \n2. Place the compass point at the left end of that line (the vertex).  \n3. With the compass set to a reasonably wide opening, sweep an arc that makes a clear opening larger than a right\u2011angle.  \n4. From the vertex, draw a second line that follows the arc; this is the second side of the angle.  \n5. Write the measurement (e.g., **120\u00b0**) near the opening to label it.  \n\nThe result is an obtuse angle labeled with its measure."

      "question": "If an angle measures 170 degrees, is it obtuse or acute? Provide reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "The angle is **obtuse**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- An acute angle measures less than\u202f90\u00b0.  \n- An obtuse angle measures greater than\u202f90\u00b0 but less than\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nSince\u202f170\u00b0\u202fis greater than\u202f90\u00b0 and still less than\u202f180\u00b0, it falls in the definition of an obtuse angle."
