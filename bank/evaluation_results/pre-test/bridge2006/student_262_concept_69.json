  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of multipliers in relation to rectangles. Most answers correctly identify the multiplier and its effect on dimensions and area. However, in Question 8, the explanation is overly complex and does not directly answer the question regarding the multiplier's effect on the perimeter, leading to a score of 0 for that response.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the multiplier if a rectangle has a length of 8 and the width is doubled?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier is **2** \u2013 doubling the width makes the rectangle\u2019s area twice as large."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a rectangle\u2019s length is multiplied by 3, what is the new length if the original length was 5?",
      "student_answer": "The new length would be \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "A rectangle\u2019s area is increased by multiplying its length by 4. What is the multiplier applied to the length?",
      "student_answer": "The length is multiplied by **4**, so the multiplier applied to the length is **4**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "The width of a rectangle is tripled. What does the multiplier represent in this case?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier is\u202f3.\u202fIt indicates that the rectangle\u2019s width is being scaled by a factor of three \u2013 the new width will be three times the original width."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If the dimensions of a rectangle are multiplied by 2, what happens to the area of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "When each side of a rectangle is doubled, the new area is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{new area}= (2\\cdot \\text{length})\\times(2\\cdot \\text{width}) = 4\\;(\\text{length}\\times\\text{width}),\n\\]\n\nso the area becomes **four times** the original area."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A rectangle has a width of 6 meters. The width is multiplied by a factor of 5. What is the new width?",
      "student_answer": "The new width is \\(6 \\text{ m} \\times 5 = 30 \\text{ meters}\\)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the multiplier used if a rectangle\u2019s width is reduced to half its original size?",
      "student_answer": "The width is multiplied by **\u00bd**, i.e., a multiplier of **0.5**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is multiplied by 7, how does the multiplier affect the perimeter of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "When the length \\(L\\) of a rectangle is multiplied by 7 (the width \\(W\\) stays the same), the perimeter changes as follows.\n\nThe original perimeter is  \n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{orig}} = 2(L+W).\n\\]\n\nAfter the length is enlarged to \\(7L\\), the new perimeter is  \n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{new}} = 2(7L+W)=14L+2W.\n\\]\n\nWe can relate the new perimeter to the original one:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{new}} = 2(L+W) + 12L\n               = P_{\\text{orig}} + 12L.\n\\]\n\nThus the perimeter **does not simply get multiplied by 7**.  \nThe factor by which the perimeter changes is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P_{\\text{new}}}{P_{\\text{orig}}}\n   = \\frac{14L+2W}{2(L+W)}\n   = \\frac{7L+W}{L+W}.\n\\]\n\nSo the multiplier affects the perimeter by a factor of \\(\\displaystyle\\frac{7L+W}{L+W}\\); the perimeter increases by an additional amount equal to \\(12L\\)."

      "question": "A rectangle\u2019s dimensions are scaled by multiplying both length and width by 3. What is the multiplier for each dimension?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier applied to each dimension (both the length and the width) is **3**."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "The area of a rectangle is doubled by changing the width. What multiplier was applied to the width?",
