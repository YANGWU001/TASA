      "question": "What is the multiplier if a rectangle has a length of 8 and the width is doubled?",
      "student_answer": "The width is being multiplied by **2**.  (Doubling the width applies a factor of\u202f2.)"

      "question": "If a rectangle\u2019s length is multiplied by 3, what is the new length if the original length was 5?",
      "student_answer": "The new length would be \\(5 \\times 3 = \\mathbf{15}\\)."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "A rectangle\u2019s area is increased by multiplying its length by 4. What is the multiplier applied to the length?",
      "student_answer": "The length is multiplied by **4**."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "The width of a rectangle is tripled. What does the multiplier represent in this case?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier is **3** \u2013 it tells us that the new width is three\u202ftimes the original width (i.e., the width has been increased by a factor of three)."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If the dimensions of a rectangle are multiplied by 2, what happens to the area of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "When each side length is multiplied by\u202f2, the area is multiplied by the square of that factor:\n\n\\[\n\\text{new area}= (2\\text{\u00b7length})\\times(2\\text{\u00b7width}) = 4\\,( \\text{length}\\times\\text{width}) .\n\\]\n\nSo the area becomes **four times larger**."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the multiplier used if a rectangle\u2019s width is reduced to half its original size?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier is\u202f**0.5** (one\u2011half)."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is multiplied by 7, how does the multiplier affect the perimeter of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a rectangle is  \n\n\\[\nP = 2(\\text{length}) + 2(\\text{width}) .\n\\]\n\nIf only the length is multiplied by\u202f7 (so the new length is \\(7L\\) while the width stays \\(W\\)), the new perimeter becomes  \n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{new}} = 2(7L) + 2W = 14L + 2W .\n\\]\n\nCompared with the original perimeter  \n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{old}} = 2L + 2W ,\n\\]\n\nthe length\u2011related part of the perimeter is multiplied by\u202f7, while the width\u2011related part is unchanged.  \nThus the perimeter increases by  \n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{new}} - P_{\\text{old}} = (14L + 2W) - (2L + 2W) = 12L .\n\\]\n\nIn words: the perimeter grows by adding twelve times the original length; only the \u201clength\u201d portion of the perimeter is scaled by the factor\u202f7."
