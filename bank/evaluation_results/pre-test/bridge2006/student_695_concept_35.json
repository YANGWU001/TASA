      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 4 smaller squares are formed."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "A square is divided into 9 equal sections. What shape are the sections?",
      "student_answer": "The square is divided into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, so each of the 9 equal sections is itself a **smaller square**."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into 16 equal smaller squares, the pieces are arranged in a grid of equal rows and columns.  \n\nSince \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\),\n\n- **Rows:**\u202f4  \n- **Columns:**\u202f4  \n\nSo there are **4 rows and 4 columns** of the smaller squares."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "A square is divided into 25 equal parts. How many parts are in each row?",
      "student_answer": "The 25 equal parts form a square grid.  \nSince a square grid has the same number of parts in each row and each column, we find the number per side by taking the square root of the total number of parts:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{25}=5\n\\]\n\n**Answer: 5 parts in each row.**"

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into more equal sections, each individual part becomes **smaller**.  \n\nDividing the square means you are sharing the same total area among a larger number of pieces, so the area (and consequently the side length of each piece, if the pieces are also squares) must decrease. In other words, the more equal parts you create, the less space each part occupies."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "If a square is divided horizontally and vertically into 4 equal sections, what is the shape of each section?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the four sections is itself a **square**.  \n\nDividing the original square once horizontally and once vertically creates a 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 grid. The lines intersect at the center, producing four congruent pieces, each having four equal sides and right\u2011angle corners \u2013 exactly the definition of a square."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013 a square can be divided into equal (congruent) triangles.  \nThe simplest way to do this is to draw one of the square\u2019s diagonals. The diagonal splits the square into two right\u2011isosceles triangles that have exactly the same shape and size, so they are equal.\n\nBecause a square is a polygon, it can be **triangulated** in many different ways: any set of non\u2011overlapping triangles whose vertices are among the square\u2019s vertices or interior points will fill the whole square. For example, drawing **both** diagonals creates four smaller right\u2011isosceles triangles that are all congruent, and you can keep subdividing those triangles further to get even more equal pieces.\n\nWhat you cannot do is tile a square with congruent **equilateral** triangles, because the interior angle of an equilateral triangle is 60\u00b0, and 360\u00b0 cannot be divided into an integer number of 60\u00b0 angles around a point without leaving gaps. But for right\u2011isosceles (or other) triangles, a perfect division is entirely possible."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "Since the 36 small squares must form a \\(6 \\times 6\\) grid (because \\(\\sqrt{36}=6\\)), each side of the original square is split into 6 equal segments.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Side length of each small square}= \\frac{12}{6}=2\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** Each smaller square has side length **2** (units)."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is cut into several **equal** rectangles, each piece must have the same dimensions as every other piece.  \nA square has all four sides equal, so its side\u2011length ratio is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{width}}{\\text{height}} = 1 .\n\\]\n\nIf we make a division that is parallel to one pair of sides (the usual way to get rectangles), the new pieces keep the **full height** of the original square but share its width, or vice\u2011versa.  \n\n* Example: Cutting a square of side\u202f\\(s\\) into two equal vertical pieces gives two pieces each of size  \n\\[\n\\text{width}= \\frac{s}{2},\\qquad \\text{height}=s .\n\\]  \nTheir width\u2011to\u2011height ratio is \\(\\frac{s/2}{s}= \\tfrac12\\), not 1, so each piece is a rectangle, not a square.  \n\n* More generally, if the square is divided into \\(n\\) equal strips (either vertical or horizontal), each strip has dimensions  \n\n\\[\n\\text{width}= \\frac{s}{n},\\qquad \\text{height}=s \\quad\\text{(or the reverse)},\n\\]  \n\ngiving a ratio \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) (or \\(n\\)), which is different from 1 for any \\(n>1\\).  \n\nOnly when \\(n = 1\\) \u2013 i.e., when we do **no** division at all \u2013 does the piece remain a square. Therefore, dividing a square into more than one equal rectangle necessarily changes the side\u2011length ratio, and the resulting parts cannot be squares; they are rectangles."

      "question": "Draw a square divided into 9 equal sections and label the dimensions of each smaller square if the original square has a side length of 3 units.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\n1. **Divide the original square into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid** \u2013 draw two equally\u2011spaced vertical lines and two equally\u2011spaced horizontal lines.  \n2. **Each small square\u2019s side length:**  \n\n\\[\n\\text{small\u2011square side}=\\frac{\\text{original side}}{3}= \\frac{3\\text{ units}}{3}=1\\text{ unit}.\n\\]\n\n3. **Labeling** \u2013 inside each of the nine little squares write \u201c1\u202funit\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202funit\u201d (or simply \u201c1\u202funit\u201d on each side).  \n\nSo the picture looks like this (the numbers are the side lengths of the smaller squares):\n\n```\n+---+---+---+\n|1u |1u |1u |\n+---+---+---+\n|1u |1u |1u |\n+---+---+---+\n|1u |1u |1u |\n+---+---+---+\n```\n\n**Result:** The original 3\u2011unit\u2011by\u20113\u2011unit square is now split into 9 equal smaller squares, each measuring **1 unit on a side**."
