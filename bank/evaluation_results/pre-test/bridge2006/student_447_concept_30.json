      "student_answer": "To find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 12 and 18, you can list the factors of each number or use prime factorization.\n\n**Method 1 \u2013 List the factors**\n\n- Factors of 12:\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f12  \n- Factors of 18:\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f18  \n\nThe common factors are **1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f6**. The largest of these is **6**, so the GCF is 6.\n\n**Method 2 \u2013 Prime factorization**\n\n- 12\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3  \n- 18\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3  \n\nThe common prime factors are one 2 and one 3, which multiply to **2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f6**.\n\nSo, the GCF of 12 and 18 is **6**.

      "student_answer": "I think the greatest common factor of 24 and\u202f36 is 12, so you could make **12 equal groups** (each group would have 2 apples and 3 oranges)."

      "question": "Explain how the GCF helps in dividing items into equal groups.",
      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) tells us the biggest size that can be used for each group **and** still let every item be placed in a group without leftovers.  \n\nWhen you have a certain number of items and you want to split them into equal piles, you look for the largest number that can divide each of the original amounts exactly. That largest divisor is the GCF.  \n\nFor example, if you have 24 apples and 36 oranges and you want the same number of pieces of fruit in each basket, you find the GCF of 24 and 36, which is 12.\u202fThat means you can make baskets that each contain 12 pieces of fruit (some apples and some oranges), and you\u2019ll end up with whole baskets and no fruit left over.  \n\nIn general, the steps are:\n\n1. List the factors of each quantity (or use prime\u2011factorization).  \n2. Identify the common factors.  \n3. Choose the greatest one \u2013 that\u2019s the GCF.  \n4. Use that number as the size of each group; the total number of groups will be the original amount divided by the GCF.\n\nSo the GCF helps you figure out the biggest possible group size that will let you divide the items evenly, ensuring that every group has the same number of items and nothing is left over. (I think this is the main idea; sometimes people also use the GCF to find the *number* of groups instead of the size of each group, but the principle is the same.)"

      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor of 45 and\u202f60 is **5**.  \nIf you make groups that are all the same size, each group would contain **5 items**.  \n\n- For the 45 items, you would get \\(45 \u00f7 5 = 9\\) groups.  \n- For the 60 items, you would get \\(60 \u00f7 5 = 12\\) groups.  \n\nSo you can divide the 45\u2011item set into 9 equal groups of 5, and the 60\u2011item set into 12 equal groups of 5."

      "student_answer": "One everyday example is when you want to make identical \u201cstarter kits\u201d for a class project.  \nSuppose a teacher has **24\u202fpencils** and **36\u202ferasers** and wants to put the same number of each item into each kit so that no pencil or eraser is left over.  \n\nTo figure out how many kits can be made, you look for the greatest common factor (GCF) of the two quantities.  \nThe GCF of 24 and 36 is **12** (both numbers are divisible by 12).  \n\nSo you can make **12 kits**.  \nEach kit would then contain  \n\n* 24\u202f\u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f2 pencils, and  \n* 36\u202f\u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f3 erasers.  \n\n(If you wanted the kits to have the same total number of items, you could also think of grouping the pencils and erasers together; the GCF tells you the largest group size that works for both.)  \n\nI think this shows how finding the GCF helps you organize the supplies into equal groups without any leftovers."

In other words, you could arrange the 72 items into groups of 18 (giving you 4 groups) and the 90 items into groups of 18 (giving you 5 groups), and you wouldn\u2019t have any leftover items in either case. This \u201clargest common group size\u2019\u2019 is what the GCF measures."

      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor of 48\u202fand\u202f64 is **16**.\n\nSo the teacher could make groups that each contain **16 items**.  \n\n- For the markers: 48\u202f\u00f7\u202f16\u202f=\u202f3 groups of markers (each group has 16 markers).  \n- For the crayons: 64\u202f\u00f7\u202f16\u202f=\u202f4 groups of crayons (each group has 16 crayons).\n\nThus the largest equal\u2011size grouping is 16 items per group, giving 3 marker groups and 4 crayon groups."
