      "question": "Explain why the LCM of two numbers is sometimes equal to their product.",
      "student_answer": "The least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is related to their greatest common divisor (GCD) by the well\u2011known formula  \n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{LCM}(a,b)\\;\\times\\;\\gcd(a,b)=a\\;b .\n\\]\n\nFrom this equation we can see when the LCM will be equal to the product \\(ab\\).\n\n---\n\n### When does \\(\\operatorname{LCM}(a,b)=ab\\)?\n\nThe equality \\(\\operatorname{LCM}(a,b)=ab\\) holds **exactly when** the greatest common divisor of the two numbers is 1:\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(a,b)=1 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; \\operatorname{LCM}(a,b)=\\frac{ab}{\\gcd(a,b)}=\\frac{ab}{1}=ab .\n\\]\n\nIn other words, the two numbers must be **relatively prime** (or **coprime**).  \nIf the numbers share no common prime factor, none of the prime factors needs to be \u201cre\u2011used\u201d when constructing a common multiple, so the smallest common multiple is simply the product of all the prime factors\u2014i.e., the product of the two numbers themselves.\n\n---\n\n### Why does this happen? (Intuitive view)\n\nWrite each number as a product of primes:\n\n\\[\na = p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\\dots p_k^{e_k},\\qquad  \nb = q_1^{f_1}q_2^{f_2}\\dots q_m^{f_m}.\n\\]\n\nIf \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are coprime, the sets \\(\\{p_i\\}\\) and \\(\\{q_j\\}\\) are disjoint; there is no prime that appears in both factorizations.  \n\n* The **GCD** takes the *minimum* exponent for each prime that appears in *both* numbers. Since there are no common primes, the minimum exponent is 0 for every prime, giving \\(\\gcd(a,b)=1\\).\n\n* The **LCM** takes the *maximum* exponent for each prime that appears in *either* number. Because the prime sets are disjoint, the LCM simply includes every prime factor of \\(a\\) and every prime factor of \\(b\\) at the exponents they already have. Multiplying those together reproduces the product \\(ab\\).\n\n---\n\n### Example\n\n- \\(a = 8 = 2^3\\)  \n- \\(b = 15 = 3 \\cdot 5\\)\n\n\\(\\gcd(8,15)=1\\) (no common prime factor).  \n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{LCM}(8,15)=2^3\\cdot3^1\\cdot5^1 = 8\\cdot15 = 120 .\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nThe LCM of two numbers equals their product **iff** the numbers are relatively prime, i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1. This follows directly from the relationship \\(\\operatorname{LCM}(a,b)\\times\\gcd(a,b)=ab\\) and the fact that when no prime factor is shared, the \u201coverlap\u201d captured by the GCD disappears, leaving the LCM to be the full product."

      "student_answer": "Yes, the two numbers could be **3 and\u202f12**.\n\n**Why it works**\n\n1. **Least common multiple (LCM).**  \n   The LCM of 3 and 12 is the smallest multiple that both numbers share.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Multiples of }3:\\;3,\\;6,\\;9,\\;12,\\dots\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Multiples of }12:\\;12,\\;24,\\dots\n   \\]\n   The smallest common multiple is 12, so \\(\\operatorname{LCM}(3,12)=12\\).\n\n2. **Product.**  \n   \\[\n   3 \\times 12 = 36,\n   \\]\n   which matches the given product.\n\n3. **Consistency check with the LCM\u2011GCD relationship.**  \n   For any two positive integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\),\n   \\[\n   \\operatorname{LCM}(a,b) \\times \\operatorname{GCD}(a,b) = a \\times b.\n   \\]\n   Here the product is 36 and the LCM is 12, so the implied greatest common divisor would be\n   \\[\n   \\operatorname{GCD}(a,b)=\\frac{a\\times b}{\\operatorname{LCM}(a,b)}=\\frac{36}{12}=3,\n   \\]\n   which indeed is the GCD of 3 and 12.\n\nSince the pair (3,\u202f12) satisfies both the LCM condition (12) and the product condition (36), it is a valid solution."

The LCM equals the product (35) because the two numbers share no factors other than 1.

      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nOne example is the pair  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6\\ \\text{and}\\ 9}\n\\]\n\n**Why the LCM is less than the product**\n\nFor any two positive integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\),\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(a,b)=\\frac{a\\cdot b}{\\gcd(a,b)} .\n\\]\n\nThus the LCM will be **smaller than the product** \\(a\\cdot b\\) precisely when the greatest common divisor \\(\\gcd(a,b)\\) is greater than\u202f1.\n\n- For the numbers 6 and 9  \n  \\[\n  \\gcd(6,9)=3>1 .\n  \\]\n- Their product is  \n  \\[\n  6\\times 9 = 54 .\n  \\]\n- Their least common multiple is  \n  \\[\n  \\text{LCM}(6,9)=\\frac{6\\times 9}{3}= \\frac{54}{3}=18 .\n  \\]\n\nSince \\(18 < 54\\), the LCM is indeed less than the product.\n\n**General rule**\n\nAny two numbers that share a common factor greater than\u202f1 (i.e., are not relatively prime) will satisfy\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(a,b)=\\frac{a\\cdot b}{\\gcd(a,b)} < a\\cdot b .\n\\]\n\nSo picking any non\u2011coprime pair\u2014such as \\(8\\) and \\(12\\), \\(15\\) and \\(25\\), etc.\u2014will give the same result.

      "question": "Why is the LCM of 10 and 15 not equal to their product? Show the calculation process.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of **both** numbers.  \nThe product of the two numbers is always a common multiple, but it is usually **not** the *least* one\u2014except when the numbers have no common prime factors (i.e., they are relatively prime).\n\n---\n\n### 1. Factor the numbers\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n10 &= 2 \\times 5 \\\\\n15 &= 3 \\times 5\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nBoth numbers share the prime factor \\(5\\).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Build the LCM from the highest powers of all prime factors\n\n- Prime \\(2\\): appears only in \\(10\\) \u2192 keep \\(2^1\\).\n- Prime \\(3\\): appears only in \\(15\\) \u2192 keep \\(3^1\\).\n- Prime \\(5\\): appears in both, highest power is \\(5^1\\).\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}=2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 30\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 3. Verify that 30 is a multiple of both 10 and 15\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n30 \\div 10 &= 3 \\quad (\\text{integer})\\\\\n30 \\div 15 &= 2 \\quad (\\text{integer})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nThus 30 is a common multiple, and any smaller positive integer fails to be divisible by both 10 and 15. Hence **30 is the LCM**.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Compare with the product\n\n\\[\n\\text{Product}=10 \\times 15 = 150\n\\]\n\n150 is also a common multiple (since any product of the two numbers will be a multiple of each), but it is **larger** than necessary. The LCM picks the *least* such number, so:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(10,15)=30 \\neq 150\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Why the difference?\n\nThe product includes **all** prime factors of each number **with their full multiplicities**, even the ones they share. The LCM only needs each shared factor once (the highest exponent among the two numbers). Because 10 and 15 share the factor 5, the product \u201cdouble\u2011counts\u201d that factor, inflating the result from 30 to 150.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The LCM of 10 and 15 is 30, not 150, because the LCM takes each prime factor at its highest required power, avoiding the unnecessary duplication that occurs when simply multiplying the two numbers."
