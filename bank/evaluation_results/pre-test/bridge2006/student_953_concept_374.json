  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of identifying the tens digit in various numbers, correctly answering 9 out of 10 questions. The only mistake was in Question 3, where the student incorrectly identified the tens digit in 382 as 8 instead of the correct answer, which is 8. This indicates a potential misunderstanding of place value in two-digit numbers. Overall, the student has a solid grasp of the concept.",
