      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into 4 equal parts, each part is itself a smaller square of identical size. Therefore, the division creates **4 smaller squares**."

      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into a greater number of equal sections, the total area of the square stays the same, but that area is shared among more pieces.\u202fConsequently, the area (and thus the size) of each individual part becomes smaller. The more equal sections you create, the smaller each part will be."

      "question": "If a square is divided horizontally and vertically into 4 equal sections, what is the shape of each section?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the four sections is itself a **square**.  By drawing one horizontal line and one vertical line through the centre of the original square, the shape is divided into four congruent smaller squares."

      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013 a square can be tiled with congruent (equal\u2011size) triangles, but the number of triangles must be even.  \n\n**Why it works**\n\n* Draw a diagonal of the square.  \n  The diagonal splits the square into two right\u2011isosceles triangles that are exactly the same size and shape, so the square is now a union of two equal triangles.\n\n* More generally, you can divide a square into any even number of congruent triangles.  \n  For example, join the mid\u2011points of the four sides; the four pieces you obtain are congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles.  \n  By repeatedly bisecting each of those triangles with a line through its right\u2011angle vertex, you can get 8, 16, 32, \u2026 equal triangles.\n\n**Why an odd number won\u2019t work**\n\nA triangle has three interior angles that sum to 180\u00b0. In a square the total interior angle around any interior point is 360\u00b0. If you try to fill the square with an odd number of congruent triangles, the angles at the vertices where the triangles meet cannot add up to the required 360\u00b0, so the pieces cannot fit together without gaps or overlaps. Consequently a square cannot be partitioned into an odd number of congruent triangles.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nA square can certainly be divided into equal triangles (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8, \u2026 of them). The key restriction is that the number of congruent triangles must be even; otherwise the angles cannot be arranged to fill the square completely."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "Each smaller square will have a side length of  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{original side}}{\\sqrt{36}}=\\frac{12}{6}=2.\n\\]\n\nSo the side of each of the 36 equal squares is **2 units**."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is cut into several equal rectangles, the resulting pieces cannot all be squares because of the definition of a square and the way the division works.\n\n1. **Definition of a square** \u2013 A square is a special type of rectangle whose *four* sides are all equal in length. In other words, a square\u2019s length and width must be the same.\n\n2. **How the division is performed** \u2013  \n   *If we cut the square by drawing lines parallel to one side*: each piece keeps the full height of the original square but its width is reduced in proportion to the number of pieces. The width is now **smaller** than the height, so the pieces are rectangles, not squares.  \n   *If we cut by drawing a grid (both horizontal and vertical lines)*: each small piece has the same height and the same width as every other piece, but the common height\u2011to\u2011width ratio is the original side length divided by the number of rows (or columns). Unless we make exactly one piece (i.e., we don\u2019t cut at all), that ratio will be different from 1, so the pieces are rectangles, not squares.\n\n3. **Why they can\u2019t be squares** \u2013 For any division that creates **more than one** part, at least one dimension of each part must be shortened relative to the original side length. Since the original side length is the same in both directions, shortening only one direction makes the two side lengths unequal. Unequal side lengths mean the shape is a rectangle, not a square.\n\nIn short, the only way to obtain squares from a square by \u201cdividing\u201d it is to leave the square whole (one piece) or to cut it into smaller squares of the same side length, which requires the original side length to be an integer multiple of the small\u2011square side. If you simply split the square into equal *rectangles* (i.e., equal area pieces with the same shape), those pieces will have a different length\u2011to\u2011width ratio than 1, so they are rectangles, not squares."

      "question": "Draw a square divided into 9 equal sections and label the dimensions of each smaller square if the original square has a side length of 3 units.",
      "student_answer": "Here is a simple sketch of the large square (side\u202f=\u202f3\u202funits) divided into **9 equal smaller squares** \u2013 a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid:\n\n```\n+-----+-----+-----+\n|     |     |     |\n|  1  |  2  |  3  |\n|     |     |     |\n+-----+-----+-----+\n|     |     |     |\n|  4  |  5  |  6  |\n|     |     |     |\n+-----+-----+-----+\n|     |     |     |\n|  7  |  8  |  9  |\n|     |     |     |\n+-----+-----+-----+\n```\n\n**Dimensions of each smaller square**\n\n- The original square\u2019s side length is 3\u202funits.\n- It is divided into 3 equal parts along each side (3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid).\n- Therefore, the side length of each smaller square =  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{3\\ \\text{units}}{3}=1\\ \\text{unit}.\n\\]\n\nSo **each of the nine small squares is a 1\u2011unit\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u2011unit square**."
