      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Neither product is larger; they are the same.\n\n**Explanation:**  \n- \\(5 \\times 8 = 40\\)  \n- \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\)  \n\nBoth calculations give 40, so the two quantities are equal."

      "student_answer": "Multiplying the numbers gives:\n\n- \\(7 \\times 6 = 42\\)\n- \\(8 \\times 5 = 40\\)\n\nSince \\(42 > 40\\), the product of **7 multiplied by 6** is larger than the product of **8 multiplied by 5**."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What is the larger product: 3 x 9 or 2 x 12?",
      "student_answer": "The product of \\(3 \\times 9\\) is \\(27\\).\n\nThe product of \\(2 \\times 12\\) is \\(24\\).\n\nSince \\(27 > 24\\), the larger product is **\\(3 \\times 9 = 27\\)**."

      "question": "Compare: Is 10 x 3 larger than 7 x 4?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes.  \n\n**Why:**  \n- \\(10 \\times 3 = 30\\)  \n- \\(7 \\times 4 = 28\\)  \n\nSince \\(30\\) is greater than \\(28\\), \\(10 \\times 3\\) is the larger quantity."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** The second farmer planted more trees.\n\n**Explanation:**  \n- First farmer: \\(4 \\text{ rows} \\times 9 \\text{ trees per row} = 36\\) trees.  \n- Second farmer: \\(6 \\text{ rows} \\times 7 \\text{ trees per row} = 42\\) trees.  \n\nSince \\(42 > 36\\), the farmer with 6 rows of 7 trees each planted more trees."
