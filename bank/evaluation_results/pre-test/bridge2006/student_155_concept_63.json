      "student_answer": "Percentages are a handy way of expressing a portion of a whole, so they\u2019re frequently used to work out \u201cparts\u201d of quantities in everyday situations. The basic idea is that a percentage tells you how many hundredths of something you have, and you can turn that into an actual amount by multiplying (or dividing) by the total amount.\n\n### The basic formula  \n\nIf you know the **whole** (the total amount) and the **percentage** you want, the part is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Part} = \\frac{\\text{Percentage}}{100}\\times \\text{Whole}.\n\\]\n\nConversely, if you have the part and you need the whole, you **divide the part by the percentage expressed as a decimal**:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Whole} = \\frac{\\text{Part}}{\\text{Percentage (as a decimal)}}.\n\\]\n\n*(A common slip\u2011up at this level is to divide by the percentage itself (e.g.,\u202f25) instead of the decimal (0.25); remembering to convert to a decimal first avoids that error.)*\n\n### Real\u2011world examples  \n\n| Scenario | What you know | What you calculate | How you use the percentage formula |\n|----------|---------------|-------------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Discounts** | Original price = \\$80, discount = 15\u202f% | Sale price | Sale price = \\$80\u00a0\u2013 (0.15\u202f\u00d7\u202f\\$80) = \\$68 |\n| **Sales tax** | Purchase amount = \\$120, tax rate = 8\u202f% | Total cost | Total = \\$120\u00a0+ (0.08\u202f\u00d7\u202f\\$120) = \\$129.60 |\n| **Interest earnings** | Principal = \\$1,000, annual interest = 3.5\u202f% | Interest earned | Interest = 0.035\u202f\u00d7\u202f\\$1,000 = \\$35 |\n| **Grades** | Total points possible = 200, student earned 162 points | Percentage grade | % = (162\u202f\u00f7\u202f200)\u202f\u00d7\u202f100 = 81\u202f% |\n| **Population statistics** | City population = 250,000, 12\u202f% are under 18 | Number of children | Children = 0.12\u202f\u00d7\u202f250,000 = 30,000 |\n| **Recipe scaling** | Original recipe serves 4, you need to serve 10 (250\u202f% of the original) | Ingredient amounts | New amount = 2.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f(original amount) |\n\n### Steps you usually follow  \n\n1. **Identify what you have** \u2013 the whole amount, the part, or the percentage.  \n2. **Convert the percentage to a decimal** (divide by 100).  \n3. **Apply the right rearranged formula** (multiply to find a part, divide to find a whole).  \n4. **Check the units** (dollars, people, grams, etc.) and round sensibly.\n\n### Why it matters  \n\n- **Budgeting:** Knowing what fraction of your income goes to rent, food, or savings helps you manage money.  \n- **Shopping:** Calculating discounts and tax lets you compare prices accurately.  \n- **Finance:** Interest rates and loan percentages determine how much you\u2019ll pay over time.  \n- **Health & Demographics:** Percentages of a population with a certain condition guide public\u2011health decisions.  \n- **Cooking & Crafting:** Scaling recipes or material quantities ensures you have enough without waste.\n\nIn short, percentages turn abstract \u201cparts of a whole\u201d into concrete numbers you can use for planning, decision\u2011making, and problem\u2011solving in everyday life."

      "student_answer": "Calculating a part of a whole can be done either with **percentages** or with **fractions**, and the two methods are essentially the same idea expressed in different forms.\n\n| Aspect | Percentages | Fractions |\n|--------|-------------|-----------|\n| **Notation** | Uses the symbol \u201c%\u201d. For example, 30\u202f% means 30 out of every 100. | Uses a numerator\u202f/\u202fdenominator. For example, 3/10 means 3 out of every 10. |\n| **Conversion** | To turn a percentage into a usable factor, divide by 100 (e.g., 30\u202f% \u2192 0.30). | A fraction is already a factor; you can also convert it to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator (e.g., 3/10 \u2192 0.30). |\n| **Typical use** | Often used when the problem tells you \u201cwhat percent of \u2026\u201d. | Common when the problem gives a ratio or a part\u2011of\u2011whole expressed as a fraction. |\n| **Calculation steps** | 1. Convert the percent to a decimal (percent \u00f7\u202f100). 2. Multiply the decimal by the whole quantity. | 1. Keep the fraction as is (or simplify). 2. Multiply the fraction by the whole quantity (numerator\u202f\u00d7\u202fwhole \u00f7\u202fdenominator). |\n| **Example** | Find 30\u202f% of 80: 0.30\u202f\u00d7\u202f80 = 24. | Find 3/10 of 80: (3\u202f\u00d7\u202f80) \u00f7\u202f10 = 24. |\n\n**Key difference:**  \n- **Form of expression** \u2013 Percentages are always out of 100, while fractions can have any denominator that reflects the size of the whole.  \n- **Conversion step** \u2013 When using percentages you must first divide by 100 to get a decimal factor; with fractions you can multiply directly (or convert to a decimal if you prefer).  \n\nIn practice, both methods give the same result; you just choose the form that matches how the information is presented or which is more convenient for the calculation."
