  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of comparing sums, correctly identifying larger quantities in most cases. However, there were a few incorrect answers, particularly in Questions 1, 6, and 8, indicating some confusion in basic addition or comparison. Encouraging the student to double-check their calculations could help improve accuracy.",
