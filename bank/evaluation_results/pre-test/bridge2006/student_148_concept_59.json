      "student_answer": "The only improper fraction in the list is **7/5**, because its numerator (7) is larger than its denominator (5).  \n\nThe other fractions (3/4, 2/3, and 5/6) all have numerators smaller than their denominators, so they are proper fractions."

      "student_answer": "An **improper fraction** is a fraction whose numerator is **greater than or equal to** its denominator (while the denominator is non\u2011zero). In other words, the top number is at least as large as the bottom number, so the value of the fraction is\u202f\u2265\u202f1.  \n\n*Example:* \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{7}{5}\\) (7\u202f\u2265\u202f5) and \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{4}{4}=1\\) are both improper fractions.  \n\nIf the numerator is smaller than the denominator, the fraction is called a **proper fraction**."

      "question": "Why is 11/10 classified as an improper fraction?",
      "student_answer": "A fraction is called **improper** when its numerator is larger than its denominator, which means the value of the fraction is greater than\u202f1.\n\nFor the fraction \\(\\dfrac{11}{10}\\):\n\n- Numerator\u202f=\u202f11  \n- Denominator\u202f=\u202f10  \n\nSince \\(11 > 10\\), the fraction represents the number \\(1.1\\), which is larger than the whole number\u202f1. Therefore \\(\\dfrac{11}{10}\\) meets the definition of an improper fraction."

This is an improper fraction.  \n- \\(\\frac{4}{6}\\): numerator\u202f=\u202f4, denominator\u202f=\u202f6 \u2192 \\(4 < 6\\). Proper (and simplifies to \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)).  \n- \\(\\frac{5}{10}\\): numerator\u202f=\u202f5, denominator\u202f=\u202f10 \u2192 \\(5 < 10\\).
