      "student_answer": "The least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of **both** of them.\n\n- Multiples of\u202f5 are\u20035,\u202f10,\u202f15,\u202f20,\u202f25,\u202f\u2026  \n- Multiples of\u202f20 are\u200320,\u202f40,\u202f60,\u202f\u2026\n\nLooking at the two lists, the first number that appears in **both** lists is **20**.  \n\nSince 20 can be written as \\(5 \\times 4\\) (so it\u2019s a multiple of 5) and also as \\(20 \\times 1\\) (so it\u2019s a multiple of 20), it satisfies the definition of a common multiple.  \n\nBecause there is no smaller positive number that is a multiple of both 5 and 20, the **least** common multiple is 20."

      "question": "True or False: If one number is a multiple of another, their LCM is always the larger number. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer: True**\n\n**Justification:**  \nIf one number is a multiple of the other, say \\(b = k \\times a\\) for some integer \\(k \\ge 1\\), then every common multiple of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be a multiple of \\(b\\). The smallest such common multiple is therefore \\(b\\) itself. Hence the least common multiple (LCM) of the two numbers is the larger number, \\(b\\)."

      "question": "A student claims the LCM of 7 and 21 is 7. Is this correct? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "No, the claim is **not correct**.  \n\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of two integers is the **smallest positive number that is a multiple of both**.  \n\n- Multiples of 7 are\u20037,\u202f14,\u202f21,\u202f28,\u202f\u2026  \n- Multiples of 21 are\u200321,\u202f42,\u202f63,\u202f\u2026\n\nThe smallest number that appears in both lists is **21**.  \n\nSince 7 is a multiple of 7 but **not** a multiple of 21, it cannot be the LCM of 7 and 21. Therefore the correct LCM is 21, not 7."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If the LCM of two numbers is the larger number, what can you infer about their relationship?",
      "student_answer": "Since the least common multiple turns out to be the larger of the two numbers, the larger number must already contain all the prime factors of the smaller one. In other words, the larger number is a multiple of the smaller number (the smaller divides the larger)."

      "student_answer": "The least\u2011common multiple of 15 and 45 is **45**.\n\n**Why?**  \nSince\u202f45\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f15, the larger number (45) is already a multiple of the smaller one (15). When one number is a multiple of the other, the LCM is simply the larger number, because it is the smallest number that both can divide into without remainder. No further factor\u2011finding or multiplication is needed."
