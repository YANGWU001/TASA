      "student_answer": "A proper fraction is a fraction whose numerator is **smaller** than its denominator. Because the top number (the numerator) is less than the bottom number (the denominator), the value of a proper fraction is always **less than\u202f1**.  \n\n**Example:** \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{3}{5}\\) is a proper fraction because \\(3 < 5\\)."

      "student_answer": "\\( \\displaystyle \\frac{2}{3} \\) is called a proper fraction because its numerator (2) is **smaller** than its denominator (3).  \nWhen the top number is less than the bottom number, the value of the fraction is **less than\u202f1**. Since a proper fraction is defined as any fraction whose absolute value is between 0 and 1 (i.e., not an improper or mixed number), \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) satisfies that condition.  \n\nSo the key points are:\n\n1. Numerator\u202f=\u202f2, denominator\u202f=\u202f3.  \n2. 2\u202f<\u202f3 \u21d2 the fraction\u2019s magnitude is less than 1.  \n3. By definition, fractions with a value <\u202f1 are proper fractions.  \n\nTherefore, \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) is a proper fraction."
