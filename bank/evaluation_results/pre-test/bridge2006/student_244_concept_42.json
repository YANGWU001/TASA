      "question": "If a horizontal bar is divided into 10 equal parts, how much of the bar does each section represent as a fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think each of the 10 sections would be about one\u2011fifth of the whole bar, so maybe each part is\u202f\\( \\frac{1}{5} \\)\u202fof the bar."
