      "question": "Describe how you would divide a circle into 5 equal sections.",
      "student_answer": "To cut a circle into five equal parts you need to create five equal central angles of\u202f72\u00b0 (since 360\u00b0\u202f\u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f72\u00b0). Here\u2019s a simple step\u2011by\u2011step way to do it with just a ruler, a compass and a protractor (or any angle\u2011measuring tool):\n\n1. **Find the centre** \u2013 Mark the exact centre of the circle and label it\u202fO.\n\n2. **Draw a starting radius** \u2013 From O draw any straight line to the circumference. Call the point where it meets the circle\u202fA. This will be the first \u201ccut\u201d line.\n\n3. **Measure the first angle** \u2013 Place the protractor\u2019s centre on O, align the 0\u00b0 mark with line\u202fOA, and make a small mark on the circle at 72\u00b0.\n\n4. **Draw the second radius** \u2013 From O draw a line through that 72\u00b0 mark to the edge of the circle. Call the new point\u202fB. You now have two equal slices (\u2220AOB\u202f=\u202f72\u00b0).\n\n5. **Repeat the process** \u2013 Keeping the protractor centred at O, measure another 72\u00b0 from line\u202fOB (i.e., at 144\u00b0 from the original line) and draw the third radius to point\u202fC. Continue:  \n   * 216\u00b0 \u2192 point\u202fD  \n   * 288\u00b0 \u2192 point\u202fE  \n\n   After you draw the fifth line (from O through point\u202fE) you will have five radii (OA, OB, OC, OD, OE) that split the circle into five equal sectors.\n\n6. **Check your work** \u2013 The arcs between consecutive points A\u2011B, B\u2011C, C\u2011D, D\u2011E, and E\u2011A should all look the same, and each central angle should measure 72\u00b0.\n\n### Alternative \u201cfold\u201d method (no protractor)\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a protractor you can use a compass\u2011based trick:\n\n1. **Draw a diameter** \u2013 Draw a straight line through the centre, giving two opposite points, say\u202fP and\u202fQ.\n\n2. **Mark a chord** \u2013 Using the compass, set a radius equal to the circle\u2019s radius. With the compass point on P, draw an arc that cuts the circle at a point\u202fR. Without changing the compass width, place the point on R and draw another arc that cuts the circle at\u202fS, and continue around the circle (R \u2192 S \u2192 T \u2192 \u2026).  \n\n   Because each step uses the same radius, the chords you create are equal, and after four steps you\u2019ll land back at Q, giving you five equal arcs (P\u2011R\u2011S\u2011T\u2011U\u2011Q).  \n\n3. **Draw radii** \u2013 Connect O to each of the points you marked (P, R, S, T, U). Those radii divide the circle into five equal parts.\n\nEither method will give you five equal sectors, each covering 72\u00b0 of the circle."
