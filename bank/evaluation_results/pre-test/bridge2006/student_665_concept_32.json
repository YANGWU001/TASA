      "question": "A vertical bar is split into 5 equal sections. What fraction of the bar does each section represent?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the\u202f5\u202fequal sections represents one\u2011fifth of the whole bar:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Fraction per section}= \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]"

      "question": "A vertical bar is divided into 6 parts. How would you express the fraction of 2 pieces combined?",
      "student_answer": "The bar is split into 6 equal pieces. Two of those pieces make  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{6}\n\\]\n\nwhich simplifies by dividing numerator and denominator by\u202f2:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{6}= \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{2}{6}\\) (or \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{3}\\))."

      "question": "If a vertical bar is divided into 3 equal parts, which fraction represents 2 of those parts?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{2}{3}\\)\n\n**Explanation:**  \nDividing a vertical bar into 3 equal parts means each part represents one\u2011third of the whole, i.e., \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\). If we take 2 of those equal parts, we have \\(2 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\\) of the whole bar."

      "question": "How many pieces would a vertical bar be divided into if each piece represents 1/8 of the bar?",
      "student_answer": "The bar would be divided into **8 pieces**, because each piece makes up\u202f\\( \\frac{1}{8} \\)\u202fof the whole bar (and \\(8 \\times \\frac{1}{8}=1\\))."

      "question": "A vertical bar is divided into 10 equal sections. What fraction represents 3 pieces of the bar?",
      "student_answer": "The bar is split into 10 equal parts, so each part represents \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of the whole.  \n\nThree of those parts together represent  \n\n\\[\n3 \\times \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{3}{10}.\n\\]\n\n**Answer: \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{3}{10}\\).**"
