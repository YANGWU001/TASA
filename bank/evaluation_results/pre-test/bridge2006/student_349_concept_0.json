      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the first farmer planted more trees.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but it seems like 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f9 (which is 36) is bigger than 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f7 (which is 42), so the first farmer has the larger total."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 15\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 is bigger. Since 15 is a bigger number than 10, multiplying it by 2 should give a larger product than 10\u202f\u00d7\u202f3. So I\u2019d say 15\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 gives the larger product."
