      "student_answer": "To divide a circle into five equal parts you need to create five central angles that each measure the same amount.  \n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step process**\n\n1. **Draw the circle and its centre**  \n   - Mark the centre\u202f\\(O\\) of the circle.\n\n2. **Draw a starting radius**  \n   - From \\(O\\) draw any radius; call the point where it meets the circle \\(A\\).  \n   - This will be the first \u201ccut\u201d (the first dividing line).\n\n3. **Find the size of each central angle**  \n   - A full circle is \\(360^\\circ\\).  \n   - Divide \\(360^\\circ\\) by 5:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{360^\\circ}{5}=72^\\circ .\n     \\]\n   - So each of the five sectors must have a central angle of \\(72^\\circ\\).\n\n4. **Construct the successive radii**  \n   - Using a protractor (or a compass\u2011based construction) measure a \\(72^\\circ\\) angle from the first radius \\(OA\\) around the circle.  \n   - Mark the point where this second radius meets the circle; call it \\(B\\).  \n   - Repeat: from \\(OB\\) measure another \\(72^\\circ\\) to locate point \\(C\\); continue to get points \\(D\\) and \\(E\\).  \n   - After the fifth measurement you will land back at the original point \\(A\\), confirming that you have exactly five equal arcs.\n\n5. **Draw the dividing lines**  \n   - Connect the centre \\(O\\) to each of the points \\(A, B, C, D,\\) and \\(E\\).  \n   - The five radii \\(OA, OB, OC, OD,\\) and \\(OE\\) now split the circle into five congruent sectors.\n\n**Result**  \nEach sector has the same area, bounded by two radii and an arc of \\(72^\\circ\\). The circle is now divided into five equal sections."

      "student_answer": "**Dividing a circle into equal sections**\n\n1. **Understand the whole\u2011circle angle** \u2013 A full circle measures\u202f360\u00b0.  \n2. **Decide how many equal parts you need** \u2013 Let this number be *n*.  \n3. **Find the central angle for each part** \u2013 The central angle is the angle formed at the circle\u2019s centre by two radii that bound one of the sections.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Central angle} = \\frac{360^\\circ}{n}\n   \\]  \n4. **Mark the angles** \u2013 Starting from any reference radius (often the positive\u202fx\u2011axis), use a protractor or a compass\u2011based construction to lay off the central angle repeatedly around the centre. Each successive mark gives the next radius, and the region between consecutive radii is one of the equal sections.  \n5. **Check the work** \u2013 After placing the *n*th radius you should return to the starting line; the sum of all central angles must be 360\u00b0.\n\n---\n\n### Example: 9 equal divisions\n\n- **Number of sections:**\u202f\\(n = 9\\)  \n- **Central angle:**  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{360^\\circ}{9}=40^\\circ\n  \\]\n\nSo each of the nine sections is bounded by two radii that are **40\u00b0 apart**.  \n\n**Procedure**  \n1. Draw a circle and its centre\u202f\\(O\\).  \n2. Draw a reference radius \\(OA\\).  \n3. From \\(O\\), measure a 40\u00b0 angle (using a protractor) to locate the next radius \\(OB\\).  \n4. Continue measuring 40\u00b0 from each new radius: \\(OC, OD,\\dots\\) until you have placed nine radii.  \n5. The sectors \\( \\angle AOB, \\angle BOC, \u2026, \\angle I O A\\) are all equal, each measuring **40\u00b0**.\n\nThus, dividing a circle into 9 equal parts yields an angle of **40 degrees** for each division."
