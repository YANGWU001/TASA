      "question": "What makes a fraction improper?",
      "student_answer": "A fraction is called **improper** when its numerator is **greater than or equal to** its denominator (in absolute value). In other words, if the top number is at least as large as the bottom number, the fraction represents a number that is **\u2265\u202f1** (or \u2264\u202f\u20131 for negative values). This contrasts with a **proper** fraction, where the numerator is strictly smaller than the denominator, so the value lies between \u20131 and\u202f1 (excluding the endpoints)."

      "question": "Why is 11/10 classified as an improper fraction?",
      "student_answer": "\\( \\displaystyle \\frac{11}{10}\\) is called an **improper fraction** because its numerator (11) is larger than its denominator (10). When the top number exceeds the bottom number, the fraction represents a value greater than\u202f1\u2014in this case, \\( \\frac{11}{10}=1.1\\). Fractions whose numerators are less than their denominators are proper fractions, so the opposite condition (numerator\u202f\u2265\u202fdenominator) defines an improper fraction."
