  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of GCF, correctly identifying factors and applying methods to find GCF in various scenarios. However, there was an error in the prime factorization method in Question 3, where the GCF was incorrectly calculated as 12 instead of 12. Overall, the student shows good comprehension and application of the GCF concept.",

      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) of a set of whole numbers is the **largest integer that divides each of the numbers exactly (without leaving a remainder)**.  \n\nIn other words, it is the biggest number that is a factor of every number in the group. For example, the GCF of\u202f12\u202fand\u202f18\u202fis\u202f6, because 6 is a factor of both 12 and 18 and no larger integer has that property.\n\nThe GCF is useful for:\n\n- Simplifying fractions (by dividing numerator and denominator by their GCF).  \n- Reducing ratios to their simplest form.  \n- Solving problems that involve grouping or partitioning objects into equal sized sets.  \n\nSo, the GCF represents the greatest amount that can be \u201ccommon\u201d to all the numbers involved."
