If they match, you have correctly determined the number of equal divisions.\n\n**Result:** Four vertical bars in a rectangular shape divide the rectangle into **five equal vertical sections**."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain why placing 6 vertical bars in a rectangle results in 7 equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "When we draw vertical bars inside a rectangle we are really inserting \u201ccut\u2011lines\u2019\u2019 that separate the rectangle into separate strips.  \n\n*Each bar itself does not form a strip; it is the line that separates two adjacent strips.*  \nSo the total number of strips (or \u201cequal divisions\u2019\u2019) is the number of gaps **between** the bars **plus** the two outermost gaps that lie between the rectangle\u2019s left edge and the first bar, and between the last bar and the rectangle\u2019s right edge.\n\nIf we place **6** vertical bars, the gaps are:\n\n1. Left edge \u2192 first bar  \n2. Bar\u202f1 \u2192 bar\u202f2  \n3. Bar\u202f2 \u2192 bar\u202f3  \n4. Bar\u202f3 \u2192 bar\u202f4  \n5. Bar\u202f4 \u2192 bar\u202f5  \n6. Bar\u202f5 \u2192 bar\u202f6  \n7. Bar\u202f6 \u2192 right edge  \n\nThat is **7** separate regions. Because the bars are drawn at equal spacing, each of those 7 regions has the same width, giving us **7 equal divisions** of the rectangle."

      "question": "How does the number of vertical bars relate to the total number of equal divisions in a given shape?",
      "student_answer": "The vertical bars are the lines that actually **create** the equal parts of the shape.  \nWhen the bars are drawn **inside** the figure (i.e., they are not the outer edges of the shape), each new bar adds one more piece.  \n\n**Rule of thumb**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of equal divisions} \\;=\\; \\text{Number of interior vertical bars} \\;+\\; 1\n\\]\n\n- **Why the \u201c+\u202f1\u201d?**  \n  The first bar separates the shape into two pieces. Adding a second bar splits one of those pieces, giving three pieces, and so on. Thus the count of pieces is always one more than the count of interior bars.\n\n- **If the bars include the outer edges** (for example, a rectangle that is already bounded on the left and right), then the number of divisions is simply the number of bars, because the outer edges are already counted as division boundaries.\n\n**Illustrative examples**\n\n1. **Three interior bars** drawn inside a rectangle \u2192 \\(3 + 1 = 4\\) equal vertical strips.  \n2. **Four bars** that consist of the left edge, three interior bars, and the right edge \u2192 \\(4\\) equal strips (no \u201c+\u202f1\u201d needed because the outer edges are already bars).\n\nSo, in most classroom problems where only the interior vertical lines are counted, you can find the total number of equal divisions by adding one to the number of vertical bars."

      "student_answer": "**Example**\n\n1. **Draw the square** \u2013 Start with a square that is 10\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202fcm.\n\n2. **Mark the spacing** \u2013 Divide the bottom side of the square into 10 equal parts, each 1\u202fcm long.  \n   (Put a small tick at 0\u202fcm, 1\u202fcm, 2\u202fcm \u2026\u202fup to 10\u202fcm.)\n\n3. **Place the vertical bars** \u2013 At each of the nine interior ticks (1\u202fcm, 2\u202fcm, \u2026\u202f9\u202fcm) draw a thin vertical line (a \u201cbar\u201d) from the bottom edge up to the top edge of the square.  \n   - The left\u2011most edge of the square itself counts as the first boundary.  \n   - The right\u2011most edge of the square counts as the final boundary.\n\n4. **Resulting divisions** \u2013 The 10 bars (including the two outer edges) split the square into **11 equal vertical strips**, each 1\u202fcm wide.\n\n```\n| | | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | |\n```\n\n*(The vertical bars are the lines shown; the space between any two adjacent bars is the same width.)*\n\n**Why this works**\n\n- Because the bars are placed at equal 1\u202fcm intervals, every strip between two consecutive bars has the same width (1\u202fcm).  \n- Since the height of the square is unchanged (10\u202fcm), each strip is a smaller rectangle that is **congruent** to every other strip.\n\nThus, by placing 10 equally\u2011spaced vertical bars inside a square, we create **multiple (specifically 11) equal divisions** of that square."
