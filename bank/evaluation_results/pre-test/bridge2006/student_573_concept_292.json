  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the concept of subtracting negative integers, particularly in the real-world example provided. However, most answers contain significant errors in calculations and misunderstandings of the operation. The student needs to review how subtracting a negative integer translates to addition and practice applying this concept correctly.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think subtracting a negative integer is kind of like\u2026 you\u2019re actually taking away something that\u2019s already \u201cless than zero,\u201d so you end up making the whole thing smaller. Like if you have\u202f5\u202f\u2013\u202f(\u20133) and you subtract the \u20133, you\u2019re kind of removing a \u201cnegative amount,\u201d which I guess just makes the number go down a bit more. So I guess\u202f5\u202f\u2013\u202f(\u20133) would be the same as\u202f5\u202f\u2013\u202f3, which would be\u202f2.  \n\nI\u2019m probably mixing things up, but that\u2019s how I understand it."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think one everyday situation is when you\u2019re dealing with a bank account that\u2019s already in the red.  Suppose you owe the bank\u202f$\u201150 (so your balance is \u2013$50).  If a fee of\u202f$\u201120 is applied\u2014that\u2019s like the bank *subtracting* a negative $20 from your balance.  Because subtracting a negative is the same as adding, you can rewrite it as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{balance} = -50 - (-20) = -50 + 20 = -30,\n\\]\n\nso your debt goes from \u2013$50 to \u2013$30.  In other words, \u201csubtracting a negative $20\u201d is just \u201cadding $20.\u201d"
