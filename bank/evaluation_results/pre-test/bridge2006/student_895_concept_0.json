  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of comparing multiplication results, correctly identifying larger products in most cases. However, they made errors in questions 1, 8, and 9 by incorrectly stating equality instead of identifying the larger quantity. This suggests a need for further practice in accurately comparing products.",
