  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a fair understanding of comparing sums, correctly identifying larger quantities in several instances. However, there are some misconceptions, particularly in Questions 1, 6, 7, and 10, where the student incorrectly identifies the larger sum or states that sums are equal when they are not. Continued practice with addition and comparison will help solidify these concepts.",
