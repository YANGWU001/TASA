In fact, \\(a\\) itself divides \\(ka\\) (since \\(ka = a\\cdot k\\)), so \\(a\\) is one of the common divisors. The greatest common factor (GCF) is therefore the largest number that divides both, which is exactly the smaller number \\(a\\).\n\nHence, the GCF of a number and any of its multiples is always the smaller number."

      "student_answer": "When one of the numbers is an exact multiple of the other, the greatest common factor is simply the smaller of the two numbers.\n\n**How to see this without full factorization**\n\n1. **Identify the two numbers** \u2013 call them \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(a<b\\).\n2. **Test whether \\(b\\) is a multiple of \\(a\\).**  \n   - Perform the division \\(b \\div a\\).  \n   - If the remainder is\u202f0, then \\(b = k\\cdot a\\) for some integer \\(k\\).\n3. **Conclusion:**  \n   - Since every divisor of \\(a\\) also divides \\(b\\) (because \\(b\\) is just \\(a\\) multiplied by \\(k\\)), the largest number that divides *both* is \\(a\\) itself.  \n   - Therefore \\(\\text{GCF}(a,b)=a\\).\n\nYou don\u2019t need to list all prime factors of either number; a single division check is enough. If the division does not come out evenly, then the numbers are not in a multiple relationship and you\u2019d use another method (e.g., the Euclidean algorithm) to find the GCF."

Since 7 itself divides both numbers, no larger number can divide 7, so 7 is the greatest possible common factor.\n\nTherefore, the GCF of 7 and 21 is **7**."

      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where finding the GCF of a number and its multiple is useful.",
      "student_answer": "A practical situation where you need the greatest common factor (GCF) of a number and one of its multiples is when you\u2019re **packing items into identical boxes**.\n\n**Scenario:**  \nA school is ordering **120 textbooks** for a class. The textbooks will be placed in boxes, and each box must contain the same number of books. The school also wants each box to hold a **multiple of 15 books** (perhaps because the boxes they already have are sized for 15, 30, 45, etc., books). \n\nTo decide how many boxes to use and how many books should go in each box, you look for the largest number that:\n\n1. Divides the total number of books (120), and  \n2. Is also a multiple of 15.\n\nSince 15 is a factor of 120, the GCF of 120 and its multiple 15\u202f\u00d7\u202fk is simply the largest multiple of 15 that still divides 120. The GCF of 120 and 60 (which is 15\u202f\u00d7\u202f4) is 60. This tells the school they can use **2 boxes**, each holding **60 books**, which satisfies both requirements (the box capacity is a multiple of 15, and all books are packed with none left over).\n\n**Why the GCF matters:**  \nFinding the GCF lets you determine the biggest possible, evenly sized group (the box size) that works for both the total quantity and the required multiple. This minimizes the number of boxes you need while respecting the size constraint, saving on packaging material and handling time."
