      "student_answer": "When one integer is a multiple of another, every factor (divisor) of the smaller number automatically divides the larger one as well.  \n\nLet  \n\n\\[\na \\text{ be the smaller integer},\\qquad  \nb = k\\;a\\;(k\\in\\mathbb Z,\\;k\\ge 1)\n\\]\n\nso \\(b\\) is a multiple of \\(a\\).\n\n1. **Any divisor of \\(a\\) also divides \\(b\\).**  \n   If \\(d\\) divides \\(a\\) then \\(a = d\\;m\\) for some integer \\(m\\).  \n   Substituting into \\(b\\):  \n   \\[\n   b = k\\,a = k\\,(d\\,m) = d\\,(k\\,m),\n   \\]  \n   which shows that \\(d\\) also divides \\(b\\).\n\n2. **All common divisors of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are therefore divisors of \\(a\\).**  \n   Because any number that divides both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must first be a divisor of \\(a\\) (the \u201csmaller\u201d number). Hence the set of common factors of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is exactly the set of factors of \\(a\\).\n\n3. **The greatest of those common factors is \\(a\\) itself.**  \n   Since \\(a\\) divides \\(a\\) (trivially) and \\(a\\) also divides \\(b\\) (by the definition of a multiple), \\(a\\) belongs to the set of common factors. No factor larger than \\(a\\) can be common, because any factor larger than \\(a\\) cannot divide \\(a\\). Therefore the largest common factor is \\(a\\), the smaller number.\n\nHence, the greatest common factor (GCF) of a number and any of its multiples is always the smaller number. \u220e"

      "student_answer": "When one of the numbers is a multiple of the other, the greatest common factor (GCF) is simply the smaller number.  \nYou don\u2019t have to factor both numbers; you only need to verify that the smaller number divides the larger one.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. **Identify the smaller number**  \n   Let the two numbers be \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(a<b\\).\n\n2. **Check divisibility**  \n   Divide the larger number by the smaller: compute \\(b \\div a\\).  \n   - If the remainder is **0**, then \\(a\\) is a factor of \\(b\\) and the GCF is \\(a\\).  \n   - If the remainder is **not 0**, then the numbers are not in a simple \u201cmultiple\u201d relationship and you would need another method (e.g., Euclidean algorithm).\n\n3. **Why this works**  \n   All factors of the larger number \\(b\\) are also factors of the smaller number \\(a\\) when \\(b\\) is a multiple of \\(a\\). Therefore the largest number that divides both is the smaller number itself.\n\n**Example**\n\nFind the GCF of 24 and 72.\n\n- The smaller number is 24.  \n- Divide 72 by 24: \\(72 \u00f7 24 = 3\\) with remainder 0.  \n\nSince 24 divides 72 exactly, the GCF is **24**.\n\n**Alternate quick check (Euclidean algorithm)**  \n\nYou can also apply one step of the Euclidean algorithm:  \n\\( \\gcd(72,24) = \\gcd(24, 72 \\bmod 24) = \\gcd(24,0) = 24.\\)\n\nBoth approaches give the same result without fully factoring either number."

This means the batch can be divided into:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{240}{40}=6 \\text{ boxes}\n\\]\n\n**Why the GCF is useful here**\n\n- It tells the business the **largest uniform group size** (or box size) that works for both numbers, preventing partially filled boxes or leftover candles.  \n- Using the GCF maximizes efficiency: fewer boxes are needed, shipping costs are reduced, and packaging time is minimized.  \n\nIn any situation where you need to split a quantity into equal groups that also fit a pre\u2011existing container size\u2014such as arranging chairs in rows, loading pallets onto trucks, or dividing ingredients for recipes\u2014the GCF of a number and its multiple gives the optimal, waste\u2011free grouping."
