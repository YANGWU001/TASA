      "question": "If a vertical bar is divided into 4 equal parts, what fraction represents one piece of the bar?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{4}\\)\n\n**Explanation:**  \nWhen a vertical bar is split into 4 equal pieces, each piece is one\u2011fourth of the whole bar. Hence the fraction that represents one piece is \\(1 \\div 4 = \\frac{1}{4}\\)."

      "question": "A vertical bar is split into 5 equal sections. What fraction of the bar does each section represent?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the 5 equal sections represents  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\nof the whole vertical bar."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "A vertical bar is divided into 6 parts. How would you express the fraction of 2 pieces combined?",
      "student_answer": "The two combined pieces make  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{6}\n\\]\n\nwhich simplifies by dividing numerator and denominator by\u202f2:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{6}= \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\nSo the fraction of the bar represented by those two pieces is \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{3}\\)."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If a vertical bar is divided into 3 equal parts, which fraction represents 2 of those parts?",
      "student_answer": "The fraction is \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{2}{3}\\).  Since the bar is split into three equal pieces, taking two of those pieces covers two\u2011thirds of the whole."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How many pieces would a vertical bar be divided into if each piece represents 1/8 of the bar?",
      "student_answer": "The bar would be divided into **8 pieces** \u2013 each piece makes up \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) of the whole."

      "question": "A vertical bar is divided into 10 equal sections. What fraction represents 3 pieces of the bar?",
      "student_answer": "The bar is split into 10 equal parts, so each part represents \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\) of the whole.  \nThree of those parts together represent:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{3}{10}\n\\]\n\n**Answer: \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{3}{10}\\)**."
