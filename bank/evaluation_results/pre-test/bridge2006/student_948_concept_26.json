      "student_answer": "**Answer:** The greatest common factor (GCF) of 12 and 16 is **4**.\n\n**Explanation:**  \n- Prime factorization of 12 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3.  \n- Prime factorization of 16 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2.  \n- The common prime factors are two 2\u2019s, giving \\(2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 = 4\\).  \nThus, the largest number that divides both 12 and 16 without a remainder is 4."

      "question": "Explain what the greatest common factor (GCF) represents in mathematics.",
      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (often called the greatest common divisor or GCF) of two or more integers is the **largest positive integer that divides each of the numbers exactly** (i.e., without leaving a remainder).  \n\nIn other words, if you list all the factors (positive divisors) of each number, the GCF is the highest number that appears in every list. It tells you the biggest \u201cpiece\u201d that can be taken out of each quantity without breaking it into fractions.\n\n**Why it matters**\n\n- **Simplifying fractions:** Dividing the numerator and denominator by their GCF reduces a fraction to lowest terms.  \n- **Factoring and solving equations:** The GCF can be factored out of algebraic expressions to simplify them or to find common solutions.  \n- **Number\u2011theory problems:** It helps identify relationships such as whether numbers are relatively prime (GCF\u202f=\u202f1) or share common multiples.\n\n**Example**\n\nFor the numbers 24 and\u202f36:\n\n- Factors of 24: 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f12,\u202f24  \n- Factors of 36: 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f12,\u202f18,\u202f36  \n\nThe common factors are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f12. The greatest among them is **12**, so \\(\\text{GCF}(24,36)=12\\).\n\nThus, the GCF represents the biggest whole number that can be used to evenly \u201cshare\u201d each of the given numbers."
