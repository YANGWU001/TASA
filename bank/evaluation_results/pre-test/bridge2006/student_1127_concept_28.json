Divide: \\(84 \u00f7 15 = 5.6\\) \u2192 not an integer.  \n2. Compute remainder: \\(84 \\bmod 15 = 9\\) (since \\(15 \\times 5 = 75\\) and \\(84-75=9\\)).  \n   The remainder is not zero, so **15 is not a factor of 84**.\n\n(Using the rule for 3: the sum of the digits of 84 is \\(8+4 = 12\\), which is divisible by 3, but 84 is not divisible by 5, so it can\u2019t be divisible by 15 = 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5.)\n\n---\n\n**In summary:** To determine if \\(d\\) is a factor of \\(N\\), check that the division \\(N \u00f7 d\\) leaves a remainder of zero (or use appropriate divisibility rules or prime\u2011factor comparison). If the remainder is zero, \\(d\\) is a factor; otherwise it is not."

      "student_answer": "### Using Divisibility Rules to List Factors Efficiently  \n\nWhen a number is too large to test every integer up to it, the classic **divisibility rules** let you cut the work down dramatically. Below is a step\u2011by\u2011step strategy that most students use to generate a complete factor list without exhaustive trial\u2011and\u2011error.\n\n---\n\n#### 1.\u202fQuickly Identify the \u201cobvious\u201d small factors  \n\n| Rule | How to apply | Typical result |\n|------|--------------|----------------|\n| **2** | Does the last digit end in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8? | All even numbers are divisible by\u202f2. |\n| **3** | Sum the digits; is the sum a multiple of\u202f3? | If yes, the whole number is divisible by\u202f3. |\n| **4** | Look at the last two digits; are they a multiple of\u202f4? | Gives a factor\u202f4 (or\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2). |\n| **5** | Does the number end in 0 or\u202f5? | Divisible by\u202f5. |\n| **6** | Must satisfy both the rules for\u202f2\u202fand\u202f3. | Gives a factor\u202f6. |\n| **8** | Last three digits form a multiple of\u202f8. | Gives a factor\u202f8. |\n| **9** | Sum of digits is a multiple of\u202f9. | Gives a factor\u202f9. |\n| **10**| Ends in\u202f0. | Gives a factor\u202f10. |\n\nApply each rule once; every rule that checks out supplies a **small factor** and, by symmetry, also a **large co\u2011factor** (the quotient after division). Write both down as a pair.\n\n*Example*:  \nNumber\u202f=\u202f\u202f**12\u202f960**  \n- Ends in\u202f0 \u2192 factor\u202f10; co\u2011factor\u202f1\u202f296.  \n- Digit sum\u202f=\u202f1+2+9+6+0\u202f=\u202f18 \u2192 factor\u202f3; co\u2011factor\u202f4\u202f320.  \n\n---\n\n#### 2.\u202fUse the small factors to build **prime\u2011factor candidates**  \n\nA number\u2019s complete factor set is derived from its prime factorisation. Once you have a few small prime factors (2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11 \u2026) you can keep dividing the original number (or the current co\u2011factor) by those primes:\n\n1. **Divide out the factor** you have just confirmed.  \n2. **Repeat the divisibility test** on the new quotient.  \n\nContinue until the quotient itself is prime (or 1).  \n\n*Continuing the example* (12\u202f960):  \n\n- 12\u202f960 \u00f7 10 = 1\u202f296 \u2192 still even \u2192 1\u202f296 \u00f7 2 = 648 \u2192 \u00f72 = 324 \u2192 \u00f72 = 162 \u2192 \u00f72 =\u202f81.  \n- 81 is 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3, so we have three more 3\u2019s.  \n\nPrime factorisation: **12\u202f960 = 2\u2075\u202f\u00b7\u202f3\u00b3\u202f\u00b7\u202f5**.\n\n---\n\n#### 3.\u202fGenerate **all factor combinations** from the prime list  \n\nIf  \n\n\\[\nN = p_1^{a_1}\\; p_2^{a_2}\\; \\dots\\; p_k^{a_k},\n\\]\n\nevery factor is of the form  \n\n\\[\np_1^{b_1}\\; p_2^{b_2}\\; \\dots\\; p_k^{b_k},\n\\]\n\nwhere each exponent \\(b_i\\) can be any integer from\u202f0\u202fto\u202f\\(a_i\\).  \n\nThe total number of factors is  \n\n\\[\n(a_1+1)(a_2+1)\\dots(a_k+1).\n\\]\n\nEnumerate all exponent choices (often by a short table or a simple computer script) to list every factor.\n\n*For 12\u202f960*:  \n\n- Exponents for 2: 0\u20115  \n- Exponents for 3: 0\u20113  \n- Exponent for 5: 0\u20111  \n\nTotal factors = (5+1)(3+1)(1+1) = **48**.  \nListing them (by increasing size) gives:  \n\n1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f5,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f9,\u202f10,\u202f12,\u202f15,\u202f16,\u202f18,\u202f20,\u202f24,\u202f27,\u202f30,\u202f32,\u202f36,\u202f40,\u202f45,\u202f48,\u202f54,\u202f60,\u202f64,\u202f72,\u202f80,\u202f81,\u202f90,\u202f96,\u202f108,\u202f120,\u202f135,\u202f144,\u202f160,\u202f162,\u202f180,\u202f192,\u202f216,\u202f240,\u202f270,\u202f288,\u202f324,\u202f360,\u202f384,\u202f405,\u202f432,\u202f480,\u202f540,\u202f576,\u202f720,\u202f960,\u202f1\u202f080,\u202f1\u202f440,\u202f1\u202f920,\u202f2\u202f880,\u202f3\u202f840,\u202f5\u202f760,\u202f7\u202f680,\u202f12\u202f960.\n\n---\n\n#### 4.\u202fShortcut: **Stop at \u221aN**  \n\nWhen you are only interested in **pairs of factors**, you never need to test divisors larger than \\(\\sqrt{N}\\). Every factor greater than \\(\\sqrt{N}\\) pairs with a smaller one that you have already found.\n\n- Compute \\(\\sqrt{N}\\) (or estimate it).  \n- Apply the divisibility rules only up to that bound.  \n\nFor 12\u202f960, \\(\\sqrt{12\u202f960}\\approx 113.8\\). So checking divisibility by primes up to 113 (2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11\u2026) is enough; any factor you miss beyond that automatically appears as the complement of a smaller factor you already recorded.\n\n---\n\n#### 5.\u202fPutting it all together \u2013 a quick checklist  \n\n1. **Apply the simple digit\u2011based rules** (2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f5,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f9,\u202f10) to snag the easy factors.  \n2. **Divide them out** and keep testing the reduced quotient with the same rules.  \n3. **Identify all prime factors** (including 7,\u202f11,\u202f13\u2026) using the same \u201ctest\u2011and\u2011divide\u201d loop, stopping at \\(\\sqrt{\\text{current quotient}}\\).  \n4. **Write the prime\u2011exponent list**; compute the total number of factors.  \n5. **Enumerate exponent combinations** to list every factor, or stop at \\(\\sqrt{N}\\) if you only need factor pairs.  \n\n---\n\n### Why this works  \n\n- **Divisibility rules** are essentially *quick modular tests* that avoid long division.  \n- By **removing** each confirmed factor immediately, the number you work with shrinks rapidly, making later tests even faster.  \n- The **prime\u2011exponent method** guarantees *completeness*: you never miss a factor because every divisor is built from the same primes.  \n- **Stopping at \\(\\sqrt{N}\\)** halves the work, because factors come in complementary pairs.\n\nUsing these steps, even a number with dozens of digits can be factored systematically without brute\u2011force trial division."
