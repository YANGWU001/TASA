      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Both products are the same size.\n\n- \\(5 \\times 8 = 40\\)  \n- \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\)\n\nSince each multiplication equals 40, neither is larger; they are equal."

      "student_answer": "\\(7 \\times 6 = 42\\)\n\n\\(8 \\times 5 = 40\\)\n\nSince \\(42 > 40\\), multiplying 7 by 6 gives a larger result than multiplying 8 by 5."

      "student_answer": "The product \\(3 \\times 9 = 27\\) and the product \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\).  \n\nSince \\(27 > 24\\), the larger product is **\\(3 \\times 9\\) (which equals 27).**"

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, \\(10 \\times 3\\) is larger than \\(7 \\times 4\\).\n\n**Explanation:**  \n- \\(10 \\times 3 = 30\\)  \n- \\(7 \\times 4 = 28\\)  \n\nSince \\(30 > 28\\), the product of \\(10\\) and \\(3\\) is the larger quantity."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If you multiply 12 by 4 and 9 by 5, which result is greater?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Multiplying 12 by 4 gives \\(12\\times4 = 48\\).  \nMultiplying 9 by 5 gives \\(9\\times5 = 45\\).\n\nSince \\(48 > 45\\), the product **48** (from \\(12 \\times 4\\)) is the greater result."
