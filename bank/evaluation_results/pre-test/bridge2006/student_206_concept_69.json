      "question": "If a rectangle\u2019s length is multiplied by 3, what is the new length if the original length was 5?",

      "student_answer": "The length is multiplied by **4**."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "The width of a rectangle is tripled. What does the multiplier represent in this case?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier is **3**.  \nIt tells us that the new width is three times the original width \u2013 the rectangle\u2019s width is being multiplied by a factor of three."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If the dimensions of a rectangle are multiplied by 2, what happens to the area of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "When both the length and the width of a rectangle are multiplied by 2, each dimension is doubled.  \nSince the area of a rectangle is **length\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth**, the new area becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{new area}= (2\\cdot\\text{length})\\times(2\\cdot\\text{width}) = 4 \\times (\\text{length}\\times\\text{width})\n\\]\n\nSo the area is multiplied by **4** \u2013 it becomes four times larger than the original area."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A rectangle has a width of 6 meters. The width is multiplied by a factor of 5. What is the new width?",
      "student_answer": "The new width is  \n\n\\[\n6\\text{\u202fm} \\times 5 = 30\\text{\u202fm}.\n\\]"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the multiplier used if a rectangle\u2019s width is reduced to half its original size?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier is **0.5** (since the width is reduced to one\u2011half of its original value)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is multiplied by 7, how does the multiplier affect the perimeter of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "The original perimeter of a rectangle is  \n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{old}} = 2L + 2W .\n\\]\n\nIf only the length \\(L\\) is multiplied by 7 (the width \\(W\\) stays the same), the new perimeter becomes  \n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{new}} = 2(7L) + 2W = 14L + 2W .\n\\]\n\nSo the \u201clength part\u2019\u2019 of the perimeter is multiplied by 7, while the width part is unchanged. In other words, the perimeter increases from \\(2L+2W\\) to \\(14L+2W\\); the contribution from the length is seven\u2011times larger, but the overall perimeter is **not** simply multiplied by 7 unless the width is also multiplied by 7."
