      "question": "Explain the steps involved in calculating the total of a group of numbers.",
      "student_answer": "Sure, here\u2019s one way to think about adding up a set of numbers:\n\n1. **List the numbers** \u2013 Write out each value you want to include, either on paper or in a spreadsheet.  \n2. **Arrange them (optional)** \u2013 It can help to line the numbers up by place value (units, tens, hundreds, etc.) so you don\u2019t miss any digits.  \n3. **Start adding** \u2013 Begin with the first two numbers and find their sum.  \n4. **Add the next number to the running total** \u2013 Take the result from step\u202f3 and add the third number, then keep going until you\u2019ve added every number in the list.  \n5. **Check your work** \u2013 You can either add the numbers again in a different order (or use a calculator) to make sure the total is the same.\n\nI think that\u2019s basically it. If you wanted to be extra careful, you could also **double\u2011check the place\u2011value alignment** before you start, especially if the numbers have different numbers of digits. (Some people also group numbers into tens or hundreds first, but that\u2019s just a shortcut.)"

      "student_answer": "You can add the numbers together:  \n\n\\(5 + 10 + 20 = 35\\).  \n\nSo the total of 5, 10, and 20 is **35**.   (I think this is the right answer.)"

      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where calculating the total is necessary.",
      "student_answer": "I think one everyday example is when a small shop owner wants to know how much money they made in a day.  \nThey would look at each product they sold, take the price of that product, and then **add** those prices together to get the day\u2019s total revenue.  \n\n(So the total is calculated by summing the price of every item sold.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How does rounding individual numbers affect the accuracy of calculating their total?",
      "student_answer": "Rounding the individual numbers before you add them can change the final total, because each rounding introduces a small \u201cround\u2011off\u201d error.  \nWhen you sum the rounded values, those little errors tend to add together, so the overall total can be off by roughly the sum of the individual rounding errors (in the worst case, about\u202f\u00bd\u202fof the rounding unit for each number).  \n\nBecause of that, it\u2019s usually more accurate to keep the original, un\u2011rounded values while you\u2019re adding and only round the final sum. In most everyday situations the effect is small \u2013 if the numbers are much larger than the rounding unit, the extra error is often negligible \u2013 but with many terms or with very small numbers the accumulated rounding error can become noticeable.  \n\n(That said, in some cases the rounding errors can partially cancel each other out, so the total isn\u2019t always dramatically worse; it just isn\u2019t as reliably accurate as when you round only at the end.)"

    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "What is the difference between calculating total and calculating average in a dataset?",
      "student_answer": "The total of a data set is simply the **sum of all the values** in that set.  \nThe average (or mean) takes that same sum and **divides it by the number of observations** in the data set, giving a \u201ctypical\u201d value.\n\nSo, in short:\n\n* **Total**\u202f=\u202f\\(x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_n\\) \u2013 it tells you the overall magnitude of the data.  \n* **Average**\u202f=\u202f\\(\\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_n}{n}\\) \u2013 it tells you the central tendency, i.e., a typical value you would expect.\n\n(Occasionally people talk about the \u201caverage\u201d as the middle value of the data, but that\u2019s actually the **median**, not the mean.)"
