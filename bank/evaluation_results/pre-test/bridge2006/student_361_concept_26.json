However, there was a mistake in Question 4 regarding the GCF of 18, 27, and 45, where the student incorrectly stated the GCF as 9 instead of 9.

      "question": "Explain what the greatest common factor (GCF) represents in mathematics.",
      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF), also called the greatest common divisor (GCD), is **the largest positive integer that divides each of a given set of integers without leaving a remainder**.  \n\nIn other words, if you have two (or more) whole numbers, the GCF is the biggest number that is a factor of every one of them. For example, the numbers 24 and\u202f36 share the factors 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f12, and\u202f24; the greatest of these is 12, so\u202fGCF(24,\u202f36)\u202f=\u202f12.\n\n**Why it matters**\n\n- **Simplifying fractions:** Dividing the numerator and denominator by their GCF reduces a fraction to its lowest terms.  \n- **Factoring and algebra:** The GCF can be factored out of polynomials or expressions to simplify them or to solve equations.  \n- **Problem solving:** Many word\u2011problems involving grouping, sharing, or tiling rely on finding the GCF to determine the largest possible equal-sized groups.  \n\nThus, the GCF tells us the biggest \u201ccommon building block\u201d that two or more numbers share, enabling us to work with those numbers in a more reduced and manageable form."
