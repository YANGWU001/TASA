      "student_answer": "**How to find the number of equal parts created by\u202f4 vertical bars in a rectangle**\n\n1. **Start with the whole shape** \u2013 Draw (or picture) the rectangle you want to divide.\n\n2. **Count the bars** \u2013 In this case you have **4 vertical bars**.  \n   Remember that the bars are the *dividers*; the spaces **between** the bars and the outer edges are also parts.\n\n3. **Add one to the number of bars** \u2013 The number of equal sections is  \n   \\[\n   \\text{sections} = \\text{bars} + 1.\n   \\]  \n   So with 4 bars you will get **5 equal divisions**.\n\n4. **Determine the width of each division** \u2013 Measure the total width of the rectangle (call it\u202f\\(W\\)).  \n   The width of each equal piece is  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{W}{5}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Mark the division points** \u2013 Starting at the left\u2011hand edge, place a tick mark at every \\(\\frac{W}{5}\\) interval:  \n   - First mark at \\(\\frac{W}{5}\\) (this is where the first vertical bar goes)  \n   - Second mark at \\(\\frac{2W}{5}\\) (second bar)  \n   - Third at \\(\\frac{3W}{5}\\) (third bar)  \n   - Fourth at \\(\\frac{4W}{5}\\) (fourth bar)  \n\n6. **Draw the vertical bars** \u2013 Draw a straight vertical line through each of the four marks, extending from the top edge to the bottom edge of the rectangle.\n\n7. **Check the result** \u2013 You should now see five strips of equal width:  \n   - left of the first bar,  \n   - between bar\u202f1 & bar\u202f2,  \n   - between bar\u202f2 & bar\u202f3,  \n   - between bar\u202f3 & bar\u202f4,  \n   - right of the fourth bar.\n\nThat\u2019s the complete process: **four vertical bars divide a rectangle into five equal vertical sections**."

      "question": "If a rectangle is divided by 5 evenly spaced vertical bars, how many equal sections are formed?",

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain why placing 6 vertical bars in a rectangle results in 7 equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "When we draw vertical bars inside a rectangle, each bar separates one region from the next.  \nThe rectangle already has two \u201cborder\u201d edges \u2013 the left side and the right side \u2013 that act as the first and last boundaries of the divisions.  \n\nIf we place **n** vertical bars, they create **n\u202f+\u202f1** distinct strips:\n\n* The space from the left edge of the rectangle to the first bar is the first strip.  \n* Between each pair of consecutive bars there is one strip.  \n* The space from the last bar to the right edge of the rectangle is the final strip.\n\nBecause the bars are drawn **equally spaced**, each of those strips has the same width.  \n\nTherefore, when we put **6** vertical bars in the rectangle, the number of strips (equal divisions) is  \n\n\\[\n6\\text{ bars} \\;+\\; 1\\text{ (the left\u2011most region)} \\;=\\; 7\\text{ equal divisions}.\n\\]\n\nSo the rectangle is divided into seven equal vertical sections."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How does the number of vertical bars relate to the total number of equal divisions in a given shape?",
      "student_answer": "The vertical bars act as **separators** that split the shape into equal parts.  \n- When there are **no** bars, the shape is just one whole piece (\u202f1 division).  \n- Adding the first bar cuts the shape into two equal pieces.  \n- Adding a second bar cuts it into three equal pieces, and so on.\n\nTherefore, the relationship is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of equal divisions} = \\text{Number of vertical bars} + 1\n\\]\n\nIn other words, each additional vertical bar creates one more equal division beyond the original whole shape. (If the bars themselves are counted as the divisions, then the count would be the same as the number of bars, but in the usual \u201cseparator\u201d interpretation the formula above applies.)"

      "student_answer": "To split a rectangle into\u202f8 equal vertical sections, you need a line between each pair of adjacent sections.  \nNumber of bars\u202f=\u202f(number of parts)\u202f\u2013\u202f1\u202f=\u202f8\u202f\u2013\u202f1\u202f=\u202f**7** vertical bars."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Illustrate with an example how placing 10 vertical bars in a square creates multiple equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided only by **vertical bars**, each bar creates a line that separates one part of the square from the next.  \nIf we draw **10 equally\u2011spaced vertical bars** inside the square, the square is split into **10 narrow vertical strips that are all the same size**.\n\n**Example**\n\n1. **Start with a square that is 10\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202fcm.**  \n2. **Draw 10 vertical bars** inside the square, each one 1\u202fcm apart from the next (including the two outer edges of the square).  \n   - The first bar is placed 1\u202fcm from the left edge, the second bar 2\u202fcm from the left edge, \u2026, the tenth bar 10\u202fcm from the left edge (the right edge of the square).  \n3. **Result:** the square is now divided into 10 vertical rectangles, each measuring 1\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202fcm.  \n\nBecause the bars are equally spaced, every one of those 10 rectangles has exactly the same area (10\u202fcm\u00b2) and the same width (1\u202fcm). Thus the 10 vertical bars have created **multiple equal divisions** of the original square."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If a student places 12 vertical bars on a rectangle, what formula can be used to calculate the number of equal divisions formed?",
      "student_answer": "The number of equal vertical divisions created by drawing\u202f\\(n\\)\u202fvertical bars on a rectangle is one more than the number of bars, because each bar adds a new slice.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Divisions} = n + 1}\n\\]\n\nSo for 12 vertical bars the rectangle would be divided into \\(12 + 1 = 13\\) equal sections."
