  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of GCF, particularly in cases where one number is a multiple of the other. Most answers are correct, but the listing of factors method for question 6 was incorrect, as 25 is not a common factor of 25 and 100. Overall, the student shows good reasoning and explanation skills.",

      "student_answer": "If one of the numbers is an exact multiple of the other, the greatest common factor is simply the smaller of the two numbers.\n\n**Why this works**\n\nLet the two numbers be \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(b = k\\;a\\) for some integer \\(k\\).\n\n* Every factor of \\(a\\) also divides \\(b\\) (because \\(b\\) is just \\(a\\) repeated \\(k\\) times).\n* Therefore the set of common factors of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is exactly the set of factors of \\(a\\).\n* The *greatest* of those common factors is just \\(a\\) itself.\n\nSo you don\u2019t need to factor either number completely. All you have to do is:\n\n1. Identify which number is the smaller (or which one divides the other).\n2. Verify that the larger number is indeed a multiple of the smaller (divide them; the remainder should be\u202f0).\n3. Conclude that the GCF is the smaller number.\n\n**Quick check with the Euclidean algorithm**\n\nIf you want to be extra sure, you can run one step of the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(a,\\,b \\bmod a)\n\\]\n\nSince \\(b\\) is a multiple of \\(a\\), \\(b \\bmod a = 0\\). Thus\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(a,0) = a.\n\\]\n\nEither way, you avoid the need to factor both numbers fully."

      "student_answer": "A practical situation where you would look for the greatest common factor (GCF) of a number and one of its multiples is when you\u2019re trying to **package items into the largest identical groups without leftovers**.\n\n**Scenario \u2013 Packing snack bags**\n\nImagine a school cafeteria that has\u202f48\u202fcookies and wants to put them into snack bags so that each bag gets the same number of cookies and no cookies are left over. The cafeteria knows that the total number of cookies (48) is a multiple of the number of cookies they could put in each bag. To decide the biggest possible bag size that still uses all the cookies, they find the GCF of 48\u202fand one of its multiples, say\u202f96\u202f(the next larger multiple that might represent the total if they added another batch).\n\n1. List the factors of 48:\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f12,\u202f16,\u202f24,\u202f48.  \n2. List the factors of 96:\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f12,\u202f16,\u202f24,\u202f32,\u202f48,\u202f96.  \n3. The greatest factor they share is **48**.\n\nBecause the GCF is 48, the largest size of each snack bag that will use every cookie without any leftovers is **48 cookies per bag**\u2014in other words, they could just put all 48 cookies in a single bag.  \n\nIf the cafeteria wanted more than one bag, they could look at the next\u2011largest common factor (which would be 24, 16, 12, etc.) to decide on a different bag size. The process of finding the GCF helps them quickly determine the biggest possible equal\u2011sized groups (or the smallest number of groups) that fit the total amount.  \n\nThis same reasoning is used in many real\u2011life contexts, such as cutting fabric into equal strips, arranging seating in rows, or scheduling recurring events when the total number of days is a multiple of the interval. The GCF tells you the largest size of each group (or the smallest number of groups) that works perfectly with the given total."
