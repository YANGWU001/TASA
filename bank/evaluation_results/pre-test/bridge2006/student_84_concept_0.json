  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of comparing products through multiplication. Most answers are correct, but there were two errors: in Question 1, the student incorrectly stated that the two products were equal, and in Question 9, the student also incorrectly claimed that the products were the same. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the concept.",
