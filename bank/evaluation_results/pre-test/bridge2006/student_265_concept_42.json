  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of equal divisions in horizontal bars, correctly identifying the number of divisions in most cases. However, there were minor errors in questions 3 and 9, where the focus was on fractions rather than the number of divisions. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the topic.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "How many equal divisions are there in a horizontal bar divided into 4 sections?",
      "student_answer": "The horizontal bar is divided into **4 equal sections**, so there are **4 equal divisions**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a horizontal bar is divided into 8 equal parts, how many divisions does it have?",
      "student_answer": "The bar has **8 divisions**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "A horizontal bar is divided into 5 equal sections. What fraction of the bar does one section represent?",
      "student_answer": "One section represents \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{5}\\) of the horizontal bar."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What is the total number of equal divisions in a horizontal bar divided into thirds?",
      "student_answer": "The bar is split into three equal parts, so there are **3** divisions."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If a horizontal bar is divided into 10 equal parts, how much of the bar does each section represent as a fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the 10 equal sections represents \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{10}\\) of the horizontal bar."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A horizontal bar is divided into equal sections of 1/6 each. How many divisions does the bar have?",
      "student_answer": "The bar is split into sections each representing \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) of the whole.  \nNumber of equal divisions\u202f=\u202f\\( \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{6}} = 6 \\).\n\n**Answer: 6 divisions**."
