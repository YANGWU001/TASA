  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of LCM concepts, particularly in identifying when one number is a multiple of another. However, there are significant misunderstandings in calculating specific LCMs and in explaining the concept clearly.

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why the LCM of 5 and 20 is 20.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the least common multiple of\u202f5\u202fand\u202f20\u202fis\u202f20 is because\u202f20\u202fis already a multiple of\u202f5.  \nWhen we look for a common multiple, we need a number that both\u202f5\u202fand\u202f20\u202fcan divide into without a remainder. Since\u202f5\u202fgoes into\u202f20\u202fexactly\u202f4\u202ftimes,\u202f20\u202fitself works for both numbers.  \n\nAnd because we\u2019re looking for the *least* such number, we check if there\u2019s anything smaller than\u202f20\u202fthat both divide into. The only smaller multiples of\u202f5\u202fare\u202f5,\u202f10,\u202f15, but none of those are multiples of\u202f20. So the smallest common multiple is just the bigger number,\u202f20.  \n\nSo, yeah, the LCM is\u202f20\u202fbecause\u202f20\u202fis a multiple of\u202f5\u202fand there\u2019s no smaller number that works for both. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of 8 and 24 is **16**.  \n\nMy reasoning is that the LCM has to be a number that both 8 and 24 can divide into without a remainder. Since 8 goes into 16 exactly two times, 16 is a multiple of 8. I also thought that 24 might go into 16\u2026 well, actually 24 doesn\u2019t go into 16, but I guessed that maybe there\u2019s a smaller common multiple than 24, and 16 seemed to work for 8, so I guessed 16 as the least common multiple.  \n\n(I'm not completely sure\u2014I might have mixed up the steps.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s **True**.  \n\nIf one number (say\u202f\\(b\\)) is a multiple of the other number (\\(a\\)), then \\(b = k\\cdot a\\) for some integer \\(k\\).  \nBecause \\(b\\) already contains every factor of \\(a\\), the smallest number that both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) divide into is just \\(b\\) itself. So the least common multiple of the two numbers is the larger one.  \n\n(So the statement is true.)"

      "question": "Identify the LCM of 12 and 36 and explain the steps you used to find it.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of 12 and 36 is **48**.\n\n**Steps I tried to use (though I\u2019m not totally sure I did it right):**\n\n1. I listed a few multiples of each number.  \n   - Multiples of 12: 12, 24, **36**, **48**, 60 \u2026  \n   - Multiples of 36: 36, **72**, 108 \u2026  \n\n2. I looked for a number that appears in both lists. I saw 36 in the first list, but then I thought maybe I needed to go a little higher to be safe, so I kept going.\n\n3. After 36, the next multiple of 12 is 48, and I guessed that 48 might also be a multiple of 36 because 36\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.33 is about 48. I know that\u2019s not a whole multiple, but I thought maybe I was missing something.\n\n4. Since 48 seemed to show up in the 12\u2011list and felt \u201cbig enough,\u201d I just picked 48 as the LCM.\n\nI\u2019m not really confident about this \u2013 I might have mixed up the idea of a common multiple versus the least common multiple. If it\u2019s wrong, I guess the real LCM could be 36, but that\u2019s what I got stuck on."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the student\u2019s answer might actually be okay. The LCM is the *smallest* number that both numbers can go into, right? Since 7 goes into 7 exactly once and 21 goes into 7 \u2026 well, actually 21 is a multiple of 7, so maybe 7 counts as a common multiple of both of them. If that\u2019s the case, then the least common multiple would just be 7. I\u2019m not completely sure, but it seems like 7 could work as the LCM of 7 and 21."

Maybe because 45\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f15, you\u2019d do 15\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f75? I\u2019m not confident about this\u2026"
