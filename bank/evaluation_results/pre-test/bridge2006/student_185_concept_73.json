      "question": "How would you divide a number line to represent fractions with a denominator of 10?",
      "student_answer": "To show fractions that have a denominator of\u202f10 on a number line, you break the segment between two whole\u2011number points into ten equal parts.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. **Draw the basics** \u2013 Sketch a horizontal line and mark the two whole numbers that will bound the segment you\u2019re working with (e.g., 0 and 1).\n\n2. **Divide the interval into 10 equal pieces** \u2013  \n   *Count off* ten evenly spaced tick marks between the two endpoints.  \n   You can do this by measuring the total length and dividing it by\u202f10, or simply by \u201ceye\u2011spacing\u2019\u2019 ten marks that look equally spaced.\n\n3. **Label the marks** \u2013 Starting at the left\u2011hand endpoint, label the first tick\u202f\\( \\frac{1}{10}\\) (or 0.1), the next\u202f\\( \\frac{2}{10}\\) (or 0.2), and continue up to the right\u2011hand endpoint, which is \\( \\frac{10}{10}=1\\).\n\n4. **Check the spacing** \u2013 Each successive mark should be the same distance from the previous one; this confirms that the line is truly divided into ten equal parts.\n\n**Result**\n\nYou now have a number line where each tick represents one\u2011tenth of a whole, so any fraction with denominator\u202f10 (e.g., \\( \\frac{3}{10}, \\frac{7}{10}\\), etc.) can be read directly from the appropriate tick mark."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain how the denominator of a fraction affects the number of divisions on a number line.",
      "student_answer": "The denominator tells us how many equal parts each whole unit on the number line is split into.\n\n- If the denominator is **2**, each unit (1\u202f\u2013\u202f0) is divided into 2 equal segments, so the points that can be marked are 0,\u202f\u00bd,\u202f1,\u202f1\u00bd,\u202f2, etc.\n- If the denominator is **5**, each unit is divided into 5 equal segments, giving points at 0,\u202f\u2155,\u202f\u2156,\u202f\u2157,\u202f\u2158,\u202f1,\u202f1\u2155, \u2026.\n- In general, a fraction with denominator\u202f*d* places marks at every 1\u2044*d* of a unit. Thus the larger the denominator, the finer the division of the number line and the smaller the distance between adjacent points.\n\nSo the denominator controls the **number of equal divisions** within each whole interval: a bigger denominator \u2192 more divisions \u2192 a more detailed (more finely spaced) number line; a smaller denominator \u2192 fewer divisions \u2192 coarser spacing."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Describe the relationship between the denominator of a fraction and the number of equal divisions on the number line.",
      "student_answer": "The denominator tells you how many equal pieces the whole (usually the segment from\u202f0\u202fto\u202f1\u202fon a number line) is broken into.  \n\n- If the denominator is\u202f4, the unit interval is divided into\u202f4\u202fequal parts; each tick mark is\u202f\u00bc\u202fapart.  \n- If the denominator is\u202f7, the interval is split into\u202f7\u202fequal sections; each step represents\u202f1\u20447.  \n\nIn other words, the number of equal divisions you draw between\u202f0\u202fand\u202f1\u202fis exactly the value of the denominator. Any fraction that has that denominator will land on one of those division points (e.g., 3\u20444 is the third tick when the denominator is\u202f4)."

      "question": "How could you divide a number line to represent fractions with denominators of both 2 and 4?",
      "student_answer": "To show both\u202f\u00bd\u2011segments **and**\u202f\u00bc\u2011segments on the same line you start with the usual 0\u2011to\u20111 number line and then follow these steps:\n\n1. **Mark the endpoints** \u2013 put a point at\u202f0\u202fand a point at\u202f1.\n\n2. **Divide the whole unit into 2 equal parts** (denominator\u202f2).  \n   - Put a mark exactly halfway between 0 and 1.  \n   - That point is\u202f\u00bd.\n\n3. **Divide the whole unit into 4 equal parts** (denominator\u202f4).  \n   - To get quarters, split each of the two halves you just made into two equal pieces.  \n   - The new marks are at\u202f\u00bc,\u202f\u00bd\u202f(you already have this one), and\u202f\u00be.\n\n4. **Resulting picture**  \n\n```\n0 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u00bc\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u00bd\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u00be\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25001\n```\n\nNow the number line displays the fractions with denominator\u202f2 (\u00bd) and every fraction with denominator\u202f4 (\u00bc,\u202f\u00bd,\u202f\u00be).  \nBecause 4 is a multiple of 2, the \u00bd\u2011mark lines up with the second quarter mark, so both sets of fractions are represented correctly on the same line."
