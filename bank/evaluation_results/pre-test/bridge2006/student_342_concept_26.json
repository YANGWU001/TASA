      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (often called the greatest common divisor, or GCF) of a set of whole numbers is the **largest positive integer that divides each of the numbers exactly**, leaving no remainder.  \n\nIn other words, if you have two numbers\u202f\\(a\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(b\\), the GCF is the biggest number\u202f\\(d\\)\u202fsuch that  \n\n\\[\na = d \\times m \\quad\\text{and}\\quad b = d \\times n\n\\]\n\nfor some integers\u202f\\(m\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(n\\).  \n\nBecause it is the biggest common divisor, the GCF can be used to:\n\n* Simplify fractions (by cancelling the GCF from the numerator and denominator).  \n* Reduce ratios to their simplest form.  \n* Solve problems that involve sharing or grouping objects into equal piles.  \n\n**Typical note:** the GCF is always a positive integer and, for distinct numbers, it is less than or equal to the smaller of the numbers (it can be equal to one of them when one number divides the other)."

In other words, they share no prime factors in common; the only positive integer that divides both of them is\u202f1.
