      "student_answer": "\\(7 \\times 6 = 42\\)  \n\\(8 \\times 5 = 40\\)\n\nSo the product of 7 and 6 is larger; it is **2 more** than the product of 8 and 5."

      "question": "What is the larger product: 3 x 9 or 2 x 12?",

      "student_answer": "The multiplication \\(6 \\times 5\\) equals \\(30\\), while \\(8 \\times 3\\) equals \\(24\\).  \nTherefore, \\(6 \\times 5\\) gives the greater result."

      "student_answer": "The two products are equal:\n\n- \\(15 \\times 2 = 30\\)\n- \\(10 \\times 3 = 30\\)\n\nSo neither is larger; they give the same product."
