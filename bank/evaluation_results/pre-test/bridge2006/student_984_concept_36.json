      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "If a square is divided into 4 equal parts, what fraction of the square does each part represent?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the four equal pieces makes up one\u2011fourth of the whole square.  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Fraction represented by each part} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]"

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "A square is divided into 8 equal sections. What fraction of the square does 3 sections combined represent?",
      "student_answer": "The three sections together make up  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{8}\n\\]\n\nof the whole square."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a square is divided into 5 equal parts, and you shade 2 parts, what fraction of the square is shaded?",
      "student_answer": "The square is split into 5 equal pieces, and 2 of those pieces are shaded.  \nSo the shaded portion is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{shaded pieces}}{\\text{total pieces}} \\;=\\; \\frac{2}{5}.\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{2}{5}\\) of the square is shaded."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "A square is divided into 6 equal pieces. What is the fraction associated with each piece?",
      "student_answer": "Each piece represents **\\( \\displaystyle \\frac{1}{6} \\)** of the whole square, because the square is divided into six equal parts."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How can you express one-third of a square if it is divided into 3 equal parts?",
      "student_answer": "When the square is split into three equal regions, each region makes up one\u2011third of the whole square.  \nSo one of those pieces is expressed as the fraction  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nof the square."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "If a square is divided into 10 equal parts, what fraction would represent 7 parts combined?",
      "student_answer": "The fraction that represents 7 of the 10 equal parts is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{7}{10}\n\\]"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "A square is divided into 4 equal sections, and 1 section is shaded. Write the fraction that represents the shaded part.",
      "student_answer": "The square is divided into 4 equal parts and only 1 of those parts is shaded.  \nBecause each part represents one\u2011fourth of the whole, the shaded portion is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}}\n\\]"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If a square is divided into 12 equal parts and 4 parts are shaded, what fraction of the square is unshaded?",
      "student_answer": "The square has 12 equal parts total.  \nIf 4 parts are shaded, the number of unshaded parts is:\n\n\\(12 - 4 = 8\\) parts.\n\nSo the fraction of the square that is unshaded is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{8}{12} = \\frac{2}{3}.\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{2}{3}\\) of the square is unshaded."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A square is divided into 9 equal pieces. What fraction represents one piece of the square?",
      "student_answer": "One piece of the square is \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{9}\\) of the whole. \n\nSince the square is divided into 9 equal parts, each part represents one\u2011ninth of the total area."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If a square is divided into 2 equal halves and you shade one half, what fraction of the square is shaded?",
      "student_answer": "The square is split into two equal parts, so each part represents one\u2011half of the whole. Since one of those halves is shaded, the shaded portion is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\tfrac{1}{2}}\n\\]"
