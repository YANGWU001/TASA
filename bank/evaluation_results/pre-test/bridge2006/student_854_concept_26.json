  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of GCF, providing correct answers and thorough explanations. The only mistake was in the prime factorization method for Question 3, where the GCF was incorrectly calculated as 12 instead of 12. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of how to find and apply the GCF in various contexts.",

      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) \u2013 also called the greatest common divisor (GCD) \u2013 is the biggest whole number that can divide each of a set of integers without leaving a remainder. In other words, it is the largest positive integer that is a factor of every number in the group.  \n\nThe GCF tells us the most you can \u201cshare\u201d among the numbers:  \n\n* It\u2019s used to simplify fractions, because dividing the numerator and denominator by their GCF reduces the fraction to lowest terms.  \n* It helps break numbers into smaller, equivalent parts when factoring or finding common denominators.  \n* In real\u2011world contexts, it can represent the biggest possible equal groups you can form from two (or more) collections of items.  \n\nSo, the GCF represents the greatest amount of \u201ccommonality\u201d in terms of divisibility among the numbers being considered."
