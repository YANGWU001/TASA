      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into 16 equal smaller squares, they are arranged in a 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 grid.  \nSo there are **4 rows and 4 columns** of the smaller squares."

      "student_answer": "The 25 equal parts are arranged as a square grid:  \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{25}=5\n\\]\n\nSo the square is a \\(5 \\times 5\\) arrangement.  \nTherefore, each row contains **5 parts**."

      "student_answer": "When a square is split into more equal sections, each individual piece must occupy a smaller portion of the whole.\u202fIn other words, as the number of equal parts increases, the area (and thus the size) of each part gets smaller."

      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nYes \u2013 a square can be cut up into identical (congruent) triangles, but only an **even** number of them.  \n\n---\n\n### How it works  \n\n1. **Two triangles** \u2013 Draw one of the square\u2019s diagonals.  \n   * The diagonal splits the square into two right\u2011isosceles triangles.  \n   * Each triangle has the same side\u2011lengths (the two legs are the sides of the square, the hypotenuse is the diagonal) and the same area (half the area of the square).\n\n2. **Four triangles** \u2013 Draw both diagonals.  \n   * The intersection point (the centre of the square) produces four right\u2011isosceles triangles, all congruent to each other.\n\n3. **More triangles** \u2013 Once you have two or four equal pieces you can keep subdividing each triangle in half (by drawing a line from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side). Repeating this operation any number of times gives you \\(2,4,8,16,\\dots\\) equal triangles.\n\n---\n\n### Why an odd number won\u2019t work  \n\nSuppose we try to dissect a square into *n* congruent triangles where *n* is odd.  \nEach triangle must have vertices that are either at a corner of the square or on its edges. When you count the total number of \u201cedge\u2011midpoint\u201d vertices contributed by all the triangles, you always end up with an even number (each interior edge belongs to two triangles).  \n\nIf *n* were odd, the total number of triangle vertices would be \\(3n\\), an odd multiple of\u202f3, which cannot be paired up evenly along the square\u2019s sides. This parity mismatch forces at least one triangle to have a different shape or size, contradicting the requirement that all triangles be identical.  \n\nTherefore a square **cannot** be partitioned into an odd number of congruent triangles, but it can be partitioned into any even number.\n\n---\n\n### Summary  \n\n- A square **can** be divided into equal (congruent) triangles.  \n- The smallest such division uses **2** triangles (a single diagonal).  \n- By further subdivision you can obtain **4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f\u2026** equal triangles, but **never an odd number**.  \n\nSo the answer is \u201cyes, but only in even numbers of triangles, because the geometry of a square forces the pieces to come in pairs.\u201d"

      "student_answer": "The 36 equal squares must form a \\(6 \\times 6\\) grid because \\(6^{2}=36\\).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of small squares along each side} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo each small square\u2019s side length is the original side length divided by 6:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Side length of each small square}= \\frac{12}{6}=2.\n\\]\n\n**Answer:\u202f2 units**."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When we cut a square into several **congruent** (identical) pieces, we are usually talking about dividing its area into equal\u2011size **rectangles**.  \nA rectangle is a quadrilateral whose opposite sides are equal and all angles are right\u2011angles.  \nA **square** is a special type of rectangle in which the two adjacent sides are also equal (its aspect\u2011ratio is 1\u202f:\u202f1).\n\n---\n\n### What the cut does to the side lengths  \n\nSuppose the original square has side length \\(s\\).  \nIf we slice it vertically into \\(n\\) equal strips, each strip has:\n\n* height = \\(s\\) (the same as the original square)  \n* width = \\(\\dfrac{s}{n}\\)\n\nIts dimensions are therefore \\(s \\times \\dfrac{s}{n}\\).  \nBecause \\(\\dfrac{s}{n} \\neq s\\) for any \\(n>1\\), the width and height are not the same, so each piece is a rectangle **but not a square**.\n\nA horizontal cut works the same way, giving pieces of size \\(\\dfrac{s}{n} \\times s\\).  \n\nIf we try a more general grid (say we cut the square into \\(m\\) rows and \\(n\\) columns), each small piece has dimensions  \n\n\\[\n\\text{width}= \\frac{s}{n},\\qquad\n\\text{height}= \\frac{s}{m}.\n\\]\n\nOnly when \\(m=n\\) do we obtain \\(\\frac{s}{n} = \\frac{s}{m}\\), and the pieces become **smaller squares**. Otherwise the aspect ratio \\(\\frac{\\text{height}}{\\text{width}} = \\frac{m}{n}\\) differs from 1, so the pieces are rectangles that are longer in one direction than the other.\n\n---\n\n### Why the pieces can\u2019t be squares unless we use a square grid  \n\nThe requirement \u201cequal rectangles\u201d means the pieces must all have the **same dimensions**.  \nFor those dimensions to satisfy the square condition (equal side lengths), the number of rows must equal the number of columns. In that special case the \u201crectangles\u2019\u2019 are actually squares, and we have simply divided the original square into a chess\u2011board\u2011like array of smaller squares.\n\nIf the rows and columns differ, the side lengths of each piece are forced to be different, so the pieces cannot be squares. In other words, the act of dividing a square into equal\u2011area rectangles inevitably changes the aspect ratio of each piece unless the division respects both the horizontal and vertical spacing equally.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line  \n\n*Dividing a square into equal rectangles changes the relationship between the side lengths of each piece. Because a square requires those side lengths to be identical, the resulting pieces are rectangles, not squares, unless the division is made with the same number of rows and columns (i.e., a grid of smaller squares).*"
