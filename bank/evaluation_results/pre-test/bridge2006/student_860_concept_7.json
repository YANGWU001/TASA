  "feedback": "The student demonstrates an understanding of addition and comparison of sums in some cases, but consistently fails to identify when one sum is larger than another. They correctly identified larger sums in Questions 3, 5, 6, and 7, but incorrectly stated equality in the others. The student should focus on clearly comparing the results of the sums to determine which is larger.",
