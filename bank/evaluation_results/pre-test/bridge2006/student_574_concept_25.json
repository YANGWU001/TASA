However, there are significant misunderstandings in several other answers, particularly in the explanations and calculations.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the least common multiple is kind of the opposite of the greatest common divisor.  It\u2019s the biggest number that the two (or more) original numbers can both divide **into** without leaving a remainder.  So if you have 4 and 6, the LCM would be... I guess 24?  Because 4 goes into 24 six times and 6 goes into 24 four times, right?  Basically it\u2019s the largest shared multiple of the numbers."

For 8, I listed 8,\u202f16,\u202f24,\u202f32\u2026 and for 12 I wrote down 12,\u202f24,\u202f36\u2026 I noticed that 16 shows up in the 8 list, and I thought because 12 is close to 16, it might work\u2026 I guess the LCM is 16. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got."

      "question": "How can you use a number line to visually determine the LCM of 2 and 5?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d draw a number line and start marking the multiples of each number. So you\u2019d put 2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f10,\u202f12\u2026 for the 2\u2019s and 5,\u202f10,\u202f15,\u202f20\u2026 for the 5\u2019s. Then you look for the first spot where the two lists line up.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the first place they meet is at 5, so the LCM would be 5.  (I might be mixing something up\u2026.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Why is the LCM of two prime numbers always equal to their product?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is kind of simple. Since prime numbers don\u2019t share any factors except 1, the only multiple they have in common is just\u2026 well, the product of the two numbers. So the least common multiple ends up being the product itself.  \n\nIn other words, because there\u2019s no smaller number that both primes divide (other than 1, which obviously isn\u2019t a multiple of either), you have to multiply them to get a common multiple, and that\u2019s already the *least* one.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it."

I figured the greatest common factor of 18 and 24 is 6 (since both are divisible by 2 and 3). Then I thought maybe I could just multiply the GCF by one of the numbers, like 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f36, and that would be the least common multiple.  \n\nSo, my answer is 36, and I used the GCF of 6 to get there. (I'm not confident this is right, though.)"
