  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of multipliers in relation to rectangles. Most answers correctly identify the multiplier and its implications on dimensions and area. However, the first answer incorrectly states the multiplier when the width is doubled, as the area is actually multiplied by 2, not just the width.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the multiplier if a rectangle has a length of 8 and the width is doubled?",
      "student_answer": "The area will be multiplied by a factor of **2** (since only the width is doubled while the length stays the same)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a rectangle\u2019s length is multiplied by 3, what is the new length if the original length was 5?",
      "student_answer": "The new length would be \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "A rectangle\u2019s area is increased by multiplying its length by 4. What is the multiplier applied to the length?",
      "student_answer": "I think the multiplier applied to the length is **4**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "The width of a rectangle is tripled. What does the multiplier represent in this case?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier is\u202f3. It shows that the rectangle\u2019s width is being increased to three times its original length."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If the dimensions of a rectangle are multiplied by 2, what happens to the area of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "When each side length of a rectangle is multiplied by\u202f2, the new length is \\(2\\ell\\) and the new width is \\(2w\\).  \n\nThe original area is \\(A = \\ell \\times w\\).  \n\nThe new area is  \n\n\\[\nA' = (2\\ell) \\times (2w) = 4(\\ell \\times w) = 4A .\n\\]\n\nSo the area becomes **four times larger** (it is multiplied by\u202f4)."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A rectangle has a width of 6 meters. The width is multiplied by a factor of 5. What is the new width?",
      "student_answer": "I think the new width would be \\(6 \\times 5 = 30\\)\u202fmeters."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the multiplier used if a rectangle\u2019s width is reduced to half its original size?",
      "student_answer": "I think the multiplier would be\u202f\u00bd\u202f\u2013 so the width is multiplied by\u202f0.5."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is multiplied by 7, how does the multiplier affect the perimeter of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a rectangle is \\(P = 2(\\text{length} + \\text{width})\\).\n\nIf only the length is multiplied by\u202f7 (so the new length is \\(7L\\) while the width stays \\(W\\)), the new perimeter becomes  \n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{new}} = 2\\big(7L + W\\big) = 14L + 2W .\n\\]\n\nThe original perimeter was  \n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{old}} = 2(L + W) = 2L + 2W .\n\\]\n\nSo the perimeter does **not** simply get multiplied by\u202f7. Only the length\u2011portion of the perimeter is multiplied by\u202f7, giving an overall increase of  \n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{new}} - P_{\\text{old}} = (14L + 2W) - (2L + 2W) = 12L .\n\\]\n\nIn short, the new perimeter is \\(14L + 2W\\); the multiplier of 7 affects the perimeter only through the length term."

      "question": "A rectangle\u2019s dimensions are scaled by multiplying both length and width by 3. What is the multiplier for each dimension?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier applied to each dimension is **3**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "The area of a rectangle is doubled by changing the width. What multiplier was applied to the width?",
      "student_answer": "I think the width must be multiplied by **2**."
