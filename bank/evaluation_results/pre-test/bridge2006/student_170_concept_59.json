      "question": "What makes a fraction improper?",
      "student_answer": "A fraction is called **improper** when its numerator is greater than or equal to its denominator (in absolute value). In other words, the top number is at least as large as the bottom number, so the value of the fraction is\u202f\u2265\u202f1 (or \u2264\u202f\u20131 for negative fractions). The denominator must still be a non\u2011zero integer.  \n\n**Example:**  \n\\[\n\\frac{7}{5},\\ \\frac{4}{4},\\ \\frac{-9}{8}\n\\]\nare all improper fractions because the numerator\u2019s magnitude is not smaller than the denominator\u2019s.  \n\nIf the numerator is smaller than the denominator (e.g., \\(\\frac{3}{7}\\)), the fraction is a **proper** fraction."

      "student_answer": "An improper fraction is any fraction whose numerator is **greater than or equal to** its denominator.  \n\nFor the fraction \\(\\dfrac{11}{10}\\):\n\n- The numerator is \\(11\\).\n- The denominator is \\(10\\).\n\nSince \\(11 > 10\\), the fraction represents a value larger than 1 (\\(\\dfrac{11}{10}=1.1\\)). Because the top part (the numerator) is larger than the bottom part (the denominator), \\(\\dfrac{11}{10}\\) fits the definition of an improper fraction."
