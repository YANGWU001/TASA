      "question": "What is the larger product: 3 x 9 or 2 x 12?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the larger product is **2\u202f\u00d7\u202f12**. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 is **not** larger than 7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04. (I guess 10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 might be something like 20 and 7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04 is bigger.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the first farmer planted more trees.  \nHe has 4 rows of 9 trees, which is about 36 trees, and the other farmer\u2019s 6 rows of 7 trees is only around 30 or so. So the first farmer\u2019s total is larger."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think Team A scored higher. They got 6\u202fpoints each game for 8 games, which is more than Team\u202fB\u2019s 5\u202fpoints for 10 games. So Team\u202fA wins."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the two products are kind of close, but\u2026 maybe 25\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 is the bigger one? I\u2019m not really sure, but I feel like 25 times 2 gives a larger result than 20 times 3."
