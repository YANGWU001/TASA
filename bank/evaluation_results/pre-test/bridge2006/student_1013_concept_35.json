      "question": "If a square is divided into 4 equal parts, how many smaller squares are formed?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 4 smaller squares are formed.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nWhen a square is divided into 4 equal parts, each part must have the same shape and size as the others. The only way to split a square into four congruent pieces while keeping the shape of each piece a square is to draw one vertical line and one horizontal line through the center, creating a 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 grid. This results in four identical smaller squares."

      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into 16 equal smaller squares, the pieces form a 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 grid.  \n\n- Number of rows: **4**  \n- Number of columns: **4**  \n\n(4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f16, so the 16 squares are arranged in four rows and four columns.)"

      "question": "A square is divided into 25 equal parts. How many parts are in each row?",
      "student_answer": "Each row contains **5 parts**.  \n\nSince the square is divided into 25 equal squares, it forms a 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 grid, giving 5 squares in every row."

      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is split into more equal sections, each piece must get **smaller**.  \nThe total area stays the same, so the area (and side length) of each part is the original area divided by the number of parts. As the number of sections increases, the size of each individual part decreases."

      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Yes \u2013 a square can be divided into equal (congruent) triangles.**  \n\nThe reason is that a triangle is a very flexible shape: by drawing straight\u2011line cuts inside the square we can create pieces that have exactly the same area **and** the same shape. Here are the simplest ways to do it:\n\n| Division | How to obtain it | Resulting triangles |\n|----------|------------------|---------------------|\n| **2 triangles** | Draw one of the two diagonals of the square. | Two right\u2011isosceles triangles, each with legs equal to the side of the square and area \u00bd\u202f\u00b7\u202fside\u00b2. |\n| **4 triangles** | Draw **both** diagonals (the \u201cX\u201d across the square). | Four congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles, each occupying one quarter of the square\u2019s area. |\n| **8, 12, \u2026 triangles** | Subdivide the square first into a grid of smaller squares, then cut each small square along a diagonal. | A bunch of identical right\u2011isosceles triangles; the number of triangles is twice the number of small squares. |\n| **Other equal\u2011area triangles** | Use more elaborate partitioning (e.g., a \u201ctriangular fan\u201d from a vertex, or a set of parallel lines that meet at a point). | Still possible to get all pieces congruent; the shapes are usually right or isosceles triangles. |\n\n**Why it works**\n\n* A diagonal of a square connects two opposite vertices, turning the square into two right\u2011isosceles triangles that share the same side lengths.  \n* Because the diagonal is a straight line, the two halves have exactly the same area and are mirror images of each\u202fother\u2014hence congruent.  \n* Repeating the same operation on each of a collection of equal\u2011sized sub\u2011squares gives any even number of equal triangles.\n\n**A note on odd numbers**\n\nDividing a square into an odd number of *congruent* triangles is much harder and, for most odd counts (e.g., 3, 5, 7), impossible if the triangles must be straight\u2011edge pieces that fill the square without gaps or overlaps. The simplest partitions that guarantee congruence always produce an **even** number of triangles (2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8, \u2026).\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** A square can certainly be tiled with equal triangles\u2014just draw one diagonal for two triangles, both diagonals for four, or combine diagonal cuts with a grid of smaller squares for any larger even number. The ability comes from the fact that a diagonal splits the square into two identical right\u2011isosceles triangles, and that process can be repeated as many times as needed."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "Each smaller square occupies one\u2011th of the side length of the large square, because the 36 equal squares form a 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f6 grid (\u221a36\u202f=\u202f6).  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Side of small square}= \\frac{\\text{Side of large square}}{6}= \\frac{12}{6}=2\n\\]\n\n**Answer: 2 units**."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into several **congruent** (identical) rectangles, the pieces cannot all be squares because the dimensions that define a square are lost in the division.\n\nA square has two equal side lengths, say \\(s\\).  \nIf we cut the square into \\(n\\) equal rectangles by drawing parallel lines in **one** direction only (for example, vertical cuts), each piece will:\n\n* retain the full height of the original square, which is \\(s\\);\n* have a width that is only a fraction of the original side, namely \\(\\dfrac{s}{n}\\).\n\nThus every piece has dimensions \\(s \\times \\dfrac{s}{n}\\).  \nSince \\(s \\neq \\dfrac{s}{n}\\) for any \\(n>1\\), the width and height are different, so each piece is a **rectangle**, not a square.\n\nIf we try to cut the square in **both** directions (forming a grid), the only way for all the small pieces to be equal squares is to make the cuts at equal intervals in both directions. That yields smaller squares, not rectangles. To obtain rectangles, the spacing between the vertical cuts must differ from the spacing between the horizontal cuts, again giving pieces whose side lengths are unequal.\n\nIn short, dividing a square into equal rectangles forces at least one dimension of each piece to stay the same as the original square while the other dimension becomes a proper fraction of it. Because the two side lengths are no longer equal, the resulting parts are rectangles, not squares."
