      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Yes \u2013 a square can be split into congruent (identical) triangles.**  \nThe simplest way to see this is to draw a single diagonal of the square:\n\n```\nA \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 B\n\u2502 \\      \u2502\n\u2502   \\    \u2502\n\u2502     \\  \u2502\n\u2502       \\\u2502\nD \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 C\n```\n\nThe diagonal \\(AC\\) (or \\(BD\\)) divides the square into two right\u2011isosceles triangles that are exactly the same size and shape.  \n\n---\n\n### More ways to do it  \n\n| Number of triangles | How to obtain them | Reason it works |\n|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| **2** | One diagonal (as above). | Two right\u2011isosceles triangles, each with half the area of the square. |\n| **4** | Both diagonals intersecting at the centre. | Four right\u2011isosceles triangles, each with one\u2011quarter the area. |\n| **8** | Connect the centre to the mid\u2011points of each side (or draw a \u201cstar\u201d of four lines through the centre). | Eight congruent isosceles triangles, each with one\u2011eighth the area. |\n| **\\(2k\\)** (any even number) | First draw the two diagonals to get four \u201ccorner\u201d triangles, then repeatedly bisect each of those triangles with a line through the centre (or through the mid\u2011point of a side). | Each bisection halves the area, so after \\(k\\!-\\!2\\) bisections you have \\(2k\\) equal triangles. |\n\nIn each case the triangles share a common vertex at the centre of the square, and the other vertices lie on the sides or corners of the square. Because the square is perfectly symmetric, all the resulting triangles have the same shape and area.\n\n---\n\n### Why an odd number (other than\u202f1) won\u2019t work for *congruent* triangles  \n\nIf you require the triangles to be **congruent** (identical in shape and size), an odd number of them is impossible for the following reason:\n\n*Each triangle has three interior angles that must sum to \\(180^\\circ\\). When you tile a square, the total sum of all interior angles of the triangles must equal the sum of the square\u2019s interior angles, i.e. \\(360^\\circ\\).*\n\nIf you have an odd number \\(n\\) of triangles, the total sum of their interior angles would be  \n\n\\[\nn \\times 180^\\circ = \\text{odd} \\times 180^\\circ = \\text{an even multiple of }90^\\circ,\n\\]\n\nbut the square\u2019s interior angle sum is only \\(360^\\circ\\). The only way the numbers can match is if the extra angles can be \u201cabsorbed\u2019\u2019 at the square\u2019s four corners, which can only happen when the triangles are paired up around each corner. This pairing forces the total number of triangles to be even.  \n\nHence, apart from the trivial case of a single triangle (the whole square itself), you cannot dissect a square into an odd number of *congruent* triangles.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line  \n\n- **Yes**, a square can be divided into equal (congruent) triangles.  \n- The easiest partitions give 2 or 4 triangles, but by using the centre and drawing additional symmetry lines you can obtain any even number of congruent triangles.  \n- An odd number greater than\u202f1 is impossible for congruent triangles because of the way interior angles must add up.  \n\nSo the answer is **yes**, but only for an even number of equal triangles (2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f\u2026); the simplest examples are the 2\u2011triangle and 4\u2011triangle dissections."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When we cut a square into **equal rectangles** we are usually thinking of two things:\n\n1. **All the pieces have the same area** (they are \u201cequal\u201d in size).  \n2. **Each piece is a rectangle** (its opposite sides are parallel and the interior angles are 90\u00b0).\n\nA rectangle is a square only when its two side\u2011lengths are the same.  \nIf we divide a square by drawing only one family of parallel cuts (for instance, a vertical line down the middle), the resulting pieces are rectangles whose **length** is the side of the original square and whose **width** is only a fraction of that side. Because the length and width are different, the pieces are *not* squares.\n\nMore generally, suppose the original square has side length \\(s\\).  \nIf we split it into \\(m\\) columns and \\(n\\) rows of equal rectangles, each piece will have dimensions  \n\n\\[\n\\text{width}= \\frac{s}{m},\\qquad \n\\text{height}= \\frac{s}{n}.\n\\]\n\nOnly when \\(m=n\\) do we get \\(\\frac{s}{m} = \\frac{s}{n}\\), i.e., each piece\u2019s width equals its height, and the pieces are themselves squares.  \nIf \\(m\\neq n\\) (for example, 2 columns by 1 row, 3 columns by 2 rows, etc.), the width and height differ, and every piece is a non\u2011square rectangle even though all pieces have the same area \\(\\frac{s^{2}}{mn}\\).\n\nThus, **dividing a square into equal rectangles does not automatically produce squares** because the division determines two independent side lengths for each piece. Only a special case\u2014when the number of rows equals the number of columns\u2014makes those rectangles squares. Otherwise the pieces retain the rectangular shape with unequal side lengths."
