      "question": "Explain the concept of a whole number lower bound in your own words.",
      "student_answer": "A whole\u2011number lower bound is simply the biggest integer that you can be sure is **not larger** than the number (or all the numbers) you\u2019re looking at. In other words, it\u2019s the integer you get when you \u201cround down\u201d a value to the nearest whole number. For any real number\u202fx, the whole\u2011number lower bound is the integer\u202fn such that n\u202f\u2264\u202fx and n\u202f+\u202f1\u202f>\u202fx \u2013 it\u2019s the floor of\u202fx. This gives you a safe, whole\u2011number estimate that never overshoots the actual value."

      "student_answer": "No.  \n\nThe whole\u2011number lower bound of a decimal is the greatest whole number that is **less than or equal to** that decimal.  \n\nSince\u202f9.99 lies between 9 and 10, the whole number that is not greater than 9.99 is 9. Therefore the lower bound is 9, not 10."

      "student_answer": "The whole\u2011number lower bound of \\(-3.7\\) is \\(-4\\).\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe whole\u2011number lower bound (sometimes called the \u201cgreatest integer less than or equal to\u201d the given number) is the largest whole number that does not exceed the number.  \n\n- Since \\(-3\\) is greater than \\(-3.7\\), it is not a lower bound.  \n- The next whole number down is \\(-4\\), and \\(-4 \\le -3.7\\).  \n\nTherefore, \\(-4\\) is the greatest whole number that is still less than or equal to \\(-3.7\\), making it the whole\u2011number lower bound."

      "question": "What role does rounding play when determining the whole number lower bound of a number?",
      "student_answer": "Rounding is the tool we use to translate a non\u2011integer value into a whole\u2011number estimate, and the direction of the rounding tells us which bound we are getting.\n\n* **Rounding down (or \u201cflooring\u201d)** a number to the nearest whole number gives the **whole\u2011number lower bound**.  \n  * It is the greatest integer that is **not greater than** the original number.  \n  * For example, the lower bound of 7.84 is 7, because rounding 7.84 down to the nearest integer yields 7.\n\n* **Rounding up (or \u201cceiling\u201d)** would produce the **upper bound**, i.e., the smallest integer that is **not less than** the original number.\n\nThus, when we need the whole\u2011number lower bound, we round the original number **downward** to the nearest integer. This ensures the bound is always \u2264 the original value and provides a safe \u201cminimum\u201d whole\u2011number approximation."

      "student_answer": "The whole\u2011number lower bound (the greatest integer that does not exceed the number) of \\(0.99\\) is **0**.\n\n**Justification:**  \nFor any real number \\(x\\), the lower\u2011bound integer is the largest integer \\(n\\) such that \\(n \\le x\\).  \nSince \\(0 \\le 0.99 < 1\\), the integers that satisfy \\(n \\le 0.99\\) are \u2026,\u202f\u20132,\u202f\u20131,\u202f0.
