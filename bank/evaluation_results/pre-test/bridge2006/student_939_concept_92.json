      "student_answer": "A **whole\u2011number lower bound** for a quantity is the biggest whole (i.e., integer\u202f\u2265\u202f0) that is still **not larger** than the number we\u2019re approximating.  \nIn other words, it is the greatest integer that you can place \u201cunder\u201d the value without going over it.  \n\nFor example, if a measurement is 7.3, the whole\u2011number lower bound is 7, because 7\u202f\u2264\u202f7.3 and any larger whole number (8,\u202f9,\u202f\u2026) would be greater than the actual value.  \n\nThe idea is useful when we need a simple, guaranteed\u2011minimum whole\u2011number estimate of something that may not be a whole number itself."

      "question": "What role does rounding play when determining the whole number lower bound of a number?",
      "student_answer": "Rounding is used to \u201cbring the number down\u201d to the nearest whole\u2011number value that is still less than or equal to the original quantity.  \nWhen we want the whole\u2011number lower bound of a number, we round it **down** (i.e., take the floor) to the next integer. This guarantees that the bound is not higher than the actual number, providing a safe underestimate that can be used in proofs, estimates, or further calculations."

      "student_answer": "The **whole\u2011number lower bound** of a real number is the greatest whole number that is **not larger** than the number.  \nIn other words, it is the integer \u201cjust below\u201d (or equal to) the value \u2013 it is the **floor** of the number.\n\nThe **ceiling** of a number, on the other hand, is the smallest whole number that is **not smaller** than the number.  \nIt is the integer \u201cjust above\u201d (or equal to) the value \u2013 the **ceiling** of the number.\n\n---\n\n### Example  \n\nTake the number \\(7.3\\).\n\n* **Whole\u2011number lower bound (floor):** \\( \\displaystyle\\lfloor 7.3 \\rfloor = 7\\).  \n  This is the greatest integer \u2264\u202f7.3.\n\n* **Ceiling:** \\( \\displaystyle\\lceil 7.3 \\rceil = 8\\).  \n  This is the smallest integer \u2265\u202f7.3.\n\nSo the lower bound gives the integer on the \u201clower\u201d side of the number, while the ceiling gives the integer on the \u201cupper\u201d side."
