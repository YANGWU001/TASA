  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of basic concepts related to dividing squares into equal parts. All answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about the shapes and dimensions resulting from such divisions. The student should review the properties of squares and how they can be divided into equal sections, as well as the implications of these divisions on the resulting shapes.",

      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think when you divide a square into more equal sections, each part actually gets a little bigger, because you\u2019re spreading the area over more pieces\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think each of the four sections would be a **rectangle** rather than a square."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think you can\u2019t really split a square into a bunch of equal triangles. I mean, a square is made of four equal sides and right angles, and triangles have three sides, so the shapes don\u2019t match up that well. Maybe you could draw a diagonal and get two triangles, but they wouldn\u2019t be \u201cequal\u201d to the whole square or to each other in the same way the smaller squares would be. So, I guess a square can\u2019t be divided into equal triangles the way it can be divided into smaller squares."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think each of the little squares would have a side length of about  \n\n**\\( \\displaystyle \\frac{12}{36}\\approx 0.33\\)**  \n\nunits.  (I might be mixing up the division, so take that with a grain of salt.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the reason is that when you cut a square into equal rectangles you actually change the shape of the pieces. The cut makes the sides of each piece different lengths, so the corners aren\u2019t \u201csquare\u201d any more. I guess the angles might even become a little off\u2011center, like they\u2019re not exactly 90\u00b0 anymore, which is why the pieces end up as rectangles instead of squares. I\u2019m pretty hazy on the details, though."

      "question": "Draw a square divided into 9 equal sections and label the dimensions of each smaller square if the original square has a side length of 3 units.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you would split the big 3\u2011unit side into three equal parts.  If I just divide 3 by the number of little squares (9), I get about **0.33\u202funits** for the side of each little square.  \n\nSo, picture a big square and draw two vertical lines and two horizontal lines inside it, making a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid of nine little squares.  Each of those little squares would be labeled something like  \n\n- side\u202f\u2248\u202f0.33\u202funits  \n- area\u202f\u2248\u202f0.33\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.33\u202f\u2248\u202f0.11\u202fsquare\u202funits  \n\n(You could also write \u201c0.33\u202funits\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.33\u202funits\u201d inside each little square.)  \n\nI hope that\u2019s close enough\u2026\u200b"
