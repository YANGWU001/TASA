  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of equal divisions in horizontal bars, correctly identifying the number of divisions in most cases. However, there were minor errors in Questions 3 and 9, where the focus was on fractions rather than the number of divisions. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the topic.",

      "question": "How many equal divisions are there in a horizontal bar divided into 4 sections?",
      "student_answer": "The horizontal bar is divided into **4 equal sections**, so there are **4 equal divisions**."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What is the total number of equal divisions in a horizontal bar divided into thirds?",
