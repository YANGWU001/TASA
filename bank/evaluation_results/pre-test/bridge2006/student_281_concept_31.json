If any measurement is off, adjust the bars slightly.\n\n7. **Result.**  \n   The rectangle is now divided into **five equal vertical sections** by the four equally spaced vertical bars.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- 4 vertical bars \u2192 5 equal divisions.  \n- Find *W*, compute *W \u00f7 5*, and place the bars at the 1\u20445, 2\u20445, 3\u20445, and 4\u20445 positions across the width.  \n- Verify that all gaps are the same size. This ensures the divisions are truly equal."

      "question": "Explain why placing 6 vertical bars in a rectangle results in 7 equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "When you draw vertical bars inside a rectangle, each bar acts as a **boundary** between two adjacent parts.  \n\n1. **Start with the left edge of the rectangle.**  \n   - Before you add any bars, the left edge itself is one \u201cdivision.\u201d\n\n2. **Add the first vertical bar.**  \n   - This bar creates a new region to its right, so now there are **two** divisions: the area between the left edge and the first bar, and the area to the right of the first bar.\n\n3. **Add a second vertical bar.**  \n   - The second bar adds another region between it and the first bar, giving **three** divisions.\n\n4. **Continue this process.**  \n   - Every time you place a new vertical bar, you insert one more region **between** that bar and the bar (or edge) that lies immediately to its left.\n\n5. **Count the total after six bars.**  \n   - Starting with the left edge (1 division) and then adding six bars, each adds one more division:  \n     \\[\n     1\\;(\\text{left edge}) + 6\\;(\\text{bars}) = 7\\;\\text{divisions}.\n     \\]\n\nThese seven divisions are the vertical strips that run from the top of the rectangle to the bottom. If the bars are spaced evenly, each of the seven strips has the same width, so the rectangle is divided into **seven equal parts**."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How does the number of vertical bars relate to the total number of equal divisions in a given shape?",
      "student_answer": "The vertical bars are the \u201ccutting lines\u201d that split the shape into equal parts.  \nStarting with the whole shape as a single region, each time you add a vertical bar you create one extra region.  \n\n**Therefore, the total number of equal divisions = (number of vertical bars)\u202f+\u202f1.**  \n\n(If the bars themselves are counted as the boundaries of the divisions rather than the divisions, you would simply say that the number of divisions is the same as the number of bars. In most textbook problems, however, the\u202f+\u202f1 rule is the one that\u2019s intended.)"

      "question": "Illustrate with an example how placing 10 vertical bars in a square creates multiple equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "One way to see how vertical bars can slice a square into equal parts is to start with a simple\u2011sized square and then draw a series of equally\u2011spaced bars inside it.\n\n**Example**\n\n1.\u202fDraw a square that is 10\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202fcm.  \n2.\u202fChoose a thin \u201cvertical bar\u2019\u2019 that is just a line (its thickness is not important for the division).  \n3.\u202fPlace the first bar 1\u202fcm from the left edge of the square.  \n4.\u202fFrom there, mark off a distance of 1\u202fcm and draw the second bar.  \n5.\u202fContinue this process until you have drawn a total of **10** vertical bars, each separated from the next by 1\u202fcm.\n\nBecause the square is 10\u202fcm wide and the bars are spaced 1\u202fcm apart, the space between any two consecutive bars (or between a bar and the outer edge of the square) is exactly the same \u2013 1\u202fcm.  \n\nThus the square is divided into **10 equal vertical strips**, each strip being 1\u202fcm wide and 10\u202fcm tall, so every strip has the same area (10\u202fcm\u00b2).  \n\n(If you count the outer edges as \u201cextra\u2019\u2019 divisions, you would see 11 boundaries, but the actual number of equal pieces created by the 10 bars is 10.)"
