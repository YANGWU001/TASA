      "question": "Describe how you would divide a circle into 5 equal sections.",
      "student_answer": "To split a circle into five equal parts you need each sector to have a central angle of  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{360^\\circ}{5}=72^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nHere\u2019s a step\u2011by\u2011step way to do it with a ruler and a protractor (or with a compass\u2011only construction if you prefer).\n\n---\n\n### 1. Draw the basic circle\n1. Place the point of a compass on the paper and draw a circle.  \n2. Keep the compass open at the same radius and mark the centre **O** of the circle.\n\n### 2. Locate the first radius\n1. Draw any straight line through **O** to the edge of the circle; call the point where it meets the circle **A**.  \n2. The line **OA** is the first radius and will be the start of the first sector.\n\n### 3. Mark the 72\u00b0 increments\n1. Place the center of a protractor on **O**, aligning the 0\u00b0 line with **OA**.  \n2. Starting at **OA**, mark a point on the circumference at **72\u00b0**; label that point **B**.  \n3. Without moving the protractor, continue measuring another **72\u00b0** from **OB** and mark point **C** (144\u00b0 from the start).  \n4. Repeat for the next two increments: point **D** at 216\u00b0 and point **E** at 288\u00b0.\n\n*(If you don\u2019t have a protractor, you can construct the same angles by first drawing a regular pentagon inside the circle \u2013 the vertices of the pentagon lie exactly at those five points.)*\n\n### 4. Draw the remaining radii\n1. Connect **O** to each of the new points **B, C, D, E** with straight lines.  \n2. You should now have five radii: **OA, OB, OC, OD, OE**.\n\n### 5. Verify the division\n- Each sector (e.g., the region between **OA** and **OB**) subtends a central angle of 72\u00b0, so all five sectors are congruent.  \n- The five \u201cpie\u2011slice\u201d pieces together make up the whole circle.\n\n---\n\n#### Quick alternative: using a compass (no protractor)\n\n1. Draw the circle and its centre **O**.  \n2. Pick a point **A** on the circumference.  \n3. With the compass set to the same radius, step around the circle: place the compass point on **A**, draw an arc that intersects the circle at **B**; repeat from **B** to get **C**, and so on.  \n4. After four steps you will land back at **A**, having placed five equally spaced points **A, B, C, D, E** on the circle.  \n5. Connect each point to **O** \u2013 you have the five equal sections.\n\nEither method gives you five identical slices of the circle, each covering 72\u00b0 of the total 360\u00b0."

      "student_answer": "**How to divide a circle into equal sections**\n\n1. **Find the centre** \u2013 Draw the circle and mark its centre\u202f\\(O\\).\n\n2. **Choose the number of divisions** \u2013 Let the required number of equal parts be \\(n\\).  \n   The whole circle measures \\(360^{\\circ}\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the central angle** \u2013 Each slice will have the same central angle  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Angle per slice}= \\frac{360^{\\circ}}{n}.\n\\]\n\n4. **Mark the angles** \u2013  \n   * Using a protractor, place its centre on \\(O\\).  \n   * Starting from a reference radius (for example, the horizontal line to the right of \\(O\\)), measure the angle found in step\u202f3 and draw a new radius.  \n   * Continue measuring the same angle around the circle until you have drawn \\(n\\) radii. The points where the radii intersect the circumference are the division points.\n\n5. **Check** \u2013 The sum of all the measured angles should be \\(360^{\\circ}\\); the radii should be evenly spaced.\n\n---\n\n### Example: 9 equal divisions\n\n- Number of divisions \\(n = 9\\).  \n- Central angle for each slice  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{360^{\\circ}}{9}=40^{\\circ}.\n\\]\n\nSo each of the nine radii must be spaced **40\u202fdegrees** apart.\n\n**Procedure**\n\n1. Place the protractor\u2019s centre at the circle\u2019s centre \\(O\\).  \n2. Draw the first radius (the reference line).  \n3. From that line, measure \\(40^{\\circ}\\); draw the second radius.  \n4. Repeat the \\(40^{\\circ}\\) measurement eight more times.  \n5. After the ninth measurement you will be back at the starting line, confirming that the whole circle has been divided into nine equal parts.\n\nEach sector therefore has an interior angle of **40\u00b0**, and the nine radii cut the circle into nine congruent pieces."
