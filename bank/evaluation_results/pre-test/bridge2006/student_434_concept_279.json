      "question": "Explain how you can identify a negative integer on a number line.",
      "student_answer": "To spot a negative integer on a number\u2011line you usually do two things:\n\n1. **Look at the sign.**  \n   Any whole number that has a \u201c\u2011\u201d in front of it (\u20111, \u20112, \u20113 \u2026) is a negative integer.  \n\n2. **Check its position relative to\u202f0.**  \n   On the usual number\u2011line the values increase as you move **right**.  \n   So the points that lie **to the left of\u202f0** are the negative ones.  \n   (Zero itself is not negative or positive, and the numbers farther left are\n   increasingly \u201cmore negative.\u201d)\n\nIn practice you just find the tick marks that are left of the zero\u2011mark and\nsee which of those have a minus sign. Those are the negative integers.\n\n*I think* that if a number\u2011line were drawn backwards (with larger numbers on the left),\nthe \u201cleft\u2011of\u2011zero\u201d rule would flip, but in the standard orientation it\u2019s always\nthe left side that holds the negatives.  \n\n**Common mistakes to watch out for:**  \n- Sometimes people forget that a negative integer can be even (\u20112, \u20114, \u2026), not just odd.  \n- A \u201c\u2011\u201d sign on a fraction (\u2011\u00bd) means it\u2019s a negative rational, not an integer.  \n- Zero is not a negative integer, even though it sits between the positive and\nnegative parts of the line."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "What is the difference between negative integers and positive integers on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "On a typical horizontal number line zero sits in the middle.  \n- **Positive integers** are the whole\u2011number points that lie to the right of zero (1,\u202f2,\u202f3, \u2026) and they get bigger as you move farther right.  \n- **Negative integers** are the whole\u2011number points that lie to the left of zero (\u20111,\u202f\u20112,\u202f\u20113, \u2026) and they get \u201csmaller\u201d as you move farther left.  \n\nSo the main difference is their position relative to zero: positives are on the right side, negatives on the left side.  \n\nI think the sign also matters \u2013 a negative sign means the number is on the left side of zero, while a plus sign (or no sign) means it\u2019s on the right side.  \n\n*(Probably also that negative numbers are \u201cless than\u201d positive numbers, even though they can be the same distance from zero.)*"
