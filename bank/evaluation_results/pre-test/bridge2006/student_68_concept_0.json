      "student_answer": "Multiplying the numbers gives:\n\n- \\(7 \\times 6 = 42\\)\n- \\(8 \\times 5 = 40\\)\n\nSince \\(42\\) is greater than \\(40\\), the product of \\(7\\) and \\(6\\) is larger. In fact, it is **2 more** than the product of \\(8\\) and \\(5\\)."

      "student_answer": "The product \\(3 \\times 9 = 27\\).\n\nThe product \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\).\n\nSince \\(27 > 24\\), the larger product is **\\(3 \\times 9\\)**."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, \\(10 \\times 3\\) is larger than \\(7 \\times 4\\).\n\n**Explanation:**  \n\n- \\(10 \\times 3 = 30\\)  \n- \\(7 \\times 4 = 28\\)  \n\nSince \\(30 > 28\\), the product \\(10 \\times 3\\) is the larger quantity."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** The second farmer planted more trees.\n\n**Explanation:**  \n- First farmer: \\(4 \\text{ rows} \\times 9 \\text{ trees per row} = 36\\) trees.  \n- Second farmer: \\(6 \\text{ rows} \\times 7 \\text{ trees per row} = 42\\) trees.  \n\nSince\u202f42\u202f>\u202f36, the second farmer has the larger quantity of trees."
