  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the concept of LCM, but many answers are incorrect. They struggle with correctly identifying LCMs and explaining the concept clearly. There is confusion about how to find LCMs, especially when using methods like prime factorization and the relationship between LCM and GCF. More practice and clarification on these concepts are needed.",

      "question": "Explain what the least common multiple represents in mathematical terms.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the least common multiple, or LCM, is kind of the \u201csmallest\u201d number that you can get by multiplying the two (or more) numbers together\u2026 like you just multiply them and then pick the smallest result? So if you have 4 and 6, you\u2019d do 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f24 and that would be the LCM. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess it\u2019s the smallest common multiple you can find, even though sometimes you might have to check smaller numbers first. Maybe it\u2019s the biggest number that both numbers divide into? I\u2019m a little confused."

I listed a few multiples of 8: 8,\u202f16,\u202f24,\u202f32,\u202f40\u2026  \n2. Then I listed a few multiples of 12: 12,\u202f24,\u202f36,\u202f48\u2026  \n3. I looked for a number that appears in both lists, and I thought maybe 20 could work because 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f2.5\u202f=\u202f20 and 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.66\u2026 is kind of close, so I guessed 20 as the first common multiple.\n\nI\u2019m not very confident about this, so I could be wrong."

      "question": "How can you use a number line to visually determine the LCM of 2 and 5?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d start by drawing a straight line and marking off the multiples of each number. So you\u2019d put a dot at 0, then 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 \u2026 for the 2\u2011s, and another set of dots at 0, 5, 10, 15 \u2026 for the 5\u2011s. Then you look for the first spot where the two sets line up again after 0. I guess that would be\u2026 maybe 5? Or is it 10? I\u2019m not really sure which one is the first common point \u2013 I think it\u2019s the one where both lines have a dot at the same spot, so \u2026 I\u2019ll go with 5? Yeah, I think the LCM is 5. (I\u2019m pretty shaky on this.)"

      "question": "Why is the LCM of two prime numbers always equal to their product?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the LCM of two prime numbers is just the larger prime. Since primes don\u2019t share any factors, the only multiple they have in common is the bigger one, so the least common multiple would be that number.  (I might be mixing things up\u2026.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the LCM of 18 and 24 is **36**.\n\nThe way I remember it is that you first find the greatest common factor (GCF). For 18 and 24 the GCF is 6, right? Then you kind of use that to \u201cscale up\u201d the numbers. I thought you could do something like take the larger number (24) and subtract the GCF (6) a few times until it lines up with a multiple of the smaller number. So 24\u202f\u2013\u202f6\u202f=\u202f18, and 18 is already a multiple of 18, so I guessed the common multiple would be 36. \n\nI\u2019m not really confident about the exact steps, but I think that\u2019s how the GCF helps you get the LCM."
