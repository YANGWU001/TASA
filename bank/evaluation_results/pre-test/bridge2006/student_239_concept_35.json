      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Yes \u2013 a square can be divided into equal (congruent) triangles.**  \n\nThe only thing a shape must satisfy to be \u201cdivided into equal pieces\u2019\u2019 is that the pieces:\n\n1. **Fit together without overlap** and **cover the whole original region**, and  \n2. **Are congruent to one another** (same shape\u202f+\u202fsame size).\n\nA square meets both criteria for several simple triangular dissections:\n\n| # of triangles | Construction | Why the triangles are equal |\n|----------------|--------------|-----------------------------|\n| **2** | Draw **one diagonal** of the square. | The diagonal splits the square into two right\u2011isosceles triangles. They share the same legs (the sides of the square) and the same hypotenuse (the diagonal), so they are congruent. |\n| **4** | Draw **both diagonals**. | The two diagonals intersect at the centre, giving four right\u2011isosceles triangles. Each has the same two leg lengths (half a side of the square) and the same hypotenuse (half a diagonal), so all four are congruent. |\n| **n\u202f\u2265\u202f2** (even) | Connect the centre of the square to the mid\u2011points of the sides (or any set of equally spaced points on the perimeter) and then draw lines from those points to the centre. | Every triangle shares the centre as a common vertex and has the same base length (e.g., the side\u2011midpoint spacing). All resulting triangles have identical side\u2011lengths and therefore are congruent. |\n| **3** (or other odd numbers) | Choose a point inside the square such that lines drawn to the three vertices (or to three equally spaced points on the perimeter) give three triangles of equal area. Although the shapes are not all identical, you can still obtain three **equal\u2011area** triangles; a true congruent\u2011triangle tiling with three pieces is impossible because the interior angles would not sum correctly. |\n\n### Why it works\n- **Area:** The total area of the square is the sum of the areas of the triangles. If the triangles are congruent, each must have area\u202f=\u202f(Area of square)\u202f\u00f7\u202f(number of triangles).\n- **Shape:** By using a diagonal (or both diagonals) we create right\u2011isosceles triangles whose side lengths are determined uniquely by the side length of the square, guaranteeing congruence.\n- **No geometric obstruction:** There is nothing in the definition of a square that forces its dissection to consist only of smaller squares. Any polygon can be dissected into triangles (triangulation), and we can arrange the cuts so the resulting triangles are equal.\n\n### Bottom line\nA square **can** be divided into equal triangles. The simplest example is a single diagonal, which yields two congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles. More elaborate constructions (both diagonals, radial lines from the centre, etc.) give four or any even number of equal triangles. The only limitation is for certain odd numbers (e.g., three) where you cannot get congruent triangles, though you can still achieve equal\u2011area triangles."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "The 36 equal parts must be arranged as a \\(6 \\times 6\\) grid (since \\(\\sqrt{36}=6\\)).  \n\nSo each side of the original square is divided into 6 equal segments:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Side of each small square}= \\frac{\\text{Original side length}}{6}\n= \\frac{12}{6}=2.\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When we cut a square into several **congruent** pieces we have to keep two things in mind:\n\n1. **All the pieces must have the same shape and size** (they are \u201cequal\u201d).\n2. **The original figure is a square**, so its side lengths are the same:\u202f\\(s \\times s\\).\n\nIf we try to make the pieces **rectangles** that are all the same, the only way a rectangle can also be a square is when its length and width are equal.  \nSo the pieces will be squares **only if** the division is done in a grid that has the same number of rows as columns (e.g., 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4, 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5, \u2026). In that case each small piece has side length \\(s/n\\) and is itself a square.\n\nIn most other ways of dividing a square you do **not** have the same number of rows and columns.  \nFor example, if we slice the square into three vertical strips, each strip has dimensions  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{s}{3}\\text{ (width)} \\times s\\text{ (height)},\n\\]\n\nor if we slice it into two horizontal strips, each has dimensions  \n\n\\[\ns\\text{ (width)} \\times \\frac{s}{2}\\text{ (height)}.\n\\]\n\nIn both cases the length and the width of each piece are different, so the pieces are **rectangles, not squares**.  \n\n**In short:**  \n- A rectangle is only a square when its length equals its width.  \n- Dividing a square into equal rectangles usually changes one dimension while keeping the other the original side length, producing unequal side lengths for each piece.  \n- Therefore the resulting parts are rectangles, not squares, unless the division is a perfect \\(n \\times n\\) grid, which would actually produce smaller squares rather than rectangles."
