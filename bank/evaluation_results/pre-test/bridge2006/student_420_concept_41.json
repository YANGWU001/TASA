  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of counting shaded parts and the concept of contiguity. However, in Question 6, the student incorrectly stated that 3 non-contiguous shaded parts are each a contiguous block, which shows a misunderstanding of the term 'contiguous'. Overall, the student has a good grasp of the material with only one significant error.",

      "question": "Look at the vertical bar divided into 12 equal parts, where 7 parts are shaded. How many shaded parts are there?",
      "student_answer": "The bar shows **7** of its 12 equal parts shaded, so there are **7 shaded parts**."

      "question": "If a vertical bar shows 6 shaded parts out of 15 sections, how many shaded parts are contiguous?",
      "student_answer": "The 6 shaded parts are all together, so the number of contiguous (consecutive) shaded parts is **6**."

      "question": "A vertical bar is divided into 20 segments, and 10 consecutive parts are shaded. How many shaded parts are there?",
      "student_answer": "The bar has 10 consecutive segments that are shaded, so the number of shaded parts is **10**."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Examine a vertical bar divided into 9 sections. If 3 non-contiguous parts are shaded, how many contiguous shaded parts can you count?",
      "student_answer": "The three shaded sections are isolated from one another, so each one forms its own contiguous block.  \n**Number of contiguous shaded parts = 3.**"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If a vertical bar has 18 sections with 6 shaded parts in a row, what is the count of shaded parts?",
      "student_answer": "The count of shaded parts is **6**."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "A vertical bar shows 4 shaded parts out of 10 total sections. Are all shaded parts contiguous? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "No \u2013 the fact that\u202f4 of the\u202f10 sections are shaded does **not** by itself guarantee that the shaded sections are contiguous.  \nTo be contiguous, the four shaded blocks must occupy four successive positions in the bar (for example, sections\u202f3\u20114\u20115\u20116). If any unshaded section appears between two shaded ones (e.g., shading sections\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f5,\u202f9), then the shaded parts are **not** contiguous.  \n\nSo you need to look at the actual arrangement of the shaded sections: only when all four shaded parts are adjacent are they considered contiguous."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "A vertical bar is divided into 16 parts, where 5 shaded parts are non-contiguous. How does this affect the count of contiguous shaded sections?",
      "student_answer": "Because the five shaded pieces are **not touching one another**, each one forms its own uninterrupted block.  \nIn a vertical bar, a \u201ccontiguous shaded section\u201d is a group of shaded parts that are directly adjacent. Since none of the five shaded parts share a border, none can be combined into a larger group.  \n\n**Result:** the bar contains **5 separate contiguous shaded sections** (one for each isolated shaded part)."
