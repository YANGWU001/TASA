      "student_answer": "An improper fraction is one whose numerator is **greater than or equal to** its denominator (in absolute value). In other words, the top number is at least as large as the bottom number, so the value of the fraction is **greater than or equal to\u202f1** (or \u2264\u202f\u20111 if both numbers are negative).  \n\nExamples:  \n\n- \\(\\frac{7}{5}\\) (7\u202f\u2265\u202f5) \u2192 improper  \n- \\(\\frac{9}{9}\\) (9\u202f=\u202f9) \u2192 improper (equal to 1)  \n- \\(\\frac{-12}{8}\\) (|\u201112|\u202f\u2265\u202f8) \u2192 improper (value \u2264\u202f\u20111)  \n\nWhen the numerator is smaller than the denominator (in absolute value), the fraction is called a **proper fraction**."

Since \\(11 > 10\\),\n\n\\[\n\\frac{11}{10} = 1\\frac{1}{10}=1.1,\n\\]\n\nwhich is greater than 1. Therefore, \\(\\frac{11}{10}\\) is classified as an improper fraction."
