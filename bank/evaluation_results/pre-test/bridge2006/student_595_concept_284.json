      "student_answer": "To show the integer\u202f5 as a difference of two **positive** integers on a number line, choose any two positive numbers whose subtraction gives\u202f5.  \n\nOne simple choice is  \n\n\\[\n8 \\;-\\; 3 \\;=\\; 5 .\n\\]\n\n**How it looks on the number line**\n\n```\n0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n                ^           ^\n                3           8\n```\n\n- Mark the point **3** on the line (the \u201cstarting\u201d integer).  \n- Mark the point **8** on the line (the \u201cending\u201d integer).  \n- The distance you move to the right from 3 to 8 is **5 units**.\n\nThus the integer\u202f5 is represented as the difference \\(8-3\\) of the two positive integers 8 and 3 on the number line.

      "question": "Explain how to find the difference between two positive integers on a number line.",
      "student_answer": "To find the difference between two positive integers on a number line you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Draw (or picture) the number line** and mark the two integers you\u2019re comparing.  \n   For example, let the numbers be\u202f4\u202fand\u202f9.\n\n2. **Identify the smaller number** \u2013 in the example it\u2019s\u202f4.  \n   This will be your starting point.\n\n3. **Count the unit jumps** from the smaller number **up to** the larger one.  \n   Move one step at a time to the right: 4 \u2192\u202f5 \u2192\u202f6 \u2192\u202f7 \u2192\u202f8 \u2192\u202f9.  \n\n4. **Count how many jumps you made**.  \n   The number of jumps is the difference between the two integers.  \n   (In the example you made\u202f5\u202fjumps, so\u202f9\u202f\u2013\u202f4\u202f=\u202f5.)\n\n5. **(Common slip)** Some students accidentally **include the starting point** in the count, which adds one extra unit.  \n   Remember you only count the spaces **between** the numbers, not the numbers themselves.\n\nSo, the difference is simply the number of unit steps you travel from the smaller integer to the larger one on the number line. This visual method matches the algebraic subtraction \u201clarger\u202f\u2013\u202fsmaller.\u201d"

      "student_answer": "Subtraction is exactly the operation that tells us how far apart two numbers are on a straight\u2011line picture.  \n\n1. **Place the integers.**  \n   Put the first positive integer\u202f\\(a\\) on the line and, a little farther to the right, the second integer\u202f\\(b\\) (if \\(b>a\\)).  \n\n2. **Count the steps.**  \n   The number of equally\u2011spaced \u201cticks\u2019\u2019 you must move from \\(a\\) to reach \\(b\\) is the *difference* between the two numbers.  \n\n3. **Use subtraction.**  \n   That count is the result of the subtraction \\(b-a\\). In other words, **subtracting the left\u2011hand number from the right\u2011hand number gives the length of the segment that separates them**.  \n\n4. **Direction matters.**  \n   If you start at the larger number and go leftwards toward the smaller one, you are still measuring the same distance; the subtraction \\(b-a\\) (or \\(a-b\\) with a negative sign) tells you the size of the jump you need to make.  \n\nSo, on a number line the act of subtracting one positive integer from another is just a convenient way of describing how many unit steps you travel between the two points, i.e., the geometric \u201cdifference\u2019\u2019 of the two positions."
