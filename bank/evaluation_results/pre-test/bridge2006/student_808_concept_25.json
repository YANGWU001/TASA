      "student_answer": "You can line up the two sets of multiples on a straight\u2011line \u201cnumber line\u2019\u2019 and look for the first spot where they meet.\n\n1. Draw a horizontal line and label a few points at regular intervals (for example, 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f10,\u202f12,\u202f14,\u202f\u2026).\n\n2. Starting at 0, make a mark every **2** units (so you\u2019ll have marks at 2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f10,\u202f12,\u202f\u2026).\n\n3. On the same line, starting at 0, make a different\u2011colored mark every **5** units (so you\u2019ll have marks at 5,\u202f10,\u202f15,\u202f20,\u202f\u2026).\n\n4. Scan the line from left to right and see where the two colors line up for the first time.  \n   - The 2\u2011step marks hit 2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f**10**,\u202f12,\u202f\u2026  \n   - The 5\u2011step marks hit 5,\u202f**10**,\u202f15,\u202f\u2026\n\n5. The first common mark is at **10**. That point is the least common multiple of 2 and 5.\n\nSo, by visually \u201cover\u2011lapping\u2019\u2019 the multiples on a number line, you can see that the LCM of 2 and 5 is **10**. (I think this is the usual way to do it; if you tried a different spacing you\u2019d still end up at the same first shared point.)"

      "question": "Why is the LCM of two prime numbers always equal to their product?",
      "student_answer": "The least\u2011common multiple of two **different** prime numbers is just their product because the only positive factor the two numbers share is\u202f1.  \n\nSince a prime has no divisors other than 1 and itself, the two primes cannot have any common factor larger than 1.  Therefore, any common multiple must contain each prime as a factor at least once.  The smallest such number is simply  \n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(p,\\;q)=p\\times q .\n\\]\n\n(If the \u201ctwo primes\u2019\u2019 happen to be the same prime, then the LCM is that prime itself, not the square.)  \n\nSo, basically, because the only common divisor is\u202f1, the least common multiple ends up being the product of the two primes."

      "student_answer": "The least common multiple of 18 and 24 is **72**.\n\n**How the GCF helps**\n\n1. **Find the GCF first**  \n   - Prime\u2011factor 18 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u00b2  \n   - Prime\u2011factor 24 = 2\u00b3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3  \n   - The common factors are one 2 and one 3, so the greatest common factor (GCF) is  \n     \\[\n     \\text{GCF}=2\\times3=6.\n     \\]\n\n2. **Use the relationship between product, GCF, and LCM**  \n   For any two positive integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):\n   \\[\n   a \\times b = \\text{GCF}(a,b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a,b).\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the numbers:\n   \\[\n   18 \\times 24 = 6 \\times \\text{LCM}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for the LCM**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{LCM} = \\frac{18 \\times 24}{6}\n              = \\frac{432}{6}\n              = 72.\n   \\]\n\nSo, by first finding the GCF (6) and then dividing the product of the two numbers (432) by that GCF, we get the LCM, which is 72. \n\n*(I think this method shows why the GCF is useful: it lets us avoid doing a full list of multiples and gives a quick way to compute the LCM.)*"
