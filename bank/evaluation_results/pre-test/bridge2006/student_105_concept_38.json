      "student_answer": "To cut a circle into five identical pieces you need to create five central angles that are each\u202f\\(360^\\circ \u00f7 5 = 72^\\circ\\).  \nHere\u2019s a step\u2011by\u2011step way to do it with just a compass, straightedge and a protractor (or a drawing\u2011software that can measure angles).\n\n1. **Draw the circle and its centre**  \n   - With the compass, draw a circle of any convenient radius.  \n   - Mark the centre point\u202f\\(O\\).\n\n2. **Mark the first radius**  \n   - Draw any radius from the centre to the circumference; call the point where it meets the circle\u202f\\(A\\).  \n   - This line \\(OA\\) will be the reference direction for all the other cuts.\n\n3. **Measure a 72\u00b0 angle**  \n   - Place the protractor\u2019s centre at \\(O\\) and align its 0\u00b0 line with the radius \\(OA\\).  \n   - From the 0\u00b0 mark, count ahead to the 72\u00b0 mark on the protractor and make a small tick on the circle\u2019s edge.  \n   - Label that point \\(B\\).\n\n4. **Draw the second radius**  \n   - Connect \\(O\\) to \\(B\\) with a straight line. This is the second dividing line.\n\n5. **Repeat the step\u2011wise measurement**  \n   - Keep the protractor centred at \\(O\\). Align the 0\u00b0 line now with the radius \\(OB\\).  \n   - Again mark a point 72\u00b0 further around the circle; label it \\(C\\).  \n   - Draw the radius \\(OC\\).\n\n6. **Continue until you have five points**  \n   - From \\(OC\\) mark another 72\u00b0 to get point \\(D\\) and draw \\(OD\\).  \n   - From \\(OD\\) mark a final 72\u00b0 to get point \\(E\\) and draw \\(OE\\).  \n   - After the fifth step you will have returned to the original point \\(A\\) (because \\(5 \u00d7 72\u00b0 = 360\u00b0\\)).\n\n7. **Check the sections**  \n   - The five radii \\(OA, OB, OC, OD,\\) and \\(OE\\) now split the circle into five \u201cpizza\u2011slice\u201d sectors.  \n   - Each sector has the same central angle (72\u00b0) and the same area because all share the same radius.\n\n**Alternative (no protractor) method \u2013 using a compass:**  \nIf a protractor isn\u2019t available, you can use a compass\u2011only construction based on the fact that a regular pentagon inscribed in the circle gives the needed division points.  \n1. Draw any chord \\(AB\\).  \n2. With the compass set to the length of \\(AB\\), step around the circle, marking off arcs of the same length; after five steps you return to the start, producing points \\(A, B, C, D, E\\).  \n3. Connect each point to the centre \\(O\\). The resulting five radii are exactly the 72\u00b0 divisions.\n\nEither way, the circle is now divided into **five equal sections**."

Repeat until you return to the starting line.\n\n5. **Check the work** \u2013 After the last radius is drawn, you should have completed a full 360\u00b0 turn; the number of radii drawn equals the number of equal sections.\n\n---\n\n### Calculation for 9 Equal Divisions\n\n\\[\n\\text{Central angle} = \\frac{360^{\\circ}}{9} = 40^{\\circ}\n\\]\n\nSo each of the nine sectors will have a central angle of **40 degrees**.  \n\n**Procedure in practice**\n\n- Draw radius \\(OA\\).  \n- Place the protractor\u2019s centre mark at \\(O\\) and the 0\u00b0 line along \\(OA\\).  \n- Mark a point on the circumference at 40\u00b0. Connect this point to \\(O\\) \u2013 that\u2019s radius \\(OB\\).  \n- Continue: 80\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 160\u00b0, 200\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 280\u00b0, 320\u00b0, and finally back to 0\u00b0/360\u00b0.  \n\nYou will end up with nine equal slices, each covering 40\u00b0 of the circle."
