      "student_answer": "To show the integer\u202f3 on a number line you would:\n\n1. **Draw a horizontal line** and mark a point for 0 (the origin).  \n2. **Add equally\u2011spaced tick marks** to the right of 0 for the positive integers: 1, 2, 3, \u2026 (you can also add marks to the left for negative numbers, but they aren\u2019t needed for this task).  \n3. **Place a solid dot or a closed circle** on the tick mark that is labeled \u201c3\u201d.  \n4. (Optional) **Label the dot** with the number 3 or write \u201c3\u201d above it to make it clear.\n\nSo the picture would look something like this (schematically):\n\n```\n---|---|---|---|---|--->\n   0   1   2   3   4\n           \u25cf\n```\n\nThe closed dot at the position labeled \u201c3\u201d represents the number\u202f3 on the number line."

      "question": "Explain how positive integers are represented on a number line.",
      "student_answer": "Positive integers are shown on a number line by starting at\u202f0 and moving to the right.  \nEach \u201cstep\u2019\u2019 of one unit corresponds to the next integer, so:\n\n* 1 is one unit to the right of 0,  \n* 2 is two units to the right of 0 (or one unit to the right of\u202f1),  \n* 3 is three units to the right of\u202f0, and so on.\n\nIn other words, you can think of the distance from 0 to the point that marks a number\u202fn as\u202fn\u202funits.  \nUsually we draw a short tick\u2011mark at every integer position and label it with the integer (the labels are often written above the line).  \n\nThe spacing between any two consecutive positive integers is the same as the spacing between any two consecutive negative integers \u2013 each step is just one unit long.  \n\nSo, to represent a positive integer on the line you start at 0 and count that many equal\u2011sized steps to the right, then mark the point (often with a closed dot) and write the integer\u2019s value next to it."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Why is it important to use number lines to represent positive integers?",
      "student_answer": "Using a number line to show positive integers is useful because it lets us **see how big each number is** and **compare one number to another**.  When the numbers are placed in order on a line, it\u2019s easy to tell which one comes before or after another, which helps with counting, ordering, and basic operations like addition (you can \u201cjump forward\u201d the right number of steps).\n\nA number line also gives a **visual way to understand concepts such as distance** \u2013 the distance between 3 and\u202f7 is the same as the distance between 1 and\u202f5, because both are four units apart.  That visual cue can make later ideas about subtraction, differences, and even simple fractions easier to grasp.\n\nI think another reason is that number lines help with **place\u2011value**.  By marking each integer at evenly spaced points, you can see that the \u201cstep\u201d from 1 to\u202f2 is the same size as from 10 to\u202f11, which reinforces the idea that each integer is exactly one unit apart.\n\nProbably the biggest benefit is that they **provide a concrete picture** for something that\u2019s otherwise abstract, so students can \u201csee\u201d the numbers instead of just hearing the symbols.\n\n*(One thing I\u2019m not sure about is whether number lines are also used to show only negative numbers \u2013 I think they can show negatives too, but the main point here is about positive integers.)*"
