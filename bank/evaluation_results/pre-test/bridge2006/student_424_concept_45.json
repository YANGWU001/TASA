  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of counting shaded parts in most cases. However, there were errors in questions 3, 4, and 9, where the focus on contiguous shaded parts was missed or misinterpreted. It's important to pay attention to the specific wording of the questions to ensure accurate answers.",
