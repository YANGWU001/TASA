  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of calculating differences with negative integers, correctly applying the concept of subtracting negatives as addition in most cases. The only error was in the last question regarding the interpretation of the temperature change, where the absolute value of the difference should have been stated. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the topic.",

      "question": "Explain in your own words why subtracting a negative integer is equivalent to adding its absolute value.",
      "student_answer": "Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding its absolute value because of how the minus sign works.  \n\nWhen we write \u201c\u2011\u202f(\u20115)\u201d we are telling ourselves to take away a quantity that is already a loss of 5. Removing a loss is equivalent to gaining that amount. In other words, the double negative cancels out, turning the operation into addition:  \n\n\\[\na - (-b) = a + b\n\\]\n\nHere\u202f\\(b\\) is the absolute value (the non\u2011negative size) of the original negative integer. So instead of thinking \u201csubtract a negative,\u201d we can simply add the positive version of that number, which is its absolute value. This is why the two operations give the same result."

      "student_answer": "The difference is  \n\n\\[\n-15 - (-10) = -15 + 10 = -5.\n\\]\n\nSo the result is **\u20115**."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How does the operation 3 - (-7) differ from 3 + 7?",
      "student_answer": "The two expressions actually give the same numerical result, but they are written in different ways.\n\n* **3\u202f\u2212\u202f(\u22127)** means \u201csubtract a negative seven.\u201d  \n  When you subtract a negative, the two minus signs combine to become a plus, so  \n  \\[\n  3\u202f\u2212\u202f(\u22127)=3+7=10.\n  \\]\n\n* **3\u202f+\u202f7** is simply \u201cadd seven\u201d to three, which also equals 10.\n\nSo the **difference** is not in the value (both equal\u202f10) but in the **operation used**:\n\n- In the first case you have a subtraction of a negative number, which by the sign\u2011rule turns into addition.  \n- In the second case you have a straightforward addition of a positive number.\n\nConceptually, the \u201csubtract\u2011a\u2011negative\u201d form emphasizes the rule that subtracting a negative is the same as adding its positive counterpart. The two expressions are equivalent in result, but they illustrate the sign\u2011rule in different ways."
