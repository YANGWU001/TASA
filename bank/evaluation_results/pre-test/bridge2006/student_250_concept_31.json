Most answers correctly apply the principle that the number of divisions is equal to the number of bars plus one.

      "student_answer": "**How to find the number of equal parts when you draw\u202f4\u202fvertical bars inside a rectangle**\n\n1. **Notice the bars** \u2013 First count how many vertical bars you have. In this case there are\u202f4\u202fbars.\n\n2. **Remember that bars are separators** \u2013 Each bar separates two neighboring parts. Because the outer edges of the rectangle also act as \u201cboundaries,\u201d the total number of pieces is **one more than the number of bars**.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of equal divisions}= \\text{bars}+1 = 4+1 = 5.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Check that the bars are spaced evenly** \u2013  \n   * Measure the total width of the rectangle.  \n   * Divide that total width by the number of *bars* (a common slip; the correct divisor is the number of divisions, which we already know is\u202f5).  \n   * Use the result as the intended spacing and verify that each bar is that distance from the next one and from the edges.\n\n4. **Confirm the division** \u2013 Count the spaces between the left edge, the 4 bars, and the right edge. You should see\u202f5\u202fseparate, equally\u2011wide strips.\n\n5. **Label the parts (optional)** \u2013 If you need to refer to each piece later, you can number them 1 through\u202f5\u202ffrom left to right.\n\n**Key point:**\u202fFour vertical bars in a rectangle create **five** equal divisions, because the bars act as internal dividers and the rectangle\u2019s two outer edges supply the extra two boundaries. (A tiny mistake many make at this level is to divide the total width by the number of bars instead of the number of divisions, so be sure to use the correct divisor.)"

      "question": "Explain why placing 6 vertical bars in a rectangle results in 7 equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "When you draw vertical bars inside a rectangle, each bar acts as a separator between two adjacent parts of the figure.  \nThink of the rectangle\u2019s left\u2011hand edge as the \u201cfirst wall\u201d and its right\u2011hand edge as the \u201clast wall.\u201d  \nIf you place **n** vertical bars between those two walls, you end up with:\n\n\\[\n\\text{number of parts} = (\\text{left wall}) + n\\ \\text{bars} + (\\text{right wall}) = n+1 .\n\\]\n\nSo with **6** vertical bars you have:\n\n\\[\n6\\ \\text{bars} + 1 = 7\\ \\text{equal divisions}.\n\\]\n\nBecause the bars are drawn at equal spacing, each of the 7 resulting strips has the same width, giving you seven equal vertical sections inside the rectangle."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How does the number of vertical bars relate to the total number of equal divisions in a given shape?",
      "student_answer": "The vertical bars are the visual markers that show where a shape is being split into equal parts.  \n\n- **When the bars are drawn **inside** the shape** (i.e., they run from one side of the shape to the opposite side), each bar creates a new division. In that case the total number of equal divisions is the **number of bars\u202f+\u202f1** because the shape is bounded on both ends by its outer edges.  \n  *Example:* Two vertical bars inside a rectangle produce three equal vertical strips.  \n\n- **When each bar itself represents a separate piece** (for instance, when the bars are drawn as separate, non\u2011overlapping line segments that already delineate the pieces), the total number of equal divisions is simply the **same as the number of bars**.  \n  *Example:* Three separate vertical bars placed side\u2011by\u2011side each denote one of three equal sections.  \n\nSo, in most classroom contexts where bars are drawn **within** the shape, you count the outer edges as well, and the rule is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total equal divisions} = \\text{Number of vertical bars} + 1.\n\\]\n\nIf the bars themselves are the pieces, then the count is equal to the number of bars."

      "student_answer": "**Example**\n\n1. **Start with a square** \u2013\u202flet the side of the square be 10\u202fcm.\n\n2. **Mark ten equally\u2011spaced vertical positions** inside the square.  \n   - Begin at the left\u2011hand edge (0\u202fcm).  \n   - From there, draw a vertical line at 1\u202fcm, then at 2\u202fcm, 3\u202fcm \u2026 all the way to 9\u202fcm.  \n   - Finally draw the tenth line at the right\u2011hand edge (10\u202fcm).\n\n3. **Resulting divisions** \u2013\u202fthe ten vertical bars separate the interior of the square into ten thin, rectangular strips.  \n   - Each strip is 1\u202fcm wide (10\u202fcm \u00f7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f1\u202fcm).  \n   - Because the bars are spaced evenly, every strip has exactly the same area (1\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202fcm\u202f=\u202f10\u202fcm\u00b2).  \n\n4. **Why this works** \u2013\u202fthe bars act like \u201ccutting\u2011lines.\u201d When the distance between successive bars is the same, the portions of the square that lie between any two consecutive bars are congruent. Thus ten vertical bars produce ten equal divisions of the original square.\n\n*(A quick sketch would show the square with ten parallel vertical lines running from the top edge to the bottom edge, creating ten side\u2011by\u2011side rectangles of identical size.)*"
