      "question": "What does it mean to represent a fraction as the difference on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "Representing a fraction **as the difference on a number line** means you show the fraction by marking two points on the line and then treating the distance\u202f*between*\u202fthose two points as the value of the fraction.  \n\nIn practice you might start at a convenient reference point (often\u202f0\u202for\u202f1) and then move to another point that is a known distance away. The length of the segment you \u201csubtract\u201d \u2013 the gap between the two marks \u2013 is taken to be the fraction you\u2019re representing. For example, to show\u202f\\( \\frac{3}{4} \\)\u202fas a difference you could mark\u202f1\u202fon the line and then mark a point that is\u202f\\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)\u202fto the left of\u202f1; the distance between those two marks (the difference) is\u202f\\( \\frac{3}{4} \\).  \n\nSo essentially you are expressing the fraction as \u201chow far you have to go from one point to another,\u201d i.e., the difference between the coordinates of the two points on the number line."

      "student_answer": "To find the difference between two fractions on a number line you can use the visual \u201cdistance\u201d between their points.\n\n1. **Draw a number line** that includes 0 and 1 (or a larger interval if the fractions are bigger than 1).  \n2. **Mark the two fractions** on the line.  For example, if the fractions are \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) and \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\), place a point at \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) and another point at \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\).  \n3. **Look at the space between the points.**  The length of that space is the absolute difference of the two fractions.  In the example the distance from \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) to \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) is two \u201ceighth\u2011steps,\u201d so the difference is \\(\\frac{2}{8}\\) (which reduces to \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)).  \n\nIf you need the signed difference (which way you\u2019re going), start at the smaller fraction and **count forward** to the larger one, then write that counted distance as a fraction.  So you would subtract the smaller fraction from the larger one:\n\n\\[\n\\text{difference}= \\text{larger fraction} - \\text{smaller fraction}.\n\\]\n\nIn practice you can also think of the distance as the **sum of the little steps** that separate the two points.  (I think this is the same as subtracting the two fractions; the key idea is that the distance on the line gives you the fraction that represents the difference.)  \n\nFinally, if you want the answer as a reduced fraction, simplify the numerator and denominator in the usual way."
