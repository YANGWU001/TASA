Then I try to take the \u201cbiggest\u201d primes from each list\u2026 I guess I just multiply everything together, so 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f300. \n\nSo, I guess the least common multiple is 300.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of 8 and 12 is **16**.\n\n**How I tried to find it:**\n\n1. First I listed a few multiples of each number.  \n   - Multiples of\u202f8: 8,\u202f16,\u202f24,\u202f32 \u2026  \n   - Multiples of\u202f12: 12,\u202f24,\u202f36,\u202f48 \u2026\n\n2. I looked for a number that showed up in both lists, but I got a little confused and thought I only needed the *smallest* multiple that was *greater than* the two original numbers, not the smallest common one.\n\n3. Since 16 is the first multiple of\u202f8 that\u2019s larger than both 8 and 12, I guessed that might be the answer.\n\n4. I double\u2011checked by trying to divide 16 by 12, and I thought \u201coh, it\u2019s close enough, so it must work.\u201d  \n\nSo, I\u2019m pretty sure the LCM is 16.

      "question": "How can you use a number line to visually determine the LCM of 2 and 5?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d start by drawing a number line and then putting the multiples of the two numbers on it. So you\u2019d mark 2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f10,\u202f12\u2026 for the 2\u2011s, and then 5,\u202f10,\u202f15\u2026 for the 5\u2011s. The first place where the two lists line up is\u2026 maybe 5? I\u2019m not totally sure, but it looks like 5 is the first spot they both hit, so I guess the LCM would be 5. (If that\u2019s not right, I guess you could try checking the next common point.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Why is the LCM of two prime numbers always equal to their product?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of two prime numbers is just their product because prime numbers are always multiples of each other. Since each prime can be divided by the other one, the smallest number that both can go into is just the two numbers added together, which happens to be the same as multiplying them. So the LCM ends up being the product of the two primes. (I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of 18 and 24 is\u2026 maybe 96?  \n\nTo try to get it, I first looked for the greatest common factor. I figured the GCF was 6 (since 18\u202f=\u202f6\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 and 24\u202f=\u202f6\u202f\u00d7\u202f4). Then I tried to \u201cmultiply the GCF by the two numbers\u201d or something like that. I did 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f18\u202f=\u202f108 and 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f24\u202f=\u202f144, and then I kind of guessed a number that seemed to be a common multiple of both, and 96 kind of popped into my head because it\u2019s a multiple of 24 (24\u202f\u00d7\u202f4) and also a multiple of 18 (18\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f90, but 96 is close).  \n\nSo I\u2019m not really sure why 96 works, but I think because the GCF is 6, you can use it to help find the LCM by\u2026 maybe dividing each number by the GCF and then multiplying the results together? If you do that: 18\u202f\u00f7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f3 and 24\u202f\u00f7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f4, then 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f12, and then multiply back by the GCF: 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f72\u2026 wait, that gives 72, which I think is actually the correct LCM.  \n\nBut I\u2019m pretty confused, so I\u2019ll stick with my first guess: the LCM is **96**. \n\n*(Sorry, I\u2019m not confident about this.)*"
