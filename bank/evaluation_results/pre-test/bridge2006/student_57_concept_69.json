    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the multiplier if a rectangle has a length of 8 and the width is doubled?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier is **2**.  Doubling the width doubles the area, so the new area is twice the original."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a rectangle\u2019s length is multiplied by 3, what is the new length if the original length was 5?",
      "student_answer": "The new length is \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "A rectangle\u2019s area is increased by multiplying its length by 4. What is the multiplier applied to the length?",
      "student_answer": "The length is multiplied by **4**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "The width of a rectangle is tripled. What does the multiplier represent in this case?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier (\u202f3\u202f) is the **scale factor** for the width.  \nIt tells us that the rectangle\u2019s width is being increased to three times its original size \u2013 i.e., the width is multiplied by\u202f3."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If the dimensions of a rectangle are multiplied by 2, what happens to the area of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "When the length and width of a rectangle are each multiplied by\u202f2, the new area becomes  \n\n\\[\n\\text{new area}= (2\\cdot\\text{length})\\times(2\\cdot\\text{width}) = 4 \\times (\\text{length}\\times\\text{width}),\n\\]\n\nso the area is multiplied by **4** (it becomes four\u202ftimes larger)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A rectangle has a width of 6 meters. The width is multiplied by a factor of 5. What is the new width?",
      "student_answer": "The new width is  \n\n\\[\n6 \\text{ meters} \\times 5 = 30 \\text{ meters}.\n\\]"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the multiplier used if a rectangle\u2019s width is reduced to half its original size?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier is **\u00bd** (or\u202f0.5)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is multiplied by 7, how does the multiplier affect the perimeter of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "When the length\u202f\\(L\\) of a rectangle is multiplied by\u202f7, only the part of the perimeter that comes from the length changes.\n\nThe original perimeter is  \n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{original}} = 2(L + W)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(W\\) is the width.\n\nAfter the length is multiplied by 7, the new length is \\(7L\\) and the new perimeter is  \n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{new}} = 2(7L + W) = 14L + 2W.\n\\]\n\nCompare this with the original perimeter:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{original}} = 2L + 2W.\n\\]\n\nThe width\u2011contribution \\(2W\\) stays the same, while the length\u2011contribution changes from \\(2L\\) to \\(14L\\).  \n\nSo the perimeter increases by  \n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{new}} - P_{\\text{original}} = (14L + 2W) - (2L + 2W) = 12L.\n\\]\n\nIn other words, the portion of the perimeter that comes from the length is multiplied by 7, causing the overall perimeter to grow by an extra \\(12L\\)."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A rectangle\u2019s dimensions are scaled by multiplying both length and width by 3. What is the multiplier for each dimension?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier applied to each dimension (both the length and the width) is **3**."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "The area of a rectangle is doubled by changing the width. What multiplier was applied to the width?",
      "student_answer": "The width must be multiplied by **2**."
