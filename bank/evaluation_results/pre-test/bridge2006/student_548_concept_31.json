      "student_answer": "**Answer: 4 equal divisions**\n\n**Explanation:**  \nWhen vertical bars are spaced evenly, each bar acts as a separator between two adjacent sections. With 3 vertical bars, the spaces are:  \n\n- before the first bar,  \n- between the 1st and 2nd bars,  \n- between the 2nd and 3rd bars,  \n- after the third bar.  \n\nThus, the three bars divide the grid into **four** equal vertical divisions."

      "question": "Describe the process to determine the number of equal divisions when using 4 vertical bars in a rectangular shape.",
      "student_answer": "**Step\u2011by\u2011step process**\n\n1. **Draw the rectangle** \u2013 Start with a clean, straight\u2011edged rectangle that will be divided vertically.\n\n2. **Measure the total width** \u2013 Use a ruler (or any consistent measuring tool) to find the distance from the left side of the rectangle to the right side. Call this distance *W*.\n\n3. **Decide how many bars you will place** \u2013 In this case you have **4 vertical bars**.\n\n4. **Calculate the width of each equal section** \u2013  \n   When *n* vertical bars are inserted, they create *n\u202f+\u202f1* equal strips.  \n   So with 4 bars you will end up with **5 equal divisions**.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Width of one division} = \\frac{W}{5}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Mark the division points** \u2013 Starting at the left edge, make a small tick or light line every *W\u202f/\u202f5* units. You will make four interior ticks (the positions of the bars) and you already have the two outer edges, giving you five equal widths.\n\n6. **Draw the vertical bars** \u2013 At each of the four interior tick marks, draw a straight vertical line from the top edge of the rectangle down to the bottom edge. These are your 4 vertical bars.\n\n7. **Count the resulting sections** \u2013 After the bars are drawn you will see five rectangular strips side\u2011by\u2011side. Because the bars were placed at equal intervals, each strip has the same width, confirming that you have **5 equal divisions**.\n\n8. **Check your work** \u2013 Verify that the distance between any two adjacent bars (or between a bar and the rectangle\u2019s edge) is exactly *W\u202f/\u202f5*. If all five gaps are identical, the division is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Result:** Using 4 vertical bars in a rectangle creates **5 equal vertical divisions**. The key is to divide the total width by the number of expected sections (bars\u202f+\u202f1) and then place the bars at those evenly spaced intervals."

      "question": "If a rectangle is divided by 5 evenly spaced vertical bars, how many equal sections are formed?",
      "student_answer": "The 5 evenly\u2011spaced vertical bars divide the rectangle into **6 equal sections**."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain why placing 6 vertical bars in a rectangle results in 7 equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "When you draw vertical bars inside a rectangle, each bar serves as a border between two **adjacent sections**.  \n\n1. **First bar** \u2013 separates the left\u2011most part of the rectangle from the rest.  \n2. **Second bar** \u2013 creates a new section between the first and second bars.  \n3. **Third bar** \u2013 creates another section between the second and third bars.  \n\n\u2026and so on, until the **sixth bar**.  \n\nBecause the bars are spaced **equally**, the spaces on the outside of the outermost bars are the same width as the spaces between the bars. Thus the total number of sections is:\n\n- one section **to the left of the first bar**,  \n- one section **between each pair of neighboring bars** (there are \\(6-1 = 5\\) such gaps),  \n- one section **to the right of the sixth bar**.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n\\[\n1 \\;(\\text{left}) \\;+\\; 5 \\;(\\text{between bars}) \\;+\\; 1 \\;(\\text{right}) \\;=\\; 7\n\\]\n\nTherefore, six equally\u2011spaced vertical bars divide the rectangle into **seven equal vertical divisions**."

      "question": "How does the number of vertical bars relate to the total number of equal divisions in a given shape?",
      "student_answer": "The vertical bars are used as visual \u201ccut\u2011lines\u201d that show how a shape is being split into equal parts.  \n\n* **Each bar marks a boundary between two neighboring pieces.**  \n* Therefore, if you see **\u202fn\u202f** vertical bars drawn inside a shape, the shape is actually divided into **\u202fn\u202f+\u202f1\u202f** equal sections.  \n\n(If the bars themselves are meant to represent the pieces rather than the boundaries, then the number of equal divisions is simply the number of bars. In most classroom illustrations, however, the bars are the separators, so you add one to get the total number of equal parts.)"

      "student_answer": "The rectangle is split into\u202f8\u202fequal vertical sections.\u202fTo get\u202f8\u202fsections you need one fewer dividing line than the number of sections, so the number of vertical bars used is:\n\n\\[\n8 \\text{ sections} - 1 = 7 \\text{ vertical bars}\n\\]\n\n**Answer: 7**"

      "question": "Illustrate with an example how placing 10 vertical bars in a square creates multiple equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "Imagine a square that is 110\u202fcm on each side.  \nNow draw **10 vertical bars** inside the square so that the distance from the left edge of the square to the first bar, the distance between any two neighboring bars, and the distance from the last bar to the right edge are all the same.\n\nBecause the total width of the square is 110\u202fcm and we are dividing it into equal pieces, the spacing between successive \u201cboundaries\u2019\u2019 (the left edge, each bar, and the right edge) must be  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{110\\text{\u202fcm}}{11}=10\\text{\u202fcm}.\n\\]\n\nSo we place the bars at the following x\u2011coordinates (measured from the left side of the square):\n\n- 10\u202fcm, 20\u202fcm, 30\u202fcm, 40\u202fcm, 50\u202fcm, 60\u202fcm, 70\u202fcm, 80\u202fcm, 90\u202fcm, and 100\u202fcm.\n\nThese are the 10 vertical bars.  \n\nThe **result** is that the square is now split into **11 vertical strips**, each 10\u202fcm wide. Every strip is exactly the same size, so the division is \u201cequal\u2019\u2019 throughout the square.\n\nIn short, putting 10 equally\u2011spaced vertical bars inside a square creates 11 equal vertical divisions, and the example above shows how the spacing works in a concrete, measurable way."
