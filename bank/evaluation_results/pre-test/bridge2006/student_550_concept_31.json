      "student_answer": "**Step\u2011by\u2011step process**\n\n1. **Draw the rectangle** \u2013 Sketch the outline of the shape you will be dividing.\n\n2. **Mark equally\u2011spaced points on the top edge** \u2013  \n   \u2022 Divide the top side into the same number of segments that you want the rectangle to be split into.  \n   \u2022 Since you will be using\u202f4 vertical bars, you need **5** equal sections (one more section than the number of bars).  \n   \u2022 Place a small tick\u2011mark at each division point, including the two corners.\n\n3. **Copy the marks to the bottom edge** \u2013  \n   \u2022 Using a ruler, draw vertical dotted lines from each top tick\u2011mark straight down to the bottom edge.  \n   \u2022 The bottom marks should line up exactly with the top marks, guaranteeing that the bars will be parallel and evenly spaced.\n\n4. **Draw the 4 vertical bars** \u2013  \n   \u2022 Connect each pair of corresponding top\u2011and\u2011bottom marks with a straight vertical line.  \n   \u2022 These are your **4 vertical bars**. Because the tick\u2011marks were equally spaced, the bars are equally spaced too.\n\n5. **Count the resulting equal divisions** \u2013  \n   \u2022 The rectangle is now divided into **5 equal vertical strips**: one strip is formed between the left edge of the rectangle and the first bar, one between each pair of consecutive bars, and one between the last bar and the right edge.  \n   \u2022 In general, **Number of equal divisions = (Number of vertical bars)\u202f+\u202f1**.\n\n6. **Check the spacing (optional but recommended)** \u2013  \n   \u2022 Measure the width of each strip with a ruler. All five widths should be the same; if not, adjust the placement of the bars until they are.\n\n---\n\n### Quick formula\n\nIf you have **n** vertical bars placed inside a rectangle, the rectangle is divided into **n\u202f+\u202f1** equal vertical sections, provided the bars are spaced uniformly.  \n\nFor **n\u202f=\u202f4**, the rectangle is split into **4\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f5** equal divisions."

      "question": "Explain why placing 6 vertical bars in a rectangle results in 7 equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "When we draw vertical bars inside a rectangle, the bars act as **boundaries** that separate the rectangle into distinct vertical strips.  \n\n1. **Start with no bars.**  \n   The whole rectangle is one single region \u2013 we have **1 division**.\n\n2. **Add the first vertical bar.**  \n   The bar splits the rectangle into a strip on its left and a strip on its right.  \n   Now we have **2 divisions** (left of the bar + right of the bar).\n\n3. **Add a second vertical bar.**  \n   This new bar creates one additional strip \u2013 it falls between the two existing strips, so the total becomes **3 divisions**.\n\n4. **Continue this process.**  \n   Every time we insert another vertical bar, it introduces exactly one new strip: it sits between two existing strips (or at the edge) and therefore adds **one more division**.\n\nMathematically, the number of divisions equals the number of bars **plus one**:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Divisions} = \\text{Bars} + 1.\n\\]\n\nSo with **6 vertical bars**:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Divisions} = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\\]\n\nWe can also count the divisions directly:\n\n- One division to the left of the first bar,\n- One division between each pair of consecutive bars (there are \\(6-1 = 5\\) such gaps),\n- One division to the right of the last bar.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n\\[\n1\\ (\\text{left}) + 5\\ (\\text{gaps}) + 1\\ (\\text{right}) = 7\\ \\text{equal vertical divisions}.\n\\]\n\nThus, placing six equally\u2011spaced vertical bars inside a rectangle divides the rectangle into seven equal vertical sections."

      "question": "How does the number of vertical bars relate to the total number of equal divisions in a given shape?",
      "student_answer": "The vertical bars act as the **boundaries** that separate a shape into equal parts.  \nEach bar marks the line where one part ends and the next one begins.  \n\nBecause the first part starts at the left\u2011most edge of the shape (with no bar before it) and the last part ends at the right\u2011most edge (with no bar after it), the total number of equal divisions is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of equal divisions} = (\\text{Number of vertical bars}) + 1\n\\]\n\n**Example**  \nIf a rectangle has three vertical bars drawn inside it, the bars create four equal sections:\n\n- Bar\u202f1 separates section\u202f1 from section\u202f2  \n- Bar\u202f2 separates section\u202f2 from section\u202f3  \n- Bar\u202f3 separates section\u202f3 from section\u202f4  \n\nThus, 3 bars \u2192 4 equal divisions.\n\nSo, in general, count the vertical bars and add one to obtain the total number of equal parts."

      "student_answer": "**Example \u2013 10 vertical bars inside a square**\n\n1. **Start with a square** \u2013 say the square has a side\u2011length of **10\u202fcm**.\n\n2. **Place the vertical bars** \u2013 draw 10 thin, equally\u2011spaced vertical lines (the \u201cbars\u201d) from the top edge to the bottom edge of the square.\n\n   * Because there are 10 bars, they create **11 vertical slices** (the spaces\u202f+\u202fthe two outer edges).\n   * The distance between any two consecutive bars (or between a bar and the nearest side of the square) must be the same.  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Width of each slice}=\\frac{\\text{side length}}{10+1}\n     =\\frac{10\\text{\u202fcm}}{11}\\approx0.91\\text{\u202fcm}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Resulting equal divisions** \u2013 the square is now divided into **11 vertical rectangles** that are all identical in width (\u22480.91\u202fcm) and height (10\u202fcm).  \n\n   ![Sketch]  \n   ```\n   +-----------------------------------+\n   | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n   |   11 equal vertical strips       |\n   +-----------------------------------+\n   ```\n\n4. **How \u201cmultiple\u201d equal divisions appear** \u2013 each of the 11 vertical strips can be further subdivided (for example, by adding horizontal bars).  \n   * If we add **4 horizontal bars** equally spaced, each strip will be cut into **5 horizontal bands**.  \n   * Consequently, the whole square will contain **11\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f55** small rectangles, all of exactly the same size (\u22480.91\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fcm).\n\n**Key point:** By placing 10 vertical bars equally spaced across a square, we automatically produce **11 equal vertical divisions**. Adding additional sets of equally\u2011spaced bars (horizontal, diagonal, etc.) multiplies the number of equal pieces, illustrating how just a few well\u2011placed bars can generate many equal parts."
