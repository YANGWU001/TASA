  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of comparing sums, correctly identifying larger quantities in most cases. However, there were errors in Questions 1, 2, and 5, indicating some confusion with basic addition and comparison. Overall, the student shows promise but should double-check calculations to avoid mistakes.",
