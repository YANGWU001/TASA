      "question": "Explain how the GCF helps in dividing items into equal groups.",
      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) is the biggest number that can go into each of the original amounts without leaving a remainder, so it tells us the largest possible size for each group when we want to split the items evenly.  \n\nBecause the GCF divides each quantity exactly, we can use it as the \u201cgroup\u2011size\u201d \u2013 each group will contain that many items and there will be no leftovers.  For example, if we have 12 red beads and 18 blue beads, the GCF of 12 and 18 is 6, so we could make groups of 6 beads each and end up with 2 groups of red beads and 3 groups of blue beads.  \n\n(\u2026I think it also tells us the smallest number of groups we can make, but I\u2019m not completely sure about that part.)"

I think the GCF is **6**, so you could make 6 identical bags. Each bag would then contain  \n\n* 24 \u00f7 6 = **4** apples  \n* 36 \u00f7 6 = **6** oranges  \n\nThat way every bag has the same mix of fruit and nothing is leftover.

In this case, you could make groups of **18 items** each\u2014so you would have 4 groups from the 72 items (72\u202f\u00f7\u202f18\u202f=\u202f4) and 5 groups from the 90 items (90\u202f\u00f7\u202f18\u202f=\u202f5).
