      "student_answer": "I think the greatest common factor of 12 and 18 is **4**.  \n\nTo find it, I tried listing the factors of each number.  \n- Factors of 12: 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f12  \n- Factors of 18: 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f18  \n\nThen I looked for the largest number that appears in both lists. The biggest one I noticed in both lists was 4, so that should be the GCF. (I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014I might have missed a larger common factor.)"

      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor of 24 and 36 is 12.  \nSo you can make **12 equal groups**, each containing 2 apples (24\u202f\u00f7\u202f12) and 3 oranges (36\u202f\u00f7\u202f12)."

      "question": "Explain how the GCF helps in dividing items into equal groups.",
      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) tells you the biggest size that each group can have when you want to split a collection of objects into equal piles with no leftovers.  \n\nFor example, if you have 12 apples and 18 oranges and you want to make the same\u2011size fruit baskets, you look for the GCF of 12 and 18.  The GCF is 6, so you can make baskets that each contain 6 pieces of fruit (or 6 apples and 6 oranges together) and you\u2019ll use up all the items without anything left over.  \n\nIn general, you first list the factors of each number, then pick the largest one they share \u2013 that\u2019s the GCF.  That number becomes the size of each group (or the number of groups, depending on how you set it up), guaranteeing that the items can be divided evenly.  \n\nI think the GCF can also be used to find the smallest possible group size, but the main idea is that it gives you the largest equal\u2011sized groups you can form without any remainder."

      "student_answer": "I think the greatest common factor of 45 and\u202f60 is 15.  \nSo if we make groups that each contain 15 items, the 45 items would be split into about **4 groups** and the 60 items would be split into about **3 groups**.  (Each group would have 15 items.)"

      "question": "What is the GCF of 16, 24, and 40? How many groups can be formed with this GCF?",
      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor of the three numbers is  \n\n\\[\n\\gcd(16,\\;24,\\;40)=8 .\n\\]\n\nSo each group would contain **8 items**.  \n\nDividing each original collection by 8 tells you how many such groups you can make:\n\n- From 16 you can make \\(16 \u00f7 8 = 2\\) groups.  \n- From 24 you can make \\(24 \u00f7 8 = 3\\) groups.  \n- From 40 you can make \\(40 \u00f7 8 = 5\\) groups.  \n\nThus the GCF is 8, and you can form 2 groups from the 16 items, 3 groups from the 24 items, and 5 groups from the 40 items."

      "student_answer": "I think the greatest common factor of\u202f50\u202fand\u202f30\u202fmight be\u202f5, so each group would contain about **5 items** (giving you roughly 10 groups of pencils and 6 groups of erasers)."

      "student_answer": "Imagine you have a classroom that needs to set up tables for a group activity.  \nYou have 18 red chairs and 24 blue chairs, and you want to arrange them into identical sets so that each set has the same number of red chairs and the same number of blue chairs and there are no chairs left over.  \n\nYou would find the greatest common factor of 18 and 24.  The GCF is 12, so you could make 12 identical groups.  Each group would contain\u202f1.5\u202fred chairs and\u202f2\u202fblue chairs.  \n\nIn this way, the GCF tells you how many groups you can create that use all the chairs without any leftovers."

      "student_answer": "I think the greatest common factor (GCF) of 72 and 90 is **18**.\n\nWhat this means in terms of grouping items is that 18 is the largest number of items you could put in each group so that **both** 72 items and 90 items can be divided evenly into those groups.  \n\n- With 72 items you could make \\(72 \u00f7 18 = 4\\) groups of 18.  \n- With 90 items you could make \\(90 \u00f7 18 = 5\\) groups of 18.  \n\nSo the GCF tells you the biggest possible group size that works for both numbers without any leftovers."
