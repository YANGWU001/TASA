      "question": "What does it mean to 'multiply through' in the context of simplifying equations?",
      "student_answer": "\u201cMultiplying through\u201d means applying the same multiplication to **every term on both sides of an equation**\u2014usually to get rid of fractions or to distribute a factor.  \n\nFor example, if you have  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{2x}{5}=3,\n\\]\n\nyou can \u201cmultiply through\u201d by the denominator\u202f5, giving  \n\n\\[\n5\\cdot\\frac{2x}{5}=5\\cdot3\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;2x=15.\n\\]\n\nThe same idea works with a factor that\u2019s already outside parentheses:  \n\n\\[\n3(2x+4)=9 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; 3\\cdot2x + 3\\cdot4 = 9 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; 6x+12=9.\n\\]\n\nIn short, multiplying through eliminates denominators or expands a product so the equation is easier to solve."

      "student_answer": "Multiplying both sides of an inequality by a negative number reverses the direction of the inequality sign.  \nFor example, if \\(a < b\\) and you multiply by \\(-3\\), the inequality becomes \\(-3a > -3b\\). The same reversal applies to \u201c\\(\\le\\)\u201d becoming \u201c\\(\\ge\\)\u201d and vice\u202fversa."

      "question": "Why is it important to distribute multiplication across all terms in parentheses when performing multiply through?",
      "student_answer": "When we \u201cmultiply through,\u201d we are applying the distributive property of multiplication over addition (and subtraction):\n\n\\[\na(b + c) = ab + ac \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad a(b - c) = ab - ac .\n\\]\n\nDistributing the multiplication to **every** term inside the parentheses is crucial because:\n\n1. **Preserves Equality**  \n   The original expression and the expanded form must represent the same quantity. Skipping a term would change the value, breaking the equality.\n\n2. **Ensures Correct Coefficients**  \n   Each term inside the parentheses is multiplied by the same factor. If one term isn\u2019t multiplied, its coefficient stays too small (or unchanged), leading to an incorrect result.\n\n3. **Prevents Hidden Errors in Later Steps**  \n   An incomplete distribution can cause mistakes when you later combine like terms, solve equations, or simplify expressions. Those errors propagate and become harder to spot.\n\n4. **Follows the Fundamental Distributive Law**  \n   Mathematics relies on well\u2011defined operations. The distributive law guarantees that multiplying a sum (or difference) by a number is equivalent to multiplying each addend (or subtrahend) individually and then adding (or subtracting) the results.\n\nIn short, distributing across all terms guarantees that the transformed expression is mathematically equivalent to the original, keeping calculations accurate and reliable."

      "question": "How does multiplying through help in solving algebraic equations? Provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Multiplying through means multiplying every term in an equation by the same number (or expression) so that denominators disappear or the equation becomes simpler.  \n\n**Why it helps**  \n* It removes fractions or radicals that can make the algebra messy.  \n* It produces an equivalent equation\u2014so the solutions are unchanged\u2014but in a form that is easier to isolate the variable.  \n* Once the equation is cleared of denominators, you can apply the usual steps (combine like terms, isolate the variable) without worrying about hidden restrictions.\n\n**Example**\n\nSolve  \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}x + 4 = 7 .\n\\]\n\n1. Identify the denominator\u202f\u2014\u202fthe fraction has a denominator of\u202f3.  \n2.
