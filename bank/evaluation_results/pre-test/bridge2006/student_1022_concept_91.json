      "question": "What does it mean to represent a fraction as the difference on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "Representing a fraction as a **difference** on a number line means showing that fraction as the distance (the length of a segment) between two points that you already know how to locate.  \n\nIn practice you pick two numbers on the line whose positions are easy to mark\u2014often whole numbers or fractions you already have plotted. The fraction you\u2019re interested in is then expressed as the subtraction (difference) of those two numbers, and the length of the segment joining them equals the fraction.\n\n**Example**\n\nSuppose you want to represent\u202f\\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) on a number line. You can mark the points\u202f\\(0\\),\u202f\\( \\frac{1}{4} \\),\u202f\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\),\u202f\\( \\frac{3}{4} \\), and\u202f\\(1\\).  \n\nInstead of locating \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) directly, you can think of it as the difference between \\(1\\) and \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4}=1-\\frac{1}{4}.\n\\]\n\nOn the number line you draw a segment from the point \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) up to the point \\(1\\). The length of that segment is exactly \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\). Thus the fraction has been represented as the **difference** between two known points.\n\nSo, representing a fraction as a difference on a number line is a way of visualizing the fraction as \u201chow far apart\u201d two points are, using subtraction to describe that distance. This can be especially helpful when the fraction is easier to think of as the gap between two more familiar numbers."

      "student_answer": "To show\u202f\\( \\dfrac{2}{5} \\)\u202fas a **difference** between two points on a number line you can do the following:\n\n1. **Draw a number line** that is divided into fifth\u2011s (\u202f\\( \\frac{1}{5} \\)\u202f) steps.  \n   Mark the points  \n\n\\[\n0,\\; \\frac{1}{5},\\; \\frac{2}{5},\\; \\frac{3}{5},\\; \\frac{4}{5},\\; 1\n\\]\n\n2. **Pick two of those marks whose distance apart is exactly two fifths.**  \n   Two easy choices are:\n\n   * \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\)\u202fand\u202f\\( \\frac{1}{5} \\)  \n   * \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\)\u202fand\u202f\\( \\frac{2}{5} \\)\n\n3. **Read the difference** between the larger and the smaller point:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5} - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{2}{5}\\qquad\\text{or}\\qquad \n\\frac{4}{5} - \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\n4. **Interpretation on the line:**  \n   The segment that starts at \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) and ends at \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) (or the one from \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) to \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\)) has length \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\).  \n\nSo, the fraction\u202f\\( \\dfrac{2}{5} \\)\u202fcan be represented as the difference between two other fractions on the number line\u2014most simply as  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}= \\frac{3}{5}-\\frac{1}{5}}\n\\] \n\n(or equivalently \\( \\frac{4}{5}-\\frac{2}{5} \\))."

      "student_answer": "To use a number line to find the difference between two fractions, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Draw a number line with convenient marks** \u2013 Choose a scale that makes both fractions land on printed \u201cticks.\u201d  \n   *A good way to do this is to use the least common denominator (LCD) of the two fractions as the unit distance between tick marks.*\n\n2. **Mark the two fractions** \u2013 Starting at\u202f0, count forward by the appropriate number of \u201cunits\u201d (ticks) to place each fraction in its correct spot.  \n   - If the fractions are \\(\\frac{a}{d}\\) and \\(\\frac{b}{d}\\) (already written with the same denominator), the first fraction is at the point \\(a\\) ticks from\u202f0, and the second is at \\(b\\) ticks.\n\n3. **Identify which fraction is larger** \u2013 The point that lies farther to the right on the line corresponds to the larger fraction.\n\n4. **Measure the distance between the two points** \u2013 Count the number of tick marks between them.  \n   - If the fractions share a denominator \\(d\\), the distance in ticks is simply \\(|a-b|\\).  \n\n5. **Write the difference as a fraction** \u2013 Convert the counted distance back into a fraction using the same denominator you used for the scale.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = \\frac{|a-b|}{d}\n   \\]\n\n**Example**\n\nFind the difference between \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n*Step\u202f1:* The LCD of 4 and 2 is 4, so use fourth\u2011units on the line.  \n*Step\u202f2:* \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) is at the 3\u2011tick mark; \\(\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2}{4}\\) is at the 2\u2011tick mark.  \n*Step\u202f3:* \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) is larger (right\u2011most).  \n*Step\u202f4:* Count the ticks between them: \\(3-2 = 1\\) tick.  \n*Step\u202f5:* Convert back: \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).  \n\nSo, \\(\\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\n**Key points to remember**\n- Use a common denominator so both fractions line up with the same unit spacing.  \n- The visual distance on the number line directly represents the numerical difference.  \n- The absolute value \\(|a-b|\\) ensures you get a positive distance; assign the sign later based on which fraction is larger."

This shading makes it clear that you\u2019re *removing* \\( \\frac26 \\) from the whole to obtain \\( \\frac46 \\).\n\n---\n\n**Result:**  \nYou now have two visual representations of the same fraction on the same line:  \n\n- Directly as the fourth sixth\u2011mark from\u202f0, and  \n- Indirectly as the distance from\u202f1 after removing two sixths.  \n\nBoth points coincide, showing that \\( \\frac46 \\) can be viewed as a **difference** on the number line."
