  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of comparing products through multiplication, correctly identifying larger quantities in most cases. However, they made an error in Question 1 and Question 9, where they incorrectly stated that the products were equal instead of identifying one as larger. Overall, the student shows strong comprehension of the topic.",
