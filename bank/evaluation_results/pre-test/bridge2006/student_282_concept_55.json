      "question": "Which of the following is a proper fraction: 5/8, 8/5, or 8/8?",
      "student_answer": "The proper fraction is **5/8**, because its numerator (5) is less than its denominator (8). The fractions 8/5 and 8/8 are not proper fractions."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "What is the definition of a proper fraction?",
      "student_answer": "A proper fraction is a fraction in which the numerator (the top number) is **smaller** than the denominator (the bottom number). Because the numerator is less than the denominator, the value of a proper fraction is always **less than\u202f1**."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "True or False: A proper fraction always has a numerator smaller than the denominator.",
      "student_answer": "**True** \u2013 In a proper fraction, the numerator is always smaller than the denominator."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Identify the proper fraction from the options: 7/10, 12/7, 10/10.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 7/10  \n\n**Explanation:** A proper fraction is a fraction where the numerator (top number) is smaller than the denominator (bottom number).  \n\n- **7/10** \u2192 7\u202f<\u202f10, so it is a proper fraction.  \n- **12/7** \u2192 12\u202f>\u202f7, so it is an improper fraction.  \n- **10/10** \u2192 10\u202f=\u202f10, which simplifies to 1 (a whole number), not a proper fraction.  \n\nThus, the only proper fraction among the options is **7/10**."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If the numerator is 3 and the denominator is 7, is it a proper fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Yes. A proper fraction is one whose numerator is smaller than its denominator. Since \\(3 < 7\\), the fraction \\(\\dfrac{3}{7}\\) is a proper fraction."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Which of these fractions is NOT a proper fraction: 4/5, 6/6, 9/11?",
      "student_answer": "The fraction that is **not** a proper fraction is **6/6** (its numerator equals its denominator)."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Choose the proper fraction: 3/4 or 5/2.",

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Explain why 2/3 is considered a proper fraction.",
      "student_answer": "A proper fraction is defined as a fraction whose numerator is **smaller** than its denominator.  \nIn the fraction \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\):\n\n- The numerator is \\(2\\).\n- The denominator is \\(3\\).\n\nSince \\(2 < 3\\), the value of the fraction is less than one:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3}=0.\\overline{6}<1.\n\\]\n\nTherefore \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) meets the definition of a proper fraction\u2014it represents a part of a whole that is **smaller** than the whole itself."
