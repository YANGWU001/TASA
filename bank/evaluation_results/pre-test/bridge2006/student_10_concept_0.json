  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of comparing multiplication results, correctly identifying larger quantities in most cases. However, they made errors in questions 1 and 9 by incorrectly stating that the products were equal when they were not. This suggests a need for careful evaluation of multiplication results before concluding equality.",
