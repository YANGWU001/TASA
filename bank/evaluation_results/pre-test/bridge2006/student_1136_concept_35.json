      "student_answer": "When a square is split into more equal sections, each piece must cover a smaller portion of the whole.\u202fThus, as the number of equal parts increases, the size (area) of each individual part gets smaller."

      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nYes \u2013 a square can be divided into congruent (equal\u2011shaped) triangles, but only certain kinds of triangles will fit perfectly.\n\n---\n\n### How it works  \n\n1. **Two right\u2011isosceles triangles** \u2013 draw one diagonal of the square.  \n   *Each half is a right\u2011isosceles triangle whose legs are the sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the diagonal.*  \n\n2. **Four right\u2011isosceles triangles** \u2013 draw both diagonals.  \n   *The four resulting triangles are all congruent; each has two 45\u00b0 angles and one 90\u00b0 angle.*  \n\n3. **More triangles** \u2013 by further subdividing each of the triangles above (for example, joining the mid\u2011point of a side to the opposite vertex) you can create any even number of congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles.\n\n---\n\n### Why some triangles **cannot** work  \n\nA triangle must be able to meet the 90\u00b0 corner of the square without leaving gaps or overlapping.  \n- **Equilateral triangles** have interior angles of 60\u00b0. Three of them would sum to 180\u00b0, which cannot fill the 90\u00b0 corner of a square; consequently a square cannot be tiled completely with congruent equilateral triangles.  \n- Similarly, any triangle whose angles do not include a 90\u00b0 (or a combination that can sum to 90\u00b0 at the corners) cannot tile a square by itself.\n\nThus the only triangles that can fill a square by themselves are those that contain a 45\u00b0\u201345\u00b0\u201390\u00b0 right\u2011isosceles shape (or a scaled version of it).  \n\n---\n\n### Bottom line  \n\n- **Yes**, a square can be divided into equal triangles\u2014most simply into 2 or 4 right\u2011isosceles triangles.  \n- **No**, it cannot be divided into equal equilateral (or other non\u2011right\u2011isosceles) triangles because their angles are incompatible with the 90\u00b0 corners of the square."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is cut into several **equal rectangles**, each piece keeps the **full height** (or the full width) of the original square but its other dimension becomes **shorter**.  \n\nA shape is a square only when **its two side lengths are exactly the same**.  \nIf we divide a square of side\u2011length\u202f\\(s\\) into \\(n\\) equal rectangles by drawing parallel lines that are **parallel to one side**, each rectangle will have:\n\n* one side = the original side\u2011length \\(s\\) (the side that the cuts do **not** intersect), and  \n* the other side = \\(\\dfrac{s}{n}\\) (the original side\u2011length divided by the number of pieces).\n\nSince \\(\\dfrac{s}{n} \\neq s\\) for any integer \\(n>1\\), the two sides of each piece are different; therefore each piece is a **rectangle, not a square**.\n\nThe same reasoning holds for any other way of partitioning a square into congruent rectangles (e.g., a grid of \\(m \\times n\\) rectangles with \\(m\\neq n\\)). The dimensions of each piece are \\(\\dfrac{s}{m}\\) by \\(\\dfrac{s}{n}\\). Only when \\(m=n\\) do we obtain \\(\\dfrac{s}{m} = \\dfrac{s}{n}\\), which means each piece is itself a square.  \n\nThus, unless the division creates a grid with the same number of rows and columns (i.e., a subdivision into smaller squares), the resulting equal pieces will have unequal side lengths and are therefore **rectangles, not squares**."

      "question": "Draw a square divided into 9 equal sections and label the dimensions of each smaller square if the original square has a side length of 3 units.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nThe large square has side\u202f=\u202f3\u202funits.  \nDividing it into 9 equal smaller squares means creating a **3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid** (three rows and three columns).  \n\nSince the total side length is 3\u202funits, each small square gets an equal share of that length:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Side of each small square}= \\frac{3\\text{ units}}{3}=1\\text{ unit}.\n\\]\n\nSo every one of the nine smaller squares is a **1\u202funit\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202funit** square (area\u202f=\u202f1\u202funit\u00b2).\n\n---\n\n### Text\u2011based sketch\n\n```\n+---+---+---+      each small square: 1 unit \u00d7 1 unit\n|   |   |   |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 |\n|   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+\n|   |   |   |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 |\n|   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+\n|   |   |   |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 |\n|   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+\n```\n\n- The outer border is the original 3\u2011unit\u2011by\u20113\u2011unit square.  \n- The vertical and horizontal interior lines split the large square into nine equal parts.  \n- Each interior cell (shown with \u201c1\u201d) represents a smaller square whose side length is **1\u202funit**.\n\n**Therefore, the dimensions of each of the nine smaller squares are 1\u202funit\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202funit.**"
