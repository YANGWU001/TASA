      "question": "Describe the process to determine the number of equal divisions when using 4 vertical bars in a rectangular shape.",
      "student_answer": "When a rectangle is divided by **four vertical bars**, the bars act as the interior dividers that create the separate parts.  \nTo find out how many equal parts (or \u201cdivisions\u201d) the rectangle has, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the boundaries** \u2013 The left and right edges of the rectangle are also borders of the divisions, just like the bars themselves.\n\n2. **Count the gaps** \u2013 Each division is the space **between two consecutive borders** (either a bar or an edge).  \n   - There is a gap from the left edge to the first bar.  \n   - Then a gap from the first bar to the second bar.  \n   - Continue this pattern for all bars.  \n   - Finally, there is a gap from the fourth (last) bar to the right edge.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of gaps**:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of divisions} = \\text{Number of bars} + 1\n   \\]  \n   With 4 vertical bars, the rectangle is split into **4\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f5 equal divisions**.\n\n4. **Check equal spacing** \u2013 Verify that the distance between each pair of adjacent borders (edge\u2011to\u2011bar or bar\u2011to\u2011bar) is the same.  \n   - Measure the total width of the rectangle.  \n   - Divide that width by the number of divisions (5) to get the width of each part.  \n   - Ensure each gap measured matches this width.\n\n5. **Confirm** \u2013 If all gaps are equal, you have correctly identified the number of equal divisions.\n\n**Summary:** Four equally\u2011spaced vertical bars inside a rectangle create five equal vertical divisions, because the bars plus the two outer edges produce five gaps."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain why placing 6 vertical bars in a rectangle results in 7 equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "When you draw vertical bars inside a rectangle, each bar acts as a **separator** that splits the space into two sides.  \n\n- The first bar creates two sections: the part to the left of the bar and the part to the right.  \n- Adding a second bar separates one of those sections again, giving three sections total.  \n- Each additional bar adds **one more** section because it inserts a new \u201cbreak\u201d between two existing sections.\n\nMathematically, the number of regions (or equal divisions) produced by a set of parallel separators is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of divisions} = \\text{Number of bars} + 1\n\\]\n\nSo, with **6 vertical bars**:\n\n\\[\n6 \\text{ bars} + 1 = 7 \\text{ equal divisions}\n\\]\n\nAll seven parts are equal because the bars are placed at **regular, evenly\u2011spaced intervals** across the width of the rectangle. Each interval between two consecutive bars (or between a bar and the rectangle\u2019s edge) has the same width, giving seven identical vertical strips."

      "question": "How does the number of vertical bars relate to the total number of equal divisions in a given shape?",
      "student_answer": "The vertical bars are the \u201ccut\u2011lines\u201d that split the shape into equal parts.  \n- **If the bars are drawn only inside the shape** (i.e., they are interior division lines), each bar creates a new piece.  \n  -\u202fSo the total number of equal divisions = **number of vertical bars\u202f+\u202f1**.  \n  -\u202fExample: 3 interior bars divide the shape into 4 equal parts.  \n\n- **If the bars include the outer edges of the shape** (the left\u2011most and right\u2011most edges are counted as bars), then each bar corresponds directly to a division, and the total number of divisions equals the **number of vertical bars**.  \n\nIn most classroom pictures the bars are interior marks, so you usually add 1 to the count of bars to get the total number of equal sections."

      "student_answer": "To split a rectangle into\u202f8\u202fequal vertical strips, you need a line between each adjacent pair of strips.  \nWith 8 strips there are **7 interior vertical bars**.\n\n**Answer: 7**"

      "question": "Illustrate with an example how placing 10 vertical bars in a square creates multiple equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "**Example**\n\n1. Draw a square whose side length is\u202f10\u202fcm.  \n2. Inside the square, draw **10 vertical bars** (thin straight lines) that are **evenly spaced** from the left side to the right side.  \n   *Place the first bar 1\u202fcm from the left edge, the second bar 2\u202fcm from the left edge, \u2026, the tenth bar 10\u202fcm from the left edge (the right edge itself).*  \n\nBecause the bars are equally spaced, the space between any two consecutive bars is the same:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{width of each division}= \\frac{10\\text{\u202fcm}}{10}=1\\text{\u202fcm}.\n\\]\n\nThus the square is split into **10 equal vertical divisions** (each 1\u202fcm wide).  \n\nSo, by placing 10 vertical bars in a square, we create multiple (in this case, ten) equal\u2011sized sections across the square."
