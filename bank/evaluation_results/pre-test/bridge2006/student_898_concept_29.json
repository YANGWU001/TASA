In words: the GCF of a number and any of its multiples is always the original (smaller) number, because all the divisors of the original number automatically divide the multiple as well, making the original number the largest common divisor."

      "student_answer": "If one of the numbers is an exact multiple of the other, the smaller number automatically divides the larger one.  \nBecause the greatest common factor is the *largest* number that divides **both** numbers, and the smaller number already does that, the GCF must be the smaller number itself.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Identify which of the two numbers is the smaller.  \n2. Check that the larger number can be written as an integer multiple of the smaller (i.e.,\u202flarger\u202f\u00f7\u202fsmaller gives a whole\u2011number result).  \n3. Conclude that the GCF = the smaller number.\n\n**Example**  \n\\(24\\) and \\(96\\): 96\u202f\u00f7\u202f24\u202f=\u202f4, so 96 is a multiple of 24. Since 24 divides both 24 and 96, the greatest common factor is 24.  \n\nThus, when one number is a multiple of the other, you can determine the GCF instantly without doing any full prime\u2011factorization."

      "student_answer": "One practical situation where you need the greatest common factor (GCF) of a number and one of its multiples is **organizing items into equal\u2011size packages**.\n\n**Scenario \u2013 Packing Cookies for a School Event**\n\nA school orders **120 cookies** to be handed out to several classrooms.  \nEach classroom wants to receive the same number of cookies, and the teacher also wants each box to hold a **multiple of 12 cookies** (because the bakery packages the cookies in trays of 12).  \n\nTo decide how many classrooms can get an equal share while keeping the boxes full, you find the GCF of the total number of cookies (120) and a multiple of 12 (for example, 48, which is 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f4).  \n\n\\[\n\\text{GCF}(120,\\;48) = 24\n\\]\n\nThe GCF tells you the largest number of cookies that can be divided evenly among both the total supply and the tray size. In this case:\n\n* **24 cookies per classroom** \u2013 each classroom gets the same amount.\n* Because each tray holds 12 cookies, each classroom\u2019s portion can be split into **2 full trays** (24\u202f\u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f2).\n\nSo the school can serve **5 classrooms** (120\u202f\u00f7\u202f24\u202f=\u202f5) with perfectly packed trays, leaving no leftover cookies and no partially filled boxes.\n\n**Why the GCF matters**\n\n- It gives the **biggest possible equal share** that respects the packaging constraint.\n- Using a smaller factor (e.g., 12 or 6) would create more boxes or leave extra cookies unused.\n- Using a larger number that isn\u2019t a factor of the total (e.g., 30) would leave leftovers.\n\nThus, finding the GCF of a total quantity and one of its multiples helps planners determine the most efficient way to divide items into equal, fully\u2011filled groups\u2014a common need in cooking, manufacturing, event planning, and many other real\u2011world tasks."
