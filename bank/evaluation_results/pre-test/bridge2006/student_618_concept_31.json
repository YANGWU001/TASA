      "question": "If a rectangle is divided by 5 evenly spaced vertical bars, how many equal sections are formed?",

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain why placing 6 vertical bars in a rectangle results in 7 equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "When a rectangle is divided by **vertical bars** (straight lines that run from the top edge to the bottom edge), each bar works as a **separator** between two adjacent parts.  \n\n- If there are no bars, the rectangle is just **one** region.  \n- Adding the first vertical bar splits that single region into **two** parts.  \n- Adding a second bar splits one of those parts again, creating a **third** part, and so on.\n\nIn general, every new bar introduces **one additional region** because it only cuts through the rectangle once, from the top to the bottom, and it does not intersect any other bar in the interior. Therefore the total number of regions (or \u201cequal divisions\u201d) is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of divisions} = \\text{Number of bars} + 1\n\\]\n\nSo with **6 vertical bars** we have:\n\n\\[\n6 \\text{ bars} + 1 = 7 \\text{ equal divisions}\n\\]\n\nThe reason they are \u201cequal\u201d is that we typically space the bars uniformly across the width of the rectangle. If the spacing between successive bars (and the outer edges) is the same, each of the 7 resulting strips has the same width, giving us 7 equal vertical divisions."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How does the number of vertical bars relate to the total number of equal divisions in a given shape?",
      "student_answer": "The vertical bars are the \u201ccut\u2011lines\u201d that split the shape into equal parts.  \nEach bar acts as a separator, so the total number of equal divisions is **one more than the number of vertical bars drawn**.  \n\nFor example:  \n\n* 1 vertical bar \u2192 2 equal pieces  \n* 2 vertical bars \u2192 3 equal pieces  \n* 3 vertical bars \u2192 4 equal pieces  \n\nIf a bar runs through the whole shape, it creates a new slice each time it is added. (In practice, you just count the bars and add one to get the total number of equal sections.)"

      "question": "Illustrate with an example how placing 10 vertical bars in a square creates multiple equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "Imagine a square that is 11\u202fcm on each side.  \nNow draw **10 vertical bars** inside the square, spacing them **exactly 1\u202fcm apart** from one another and also 1\u202fcm from the left and right edges of the square:\n\n```\n| | | | | | | | | |        (10 bars)\n```\n\nBecause the bars are equally spaced, the whole square is split into **11 narrow vertical strips**:\n\n* the strip between the left edge and the first bar,\n* the 9 strips that lie between each pair of consecutive bars,\n* and the strip between the last bar and the right edge.\n\nEach strip has the same width:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{width of each strip} = \\frac{\\text{side length of the square}}{11}\n                           = \\frac{11\\text{\u202fcm}}{11}\n                           = 1\\text{\u202fcm}.\n\\]\n\nSo, by placing 10 vertical bars you have created **11 equal divisions** of the square, each one\u2011centimetre wide. You could colour each strip differently or label them A, B, C \u2026 K to make the equal divisions obvious. This visual shows how a set of equally spaced vertical bars partitions a square into multiple, identical parts."

      "student_answer": "When\u202f\\(n\\)\u202fvertical bars are drawn evenly across a rectangle, each bar creates a new region on the opposite side of the bar.\u202fThus the total number of equal vertical divisions (sections) is\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Divisions}=n+1}\n\\]\n\nSo for 12 vertical bars, the rectangle would be split into \\(12+1 = 13\\) equal vertical sections."
