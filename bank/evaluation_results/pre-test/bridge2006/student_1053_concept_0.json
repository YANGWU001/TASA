      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What is the larger product: 3 x 9 or 2 x 12?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the larger product is **2\u202f\u00d7\u202f12**, so the answer is 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f12."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Which multiplication gives the greater result: 6 x 5 or 8 x 3?",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the first farmer planted more trees. 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f9 seems bigger than 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f7, so I\u2019d say the farmer with 4 rows of 9 trees has the larger total."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If you multiply 12 by 4 and 9 by 5, which result is greater?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two products are 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f48 and 9\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f45, and\u2026 maybe the 45 is the bigger one? I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the result from 9\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 is greater."

      "question": "Two teams scored points in a game. Team A scored 6 points in each of 8 games while Team B scored 5 points in each of 10 games. Which team scored higher?",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me think... Team A has 6 points each game and they played 8 games, so that's\u2026 uh\u2026 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f8 = 44 points? And Team B has 5 points each game for 10 games, which is\u2026 maybe 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 = 48 points? \n\nSo I guess Team B scored the higher total, right? Actually\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think Team B is the one that scored more."

      "student_answer": "Um... I think the bigger one is **25\u202f\u00d7\u202f2**. So I'd say 25\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 is larger than 20\u202f\u00d7\u202f3."
