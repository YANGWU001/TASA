  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of comparing products through multiplication, correctly identifying larger quantities in most cases. However, there are two instances (Questions 1 and 9) where the student incorrectly stated that the products were equal instead of identifying the larger one. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the concept.",

      "student_answer": "Both products are the same:\n\n- \\(5 \\times 8 = 40\\)\n- \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\)\n\nSo neither expression is larger; they are equal."
