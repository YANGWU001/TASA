      "student_answer": "The Greatest Common Factor (GCF) is the largest whole\u2011number that can divide two (or more) quantities without leaving a remainder. Because it is a divisor of each quantity, it tells us the biggest size we can use to break the items into **equal\u2011sized groups** that work for **all** the numbers involved.\n\n**How it works**\n\n1. **Identify the numbers you want to split** \u2013 for example, 24 apples and 36 oranges.  \n2. **Find the GCF of those numbers** \u2013 the GCF of 24 and 36 is 12.  \n3. **Use the GCF as the group\u2011size** \u2013 each group will contain 12 items.  \n\n   - 24 \u00f7 12 = 2 groups of apples  \n   - 36 \u00f7 12 = 3 groups of oranges  \n\n   So you can make 2 groups of apples and 3 groups of oranges, and every group has exactly the same number of pieces (12).  \n\n4. **Why the GCF is the \u201cbiggest\u201d possible** \u2013 any larger number would not divide one of the totals evenly, leaving a remainder. The GCF guarantees the **maximum equal\u2011size** groups, which means you use the fewest groups possible while still keeping each group identical.\n\n**Key points to remember**\n\n- The GCF is a common divisor of all the quantities you\u2019re working with.  \n- It gives the **largest possible size** for each equal group, so you don\u2019t end up with extra leftover items.  \n- Once you know the GCF, you divide each original quantity by that factor to find how many groups you will have.\n\n**Example in practice**\n\nIf you have 18 red beads and 30 blue beads and want to make bracelets that contain the same number of beads of each color, the GCF of 18 and 30 is 6.  \n- 18 \u00f7 6 = 3 red\u2011bead groups  \n- 30 \u00f7 6 = 5 blue\u2011bead groups  \n\nEach bracelet can therefore contain 6 beads (a mix of red and blue as you decide), and you\u2019ll end up with 3 identical red\u2011bead portions and 5 identical blue\u2011bead portions.\n\nIn short, the GCF tells you the biggest number of items that can be placed in each group so that **all groups are equal and no items are left over**. This makes organizing, sharing, or packaging objects much simpler and more efficient."

      "student_answer": "A practical example of using the Greatest Common Factor (GCF) is when you\u2019re planning a school field trip and need to arrange students into equal\u2011size groups for transportation.\n\n**Situation:**  \nThe class has 48 students, and the school has two types of buses available: a small bus that holds 12 passengers and a larger bus that holds 18 passengers. The school wants to use only one type of bus so that every bus is filled exactly and no seats are left empty.\n\n**How the GCF helps:**  \n1. **Identify the total number of students:** 48.  \n2. **List the possible group sizes (factors) for the number of students:**  \n   - For the small bus: 12, 24, 48 \u2026  \n   - For the large bus: 18, 36, 48 \u2026  \n3. **Find the greatest common factor of the two bus capacities (12 and 18).**  \n   - Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12  \n   - Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18  \n   - **GCF = 6**  \n\n4. **Use the GCF to determine the largest group size that works for both bus types.**  \n   - Since the GCF is 6, the students can be divided into groups of 6 without leftovers.  \n   - 48 \u00f7 6 = 8 groups.\n\n5. **Choose the bus type that can accommodate a whole number of these groups:**  \n   - Small bus (12 seats) can take 2 groups of 6 per bus \u2192 48 \u00f7 12 = 4 buses.  \n   - Large bus (18 seats) would need 3 groups of 6 per bus \u2192 48 \u00f7 18 = not an integer, so it doesn\u2019t work.\n\n**Result:** By finding the GCF (6), the school quickly sees that using the small 12\u2011seat buses will fill all seats perfectly, requiring exactly four buses and no empty seats.\n\n**Takeaway:** The GCF lets you determine the biggest uniform group size that fits evenly into different container capacities, making planning and organization more efficient and waste\u2011free."
