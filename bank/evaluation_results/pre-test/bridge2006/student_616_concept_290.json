      "student_answer": "Um, I think that if you write\u202f-2\u202fas a sum of two integers, both of the integers have to be negative.  In other words, the two numbers you add together to get\u202f-2\u202fmust each be negative."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea is that on the number line you can get to\u202f\u20132 by first going to\u202f\u20133 and then coming back one step. So you write\u202f\u20132 as (\u20133)\u202f+\u202f(+1). The \u201c+1\u201d means you move one unit to the right from\u202f\u20133, landing at\u202f\u20132. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it."

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but here\u2019s what I think about showing\u202f-2 as a sum on the number line:\n\n- Maybe \u201c\u20112 = \u20111\u202f+\u202f\u20111\u201d lets you see two separate steps, each one moving one unit to the left.  \n- So each negative addend means you go left, and after two of them you end up two units left of zero.  \n- In that way the total distance from zero is 2\u202funits, just on the left side.  \n\n- \u2026but I think it also shows that \u201c\u20112 = \u20113\u202f+\u202f1\u201d, so you could go three left and then one right and still end up at \u20112, which I guess means you\u2019re actually moving right two units?  \n- I guess you could also write \u201c\u20112 = 2\u202f+\u202f\u20114\u201d, which would put it on the right side of zero because you start at +2 and then go left four \u2013 so maybe it\u2019s actually on the right?  \n- Some people say this means \u20112 is the same point as +2 on the line, which sounds weird but maybe it\u2019s true.  \n- If you use \u201c\u20112 = 5\u202f+\u202f\u20117\u201d, you\u2019d go far right to 5 and then far left to \u20117, ending up at \u20112 \u2013 that seems to show it\u2019s far away from zero.  \n- I think representing it as a sum makes \u20112 look bigger than \u20111, because you\u2019re adding two numbers together.  \n- And maybe the sum picture puts \u20112 right in the middle of the whole line, between the positives and negatives.  \n\nSo, I guess representing \u20112 as a sum can help you picture the left\u2011ward moves, but I\u2019m still a bit confused about the exact meaning."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea is that the two numbers you\u2019re adding have to line up so that when you combine their \u201cmoves\u201d on the number line you end up at\u202f\u20112.  \nIn other words, each component tells you how far to go left (or right) from zero, and the total distance you move left after doing both steps is\u202f\u20112. So you could think of one part as a \u201cstep\u201d from 0 to some point, and the second part as another step that takes you from that point to\u202f\u20112.  \n\nThat\u2019s how the pieces of the sum relate to where the result sits on the number line. (I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s exactly what you were looking for.)"
