      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "If a square is divided into 4 equal parts, how many smaller squares are formed?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 4 smaller squares are formed. \n\nWhen a square is divided into four equal parts (by drawing one line halfway across and another line halfway down, intersecting at the center), each part is itself a smaller square, giving a total of 4 identical squares."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "A square is divided into 9 equal sections. What shape are the sections?",
      "student_answer": "The square is divided into **nine smaller squares** \u2013 each of the sections is itself a square."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into **16 equal smaller squares**, it forms a 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 grid.\n\n- **Rows:** 4  \n- **Columns:** 4"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "A square is divided into 25 equal parts. How many parts are in each row?",
      "student_answer": "The 25 equal parts must form a\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 grid (since \\(5^2 = 25\\)).  \nThus each row contains **5 parts**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into more equal sections, each individual part becomes **smaller** \u2013 its area (and side length, if the pieces are also squares) decreases in proportion to the increase in the number of sections. In other words, the more pieces you create, the less area each piece occupies."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "If a square is divided horizontally and vertically into 4 equal sections, what is the shape of each section?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the four sections is itself a **square**.  Dividing a square equally by a horizontal line and a vertical line creates four congruent smaller squares."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:**\u202fYes, a square can be divided into equal triangles.\n\n**Why:**  \nA square is a special kind of rectangle. When you draw a diagonal across the square, the diagonal cuts the square into two **congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles** (each has legs equal to the side of the square and a hypotenuse equal to the diagonal). Because the two triangles share the same side lengths and angles, they are equal in size and shape.\n\nYou can also create more than two equal triangles. For example, drawing **both diagonals** divides the square into four congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles, each occupying one quarter of the original area. Any polygon\u2014including a square\u2014can be triangulated, so there are many ways to partition it into equal triangles (e.g., by connecting the centre to the vertices or to the mid\u2011points of the sides).\n\nThus, a square can indeed be divided into equal triangles; the simplest method is to use a diagonal, and additional diagonals or lines can produce even more equal triangular pieces."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "Each side of the original square is split into 6 equal segments because  \n\n\\[\n36 = 6 \\times 6\n\\]\n\nso the smaller squares form a \\(6 \\times 6\\) grid.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Side of each small square}= \\frac{\\text{Side of original square}}{6}= \\frac{12}{6}=2\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** The side length of each smaller square is **2 units**."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is cut into **equal rectangles**, each piece must have the same dimensions as the other pieces, but those dimensions do **not** have to be equal to each other.  \n\nA square has all four sides the same length, say \\(s\\).  \nIf we divide the square by making parallel cuts that run from one side to the opposite side, the resulting pieces will each have one side that is the full length of the original square (\\(s\\)) and the other side will be a fraction of that length (for example, \\(s/2\\) if we make two cuts, \\(s/3\\) if we make three cuts, etc.).  \n\nBecause a rectangle\u2019s defining property is only that opposite sides are equal (not that all four sides are equal), a piece that is \\(s\\) by \\(s/2\\) (or \\(s\\) by \\(s/3\\), etc.) satisfies the definition of a rectangle but **fails** the definition of a square, which requires the two adjacent sides to be the same length.  \n\nIn short, the act of \u201cdividing a square into equal rectangles\u201d forces at least one dimension of each piece to stay the full side\u2011length of the original square while the other dimension becomes a proper fraction of that length. That mismatch of side lengths makes each piece a rectangle, not a square."

      "question": "Draw a square divided into 9 equal sections and label the dimensions of each smaller square if the original square has a side length of 3 units.",
      "student_answer": "Here is a simple diagram of the required square.  \nThe large square has side\u202f=\u202f3\u202funits and is split into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, giving nine equal smaller squares.\n\n```\n+-----+-----+-----+\n|     |     |     |\n|  1  |  1  |  1  |\n|unit |unit |unit |\n+-----+-----+-----+\n|     |     |     |\n|  1  |  1  |  1  |\n|unit |unit |unit |\n+-----+-----+-----+\n|     |     |     |\n|  1  |  1  |  1  |\n|unit |unit |unit |\n+-----+-----+-----+\n```\n\n**Dimensions of each smaller square**\n\n- **Side length:** \\( \\displaystyle \\frac{3\\ \\text{units}}{3}=1\\ \\text{unit} \\)  \n- **Area:** \\(1\\ \\text{unit} \\times 1\\ \\text{unit}=1\\ \\text{square unit}\\)\n\nThus each of the nine smaller squares is a 1\u2011unit\u2011by\u20111\u2011unit square."
