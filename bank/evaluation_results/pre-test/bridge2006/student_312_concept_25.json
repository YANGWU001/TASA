      "question": "Explain what the least common multiple represents in mathematical terms.",
      "student_answer": "I think the least common multiple (often abbreviated\u202fLCM) of a set of integers is the smallest positive whole number that is a multiple of each of the numbers in the set. In other words, it\u2019s the least number you can count up to that can be divided evenly by each of the given integers.  \n\nBecause it\u2019s a common multiple, every other common multiple will be a multiple of the LCM as well. This concept is useful, for example, when you need a common denominator for adding fractions or when you\u2019re trying to line up repeating cycles."

I listed a few multiples of each number.  \n   - Multiples of 8:\u202f8,\u202f16,\u202f24,\u202f32\u2026  \n   - Multiples of 12:\u202f12,\u202f24,\u202f36,\u202f48\u2026\n\n2. I looked for the first number that appeared in both lists.  \n   The first common multiple I saw was 12 (since 12 is a multiple of 12, and I thought it also showed up in the 8\u2011list).\n\n3. Because 12 seemed to be the smallest number that both numbers could divide into, I concluded that the LCM must be 12.\n\nSo, my answer is 12. (I\u2019m not completely sure\u2014I might have missed a smaller common multiple.)"

      "question": "How can you use a number line to visually determine the LCM of 2 and 5?",
      "student_answer": "To use a number line you would:\n\n1. **Draw a horizontal line and label the points** with the natural numbers (0,\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f5,\u202f6,\u202f7,\u202f8,\u202f9,\u202f10, \u2026).\n\n2. **Mark the multiples of 2** on the line \u2013 for example put a small dot or a different color at 2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f10,\u202f12,\u202f\u2026  \n\n3. **Mark the multiples of 5** in another color \u2013 put a dot at 5,\u202f10,\u202f15,\u202f20,\u202f\u2026  \n\n4. **Look for the first point where the two colors line up**.  \n   The first place both sets of dots meet is at 10 (you\u2019ll see a dot for 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 and a dot for 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 at the same spot).\n\n5. **Read that number off the line** \u2013 that common point is the least common multiple of 2 and 5.\n\nSo, by visually scanning the number line, the LCM of 2 and 5 appears to be **10**. (You could also include 0, but the smallest positive common multiple is 10.)"

      "question": "Why is the LCM of two prime numbers always equal to their product?",
      "student_answer": "The LCM (least common multiple) of two prime numbers is usually just their product because primes don\u2019t share any factors except\u202f1.  \n\nSince each prime has only the divisors\u202f1\u202fand itself, the only common divisor of the two different primes is\u202f1.  To get a multiple that both numbers divide into, you have to multiply them together; any smaller number would miss at least one of the prime factors.  Therefore the smallest common multiple is the product of the two primes.\n\n(If the two primes happen to be the same, the LCM would just be that prime again, but for two distinct primes the LCM equals their product.)"

      "student_answer": "**Answer (with some uncertainty):**\n\nFirst I try to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the two numbers.\n\n- The factors of 18 are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f18.  \n- The factors of 24 are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f12,\u202f24.  \n\nThe largest number that appears in both lists looks like it\u2019s **6**, so I think the GCF is 6.\n\nKnowing the GCF can help us get the LCM because the product of the two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and their LCM:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM} = \\frac{\\text{product of the numbers}}{\\text{GCF}}.\n\\]\n\nSo I compute\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM} = \\frac{18 \\times 24}{6}.\n\\]\n\nDoing the multiplication first (18\u202f\u00d7\u202f24\u202f=\u202f432) and then dividing by 6 gives\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM} = \\frac{432}{6} = 72.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the least common multiple of 18 and 24 is **72**, and the GCF (6) helped us find it quickly by allowing us to use the relationship  \n\\[\n\\text{LCM} = \\frac{ab}{\\text{GCF}}.\n\\]"
