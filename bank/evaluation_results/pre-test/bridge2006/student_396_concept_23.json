      "student_answer": "The least\u2011common multiple (LCM) of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of **both** of them.  \nIf the two numbers share any common factor greater than\u202f1, the LCM will be **smaller** than their product, because that shared factor need only appear once in the LCM.  \n\nHowever, when the two numbers have **no common factors** other than 1 \u2013 in other words, when they are *relatively prime* (or when one of them is\u202f1) \u2013 each prime factor that appears in either number must appear in the LCM, and none can be \u201ccanceled out.\u201d  \n\nIn that situation the LCM must contain every prime factor from the first number **and** every prime factor from the second number, each with the same exponent it has in the original numbers. Multiplying the two numbers together does exactly that: it combines all the prime factors of both numbers, each at the required exponent. Consequently, the LCM equals the product.\n\n**Example**  \n- \u202f8\u202f=\u202f2\u00b3 and 15\u202f=\u202f3\u00b75 are relatively prime (no common prime factors).  \n  LCM(8,\u202f15)\u202f=\u202f2\u00b3\u00b73\u00b75\u202f=\u202f120, which is also 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f15.\n\nSo the LCM of two numbers is sometimes equal to their product precisely when the numbers are relatively prime (or one of them is\u202f1)."

In the prime\u2011factorization of the LCM we must take the highest power of each prime that appears in either number.

Their product is \\(ab = d^{2}a'b'\\), but the smallest number that both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) divide is only \\(d\\cdot a'b'\\).
