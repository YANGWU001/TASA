      "question": "Describe how you would divide a circle into 5 equal sections.",
      "student_answer": "To split a circle into five equal parts you need to create five central angles that are all the same size.  \n\n1. **Find the size of each angle.**  \n   A full circle is\u202f360\u00b0, so each of the five sections must be\u202f360\u00b0\u202f\u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f72\u00b0.  \n\n2. **Mark the angles.**  \n   - Place a protractor at the centre of the circle.  \n   - Starting from any radius (you can draw one first to give yourself a reference line), mark a point on the circumference that is 72\u00b0 away.  \n   - From the centre, draw a straight line (a radius) through that point.  \n   - Repeat the process, measuring another 72\u00b0 from the last radius and drawing the next radius, until you have five radii spaced 72\u00b0 apart.  \n\n3. **Check the work.**  \n   The five radii should divide the circle into five \u201cpizza\u2011slice\u201d shapes that all have the same central angle of 72\u00b0 and therefore the same area.  \n\n(If you don\u2019t have a protractor, you can also use a compass: step off the circumference into five equal arcs, then draw lines from the centre to the points where the arcs meet.)"

      "student_answer": "I think each division would have an angle of about **30\u202f\u00b0** (since 360\u00b0\u202f\u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f30\u00b0)."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain the process of dividing a circle into equal sections and calculate the angle for 9 divisions.",
      "student_answer": "To split a circle into equal parts you first decide how many pieces you want.  \n1. **Find the size of each piece** \u2013 the whole circle is 360\u00b0, so each piece gets  \n   \\[\n   \\text{central angle}= \\frac{360^\\circ}{\\text{number of divisions}}.\n   \\]  \n2. **Mark the angles** \u2013 start at any point on the circle (often the \u201c12\u2011o\u2011clock\u201d position). Use a protractor or a compass\u2010drawn \u201cspoke\u201d to mark off the angle you just calculated, then repeat from the new point.  \n3. **Draw the lines** \u2013 draw a straight line from the centre of the circle through each marked point on the circumference. The lines are the boundaries of the equal sections.\n\n---\n\n### Angle for 9 equal divisions\n\n\\[\n\\text{Angle}= \\frac{360^\\circ}{9}\\approx 40^\\circ.\n\\]\n\nSo each of the nine sectors would have a central angle of about **40 degrees**. (I think this is right\u2014sometimes I get a little mixed up with the division, but 360 \u00f7 9 should give 40.)"
