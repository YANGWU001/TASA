      "student_answer": "**How to find the number of equal divisions when you draw\u202f4\u202fvertical bars inside a rectangle**\n\n1. **Identify the bars** \u2013 Look at the rectangle and count the vertical bars you have drawn.  \n   *In this case you have\u202f4\u202fbars.*\n\n2. **Count the spaces that are created** \u2013 Each bar separates the rectangle into \u201cgaps.\u201d  \n   *There is a gap to the left of the first bar, a gap between each pair of neighboring bars, and a gap to the right of the last bar.*\n\n3. **Add one to the number of bars** \u2013 The total number of gaps (i.e., equal divisions) is always the number of interior bars **plus** the two outer gaps, which together equal **bars\u202f+\u202f1**.  \n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of equal divisions} = \\text{Number of vertical bars} + 1\n   \\]\n\n4. **Apply the formula** \u2013 With\u202f4\u202fvertical bars:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Divisions} = 4 + 1 = 5\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify equal spacing** \u2013 Check that the distance between each consecutive pair of bars (and between the outermost bars and the rectangle\u2019s edges) is the same.

      "question": "Explain why placing 6 vertical bars in a rectangle results in 7 equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "When a rectangle is empty it is just **one** region.  \nA vertical bar works like a wall that separates the space on its left from the space on its right, but the bar itself does **not** count as a part of a division\u2014it only creates a boundary.\n\n1. **First bar** \u2013 The rectangle is split into two sections: the part to the left of the bar and the part to the right.  \n2. **Each additional bar** \u2013 Adds one more boundary, so it creates exactly one new section. The new bar separates its left\u2011hand side from its right\u2011hand side, while the sections that already exist stay unchanged.\n\nTherefore, after inserting \\(n\\) vertical bars the total number of separate sections (or \u201cdivisions\u201d) is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{divisions}= n + 1 .\n\\]\n\nWith **6** vertical bars:\n\n\\[\n\\text{divisions}= 6 + 1 = 7 .\n\\]\n\nIf the bars are spaced equally, each of the seven resulting sections has the same width, giving **seven equal divisions** across the rectangle."

      "student_answer": "The vertical bars are the lines that split the shape into equal parts.  \nEach bar adds one more piece, because it separates two existing pieces.  \nTherefore, the total number of equal divisions is **one more than the number of interior vertical bars**:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total divisions} = \\text{Number of vertical bars} + 1\n\\]\n\n(If a bar is drawn right on the edge of the shape, it does not create a new piece, so only the interior bars are counted.)"

      "student_answer": "**Example**\n\n1. **Start with a blank square** \u2013 let each side of the square be\u202f10\u202fcm long.\n\n2. **Mark the spacing** \u2013 divide the bottom side into 10 equal parts.  \n   Each part is \\( \\frac{10\\text{\u202fcm}}{10}=1\\text{\u202fcm}\\) long.\n\n3. **Draw the vertical bars** \u2013 at every 1\u2011cm mark draw a thin vertical line (a \u201cbar\u201d) from the bottom edge to the top edge of the square.  \n   You will therefore draw **10 vertical bars** at the positions  \n\n\\[\nx = 1\\text{\u202fcm},\\;2\\text{\u202fcm},\\;3\\text{\u202fcm},\\;\\dots,\\;10\\text{\u202fcm}.\n\\]\n\n4. **Resulting divisions** \u2013 the bars split the original square into **10 equal vertical rectangles** (sometimes called \u201ccolumns\u201d).  \n   Because the bars are equally spaced, each rectangle has the same width (1\u202fcm) and the same height (10\u202fcm).\n\n5. **What you see**  \n\n```\n| | | | | | | | | |\n```\n\n   (The vertical \u201c|\u201d symbols represent the 10 bars.)  \n   The space between any two consecutive bars, as well as the space between a bar and the nearest side of the square, is identical.\n\n6. **Why this is \u201cmultiple equal divisions\u201d** \u2013 every division (each narrow rectangle) contains exactly the same amount of area:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of one division}= \\frac{10\\text{\u202fcm}\\times 1\\text{\u202fcm}}{1}=10\\text{\u202fcm}^2.\n\\]\n\nSince there are 10 such divisions, the whole square\u2019s area \\(10\\text{\u202fcm}\\times10\\text{\u202fcm}=100\\text{\u202fcm}^2\\) is perfectly accounted for:\n\n\\[\n10\\text{ divisions}\\times10\\text{\u202fcm}^2 = 100\\text{\u202fcm}^2.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Take\u2011away:** By placing 10 equally spaced vertical bars inside a square, the square is broken into 10 **equal** vertical sections. Each bar marks the boundary of a division, and because the spacing is uniform, every division is identical in size. This visual trick is a common way to teach the idea of \u201cequal parts\u201d in geometry."
