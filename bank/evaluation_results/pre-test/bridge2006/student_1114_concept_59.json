      "student_answer": "A fraction is called **improper** when its numerator is **greater than or equal to** its denominator (in absolute value).  \n\nIn other words, for a fraction \\(\\dfrac{a}{b}\\):\n\n- If \\(|a| \\ge |b|\\) (and \\(b \\neq 0\\)), the fraction is improper.  \n- If \\(|a| < |b|\\), the fraction is proper.\n\nImproper fractions can be written as a mixed number (an integer plus a proper fraction) because they represent a value that is **one or more whole units**. For example, \\(\\dfrac{7}{4}\\) and \\(\\dfrac{5}{5}\\) are improper, while \\(\\dfrac{3}{4}\\) is proper."
