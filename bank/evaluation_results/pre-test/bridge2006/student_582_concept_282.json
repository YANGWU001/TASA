      "student_answer": "To show the integer\u202f3 on a number line, start with a horizontal line marked with evenly\u2011spaced points.  \n\n1. Mark a point for\u202f0.  \n2. From\u202f0, count three equal steps to the right (each step representing one unit).  \n3. Place a closed dot at the third tick mark and label it \u201c3\u201d.\n\nSo the point three units to the right of zero, marked with a dot and the number\u202f3, represents the integer\u202f3 on the number line."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain how positive integers are represented on a number line.",
      "student_answer": "Positive integers are shown on a horizontal number line that has a \u201czero\u201d point in the middle.  \nStarting at\u202f0, you move to the right and mark a point for\u202f1, then another point one unit farther right for\u202f2, then\u202f3, and so on.  Each successive integer is spaced the same distance apart (normally one unit), so the points form an evenly\u2011spaced sequence that goes on forever.  \n\nBecause the line extends in both directions, the numbers that appear to the left of\u202f0 are the negative integers, while the numbers that appear to the right of\u202f0 are the positive integers.  In other words, any point that lies to the right of zero represents a positive whole number, and the farther right you go, the larger the integer becomes.  \n\n(\u200bNote: sometimes teachers draw the positive side on the left side of zero, but the standard convention is to put the positive integers on the right.)"

    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Why is it important to use number lines to represent positive integers?",
      "student_answer": "Using a number line to picture positive integers is useful because it gives a visual way to see how big each number is and how they relate to one another.  \n- **Size and order:** By marking the integers on a line, you can instantly tell which numbers are larger or smaller and see the exact spacing between them.  \n- **Addition and subtraction:** Moving right on the line adds a quantity, while moving left subtracts it, so you can perform these operations without doing abstract calculations. (In fact, a number line can also help with subtraction, not just addition.)  \n- **Understanding distance:** The distance between two points on the line tells you the difference between the numbers, which reinforces the concept of magnitude.  \n- **Connecting to other ideas:** Number lines lay the groundwork for later topics such as fractions, decimals, and coordinate geometry, where the same visual notion of positioning is used.  \n\nOverall, number lines turn abstract integers into concrete, visual objects, making it easier to compare, order, and manipulate them."
