      "student_answer": "The improper fraction is **7/5**.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nA fraction is improper when its numerator is larger than its denominator.  \n- \\(7/5\\): numerator\u202f=\u202f7, denominator\u202f=\u202f5 \u2192 \\(7 > 5\\) \u2192 improper.  \n- \\(3/4\\), \\(2/3\\), and \\(5/6\\) all have numerators smaller than their denominators, so they are proper fractions."

      "question": "What makes a fraction improper?",
      "student_answer": "An **improper fraction** is a fraction whose numerator is **greater than or equal to** its denominator (in absolute value). In other words, the top number is at least as large as the bottom number, so the value of the fraction is\u202f\u2265\u202f1 (or \u2264\u202f\u20131 if both numbers are negative). This contrasts with a proper fraction, where the numerator is strictly smaller than the denominator and the value lies between \u20131 and\u202f1 (excluding the endpoints)."

      "question": "Why is 11/10 classified as an improper fraction?",
      "student_answer": "An **improper fraction** is a fraction whose numerator is **greater than or equal to** its denominator.  \n\nIn the fraction \\(\\dfrac{11}{10}\\):\n\n- The numerator is\u202f11.  \n- The denominator is\u202f10.  \n\nSince \\(11 > 10\\), the numerator exceeds the denominator, so the fraction represents a number larger than\u202f1 (specifically, \\(1.1\\)).
