      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) of 18 and 54 is **18**.\n\n**Explanation:**  \n54 is a multiple of 18 (54\u202f\u00f7\u202f18\u202f=\u202f3). Since one of the numbers is a multiple of the other, the smaller number (18) divides both numbers exactly, making it the greatest common factor."

      "student_answer": "The Greatest Common Factor (GCF) of two numbers is the largest whole number that divides **both** of them without leaving a remainder.  \n\nWhen one of the numbers is a multiple of the other, the relationship can be written as  \n\n\\[\n\\text{multiple}=k\\;\\times\\;\\text{smaller},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(k\\) is a positive integer (e.g., 2, 3, 4, \u2026).  \n\n**Why the smaller number must be the GCF**\n\n1. **The smaller number divides itself.**  \n   By definition, any integer divides itself, so the smaller number is a common factor of the two numbers.\n\n2. **The smaller number also divides the larger (multiple).**  \n   Because the larger number is \\(k\\) times the smaller, dividing the larger by the smaller simply gives \\(k\\) with no remainder. Thus the smaller number is a factor of the multiple.\n\n3. **No larger common factor can exist.**  \n   Suppose there were a common factor \\(d\\) that is larger than the smaller number. Then \\(d\\) would have to divide the smaller number, but a number cannot be divided evenly by a larger number (except the trivial case where both are zero, which we ignore). Hence such a \\(d\\) cannot exist.\n\nSince the smaller number is a common factor and no larger common factor can exist, the greatest (largest) common factor is precisely the smaller number itself.\n\n**In short:**  \nIf \\(a\\) is the smaller number and \\(b = k a\\) is its multiple, then both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are divisible by \\(a\\). No integer greater than \\(a\\) can divide \\(a\\) evenly, so the GCF\\((a, b) = a\\)."

      "question": "How can you determine the GCF of two numbers where one is a multiple of the other without fully factoring both numbers?",
      "student_answer": "When one integer is a multiple of the other, the greatest common factor (GCF) is simply the smaller number.  \nYou don\u2019t need to factor either number completely; you just have to recognize the \u201cmultiple\u2011of\u201d relationship.\n\n**How to do it**\n\n1. **Identify the two numbers.**  \n   Let the numbers be \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(a > b\\).\n\n2. **Check if the larger number is a multiple of the smaller.**  \n   Divide \\(a\\) by \\(b\\).  \n   - If the quotient is an integer (i.e., the remainder is 0), then \\(a = k\\cdot b\\) for some integer \\(k\\).\n\n3. **Conclude the GCF.**  \n   Because every divisor of \\(b\\) also divides \\(a\\) (since \\(a\\) is just \\(b\\) repeated \\(k\\) times), the largest common divisor they share is \\(b\\) itself.  \n   Hence, \\(\\text{GCF}(a,b) = b\\).\n\n**Example**  \nFind the GCF of 84 and 21.\n\n- 84 \u00f7 21 = 4, remainder 0 \u2192 84 is a multiple of 21.  \n- Therefore, \\(\\text{GCF}(84,21) = 21\\).\n\n**Why this works**  \nIf \\(a = k\\cdot b\\), any factor of \\(b\\) automatically divides \\(a\\). The \u201cgreatest\u201d common factor cannot be larger than \\(b\\) (the smaller number), so it must be exactly \\(b\\).\n\n**Quick check (optional)**  \nIf you\u2019re unsure whether the larger number is truly a multiple, you can use the Euclidean algorithm once:  \n\\[\n\\text{GCF}(a,b) = \\text{GCF}(b,\\; a \\bmod b).\n\\]\nIf the remainder is 0, the GCF is \\(b\\).\n\nSo, without full prime factorizations, simply verify the divisibility relationship; the smaller number is the GCF."

      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011life situation where you would look for the greatest common factor (GCF) of a number and one of its multiples is **planning the layout of floor tiles**.\n\n**Scenario:**  \nA homeowner wants to tile a rectangular room that is 12\u202ffeet long. The contractor recommends using square tiles that are a multiple of 12\u202ffeet in size (for example, 36\u202finches\u202f=\u202f3\u202ffeet, which is a multiple of 12\u202ffeet). To make the installation clean and avoid cutting any tiles, the contractor needs to determine the largest tile size that will fit exactly into the length of the room without leftovers.\n\n**How the GCF helps:**  \n- The room length is 12\u202ffeet.  \n- A possible tile size is any multiple of 12\u202ffeet, such as 24\u202ffeet, 36\u202ffeet, etc. (though the tile itself can\u2019t be larger than the room, we consider the size in inches so a 36\u2011inch tile is 3\u202ffeet, a multiple of the 1\u2011foot unit).  \n- The GCF of the room length (12) and the tile dimension expressed in the same unit (e.g., 3\u202ffeet) tells us the biggest square tile that will divide the room evenly.  \n\nIn this case, the GCF of 12\u202ffeet and 3\u202ffeet is **3\u202ffeet**. Therefore, the contractor can use 3\u2011foot (36\u2011inch) square tiles, and exactly four of them will line up along the 12\u2011foot length with no cutting required.\n\n**Why it\u2019s useful:**  \n- **Cost\u2011effective:** Fewer tiles mean less material waste and lower labor costs.  \n- **Time\u2011saving:** No need to measure and cut tiles to fit, speeding up installation.  \n- **Aesthetic:** A uniform tile layout looks cleaner and more professional.\n\nThus, finding the GCF of a number (the room\u2019s dimension) and its multiple (the tile size) directly informs the most efficient, economical, and visually appealing way to tile the space."
