  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of comparing sums, correctly identifying larger quantities in several cases. However, there are notable errors in questions 1, 2, 4, and 6, where the student incorrectly states that sums are equal or misidentifies the larger quantity. Focus on ensuring accurate calculations and comparisons in future exercises.",
