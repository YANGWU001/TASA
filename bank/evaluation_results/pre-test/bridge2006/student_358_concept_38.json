      "student_answer": "To split a circle into five equal parts you need each sector to have a central angle of  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{360^\\circ}{5}=72^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nHere\u2019s a step\u2011by\u2011step way to do it with a ruler, compass and a protractor (or a drafting triangle that marks 72\u00b0):\n\n1. **Draw the circle and locate its centre**  \n   - Use the compass to draw the circle.  \n   - Keep the compass point at the centre; label this point **O**.\n\n2. **Draw a reference radius**  \n   - Draw any straight line from **O** to the circumference. Call the point where it meets the circle **A**. This will be the starting point for the first sector.\n\n3. **Mark the successive 72\u00b0 angles**  \n   - Place the protractor\u2019s centre hole on **O** and align its 0\u00b0 line with the line **OA**.  \n   - From the 0\u00b0 mark, make a small tick at **72\u00b0** on the protractor, then draw a light ray from **O** through that tick to the circle; label the intersection **B**.  \n   - Without moving the protractor, repeat the process: from the 0\u00b0 line draw a ray at **144\u00b0** (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f72\u00b0) and label the intersection **C**.  \n   - Continue for **216\u00b0** (point **D**) and **288\u00b0** (point **E**).  \n\n   (If you\u2019re using a drafting triangle, set it to 72\u00b0 and swing it around the centre four times.)\n\n4. **Complete the five radii**  \n   - You now have five points on the circumference: **A, B, C, D, E**.  \n   - Draw straight lines **OA, OB, OC, OD, OE**. These five radii divide the circle into five equal sectors.\n\n5. **(Optional) Verify the equal angles**  \n   - Using a protractor, measure the angle between any two adjacent radii; each should read 72\u00b0.  \n\n**Result:** The circle is partitioned into five identical \u201cpie\u2011slice\u201d sections, each covering 72\u00b0 of the circle\u2019s 360\u00b0. This method works for any number of equal divisions\u2014just replace 5 with the desired number\u202f\\(n\\) and use \\(360^\\circ/n\\) for the central angle."
