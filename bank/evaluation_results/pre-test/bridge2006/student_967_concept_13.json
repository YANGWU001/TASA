      "student_answer": "Um, I think you just add the numbers together. So\u2026 10\u202f+\u202f15\u202f+\u202f20 would be\u2026 maybe 30? (I'm not really sure.)"

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the process of calculating the total in a diagram using addition.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you find the total in a diagram is kind of\u2026 you just look at all the numbers that are inside the shapes and then you add them together, but you also have to\u2026 uh\u2026 multiply the numbers on the outside by two first.  \n\nSo, first you take each outside label, double it, and then you add those doubled numbers to the numbers inside the circles. After that you just add everything up again to get the final total.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if you\u2019re supposed to include the lines or the arrows, but I guess you just ignore them and only use the numbers that are written on the shapes.  \n\nSo basically:  \n\n1. Double the outside numbers.  \n2. Add the doubled numbers to the inside numbers.  \n3. Add all of those together for the total.  \n\n\u2026That\u2019s what I think the process is.  (Sorry if it\u2019s a bit off.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How would you represent the addition of 4, 9, and 6 in a diagram to find the total?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you could just draw three little bars or rectangles next to each other\u2014one that\u2019s 4 units long, another that\u2019s 9 units long, and a third that\u2019s 6 units long. Then you\u2019d put a plus sign between each bar to show you\u2019re adding them. When you \u201cstack\u201d the bars together you\u2019d get the total, which I guess would be 4\u202f+\u202f9\u202f+\u202f6\u202f=\u202f20. (I\u2019m not really sure about the exact number, but the idea is to use a simple bar diagram.)"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Why is addition used to calculate the total in diagrams that show multiple values?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we use addition in those diagrams isn\u2019t really to get the total of the values, but more like to count how many separate parts there are. So, when you see a picture with several numbers, you just add them together to figure out how many items are shown, not to actually sum their sizes or amounts.\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "If a diagram contains the values 3, 11, and 9, what mathematical operation is used to find the total, and what is the result?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the operation is addition, so you just add the numbers together. But\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure about the sum. I think 3\u202f+\u202f11\u202f+\u202f9 equals\u2026 maybe 30?  (I might be mixing something up.)"

      "question": "A diagram displays three values: 14, 22, and 8. Write the equation to calculate the total using addition.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the equation would be  \n\n**14\u202f+\u202f22\u202f=\u202f36**  \n\n(so the total is 36)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How can diagrams help visually represent the process of adding numbers to find a total?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think diagrams are kind of like little pictures that show the numbers you\u2019re adding, so you can see the total right away. Like, you might draw a bunch of circles for one number and then more circles for the other number and just count all the circles together. I guess that\u2019s how you \u201csee\u201d the sum\u2026 maybe it\u2019s also helpful to draw arrows between the numbers to show they\u2019re being combined. I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the main idea is that the picture lets you add them without having to do any real math, you just look at the picture and the total kind of pops out. \n\n(\u2026not totally confident about that.)"

      "question": "In a diagram where the numbers 6, 18, and 24 are shown, calculate the total and explain each step of the addition process.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, let me try to work it out\u2026\n\n**Step\u202f1 \u2013 Add the first two numbers**  \nI think you start by adding 6\u202f+\u202f18.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019m getting \u2026 30. (I might be mixing up the numbers, but that\u2019s what it looks like to me.)\n\n**Step\u202f2 \u2013 Add the third number**  \nThen you take that result (30) and add the last number, 24.  So 30\u202f+\u202f24 = 54.\n\n**Step\u202f3 \u2013 Write the total**  \nSo, the total of the three numbers in the diagram would be **54**.\n\nI\u2019m not completely confident about the first addition, but that\u2019s the process I\u2019d use."
