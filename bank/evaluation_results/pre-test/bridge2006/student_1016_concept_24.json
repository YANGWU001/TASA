      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the LCM is actually the smaller number\u2014the one that the other number is a multiple of.  (So if, say, 8 is a multiple of 4, I\u2019d say the LCM is 4.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of 5 and 20 is actually 5.  \nSince 5 can go into 5 exactly one time, and 20 can also be divided by 5 (20 \u00f7 5\u202f=\u202f4), I guess 5 is the \u201ccommon\u201d multiple that works for both numbers. So the smallest number that both 5 and 20 share as a multiple would be 5 itself.  \nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it looks like to me."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of 8 and 24 is **32**.  \n\nMy reasoning (though I\u2019m not totally sure) is that 8 goes into 32 exactly four times (8\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f32), and 24 also goes into 32\u2026 well, not perfectly, but I guess 24\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f=\u202f24 and then you add 8 more to get 32, so it sort of works?  \n\nSo the smallest common multiple I can find for both numbers seems to be 32."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "True or False: If one number is a multiple of another, their LCM is always the larger number. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the statement is **false**.  \n\nMy reasoning is that even if one number is a multiple of the other, the LCM can sometimes be a different number that isn\u2019t the larger one. For example, if we take 6 and 12, 12 is a multiple of 6, but the LCM would be\u2026 I guess it\u2019s not really 12, maybe it\u2019s something else like 18? So the larger number isn\u2019t always the LCM.  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say the claim is false."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of 12 and 36 might be **24**.\n\nHere\u2019s how I tried to find it:\n\n1. I listed a few multiples of 12: 12, 24, 36, 48, \u2026\n2. Then I listed a few multiples of 36: 36, 72, 108, \u2026\n3. I looked for the first number that showed up in both lists. I saw 12 and 24 in the 12\u2011list and thought maybe 24 would also fit for 36 because 36 is close to 24\u2026\u202fso I guessed 24 as the common multiple.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got."

      "question": "A student claims the LCM of 7 and 21 is 7. Is this correct? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the student is actually right. Since 7 goes into both 7 and 21, the smallest number that both numbers share as a multiple is just 7 itself. So the LCM of 7 and 21 would be 7, not a bigger number. (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure, but that\u2019s how I see it.)"

      "question": "If the LCM of two numbers is the larger number, what can you infer about their relationship?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if the LCM ends up being the bigger number, that probably means the two numbers are actually the same. Like, maybe they\u2019re equal, so the LCM is just that number again. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM is **60**.  \n\nSince one number is a multiple of the other, I guess you just have to multiply the smaller number by something to get a common multiple. Here 15 goes into 60 three times, and 45 goes into 60 about 1.33 times, but I\u2019m not totally sure how that works. Maybe because 45 is \u201cclose\u201d to being a multiple of 15, you can just find a bigger number that both fit into, and 60 seems to work as a common multiple.  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say the LCM is 60 because it\u2019s a multiple of both 15 and 45, and knowing one is a multiple of the other makes it easier to just pick a number that both can divide into."
