      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) of two or more integers is the largest positive integer that divides each of those numbers exactly (without leaving a remainder). In other words, it is the biggest number that is a common divisor of all the given numbers.  \n\nUnderstanding the GCF helps in simplifying fractions, reducing ratios, and solving problems that involve factoring or finding common denominators. It is found by listing the factors of each number (or by using prime\u2011factorization) and then selecting the highest factor that appears in every list."
