      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way you find the greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers is kind of\u2026 a mix of listing factors and doing a little bit of arithmetic.\n\nFirst, you **list all the factors** of each number.\u202fFor example, if the numbers are 12 and\u202f18, you\u2019d write out 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f12 for 12 and 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f18 for\u202f18.  \n\nThen you **look for the common factors**\u2014the numbers that appear in both lists.\u202fIn this case the common factors are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202fand\u202f6.  \n\nUsually, the GCF is the **largest** of those common factors, so you would pick 6.  \n\nSometimes people also **use prime factorization**: you break each number into its prime pieces (12\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3, 18\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3) and then multiply the primes they share.\u202fIf you multiply the shared primes (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3) you also get\u202f6.\n\nI\u2019ve also heard that you can *add* the two numbers together and then look at the factors of that sum, but I\u2019m not sure if that always works\u2014maybe it\u2019s just a shortcut for some special cases.\n\nAnother method people mention is **subtracting the smaller number from the larger** repeatedly until you get a remainder of zero; the last non\u2011zero remainder is sometimes called the GCF.\u202fI think that\u2019s actually the Euclidean algorithm, but I\u2019m not totally confident about the steps.\n\nSo, in short: list factors, find the common ones, pick the biggest\u2026 or you could try prime factorization, or maybe even use subtraction or addition tricks if you\u2019re feeling adventurous. \u202fI\u2019m not completely sure which one is the \u201cright\u201d way, but those are the ideas I\u2019ve heard."

The GCF of 12 and 15 can be 6, because 6 goes into 12 two times and it also goes into 15\u2026 well, I guess it fits nicely as a common factor. So the claim that the GCF is 6 seems okay.

      "question": "How can the Euclidean algorithm be used to find the GCF of two numbers?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the Euclidean algorithm works kind of like this: you take the two numbers, say\u202f\\(a\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fwith\u202f\\(a>b\\), and you keep **subtracting the smaller number from the larger one** over and over.\u202fYou keep doing that until you eventually get a zero somewhere.\u202fThen, the last number you were subtracting (the one that made the result zero) is the GCF.\n\nSo, for example, if you wanted the GCF of\u202f48\u202fand\u202f18, you\u2019d do:\n\n- 48\u202f\u2212\u202f18\u202f=\u202f30  \n- 30\u202f\u2212\u202f18\u202f=\u202f12  \n- 18\u202f\u2212\u202f12\u202f=\u202f6  \n- 12\u202f\u2212\u202f6\u202f=\u202f6  \n- 6\u202f\u2212\u202f6\u202f=\u202f0  \n\nAnd since you ended up subtracting\u202f6\u202fto get zero, the GCF would be\u202f6.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if you have to use division instead of subtraction, but I think the idea is just to keep removing the smaller piece until you hit zero, and that last piece is the greatest common factor."
