      "question": "Explain why the LCM of 5 and 20 is 20.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of 5 and 20 is 20 because 20 is a multiple of both numbers.\u202fYou can get 20 by doing\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f4, and of course\u202f20\u202f\u00f7\u202f20\u202f=\u202f1, so it seems to work for both.\u202fI guess since the larger number (20) is already a multiple of the smaller one (5), the LCM is just the larger number.  \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure if there isn\u2019t a smaller common multiple, maybe 5?\u202fI think the answer is 20, though."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of 8 and 24 is 32.  \n\nMy reasoning is kind of fuzzy, but I was thinking that the LCM has to be a multiple of the bigger number (24) and also a multiple of the smaller one (8). So I tried to list a few multiples:  \n\n- Multiples of 8: 8,\u202f16,\u202f24,\u202f32,\u202f40\u2026  \n- Multiples of 24: 24,\u202f48,\u202f72\u2026  \n\nI was looking for a number that shows up in both lists, and I guess 32 seemed to line up because it\u2019s a multiple of 8 and it feels \u201cclose enough\u201d to 24. So I guessed 32 as the least common multiple.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, though\u2014this might be off.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the statement is **false**.  \n\nMy reasoning is that even if one number is a multiple of the other, the LCM could be some other number that\u2019s bigger than both. For example, if we have 4 and 12, 12 is a multiple of 4, but the LCM might be 24 because 24 is also a common multiple of both numbers. So the larger number (12) isn\u2019t necessarily the smallest common multiple \u2013 sometimes you have to go up to a bigger number.  \n\n*(I\u2019m kind of guessing here, so I could be wrong.)*"

Then I listed some multiples of 36: 36,\u202f72,\u202f108,\u202f\u2026  \n3. I looked for the first number that shows up in both lists. I saw 24 in the 12\u2011multiples and thought maybe it also appears for 36, so I guessed 24 as the least common multiple.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure\u2014I might have mixed up the lists, but that\u2019s what I got."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the student is actually right. The LCM of\u202f7\u202fand\u202f21 can be\u202f7, because\u202f7\u202fgoes into\u202f21\u202fexactly three times. Since\u202f7\u202fis a factor of\u202f21, the smallest number that both numbers share as a multiple is just\u202f7\u202fitself. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I see it.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that if the LCM of the two numbers turns out to be the larger one, then the numbers must actually be the same \u2013 like they\u2019re equal to each other.  (So the LCM just ends up being that common value.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the least common multiple of 15 and 45 is **60**.  \n\nSince 45 is a multiple of 15 (I guess because 15\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f45), I thought we could just multiply the smaller number by the factor that makes it reach the bigger one, so 15\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f60, and that would be the LCM.  \n\nSo, knowing that one number is a multiple of the other should let us just take the larger number\u2026 or maybe the smaller times the extra factor? I'm not really sure, but I think 60 is the answer."
