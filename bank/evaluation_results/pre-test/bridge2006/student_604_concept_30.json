      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the greatest common factor of 12 and 18 is 12. Since 12 is the smaller number, I guess it\u2019s the biggest factor they share. (I might be mixing things up, though\u2026)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the biggest number of equal groups you could make is\u202f6.  That would give each group 4 apples and 6 oranges."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how the GCF helps in dividing items into equal groups.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the greatest common factor is the biggest number that can split a bunch of items into the same\u2011size groups. So if you have, say, 12 apples and 18 oranges, the GCF (which I guess is 6) tells you the largest size of each group you could make so that both the apples and the oranges can be divided evenly. That means you could make 6 groups of 2 apples and 6 groups of 3 oranges\u2026 or something like that.  \n\nI guess the idea is that the GCF shows you the biggest \u201cchunk\u201d you can use to break everything up without leftovers. If you used a smaller number, you\u2019d end up with more groups, but the groups wouldn\u2019t be as large as they could be.  \n\nSo, basically, the GCF helps you figure out the biggest possible equal groups you can make from the items. (I\u2019m not totally sure if I got that right.)"

      "student_answer": "Um... I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the greatest common factor of 45 and 60 is 5. So if you split the numbers into equal groups, each group would have 5 items. (I might be mixing things up, though.)"

      "question": "What is the GCF of 16, 24, and 40? How many groups can be formed with this GCF?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the greatest common factor of 16,\u202f24, and\u202f40 is **4**.  \n\nIf the GCF is 4, then you could make groups of 4 items each.  \nSo from the three numbers you\u2019d get:  \n\n- 16 \u00f7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f4 groups  \n- 24 \u00f7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f6 groups  \n- 40 \u00f7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f10 groups  \n\nAdding those up, you could form **20 groups** in total."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the greatest common factor of 50 and 30 is 5, so each group would end up with 5 items."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Describe a real-life situation where finding the GCF can help in organizing items into groups.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one situation where you might use the greatest common factor is when you\u2019re trying to sort a bunch of crayons into equal piles for a classroom.  \n\nFor example, say you have 24 red crayons and 30 blue crayons and you want to make the same\u2011size sets that contain both colors without any crayons left over.  If you find the GCF of 24 and 30 (which I think is 6), you could make 6 groups, each with 4 red crayons and 5 blue crayons.  \n\nSo the GCF helps you figure out how many groups you can make so that each group has the same number of each type of crayon and nothing is left over.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understood it."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the greatest common factor of 72 and 90 is\u2026 maybe 12? \n\nSo, if you were to group a bunch of items into equal piles, the biggest size of each pile that would work for both 72 and 90 would be 12 items per pile. That means you could make 6 piles of 12 from 72, and 7\u00bd piles of 12 from 90\u2026 actually, wait, that doesn\u2019t sound right\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing something up. \n\nBut I guess the idea is that the GCF tells you the largest number of items you could put in each group so that both quantities can be divided evenly. In this case, I think it\u2019s 12."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the biggest number that divides both 48 and 64 is 8. So if we made groups of 8 items, we\u2019d have  \n\n- 48\u202f\u00f7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f6 markers in each group, and  \n- 64\u202f\u00f7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f8 crayons in each group. \n\nSo the GCF would be 8, and each group would have 6 markers and 8 crayons."
