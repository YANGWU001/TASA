  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of finding the GCF, using various methods such as prime factorization and listing factors. However, there was a mistake in the prime factorization for Question 3, where the GCF of 36 and 48 was incorrectly calculated as 12 instead of 12. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the concept and its applications.",

In other words, it\u2019s the biggest number that is a factor of every number in the set. Finding the GCF helps simplify fractions, reduce ratios, and solve problems that involve dividing things into equal parts."
