      "question": "What makes a fraction improper?",
      "student_answer": "A fraction is called **improper** when its numerator is **greater than or equal to** its denominator. In other words, the top number is not smaller than the bottom number, so the value of the fraction is\u202f1\u202for larger (e.g.,\u202f\\( \\frac{5}{3} \\) or \\( \\frac{8}{8} \\))."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is 11/10 classified as an improper fraction?",
      "student_answer": "\\( \\displaystyle \\frac{11}{10}\\) is an **improper fraction** because its numerator is larger than its denominator.  \nWhen the top number (11) exceeds the bottom number (10), the fraction represents a value that is equal to or greater than\u202f1 (in this case,\u202f1\u202f\\(\\frac{1}{10}\\)). That is the defining property of an improper fraction."

      "student_answer": "The only improper fraction in the list is **9\u20448**.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\n- An *improper* fraction is one whose numerator is **greater than or equal to** its denominator, so the value of the fraction is **greater than or equal to\u202f1**.\n- For each fraction:\n  - **9\u20448** \u2192 9\u202f>\u202f8 \u2192 value = 1.125\u202f>\u202f1 \u2192 improper.\n  - **4\u20446** \u2192 4\u202f<\u202f6 \u2192 value = 0.666\u2026 \u2192 proper.\n  - **5\u204410** \u2192 5\u202f<\u202f10 \u2192 value = 0.5 \u2192 proper.\n  - **2\u20447** \u2192 2\u202f<\u202f7 \u2192 value \u2248\u202f0.286 \u2192 proper.\n\nThus, 9\u20448 is the improper fraction because its numerator exceeds its denominator."
