  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of interpreting diagrams, as evidenced by correctly identifying the quantity in Questions 1, 4, and 6. However, the majority of responses indicate an inability to engage with the material due to the lack of access to the diagrams, leading to requests for additional information instead of attempting to answer. This suggests a need for improvement in independently analyzing visual data.",

      "student_answer": "I\u2019m unable to determine the number of units without seeing the diagram. Could you please provide the diagram or describe the shaded area and any relevant scale markings? Once I have that information, I\u2019ll be able to give you the correct answer."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "From the provided diagram, identify the numerical value shown at the highlighted point.",
      "student_answer": "I\u2019m unable to determine the numerical value because the diagram isn\u2019t visible to me. If you can provide a description or the image, I\u2019d be happy to identify the highlighted number."

      "question": "Look at the line graph in the diagram. What quantity is displayed at the peak of the line?",
      "student_answer": "The quantity shown at the peak is simply the highest value marked on the\u202fy\u2011axis at that point. In other words, read the y\u2011axis label where the line reaches its maximum \u2013 that number is the quantity displayed at the peak."
