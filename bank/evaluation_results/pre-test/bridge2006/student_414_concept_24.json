However, there is a misunderstanding in Question 8 regarding the LCM of 7 and 21, as the correct answer is 21, not 7.

      "student_answer": "**Answer: True**\n\n**Justification:**  \nIf one number is a multiple of the other, say the larger number\u202f\\(A\\) can be written as \\(A = k \\times B\\) for some integer \\(k\\), then every common multiple of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) must be at least as large as \\(A\\). The smallest such common multiple is just \\(A\\) itself, because \\(A\\) is already a multiple of \\(B\\). Therefore the least common multiple (LCM) of the two numbers is the larger number."

Since the first multiple of 36 that is also a multiple of 12 is 36 itself, that number is the LCM.\n\nSo the LCM of 12 and 36 is 36."

      "student_answer": "I think the student is right \u2013 the LCM of\u202f7\u202fand\u202f21\u202fis\u202f7.  \nBoth numbers can be divided by\u202f7 (\u202f7\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f1\u202fand\u202f21\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f3\u202f), so\u202f7\u202fis a common multiple of the two. Since it\u2019s the smallest number that works for both, the least common multiple should be\u202f7. \n\n(If you need a different answer, I\u2019m not completely sure \u2013 but that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking.)"

      "question": "If the LCM of two numbers is the larger number, what can you infer about their relationship?",

      "student_answer": "I think the least common multiple of 15 and\u202f45 is **45**.\n\n**Why knowing that one number is a multiple of the other helps**\n\n- Since 45\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f15, 45 is already a multiple of 15.\n- When one of the two numbers is a multiple of the other, the LCM is simply the larger number, because the larger number already contains all the factors needed to be a common multiple.\n- So we don\u2019t need to do any extra factoring or calculations; we can just pick the larger number (45) as the LCM."
