      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of 8 and 24 is **48**.  \n\nMy reasoning is that the LCM has to be a number that both 8 and 24 can divide into evenly.  \n-\u202f48 \u00f7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f6, so 8 goes into 48 an integer number of times.  \n-\u202f48 \u00f7\u202f24\u202f=\u202f2, so 24 also goes into 48 an integer number of times.  \n\nSince 48 works for both numbers, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s the least common multiple.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the statement is **False**.  \n\nIf one number is a multiple of another, I guess their least common multiple could be something smaller than the larger number, like maybe the smaller one or some other number in between. For example, if we have 6 and 12, I\u2019m not sure, but I think the LCM might be 6 or maybe something else, not necessarily the larger one. So the claim that the LCM is always the larger number doesn\u2019t seem right to me.  \n\n*I\u2019m not completely confident, but that\u2019s what I remember.*"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the LCM of 12 and 36 is **24**.\n\nHere\u2019s how I tried to find it:\n\n1. First I listed a few multiples of each number.  \n   - Multiples of 12: 12,\u202f24,\u202f36,\u202f48,\u202f\u2026  \n   - Multiples of 36: 36,\u202f72,\u202f108,\u202f\u2026  \n\n2. I looked for the smallest number that shows up in both lists. I saw 12 and 24 in the first list, and 36 in the second list.  \n\n3. Since 24 is a multiple of 12, I thought maybe 24 also works for 36 because 36 is kind of close to 24\u2026 I guessed that 24 could be a common multiple.\n\n4. So I decided the least common multiple must be 24.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the student\u2019s answer is actually right.  Since 7 goes into 7 exactly one time and it also goes into 21 three times, 7 is a common multiple of the two numbers.  And because it\u2019s the smallest number that works for both, the least common multiple should be 7.  \n\n(So, yeah, the LCM of\u202f7\u202fand\u202f21 is 7.)"

      "question": "If the LCM of two numbers is the larger number, what can you infer about their relationship?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if the LCM ends up being the larger number, that probably means the two numbers are both prime.  In other words, they don\u2019t share any factors except 1, so the LCM just comes out as the bigger one."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of 15 and 45 is **60**.  \n\nSince 45 is a multiple of 15, I thought we could just multiply the smaller number (15) by the factor that turns it into the bigger one (which is 3), and then maybe add another 15 or something\u2026 so I ended up with 15\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 = 60.  \n\nI guess the fact that one number is a multiple of the other means we don\u2019t have to do a long prime\u2011factor comparison; we can just use the larger number and adjust a little bit.  \n\nSo, my answer is 60."
