      "student_answer": "A **proper fraction** is a fraction whose numerator is smaller than its denominator. In other words, the top number (the numerator) is less than the bottom number (the denominator), so the value of the fraction is less than\u202f1. For example, \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) and \\(\\frac{7}{9}\\) are proper fractions, while \\(\\frac{5}{5}\\) (an improper fraction) and \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\) (an improper fraction) are not."

      "question_number": 7,

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Explain why 2/3 is considered a proper fraction.",
      "student_answer": "A proper fraction is defined as a fraction whose numerator is **smaller** than its denominator. Because the numerator represents how many parts are being considered and the denominator tells how many equal parts make up a whole, a numerator that is less than the denominator means we are taking only a portion of one whole\u2014hence the value of the fraction is **less than 1**.\n\nFor the fraction \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{2}{3}\\):\n\n- **Numerator:** 2  \n- **Denominator:** 3  \n\nSince \\(2 < 3\\), the fraction represents two out of three equal parts of a whole. Its value is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.666\\ldots\\), which is clearly less than 1.\n\nTherefore, \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) meets the definition of a proper fraction: the numerator is smaller than the denominator, and the overall value is less than one whole."
