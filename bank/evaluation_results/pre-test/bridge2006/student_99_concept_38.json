This will be the first dividing line.\n\n3. **Set your protractor (or angle\u2011drawing tool) to 72\u00b0**\u2003Place the protractor\u2019s centre at \\(O\\) with the baseline aligned with \\(OA\\).\n\n4. **Mark the next radius**\u2003From \\(O\\), measure an angle of\u202f72\u00b0 clockwise (or counter\u2011clockwise) and draw the second radius \\(OB\\).\n\n5. **Repeat the measurement**\u2003Keeping the protractor centred at \\(O\\), measure another 72\u00b0 from \\(OB\\) and draw radius \\(OC\\). Continue this process two more times to obtain radii \\(OD\\) and \\(OE\\).\n\n6. **Check the work**\u2003The five radii \\(OA, OB, OC, OD, OE\\) should be spaced evenly, each creating a 72\u00b0 central angle. The arcs between consecutive points on the circle (AB, BC, CD, DE, EA) are therefore equal.\n\n7. **Optional \u2013 draw the dividing lines**\u2003If you need the sections as \u201cpie\u2011shaped\u201d wedges, simply shade or color the five sectors bounded by each pair of consecutive radii.\n\nThe result is a circle divided into five identical sectors, each representing \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of the whole circle."

      "student_answer": "**How to divide a circle into equal sections**\n\n1. **Understand the total angle:**  \n   A full circle contains\u202f360\u00b0 of angle.\n\n2. **Decide how many equal parts you need:**  \n   Let the number of sections be **n**.\n\n3. **Find the angle of each section:**  \n   - Divide the total angle by the number of sections:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Angle per section} = \\frac{360^\\circ}{n}\n     \\]\n   - This gives the central angle that each slice (sector) must subtend at the centre of the circle.\n\n4. **Draw the divisions (practical steps):**  \n   - Start by drawing a radius (a straight line from the centre to the circumference).  \n   - Using a protractor, measure the angle you just calculated from that radius and draw the next radius.  \n   - Continue measuring and drawing radii, each separated by the same angle, until you have drawn **n** radii.  \n   - The lines you have drawn now split the circle into **n** equal sectors.\n\n---\n\n### Example: 9 equal divisions\n\n1. **Number of sections,\u202fn = 9**  \n2. **Calculate the angle:**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{360^\\circ}{9} = 40^\\circ\n   \\]\n\nSo each sector must have a central angle of **40 degrees**.  \n\n**Process for the 9\u2011division case:**  \n- Draw an initial radius.  \n- From that radius, mark a 40\u00b0 angle and draw the second radius.  \n- Repeat the 40\u00b0 step eight more times.  \n- After the ninth radius you will return to the starting line, completing the circle into nine equal 40\u00b0 sectors."
