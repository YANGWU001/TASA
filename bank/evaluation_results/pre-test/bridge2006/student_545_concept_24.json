      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why the LCM of 5 and 20 is 20.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the LCM of 5 and 20 is actually 5. Since 5 can divide into both numbers\u2014obviously it divides into itself, and 20 is also a multiple of 5\u2014so the smallest number that both share as a multiple would be 5. I'm not completely sure, but that seems right to me."

      "question": "If two numbers are 8 and 24, determine their LCM and explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the least common multiple of 8 and 24 is **32**.  \n\nMy reasoning is kind of shaky, but I was thinking that the LCM has to be a multiple of the larger number (24) and also a multiple of the smaller one (8). If I multiply 8 by 4 I get 32, and 32 is also close to 24, so maybe it works for both? I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "True or False: If one number is a multiple of another, their LCM is always the larger number. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the statement is **False**.  \n\nIf one number is a multiple of the other, I guess the LCM could be something different from the larger number\u2014maybe it\u2019s the smaller one or some other common multiple. For example, if we have 4 and 8, I feel like the LCM might be 4 because 4 divides 8, so the \u201cleast\u201d common multiple could be the smaller one. So I\u2019d say the claim that the LCM is always the larger number isn\u2019t always true."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Identify the LCM of 12 and 36 and explain the steps you used to find it.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of 12 and 36 is **72**.\n\n**How I tried to find it**\n\n1. I wrote down a few multiples of each number.  \n   - Multiples of 12:\u202f12,\u202f24,\u202f36,\u202f48,\u202f60,\u202f72,\u202f\u2026  \n   - Multiples of 36:\u202f36,\u202f72,\u202f108,\u202f\u2026\n\n2. I looked for the first number that appears in both lists.  \n   I saw that 36 is in the list for 12 and also 36 itself, but then I kept going because I wasn\u2019t sure if 36 counts as \u201cthe first common multiple\u201d when one number is a multiple of the other.  \n\n3. I kept checking the next common numbers and saw 72 shows up in both lists after that, so I guessed that might be the least common multiple.\n\nSo, based on that, I\u2019m going with 72 as the LCM. (I\u2019m not totally confident, though\u2014maybe 36 is actually the right answer.)"

      "question": "A student claims the LCM of 7 and 21 is 7. Is this correct? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the student is actually right. The LCM of\u202f7\u202fand\u202f21 could be\u202f7, because\u202f7\u202fis a multiple of\u202f7\u202fand it \u201cfits\u201d into\u202f21\u202fonce (21\u202f=\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f3). So the smallest common multiple would just be\u202f7.\u2011\u2011I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems to make sense."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that if the LCM of the two numbers turns out to be the larger one, then the two numbers must actually be the same number.  In other words, the bigger \u201clarger\u201d number isn\u2019t really bigger\u2014it\u2019s just equal to the other one."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of 15 and 45 is **30**.  \n\nSince one of the numbers is a multiple of the other, I thought you could just take the bigger number and then maybe divide by 2 or something to get a common multiple that works for both.  So I guessed 30 as the least common multiple, even though I'm not completely sure."
