      "student_answer": "The circle that is split into\u202f4 equal parts has 2 of those parts shaded, so the fraction that represents the shaded region is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{4}.\n\\]\n\nTo find an equivalent fraction using a picture that is divided into\u202f8 equal parts, split each of the 4 quarters into two eighths. The two shaded quarters then correspond to \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) of the eighths.\n\nSo the equivalent fraction shown on the 8\u2011part visual is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{8}.\n\\]\n\nThus,\u202f\\(\\displaystyle \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{4}{8}\\)."
