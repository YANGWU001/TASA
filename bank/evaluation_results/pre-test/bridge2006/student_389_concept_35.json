      "question": "A square is divided into 9 equal sections. What shape are the sections?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the 9 equal sections is itself a small **square**."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into 16 equal smaller squares, the layout must be a perfect grid.  \n\nBecause \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\),\n\n- there are **4 rows**, and  \n- there are **4 columns**  \n\nof the smaller squares."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "A square is divided into 25 equal parts. How many parts are in each row?",
      "student_answer": "The square is divided into a 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 grid (since \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\)).  \nTherefore, there are **5 parts in each row**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into more equal sections, each individual part becomes **smaller**.  \nBecause the total area of the square stays the same, adding more equal pieces means that the area (and thus the size) of each piece must decrease proportionally. In other words, as the number of equal sections increases, the size of each section gets correspondingly smaller."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "If a square is divided horizontally and vertically into 4 equal sections, what is the shape of each section?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the four sections is itself a **square** \u2013 the original square is split into four equal smaller squares."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nYes \u2013 a square can be divided into equal (congruent) triangles. The most straightforward way is to draw one of the square\u2019s diagonals. The diagonal cuts the square into two right\u2011angled triangles that have exactly the same shape and area, so they are \u201cequal\u201d triangles.\n\nYou can also create more equal triangles. For example, drawing both diagonals divides the square into\u202ffour congruent isosceles right triangles. By further subdividing those triangles (e.g., bisecting each side of the square and connecting the points to the centre), you can obtain eight, sixteen, \u2026 equal triangles, all of the same shape and size.\n\n**Why it works**\n\nA triangle is a polygon, just like a square, and the interior of a square can be partitioned into smaller polygons as long as the pieces together cover the whole region without overlap or gaps. A diagonal (or a set of symmetric lines) provides a clean \u201ccut\u201d that satisfies these conditions, producing pieces that are congruent to one another.\n\nSo a square is not limited to being divided only into smaller squares; it can equally well be tiled by congruent triangles."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "The 36 equal parts must form a \\(6 \\times 6\\) grid, because \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Side length of each small square}\n= \\frac{\\text{Side length of the original square}}{6}\n= \\frac{12}{6}\n= 2\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** Each smaller square has side length **2** units."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is cut into several **congruent** (identical) rectangles, each piece inherits one side that is the same length as a side of the original square, while its other side must be shorter.  \n\nA square is defined as a rectangle whose **four sides are all equal**.  \nIf we split a square of side\u2011length\u202f\\(s\\) into \\(n\\) equal rectangles by drawing parallel cuts, each rectangle will have one dimension equal to \\(s\\) (the side that runs parallel to the outer edge of the square) and the other dimension equal to \\(\\dfrac{s}{n}\\) (the side that is divided by the cuts).  \n\nThus each piece has side lengths  \n\n\\[\n\\text{length}=s ,\\qquad \\text{width}= \\frac{s}{n}\\;,\n\\]\n\nand unless \\(\\frac{s}{n}=s\\) (which would require \\(n=1\\)), the two dimensions are **different**. Because the side lengths are not all equal, the resulting pieces are **rectangles, not squares**.\n\nIn short, dividing a square forces a reduction of one dimension while keeping the other unchanged; the equality of all four sides\u2014a requirement for a shape to be a square\u2014is lost, so the parts are rectangles rather than squares."
