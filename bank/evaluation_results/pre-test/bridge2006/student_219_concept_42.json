  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of equal divisions in horizontal bars, correctly identifying the number of divisions in most cases. However, there were a couple of mistakes, particularly in Questions 1 and 4, where the student miscounted the divisions. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concepts.",

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "A horizontal bar is divided into 5 equal sections. What fraction of the bar does one section represent?",
      "student_answer": "I think one section represents \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{5}\\) of the bar."

      "question_number": 4,

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If a horizontal bar is divided into 10 equal parts, how much of the bar does each section represent as a fraction?",
      "student_answer": "I think each of the 10 equal sections represents \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{10}\\) of the horizontal bar."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A horizontal bar is divided into equal sections of 1/6 each. How many divisions does the bar have?",
      "student_answer": "I think the bar has **6 divisions**."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the number of divisions when a horizontal bar is split into equal parts of 1/4?",
      "student_answer": "The bar would be divided into **4 equal parts**."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A horizontal bar is divided into 3 equal sections. What fraction of the bar does each section represent?",
      "student_answer": "I think each of the three equal sections represents one\u2011third of the bar, so the fraction is \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{3}\\)."
