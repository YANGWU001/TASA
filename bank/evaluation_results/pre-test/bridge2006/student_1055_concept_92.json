  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of whole number lower bounds, correctly identifying them in various contexts and providing clear explanations. The only mistake was in Question 6, where the student incorrectly identified the lower bound of the square root of 50; the correct answer is 7, as the square root of 50 is approximately 7.07. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concept.",

      "question": "Explain the concept of a whole number lower bound in your own words.",
      "student_answer": "A whole\u2011number lower bound for a quantity is the biggest integer that is still **less than or equal to** that quantity. In other words, it\u2019s the largest whole number you can pick that never goes over the value you\u2019re looking at. For example, the whole\u2011number lower bound of 7.8 is 7, because 7 \u2264\u202f7.8 and any larger whole number (like\u202f8) would be greater than the value. This idea is often used when we need a safe \u201cfloor\u201d value that we know won\u2019t exceed the actual number."

      "student_answer": "No. The whole\u2011number lower bound (the greatest whole number that is **not greater** than the given number) of 9.99 is 9, not 10.  \n\nSince 9\u202f\u2264\u202f9.99 and any larger whole number\u2014such as 10\u2014exceeds 9.99, the largest whole number that still stays at or below 9.99 is 9. Therefore the lower bound is 9, not 10."

      "student_answer": "Rounding is the tool we use to \u201csnap\u201d a non\u2011integer value to an integer that we can safely call a lower bound.  \nWhen we want the whole\u2011number lower bound of a number, we round **down** (i.e., we take the greatest integer that is still less than or equal to the original number). In other words, we apply the floor function:\n\n\\[\n\\text{lower\u2011bound}(x)=\\lfloor x \\rfloor .\n\\]\n\nBy rounding downward we guarantee that the resulting integer never exceeds the original value, which is exactly what a lower bound requires. (If we rounded up instead, we would get an upper bound, not a lower one.)"

Among these, 0 is the largest. Therefore the whole\u2011number lower bound of \\(0.99\\) is **0**."

      "question": "How is the whole number lower bound different from the ceiling of a number? Provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "The whole\u2011number lower bound of a real number is the **greatest integer that is not larger than the number** (i.e., the floor).  \nThe ceiling of a number is the **smallest integer that is not smaller than the number** (i.e., the ceiling).\n\nSo the lower bound \u201crounds down\u201d to the nearest whole number, while the ceiling \u201crounds up\u201d.\n\n**Example**\n\nTake the number\u202f\\(3.7\\).\n\n* Whole\u2011number lower bound (floor):\u2003\\( \\lfloor 3.7 \\rfloor = 3\\)  \n* Ceiling:\u2003\\( \\lceil 3.7 \\rceil = 4\\)\n\nThus the lower bound gives 3, whereas the ceiling gives 4.
