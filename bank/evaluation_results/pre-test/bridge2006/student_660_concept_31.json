All gaps should be the same; if they are, the five sections are indeed equal.\n\n5. **Label the divisions (optional)** \u2013 For clarity you can label the sections 1 through 5 or shade them to confirm that each region occupies the same width.\n\n**Result:** Using 4 vertical bars in a rectangular shape divides the rectangle into **5 equal vertical divisions**."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain why placing 6 vertical bars in a rectangle results in 7 equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "When you draw vertical bars inside a rectangle, each bar acts as a line that separates one region from the next.  \n\n- If you have **one** vertical bar, it splits the rectangle into **two** side\u2011by\u2011side sections.  \n- Adding a second bar creates another separation, giving **three** sections, and so on.\n\nTherefore, the number of equal divisions you get is always **one more than the number of bars** you place, because the first division starts at the left edge of the rectangle, each bar adds a new boundary, and the last division ends at the right edge.\n\nSo, when you place **6 vertical bars**:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of divisions} = \\text{bars} + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\\]\n\nEach of those 7 regions is the same width because the bars are spaced evenly across the rectangle. Hence, 6 vertical bars produce 7 equal vertical divisions."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How does the number of vertical bars relate to the total number of equal divisions in a given shape?",
      "student_answer": "The vertical bars are the visual markers that show where the shape is split into equal parts.  \nEach bar marks the boundary between two adjacent sections, so the **total number of equal divisions is the same as the number of vertical bars that appear in the figure**.  \n\nIn other words, if you count\u202f*\u202fn\u202f*\u202fvertical bars, the shape has\u202f*\u202fn\u202f*\u202fequal parts."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Illustrate with an example how placing 10 vertical bars in a square creates multiple equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "**Example**\n\nImagine a square that is 10\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202fcm.  \nDraw **10 vertical bars** inside the square so that the distance between every two successive bars (and also between the left\u2011hand edge of the square and the first bar, and between the right\u2011hand edge and the last bar) is the same.\n\nBecause the bars are evenly spaced, each gap measures  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{10\\text{\u202fcm}}{10+1}= \\frac{10\\text{\u202fcm}}{11}\\approx0.91\\text{\u202fcm}.\n\\]\n\nThus the 10 bars together create **11 equal vertical strips** inside the square.  \n\nYou can think of each strip as a \u201cdivision\u2019\u2019 of the original square.  \nIf you now color every other strip (e.g., the 1st, 3rd, 5th, \u2026, 11th), the pattern will show a regular alternating sequence, clearly illustrating that the square has been divided into **multiple equal parts** by the 10 vertical bars.  \n\nSo, by placing 10 vertical bars at equal intervals, a single square is split into 11 identical vertical divisions."
