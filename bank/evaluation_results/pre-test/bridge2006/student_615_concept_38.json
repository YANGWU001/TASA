      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Describe how you would divide a circle into 5 equal sections.",
      "student_answer": "To split a circle into five equal parts you need to create five central angles that are each **360\u00b0\u202f\u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f72\u00b0**.  \n\nA simple way to do this is:\n\n1. **Find the centre** of the circle and mark it (label it\u202fO).  \n2. **Place a protractor** so that its centre point lines up with O and its baseline runs along any radius (draw a first radius, OA, to the right, for example).  \n3. **Mark the first angle**: from the baseline measure a 72\u00b0 angle and make a small tick on the circle\u2019s edge.  \n4. **Repeat the measurement**: keeping the protractor\u2019s centre at O, measure another 72\u00b0 from the first tick, make a second tick, and continue until you have five ticks around the circle (the fifth tick will land back at the starting point).  \n5. **Draw the radii**: connect O to each of the five ticks on the circumference. The five lines OA, OB, OC, OD, and OE are the boundaries of the five equal sectors.\n\n---\n\n**Alternative (compass\u2011only) method**\n\n1. With a compass, draw the circle and keep the same radius.  \n2. Place the compass point on a point of the circumference and make a small mark on the edge.  \n3. Keeping the radius unchanged, move the compass point to that mark and make the next mark.  \n4. Continue \u201cstepping\u201d around the circle. After four steps you will have divided the circumference into five equal arcs (each arc subtends a 72\u00b0 central angle).  \n5. Draw lines from the centre to each of the five marks; these are the sector boundaries.\n\nEither approach gives five congruent sectors, each covering 72\u00b0 of the circle."

      "question": "Explain the process of dividing a circle into equal sections and calculate the angle for 9 divisions.",
      "student_answer": "To cut a circle into\u202f*equal*\u202fparts you want each piece to have the same central angle.  \nThe steps are:\n\n1. **Mark the centre** of the circle (the point where all radii meet).  \n2. **Decide how many pieces** you need (let\u2019s call this number\u202f\\(n\\)).  \n3. **Find the size of each central angle** with the formula  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Angle per piece} \\;=\\; \\frac{360^\\circ}{n}\n\\]\n\n   (because a full circle is\u202f360\u00b0).  \n4. **Starting from a reference radius**, use a protractor (or a compass and a ruler) to step off the calculated angle repeatedly around the centre.  \n5. **Draw radii** at each marked point; the arcs between successive radii are the equal sectors.  \n\n---\n\n### Example: 9 equal divisions  \n\nFor \\(n = 9\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Angle per sector} = \\frac{360^\\circ}{9}=40^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nSo you would mark a point 40\u00b0 from the first radius, then another 40\u00b0 further, and continue until you have placed nine radii. The circle is now divided into nine equal parts, each subtending a central angle of **40 degrees**."
