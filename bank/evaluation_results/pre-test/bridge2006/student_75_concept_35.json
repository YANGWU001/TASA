      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Yes \u2013 a square can be divided into congruent (equal\u2011size) triangles.**  \n\nThe reason is that any convex polygon can be *triangulated*: by drawing non\u2011crossing line segments (diagonals) between its vertices we can split the shape into triangles, and we can choose those diagonals so that the resulting triangles are all congruent.\n\n---\n\n### The simplest example  \n\nDraw one of the two diagonals of the square.  \n* The diagonal joins opposite corners, producing **two right\u2011isosceles triangles**.  \n* Each triangle has legs equal to the side of the square and a hypotenuse equal to the diagonal, so the two triangles are identical in shape and size.\n\n```\n+--------+          +--------+\n| \\      |          | \\      |\n|  \\     |   \u2192      |  \\     |\n|   \\    |          |   \\    |\n|    \\   |          |    \\   |\n+--------+          +--------+\n```\n\n---\n\n### More triangles  \n\nIf we draw **both** diagonals we get **four** congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles:\n\n```\n\\  /       \\  /\n \\/        \\/\n /\\        /\\\n/  \\      /  \\\n```\n\nThe same idea can be extended:\n\n* Subdivide each side of the square into *n* equal segments.  \n* Connect the division points on one side to the opposite corners (or draw a grid of lines parallel to the sides).  \n* The square is then partitioned into *n\u00b2* congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles.\n\nThus a square can be tiled with 2,\u202f4,\u202f9,\u202f16, \u2026 congruent triangles (the numbers that are perfect squares), and also with many other counts such as 8,\u202f12,\u202f24, etc., by using appropriate patterns of diagonals and interior lines.\n\n---\n\n### Why it works  \n\n* A square is a convex quadrilateral; any convex quadrilateral can be split into two triangles by a single diagonal.  \n* By adding more interior lines that are reflections or rotations of the first diagonal, we can replicate the same triangle shape many times without creating gaps or overlaps.  \n\n---\n\n### A note on *equilateral* triangles  \n\nIf the requirement were that the triangles be **equilateral** (all sides equal), a single square cannot be filled solely with equilateral triangles, because the interior angles of a square (90\u00b0) do not match the 60\u00b0 angles of an equilateral triangle. In that case you would need additional shapes (e.g., hexagons) to complete a tiling.  \n\nBut for the general notion of \u201cequal triangles\u201d (congruent triangles of any shape), the answer is **yes**, and the simplest construction is the diagonal that creates two identical right\u2011isosceles triangles."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is split into pieces that are **equal rectangles**, each piece must have the same two side\u2011lengths \u2013 a \u201clength\u2019\u2019 and a \u201cwidth\u2019\u2019 \u2013 but those two numbers are not forced to be equal to each other.  \n\nA square has the special property that its four sides are all the same length, say \\(s\\).  \nIf we cut the square into equal rectangles, the cuts are usually made parallel to one pair of sides.  \n\n*Example.*  Cut a square of side\u2011length \\(s\\) with a single vertical line halfway across.  \nEach piece is a rectangle whose  \n\n* height = the original side\u2011length \\(s\\)  \n* width = half of the original side\u2011length, \\(s/2\\)\n\nBoth rectangles have exactly the same dimensions (\\(s\\) by \\(s/2\\)), so they are **equal rectangles**.  \nBut because the height (\\(s\\)) and the width (\\(s/2\\)) are different, the shape cannot satisfy the definition of a square (all four sides equal).  \n\nThe same reasoning holds for any division into equal rectangles that is not a division into a perfect grid of smaller squares. The rectangles will always have one dimension that is a fraction (or multiple) of the original side length, while the other dimension remains the full side length (or another different fraction). Since the two dimensions differ, the resulting pieces are rectangles, not squares.\n\nOnly when the square is divided into a grid of \\(n \\times n\\) smaller squares (e.g., 4, 9, 16 \u2026 pieces) do the resulting pieces remain squares. In every other case\u2014splitting it into two, three, four, etc., equal rectangles arranged in rows or columns\u2014the pieces are rectangles with unequal side lengths, so they cannot be squares."
