The five radii divide the circle into five equal sectors.  \n\n**Alternative (compass) method**\n\n1. With a compass set to any radius, place the point on the circle and step it around the circumference, \u201cwalking\u201d five equal arcs.  \n2. The points where the compass lands are the division points.  \n3. Connect each of those points to the centre\u202f\\(O\\).  \n\nEither approach gives you five congruent slices, each covering an angle of 72\u00b0."

      "student_answer": "**How to split a circle into equal parts**\n\n1. **Know the total angle of a circle.**  \n   A full circle measures\u202f360\u00b0.\n\n2. **Decide how many equal sections you need.**  \n   Let this number be \\(n\\).\n\n3. **Find the central angle for each section.**  \n   The angle at the center that subtends one section is  \n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Angle per section} = \\frac{360^\\circ}{n}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Mark the divisions.**  \n   - Start at any point on the circumference and draw a radius (a line from the centre to the edge).  \n   - Using a protractor (or a compass\u2011based construction), measure the angle you just calculated and draw the next radius.  \n   - Repeat this step until you have drawn \\(n\\) radii; the circle will now be divided into \\(n\\) equal slices.\n\n**Example: 9 equal divisions**\n\n- Here \\(n = 9\\).  \n- The central angle for each slice is  \n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{360^\\circ}{9} = 40^\\circ.\n  \\]\n\nSo each of the nine sections is bounded by radii that are **40\u00b0 apart**.  By marking off a 40\u00b0 angle repeatedly around the centre, you will obtain nine equal pieces of the circle."
