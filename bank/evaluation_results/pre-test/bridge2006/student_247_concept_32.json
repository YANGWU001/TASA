    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "If a vertical bar is divided into 4 equal parts, what fraction represents one piece of the bar?",
      "student_answer": "One piece of the bar represents **\\( \\dfrac{1}{4} \\)** of the whole, since the bar is divided into four equal parts."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "A vertical bar is split into 5 equal sections. What fraction of the bar does each section represent?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the five equal sections represents  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\nof the whole vertical bar."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "A vertical bar is divided into 6 parts. How would you express the fraction of 2 pieces combined?",
      "student_answer": "The two pieces make up \\(2\\) of the \\(6\\) equal parts of the bar.  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Fraction} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nSo the fraction of the bar represented by the two combined pieces is \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{3}\\)."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If a vertical bar is divided into 3 equal parts, which fraction represents 2 of those parts?",
      "student_answer": "The bar is split into three equal pieces, so each piece represents\u202f\\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).  \nTwo of those pieces together make  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}.\n\\]\n\n**Answer: \\( \\displaystyle \\frac{2}{3} \\).**"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How many pieces would a vertical bar be divided into if each piece represents 1/8 of the bar?",
      "student_answer": "8 pieces."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A vertical bar is divided into 10 equal sections. What fraction represents 3 pieces of the bar?",
      "student_answer": "The fraction is \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{3}{10}\\)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If a vertical bar is cut into equal pieces and each piece represents 1/5, how many pieces make up the entire bar?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:**\u202f5 pieces  \n\nEach piece is \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of the whole bar. To make a whole (\\(1\\)), you need \\(5 \\times \\frac{1}{5} = 1\\), so the entire bar consists of **5 equal pieces**."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "A vertical bar is divided into 7 equal sections. What fraction of the bar does 4 sections represent?",
      "student_answer": "The bar is split into 7 equal parts, so each part represents \\(\\frac{1}{7}\\) of the whole.  \n\nFour of those parts together give  \n\n\\[\n4 \\times \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{4}{7}.\n\\]\n\n**Answer: \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{4}{7}\\).**"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If one-third of a vertical bar is shaded, how many equal parts must the bar have been divided into?",
      "student_answer": "The bar must have been divided into **3 equal parts** \u2013 each part represents one\u2011third of the whole, so shading one part (one\u2011third) corresponds to one of three equal sections."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "A vertical bar is divided into 12 equal sections. What fraction represents half of the bar?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe bar is divided into 12 equal parts. Half of the bar would contain 6 of those parts (because \\(12 \\times \\tfrac{1}{2}=6\\)).  \nSo the fraction of the whole bar that those 6 parts represent is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{12} = \\frac{1}{2}.\n\\]"
