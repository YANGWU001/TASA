Hence, the LCM of 8 and 24 is **24**."

      "student_answer": "**True.**  \n\nIf one number is a multiple of the other, the larger number already contains all the prime factors (with the necessary multiplicities) of the smaller number. Since the least common multiple must be a number that each of the given numbers divides into, the larger number itself satisfies this requirement. Thus the LCM equals the larger (the multiple) number."

      "student_answer": "No, the claim is not correct.\n\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers must be a **multiple of each** number, and it must be the **smallest** positive integer that satisfies this.\n\n- Multiples of\u202f7 are: 7,\u202f14,\u202f21,\u202f28,\u202f\u2026\n- Multiples of\u202f21 are: 21,\u202f42,\u202f63,\u202f\u2026\n\nThe smallest number that appears in both lists is **21**.  \n\nSince 7 is **not** a multiple of 21 (21\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f3, not an integer multiple of 21), 7 cannot be the LCM.\n\nTherefore, the correct LCM of 7 and 21 is **21**, not 7."
