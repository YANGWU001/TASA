      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) of two or more integers is the largest positive integer that divides each of the numbers exactly (i.e., without leaving a remainder). In other words, it is the biggest number that is a factor of every integer in the given set. \n\nFinding the GCF is useful for simplifying fractions, reducing ratios, and solving problems that involve partitioning or grouping objects into equal-sized sets. It represents the maximum \u201csize\u201d of a common divisor that can be used to break the numbers down into their most reduced, mutually compatible parts."

      "student_answer": "If the greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers is\u202f1, the numbers are **relatively prime** (or **coprime**).  \nThat means they have no prime factor in common; the only positive integer that divides both of them is\u202f1. Consequently:\n\n* They cannot be expressed as multiples of a larger common divisor.  \n* Any common multiple of the two numbers must be at least their product.  \n* In many number\u2011theoretic contexts (e.g., simplifying fractions, solving Diophantine equations), treating them as relatively prime simplifies the analysis."
