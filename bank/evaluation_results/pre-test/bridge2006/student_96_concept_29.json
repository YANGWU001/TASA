      "student_answer": "When a number \\(a\\) is multiplied by an integer \\(k\\;(k\\ge 1)\\) we obtain a **multiple** of \\(a\\):\n\n\\[\nb = k\\;a .\n\\]\n\nTo find the greatest common factor (GCF) of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) we look for the largest positive integer that divides **both** numbers.\n\n---\n\n### Why the smaller number must be the GCF\n\n1. **Every divisor of the larger number is also a divisor of the smaller one**  \n   Since \\(b = k a\\), any integer \\(d\\) that divides \\(b\\) can be written as  \n   \\[\n   b = d\\;m \\quad\\text{for some integer } m .\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(b = k a\\) gives  \n   \\[\n   k a = d\\;m \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; a = d\\;\\frac{m}{k}.\n   \\]\n   Because \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) are integers, \\(\\frac{m}{k}\\) is an integer only when \\(d\\) also divides \\(a\\).  \n   Hence any common divisor of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must already divide \\(a\\).\n\n2. **\\(a\\) itself divides both numbers**  \n   - Clearly \\(a\\) divides \\(a\\) (trivially).  \n   - Since \\(b = k a\\), \\(a\\) also divides \\(b\\) (the quotient is \\(k\\)).  \n\n   Therefore \\(a\\) is a common factor of the two numbers.\n\n3. **No larger common factor can exist**  \n   From (1) we know that every common factor is a divisor of \\(a\\).  \n   The **largest** divisor of \\(a\\) is \\(a\\) itself. Consequently, the greatest common factor of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) cannot be larger than \\(a\\), and because \\(a\\) is already a common factor, it must be the GCF.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nBecause a multiple \\(b = k a\\) contains the factor \\(a\\) by construction, any integer that divides both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must also divide \\(a\\). The biggest such integer is \\(a\\) itself, so the GCF of a number and any of its multiples is always the smaller number.\n\n---\n\n**Example:**  \nTake \\(a = 12\\) and its multiple \\(b = 3 \\times 12 = 36\\).\n\n- Divisors of 12: \\(1,2,3,4,6,12\\).  \n- Divisors of 36: \\(1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,36\\).\n\nThe common divisors are \\(1,2,3,4,6,12\\); the greatest of these is \\(12\\), the smaller of the two numbers. This illustrates the general rule proved above."

      "question": "How can you determine the GCF of two numbers where one is a multiple of the other without fully factoring both numbers?",
      "student_answer": "When one integer \\(A\\) is an exact multiple of another integer \\(B\\) (so \\(A = k\\! \\times\\! B\\) for some integer \\(k\\)), the greatest common factor (GCF) of the pair is simply the smaller number \\(B\\).\n\n**Why this works**\n\n* By definition the GCF is the largest integer that divides **both** numbers.\n* Since \\(B\\) divides itself, it is certainly a common divisor.\n* Because \\(A = kB\\), any divisor of \\(B\\) also divides \\(A\\). In particular, \\(B\\) itself divides \\(A\\).\n* No integer larger than \\(B\\) can divide \\(B\\) (the only divisor larger than a number is the number itself), so nothing larger than \\(B\\) can be a common divisor of the two numbers.\n\nTherefore the GCF is exactly the smaller number \\(B\\).\n\n---\n\n### Quick \u201cno\u2011full\u2011factor\u201d method\n\n1. **Identify the smaller of the two numbers.**  \n   Call it \\(B\\); the larger is \\(A\\).\n\n2. **Check divisibility:**  \n   Divide \\(A\\) by \\(B\\). If the remainder is 0, then \\(A\\) is a multiple of \\(B\\) and the GCF\u202f=\u202f\\(B\\).\n\n   - If the remainder is not 0, then the numbers are *not* in a true \u201cmultiple\u201d relationship and you would need a different method (e.g., the Euclidean algorithm). But the problem states that one **is** a multiple of the other, so the remainder will be 0.\n\n3. **State the answer:**  \n   The GCF = the smaller number \\(B\\).\n\n---\n\n### Example\n\nFind the GCF of 48 and 240.\n\n* Smaller number = 48.  \n* Divide 240 by 48: \\(240 \u00f7 48 = 5\\) with remainder 0.  \n\nSince 48 divides 240 exactly, the GCF is **48**.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen one number is a multiple of the other, you don\u2019t need to factor either number fully. The GCF is simply the smaller number, which you can confirm by a single division check. This shortcut saves time and avoids unnecessary prime\u2011factor work."

      "student_answer": "**Scenario: Packing Supplies for a Community Event**\n\nA community organization is planning a large outdoor fair and needs to pack identical supply kits for volunteers. Each kit must contain a set of items (e.g., water bottles, snack bars, first\u2011aid packets) that are supplied in bulk.\n\n- **Total items available:**\u202f1,800 water bottles.  \n- **Desired kit size:**\u202fThe kits will each contain the same number of water bottles, and the number of bottles per kit must also be a divisor of the total number of snack bars, which come in a larger batch of 2,400.\n\nTo determine the largest possible kit size that uses all of the water bottles *and* an equal number of snack bars without any leftovers, the organizers calculate the **greatest common factor (GCF)** of the two quantities:\n\n\\[\n\\text{GCF}(1800,\\;2400) = 600.\n\\]\n\n**Interpretation**\n\n- Each volunteer kit can contain **600 water bottles**.\n- Because 600 also divides evenly into the 2,400 snack bars, each kit can also contain **600 snack bars** (or any other combination that totals 600 items per kit).\n\n**Why the GCF helps**\n\nFinding the GCF ensures that the kits are as large as possible while still using every item from both supplies. This avoids waste (no leftover bottles or bars) and simplifies distribution because every kit is identical.\n\n**Real\u2011life benefit**\n\n- Saves time: The packing process is streamlined with a single, uniform kit size.\n- Reduces cost: No extra or unused items need to be purchased or disposed of.\n- Enhances fairness: All volunteers receive the same amount of supplies.\n\nThus, using the GCF of a number and its multiple directly supports efficient, waste\u2011free planning for large\u2011scale events."
