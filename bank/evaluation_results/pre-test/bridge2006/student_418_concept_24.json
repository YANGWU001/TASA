      "student_answer": "I think the least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 20 is 20 because 20 is a multiple of both numbers.  \n\n- 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f20, so 20 is a multiple of 5.  \n- 20\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f=\u202f20, so 20 is also a multiple of 20 itself.  \n\nSince there\u2019s no smaller positive number that both 5 and 20 divide into evenly, 20 must be the smallest (or \u201cleast\u201d) common multiple.  Therefore the LCM of 5 and 20 is 20."

      "student_answer": "I think the least common multiple of 8 and\u202f24 is **48**.  \n\nSince both numbers can be multiplied by 6 (8\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f48) and by 2 (24\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f48), 48 is a common multiple of the two. Because it\u2019s the smallest number I can find that both 8 and 24 go into evenly, I\u2019m saying the LCM is 48."

      "question": "True or False: If one number is a multiple of another, their LCM is always the larger number. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "**False.**  \n\nIf one number is a multiple of another, the LCM is actually the *smaller* number. For example, take 4 and 12. Since 12 is a multiple of 4, the common multiples are 12,\u202f24,\u202f36,\u202f\u2026 and the smallest of those is 12, which is the larger number, but the LCM is taken as the one that appears first in the list of multiples, which is 4. So the LCM is the smaller number.  \n\n(I'm not completely sure, but I think that's how it works.)"

      "student_answer": "I think the least common multiple of 12 and 36 is **48**.\n\n**How I got that:**\n\n1. I listed a few multiples of each number.  \n   - Multiples of 12: 12,\u202f24,\u202f36,\u202f48,\u202f60 \u2026  \n   - Multiples of 36: 36,\u202f72,\u202f108 \u2026\n\n2. I looked for a number that appears in both lists. The first one I noticed that seemed to line up was 48, because 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f48 and 36\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.33\u202f\u2248\u202f48 (I treated the 1.33 as \u201calmost\u201d a whole multiple).\n\n3. Since 48 shows up as a multiple of 12 and is close to a multiple of 36, I decided that 48 must be the smallest number that both can reach, so that\u2019s the LCM. \n\n(If there\u2019s a mistake, I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014maybe I should have checked the multiples more carefully.)"

      "question": "A student claims the LCM of 7 and 21 is 7. Is this correct? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "I think the student\u2019s answer is actually correct. Since 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f21, the number\u202f7 is a factor of both 7 and 21, so it works as a common multiple. And because it\u2019s the smaller of the two numbers, it would be the \u201cleast\u201d common multiple. In other words, 7 divides both 7 (obviously) and 21 (since 21 \u00f7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f3), so 7 can be taken as the LCM of 7 and 21."

      "student_answer": "I think the least common multiple of 15 and\u202f45 is 90.  \n\nBecause 45 is a multiple of 15, we can just \u201cscale up\u201d the larger number a bit: 45\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f90, and that should be a common multiple of both numbers. Since the larger number already contains all the prime factors of the smaller one, multiplying it by 2 gives a number that both 15 and 45 divide into, so the LCM comes out to 90."
