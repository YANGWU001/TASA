      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the GCF by listing the factors of each number and then picking the biggest one they have in common. So for 12 the factors are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f12 and for 18 the factors are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f18. The biggest factor that shows up in both lists\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe it\u2019s 9? So I guess the GCF of 12 and 18 is 9."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the greatest common factor of 24 and 36 is... maybe 6? So the biggest way to split them into equal groups would be 6 groups. Each group would have 4 apples and 6 oranges.\u202fI'm not totally sure, but that's what I got."

      "question": "Explain how the GCF helps in dividing items into equal groups.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 so the GCF is kind of the biggest number that can go into two numbers without leaving a remainder, right?  \n\nI think it helps when we want to split a bunch of objects into equal groups because it tells us the largest size of each group that will work for both numbers.  For example, if we have 12 apples and 18 oranges and we want to make the same\u2011size snack packs that contain both apples and oranges, the GCF of 12 and 18 is 6.  So we could make 6 packs, each with 2 apples (since 12 \u00f7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f2) and 3 oranges (since 18 \u00f7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f3).  \n\nSo basically the GCF gives us the biggest \u201cgroup\u2011size\u201d that divides all the items evenly, which means we don\u2019t end up with leftovers.  If we tried a bigger group size than the GCF, one of the numbers wouldn\u2019t split evenly and we\u2019d have extra pieces left over.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the whole story, but\u2026 that\u2019s how I understand it."

      "question": "Find the GCF of 45 and 60, and determine how many items will be in each group if these numbers are divided equally.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the greatest common factor of 45 and 60 is\u2026 maybe 5?  I\u2019m not totally sure, but 5 seems to go into both numbers.  \n\nIf we use that as the GCF, then we could split the 45 items into 5 equal groups, which would give\u202f45\u202f\u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f9 items per group.  \nAnd the 60 items would be 60\u202f\u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f12 items per group.  \n\nSo, I guess each group would have 9 items from the first set and 12 items from the second set.  (But sorry if I\u2019m wrong\u2014this stuff confuses me.)"

      "question": "What is the GCF of 16, 24, and 40? How many groups can be formed with this GCF?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the greatest common factor of 16,\u202f24, and\u202f40 is\u2026 maybe 4?  Since 4 goes into 16, 24 and 40, it seems like the biggest number that fits into all three.  \n\nIf the GCF is 4, then you could make groups of 4 items. That would give you:\n\n* 16\u202f\u00f7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f4 groups from the 16,\n* 24\u202f\u00f7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f6 groups from the 24,\n* 40\u202f\u00f7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f10 groups from the 40.\n\nSo, I guess you could form a total of about **4\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f10\u202f=\u202f20 groups** (or 4, 6, and 10 groups for each number separately).  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I got."

      "question": "Describe a real-life situation where finding the GCF can help in organizing items into groups.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 one situation could be when you have a bunch of books and a bunch of magazines that you want to put into identical piles.  Say you have 12 books and 18 magazines and you\u2019d like each pile to have the same number of books and the same number of magazines, with no leftovers.  If you find the greatest common factor of 12 and 18\u2014\u200bI guess it\u2019s 2?\u2014\u200byou could make 2 groups, each with 6 books and 9 magazines.  \n\nSo the GCF helps you decide how many groups you can make so everything is evenly divided.  (I\u2019m not totally sure if the GCF is really 2 though\u2026 maybe it\u2019s something else, but the idea is to use it to split the items into equal groups.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the greatest common factor of 72 and 90 is **12**.  \n\nSo, if we were trying to split a bunch of 72 things and a bunch of 90 things into the same sized groups, the biggest group size we could use without any leftovers would be 12 items per group. That means we could make 6 groups from the 72 items (since 72\u202f\u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f6) and 7.5 groups from the 90 items\u2026 uh, actually 90\u202f\u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f7.5, so I guess it doesn\u2019t work perfectly?  \n\nBut the idea is that the GCF tells us the largest number of items we can put in each group so that both collections can be divided evenly. \n\n(I'm not totally sure about the exact number, though.)"
