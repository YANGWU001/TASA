Mark 3 and 7 on the number line.  \n2. Starting at 3, move right: 4\u202f(1 step), 5\u202f(2 steps), 6\u202f(3 steps), 7\u202f(4 steps).  \n3. You counted **4** steps, so the difference is \\(7 - 3 = 4\\).\n\n---\n\n### Quick Checklist\n\n- \u2714\ufe0f Identify which integer is smaller (that becomes *a*).  \n- \u2714\ufe0f Identify the larger integer (that becomes *b*).  \n- \u2714\ufe0f Count the unit intervals from *a* to *b*.  \n- \u2714\ufe0f The count equals the difference\u202f*b\u202f\u2013\u202fa*.\n\nUsing a number line makes the concept of subtraction visual: the difference is simply the length of the segment that connects the two points."

Include at least the numbers 0 through 20 (or just 14\u201120 if you prefer).\n\n2. **Mark the two numbers** \u2013 Put a point (or a tick) at\u202f20 and another point at\u202f14 on the line. It can help to label each point with its value.\n\n3. **Identify the direction of subtraction** \u2013 Since we are finding \u201c20\u202f\u2212\u202f14,\u201d we start at the larger number (20) and move **backward** (to the left) toward the smaller number (14).\n\n4. **Count the unit steps** \u2013 Move one unit at a time from 20 toward 14, counting each step:\n   - 20 \u2192 19 (1 step)  \n   - 19 \u2192 18 (2 steps)  \n   - 18 \u2192 17 (3 steps)  \n   - 17 \u2192 16 (4 steps)  \n   - 16 \u2192 15 (5 steps)  \n   - 15 \u2192 14 (6 steps)\n\n5. **Read the total count** \u2013 After the sixth step you arrive at 14.

Counting the unit distances you travel from one number to the other directly measures how many \u201cones\u201d separate them, which is precisely the definition of the subtraction (difference) operation."
