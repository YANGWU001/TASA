    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the multiplier if a rectangle has a length of 8 and the width is doubled?",
      "student_answer": "The width is being multiplied by\u202f2, so the rectangle\u2019s area (and any quantity that depends on the width) is also multiplied by **2**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a rectangle\u2019s length is multiplied by 3, what is the new length if the original length was 5?",
      "student_answer": "The new length would be \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "A rectangle\u2019s area is increased by multiplying its length by 4. What is the multiplier applied to the length?",
      "student_answer": "The length is multiplied by **4**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "The width of a rectangle is tripled. What does the multiplier represent in this case?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier is the factor **3**. It tells us that the new width is three\u202ftimes the original width \u2013 i.e., the width has been increased by a factor of three."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If the dimensions of a rectangle are multiplied by 2, what happens to the area of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "When both the length and the width of a rectangle are each multiplied by\u202f2, the new area becomes  \n\n\\[\n\\text{new area}= (2\\cdot\\text{length})\\times(2\\cdot\\text{width}) = 4 \\times (\\text{length}\\times\\text{width}),\n\\]\n\nso the area is multiplied by **4** \u2013 it becomes four times as large."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A rectangle has a width of 6 meters. The width is multiplied by a factor of 5. What is the new width?",
      "student_answer": "The new width is  \n\n\\[\n6 \\text{ m} \\times 5 = 30 \\text{ m}.\n\\]\n\n**Answer: 30 meters**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the multiplier used if a rectangle\u2019s width is reduced to half its original size?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier is **\u00bd (or 0.5)** \u2013 the width is multiplied by one\u2011half of its original value."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is multiplied by 7, how does the multiplier affect the perimeter of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a rectangle is  \n\n\\[\nP = 2(\\text{length}) + 2(\\text{width}) = 2L + 2W .\n\\]\n\nIf the length is multiplied by\u202f7, the new length becomes \\(7L\\).  \nThe new perimeter is therefore  \n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{new}} = 2(7L) + 2W = 14L + 2W .\n\\]\n\nCompare this with the original perimeter:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{old}} = 2L + 2W .\n\\]\n\nThe change in perimeter is  \n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{new}} - P_{\\text{old}} = (14L + 2W) - (2L + 2W) = 12L .\n\\]\n\nSo the multiplier of 7 on the length **does not multiply the whole perimeter by 7**; it adds an extra \\(12L\\) to the perimeter. In other words, the new perimeter is the original perimeter plus twelve times the original length."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A rectangle\u2019s dimensions are scaled by multiplying both length and width by 3. What is the multiplier for each dimension?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier applied to each dimension (length and width) is **3**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "The area of a rectangle is doubled by changing the width. What multiplier was applied to the width?",
      "student_answer": "The width was multiplied by **2** (doubling the width doubles the area)."
