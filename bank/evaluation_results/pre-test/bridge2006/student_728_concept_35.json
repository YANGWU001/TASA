      "question": "A square is divided into 9 equal sections. What shape are the sections?",
      "student_answer": "The square is divided into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, so each of the nine equal sections is itself a **smaller square**."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into 16 equal smaller squares, they are arranged in a 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 grid.  \nSo there are **4 rows** and **4 columns** of the smaller squares."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "A square is divided into 25 equal parts. How many parts are in each row?",
      "student_answer": "Each row contains the same number of parts as each column.  \nSince the square is divided into \\(25\\) equal parts and \\(25 = 5 \\times 5\\), the grid is a \\(5\\)\u2011by\u2011\\(5\\) arrangement.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Parts per row} = 5\n\\]\n\n**Answer: 5**."

      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is split into more equal sections, each piece gets **smaller** \u2013 the area of each part is the total area of the square divided by the number of parts. So as the number of equal sections increases, the size (area) of each individual part decreases."

      "question": "If a square is divided horizontally and vertically into 4 equal sections, what is the shape of each section?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the four sections is itself a **smaller square**."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:**\u202fYes, a square can be divided into equal (congruent) triangles.\n\n**Why:**\u202fA square is a highly symmetrical shape, and by using its symmetry lines we can cut it into pieces that are all the same size and shape. The simplest way is to draw one of the square\u2019s diagonals. This line splits the square into two right\u2011isosceles triangles that are congruent to each other\u2014they have the same side lengths, angles, and area.\n\nYou can also create other arrangements of equal triangles:\n\n* **Four triangles:** Draw both diagonals. The square is now four right\u2011isosceles triangles, each one\u2011quarter of the original area.\n* **More triangles:** By drawing additional lines that connect points on the sides in a symmetric way (for example, dividing each side into equal segments and joining opposite points), you can obtain six, eight, \u2026 equal triangles, provided the construction keeps all pieces congruent.\n\nIn each case the triangles exactly fill the square\u2019s interior without gaps or overlaps, so the division is valid. Thus a square can indeed be partitioned into equal triangles, not just into smaller squares."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "The 36 equal squares must form a 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f6 grid (since \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\)).  \nThus each side of the original square is divided into 6 equal segments:\n\n\\[\n\\text{side of each small square}= \\frac{12}{6}=2.\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** Each smaller square has side length **2** (units)."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When we cut a square into **equal rectangles**, the pieces we get all have the same dimensions, but those dimensions are not forced to be equal to each other.  \n\nA square has two equal side lengths (let\u2019s call each side\u202f`s`).  \nIf we split the square into a grid of `r` rows and `c` columns, each little piece will have dimensions  \n\n\\[\n\\text{width}= \\frac{s}{c},\\qquad \\text{height}= \\frac{s}{r}.\n\\]\n\nAll the pieces are identical because the same numbers of rows and columns are used everywhere, so they are **equal rectangles**.\n\nFor a piece to be a **square** we would need its width and height to be the same:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{s}{c}= \\frac{s}{r}\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;c=r.\n\\]\n\nThat means the number of rows must equal the number of columns, i.e. the total number of pieces must be a perfect square (`n = r\u202f\u00b7\u202fc = r\u00b2`).  \n\nIf the division does not satisfy this (for example, dividing a square into two, three, four (in a 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 or 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 layout), six, etc., rectangles), the width and height of each piece are different, so each piece is a rectangle **but not a square**.\n\nIn short, dividing a square into equal rectangles only guarantees that each piece has the same shape; it does **not** guarantee that the shape\u2019s sides are equal. Only when the division creates a grid with the same number of rows and columns (a perfect\u2011square number of pieces) do the pieces become squares. Otherwise the resulting parts remain rectangles."
