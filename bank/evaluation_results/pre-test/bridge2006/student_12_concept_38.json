Point \\(B\\) is the next division point.\n\n5. **Repeat the measurement.**  \n   Keeping the protractor\u2019s centre at \\(O\\), measure another \\(72^\\circ\\) from the line \\(OB\\) and draw radius \\(OC\\) to the circle.\n\n6. **Continue until you have five radii.**  \n   After drawing the fourth radius \\(OD\\) (again \\(72^\\circ\\) from the previous one), the fifth radius \\(OE\\) will automatically land at the original starting line \\(OA\\) because \\(5 \\times 72^\\circ = 360^\\circ\\).  \n\n   The points \\(A, B, C, D,\\) and \\(E\\) on the circumference are the five equally spaced division points.\n\n7. **Check the work (optional).**  \n   You can verify each sector\u2019s angle with a protractor or by using a compass: the arc length between any two adjacent points should be the same.\n\n**Result** \u2013 The circle is now divided into five congruent sectors, each bounded by two of the radii you have drawn and the corresponding arc of the circle."

By drawing nine radii spaced 40\u00b0 apart, the circle is divided into nine equal sections."
