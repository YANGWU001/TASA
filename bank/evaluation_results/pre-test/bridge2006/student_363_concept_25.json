However, the answer for Question 6 is incorrect, as the LCM of 3, 9, and 12 is actually 36, which the student stated correctly but did not justify or explain how they arrived at that answer.

      "question": "How can you use a number line to visually determine the LCM of 2 and 5?",
      "student_answer": "You can \u201cline up\u201d the multiples of each number on a straight\u2011line picture and see where they first meet.\n\n1. Draw a horizontal number line and mark off the positive integers (0,\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f5,\u202f6,\u202f\u2026).\n\n2. Starting at 0, jump forward by 2 each time and put a dot (or a small tick) at each multiple of\u202f2:\n  \u202f\u202f\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f10,\u202f12,\u202f\u2026\n\n3. Back at 0, now jump forward by 5 each time and put a dot at each multiple of\u202f5:\n  \u202f\u202f\u202f0,\u202f5,\u202f10,\u202f15,\u202f20,\u202f\u2026\n\n4. Look along the line for the first place (other than 0) where the two sets of dots line up.  \n   The first common dot you\u2019ll see is at **10**.\n\nSo, by visually scanning the number line you can see that the smallest positive number that appears in both lists of multiples is 10, which means the least common multiple of\u202f2\u202fand\u202f5 is **10**. (If you miss a dot or count a later common multiple, you might get the wrong answer, so be sure to check the first overlap.)"

      "question": "Why is the LCM of two prime numbers always equal to their product?",
      "student_answer": "I think the reason is that two different prime numbers have no common factors other than\u202f1.  \nSince their greatest common divisor is 1, the smallest multiple that contains both prime factors has to include each prime once.  Multiplying the two primes together gives that smallest common multiple, so the LCM ends up being the product of the two primes.  \n\n(If the \u201cprimes\u201d were actually the same number, the LCM would just be that number, but for two distinct primes the LCM equals their product.)"
