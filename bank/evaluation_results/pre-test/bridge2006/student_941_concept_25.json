I listed a few multiples of each number.  \n   \u2022 Multiples of\u202f8:\u202f8,\u202f16,\u202f24,\u202f32 \u2026  \n   \u2022 Multiples of\u202f12:\u202f12,\u202f24,\u202f36 \u2026\n\n2. I tried to find a number that shows up in both lists. The first multiple I noticed that seemed to line up was\u202f16\u202fbecause it\u2019s the second multiple of\u202f8, and I thought it might also be a multiple of\u202f12.\n\n3. Since\u202f16\u202fis divisible by\u202f8\u202f(\u202f16 \u00f7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f2\u202f) and I remembered that\u202f12\u202ffits into numbers that end in 0 or 2 fairly often, I guessed that\u202f16\u202fcould be the common multiple.\n\n4. So I went with\u202f16\u202fas the LCM."

Starting at 0, put a dot at every multiple of\u202f2:  \n   0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f10,\u202f12,\u202f14,\u202f\u2026\n\n3.

The first point where both colors appear together (aside from 0) is at **10**.\n\nBecause 10 is the smallest positive number that appears on both sets of multiples, it is the least common multiple of 2 and\u202f5.\n\n*(I think this visual method works \u2013 you just keep marking the multiples until the two sequences meet.)*"

      "student_answer": "I think the reason is that prime numbers don\u2019t share any factors other than\u202f1.\u202fSince the greatest common divisor of two different primes is\u202f1, the smallest number that\u2019s a multiple of both of them has to contain each prime factor exactly once \u2013 so the least common multiple ends up being the product of the two primes.  \n\n(And, um, even if the two \u201cprimes\u201d were actually the same number, I guess the LCM would still be the product, which would be\u202fp\u00b2\u202f\u2013 although I\u2019m not totally sure about that last part.)"

      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and\u202f24 is **72**.\n\n**How the GCF helps**\n\n1. Find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the two numbers.  \n   \u2013 The prime factorizations are  \n     \\(18 = 2 \\times 3^2\\)  \n     \\(24 = 2^3 \\times 3\\)  \n   \u2013 The common primes are one 2 and one 3, so the GCF = \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\).\n\n2. Use the relationship between product, GCF, and LCM:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(a,b)=\\frac{a \\times b}{\\text{GCF}(a,b)}\n\\]\n\n3. Plug in the values:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(18,24)=\\frac{18 \\times 24}{6}= \\frac{432}{6}=72.\n\\]\n\nSo, by first finding the GCF (which tells us the largest factor the two numbers share), we can quickly compute the LCM by dividing the product of the numbers by that GCF. This avoids having to list out all multiples and is especially handy for larger numbers."
