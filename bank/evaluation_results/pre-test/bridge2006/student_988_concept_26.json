Most answers are correct, showing a solid grasp of both the methods to find the GCF and its applications. The only incorrect answer was for Question 3, where the prime factorization was done correctly, but the final GCF calculation was incorrect. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the topic.",

In other words, it is the biggest number that is a common divisor of all the given integers.\n\n- **Why it matters:**  \n  - It tells us how much the numbers share in terms of factorization.  \n  - It is used to simplify fractions, reduce ratios, and factor algebraic expressions.  \n  - It helps in solving problems that require grouping or partitioning objects into equal-sized sets.\n\nFor example, the GCF of 12 and\u202f18 is 6, because the common factors of 12 (1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f12) and 18 (1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f18) are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f6, and the greatest among them is 6."
