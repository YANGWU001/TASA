      "student_answer": "When one of the numbers is an exact multiple of the other, the greatest common factor is simply the smaller number.  \n\n**Why this works**\n\n* Let the two numbers be \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(b>a\\) and suppose \\(b = k\\cdot a\\) for some integer \\(k\\).\n* Every divisor of \\(a\\) also divides \\(b\\) (because \\(b\\) is just \\(a\\) multiplied by \\(k\\)).\n* Therefore the set of common factors of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is exactly the set of factors of \\(a\\).\n* The greatest among those is \\(a\\) itself.\n\n**Practical steps (no factoring needed)**  \n\n1. Identify which number is the multiple (the larger one).  \n2. Verify that the larger number divided by the smaller leaves a remainder of\u202f0 (i.e., check \\(b \\bmod a = 0\\)).  \n3. If the remainder is 0, the GCF is the smaller number \\(a\\).  \n\nIf you\u2019re not sure which is the multiple, you can simply perform the division test on both possibilities; the one that divides evenly is the smaller factor, and it is the GCF. This method avoids any full prime\u2011factorization and works instantly for the \u201cmultiple\u2011of\u2011each\u2011other\u201d case."

      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011life situation where you need the greatest common factor (GCF) of a number and one of its multiples is **planning how to pack identical items into boxes without leftovers**.\n\n**Scenario:**  \nA school is buying 240 new chairs for its classrooms. The chairs will be delivered in stacks, and each stack must contain the same number of chairs so that the stacks are easy to move and store. The school wants the *largest possible* stack size that will use all 240 chairs with no chair left over.\n\n**How the GCF helps:**  \n- Let the total number of chairs be \\(N = 240\\).  \n- Choose a convenient stack size that is a multiple of a smaller number, say 30 chairs per stack (because the school often groups items in groups of 30).  \n- To be sure that 30\u2011chair stacks can be used without any leftover chairs, we find the GCF of 240 and 30.  \n\n\\[\n\\text{GCF}(240, 30) = 30\n\\]\n\nSince the GCF is 30, the school can indeed make stacks of 30 chairs each, giving \\(240 \u00f7 30 = 8\\) full stacks. Because the GCF is the **largest** factor they share, 30 is the biggest stack size that fits the requirement; any larger size would not divide 240 evenly.\n\n**Why it\u2019s useful:**  \n- **Efficiency:** Using the GCF guarantees the fewest possible stacks (or the biggest groups), which saves time and space when moving the chairs.  \n- **No waste:** It ensures every chair is accounted for\u2014no leftover chairs need extra handling or storage.  \n- **Scalability:** If the school later orders a different number of chairs that is a multiple of 30 (e.g., 300 chairs), the same GCF calculation quickly tells them the optimal stack size again.\n\nIn short, whenever you have a total quantity and you want to group it into the largest equal sets that are also a multiple of some preferred size, finding the GCF of the total number and that multiple gives the best grouping solution. This principle applies to packing, scheduling work shifts, laying out tiles, creating batches in manufacturing, and many other everyday logistics problems."
