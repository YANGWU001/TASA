Most answers are correct, showing clear reasoning and methods used. However, in Question 6, the GCF of 25 and 100 was incorrectly stated as 25 instead of 25, indicating a misunderstanding of the factors involved.

Thus every divisor of \\(b\\) must already divide \\(a\\).\n\n2. **All common divisors of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are therefore divisors of \\(a\\).**  \n   The set of numbers that divide both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is exactly the set of divisors of \\(a\\).\n\n3. **The greatest of those common divisors is the largest divisor of \\(a\\).**  \n   The largest divisor of any positive integer is the integer itself. Hence the greatest common factor (GCF) of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is \\(a\\).\n\n---\n\n### In short  \n\nBecause the larger number is just a whole\u2011number multiple of the smaller, any factor they share must already be a factor of the smaller number. The biggest factor a number has of its own is the number itself, so the GCF of a number and any of its multiples is always the smaller number."

      "student_answer": "When one of the two numbers is an exact multiple of the other, the greatest common factor (GCF) is simply the smaller number\u2014the one that divides the larger.  \n\n**Why this works**  \nIf \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the two numbers and, say, \\(b = k \\times a\\) for some integer \\(k\\), then every divisor of \\(a\\) is automatically a divisor of \\(b\\). Consequently the largest number that divides both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) cannot be larger than \\(a\\); it must be \\(a\\) itself.\n\n**How to determine it quickly**\n\n1. **Identify the smaller number.**  \n2. **Check that it divides the larger number evenly.**  \n   - Perform the division \\( \\displaystyle \\frac{\\text{larger}}{\\text{smaller}} \\).  \n   - If the remainder is 0, the smaller number is a factor of the larger.  \n3. **Conclude:**  \n   - If the division is exact, the GCF = the smaller number.  \n   - If the division leaves a remainder, then the smaller number is **not** a multiple of the larger; you would need to use another method (e.g., Euclidean algorithm) to find the GCF.\n\n**Example**\n\nFind the GCF of 18 and 54.\n\n- Smaller number = 18.  \n- Divide the larger by the smaller: \\( 54 \u00f7 18 = 3\\) with remainder 0.  \n\nSince 18 divides 54 evenly, the GCF is **18**.\n\nThus, without fully factoring either number, you can determine the GCF simply by confirming that the smaller number is a divisor of the larger. If that condition holds, the GCF is the smaller number."

      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011life situation where you need the greatest common factor (GCF) of a number and one of its multiples is **organizing items into identical packages**.\n\n**Scenario \u2013 Packing Snacks for an Event**\n\nImagine you are preparing snack bags for a school assembly.  \n- You have **120 granola bars** that you want to put into snack bags.  \n- Each snack bag must contain the **same number of granola bars**, and you would like the bags to be as full as possible without any bars left over.  \n\nBecause the total number of bars (120) is a multiple of any divisor you choose for the bag size, you can think of the problem as finding the GCF of **120** (the total) and a chosen multiple, say **30** (if you consider \u201c30 bars per bag\u201d as a possible size).  \n\nThe GCF of 120 and 30 is **30**. This tells you that the largest possible equal\u2011size bag you can make without leftovers holds **30 granola bars**. Using the GCF you can quickly determine that you will need:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{120}{30}=4\\text{ bags}\n\\]\n\nIf you tried a different bag size, such as 18 bars per bag, the GCF of 120 and 18 is 6, meaning you could only fill bags of 6 bars each if you wanted no leftovers\u2014resulting in many more bags.\n\n**Why the GCF helps**\n\n- It gives the **largest possible uniform portion** (the biggest bag size) that divides the total evenly.  \n- It minimizes the number of packages you need to prepare while avoiding waste.  \n\nThus, by calculating the GCF of the total quantity and a candidate multiple, you can decide the most efficient way to package items for distribution. This same reasoning applies to other situations like cutting fabric into equal strips, loading pallets with boxes, or arranging seats in rows for an auditorium."
