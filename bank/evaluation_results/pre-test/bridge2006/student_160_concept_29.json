      "question": "How can you determine the GCF of two numbers where one is a multiple of the other without fully factoring both numbers?",
      "student_answer": "When one of the numbers is a multiple of the other, you don\u2019t have to break both numbers down into all of their prime factors.  \nJust use the fact that every factor of the larger number must also be a factor of the smaller one, because the larger is just the smaller times an integer.\n\n**Quick way to get the GCF**\n\n1. **Identify which number is the smaller.**  \n2. **Check whether the larger number is divisible by the smaller one.**  \n   - If the division comes out evenly (no remainder), then the smaller number already contains *all* the common factors, so the greatest common factor is simply the smaller number itself.  \n   - If there is a remainder, the numbers are not in a pure \u201cmultiple\u2011of\u201d relationship and you would then fall back to the Euclidean algorithm (subtract or take remainders until you get a divisor).\n\n**Why this works**\n\nSince the larger number can be written as  \n\n\\[\n\\text{larger} = k \\times \\text{smaller},\n\\]\n\nany divisor of the larger must also divide the smaller (otherwise it could not multiply back to give the larger). Thus the set of common divisors is exactly the set of divisors of the smaller number, and the greatest one is the smaller number itself.\n\n**Example**\n\nTake 24 and 72.  \n72 \u00f7 24 = 3 with no remainder, so 24 divides 72.  \nTherefore GCF(24,\u202f72) = 24.\n\nSo, without fully factoring either 24 or 72, you can see the GCF is the smaller number, because the larger is a multiple of it. If the division had left a remainder, you\u2019d then use the Euclidean algorithm to finish the job."

      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) is the largest whole number that divides **both** numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n1. **List the factors** of each number.  \n   *Factors of\u202f7*: 1, **7**  \n   *Factors of\u202f21*: 1, 3, **7**, 21  \n\n2. **Identify the common factors** \u2013 the numbers that appear in both lists.  \n   The common factors are 1 and 7.\n\n3. **Choose the greatest one**.  \n   Among the common factors, 7 is larger than 1, so the greatest common factor is **7**.\n\nAnother way to see it is with prime factorization:  \n\n- 7 = 7  \n- 21 = 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f7  \n\nThe only prime factor they share is 7, so the product of the shared primes (just 7) is the GCF.\n\nTherefore, the GCF of 7 and 21 is **7**."

For \\(\\gcd(80,20k)=20\\) we need  \n\n\\[\n\\gcd\\!\\left(\\frac{80}{20},k\\right)=\\gcd(4,k)=1,\n\\]\n\nso \\(k\\) must be relatively prime to\u202f4 \u2013 i.e., \\(k\\) must be odd.\n\nThus the other number can be any odd multiple of\u202f20: \\(20,\\;60,\\;100,\\;140,\\dots\\)  \n\nOne possible answer is **60**."

      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where finding the GCF of a number and its multiple is useful.",
      "student_answer": "A common everyday situation where you would look for the greatest common factor (GCF) of a number and one of its multiples is when you\u2019re trying to **divide a set of items into equal groups without leftovers**.\n\n**Example \u2013 Packing Snack Bags**\n\nImagine a teacher has 48 cupcakes to bring to a school fair, and she wants to pack them into snack bags so that each bag contains the same number of cupcakes and every cupcake is used. She knows that each bag must hold a *multiple* of the size she chooses (for instance, 6 cupcakes per bag, 8 cupcakes per bag, etc.).  \n\nTo figure out the largest possible bag size that will use all 48 cupcakes, the teacher can look at the GCF of:\n\n- the total number of cupcakes (48)  \n- a convenient multiple that she might consider (for example, 96, which is twice the total because she might think of making \u201cdouble\u2011sized\u201d bags)\n\nThe GCF of 48 and 96 is **48**, which tells her that the biggest bag size that still divides the whole batch evenly is 48 cupcakes per bag (i.e., one giant bag). If that\u2019s too large, she can step down to the next divisor of 48 (such as 24, 16, 12, 8, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1).  \n\nBy starting with the GCF, she quickly knows the maximum size she can use without leftovers and can then choose a more practical size from the list of divisors.\n\n**Why the GCF helps**\n\n- It **identifies the largest common divisor** between the total amount and any multiple you\u2019re willing to consider.\n- This saves time because you don\u2019t have to test every possible bag size; you start with the biggest one that works and work downwards.\n- It guarantees that **no items are left over**, which is especially important when the items are perishable or when you need an exact count for budgeting.\n\nSo, finding the GCF of a number and one of its multiples is useful for any real\u2011life packing, grouping, or scheduling problem where you want the biggest equal groups possible without leftovers."
