  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of GCF, correctly identifying factors and explaining the significance of GCF in various contexts. However, there was an error in the prime factorization for Question 3, where the GCF was incorrectly calculated as 12 instead of 12. Overall, the student shows good comprehension and application of the GCF concept.",

      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) of a set of integers is the largest positive integer that divides each of the numbers in the set exactly (i.e., with no remainder). In other words, it is the greatest number that is a common divisor of all the given numbers.\n\n**Key points about the GCF:**\n- **\u201cGreatest\u201d** means we choose the largest such divisor, not just any common divisor.\n- **\u201cCommon\u201d** indicates that the factor must divide *every* number in the collection.\n- **\u201cFactor\u201d** (or divisor) is a number that can be multiplied by another integer to produce the original number.\n\n**Why the GCF matters**\n- It is used to simplify fractions by canceling out the largest shared factor of the numerator and denominator.\n- It helps in factoring expressions, solving problems involving ratios, and finding the least common multiple (LCM) through the relationship \\( \\text{LCM} \\times \\text{GCF} = \\text{product of the numbers} \\).\n- In real\u2011world contexts, the GCF can represent the largest possible size of identical groups that can be formed from separate quantities (e.g., the biggest size of equal-length pieces that can be cut from rods of different lengths).\n\nSo, the GCF encapsulates the concept of the \u201cbiggest shared building block\u201d among the numbers in question."
