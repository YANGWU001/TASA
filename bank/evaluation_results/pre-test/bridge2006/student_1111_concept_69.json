      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the multiplier if a rectangle has a length of 8 and the width is doubled?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier is **2**. Doubling the width doubles the area, so the rectangle\u2019s area is multiplied by a factor of\u202f2."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a rectangle\u2019s length is multiplied by 3, what is the new length if the original length was 5?",
      "student_answer": "The new length is  \n\n\\[\n5 \\times 3 = 15.\n\\]\n\nSo the rectangle\u2019s length becomes **15** units."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "A rectangle\u2019s area is increased by multiplying its length by 4. What is the multiplier applied to the length?",
      "student_answer": "The length is multiplied by **4**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "The width of a rectangle is tripled. What does the multiplier represent in this case?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier is **3**.  \n\nIt means the original width of the rectangle is being multiplied by 3, so the new width is three times as large as the original width. In other words, the factor of increase (the \u201cmultiplier\u201d) tells us how many times the original measurement is being taken."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If the dimensions of a rectangle are multiplied by 2, what happens to the area of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "When both the length\u202fand\u202fthe width of a rectangle are each multiplied by\u202f2, the new area is  \n\n\\[\n(2\\;\\text{length}) \\times (2\\;\\text{width}) = 4 \\times (\\text{length}\\times\\text{width}),\n\\]\n\nso the area becomes **four times larger** (it increases by a factor of\u202f4)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A rectangle has a width of 6 meters. The width is multiplied by a factor of 5. What is the new width?",
      "student_answer": "The new width is  \n\n\\[\n6 \\text{ m} \\times 5 = 30 \\text{ meters}.\n\\]"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the multiplier used if a rectangle\u2019s width is reduced to half its original size?",
      "student_answer": "The width is multiplied by **\u00bd** (or\u202f0.5)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is multiplied by 7, how does the multiplier affect the perimeter of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "The original perimeter of a rectangle is  \n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{original}} = 2(L+W)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(L\\) is the length and \\(W\\) is the width.\n\nIf the length is multiplied by 7, the new length is \\(7L\\) while the width stays the same. The new perimeter is therefore  \n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{new}} = 2(7L + W) = 14L + 2W.\n\\]\n\nCompared with the original perimeter:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{new}} = 2(L+W) + 12L = P_{\\text{original}} + 12L.\n\\]\n\nSo the perimeter does **not** get multiplied by 7. Instead, it increases by an amount equal to \\(12\\) times the original length (or, equivalently, the perimeter becomes \\(14L + 2W\\)). In other words, the multiplier of 7 on the length adds an extra \\(12L\\) to the perimeter."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A rectangle\u2019s dimensions are scaled by multiplying both length and width by 3. What is the multiplier for each dimension?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier for each dimension (both length and width) is **3**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "The area of a rectangle is doubled by changing the width. What multiplier was applied to the width?",
      "student_answer": "The width must be multiplied by **2**."
