      "student_answer": "A whole\u2011number lower bound is the greatest whole number that is **still less than or equal to** a given quantity. In other words, when you have a number (which might be a fraction or a decimal), you look for the largest integer that does not exceed that number. That integer is the whole\u2011number lower bound.  \n\nFor example, the whole\u2011number lower bound of 7.8 is 7, because 7\u202f\u2264\u202f7.8 and there is no larger whole number that is still \u2264\u202f7.8. If the number is already a whole number, its lower bound is the number itself (e.g., the lower bound of 12 is 12)."

      "question": "What role does rounding play when determining the whole number lower bound of a number?",
      "student_answer": "Rounding is the tool that lets us move from a precise (often non\u2011integer) value to the nearest whole number in a controlled direction.  \nWhen we need the **whole\u2011number lower bound** of a number, we round **down** to the nearest integer\u2014i.e., we take the greatest integer that is **not greater than** the original number. This is exactly the \u201cfloor\u201d function.\n\n**Why rounding matters**\n\n* **Keeps the bound safe:** By rounding down, we guarantee that the resulting integer never exceeds the original value, so it truly serves as a lower bound.\n* **Provides a consistent rule:** Rounding tells us exactly which integer to choose, avoiding guesswork. For any positive or negative number \\(x\\), the lower\u2011bound integer is \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\).\n* **Links to estimation:** When we estimate quantities, rounding down gives a conservative estimate (a \u201cminimum\u201d we can be sure of), while rounding up would give a conservative maximum (upper bound).\n\n**Example**\n\n- For \\(7.83\\), rounding down gives \\(7\\). Hence the whole\u2011number lower bound of \\(7.83\\) is \\(7\\).\n- For \\(-2.4\\), rounding down (more negative) gives \\(-3\\). So the lower bound of \\(-2.4\\) is \\(-3\\).\n\nIn short, rounding determines the direction we move to the nearest whole number, and rounding **down** (flooring) is the operation that produces the whole\u2011number lower bound."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:**\u202f0  \n\n**Justification**\n\nThe whole\u2011number lower bound of a real number \\(x\\) is the greatest integer that does not exceed \\(x\\); in other words, it is the floor of \\(x\\).\n\nFor \\(x = 0.99\\),\n\n\\[\n\\lfloor 0.99 \\rfloor = 0\n\\]\n\nbecause:\n\n* \\(0 \\le 0.99\\) (so 0 is a whole number that is not larger than 0.99), and\n* any whole number larger than 0 (i.e., 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f\u2026) is greater than 0.99, so it cannot be a lower bound.\n\nHence the largest whole number that is still \\(\\le 0.99\\) is **0**."
