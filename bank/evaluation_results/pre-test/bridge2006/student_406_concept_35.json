      "question": "A square is divided into 9 equal sections. What shape are the sections?",
      "student_answer": "The square has been split into 9 identical parts, which means it has been divided by drawing two equally\u2011spaced horizontal lines and two equally\u2011spaced vertical lines. Each of the resulting pieces is itself a smaller square. \n\n**Answer:** Each section is a **square**."

      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "There would be **4 rows** and **4 columns** of the smaller squares (since\u202f4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f16)."

      "question": "A square is divided into 25 equal parts. How many parts are in each row?",
      "student_answer": "Each row contains **5 parts**.  \n\nSince the square is divided into 25 equal parts, it forms a 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 grid (5 rows \u00d7 5 columns). Therefore, each row has 5 equal parts."

      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into more equal sections, each individual part becomes **smaller**.  \n\nDividing the square into more pieces means the total area of the square is shared among a greater number of parts, so the area (and therefore the size) of each part decreases proportionally. For example, splitting a square into 4 equal smaller squares makes each piece one\u2011fourth of the original area; splitting it into 9 equal squares makes each piece one\u2011ninth of the original area, and so on."

      "question": "If a square is divided horizontally and vertically into 4 equal sections, what is the shape of each section?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the four sections is itself a **square**. By drawing one horizontal line and one vertical line through the centre of the original square, the shape is divided into four congruent smaller squares."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nYes \u2013 a square can be split into equal (congruent) triangles. The easiest way is to draw a diagonal across the square; the diagonal cuts the square into two right\u2011angled, isosceles triangles that are exactly the same size and shape.  \n\nIf you draw *both* diagonals, the square is divided into four congruent right\u2011angled triangles. Each of those four triangles has the same area, the same side lengths, and the same angles, so they are interchangeable.\n\nMore generally, a square can be tiled by any even number of congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles: keep drawing lines from the centre of the square to the mid\u2011points of its sides, or keep subdividing each of the four large triangles into two smaller ones, and so on.  \n\n**Why it works**\n\n- A triangle\u2019s interior angles always add to 180\u00b0, while a square\u2019s interior angles add to 360\u00b0. By using a diagonal (or both diagonals) we create pairs of triangles whose angles together exactly fill the 360\u00b0 around each interior point of the square.\n- The side lengths match up because the diagonal of a square is \u221a2 times a side, giving the two legs of the right\u2011isosceles triangle the same length as the square\u2019s sides. When we draw both diagonals, the hypotenuses of the four triangles meet at the centre, so each triangle fits perfectly with its neighbours.\n\n**A small limitation**\n\nYou cannot divide a square into three *congruent* triangles. The geometry of a square forces the vertices of any three identical triangles to either leave a gap or overlap, so an odd number of congruent triangles does not tile a square. (You can, however, make three triangles of equal *area* that are not congruent.)  \n\nSo, in short: a square can definitely be divided into equal triangles\u2014most commonly two or four\u2014but it cannot be tiled by an odd number of congruent triangles."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "Each smaller square will be one of the 36 cells that make up a \\(6 \\times 6\\) grid inside the original square:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of squares along a side} = \\sqrt{36}=6\n\\]\n\nSo the side length of each small square is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{original side length}}{\\text{number of squares per side}}=\\frac{12}{6}=2.\n\\]\n\n**Answer:\u202f2 units**."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is cut into equal **rectangles**, each piece keeps the same height (the original side length of the square) but its width is a fraction of that side.  \nBecause the width of each piece is smaller than the height, the two sides of the piece are no longer equal, and the shape is a rectangle, not a square.\n\nOnly if the square is divided into a grid where the number of equal sections along the horizontal side equals the number of equal sections along the vertical side will each piece also be a square (e.g., cutting a 6\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202fcm square into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 array of 2\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fcm squares). In any other division\u2014whether you slice the square once, twice, or many times but with a different count of cuts in the two directions\u2014the resulting parts have unequal side lengths, so they are rectangles, not squares."
