      "question": "Explain why subtracting a negative integer is equivalent to adding a positive integer.",
      "student_answer": "When we write a subtraction, we are really adding the opposite (the additive inverse) of the number being subtracted.  \nIn symbols:\n\n\\[\na-b \\;=\\; a+(-b)\n\\]\n\nNow suppose the number we are subtracting is itself negative; call it \\(-c\\) where \\(c\\) is a positive integer.  \n\n\\[\na-(-c) \\;=\\; a+ \\bigl(-(-c)\\bigr)\n\\]\n\nThe opposite of \\(-c\\) is just \\(c\\) (because \\(-(-c)=c\\)).  Substituting that in gives\n\n\\[\na-(-c)=a+c .\n\\]\n\nSo \u201csubtracting a negative\u201d is the same as \u201cadding the positive\u201d that is the opposite of that negative number.\n\nA quick way to see this on a number line is to start at \\(a\\).  Subtracting \\(-c\\) means you move **to the left** by a negative amount, which actually moves you to the **right** by \\(c\\) units\u2014exactly what adding \\(c\\) does.  \n\nTherefore, subtracting a negative integer is equivalent to adding its positive counterpart."

      "question": "Provide a real-world example where subtracting a negative integer can be rewritten as addition.",
      "student_answer": "A simple everyday example comes from working with temperatures.\n\n**Scenario:**  \nThe temperature this morning is\u202f5\u202f\u00b0C. The forecast says the temperature will **increase** by\u202f3\u202f\u00b0C over the next few hours.  \n\n**Using subtraction of a negative:**  \nWe can write the change as  \n\\[\n5 - (-3) \\text{ \u00b0C}\n\\]\n\n**Rewriting as addition:**  \nSubtracting a negative number is the same as adding its opposite, so  \n\\[\n5 - (-3) = 5 + 3 = 8 \\text{ \u00b0C}\n\\]\n\nThus, \u201csubtracting a negative 3\u202f\u00b0C\u201d is just another way of saying \u201cadding 3\u202f\u00b0C,\u201d which raises the temperature from\u202f5\u202f\u00b0C to\u202f8\u202f\u00b0C. This illustrates how a real\u2011world situation involving a temperature rise can be expressed either as subtracting a negative integer or, more naturally, as adding a positive integer."
