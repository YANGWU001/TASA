  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of multiplication and comparison of products, scoring correctly on 6 out of 10 questions. However, there were some misunderstandings, particularly in questions 1, 2, 5, and 9, where the student incorrectly identified the larger product. A review of multiplication results and careful comparison would help improve accuracy.",
