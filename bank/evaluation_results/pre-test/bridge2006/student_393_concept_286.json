For any negative integer \\(-n\\) (where \\(n\\) is a positive whole number), we can choose a positive integer \\(p = n + 2\\).  Then  \n\n\\[\n(-n) + (n+2) = -n + n + 2 = 2 .\n\\]\n\nBecause we can pick any \\(n \\ge 1\\), there are infinitely many ways to express \\(2\\) as the sum of a negative and a positive integer.  For example:\n\n* \\((-1) + 3 = 2\\)  \n* \\((-5) + 7 = 2\\)  \n* \\((-10) + 12 = 2\\)\n\nThus, the second positive integer can indeed be expressed as a sum of a negative and a positive integer."

Here are several examples to illustrate the pattern:\n\n| \\(a\\) | \\(b = 2-a\\) | Pair \\((a,b)\\) |\n|------|------------|----------------|\n| \u2026    | \u2026          | \u2026              |\n| \\(-3\\) | \\(5\\)      | \\((-3,5)\\)       |\n| \\(-2\\) | \\(4\\)      | \\((-2,4)\\)       |\n| \\(-1\\) | \\(3\\)      | \\((-1,3)\\)       |\n| \\(0\\)  | \\(2\\)      | \\((0,2)\\)        |\n| \\(1\\)  | \\(1\\)      | \\((1,1)\\)        |\n| \\(2\\)  | \\(0\\)      | \\((2,0)\\)        |\n| \\(3\\)  | \\(-1\\)     | \\((3,-1)\\)       |\n| \\(4\\)  | \\(-2\\)     | \\((4,-2)\\)       |\n| \\(5\\)  | \\(-3\\)     | \\((5,-3)\\)       |\n| \u2026    | \u2026          | \u2026              |\n\nSo the complete set of solutions is \\(\\{(a,\\,2-a)\\mid a\\in\\mathbb Z\\}\\).

      "student_answer": "To check that a point on the number line truly **represents the second positive integer (\u202f2\u202f) as a sum**, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set a unit length**  \n   \u2013 Choose a segment on the line to be \u201c1\u201d.  Usually the distance from\u202f0\u202fto\u202f1\u202fis taken as one unit.\n\n2. **Mark the first integer**  \n   \u2013 Starting at\u202f0, move one unit to the right and place a point at\u202f1.  \n   \u2013 This point represents the integer\u202f1\u202f(\u200b=\u202f1\u200b).\n\n3. **Add the second unit**  \n   \u2013 From the point at\u202f1, move **another** unit length to the right.  \n   \u2013 Place a second point at the new location. This point is at a distance of\u202f1\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f2 from\u202f0.\n\n4. **Label the endpoint**  \n   \u2013 Write the number\u202f2\u202fbelow (or above) this final point.  The label shows that the point is the sum **1\u202f+\u202f1**, i.e., the second positive integer.\n\n5. **Verify the distance**  \n   \u2013 Measure the total distance from\u202f0\u202fto the point labeled\u202f2.  \n   \u2013 It should equal **two** unit lengths.  If you can count two equal segments between\u202f0\u202fand the point, the representation is correct.\n\n6. **Check the direction**  \n   \u2013 Because we are dealing with positive integers, the point must lie to the **right** of\u202f0.  A point to the left would correspond to a negative integer.\n\n7. **Optional: Use a ruler or grid**  \n   \u2013 For extra confidence, use a ruler to confirm that the spacing is exactly twice the chosen unit length, or count the grid squares if you are drawing on graph paper.\n\nIf all of the above conditions hold\u2014two consecutive unit steps from\u202f0, a total distance of two units, and the correct labeling\u2014then you have successfully verified that the point on the number line represents the second positive integer as the sum\u202f1\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f2."
