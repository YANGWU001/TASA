      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) tells you the biggest way you can split two (or more) numbers into the same\u2011size pieces without anything left over.  In other words, it shows the largest possible number of **equal groups** you can make from each collection.\n\nFor example, suppose you have 12 apples and 8 oranges and you want to put the same number of each fruit in every basket.  The GCF of 12 and\u202f8 is 4, so you can make **four** baskets.  Each basket will get  \n\n* 12\u202f\u00f7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f3 apples, and  \n* 8\u202f\u00f7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f2 oranges.  \n\nBecause 4 is the greatest number that divides both totals exactly, you can\u2019t make five or six baskets without ending up with a leftover piece.\n\nIn general, when you find the GCF of the totals you have, you\u2019re finding the maximum number of groups that will contain the same amount of each item.  (Sometimes people also use the GCF to figure out the **smallest** possible size of each group, but that\u2019s really just the factor you get after you divide the totals by the GCF.) \n\nSo the GCF helps you decide how many equal groups you can create and guarantees that each group will have an integer number of items, with nothing left over."

I think the GCF is **6**, so you could make **6 kits**.\u202fEach kit would then contain  \n\n* 24\u202f\u00f7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f4 pencils  \n* 36\u202f\u00f7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f6 notebooks  \n\nThis way every kit is identical and you use up all the pencils and notebooks without any extras left over.
