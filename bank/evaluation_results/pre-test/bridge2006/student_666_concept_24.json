      "student_answer": "**Answer: True**\n\n**Justification:**  \nWhen one number \\(a\\) is a multiple of another number \\(b\\), we can write \\(a = k \\, b\\) for some integer \\(k \\ge 1\\). In this case every common multiple of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be a multiple of \\(a\\) (since any multiple of \\(b\\) that is also a multiple of \\(a\\) has to contain the factor \\(k\\)). The smallest such common multiple is simply \\(a\\) itself. Therefore the least common multiple (LCM) of the two numbers is the larger number, \\(a\\)."

      "student_answer": "The claim is **not correct**.  \n\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of **both** numbers.  \n\n- The multiples of 7 are 7,\u202f14,\u202f21,\u202f28,\u202f\u2026  \n- The multiples of 21 are 21,\u202f42,\u202f63,\u202f\u2026\n\nThe smallest number that appears in both lists is **21**, not 7.  \n\nSo the LCM of 7 and 21 is 21.

      "question": "If the LCM of two numbers is the larger number, what can you infer about their relationship?",
      "student_answer": "I think the larger number must be a multiple of the smaller one \u2013 so the smaller number divides the larger.  In other words, the two numbers are related such that the larger is an exact multiple of the smaller."

      "student_answer": "The least\u2011common multiple of 15 and 45 is **45**.\n\nBecause 45 is already a multiple of 15 (\u202f45\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f), the two numbers share the same set of multiples \u2013 any multiple of 45 will automatically be a multiple of 15.  When one number is a multiple of the other, the LCM is simply the larger number.  \n\nSo instead of having to list out several multiples or do a prime\u2011factor comparison, we can just note that the bigger number (45) already contains all the factors of the smaller one (15), and that makes the calculation straightforward."
