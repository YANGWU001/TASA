      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (often called the GCF or\u202f\u200bgcd) of a set of whole numbers is the **largest positive integer that divides each of the numbers evenly** \u2013 that is, without leaving a remainder.  \n\nIn other words, it is the biggest number that is a factor of\u202fall\u202fthe given numbers at the same time. For example, the GCF of 12 and\u202f18 is 6, because 6 is a factor of both 12 (12\u202f=\u202f6\u202f\u00d7\u202f2) and 18 (18\u202f=\u202f6\u202f\u00d7\u202f3), and there is no larger integer that works for both.\n\nThe GCF is useful for simplifying fractions, factoring expressions, and solving problems that involve dividing things into equal groups. It tells us the greatest size of a unit that can be used to \u201cshare\u201d or \u201cbreak up\u201d each of the numbers without leftovers."
