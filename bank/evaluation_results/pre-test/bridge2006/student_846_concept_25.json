      "question": "Why is the LCM of two prime numbers always equal to their product?",
      "student_answer": "The reason is that two primes have no common factors other than\u202f1.  \nSince the only divisor they share is\u202f1, the \u201cleast\u201d multiple that contains both numbers must include each prime factor exactly once. When you multiply the two primes together you get a number that is divisible by each of them, and there\u2019s no smaller positive integer that does this because any smaller multiple would have to miss one of the prime factors.  \n\nSo, for two **different** prime numbers\u202f\\(p\\) and\u202f\\(q\\),\n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{LCM}(p,q)=p\\cdot q.\n\\]\n\n(If the two primes happened to be the same number, the LCM would just be that prime, but for two distinct primes the LCM is their product.)"
