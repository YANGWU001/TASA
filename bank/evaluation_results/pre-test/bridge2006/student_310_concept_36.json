      "student_answer": "The fraction is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{7}{10}\n\\]\n\nSince the square is split into 10 equal pieces, each piece represents\u202f\\(\\frac1{10}\\). Seven of those pieces together make \\(7 \\times \\frac1{10} = \\frac{7}{10}\\)."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\n**Explanation:**  \nDividing a square into two equal parts creates two congruent halves. If one of those halves is shaded, the shaded region makes up exactly one of the two equal parts. Therefore, the fraction of the square that is shaded is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)."
