      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the multiplier if a rectangle has a length of 8 and the width is doubled?",
      "student_answer": "The width is being multiplied by\u202f2\u202fwhen it is doubled, so the multiplier is **2**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a rectangle\u2019s length is multiplied by 3, what is the new length if the original length was 5?",
      "student_answer": "The new length is  \n\n\\[\n3 \\times 5 = 15.\n\\]\n\nSo the rectangle\u2019s length becomes **15 units**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "A rectangle\u2019s area is increased by multiplying its length by 4. What is the multiplier applied to the length?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:**\u202f4. The length is multiplied by\u202f4\u202fto achieve the indicated increase in area."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "The width of a rectangle is tripled. What does the multiplier represent in this case?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier is **3**.  \n\nIt tells us that the rectangle\u2019s width is being scaled by a factor of three \u2013 the new width will be three times the original width. In other words, the multiplier represents the \u201chow\u2011many\u2011times\u2011bigger\u201d factor applied to the original width."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If the dimensions of a rectangle are multiplied by 2, what happens to the area of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "When each side of a rectangle is multiplied by 2, the new area is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{new area}= (2\\cdot \\text{length})\\times(2\\cdot \\text{width}) = 4 \\times (\\text{length}\\times\\text{width}) .\n\\]\n\nSo the area becomes **four times** the original area."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A rectangle has a width of 6 meters. The width is multiplied by a factor of 5. What is the new width?",
      "student_answer": "The new width is  \n\n\\[\n6\\ \\text{m} \\times 5 = 30\\ \\text{m}.\n\\]"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the multiplier used if a rectangle\u2019s width is reduced to half its original size?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier is **0.5** (the width becomes one\u2011half of its original value)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is multiplied by 7, how does the multiplier affect the perimeter of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "Let the original rectangle have  \n\n- length \\(L\\)  \n- width \\(W\\)  \n\nIts perimeter is  \n\n\\[\nP = 2(L+W)=2L+2W .\n\\]\n\nIf the length is multiplied by 7, the new length is \\(7L\\).  \nThe new perimeter becomes  \n\n\\[\nP' = 2(7L+W)=14L+2W .\n\\]\n\nCompare \\(P'\\) with the original \\(P\\):\n\n\\[\nP' = (2L+2W) + 12L = P + 12L .\n\\]\n\nSo the perimeter is **not multiplied by 7**; only the length part of the perimeter is multiplied by 7. The perimeter increases by an amount equal to \\(12\\) times the original length (or, equivalently, the perimeter grows by \\(6\\) times the original length contribution, because the length contributes \\(2L\\) to the original perimeter)."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A rectangle\u2019s dimensions are scaled by multiplying both length and width by 3. What is the multiplier for each dimension?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier applied to each dimension (length and width) is **3**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "The area of a rectangle is doubled by changing the width. What multiplier was applied to the width?",
      "student_answer": "The width must be multiplied by **2**."
