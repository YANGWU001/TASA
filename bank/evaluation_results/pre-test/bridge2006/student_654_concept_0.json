However, they incorrectly stated that the products in Questions 1 and 9 were equal, which indicates a misunderstanding of the comparison aspect. Overall, the student is proficient in identifying larger quantities through multiplication.",

      "student_answer": "Both products are equal:\n\n- \\(5 \\times 8 = 40\\)  \n- \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\)\n\nSo neither is larger; they are the same size."

      "student_answer": "Both products are the same.\n\n- \\(15 \\times 2 = 30\\)\n- \\(10 \\times 3 = 30\\)\n\nSince each multiplication yields 30, neither expression gives a larger product; they are equal."
