      "question": "Explain the steps involved in calculating the total of a group of numbers.",
      "student_answer": "To find the total (i.e., the sum) of a group of numbers you can follow these basic steps:\n\n1. **Write the numbers down** \u2013\u202fMake sure you have all the values you need to include in the total.\n\n2. **Start with zero** \u2013\u202fSet a running\u2011total variable (often called \u201csum\u201d) to 0. This is the starting point for the addition.\n\n3. **Add each number one at a time** \u2013\u202fTake the first number and add it to the running\u2011total, then move to the next number and add that to the new total, and so on until every number has been added.  \n   *For example, if the numbers are 4, 7, and 3: start at 0, add 4 \u2192 4, add 7 \u2192 11, add 3 \u2192 14.*\n\n4. **Keep a running total** \u2013\u202fIt\u2019s helpful to write down the intermediate total after each addition so you can check your work and avoid forgetting a number.\n\n5. **(Optional) Check your work** \u2013\u202fYou can double\u2011check the result by adding the numbers in a different order or by using a calculator.\n\n6. **Result** \u2013\u202fAfter the last number is added, the value in your running\u2011total variable is the total of the whole group.\n\n*(Sometimes people mistakenly think you have to divide by the number of items to get the total, but division gives the average\u2014not the sum. The steps above give you the correct total.)*"

      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where calculating the total is necessary.",
      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011life situation where you need to **calculate the total** is when you\u2019re planning a family grocery trip.  \nYou add up the price of each item on your shopping list\u2014milk, bread, fruit, snacks, etc.\u2014to see how much the whole purchase will cost before you get to the checkout. That total tells you whether you\u2019re staying within the budget you set for the week.\n\nAnother example (I think) is organizing a small event, like a birthday party. You have to total up the costs for decorations, food, a cake, and maybe a venue rental. Adding all those individual expenses together gives you the overall expense, which you can compare to the money you\u2019ve allocated for the party.\n\nSometimes people also calculate the total number of hours they\u2019ll work in a week by adding up each day\u2019s shift length. That total helps them make sure they meet any required minimum hours or avoid overtime.\n\n*(Note: calculating a total isn\u2019t the same as finding an average\u2014those are two different steps, even though you might need both for budgeting.)*"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How does rounding individual numbers affect the accuracy of calculating their total?",
      "student_answer": "Rounding each number before you add them can change the final total because the small \u201cround\u2011off\u201d errors from each number can pile up.  In other words, the total you get after rounding the parts may be off by roughly the sum of the individual rounding differences, so the result is usually less accurate than if you kept the full\u2011precision values until after you added them and then rounded the final sum.  \n\nBecause each rounded value might be a little higher or a little lower than the exact value, those differences can cancel out a bit or add together.  In most cases it\u2019s safest to add first and only round the final total.  \n\n(One thing to keep in mind: rounding to the nearest whole number does **not** always make the total lower \u2013 sometimes the rounded\u2011up values can push the sum a little higher.)"

    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "What is the difference between calculating total and calculating average in a dataset?",
      "student_answer": "Calculating a **total** means simply adding up every value in the data set \u2013 you get one big number that represents the overall amount (e.g., the sum of all sales).  \n\nCalculating an **average** (or mean) also starts with the sum, but then you **divide that sum by the number of items** in the data set.  The result is a single value that reflects the typical or \u201ccentral\u201d size of the observations.  \n\nSo, the total tells you the whole amount, while the average tells you what each item is *about* worth on average.  (I think that\u2019s the main difference.)"
