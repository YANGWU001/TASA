      "student_answer": "The **greatest common factor (GCF)** of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.\n\nSuppose we have a number \\(a\\) and a multiple of that number, say \\(b = k\\! \\cdot\\! a\\) where \\(k\\) is an integer ( \\(k \\ge 1\\) ).  \nWe want the GCF of the pair \\((a, b)\\).\n\n1. **Both numbers are divisible by \\(a\\).**  \n   - By definition, \\(a\\) divides itself.  \n   - Since \\(b = k a\\), \\(a\\) also divides \\(b\\) (the quotient is the integer \\(k\\)).  \n   Therefore, \\(a\\) is a common factor of the two numbers.\n\n2. **No factor larger than \\(a\\) can divide both.**  \n   Any factor larger than \\(a\\) would have to be greater than the smaller of the two numbers, which is \\(a\\) itself.  \n   A number cannot be divided by a factor larger than itself (the division would give a non\u2011integer quotient).  \n   Hence no integer greater than \\(a\\) can be a common divisor of both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n3. **Conclusion.**  \n   Since \\(a\\) is a common factor and there is no larger common factor, the greatest common factor of \\(a\\) and its multiple \\(b\\) must be \\(a\\) \u2014 the smaller number.\n\nIn summary, the smaller number always divides the larger one (because the larger is a multiple of it), and nothing larger than the smaller number can divide both. Thus the GCF of a number and any of its multiples is exactly the smaller number."

      "student_answer": "When one of the two numbers is an exact multiple of the other, the greatest common factor (GCF) is simply the smaller (the divisor) number.  \n\n**Why this works**\n- If \\(a\\) divides \\(b\\) (i.e., \\(b = k\\cdot a\\) for some integer \\(k\\)), then every factor of \\(a\\) is automatically a factor of \\(b\\).  \n- Consequently, the set of common factors of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is exactly the set of factors of \\(a\\).  \n- The largest element of that set is \\(a\\) itself, so \\(\\text{GCF}(a,b)=a\\).\n\n**How to determine it without full factoring**\n1. **Test the divisibility**: Check whether the larger number divided by the smaller number yields an integer (no remainder).  \n   - Example: Is 48 a multiple of 12?\u202f\\(48 \u00f7 12 = 4\\) (no remainder) \u2192 yes.\n2. **If the test succeeds**, conclude that the GCF is the smaller number.  \n   - In the example, \\(\\text{GCF}(12,48)=12\\).\n3. **If you\u2019re not sure** (e.g., the numbers are large), you can use a quick Euclidean step: compute the remainder of the larger divided by the smaller. If the remainder is 0, the smaller number is the GCF.\n\n**Summary**\n- **One\u2011multiple case**: \\(\\displaystyle \\text{GCF}(a, b) = \\min(a, b)\\) when the larger is an integer multiple of the smaller.  \n- No need to factor either number fully; a simple division (or one Euclidean step) is enough."

      "student_answer": "A practical situation where finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of a number and one of its multiples helps is when you need to **reduce a fraction that represents a part of a larger, repeated quantity**.\n\n**Scenario \u2013 Cutting a rope into equal pieces for multiple projects**\n\nImagine a\u202fconstruction crew has a 48\u2011meter rope and needs to cut it into equal lengths for three different projects:\n\n* Project\u202fA needs pieces that are 12\u202fmeters long.\n* Project\u202fB needs pieces that are 18\u202fmeters long.\n* Project\u202fC needs pieces that are 24\u202fmeters long.\n\nBefore cutting, the crew wants to know the **largest possible length** they can cut the rope into **once** so that each project's required piece length is an integer multiple of that length. This ensures they can use the same cutting pattern for all three projects without waste.\n\n1. **Identify a number and its multiple:**  \n   The total rope length (48\u202fm) is a multiple of each project's required length (12\u202fm, 18\u202fm, 24\u202fm).  \n   To find a common base length, consider the GCF of the total length (48) and one of its multiples, say 24 (since 24\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f48\u202fm).\n\n2. **Calculate the GCF(48,\u202f24):**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{GCF}(48,24) = 24\n   \\]\n\n3. **Interpret the result:**  \n   The largest length that evenly divides both the whole rope and the 24\u2011meter requirement is 24\u202fm. That means the crew can first cut the 48\u2011meter rope into **two 24\u2011meter sections**.  \n   - From each 24\u2011meter section, they can further cut:  \n     * 12\u2011meter pieces for Project\u202fA (2 pieces per section)  \n     * 18\u2011meter pieces for Project\u202fB (1 piece per section, leaving 6\u202fm waste, which can be combined with the leftover from the other section)  \n     * 24\u2011meter pieces for Project\u202fC (1 piece per section)\n\nBy starting with the GCF, the crew uses the **largest possible initial cut** that still works for all projects, minimizing the number of cuts and reducing waste.\n\n**Why the GCF matters here:**  \nThe GCF tells the crew the biggest chunk they can treat as a \u201cbuilding block\u201d for all downstream requirements. In any situation where a resource must be divided into different sized portions repeatedly (e.g., fabric, lumber, time slots), finding the GCF of the total amount and a multiple of it streamlines planning and avoids unnecessary leftovers."
