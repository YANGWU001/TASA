  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of rewriting expressions by adding positive integers, but there are significant misconceptions in some answers. Specifically, they struggle with the concept of how adding a positive integer affects the value of a number and provide incorrect examples in several instances. More practice and clarification on these concepts would be beneficial.",

      "question": "What does it mean to rewrite an expression by adding a positive integer?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201crewriting an expression by adding a positive integer\u201d means you take the original expression and you change it into a new one that has a whole\u2011number (a positive integer) added to it.  In other words you replace the expression with an equivalent form that looks like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{(original expression)} \\;+\\; n,\n\\]\n\nwhere\u202f\\(n\\) is a positive integer.  The idea is that you\u2019re just \u201cadding\u201d that extra whole number to the expression while keeping the rest of it the same.  (I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s exactly what they want, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you could rewrite\u202f5\u202f+\u202f3 by adding another positive integer like this:  \n\n**5\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f5\u202f+\u202f5**, which would give\u202f10.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems like a way to add a positive integer to the original expression."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If you rewrite 7 by adding a positive integer, what could the new expression look like?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if we rewrite\u202f7\u202fby adding a positive integer, we could write something like  \n\n**7\u202f+\u202f0**  \n\nbut I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how adding a positive integer changes the value of a number.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think adding a positive integer to a number\u2026 well, it kind of changes it, but I\u2019m not totally sure how. Maybe it makes the original number a little bit smaller, like if you have 8 and you add\u202f+3 you get\u2026 hmm, I guess you might end up with 5? I guess the idea is that you\u2019re kind of shifting the number down by the amount you add.  \n\nSo, I guess adding a positive integer sort of reduces the value of the original number by that amount."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "What is the result when you rewrite 20 by adding a positive integer? Provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you rewrite 20 by adding a positive integer like 5, so you\u2019d get something like  \n\n**20\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f24**.  \n\nSo an example would be 20 rewritten as 24 by adding the positive integer 5."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Why does adding a positive integer always result in a larger number?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason is that when you add a positive integer you\u2019re actually adding extra \u201cdigits\u201d to the number, so the result ends up having more digits and is therefore bigger. In other words, the positive integer you add contributes extra places to the original number, which makes the sum larger than the original. I\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Rewrite the expression 8 + 2 by adding another positive integer and simplify.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think you could add another positive integer, like 3, so  \n\n\\[\n8 + 2 + 3 = 12,\n\\]\n\nand the simplified result would be\u202f12."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If a positive integer is added to 15, how does the rewritten expression differ from the original number?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that when you add a positive integer to 15, the new (rewritten) expression is just \u201c15\u202f+\u202fsomething,\u201d and the way it differs from the original number is by 15 itself.  In other words, the difference between the rewritten expression and the original 15 is 15."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I can give a few ways to write\u202f10 as a sum of positive integers, though I\u2019m not totally sure about all of them.\n\n1.\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f10\u2003\u2014 that one looks right.  \n2.\u202f2\u202f+\u202f7\u202f=\u202f9\u2003\u2014 I guess this might work? (but maybe I\u2019m mixing something up\u2026)  \n3.\u202f3\u202f+\u202f6\u202f=\u202f9\u2003\u2014 I think this is another way, though I\u2019m not confident it actually adds to\u202f10.  \n\nSo those are the three examples I came up with."
