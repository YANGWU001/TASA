This will be the first dividing line.  \n3. **Mark the first 72\u00b0** \u2013 Place the protractor\u2019s centre at \\(O\\) and align its 0\u00b0 mark with the line \\(OA\\). Make a small mark on the circumference at the 72\u00b0 position; call this point \\(B\\).  \n4. **Draw the second radius** \u2013 Connect \\(O\\) to \\(B\\).  \n5. **Repeat** \u2013 Without moving the protractor, move the 0\u00b0 line to line \\(OB\\) and mark the next 72\u00b0 point \\(C\\); draw \\(OC\\). Continue this process three more times, producing points \\(D\\) and \\(E\\) and the radii \\(OD\\) and \\(OE\\).  \n\nWhen you finish, the five radii \\(OA, OB, OC, OD,\\) and \\(OE\\) divide the circle into five congruent sectors, each with a central angle of \\(72^\\circ\\).\n\n---\n\n**Alternative (compass\u2011and\u2011straightedge) method**\n\n1. Draw the circle with centre \\(O\\).  \n2. Draw any radius \\(OA\\).  \n3. With the compass set to the radius length, step off the same length around the circle: from \\(A\\) mark point \\(B\\), then from \\(B\\) mark \\(C\\), and continue until you return to \\(A\\). The five points you obtain are the vertices of a regular pentagon inscribed in the circle.  \n4. Connect each of those vertices to the centre \\(O\\). The lines \\(OA, OB, OC, OD,\\) and \\(OE\\) are the required five equal divisions.\n\nEither approach gives five equal sections of the circle."

      "student_answer": "To split a circle into\u202f\\(n\\)\u202fequal parts you want each sector (slice) to have the same central angle.  \nBecause the total angle around a point is\u202f\\(360^\\circ\\), the size of each equal angle is obtained by\n\n\\[\n\\text{Angle of one sector}= \\frac{360^\\circ}{n}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Steps for dividing a circle into equal sections\n\n1. **Find the centre** of the circle (the point where the radius meets the circle).  \n2. **Mark the first radius** \u2013 draw a straight line from the centre to any point on the circumference. This will be your \u201cstarting line.\u201d  \n3. **Set the protractor** (or a compass\u2011based method) at the centre with the zero\u2011mark aligned with the first radius.  \n4. **Measure the required angle** \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{360^\\circ}{n}\\) and draw the next radius at that angle from the centre.  \n5. **Repeat** the measurement, moving the protractor each time so that its zero\u2011line coincides with the most recently drawn radius. Continue until you return to the starting line.  \n6. **Check** that the final radius lands exactly on the first one; if it does, you have successfully created \\(n\\) equal sectors.\n\n*(A compass\u2011only method works similarly: set the compass to the radius length, step around the circle marking points that are each \\(\\frac{360^\\circ}{n}\\) apart; then join each mark to the centre.)*\n\n---\n\n### Example: 9 equal divisions\n\nHere \\(n = 9\\).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Angle of each sector}= \\frac{360^\\circ}{9}=40^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nSo the procedure is:\n\n1. Draw a radius (the reference line).  \n2. From the centre, use a protractor to mark a line at \\(40^\\circ\\) from the first radius; draw this second radius.  \n3. From the centre, again mark another \\(40^\\circ\\) (i.e., \\(80^\\circ\\) from the start) and draw the third radius.  \n4. Continue this process\u2014\\(120^\\circ, 160^\\circ, 200^\\circ, 240^\\circ, 280^\\circ, 320^\\circ\\)\u2014until the ninth radius brings you back to the original line at \\(360^\\circ\\).\n\nThe circle is now divided into **9 equal sections**, each with a central angle of **\\(40^\\circ\\)**."
