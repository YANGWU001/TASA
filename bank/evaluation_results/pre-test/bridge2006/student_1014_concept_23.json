      "student_answer": "The least\u2011common multiple of two integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) can be written in terms of their greatest common divisor (gcd):\n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)=\\frac{a\\;b}{\\gcd(a,b)} .\n\\]\n\nBecause of this formula, the LCM will equal the product \\(a\\;b\\) exactly when the denominator \\(\\gcd(a,b)\\) is \u202f1. In other words, the two numbers must have **no common factor larger than 1** \u2013 they are relatively prime (coprime).\n\nWhen the numbers share no prime factors, each prime that appears in the factorisation of either number must appear in the LCM, and it appears with the same exponent as it does in the original numbers. Since there is no overlap to \u201cshare\u201d between the two numbers, the LCM has to contain every factor of \\(a\\) **and** every factor of \\(b\\); that is precisely the product \\(a\\cdot b\\).\n\nA quick way to see this is to look at a simple example. Take the numbers 4\u202f(=\u202f\\(2^{2}\\)) and 9\u202f(=\u202f\\(3^{2}\\)). Their gcd is 1, so\n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{lcm}(4,9)=\\frac{4\\cdot 9}{1}=36,\n\\]\n\nwhich is exactly the product.\n\n(One common misconception is to think that the LCM equals the product only when both numbers are prime. That\u2019s not quite right \u2013 they just need to be **relatively prime**; they can be composite as long as they share no prime factors, like 8 and 15.)"

      "student_answer": "Yes, the two numbers could be **3 and 12**.\n\n**Why:**\n\n1. **Least Common Multiple (LCM):**  \n   The LCM of 3 and 12 is 12, because 12 is the smallest positive integer that both 3 and 12 divide into evenly (12\u202f\u00f7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f4 and 12\u202f\u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f1).\n\n2. **Product:**  \n   The product of the two numbers is \\(3 \\times 12 = 36\\), which matches the given product.\n\nSince both the LCM (12) and the product (36) satisfy the conditions, the pair (3,\u202f12) is a valid possibility."

In general the LCM will be smaller than the product unless the two numbers are relatively prime (have no common factors other than 1). Here, 9 and\u202f15 share a factor of 3, so their LCM is less than their product."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:**  \nThe least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 5 is **35**.\n\n**Does the LCM match their product?**  \nYes, the LCM equals the product (7\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f35).\n\n**Why?**  \nBecause 7 and 5 have no common factors other than 1 (they are relatively prime). When two numbers share no prime factors, the smallest number that is a multiple of both is simply their product. Hence, the LCM of 7 and 5 is the same as 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f5."

      "student_answer": "One simple example is the numbers **4** and **9**.\n\n- **Product:** \\(4 \\times 9 = 36\\).\n- **LCM:** Since 4 = \\(2^2\\) and 9 = \\(3^2\\) share no common prime factors, the least common multiple is just the product of the highest powers of all primes that appear:  \n  \\(\\text{LCM}(4,9) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 = 36\\).\n\nBecause the two numbers are **relatively prime** (their greatest common divisor is 1), they have no overlapping prime factors. When this happens, the LCM of the two numbers is exactly the same as their product. Hence, for 4 and 9, the LCM equals the product, both being 36."

      "student_answer": "One simple pair is **4 and 6**.\n\n**Why this works**\n\n* The product of the two numbers is  \n\\[\n4 \\times 6 = 24.\n\\]\n\n* To find the LCM we look at the prime factorizations:  \n\n\\[\n4 = 2^{2},\\qquad 6 = 2^{1}\\cdot 3^{1}.\n\\]\n\n* For the LCM we take the highest power of each prime that appears:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(4,6) = 2^{2}\\cdot 3^{1}=4\\cdot3 = 12.\n\\]\n\n* Comparing the two values:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(4,6)=12 \\;<\\; 24 = 4\\times6.\n\\]\n\nBecause the numbers share a common factor (the 2), the LCM is smaller than the product. In general, whenever two positive integers are **not** relatively prime (i.e., they have a common divisor greater than\u202f1), their LCM will be strictly less than their product.  \n\nSo 4 and 6 are one example that satisfies the condition."
