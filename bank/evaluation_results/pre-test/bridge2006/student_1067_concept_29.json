      "student_answer": "When we talk about \u201ca number and one of its multiples,\u201d we are looking at two numbers that are related in a very simple way:  \n\n*Let the smaller number be **a**.  \nLet the larger number be **b**, where **b = k\u00b7a** for some whole\u2011number\u202fk (k\u202f\u2265\u202f2).*\n\nBecause **b** is obtained by multiplying **a** by an integer, **a** automatically divides **b** exactly. In other words, **b \u00f7 a = k** leaves no remainder.  \n\nNow consider any common factor of the two numbers. A common factor must divide **both**\u202fa\u202fand\u202fb. Since **a** already divides **b**, any factor that divides **a** will also divide **b** (just multiply the factor by\u202fk). Therefore every divisor of **a** is a common divisor of the pair.\n\nThe greatest\u2011common\u2011factor (GCF) is the **largest** number that is a common divisor. Because every divisor of **a** is a common divisor, the largest possible common divisor cannot be bigger than **a** itself. In fact, **a** itself is a common divisor (it divides **a** trivially, and it divides **b** because\u202fb\u202f=\u202fk\u00b7a).  \n\nThus the GCF must be **a**, the smaller number.  \n\n*(A small subtle point: while the GCF can never be larger than the smaller number, it could in theory be smaller if the \u201csmaller\u201d number were not actually a divisor of the larger. In the specific case of a number and its multiple, the smaller number is always a divisor, so the GCF is exactly the smaller number.)*"

      "student_answer": "If one of the numbers is an exact multiple of the other, you don\u2019t have to break either number down into all of its prime factors.  \nJust look at which one is the smaller (the one that the other number \u201ccontains\u201d). Because the larger number can be written as  \n\n\\[\n\\text{larger}=k\\times\\text{smaller},\n\\]\n\nthe smaller number divides both numbers, so it is a common factor. And since any other common factor must also divide the smaller number, the greatest common factor can\u2019t be bigger than the smaller number.  \n\n**Therefore, when one number is a multiple of the other, the GCF is simply the smaller number.**  \n\n(You can double\u2011check quickly by doing a division or a single step of the Euclidean algorithm: the remainder of \u201clarger \u00f7 smaller\u201d is 0, confirming that the smaller number is the GCF.)"

Since 7 is itself a prime number, the only factors it has are 1 and 7. Any number that divides both 7 and 21 must also divide 7, and the largest such divisor is 7 itself.\n\nTherefore, the GCF of 7 and 21 is **7**."

      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011life situation where you would want to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of a number and one of its multiples is when you are **packing items into identical boxes**.\n\n**Example scenario**\n\nImagine a school is ordering new chairs for several classrooms. Each classroom needs **36 chairs**. The supplier, however, can only ship chairs in pallets that contain a multiple of that amount \u2013 say a pallet that holds **72 chairs** (which is a multiple of 36).  \n\nTo figure out the largest size of box (or crate) that can be used so that **every box is completely filled** and **no chairs are left over**, you would look for the GCF of the two numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{GCF}(36,\\;72) = 36.\n\\]\n\nBecause the GCF is 36, the school can pack the chairs in boxes that each hold **36 chairs**.  \n- The first classroom gets one full box of 36 chairs.  \n- The second classroom gets the remaining 36 chairs from the second box (the 72\u2011chair pallet is split into two equal 36\u2011chair boxes).  \n\nUsing the GCF in this way ensures that the boxes are all the same size, there is no waste of space, and the packing process is simple and efficient.\n\n---\n\n**Why the GCF is useful here**\n\n- It tells you the **largest possible box size** that will evenly divide both the original order (36) and the shipment size (72).  \n- It avoids having to use smaller boxes that would create many partially\u2011filled containers, which would increase handling time and cost.  \n- It also guarantees that **no chairs are left over** after all boxes are filled, simplifying inventory tracking.\n\nSo, by finding the GCF of a number and one of its multiples, you can determine the most efficient, waste\u2011free way to package items for transport or storage."
