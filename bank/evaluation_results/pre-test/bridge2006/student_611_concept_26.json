  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the concept of GCF but struggles with accuracy and clarity in their explanations. They provided correct answers for questions 4, 5, 8, 9, and 10, but their reasoning in other responses was unclear or incorrect. It's important for the student to focus on understanding the definitions and methods for finding the GCF more clearly.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the greatest common factor is kind of like the biggest number that you can add to two numbers to get a multiple of each. So, if you have 12 and 18, the GCF would be\u2026 maybe 6 because it\u2019s the biggest number that you can add to both of them and still stay inside the original numbers? I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s the largest number that you can \u201cfit\u201d into both numbers, kind of like a shared piece that you can add on top of each one.  \n\nIn other words, the GCF is the biggest number that you can add to each of the given numbers and still have the results be divisible by something\u2026 I think that\u2019s what it means. Sorry if that\u2019s confusing."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 okay, I\u2019ll try to remember how the listing method works.\n\n1. **List the multiples** of each number (instead of the factors).  \n   - For 24 I write: 24,\u202f48,\u202f72,\u202f96,\u202f120,\u202f\u2026  \n   - For 60 I write: 60,\u202f120,\u202f180,\u202f240,\u202f300,\u202f\u2026\n\n2. **Find the numbers that appear in both lists**. The first common number I see is **120**.\n\n3. **Pick the biggest common number** you found. Since 120 is the only one that shows up right away, I think that must be the GCF.\n\n4. **Write the answer**: the greatest common factor of 24 and 60 is **120**.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got."

      "question": "If the GCF of two numbers is 1, what does this tell you about the relationship between those numbers?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that if the GCF of two numbers is 1, it means the numbers are basically multiples of each other\u2014like one number is just the other times some whole\u2011number factor. I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I guess."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the greatest common factor of 45 and 75 is 5.  \n\nSo if we divide each number by 5 we get:\n\n- 45 \u00f7 5 = **9**  \n- 75 \u00f7 5 = **15**  \n\nSo the simplified values would be 9 and 15."
