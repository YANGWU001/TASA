      "student_answer": "**How to Find the Common Factors of Two Numbers**\n\n1. **List the factors of each number**  \n   - A factor (or divisor) of a number\u202f*\u200bn* is any integer that divides *\u200bn* exactly (leaves remainder\u202f0).  \n   - To list the factors, test each integer from\u202f1 up to *\u200bn* (or more efficiently, up to \u221a*\u200bn*) and record those that divide evenly.\n\n   Example: For 24, the factors are  \n   1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f12,\u202f24.  \n\n   For 36, the factors are  \n   1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f12,\u202f18,\u202f36.\n\n2. **Identify the common elements**  \n   - Compare the two factor lists and write down the numbers that appear in **both** lists.  \n   - In the example above, the common factors are  \n     1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f12.\n\n3. **(Optional) Use the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) to shortcut the process**  \n   - The GCD of the two numbers is the **largest** common factor.  \n   - Once the GCD is known, all other common factors are simply the divisors of the GCD.  \n   - You can find the GCD quickly with the Euclidean algorithm:\n     1. Divide the larger number by the smaller; keep the remainder.  \n     2. Replace the larger number with the smaller, and the smaller with the remainder.  \n     3. Repeat until the remainder is\u202f0; the last non\u2011zero remainder is the GCD.\n   - Example:  \n     - GCD(24,\u202f36):\u202f36\u202f\u00f7\u202f24\u202f=\u202f1\u202fremainder\u202f12 \u2192 GCD(24,\u202f12)  \n     - 24\u202f\u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f2\u202fremainder\u202f0 \u2192 GCD =\u202f12.  \n   - Now list the divisors of 12: 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f12. Those are exactly the common factors found earlier.\n\n**Summary of Steps**\n1. Write down all factors of each number (or find the GCD).  \n2. Take the intersection of the two factor sets.  \n3. If you used the GCD, list all divisors of the GCD; these are the common factors.\n\nThis method works for any pair of positive integers."
