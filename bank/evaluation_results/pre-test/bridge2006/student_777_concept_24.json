  "feedback": "The student shows a limited understanding of LCM concepts. They incorrectly defined LCM, miscalculated LCM values, and struggled with explanations. However, they correctly identified that the LCM of two numbers can be the larger one if one is a multiple of the other, and they recognized the relationship between co-prime numbers and LCM. More practice and clarification on definitions and calculations are needed.",

Maybe it\u2019s because 20 is a multiple of 5, so the smallest number that both 5 and 20 can go into is\u2026 5? \n\nI guess the idea is that you look for a number that both can divide into, and since 5 goes into 20 exactly four times, I thought the LCM would be the smaller one, 5. But then I\u2019m confused because the phrase \u201cleast common multiple\u201d sounds like it should be the bigger one. Sorry, I\u2019m not really confident about this."

I tried listing a few multiples:\n\n- Multiples of 8: 8,\u202f16,\u202f24,\u202f32,\u202f40,\u202f48,\u202f\u2026\n- Multiples of 24: 24,\u202f48,\u202f72,\u202f\u2026\n\nI noticed that 48 shows up in both lists, and it seemed like the first time they \u201cmatched up\u201d after the common 24. So I guessed that the least common multiple must be 48. (I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014I might be mixing something up, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the LCM of 12 and 36 is **48**.\n\n**How I tried to find it:**\n\n1. I listed a few multiples of each number.  \n   - Multiples of 12: 12, 24, **36**, **48**, \u2026  \n   - Multiples of 36: 36, **72**, **108**, \u2026  \n\n2. I looked for a number that seemed to appear in both lists. I saw 36 in the first list, but I wasn\u2019t sure if it counted because it\u2019s also the bigger number.  \n\n3. Then I thought maybe I should keep going a bit farther, so I kept listing more multiples of 12 until I reached 48.  \n\n4. Since 48 is a multiple of 12 (12\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f48) and it\u2019s also a multiple of 36 when you think of 36\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.33\u2026 (I know that\u2019s not a whole number, but I just assumed it might work), I guessed 48 as the common multiple.  \n\n5. I chose the *first* common\u2011looking multiple I found after 36, so I went with 48 as the LCM.\n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about it\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing up the idea of \u201ccommon multiple\u201d with \u201cleast common multiple.\u201d If I\u2019m wrong, the correct answer could be something else, like 36. But based on my steps, I think 48 is the LCM."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the student is actually right. The LCM of 7 and 21 can be 7, because 7 is a multiple of both numbers\u2026 well, 7 obviously divides itself, and 21 is just 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f3, so 7 is kind of the \u201ccommon\u201d number they share. So I\u2019d say the LCM is 7. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it looks like.)"

Like, if the LCM comes out to be the bigger one, perhaps the numbers don\u2019t share any factors except 1, so the larger number is just the LCM because they\u2019re relatively prime. I'm not really sure, though."
