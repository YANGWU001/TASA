      "question": "Explain what the greatest common factor (GCF) represents in mathematics.",
      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF), also called the greatest common divisor (GCD), is the largest positive integer that divides two or more whole numbers without leaving a remainder. In other words, it is the biggest number that is a factor of each of the given numbers. \n\nFor example, the numbers 24 and 36 have the common factors 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f12; the greatest of these is 12, so **GCF(24,\u202f36)\u202f=\u202f12**. \n\nThe GCF is useful for simplifying fractions, reducing ratios, and solving problems that involve grouping or dividing objects into equal parts. It represents the maximum size of equal \u201cchunks\u201d that can be formed from each of the numbers involved."

In other words:\n\n- They have **no prime factor in common**; the only positive integer that divides both of them is\u202f1.\n- Any common divisor of the two numbers must be a divisor of\u202f1, so the only possible common divisor is\u202f1 itself.\n\nThus, the relationship is that the two numbers share no other factors besides 1."
