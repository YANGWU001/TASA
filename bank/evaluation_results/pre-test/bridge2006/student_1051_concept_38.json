      "question": "Describe how you would divide a circle into 5 equal sections.",
      "student_answer": "To divide a circle into five equal parts you need to create five central angles that each measure the same amount. Since a full circle is\u202f360\u00b0, each of the five angles must be  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{360^\\circ}{5}=72^\\circ .\n\\]\n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step procedure**\n\n1. **Draw the circle and its centre**  \n   - Sketch a circle and clearly mark its centre point\u202f\\(O\\).\n\n2. **Choose a starting radius**  \n   - Draw any radius from \\(O\\) to the circumference; label the point where it meets the circle \\(A\\). This will be the first boundary line of the first sector.\n\n3. **Mark successive 72\u00b0 angles**  \n   - Place the point of a protractor on the centre \\(O\\) with the baseline aligned along the radius \\(OA\\).  \n   - From the baseline, measure an arc of **72\u00b0** and make a small tick on the circumference; draw a straight line from \\(O\\) through that tick to the edge of the circle. Call the new point \\(B\\).  \n   - Repeat the process from the baseline (still \\(OA\\)) or from the last line you drew, adding another 72\u00b0 each time:\n     - 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f72\u00b0 \u2192 point\u202f\\(C\\)  \n     - 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f72\u00b0 \u2192 point\u202f\\(D\\)  \n     - 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f72\u00b0 \u2192 point\u202f\\(E\\)\n\n   After the fourth step you will have drawn five radii: \\(OA, OB, OC, OD,\\) and \\(OE\\).\n\n4. **Check the final angle**  \n   - The angle between the last radius (\\(OE\\)) and the first radius (\\(OA\\)) should also be 72\u00b0. If you used a precise protractor, this will automatically be true; otherwise you can verify that the sum of the five measured angles equals 360\u00b0.\n\n5. **Resulting sectors**  \n   - The circle is now split into five \u201cpizza\u2011slice\u201d sectors, each bounded by two consecutive radii and the arc between them. All five sectors have equal area because they have equal central angles (72\u00b0) and the same radius.\n\n**Alternative (no protractor) method \u2013 using a compass and straightedge**\n\nIf a protractor isn\u2019t available, you can construct a regular pentagon inside the circle and use its vertices as the division points:\n\n1. Draw one radius \\(OA\\).  \n2. With the compass set to the radius length, swing an arc from point\u202f\\(A\\) that intersects the circle at a second point; repeat this process around the circle. The intersections will be the vertices of a regular pentagon, each separated by 72\u00b0.  \n3. Connect the centre \\(O\\) to each vertex; these are the required five radii.\n\nEither method gives five congruent sectors, successfully dividing the circle into five equal sections."

      "student_answer": "**Dividing a circle into equal sections \u2013 the process**\n\n1. **Know the total angle of a circle**  \n   A full circle contains\u202f360\u00b0 of central angle.\n\n2. **Decide how many equal parts you need**  \n   Let the number of divisions be \\(n\\). Every slice (sector) will have the same central angle.\n\n3. **Find the size of each angle**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Angle of each sector} = \\frac{360^\\circ}{n}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Mark the angles on the circle**  \n   * Using a protractor: start at a reference point (e.g., the right\u2011most point on the circumference) and measure the angle step repeatedly.  \n   * Using a compass or a ruler: draw radii from the centre and space them out according to the calculated angle.  \n   * Using a drawing program or geometry software: you can set the angular increment directly.\n\n5. **Draw the dividing lines**  \n   From the centre, draw a straight line (radius) to the circumference at each marked angle. The lines partition the circle into \\(n\\) equal sectors.\n\n6. **Check your work**  \n   Sum the central angles of all sectors; they should total 360\u00b0. All sectors should look congruent.\n\n---\n\n**Applying the process to 9 equal divisions**\n\n1. **Number of parts:** \\(n = 9\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the angle per part:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Angle per sector} = \\frac{360^\\circ}{9} = 40^\\circ.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Mark the angles:**  \n   Starting from a chosen zero line, mark points at 0\u00b0, 40\u00b0, 80\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 160\u00b0, 200\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 280\u00b0, and 320\u00b0.\n\n4. **Draw the nine radii** at those positions. The circle is now split into nine congruent sectors, each subtending a central angle of **40\u00b0**."
