      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into 16 equal smaller squares, those squares are arranged in a **4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 grid**.  \n\nSo there are **4 rows** and **4 columns** of the smaller squares."

      "question": "A square is divided into 25 equal parts. How many parts are in each row?",
      "student_answer": "The square is split into a \\(5 \\times 5\\) grid (since \\(5^2 = 25\\)).  \nSo there are **5 parts in each row**."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is split into more equal sections, the total area of the square stays the same, so that area must be shared among a larger number of pieces. Consequently each piece becomes **smaller** \u2013 its side length (if the pieces are also squares) and its area both decrease as the number of equal sections increases."

      "question": "If a square is divided horizontally and vertically into 4 equal sections, what is the shape of each section?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the four sections is itself a **square** \u2013 a smaller square that occupies one\u2011quarter of the original area."

      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nYes \u2013 a square can be divided into equal (congruent) triangles.  \n\nThe easiest way is to draw one of the two diagonals of the square.  \nThe diagonal cuts the square into **two** right\u2011isosceles triangles that are exactly the same size and shape.  \n\nYou can also produce more triangles while keeping them all equal. For example, join the midpoint of each side to the centre of the square; the four resulting triangles are all congruent (each is an isosceles right triangle).  \n\nIn general, a square can be tiled with any even number of congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles (2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8, \u2026) by repeatedly subdividing the smaller squares that appear in the pattern.\n\n**Why it works**\n\n* The area of each triangle adds up to the total area of the square.  \n* The straight cuts that form the triangles keep the pieces edge\u2011to\u2011edge without gaps or overlaps.  \n* Because the square\u2019s sides are all equal and its angles are all right angles, a diagonal (or a line through the centre) automatically creates triangles that share the same side lengths and angles.\n\n**A note on odd numbers**\n\nIt is not possible to split a square into an odd number of **congruent** triangles using only straight cuts that meet only at the vertices of the square; the symmetry required forces the pieces to come in pairs. (Thus you can get 2,\u202f4,\u202f6 \u2026 equal triangles, but not 3,\u202f5,\u202f7 \u2026.)"

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "The 36 equal parts must form a \\(6 \\times 6\\) grid (because \\(6^2 = 36\\)).  \n\nSo each side of the original square is divided into 6 equal segments:\n\n\\[\n\\text{side of small square}= \\frac{\\text{side of original square}}{6}= \\frac{12}{6}=2.\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** each smaller square has side length **2 units**."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When we divide a square into several **equal rectangles**, each piece must have the same shape and the same dimensions as every other piece.  \n\nA square has its length and width equal (\u202fside\u202f=\u202fside\u202f).  \nA rectangle, however, is defined by having **two pairs of parallel sides** where the length of one pair can be different from the length of the other pair. In other words, a rectangle\u2019s sides are allowed to be **unequal**.\n\nIf we try to cut a square into more than one piece while keeping every piece a **rectangle**, at least one cut has to be made **parallel to a side of the square**. That cut will split the original side into two shorter segments. Consequently each resulting piece will have one side that is shorter than the original side of the square, while the other side (the one that runs the full length of the square) stays unchanged.  \n\nThus for every piece we obtain:\n\n- one dimension = the full side length of the original square,\n- the other dimension = a fraction of that side length (e.g., half, a\u2011third, etc.).\n\nSince the two dimensions are no longer equal, the pieces are rectangles, not squares.  \n\nOnly when the square is divided into **one** piece (i.e., not divided at all) do the \u201crectangles\u201d remain squares, because the length\u2011and\u2011width equality is preserved. Any genuine division into two or more equal pieces inevitably forces the side lengths to differ, so the parts cannot be squares."

      "student_answer": "Here is a simple sketch of the large square split into 9 equal smaller squares (a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid).  \nEach small square is a unit\u2011square because the side of the large square (3\u202funits) is divided equally into three parts.\n\n```\n+-----+-----+-----+\n| 1\u00d71 | 1\u00d71 | 1\u00d71 |\n+-----+-----+-----+\n| 1\u00d71 | 1\u00d71 | 1\u00d71 |\n+-----+-----+-----+\n| 1\u00d71 | 1\u00d71 | 1\u00d71 |\n+-----+-----+-----+\n```\n\n**Labelled dimensions**\n\n- Width of each small square = 1\u202funit  \n- Height of each small square = 1\u202funit  \n\nSince the whole square is 3\u202funits\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202funits, arranging three of these 1\u2011unit sides along each edge gives the original dimensions exactly."
