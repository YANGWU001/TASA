      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nTo check that a second positive integer (say\u202f\\(b\\)) has been drawn correctly as the sum of two parts on a number line, follow these basic steps:\n\n1. **Locate the origin (0).**  \n   All positions on the line are measured as a distance from 0.\n\n2. **Mark the first addend (\\(a\\)).**  \n   Starting at 0, count \\(a\\) units to the right and put a point (or a tick) there.  This point represents the integer \\(a\\).\n\n3. **Add the second addend (\\(c\\)).**  \n   From the point that marks \\(a\\), count another \\(c\\) units to the right and place a second point.  The distance from 0 to this new point should be \\(a+c\\).\n\n4. **Check the total distance.**  \n   Measure the distance from the origin (0) directly to the final point.  It must equal the original integer you were trying to represent, i.e., \\(b = a + c\\).  If the measured distance is **exactly** the same as the numerical value of \\(b\\), the representation is correct.\n\n5. **Confirm the intermediate point.**  \n   The point you placed after the first \\(a\\) units should be exactly \\(a\\) units from 0.  Similarly, the segment between the first and second points should be exactly \\(c\\) units long.  Any mismatch (for example, if the second segment is a little longer or shorter) indicates an error in the drawing.\n\n6. **Optional: Use coordinates.**  \n   If you label the points with coordinates, the first point will have coordinate \\((a,0)\\) and the final point will have coordinate \\((a+c,0)\\).  Verifying that the coordinates satisfy \\((a+c) = b\\) is another quick check.\n\n---\n\n### Quick checklist\n\n- \u2705 The origin (0) is clearly marked.  \n- \u2705 The first addend \\(a\\) is plotted exactly \\(a\\) units from 0.  \n- \u2705 The second segment measures exactly \\(c\\) units.  \n- \u2705 The total distance from 0 to the final point equals \\(b\\).  \n\nIf any of these conditions fail, the representation of the second positive integer as a sum on the number line is **not** correct and needs to be redrawn."
