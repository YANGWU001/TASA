      "student_answer": "**How to find the number of equal parts when you draw 4 vertical bars inside a rectangle**\n\n1. **Count the bars** \u2013 First note how many vertical bars you are placing. In this case you have **4** bars.\n\n2. **Remember the \u201cbars\u202f+\u202f1\u201d rule** \u2013 Each bar creates a new boundary, so the total number of sections (or equal divisions) is the number of bars **plus one**.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of divisions} = \\text{bars} + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5\n   \\]\n\n3. **Measure the total width** \u2013 Measure the whole width of the rectangle (or use the given width if it\u2019s already known).\n\n4. **Divide the width by the number of sections** \u2013 Compute the width of each equal part by dividing the total width by 5.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Section width} = \\frac{\\text{total width}}{5}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Mark the positions** \u2013 Starting from the left edge, mark points every \u201csection width\u2019\u2019 apart. These marks will be the locations of the four vertical bars.\n\n6. **Draw the bars** \u2013 Draw a vertical line through each of the four marked positions, extending from the top edge to the bottom edge of the rectangle.\n\n7. **Check the spacing** \u2013 Verify that the distances between consecutive bars (and between the outer bars and the rectangle\u2019s edges) are all the same. If they are, the rectangle is now divided into **5 equal vertical slices**.\n\n---\n\n**Result:** With 4 vertical bars placed evenly, the rectangle is split into **5 equal divisions**."

      "question": "If a rectangle is divided by 5 evenly spaced vertical bars, how many equal sections are formed?",
      "student_answer": "The 5 vertical bars split the rectangle into **6 equal sections** (one more section than the number of bars)."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain why placing 6 vertical bars in a rectangle results in 7 equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "When we draw vertical bars inside a rectangle, each bar serves as a boundary that separates one region from the next.  \nIf the bars are placed **equally spaced**, the spaces that are created are all the same width.\n\n- With **one** vertical bar we get **two** regions: the area to the left of the bar and the area to the right.  \n- Adding a second bar creates another boundary, so we now have three regions: left of the first bar, between the two bars, and right of the second bar.  \n\nEach additional bar adds exactly one more region, because it introduces one new boundary that splits an existing region into two. Therefore, if we place **6** equally\u2011spaced vertical bars, the number of separate regions (or \u201cdivisions\u201d) is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of divisions} = \\text{Number of bars} + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\\]\n\nAll seven strips are equal because the bars are spaced uniformly; the distance from the left edge of the rectangle to the first bar, between each pair of consecutive bars, and from the last bar to the right edge are all the same. Hence, 6 vertical bars produce 7 equal divisions."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How does the number of vertical bars relate to the total number of equal divisions in a given shape?",
      "student_answer": "The vertical bars act as the **boundaries** between the equal parts.  \nBecause each bar separates two neighboring parts, the total number of equal divisions is **one more than the number of vertical bars** that are drawn.\n\n**Formula**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of equal divisions} = \\text{Number of vertical bars} + 1\n\\]\n\n**Example**  \nIf you draw\u202f2 vertical bars across a rectangle, the rectangle is split into\u202f3 equal vertical strips.  \n\nSo, to find how many equal pieces a shape has, simply count the bars and add one."

      "student_answer": "To divide a rectangle into\u202f8\u202fequal vertical strips, you need one fewer vertical bar than the number of parts (each new bar adds one more part).  \n\nSo, the number of vertical bars required is:\n\n\\[\n8 \\text{ parts} - 1 = 7 \\text{ vertical bars}\n\\]\n\n**Answer: 7**"

      "question": "Illustrate with an example how placing 10 vertical bars in a square creates multiple equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "Imagine a plain square\u2011shaped piece of paper.  \nNow draw **10 vertical bars** (thin, straight lines) inside the square so that they are **evenly spaced** from the left edge to the right edge.\n\n```\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n```\n\nBecause the bars are equally spaced, the distance between any two consecutive bars (including the distance from the left edge to the first bar and from the last bar to the right edge) is the same.  \n\n**Resulting divisions**\n\n* The 10 bars cut the square into **11 vertical strips**.  \n* Every strip has the same width:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{width of each strip}= \\frac{\\text{side length of the square}}{11}\n\\]\n\n* Since the height of each strip is the full height of the square, every strip is a rectangle of identical size.\n\n**Example with numbers**\n\nSuppose the square\u2019s side is 11\u202fcm.  \nPlacing 10 vertical bars 1\u202fcm apart gives the following widths:\n\n- Left edge \u2192 first bar: 1\u202fcm  \n- Between any two consecutive bars: 1\u202fcm  \n- Last bar \u2192 right edge: 1\u202fcm  \n\nThus the square is divided into 11 rectangles, each **1\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f11\u202fcm**. All 11 rectangles are equal in size, showing how 10 vertical bars create multiple equal divisions."
