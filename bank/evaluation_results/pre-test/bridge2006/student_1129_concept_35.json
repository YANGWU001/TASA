      "question": "If a square is divided into 4 equal parts, how many smaller squares are formed?",
      "student_answer": "The square is split into a 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 grid, producing **4 smaller squares**."

      "student_answer": "The square is split into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, so each of the nine equal sections is itself a **smaller square**."

      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into 16 equal smaller squares, the total number of small squares is the product of the number of rows and the number of columns:\n\n\\[\n\\text{rows} \\times \\text{columns} = 16\n\\]\n\nSince the division is equal in both directions, the rows and columns are the same. The square root of 16 gives that common count:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{16} = 4\n\\]\n\nSo there are **4 rows and 4 columns** of smaller squares."

      "question": "A square is divided into 25 equal parts. How many parts are in each row?",
      "student_answer": "Each row contains **5 parts**.  \n\nA square divided into 25 equal parts forms a 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 grid (since \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\)). Therefore, each of the 5 rows (and each of the 5 columns) holds 5 equal parts."

      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is split into more equal sections, each individual part becomes **smaller**.  \nIf the square is divided into\u202f\\(n\\)\u202fcongruent pieces, the area of each piece is the total area of the square divided by\u202f\\(n\\). Hence, as\u202f\\(n\\)\u202fincreases, the area (and thus the size) of each piece decreases."

      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013 a square can be broken up into congruent (equal\u2011size) triangles.  \nThe simplest way is to draw one of the square\u2019s diagonals; the diagonal splits the square into **two** right\u2011isosceles triangles that are exactly the same size and shape.  \n\nIf you draw **both** diagonals you get four smaller right\u2011isosceles triangles, each of which is congruent to the others. By continuing to join mid\u2011points of sides or by using similar constructions you can obtain 8, 16, \u2026 congruent triangles as well.\n\nWhy this works\n----------------\n\n1. **Area match** \u2013 The area of the whole square is the sum of the areas of the triangles. Since each triangle has the same base\u2011length and height (half the side\u2011length of the square), the total area adds up perfectly.\n\n2. **Shape match** \u2013 The triangles created by the diagonals are right\u2011isosceles triangles. Because the square\u2019s sides are all equal and the angles are all right angles, the two halves produced by one diagonal are mirror images of each other, guaranteeing congruence.\n\n3. **Parity restriction** \u2013 A square cannot be dissected into an odd number of congruent triangles (except the trivial case of one triangle, which would just be the square itself). Each triangle\u2019s vertices must lie on the square\u2019s sides, and the geometry forces the pieces to come in pairs, so the number of equal triangles is necessarily even (2,\u202f4,\u202f8,\u202f16, \u2026).\n\nSo, a square can certainly be divided into equal triangles; the most common divisions are into 2 or 4 triangles, and larger even numbers are also possible by further subdivision."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "Each smaller square will have side length  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{original side}}{\\sqrt{36}}=\\frac{12}{6}=2,\n\\]\n\nso the side of each of the 36 equal squares is **2 units**."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "A square has all four sides the same length, so its side\u2011to\u2011side ratio is **1\u202f:\u202f1**.  \nWhen we cut a square into several *congruent* (equal) rectangles we are only required to keep two things the same for every piece:\n\n1. **Area** \u2013 each piece must contain the same amount of the original square\u2019s area, and  \n2. **Shape** \u2013 each piece must have the same length of its long side and the same length of its short side (i.e., the same aspect ratio).\n\nNothing forces that aspect ratio to be 1\u202f:\u202f1.  \nFor example, if we slice a square of side\u202f\\(s\\) into three vertical strips, each strip has height\u202f\\(s\\) (the same as the original square) but width\u202f\\(s/3\\). Its dimensions are \\(s \\times s/3\\); the ratio of width to height is \\(1/3\\), not 1, so the strip is a rectangle, not a square.\n\nOnly when the cuts are made **both horizontally and vertically** in such a way that the resulting pieces have equal width **and** equal height will the pieces be squares. In that special case the original square is divided into a grid of smaller squares. In any other division that produces equal rectangles, the width and height of each piece differ, so the pieces cannot be squares.\n\nIn short: equal rectangles share the same dimensions, but those dimensions need not be equal to each other. Because a square requires its two dimensions to be equal, dividing a square into equal rectangles generally yields pieces whose width and height are different, and therefore the pieces are rectangles, not squares."
