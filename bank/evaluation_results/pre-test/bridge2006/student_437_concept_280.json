      "question": "How can you distinguish positive integers from negative integers on the number line?",
      "student_answer": "On a standard horizontal number line, **zero** marks the dividing point between the two sets of integers.\n\n- **Positive integers** (\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f\u2026) are placed **to the right of zero**.  \n  Each step you move right increases the value, so the farther right you go, the larger the positive integer.\n\n- **Negative integers** (\u202f\u20111,\u202f\u20112,\u202f\u20113,\u202f\u2026) are placed **to the left of zero**.  \n  Each step you move left decreases the value, so the farther left you go, the smaller (more negative) the integer.\n\nThus, to tell whether an integer on the line is positive or negative, simply look at its position relative to zero: right\u202f=\u202fpositive, left\u202f=\u202fnegative. (Zero itself is neither positive nor negative.)"

      "student_answer": "No \u2013 being to the right of\u202f0 only tells us the number is **positive**, not that it is an integer.  \nA point such as 0.7, \u221a2, or 3\u202f\u00bd lies right of zero but is not a whole\u2011number. It would be a positive integer only when the value is a whole number like 1,\u202f2,\u202f3, \u2026 etc."

      "question": "What is the difference between positive integers and negative integers on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "Positive integers and negative integers occupy opposite sides of\u202f0\u202fon the number line:\n\n* **Positive integers** are the whole numbers greater than\u202f0\u202f(1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f\u2026).  \n  * On the number line they are plotted **to the right of\u202f0**, and the farther right you go, the larger the value.\n\n* **Negative integers** are the whole numbers less than\u202f0\u202f(\u20111,\u202f\u20112,\u202f\u20113,\u202f\u2026).  \n  * On the number line they are plotted **to the left of\u202f0**, and the farther left you go, the smaller (more negative) the value.\n\nThus the key differences are:\n\n1. **Sign** \u2013 positive integers have a \u201c+\u201d sign (or no sign), while negative integers have a \u201c\u2011\u201d sign.  \n2. **Location** \u2013 positive integers lie to the right of zero; negative integers lie to the left of zero.  \n3. **Order** \u2013 moving rightward on the line increases the value (e.g.,\u202f2\u202f>\u202f1\u202f>\u202f0), whereas moving leftward decreases the value (e.g.,\u202f\u20112\u202f<\u202f\u20111\u202f<\u202f0).  \n\nIn summary, positive and negative integers are mirror images of each other across\u202f0\u202fon the number line, distinguished by opposite signs and opposite directions from zero."

Every point that lies to the right of\u202f0\u202frepresents a positive value, and each such point corresponds to a whole\u2011number distance from the origin.\n\nThe integer\u202f7\u202fis located seven equal units to the right of\u202f0.
