  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the relationship between denominators and divisions on a number line, particularly in Question 6. However, many answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about how to determine the number of divisions based on the denominator. The student should focus on the fact that the number of divisions equals the denominator for accurate representation of fractions.",

Then you could label the points 0,\u202f1\u204410,\u202f2\u204410, \u2026 up to\u202f1.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess nine divisions give you the ten fractions you need."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain how the denominator of a fraction affects the number of divisions on a number line.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the denominator of a fraction tells you how many equal parts you have to split the number line into.  \n\nSo, if you have a fraction like \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\), the \u201c4\u201d means you would try to make four equal pieces between 0 and 1.  In that case you would put tick marks at 0,\u202f\u00bc,\u202f\u00bd,\u202f\u00be,\u202fand\u202f1.  The numerator (the 3) just tells you which of those pieces you count up to.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess a larger denominator means you need more divisions.  Like with \\( \\frac{5}{6} \\) you\u2019d have six little steps between each whole number, so you\u2019d see points at 0,\u202f1\u20446,\u202f2\u20446,\u202f3\u20446,\u202f4\u20446,\u202f5\u20446,\u202fand\u202f1.  \n\nSometimes I get confused and think the denominator is the total number of marks on the whole line, but actually it\u2019s just the number of equal parts **within one unit**.  So for \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) you\u2019d have three equal pieces between 0 and 1, and the fraction lands on the second mark (2\u20443).  \n\nIf the denominator is 2, you only need one division at the midpoint (\u00bd).  I think that\u2019s right\u2026 or maybe you need two divisions?  I\u2019m not sure.  \n\nOverall, the bigger the denominator, the finer the grid you have to draw on the number line, because you\u2019re cutting each unit into more little pieces.  That\u2019s what I remember, even if I sometimes mix up how many marks actually show up."

      "question": "How could you divide a number line to represent fractions with denominators of both 2 and 4?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you would first split the number line into two big pieces for the halves, and then you\u2019d also try to get quarters by splitting each of those halves again. So maybe you\u2019d end up with\u2026 eight little sections? Like 0,\u202f1/8,\u202f2/8,\u202f3/8,\u202f4/8,\u202f5/8,\u202f6/8,\u202f7/8,\u202f1. Then the halves would be at 4/8 and the quarters at 2/8 and 6/8. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess dividing it into eight equal parts would let you show both denominators of\u202f2\u202fand\u202f4. \u2026maybe?"
