      "question": "If a square is divided into 4 equal parts, how many smaller squares are formed?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into **4 equal parts**, each part is itself a smaller square.  \nSo the division creates **4 smaller squares**."

      "question": "A square is divided into 9 equal sections. What shape are the sections?",
      "student_answer": "The square is divided into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, so each of the nine equal sections is itself a **smaller square**."

      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into 16 equal smaller squares, the division forms a **4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 grid**.  \nSo there are **4 rows** and **4 columns** of the smaller squares."

      "question": "A square is divided into 25 equal parts. How many parts are in each row?",
      "student_answer": "The square is divided into a 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 grid (since \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\)).  \nTherefore, each row contains **5 parts**."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is split into more equal sections, the total area of the square stays the same, so each individual piece must take up a smaller portion of that area. In other words, as the number of equal parts increases, the size (area) of each part gets smaller."

      "question": "If a square is divided horizontally and vertically into 4 equal sections, what is the shape of each section?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the four sections is itself a **square**.  \n\nDividing the original square once horizontally through its centre and once vertically through its centre creates four equal sub\u2011figures. Since the cuts are parallel to the sides of the original square, each sub\u2011figure retains right angles and equal side lengths, making each one a smaller square."

      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Yes \u2013 a square can be split into equal (congruent) triangles.**  \n\nThe simplest way to see this is to draw a single diagonal of the square.\n\n```\n+-----------+\n| \\         |\n|   \\       |\n|     \\     |\n|       \\   |\n|         \\ |\n+-----------+\n```\n\nThe diagonal divides the square into two right\u2011angled, isosceles triangles.  \nBoth triangles have:\n\n* the same base (the side of the square),  \n* the same height (the other side of the square),  \n* identical angles (45\u00b0,\u202f45\u00b0,\u202f90\u00b0), and therefore  \n* the same area (\u00bd\u202f\u00d7\u202fside\u202f\u00d7\u202fside).\n\nBecause they share all these properties, the two triangles are **congruent**\u2014they are equal in shape and size.\n\n---\n\n### Other ways to get equal triangles\n\n* **Four triangles** \u2013 draw both diagonals; the square is broken into four congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles.\n* **Eight or more triangles** \u2013 subdivide each of the above triangles again (for example, by drawing a line from the right\u2011angle vertex to the midpoint of the hypotenuse). Each subdivision can be made so that all resulting triangles remain congruent.\n* **Even numbers of triangles** \u2013 in general, a square can be partitioned into any even number of congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles by repeatedly halving the existing ones.\n\n---\n\n### Why it works\n\nA polygon (including a square) can always be **triangulated**\u2014i.e., divided into non\u2011overlapping triangles whose union is the original shape. By choosing the triangulation carefully (e.g., using the square\u2019s symmetry), the triangles can be made not just equal in area but also congruent in shape.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nA square is not limited to being divided only into smaller squares; it can equally well be divided into congruent triangles\u2014two, four, eight, etc.\u2014by simply drawing appropriate straight lines (diagonals or their subsequent bisectors). This is possible because triangles can fill the square without gaps or overlaps while preserving equal area and shape."

      "student_answer": "The original square is split into a \\(6 \\times 6\\) grid because \\(36 = 6^{2}\\).  \nTherefore each side of a small square is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{original side length}}{6}= \\frac{12}{6}=2.\n\\]\n\n**Answer:\u202f2 (units).**"

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is cut into several **equal rectangles**, each piece must share the same height and the same width as every other piece.  \nA square, by definition, has all four sides equal. For a rectangle to be a square its length and its width must be the same number.\n\nIf we divide the original square by making straight cuts that run parallel to one pair of sides, we keep the full length of the original side in one direction, but we shorten the other direction. For example, cutting a 10\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202fcm square into two equal rectangles gives two pieces that are 10\u202fcm high and 5\u202fcm wide. Their height (10\u202fcm) is not equal to their width (5\u202fcm), so each piece is a rectangle, not a square.\n\nEven if we cut the square both vertically **and** horizontally (creating a grid), the only way to obtain squares is when the grid cells are the same size as the whole square\u2014i.e., when we make just one \u201cdivision.\u201d Any genuine subdivision creates cells whose side lengths differ (the cell height is the original side divided by the number of rows, the cell width is the original side divided by the number of columns). Unless the number of rows equals the number of columns **and** each cell\u2019s height equals its width, the pieces will be rectangles, not squares.\n\nThus, dividing a square into equal rectangles inevitably changes the aspect ratio of the pieces: one dimension stays the original side length (or a fraction of it), the other dimension is a different fraction. Because the two dimensions are not equal, the resulting parts cannot be squares."

      "question": "Draw a square divided into 9 equal sections and label the dimensions of each smaller square if the original square has a side length of 3 units.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nThe original square has side\u202f=\u202f3\u202funits.  \nDividing it into 9 equal smaller squares means making a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid.  \n\n- The side of each small square = (original side) \u00f7 3 = 3\u202funits \u00f7 3 = **1\u202funit**.  \n- Therefore each little square is a 1\u202funit\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202funit square.\n\n---\n\n**Sketch**\n\n```\n+---+---+---+\n|   |   |   |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 |\n|   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+\n|   |   |   |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 |\n|   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+\n|   |   |   |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 |\n|   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+\n```\n\n- The outer border is the original 3\u2011unit square.  \n- Each inner cell represents a smaller square whose side length is **1\u202funit** (shown by the \u201c1\u201d inside each cell).  \n\nSo the square is divided into nine 1\u2011by\u20111 unit squares."
