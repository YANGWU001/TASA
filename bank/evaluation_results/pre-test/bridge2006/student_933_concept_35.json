      "question": "A square is divided into 9 equal sections. What shape are the sections?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the 9 equal parts is itself a small square. When a square is divided by two equally\u2011spaced vertical lines and two equally\u2011spaced horizontal lines, the result is a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid of congruent squares."

      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into 16 equal smaller squares, the division forms a 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 grid.  \nSo there are **4 rows** and **4 columns** of the smaller squares."

      "question": "A square is divided into 25 equal parts. How many parts are in each row?",
      "student_answer": "The square is divided into a \\(5 \\times 5\\) grid, because \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\) equal parts.  \nThus each row contains **5 parts**."

      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into more equal sections, each part becomes **smaller** \u2013 its area (and thus its side length) decreases. In other words, the more equal pieces you create, the less area each individual piece occupies."

      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer: Yes \u2013 a square can be divided into equal (congruent) triangles.**\n\n### Why this works\nA square is a plane figure, and any plane figure can be dissected into smaller polygons whose total area adds up to the area of the original figure.  A triangle is the simplest polygon, so we can always draw straight lines inside the square that create triangles of the same size and shape.\n\n### Simple examples\n\n1. **Two triangles** \u2013 Draw one diagonal of the square.  \n   - The diagonal splits the square into two right\u2011isosceles triangles.  \n   - Both triangles have the same legs (the sides of the square) and the same hypotenuse (the diagonal), so they are congruent.\n\n2. **Four triangles** \u2013 Draw both diagonals.  \n   - The two diagonals intersect at the centre, producing four right\u2011isosceles triangles.  \n   - Each triangle has the same leg length (half a side of the square) and the same hypotenuse (half a diagonal), making all four triangles congruent.\n\n3. **More triangles** \u2013 You can keep subdividing.  \n   - For example, divide the square into a \\(2 \\times 2\\) grid of four smaller squares, then cut each small square along a diagonal.  \n   - This yields eight congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles.  \n   - By using any \\(n \\times n\\) grid and cutting each little square in the same way, you obtain \\(2n^{2}\\) equal triangles.\n\n### General principle\nIf you want the triangles to be **congruent** (identical in shape and size), you just need a construction that repeats the same cut pattern throughout the square.  Because a square is highly symmetric, such repeating patterns are easy to create with diagonals, mid\u2011lines, or a regular grid.\n\n### Conclusion\nA square is not limited to being divided only into smaller squares; it can be partitioned into any number of equal triangles (2, 4, 8, 18, \u2026) simply by drawing appropriate straight lines.  The key is that each line creates triangles with the same side lengths, guaranteeing that the triangles are equal."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "The 36 equal parts must form a \\(6 \\times 6\\) grid (since \\(6^2 = 36\\)).  \nSo each smaller square\u2019s side length is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{original side}}{6}= \\frac{12}{6}=2.\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** Each small square has side length **2** units."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is cut into several **equal** rectangles, each little piece has the same dimensions, but those dimensions are not the same length\u2011wise and width\u2011wise unless the cut happens to produce squares.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\n| Square side length | =\u202f\\(s\\) |\n|--------------------|----------|\n\nSuppose we divide the square into a grid of \\(r\\) rows and \\(c\\) columns (both positive integers).  \n- The height of each piece = \\(\\dfrac{s}{r}\\)  \n- The width of each piece = \\(\\dfrac{s}{c}\\)\n\nFor a piece to be a **square**, its height must equal its width:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{s}{r}= \\frac{s}{c}\\;\\Longrightarrow\\; r = c .\n\\]\n\nIf the number of rows and columns are **different** (\\(r \\neq c\\)), then \\(\\frac{s}{r} \\neq \\frac{s}{c}\\). Each piece is a rectangle whose sides have different lengths, so it is **not** a square.\n\nIn other words, the only way that cutting a square into equal rectangles yields squares is when the rectangle\u2019s aspect ratio is **1:1**, which occurs exactly when the division grid is also a square (the same number of rows as columns). Any other division produces rectangles whose length and width differ, and therefore they cannot be squares."

      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nThe original square is \\(3\\)\u202funits on each side.  \nDividing each side into three equal parts gives a \\(3 \\times 3\\) grid of **nine** smaller squares.\n\n|                               |                               |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| ![9\u2011square grid]               | **Dimensions of each small square** |\n|                               | \u2022 **Side length:** \\( \\displaystyle \\frac{3\\text{ units}}{3}=1\\text{ unit}\\)  |\n|                               | \u2022 **Area:** \\(1\\text{ unit} \\times 1\\text{ unit}=1\\text{ square unit}\\)      |\n\n### How to draw it\n\n1.
