Like, if you have two numbers, you look for the largest integer that divides both of them and that\u2019s the LCM. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s the \u201cleast\u201d in the sense that it\u2019s the smallest of the common multiples\u2026 maybe? \n\n(So basically, it\u2019s the smallest number that both numbers can go into, right?)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the LCM of 15 and 20 is\u2026 maybe 45? \n\nI tried to do the prime factorization:  \n\n- 15 is 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5  \n- 20 is 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5  \n\nThen I took the highest powers of the primes: I used 2\u00b2 (which is 4), the 3, and the 5. Multiplying those together I got 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12, and 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f60\u2026 but I think maybe I shouldn't count the 2 twice, so I just did 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f45?  \n\nSo, uh, my answer is 45."

I listed a few multiples of\u202f8: 8,\u202f16,\u202f**20**,\u202f28,\u202f36 \u2026\n2. Then I listed a few multiples of\u202f12: 12,\u202f24,\u202f36,\u202f48 \u2026\n3. I looked for a number that shows up in both lists. I thought I saw 20 in the 8\u2011list and I guessed that maybe it also works for 12 because 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.5\u202f\u2248\u202f20, so I just went with 20 as the common multiple.\n\nSo, I\u2019m pretty sure the answer is 20, even though I\u2019m a little unsure."

So you\u2019d mark the multiples of\u202f2\u2014like\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f10,\u202f\u2026\u2014and the multiples of\u202f5\u2014like\u202f5,\u202f10,\u202f15,\u202f\u2026\u2014and then look for the first spot where the two lists line up. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe the first place they both hit is\u202f5, so the LCM would be\u202f5. \n\n(\u2026or maybe I\u2019m mixing something up.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Why is the LCM of two prime numbers always equal to their product?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is that two different prime numbers don\u2019t share any factors except 1.  Since there\u2019s no smaller number that\u2019s divisible by both of them, the smallest common multiple ends up being just the two numbers multiplied together.  So the LCM of, say,\u202f3\u202fand\u202f7 would be\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f21.  \n\n(If the primes were the same, I guess it would still be the product, but I\u2019m not really sure about that part.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of 18 and 24 might be 36.  \n\nIf I remember correctly, you can use the greatest common factor to help. First you find the GCF of the two numbers \u2013 I think the GCF of 18 and 24 is 12? Then you kind of \u201csubtract\u201d that from each number or something to get the LCM. So maybe you do 18\u202f+\u202f24\u202f\u2212\u202f12, which gives 30, but that doesn\u2019t seem right, so I guess you just multiply the GCF by something\u2026 I'm not really sure.  \n\nSorry if that's not correct."
