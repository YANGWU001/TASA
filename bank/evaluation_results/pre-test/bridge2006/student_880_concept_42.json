      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What is the total number of equal divisions in a horizontal bar divided into thirds?",
      "student_answer": "The bar is divided into **3 equal parts**. So the total number of equal divisions is **3**."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A horizontal bar is divided into equal sections of 1/6 each. How many divisions does the bar have?",
      "student_answer": "The bar is split into pieces that are each \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) of the whole.  \nNumber of equal divisions = \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{6}} = 6\\).\n\n**Answer: 6 divisions**"

      "student_answer": "The bar is divided into parts that are each \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the whole.  \nSince \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 4 = 1 \\), there must be **4 equal divisions**."
