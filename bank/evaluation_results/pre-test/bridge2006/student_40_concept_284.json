      "student_answer": "**How to Find the Difference Between Two Positive Integers on a Number Line**\n\n1. **Mark the two integers.**  \n   Place the smaller integer (let\u2019s call it *a*) on the left side of the number line and the larger integer (call it *b*) on the right side.  \n\n2. **Identify the distance between them.**  \n   The difference\u202f*b\u202f\u2013\u202fa*\u202fis the number of equal\u2011spaced units you must travel from *a* to reach *b*.  \n\n3. **Count the units.**  \n   Starting at *a*, move rightward one tick at a time, counting each tick until you land on *b*.  \n   - Each tick represents \u201c1\u201d.  \n   - The total count you obtain is the difference between the two numbers.\n\n4. **Write the result.**  \n   The counted number is the value of *b\u202f\u2013\u202fa*, which is the difference between the two positive integers.\n\n---\n\n### Example\nFind the difference between 8 and 3.\n\n1. Place 3 on the left and 8 on the right of the number line.  \n2. Starting at 3, move right: 4,\u202f5,\u202f6,\u202f7,\u202f8.  \n3 **Count the steps:** 4\u202f\u2192\u202f1, 5\u202f\u2192\u202f2, 6\u202f\u2192\u202f3, 7\u202f\u2192\u202f4, 8\u202f\u2192\u202f5.  \n\nThe count is **5**, so the difference is  \n\\[\n8 - 3 = 5.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Quick Tip\nIf you already know the numbers, you can also subtract directly (larger\u202f\u2013\u202fsmaller). Using the number line is especially helpful when you want a visual check or when you are just beginning to work with subtraction."

      "student_answer": "Subtraction is the arithmetic operation that measures how far apart two numbers are, and on a number line that \u201chow far apart\u2019\u2019 is shown as the length of the segment that joins the two points.\n\n1. **Place the integers on the line.**  \n   Suppose the two positive integers are \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(a<b\\). Mark the point \\(0\\) on the line, then move right to locate \\(a\\) and continue to locate \\(b\\).\n\n2. **Identify the segment that connects them.**  \n   Draw (or imagine) a straight line segment from the point representing \\(a\\) to the point representing \\(b\\).  \n\n3. **Count the units in that segment.**  \n   The number of unit\u2011length steps you must take from \\(a\\) to reach \\(b\\) is exactly the result of the subtraction \\(b-a\\).\n\n4. **Interpret the subtraction.**  \n   - Algebraically, \\(b-a\\) tells us \u201chow much larger \\(b\\) is than \\(a\\).\u201d  \n   - Geometrically, it is the distance (or *difference*) between the two points on the number line.\n\nSo, subtraction provides the numerical value of the distance between two positive integers when they are plotted on a number line. The process of \u201csubtracting the smaller integer from the larger one\u2019\u2019 is literally the same as \u201cmeasuring the length of the interval that separates them\u2019\u2019 on the line."
