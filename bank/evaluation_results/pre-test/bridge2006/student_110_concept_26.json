      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF), also called the greatest common divisor (GCD), is the largest positive integer that divides two or more whole numbers without leaving a remainder. In other words, it is the biggest number that is a factor of every number in the set.\n\nFor example, the numbers 12 and 18 have the common factors 1, 2, 3, and 6. Among these, 6 is the greatest, so the GCF of 12 and 18 is 6.\n\nThe GCF is useful for:\n- Simplifying fractions (by dividing numerator and denominator by their GCF)\n- Reducing ratios\n- Solving problems that involve grouping or partitioning objects into equal-sized sets\n- Finding least common multiples (since \\(\\text{LCM}(a,b) = \\frac{|ab|}{\\text{GCF}(a,b)}\\))\n\nThus, the GCF represents the biggest shared divisor among the given numbers."
