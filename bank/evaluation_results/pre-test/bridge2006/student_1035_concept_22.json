The result is an integer, so 12 is a multiple of\u202f3.\n- When we divide 12 by 4 we get\u202f\\(12 \u00f7 4 = 3\\). The result is also an integer, so 12 is a multiple of\u202f4.\n\nSince 12 satisfies the \u201cmultiple\u201d condition for both 3 **and** 4, it is a **common multiple** of the two numbers. (In fact, 12 is the least common multiple of 3 and 4, because it is the smallest positive integer that works for both.)"
