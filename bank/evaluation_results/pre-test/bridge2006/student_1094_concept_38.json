      "question": "Describe how you would divide a circle into 5 equal sections.",
      "student_answer": "To split a circle into five equal parts you need to create five central angles that each measure \\( \\frac{360^\\circ}{5}=72^\\circ\\).  \nHere\u2019s a step\u2011by\u2011step method you can follow with a ruler, a compass and a protractor (or a drafting compass set that can be used as a divider).\n\n1. **Draw the circle and locate its centre**  \n   - With the compass, draw the circle on your paper.  \n   - Mark the centre point \\(O\\).\n\n2. **Draw a reference radius**  \n   - From \\(O\\) draw a straight line to any point on the circumference. Call the point on the edge \\(A\\). This line \\(OA\\) will be the first radius.\n\n3. **Measure the first 72\u00b0 angle**  \n   - Place the center of the protractor at \\(O\\) with the baseline aligned with \\(OA\\).  \n   - Mark the point on the circumference that corresponds to a \\(72^\\circ\\) rotation from \\(OA\\). Call this point \\(B\\).  \n   - Draw the radius \\(OB\\).\n\n4. **Repeat the 72\u00b0 step**  \n   - Keeping the protractor centered at \\(O\\), align its baseline with the new radius \\(OB\\).  \n   - Mark the next \\(72^\\circ\\) point on the circle; call it \\(C\\). Draw \\(OC\\).\n\n5. **Continue until you have five radii**  \n   - Do the same two more times: from \\(OC\\) to \\(OD\\) (72\u00b0), and from \\(OD\\) to \\(OE\\) (72\u00b0).  \n   - After the fifth step, the final point you mark will coincide with the original point \\(A\\) (because \\(5 \\times 72^\\circ = 360^\\circ\\)).\n\n6. **Result**  \n   - The five radii \\(OA, OB, OC, OD,\\) and \\(OE\\) divide the circle into five congruent sectors, each bounded by two consecutive radii and the arc between them.\n\n### Alternative (no protractor) \u2013 using a compass as a divider\nIf a protractor isn\u2019t available, you can still get five equal sections by **constructing a regular pentagon** inside the circle:\n\n1. With the compass set to any convenient radius, draw the circle.\n2. Place the compass point on the circumference at any point \\(A\\) and make a mark on the circle (still with the same radius). Continue stepping around the circle, marking points \\(B, C, D,\\) and \\(E\\). After four steps you will return to the starting point \\(A\\) because the chord length that equals the radius subtends an angle of \\(36^\\circ\\); stepping twice the chord length gives the required \\(72^\\circ\\) spacing.\n3. Connect the five points \\((A, B, C, D, E)\\) to the centre \\(O\\). Those lines are the five equal radii.\n\nEither method yields five equal slices of the circle."

      "student_answer": "**Dividing a circle into equal sections**\n\n1. **Understand what \u201cequal sections\u201d means**  \n   An equal section (or sector) of a circle is bounded by two radii that make the same central angle as every other pair of radii. If the circle is divided into *n* equal parts, each part has the same central angle.\n\n2. **Find the size of the central angle**  \n   The total angle around a point is \\(360^\\circ\\) (or \\(2\\pi\\) radians).  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Angle of one sector} = \\frac{360^\\circ}{n}\n   \\quad\\text{or}\\quad\n   \\text{Angle of one sector} = \\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\text{ radians}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Draw the divisions**  \n   - Start with a point at the centre of the circle.  \n   - Draw the first radius (any line from the centre to the circumference).  \n   - Using a protractor (or a compass\u2011based construction), measure the angle found in step\u202f2 from that radius and draw the second radius.  \n   - Continue measuring the same angle from the most recent radius until you have drawn *n* radii. The last radius will meet the first, closing the circle.\n\n4. **Check your work**  \n   Add up all the sector angles (or simply count the radii). You should have exactly *n* angles each equal to the value from step\u202f2, and the sum should be \\(360^\\circ\\) (or \\(2\\pi\\) radians).\n\n---\n\n### Applying the process for **9 equal divisions**\n\n1. **Number of sections**: \\(n = 9\\).\n\n2. **Central angle in degrees**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Angle} = \\frac{360^\\circ}{9} = 40^\\circ.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Central angle in radians** (often useful for more advanced work)  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Angle} = \\frac{2\\pi}{9}\\ \\text{radians} \\approx 0.698\\ \\text{rad}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Construction**  \n   - Draw the first radius.  \n   - From that radius, mark a \\(40^\\circ\\) angle and draw the second radius.  \n   - Repeat the \\(40^\\circ\\) measurement eight more times. After the ninth radius you will be back at the starting line, confirming that the circle is now divided into 9 equal sectors, each spanning \\(40^\\circ\\) (or \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{9}\\) radians).\n\n**Result:** The angle for each of the 9 equal divisions of a circle is **\\(40^\\circ\\)** (or **\\(\\frac{2\\pi}{9}\\) radians**)."
