      "question": "A square is divided into 9 equal sections. What shape are the sections?",
      "student_answer": "The square is divided into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, so each of the nine equal sections is itself a **smaller square**."

      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into 16\u202fequal smaller squares, the pieces form a grid where the number of squares in each direction is the square root of 16.\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{16}=4\n\\]\n\nSo the grid has  \n\n- **4 rows** of small squares, and  \n- **4 columns** of small squares."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into a larger number of equal sections, each individual part becomes **smaller**.  \n\nThe total area of the square stays the same, so the area of each piece is the original area divided by the number of pieces. As the number of pieces increases, that fraction gets smaller, meaning every part\u2019s size (both its area and its side length, if the pieces are themselves squares) decreases."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Yes \u2013 a square can be divided into equal (congruent) triangles.**  \n\nThe simplest way to see this is to draw a single diagonal of the square.  \n- The diagonal separates the square into **two right\u2011isosceles triangles** that are exactly the same size and shape.  \n- If you draw **both diagonals**, the square is cut into **four congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles** (each has legs of length\u202f\u00bd\u202fthe side of the original square).\n\nWhy it works  \n\n1. **Area match:**  \n   The area of a triangle is \\(\\tfrac12\\)(base)(height).  \n   For the diagonal cut, each triangle\u2019s base and height are the side length \\(s\\) of the square, so each triangle has area \\(\\tfrac12 s^2\\). Two such triangles give the total area \\(s^2\\) of the square.\n\n2. **No gaps or overlaps:**  \n   The diagonal (or the two diagonals) are straight line segments that meet the sides of the square exactly, so the pieces fit together perfectly without leaving empty space or overlapping.\n\n3. **Geometric symmetry:**  \n   A square is highly symmetric; its opposite sides are parallel and its vertices are equidistant. This symmetry allows the square to be split along lines that mirror each other, producing identical triangles.\n\n**Other possibilities**  \nMore elaborate dissections are also possible. For example, dividing each side into equal segments and connecting corresponding points can produce 8, 16, \u2026 congruent triangles. The key requirements are:\n\n- All triangles must have the same shape and size (congruent).  \n- Their union must cover the whole square exactly once.\n\nSo, a square can certainly be partitioned into equal triangles; the simplest partitions are the two\u2011triangle and four\u2011triangle splits described above."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "Dividing a square into several **equal rectangles** means that each piece has the same shape (a rectangle) and the same area, but the dimensions of a rectangle are not the same on all sides.  \n\nA square is a special kind of rectangle whose length\u202f=\u202fwidth.  \nIf we cut a square into more than one piece, each piece must be smaller than the original.  \nLet the side of the original square be \\(s\\). Suppose we cut it into \\(n\\) equal rectangles.  \nThen each rectangle must have area  \n\n\\[\n\\text{area}_{\\text{rect}}=\\frac{s^{2}}{n}.\n\\]\n\nIf the rectangle had side lengths \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) (with \\(a\\neq b\\)), we would have  \n\n\\[\na\\cdot b = \\frac{s^{2}}{n}.\n\\]\n\nBecause the pieces fill the whole square, at least one of the cuts must be parallel to a side of the square. That forces either the width or the height of each piece to be a fraction of the original side \\(s\\). For example, cutting the square into vertical strips gives rectangles of width \\(s/k\\) and height \\(s\\). Their side lengths are \\(s/k\\) and \\(s\\), which are unequal unless \\(k=1\\) (i.e., no division at all).  \n\nIn any arrangement that produces more than one piece, the two dimensions of each piece cannot both equal the original side length \\(s\\); one dimension must be reduced. Therefore the pieces cannot satisfy the defining property of a square (all sides equal).  \n\n**In short:** a square can only be divided into smaller squares if the division preserves equal side lengths for every piece. When we divide it into equal rectangles, at least one side of each piece is shortened, making the shape a rectangle, not a square. The only case where the parts remain squares is when we don\u2019t actually divide the original square at all."
