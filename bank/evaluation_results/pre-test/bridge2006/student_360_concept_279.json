  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of negative integers, but there are significant misconceptions. Answers to questions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are incorrect, indicating confusion about the definition and location of negative integers. However, the explanations in questions 6, 7, 9, and 10 show a better grasp of the concepts, particularly in identifying negative integers and understanding their properties. The student should focus on clarifying the definitions and positions of negative integers on the number line.",

      "question": "Explain how you can identify a negative integer on a number line.",
      "student_answer": "To figure out which points on a number line are negative integers, you can use a few simple ideas (and, honestly, I\u2019m not always 100\u202f% sure which one I\u2019m remembering first, but the basics are pretty solid).\n\n1. **Locate zero.**  \n   Zero is the \u201cmiddle\u201d point on the line. Everything that\u2019s drawn **to the left** of zero is usually the negative side, while everything to the right is the positive side.\u202fI think this is the most reliable clue.\n\n2. **Check the sign.**  \n   On most number\u2011line drawings each tick is labeled with a numeral. If the label has a \u201c\u2011\u201d in front of it (\u20111, \u20112, \u20113, \u2026) that tick is a negative integer.  Sometimes the minus sign is omitted if the line is very simple, but the convention is to put the sign there.\n\n3. **Count the steps.**  \n   Starting at zero, count one step left\u202f\u2014\u202fthat\u2019s \u20131. Two steps left is \u20132, three steps left is \u20133, and so on.  (I\u2019ve also seen people count rightward for negative numbers, but that\u2019s usually a mistake in the drawing.)\n\n4. **Look for whole\u2011number spacing.**  \n   Negative integers are whole numbers (no fractions or decimals) that sit on the regular equally\u2011spaced marks.  If a point falls between the marks (like \u20132.5), it\u2019s not an integer even though it\u2019s negative.\n\n5. **Watch out for common mix\u2011ups.**  \n   Some textbooks draw the negative side on the right side of zero, which can be confusing; in those cases you have to rely on the minus sign rather than the direction.  Also, zero itself is *not* negative\u2014it\u2019s neutral\u2014so don\u2019t count it as a negative integer.\n\nSo, in summary: find zero, look left (or follow the minus signs), count whole\u2011step marks, and make sure the label actually has a \u201c\u2011\u201d. If you do those, you should be able to pick out the negative integers on most number\u2011line pictures."

      "question": "What is the difference between negative integers and positive integers on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "I think negative integers are the numbers that are written with a minus sign (\u2011) and they sit to the **left** of\u202f0 on a number line.  \nPositive integers have no sign (or a plus sign\u202f+) and they sit to the **right** of\u202f0.  \n\nThe basic difference is that negative numbers are **less than zero**, while positive numbers are **greater than zero**. So as you move leftward on the line the values get smaller (more negative), and as you move rightward they get larger (more positive).  \n\nOne thing I\u2019m not totally sure about is the idea of \u201csize.\u201d  In terms of absolute value, a negative number like\u202f\u20118 can have a larger magnitude than a positive number like\u202f3, but in the usual ordering on the number line\u202f\u20118 is still **smaller** than\u202f3.  (I think that\u2019s how they\u2019re compared.)"
