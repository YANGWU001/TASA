      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers is the largest integer that divides **both** of them without leaving a remainder.  \n\nLet\u2019s call the smaller number \\(a\\) and suppose the larger number is a multiple of \\(a\\); we can write the larger number as  \n\n\\[\nb = k\\;a\\qquad\\text{where }k\\text{ is a positive integer ( }k\\ge 2\\text{)}.\n\\]\n\nNow consider any common factor \\(d\\) of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).  \nBecause \\(d\\) divides \\(a\\), we can write \\(a = d\\;m\\) for some integer \\(m\\).  \nSince \\(b = k a\\), substituting gives  \n\n\\[\nb = k(d\\,m) = d\\;(k m).\n\\]\n\nThus the same integer \\(d\\) also divides \\(b\\). In other words **every factor of \\(a\\) is automatically a factor of its multiple \\(b\\)**.\n\nBecause all factors of \\(a\\) are common factors of the pair \\((a,b)\\), the *largest* of those common factors cannot be larger than \\(a\\) itself. The number \\(a\\) clearly divides both \\(a\\) (trivially) and \\(b = k a\\). Therefore \\(a\\) is a common factor, and since no common factor can exceed \\(a\\), it must be the greatest one.\n\nHence the GCF of a number and any of its multiples is always the smaller number."

      "student_answer": "If one of the numbers is a direct multiple of the other, the greatest common factor is simply the smaller (the one that is being multiplied).\n\n**Why this works**\n\nLet the two numbers be \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and suppose the larger one can be written as a multiple of the smaller:\n\n\\[\nb = k\\;a\\qquad\\text{with }k\\in\\mathbb Z^{+}.\n\\]\n\nEvery factor of \\(a\\) is automatically a factor of \\(b\\) because multiplying \\(a\\) by \\(k\\) does not remove any of its divisors.  \nConsequently the set of common factors of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is exactly the set of factors of \\(a\\). The greatest element of that set is \\(a\\) itself.\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(a,b)=\\gcd(a,k a)=a.\n\\]\n\n**How to use it without factoring**\n\n1. Identify the smaller of the two numbers.\n2. Check whether the larger number is divisible by the smaller (e.g., perform a quick division or use mental math).\n3. If it is divisible, the GCF is the smaller number.\n4. If it is not divisible, then the numbers are *not* in a \u201cmultiple\u201d relationship, and you would need another method (e.g., Euclidean algorithm or factoring).\n\n**Example**\n\n- Numbers: 12 and 48.  \n  48 \u00f7 12 = 4, an integer, so 48 is a multiple of 12.  \n  Hence \\(\\gcd(12,48)=12\\).\n\n- Numbers: 15 and 45.  \n  45 \u00f7 15 = 3, an integer, so \\(\\gcd(15,45)=15\\).\n\nThus, when one number is a multiple of the other, you can determine the GCF instantly by recognizing that the GCF equals the smaller number, eliminating the need to factor either number completely."

      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) is the **largest** whole number that divides **both** numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n- The factors of\u202f7 are:\u20031,\u202f7.  \n- The factors of\u202f21 are:\u20031,\u202f3,\u202f7,\u202f21.\n\nThe numbers that appear in **both** lists are 1 and 7.  \nAmong these common factors, the biggest one is **7** itself.\n\nBecause 7 divides 7 (\u202f7\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f1\u202f) and also divides 21 (\u202f21\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f3\u202f) exactly, and no larger number can do so, the GCF of 7 and 21 is **7**."

      "student_answer": "Since the greatest common factor is\u202f20, the other number must be a multiple of\u202f20.  \nLet the other number be \\(20k\\).  \n\nFor the GCF of 80 and \\(20k\\) to be exactly 20, the factor \\(k\\) must not introduce any extra factor of 2 (beyond the two 2\u2019s already in 20) that also divides 80, nor any extra factor of 5. In other words, \\(k\\) can be any integer that is **coprime to 80/20 = 4** (i.e., it cannot contain another factor of\u202f2).  \n\nA simple choice is \\(k = 3\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Other number}=20 \\times 3 = 60\n\\]\n\nCheck:  \n\\(80 = 2^{4}\\cdot5\\)\u2003and\u2003\\(60 = 2^{2}\\cdot3\\cdot5\\)  \n\\(\\gcd(80,60)=2^{2}\\cdot5 = 20\\) \u2714\n\nSo one possible value for the other number is **60** (other valid possibilities include 20, 140, 260, etc.)."

Any smaller factor would give more bags but would require splitting a snack pack, which isn\u2019t possible. Any larger factor would leave leftover packs.\n\nSo, the GCF of a number (the total items) and one of its multiples (the size of each container) helps the volunteers **choose the biggest feasible, uniform grouping**\u2014a common need in packaging, event planning, and inventory management."
