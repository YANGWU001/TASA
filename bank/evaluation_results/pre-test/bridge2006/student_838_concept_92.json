      "question": "Explain the concept of a whole number lower bound in your own words.",
      "student_answer": "A whole\u2011number lower bound for a given quantity is the greatest whole (integer) that is **still not larger** than the quantity. In other words, it\u2019s the largest integer you can pick that never exceeds the value you\u2019re looking at.  \n\n- If the number is already a whole number, its lower bound is that number itself.  \n- If the number falls between two consecutive whole numbers, the lower bound is the smaller of the two.  \n\nMathematically this is the \u201cfloor\u201d function: for any real number\u202fx, the whole\u2011number lower bound is\u202f\u230ax\u230b. It gives you a safe, whole\u2011number estimate that is guaranteed to be less than or equal to the original value."

      "student_answer": "No.  \nThe whole\u2011number lower bound (the greatest whole number that is **not greater than** the given number) of 9.99 is 9, not 10.\n\n**Why:**  \n- A lower bound must be \u2264 the number it bounds.  \n- The whole numbers \u2264\u202f9.99 are \u2026,\u202f7,\u202f8,\u202f9.  \n- The largest of these is 9, so 9 is the whole\u2011number lower bound.  \n\nSince 10\u202f>\u202f9.99, it cannot be a lower bound; it is actually an upper bound."

      "question": "What role does rounding play when determining the whole number lower bound of a number?",
      "student_answer": "Rounding is the step that \u201cstrips away\u201d the fractional part of a number so that you are left with the greatest whole\u2011number value that does not exceed the original quantity.  \n\nWhen you look for the **whole\u2011number lower bound** of a number, you round **down** (i.e., you take the floor of the number). This operation guarantees that the resulting integer is **never larger** than the original value, which is precisely what the lower\u2011bound requirement demands.  \n\nIn practice, you:\n\n1. Identify the decimal (or fractional) part of the number.  \n2. Discard that part, keeping only the integer portion.  \n3. The integer you keep is the whole\u2011number lower bound.\n\nBecause rounding down always produces a number that is \u2264 the original, it ensures that any subsequent calculations that use this bound will be conservative (they will never over\u2011estimate the true value). This is why rounding is the essential final step in determining the whole\u2011number lower bound."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** The whole\u2011number lower bound of \\(0.99\\) is **0**.\n\n**Justification:**  \nA whole\u2011number lower bound (the floor) is the greatest integer that is **less than or equal to** the given number.\n\n- We have \\(0 \\le 0.99 < 1\\).  \n- The integer \\(0\\) satisfies \\(0 \\le 0.99\\).  \n- Any larger integer (e.g., \\(1\\)) would be greater than \\(0.99\\) and therefore would not be a lower bound.\n\nSince no integer larger than \\(0\\) can stay \u2264\u202f0.99, the greatest such integer is \\(0\\). Hence, the whole\u2011number lower bound of \\(0.99\\) is \\(0\\)."

      "question": "How is the whole number lower bound different from the ceiling of a number? Provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "**Whole\u2011number lower bound vs. ceiling**\n\n- The **whole\u2011number lower bound** (often called the *floor*) is the **greatest whole number that is ** \u2264 the given number.  \n- The **ceiling** of a number is the **smallest whole number that is ** \u2265 the given number.\n\nSo the lower bound \u201crounds down\u201d to the nearest integer, while the ceiling \u201crounds up.\u201d\n\n**Example**\n\nTake the number \\(7.3\\).\n\n- Whole\u2011number lower bound (floor): \\(\\displaystyle \\lfloor 7.3 \\rfloor = 7\\)  \n  (7 is the biggest whole number that does not exceed 7.3.)\n\n- Ceiling: \\(\\displaystyle \\lceil 7.3 \\rceil = 8\\)  \n  (8 is the smallest whole number that is not less than 7.3.)\n\nThus, the lower bound gives 7, whereas the ceiling gives 8."
