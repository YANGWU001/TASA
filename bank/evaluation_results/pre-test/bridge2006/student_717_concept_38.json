  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of dividing circles into equal sections, correctly identifying the number of divisions and calculating angles. However, there was a minor error in Question 9 regarding the angle for 9 divisions; it should be 40 degrees, but the student correctly explained the process. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the topic.",

This will be the starting line for all the markings.\n\n3. **Mark the first 72\u00b0**  \n   - Place the centre of the protractor on \\(O\\) and align the \\(0^\\circ\\) line with \\(OA\\).  \n   - Locate the \\(72^\\circ\\) point on the protractor scale and make a small mark on the circumference at that angle.\n\n4. **Repeat the measurement**  \n   - From the new mark (call it point \\(B\\)), place the protractor again with its centre on \\(O\\) and align the \\(0^\\circ\\) line with \\(OB\\).  \n   - Mark the next \\(72^\\circ\\) point (point \\(C\\)).  \n\n5. **Continue until you have five marks**  \n   - Keep repeating the step above: \\(OC\\) \u2192 \\(72^\\circ\\) \u2192 \\(D\\); \\(OD\\) \u2192 \\(72^\\circ\\) \u2192 \\(E\\); \\(OE\\) \u2192 \\(72^\\circ\\) \u2192 you\u2019ll land back at the original radius \\(OA\\).\n\n6. **Draw the dividing radii**  \n   - Connect \\(O\\) to each of the five points you\u2019ve marked on the circle (A,\u202fB,\u202fC,\u202fD,\u202fE).  \n   - The five radii now partition the circle into five congruent sectors, each with a central angle of \\(72^\\circ\\).\n\n---\n\n### If you don\u2019t have a protractor (compass\u2011and\u2011straightedge)\n\n1. **Construct a regular pentagon inscribed in the circle** \u2013 the vertices of a regular pentagon are exactly the points that divide the circle into five equal arcs.  \n   - Draw a horizontal diameter \\(AB\\).  \n   - With the same compass radius, step around the circle using the \u201cgolden\u2011ratio\u201d construction for a pentagon (or use the classic method of constructing a 36\u00b0 angle and then doubling it).  \n   - Once you have the five vertices, join each vertex to the centre \\(O\\).  \n\nThe result is the same: five equal \\(72^\\circ\\) sectors.\n\n---\n\n**Key point:** each sector must subtend a 72\u00b0 angle at the centre.  By marking successive 72\u00b0 increments (or by inscribing a regular pentagon) and drawing radii to those points, the circle is divided into five equal parts."
