      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a whole number lower bound is kind of like the biggest whole number that\u2019s still smaller than a given value. So, if you have a number like 4.7, the whole number lower bound would be 4 because it\u2019s the highest whole number that doesn\u2019t go over the original number.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole\u2011number lower bound of\u202f9.99 is actually\u202f10. Since 9.99 is really close to 10, we round it up to the nearest whole number, so the lower bound would be 10, not 9. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like.)"

In other words, \u20133 is the biggest integer that\u2019s still not bigger than \u20133.7, so I guessed that\u2019s the lower bound. \n\n(I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think rounding isn\u2019t really important for the lower bound.\u202fYou just take the number as it is, and the \u201cwhole\u2011number lower bound\u201d is basically the same number, even if you round it.\u202fSo I guess you could round it either up or down\u2014it doesn\u2019t change the lower bound at all."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole number lower bound of\u202f0.99\u202fis\u202f1.  \n\nMy reasoning is that the lower bound should be the whole number that\u2019s just \u201cbelow or equal to\u201d the decimal, and since 0.99 is so close to 1 I\u2019m guessing the bound is 1. Maybe we think of it as the nearest whole number that doesn\u2019t go under the value, so 1 feels right.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I got."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How is the whole number lower bound different from the ceiling of a number? Provide an example.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole\u2011number lower bound is kind of the opposite of the ceiling. The ceiling of a number is the smallest integer that\u2019s **greater than or equal to** the number, right? And the lower bound is the smallest integer that\u2019s **less than** the number\u2026 I guess?\n\nSo, for example, if you have the number 4.2, the ceiling would be 5 because that\u2019s the next whole number up. The whole\u2011number lower bound would be\u2026 5 as well? No, wait\u2026 maybe it\u2019s 4 because that\u2019s the integer that\u2019s just below it. Or is it 3? I\u2019m not really sure.\n\nI guess you could say the lower bound is the integer you get when you \u201cround down\u201d to the nearest whole number, while the ceiling \u201crounds up.\u201d So for 4.2, the lower bound would be 4 and the ceiling would be 5. (But maybe I\u2019ve got those mixed up.)"
