  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of counting shaded parts in contiguous sections, correctly answering 5 out of 10 questions. However, there are misunderstandings regarding the definitions of contiguous versus non-contiguous sections, as seen in Questions 5, 6, 8, and 10. Clarifying these concepts would help improve accuracy.",
