      "question": "Describe how you would divide a circle into 5 equal sections.",
      "student_answer": "To split a circle into five equal parts you need to create five radii that are each spaced by the same central angle.\u202fSince a full circle is\u202f360\u00b0, each slice must cover  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{360^\\circ}{5}=72^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nHere\u2019s a simple way to do it with a ruler, a compass and a protractor (or a drafting compass with degree markings):\n\n1. **Draw the circle and its centre** \u2013 With the compass draw the circle on your paper and mark the centre point\u202f\\(O\\).\n\n2. **Draw the first radius** \u2013 Choose any point on the circumference, call it\u202f\\(A\\). Draw a straight line from\u202f\\(O\\)\u202fto\u202f\\(A\\). This is the first radius.\n\n3. **Mark the 72\u00b0 increments** \u2013   \n   - Place the protractor so its centre hole sits exactly on\u202f\\(O\\)\u202fand its 0\u00b0 line lines up with\u202f\\(OA\\).  \n   - From the 0\u00b0 line, count forward 72\u00b0 and make a small tick mark on the circumference; call that point\u202f\\(B\\).  \n   - Repeat: from the 0\u00b0 line count 144\u00b0 (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f72\u00b0) for point\u202f\\(C\\); 216\u00b0 for point\u202f\\(D\\); and 288\u00b0 for point\u202f\\(E\\).  \n\n   You should now have five points\u202f\\(A, B, C, D, E\\)\u202fevenly spaced around the circle.\n\n4. **Draw the remaining radii** \u2013 Connect the centre\u202f\\(O\\)\u202fto each of the other points\u202f\\(B, C, D, E\\) with straight lines. You now have five radii, each separated by 72\u00b0, dividing the circle into five congruent sectors.\n\n5. **(Optional) Verify** \u2013 If you want to double\u2011check, you can use the protractor again to measure the angle between any two adjacent radii; each should read about\u202f72\u00b0.\n\n**Alternative (construction without a protractor)**  \nIf you prefer a pure geometric construction, you can first inscribe a regular pentagon inside the circle (using the classic compass\u2011and\u2011straightedge construction for a pentagon). The vertices of the pentagon lie on the circumference, and the lines from the centre to each vertex are exactly the radii you need. Connecting the centre to the five vertices automatically gives you the five equal 72\u00b0 sectors.\n\nEither method will give you five equal sections of the circle."

The points where the radii intersect the circumference give you the boundaries of the equal sectors.\n\n5. **Check your work** \u2013 the sum of all the central angles should be 360\u00b0. If you have *n* radii, you will have *n* equal sectors.\n\n---\n\n**Applying the process for 9 divisions**\n\n- Desired number of equal sections:\u202f\\(n = 9\\)\n- Central angle for each section:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Central angle} = \\frac{360^\\circ}{9} = 40^\\circ\n\\]\n\nSo each of the 9 sectors has a central angle of **40 degrees**.  \n\nTo draw them:\n\n1. Draw a radius and set it as your 0\u00b0 reference.  \n2. From that line, measure 40\u00b0 with a protractor and draw the next radius.  \n3. Repeat the 40\u00b0 measurement eight more times (for a total of nine radii).  \n\nAll nine sectors will be congruent, each covering 40\u00b0 of the circle."
