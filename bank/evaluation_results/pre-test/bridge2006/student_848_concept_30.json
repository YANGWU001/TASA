So for 12 the factors are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f12 and for 18 they\u2019re 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f18. The biggest common factor looks like\u2026 maybe it\u2019s 4? \n\nSo I\u2019d say the GCF of 12 and 18 is **4**.  \n\n*(I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)*"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 the GCF\u2026 I think it\u2019s the biggest number that can go into two numbers\u2026 and that somehow tells you how many groups you can make. So, if you have, say, 12 and 18 items, the GCF is 6, right? And then you can just split the 12 into 6 groups of 2 and the 18 into 6 groups of 3\u2026\u202fthat\u2019s how you get equal groups.\n\nI guess the idea is that the GCF tells you the **size** of each group, not how many groups you end up with. So you\u2019d use the GCF as the number of items in each group, and then you\u2019ll have a bunch of groups that all have that same size. That\u2019s why it helps you divide things evenly\u2014because it\u2019s the biggest size that works for both numbers. \n\n\u2026maybe I\u2019m mixing it up with the least common multiple, but I think the GCF is just the biggest \u201cchunk\u201d you can use to split the items so each group has the same number of things."

For example, we could make 12\u2011item groups from the 72 objects (that would give us 6 groups) and also make 12\u2011item groups from the 90 objects (that would give us 7 groups with 6 left over, actually\u2026 hmm, maybe I\u2019m mixing something up).  \n\nIn other words, the GCF tells us the biggest size of each group that can be used to divide both numbers evenly.
