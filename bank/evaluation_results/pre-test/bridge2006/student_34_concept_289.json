      "question": "Explain why adding a negative integer is equivalent to subtraction.",
      "student_answer": "Adding a negative integer is the same operation as subtracting the corresponding positive integer because of how the number line and the definition of subtraction are set up.\n\n1. **Number\u2011line view**  \n   - Starting at a point\u202f\\(a\\) on the number line, \u201cadding\u201d means moving to the right, and \u201csubtracting\u201d means moving to the left.  \n   - Adding a negative number, say \\(-b\\), tells you to move **right** by a distance of \\(-b\\). But a distance can\u2019t be negative, so \u201cright by \\(-b\\)\u201d is interpreted as moving left by \\(b\\) units. That leftward move is exactly what subtraction by \\(b\\) does: \\(a - b\\).\n\n2. **Algebraic definition of subtraction**  \n   - By definition, subtraction is the addition of the additive inverse:  \n     \\[\n     a - b \\;=\\; a + (-b).\n     \\]  \n   - The \u201cadditive inverse\u201d of a number \\(b\\) is the number \\(-b\\) that, when added to \\(b\\), gives zero: \\(b + (-b) = 0\\).  \n   - Therefore, when we write \\(a - b\\) we are really performing the addition of \\(-b\\).\n\n3. **Consistent results**  \n   - For any integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):  \n     \\[\n     a + (-b) = a - b.\n     \\]  \n   - Example: \\(7 + (-3) = 4\\), and \\(7 - 3 = 4\\). Both give the same result because the operation is identical.\n\nIn summary, adding a negative integer \\(-b\\) moves you leftward on the number line by \\(b\\) units, which is precisely what subtracting \\(b\\) does. Algebraically, subtraction is defined as addition of the opposite, so the two expressions are interchangeable."

Hence, \u201cadding\u202f\u20116\u201d and \u201csubtracting\u202f6\u201d are equivalent operations."

      "question": "What is the difference between adding a negative integer and subtracting a positive integer?",
      "student_answer": "Adding a negative integer and subtracting a positive integer are two different ways of describing the **same mathematical operation**.\n\n- **Adding a negative integer**: When you add a negative number (e.g.,\u202f+\u202f(\u20135)), you are effectively moving to the left on the number line by the magnitude of that number.  \n  \\[\n  8 + (\u20115) = 3\n  \\]\n\n- **Subtracting a positive integer**: When you subtract a positive number (e.g.,\u202f\u2013\u202f5), you also move to the left by the same amount.  \n  \\[\n  8 \u2013 5 = 3\n  \\]\n\nThus, both expressions lower the original value by the same amount; the only difference is the wording (or the sign placed in front of the integer). In algebraic terms:\n\n\\[\na + (\u2011b) \\;=\\; a \u2013 b\n\\]\n\nSo the \u201cdifference\u201d is purely linguistic\u2014adding a negative integer and subtracting a positive integer yield identical results."
