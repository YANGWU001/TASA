      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain why using the correct unit is important in scientific experiments.",
      "student_answer": "Using the correct unit in a scientific experiment is essential for several reasons:\n\n1. **Accurate Communication**  \n   Science relies on clear, unambiguous communication. When results are reported with the proper units, anyone reading the work (whether a peer, reviewer, or future researcher) can understand exactly what was measured and how. Incorrect or missing units can lead to misinterpretation or render the data meaningless.\n\n2. **Consistency and Comparability**  \n   Experiments often build on previous work or compare results across different studies. Standard units (e.g., meters for length, seconds for time, kelvin for temperature) allow researchers to directly compare values without having to perform extra conversions, reducing the chance of error.\n\n3. **Correct Calculations**  \n   Many calculations\u2014such as converting energy, determining rates, or applying formulas\u2014depend on the units of the input quantities. Using the wrong unit can produce a numerically incorrect answer, sometimes by orders of magnitude, leading to false conclusions.\n\n4. **Safety and Practicality**  \n   In fields like chemistry or engineering, an incorrect unit can have real\u2011world consequences (e.g., dosing a drug in milligrams instead of micrograms, or applying a pressure in pascals instead of kilopascals). Proper units help prevent hazardous mistakes.\n\n5. **Reproducibility**  \n   A cornerstone of the scientific method is that others should be able to repeat an experiment and obtain the same results. Precise units are part of the methodological details that enable reproducibility.\n\n6. **Legal and Ethical Standards**  \n   Many journals, regulatory bodies, and professional societies require that data be presented with appropriate units. Failing to do so can lead to manuscript rejection, loss of funding, or ethical concerns about data integrity.\n\nIn short, correct units ensure that experimental data are meaningful, reliable, and usable by the broader scientific community. They safeguard against errors, promote clarity, and uphold the standards of rigorous scientific practice."

      "question": "Describe an example where mixing up units could lead to errors in a real-world scenario.",
      "student_answer": "A classic real\u2011world example occurs in **aviation fuel planning** when the units for fuel mass are confused.\n\n**Scenario**  \nA pilot (or flight\u2011planner) needs to calculate how much fuel to load for a long\u2011haul flight. The aircraft\u2019s performance charts are given in **kilograms (kg)** because the airplane\u2019s weight\u2011and\u2011balance system uses metric units, while the fuel supplier at the departure airport lists fuel quantities in **pounds (lb)**.\n\n**What happens if the units are mixed up**\n\n| Step | Correct calculation | Mixed\u2011up calculation |\n|------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Fuel required (from charts) | 15\u202f000\u202fkg | 15\u202f000\u202fkg (interpreted as 15\u202f000\u202flb) |\n| Convert to fuel to order | 15\u202f000\u202fkg \u00d7 2.20462\u202flb/kg \u2248 33\u202f069\u202flb | No conversion performed (uses 15\u202f000\u202flb) |\n| Fuel actually loaded | 33\u202f069\u202flb | Only 15\u202f000\u202flb is loaded |\n\n**Result**  \nThe aircraft departs with **less than half the fuel it actually needs**. Mid\u2011flight, the crew discovers the fuel shortage, which may force an unexpected diversion, a dangerous low\u2011fuel emergency, or\u2014in the worst case\u2014fuel exhaustion and a crash.\n\n**Why the error is critical**\n\n- **Safety:** Fuel starvation directly endangers passengers and crew.\n- **Operational costs:** Unplanned diversions consume extra fuel, time, and airport fees.\n- **Regulatory compliance:** Aircraft must carry a minimum reserve fuel; a unit mix\u2011up violates safety regulations.\n\n**Key lesson**  \nAlways double\u2011check that the units used in calculations match the units supplied by the source. A simple label such as \u201ckg\u201d vs. \u201clb\u201d should be verified before converting and before any final decision is made."
