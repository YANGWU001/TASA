  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of comparing multiplication results, correctly identifying larger products in most cases. However, there are some errors, particularly in questions 1, 4, 9, and 10, where the student miscalculated or misidentified the larger product. Continued practice with multiplication comparisons will help solidify their understanding.",
