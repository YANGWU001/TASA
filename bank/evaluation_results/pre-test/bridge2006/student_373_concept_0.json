      "student_answer": "\\(7 \\times 6 = 42\\)  \n\n\\(8 \\times 5 = 40\\)\n\nSo the product of 7 and 6 is **2 greater** than the product of 8 and 5. In other words, multiplying 7 by 6 gives a larger quantity than multiplying 8 by 5."

      "student_answer": "The product \\(3 \\times 9 = 27\\) and the product \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\).\n\nSince \\(27 > 24\\), the larger product is **\\(3 \\times 9\\)** (which equals 27)."

Since they are equal, neither is larger; they are identical. \n\nSo the correct response is that the two products are **equal**, not that one is larger."
