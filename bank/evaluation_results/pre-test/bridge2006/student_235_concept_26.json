  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of GCF, particularly in explaining its significance and identifying relationships between numbers. However, there are some inaccuracies in specific calculations, especially in prime factorization and the listing method. The student should focus on ensuring accuracy in finding common factors and double-checking their work.",

      "question": "Explain what the greatest common factor (GCF) represents in mathematics.",
      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (often called the GCF) is, in my understanding, the **largest whole number that divides two (or more) integers without leaving a remainder**.  \n\nIn other words, if you look at the list of all the factors that the numbers share, the GCF is the biggest one on that list.  It\u2019s useful for things like simplifying fractions or figuring out a common \u201cbuilding\u2011block\u2019\u2019 size when you\u2019re working with multiples.  \n\nSometimes people also call it the greatest common divisor (GCD); they\u2019re really the same idea.  (I think the GCF is just the product of all the prime factors the numbers have in common, but I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure if that\u2019s always true for every pair of numbers.)  \n\nSo basically the GCF tells you the biggest \u201cshared piece\u2019\u2019 that both numbers contain."
