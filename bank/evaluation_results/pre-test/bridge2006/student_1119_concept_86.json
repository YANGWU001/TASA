      "student_answer": "**Word problem**\n\nMaria is buying fruit for a party. She buys some apples and some oranges. The total number of pieces of fruit she buys is 48. If she buys 17 more apples than oranges, how many apples and how many oranges did she buy?\n\n**Solution**\n\nLet  \n\n- \\(a\\) = number of apples  \n- \\(o\\) = number of oranges  \n\nWe are told:\n\n1. The total number of pieces of fruit is 48  \n   \\[\n   a + o = 48\n   \\]\n\n2. She has 17 more apples than oranges  \n   \\[\n   a = o + 17\n   \\]\n\nSubstitute the expression for \\(a\\) from the second equation into the first equation:\n\n\\[\n(o + 17) + o = 48 \\\\\n2o + 17 = 48 \\\\\n2o = 48 - 17 \\\\\n2o = 31 \\\\\no = \\frac{31}{2} = 15.5\n\\]\n\nSince we are dealing with whole pieces of fruit, the numbers must be integers. The problem as stated leads to a non\u2011integer solution, which indicates that the numbers given (48 total and a difference of 17) are not compatible for whole fruit.\n\n**Corrected version**\n\nIf we instead say the total number of pieces of fruit is 49, the calculation works out:\n\n\\[\na + o = 49,\\qquad a = o + 17\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(o + 17) + o = 49 \\\\\n2o + 17 = 49 \\\\\n2o = 32 \\\\\no = 16\n\\]\n\nThen  \n\n\\[\na = o + 17 = 16 + 17 = 33\n\\]\n\n**Answer**\n\nMaria bought **33 apples** and **16 oranges** (with a total of 49 pieces of fruit)."
