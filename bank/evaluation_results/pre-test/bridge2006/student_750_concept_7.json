  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of comparing sums but struggles with identifying larger quantities when the sums are equal. They consistently state that equal sums are neither larger nor smaller, which is correct but does not answer the question of which is larger when applicable. More practice with identifying and comparing distinct sums is needed.",
