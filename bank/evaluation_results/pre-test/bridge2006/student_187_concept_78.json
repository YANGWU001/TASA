  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of common denominators, correctly identifying some least common denominators and explaining their importance. However, there are several misconceptions, particularly regarding the definition of common denominators and the methods to find them. The student should focus on understanding the concept of least common multiples and how to apply it accurately.",

      "question": "Explain the purpose of finding a common denominator when adding fractions.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the whole point of finding a common denominator when you add fractions is so that the fractions are kind of \u201con the same level.\u201d  By changing each fraction so they both have the same bottom number, you can line up the pieces and just add the top numbers together.  If the denominators are different, you can\u2019t really see how many equal parts you\u2019re dealing with, so you have to make them match first.  \n\n\u2026maybe it also helps to keep the fractions from getting bigger?  I guess when you rewrite them with a common denominator you\u2019re just converting them to an equivalent form, and then the addition is easier because you\u2019re only adding the numerators.  That\u2019s why we look for the least common denominator \u2013 so we don\u2019t make the numbers too big.  \n\nSo, basically, the common denominator makes the fractions comparable and lets us add the numerators directly."

      "question": "How do you find the least common denominator of two fractions?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the least common denominator by just multiplying the two denominators together.\u202fSo you take the denominator of each fraction and multiply them\u2014that product is the LCD. \n\nFor example, if you have \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\), you\u2019d do \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\).\u202fSo the least common denominator would be 24. \n\n(Then you\u2019d rewrite each fraction with 24 as the denominator.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think we need to find a denominator that both 9 and 3 go into. The easiest one is 9 (since 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f9).  \n\n- So 5/9 can stay the same: **5/9**.  \n- And 2/3 we multiply the top and bottom by 3, giving **6/9**.\n\n(You could also use 18 as a common denominator: 5/9\u202f=\u202f10/18 and 2/3\u202f=\u202f12/18, but 9 is the smallest one.)"

      "question": "Why is finding the least common denominator important for comparing fractions?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think finding the least common denominator is important because it lets you rewrite the fractions so they have the same bottom number.  When the denominators are the same you can just look at the top numbers to see which fraction is larger (or add/subtract them more easily).  I guess it also helps you find the biggest common factor of the fractions, which is why you pick the \u201cleast\u201d denominator\u2026?  (I'm not totally sure about that part.)"
