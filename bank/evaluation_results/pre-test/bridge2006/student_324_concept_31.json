    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain why placing 6 vertical bars in a rectangle results in 7 equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "When you draw vertical bars (straight lines) inside a rectangle, each bar separates the space on its left from the space on its right.  \n\n- The rectangle has two \u201cedges\u2019\u2019 on the left\u2011most and right\u2011most sides.  \n- If you add the first vertical bar, the rectangle is divided into **two** regions: the area between the left edge and the first bar, and the area between the first bar and the right edge.  \n- Adding a second bar inserts a new region **between** the first and second bars, while the regions on the outside remain unchanged. So now there are **three** regions.  \n\nEach additional vertical bar always creates exactly one new region: the strip that lies between the new bar and the bar (or edge) that is immediately to its left. Therefore, the number of equal divisions (regions) is always the number of bars **plus one** (the extra region comes from the rightmost edge of the rectangle).\n\nSo with **6** vertical bars:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of divisions}=6\\ (\\text{bars})+1\\ (\\text{edge on the right})=7\n\\]\n\nAll seven strips have the same width because the bars are spaced equally across the rectangle. Hence, placing six equally spaced vertical bars in a rectangle yields seven equal vertical divisions."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How does the number of vertical bars relate to the total number of equal divisions in a given shape?",
      "student_answer": "The vertical bars act as the division lines.\u202fEach time you draw a new vertical bar you split one of the existing pieces into two, so the total number of equal parts is **one more than the number of bars**.\n\n-\u202fIf there are 0 bars \u2192 1 whole piece.  \n-\u202fIf there is 1 bar \u2192 2 equal pieces.  \n-\u202fIf there are 2 bars \u2192 3 equal pieces, and so on.\n\nThus, for a shape that is divided only by vertical bars, the relationship is  \n\n**Number of equal divisions = (number of vertical bars)\u202f+\u202f1**."

      "student_answer": "Putting 10 equally\u2011spaced vertical bars inside a square turns the whole figure into a set of narrow, equal\u2011width strips.\n\n**Example**\n\n1. Start with a square whose side length is\u202f10\u202fcm.  \n2. Draw 10 vertical bars inside the square, spacing them so that the distance from the left edge of the square to the first bar, the distance between any two successive bars, and the distance from the last bar to the right edge are all the same.  \n3. Because there are 10 bars, the square is divided into **11** narrow rectangles (the regions between the left wall, each pair of neighbouring bars, and the right wall).  \n\nSince the total width of the square is 10\u202fcm, each of the 11 rectangles has a width of  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{10\\text{\u202fcm}}{11}\\approx 0.91\\text{\u202fcm},\n\\]\n\nso all the divisions are equal.  \n\nThus, by placing 10 vertical bars in a square we obtain 11 equal vertical divisions of the original area."
