This dot represents the integer\u202f7 on the number line.\n\nThe final picture looks like this (simplified):\n\n```\n... -3  -2  -1   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8 ...\n                         ^ \n                         |\n                     (dot at 7)\n```\n\nThe dot placed at the location labeled\u202f7 is the visual representation of the integer\u202f7 on the number line."

      "question": "Place the number 0 on a number line and explain its significance.",
      "student_answer": "**Placing\u202f0 on a number line**\n\n1. **Draw a straight horizontal line** that will serve as the number line.\n2. **Mark a point near the middle** of the line and label it **0**.  \n   - This point is called the **origin**.  \n   - It is the reference from which all other numbers are measured.\n\n**Why\u202f0 is important**\n\n- **Origin of measurement:** Every other integer (or real number) on the line is located by counting units to the right (positive numbers) or to the left (negative numbers) from 0.\n- **Separates the line:** 0 divides the number line into two halves: the right\u2011hand side contains the positive numbers (1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f\u2026) and the left\u2011hand side contains the negative numbers (\u20111,\u202f\u20112,\u202f\u20113,\u202f\u2026).\n- **Additive identity:** Adding 0 to any number leaves the number unchanged (\u202fa\u202f+\u202f0\u202f=\u202fa\u202f). This property makes 0 a neutral element in arithmetic.\n- **Reference for operations:** Many mathematical concepts\u2014such as absolute value, distance, and the concept of \u201cgreater than\u201d or \u201cless than\u201d\u2014are defined with respect to 0.\n\nSo, by placing 0 at the central point of the number line, we establish a baseline that lets us locate, compare, and operate with all other numbers."

      "student_answer": "**Step\u2011by\u2011step description**\n\n1. **Draw the baseline** \u2013 Sketch a straight horizontal line long enough to hold several points. This line will become the number line.\n\n2. **Mark the origin (0)** \u2013 Choose a point near the centre of the line and clearly label it \u201c0\u201d. This is the reference point from which all other integers will be measured.\n\n3. **Choose a unit length** \u2013 Decide how far apart successive integers will be. A common choice is to use a small, even spacing (e.g., 1\u202fcm or \u00bd\u202finches) for each unit.\n\n4. **Make the first tick to the right** \u2013 From the origin, move **rightward** (the positive direction) a distance equal to the unit length you have chosen. Place a short vertical tick mark at that spot.\n\n5. **Label the tick** \u2013 Write the numeral \u201c1\u201d directly above (or below) the tick mark you just made. This indicates that the point is one unit away from zero in the positive direction.\n\n6. **Check the spacing** \u2013 Ensure that the distance from 0 to the new \u201c1\u201d tick is exactly the same as the unit length you intended. If you plan to add more integers later, the same spacing will be used for 2, 3, etc.\n\n7. **Optional: add a direction arrow** \u2013 At the far right end of the line, draw a small arrow to indicate that the line continues indefinitely in the positive direction.\n\n**Result:** You now have the first positive integer,\u202f1, correctly marked on the number line, positioned one unit to the right of the origin (0) and clearly labelled. This provides the foundation for adding the rest of the integers in both the positive and negative directions."
