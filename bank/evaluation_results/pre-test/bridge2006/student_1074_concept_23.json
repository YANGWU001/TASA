In other words, if the two numbers have **no common prime factors** (they are *relatively prime* or *coprime*), the greatest common divisor is\u202f1, and the equation reduces to  \n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(a,b)=a\\cdot b .\n\\]\n\nSo whenever the numbers share nothing but the factor\u202f1\u2014 for example\u202f3\u202fand\u202f8,\u202f5\u202fand\u202f12,\u202f17\u202fand\u202f24\u2014 their LCM is simply their product.\n\nA related (though slightly less general) situation is when one of the numbers is\u202f1. Since\u202f1\u202fhas no prime factors, its GCD with any other integer is\u202f1, and the LCM of\u202f1\u202fand\u202f*n*\u202fis\u202f*n*, which also equals the product\u202f\\(1\\cdot n\\).\n\n(Another case that sometimes gets mentioned is when one number is a multiple of the other; however, in that situation the LCM is just the larger number, not the product, unless the smaller number is\u202f1.)"

      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 15 is **45**.\n\n- **Why?**  \n  - Prime factorization:  \n    - 9\u202f=\u202f3\u00b2  \n    - 15\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5  \n  - Take each prime factor the greatest number of times it appears in either factorization:  \n    - 3 appears as 3\u00b2 in 9, so we keep 3\u00b2.  \n    - 5 appears only in 15, so we keep 5.  \n  - Multiply those together: 3\u00b2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f9\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f45.\n\n- **Is the LCM the same as the product?**  \n  No. The product of 9 and 15 is **9\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f135**, which is much larger than the LCM (45). The LCM is the smallest number that both 9 and 15 divide into evenly, while the product is just the result of multiplying the two numbers together. \n\nSo, the LCM of 9 and 15 is 45, and it is **not** the same as their product (135)."

      "student_answer": "One easy pair is **4 and\u202f6**.\n\n**Why it works**\n\n1. **Find the LCM**  \n   The multiples of 4 are 4,\u202f8,\u202f12,\u202f16,\u2026  \n   The multiples of 6 are 6,\u202f12,\u202f18,\u2026  \n   The smallest common multiple is **12**.\n\n2. **Find the product**  \n   \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\).\n\n3. **Compare**  \n   \\( \\text{LCM}(4,6)=12\\) and \\(4\\cdot6 = 24\\).  \n   Clearly \\(12 < 24\\), so the LCM is less than the product.\n\n**General idea**\n\nFor any two positive integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\),\n\n\\[\na\\cdot b = \\operatorname{LCM}(a,b)\\times\\operatorname{GCD}(a,b).\n\\]\n\nSince the greatest common divisor (GCD) is always at least\u202f1, the product equals the LCM only when the GCD\u202f=\u202f1 (the numbers are relatively prime). Whenever the GCD is larger than\u202f1, the product is larger than the LCM. In our example, \\(\\operatorname{GCD}(4,6)=2\\), so the product \\(=12\\times2=24\\) is twice the LCM.

      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of **both** numbers.  \nWhen the two numbers share a common factor, the LCM will be **smaller** than their product because the shared factor does not have to be counted twice.\n\n---\n\n### 1.

Using the product\u2011over\u2011GCD formula  \n\nThe relationship between product, greatest common divisor (GCD), and LCM is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(a,b)=\\frac{a\\cdot b}{\\gcd(a,b)} .\n\\]\n\nFirst find the GCD of 10 and 15:\n\n- Both numbers share the factor \\(5\\), and there is no larger common factor, so  \n  \\(\\gcd(10,15)=5\\).\n\nNow apply the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(10,15)=\\frac{10 \\times 15}{5}\n                 =\\frac{150}{5}\n                 =30.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 3. Why the LCM is not the product  \n\nIf the two numbers had **no common factors** (i.e., they were relatively prime), the GCD would be 1 and the LCM would equal the product.  \nBecause 10 and 15 share the factor \\(5\\), the product \\(10 \\times 15 = 150\\) counts that factor twice. The LCM removes the duplicate by dividing by the GCD:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM} = \\frac{\\text{product}}{\\gcd}= \\frac{150}{5}=30.\n\\]\n\nThus, the LCM of 10 and 15 is **30**, not their product **150**. The difference arises from the common factor \\(5\\) they share."
