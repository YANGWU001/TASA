      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nYes \u2013 a square can be cut up into a bunch of congruent (equal\u2011size) triangles.  \nThe easiest way to see this is to draw a single diagonal of the square:\n\n```\n+-----------+\n| \\         |\n|   \\       |\n|     \\     |\n|       \\   |\n|         \\ |\n+-----------+\n```\n\nThe diagonal splits the square into **two right\u2011angled triangles** that are exactly the same size and shape. Because the two triangles together use up the whole area of the square, they form a perfect tiling with no gaps or overlaps.\n\nYou can also create other equal\u2011triangle tilings. For example:\n\n* **Four congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles:** Draw both diagonals. The two diagonals intersect at the centre, giving four identical triangles.\n* **Many small congruent triangles:** Divide each side of the square into *n* equal segments, join the division points to a common interior point (or to opposite corners), and you\u2019ll get a collection of equal triangles that fill the square.\n\n---\n\n### Why it works\n\nA triangle is the simplest polygon that can fill any planar region when arranged appropriately. When you cut a square along straight lines that meet at vertices or at the centre, the pieces you create can be made to have exactly the same side lengths and angles, so they are congruent triangles. As long as the lines you draw respect the symmetry of the square, the resulting pieces will fit together perfectly.\n\n---\n\n### A note about special triangles\n\nIf you require the triangles to be **equilateral** (all sides equal), a perfect tiling of a square is *not* possible. The interior angles of an equilateral triangle are 60\u00b0, and the angles around any point in a square must add up to 360\u00b0. Since 360\u00b0 \u00f7 60\u00b0 = 6, you would need six equilateral triangles meeting at a point, which would create a hexagonal shape, not a square. So while a square can be divided into many congruent triangles, it cannot be tiled by congruent equilateral triangles without leaving gaps or extending beyond the square\u2019s boundaries.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** A square can definitely be divided into equal triangles (e.g., two or four right\u2011isosceles triangles), but it cannot be tiled by equal **equilateral** triangles. The ability to do so depends on the shape of the triangle you choose."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "Each smaller square will have a side length of  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{\\sqrt{36}} = \\frac{12}{6} = 2\n\\]\n\nSo the side of each of the 36 equal squares is **2 units**."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is cut into several **equal** pieces, each piece must have the same length and the same width.  \nA **square** has the special property that its length\u202f=\u202fits width.  \n\nIf we divide the original square by drawing straight cuts that are parallel to its sides, the only way each piece can keep the length\u2011equals\u2011width property is to make the cuts at intervals that are the same fraction of the side length in both directions. That would produce smaller **squares**, not rectangles.\n\nWhen the cuts are made so that the pieces are **rectangles**, the cuts are spaced differently in the two directions \u2013 for example, we might cut the square into three vertical strips or into two horizontal strips. In that case each piece has one side equal to the full side of the original square and the other side equal to only a fraction of it. Consequently the two sides of each piece are not equal, so the pieces are rectangles, not squares.\n\nIn short, a rectangle\u2019s length and width are different. Dividing a square into several equal pieces that are rectangles forces at least one dimension of each piece to be a different fraction of the original side length than the other dimension, breaking the \u201cequal sides\u201d condition required for a shape to be a square. Therefore the resulting equal parts are rectangles, not squares."

      "student_answer": "The original square has side\u202f=\u202f3\u202funits.  \nDividing it into 9 equal smaller squares means creating a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid (3 rows and 3 columns).  \n\nSince the total side length is 3\u202funits and the grid has 3 equal segments along each side, the side length of each smaller square is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{3\\text{ units}}{3}=1\\text{ unit}.\n\\]\n\nSo every one of the nine little squares is a **1\u202funit\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202funit** square.\n\n---\n\n### Sketch (ASCII)\n\n```\n+---+---+---+\n|   |   |   |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 |\n|   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+\n|   |   |   |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 |\n|   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+\n|   |   |   |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 |\n|   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+\n```\n\n*Each \u201c1\u201d inside a small cell indicates a side length of 1\u202funit for that smaller square.*"
