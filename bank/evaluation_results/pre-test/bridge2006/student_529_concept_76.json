  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of how to find the GCF using various methods, including listing factors, prime factorization, and the Euclidean algorithm. However, there was a mistake in Question 3 where the GCF of 18, 24, and 30 was incorrectly identified as 3 instead of 6. Additionally, in Question 10, the example provided for simplifying fractions contained an error, as the fraction could be simplified further. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should double-check calculations for accuracy.",

      "student_answer": "Sure, I\u2019ll try to explain how to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers.\n\n1. **List the factors** \u2013 First I would write down all of the factors of each number.  \n   For example, if the numbers are\u202f12\u202fand\u202f18, the factors are:  \n   - 12:\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f12  \n   - 18:\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f18  \n\n2. **Find the common ones** \u2013 Next, I look for the numbers that appear in both lists.  \n   In the example the common factors are\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f6.\n\n3. **Pick the biggest** \u2013 The greatest of those common factors is the GCF.  \n   So the GCF of\u202f12\u202fand\u202f18\u202fis\u202f6.\n\n---\n\n**A quicker method (the Euclidean algorithm)**  \n\nI think you can also use the Euclidean algorithm, which works like this:\n\n1. Divide the larger number by the smaller number.  \n   Example:\u202f18 \u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f1\u202fremainder\u202f6.  \n\n2. Then **replace the larger number with the smaller number** and the smaller number with the remainder.  \n   So now we have 12 and 6.\n\n3. Divide again:\u202f12 \u00f7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f2\u202fremainder\u202f0.  \n\n4. When the remainder becomes\u202f0, the divisor you just used (the last non\u2011zero remainder) is the GCF.  \n   In this case the GCF is\u202f6.\n\nI\u2019ve heard that sometimes people stop when the remainder is less than the divisor and just call that remainder the GCF, but I think the correct rule is to keep going until the remainder is\u202f0, and then the divisor you used in that last step is the answer. \n\nSo, in short, you can either list all factors and choose the biggest common one, or you can use the Euclidean algorithm by repeatedly dividing and swapping until the remainder is\u202f0; the last divisor you used is the GCF."

      "student_answer": "The student is **not** correct.  \n\nThe greatest common factor (GCF) is the largest whole number that divides **both** numbers exactly.  \n\n- The factors of\u202f12 are\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f12.  \n- The factors of\u202f15 are\u202f1,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f15.  \n\nThe common factors are\u202f1\u202fand\u202f3, and the largest of these is\u202f3.  \n\nSo the GCF of 12 and 15 is **3**, not 6.

      "student_answer": "To use the Euclidean algorithm you repeatedly divide the larger number by the smaller one and keep track of the remainders.\n\n1. Start with the two numbers, call them \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) (let\u2019s say \\(a>b\\)).  \n2. Divide \\(a\\) by \\(b\\) and write the remainder \\(r\\):\u2003\\(a = b\\cdot q + r\\).  \n3. Now replace the pair \\((a,b)\\) with \\((b,r)\\) and repeat the division: divide the old divisor \\(b\\) by the new remainder \\(r\\).  \n4. Continue this process \u2013 each step you replace the old pair with the last divisor and the last remainder.  \n\nYou stop when a remainder of **0** is obtained.  \nThe number that you just divided by (the last non\u2011zero remainder, or equivalently the divisor from the step before the zero remainder) is the greatest common factor (GCF).\n\nSo, in short, you keep doing \u201cdivide\u2011and\u2011take\u2011the\u2011remainder\u201d until the remainder is zero; the last non\u2011zero remainder you got is the GCF.
