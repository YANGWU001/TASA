      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "I think there would be **4 rows and 4 columns** of the smaller squares, since\u202f4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f16."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "I think each piece gets smaller \u2013 when you split a square into more equal sections, the area (and thus the size) of each individual part decreases."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "If a square is divided horizontally and vertically into 4 equal sections, what is the shape of each section?",
      "student_answer": "I think each of the four sections is a smaller square."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "I think a square **can** be divided into equal triangles.  \nFor example, if you draw one diagonal across the square, you split it into two right\u2011angled triangles that are congruent (they have the same shape and area). You can also draw both diagonals; that gives you four smaller triangles, each with the same area and shape.  \n\nThe reason this works is that triangles can tile a square without leaving any gaps or overlaps, as long as the lines you draw are chosen so that each piece has the same size. So a square doesn\u2019t have to be broken only into smaller squares; it can be broken into equal triangles as well."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "I think each of the smaller squares would have a side length of  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{\\sqrt{36}}=\\frac{12}{6}=2,\n\\]\n\nso the side of each little square is about **2 units**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "I think the main reason is that a square has all four sides the same length, while a rectangle only requires the opposite sides to be equal. When you cut a square into several equal\u2011area pieces that are rectangles, you\u2019re usually splitting one of the sides into smaller sections while leaving the other side unchanged.  \n\nFor example, if you draw a vertical line right down the middle of a square, each half has the full height of the original square but only half the width. Those two pieces are rectangles whose height\u202f\u2260\u202fwidth, so they can\u2019t be squares. The same thing happens if you draw horizontal lines or a grid of vertical and horizontal lines \u2013 at least one dimension of each piece will be different from the other dimension, so the pieces are rectangles, not squares.  \n\nIn short, because the definition of a square is \u201call sides equal,\u201d any division that creates pieces with two different side lengths (even if the areas are equal) will give you rectangles, not squares. (If you wanted the pieces to be squares you\u2019d have to cut the original square into smaller squares, not just any equal rectangles.)"

      "question": "Draw a square divided into 9 equal sections and label the dimensions of each smaller square if the original square has a side length of 3 units.",
      "student_answer": "Here\u2019s one way to picture the square\u202f\u2014\u202fa 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid of equal smaller squares.  \n\n```\n+---+---+---+\n|   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+\n|   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+\n|   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+\n```\n\nThe original square has side\u2011length\u202f3\u202funits.  \nDividing it into 9 equal smaller squares (3 rows\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 columns) means each small square gets a side length of  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{3\\text{ units}}{3}=1\\text{ unit}.\n\\]\n\nSo, each little square is **1\u202funit\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202funit** (area\u202f=\u202f1\u202fsq\u202funit).  \n\n*(I think this is the right labeling \u2013 the side of each sub\u2011square should be 1 unit.)*"
