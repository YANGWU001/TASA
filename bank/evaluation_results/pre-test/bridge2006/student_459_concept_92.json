      "student_answer": "A\u202fwhole\u2011number lower bound is the greatest integer that is **still less than or equal to** a given number (or to the true value of something we\u2019re estimating). In other words, when we look at a number that might not be an integer\u2014like 7.3, 5\u202f\u2154, or the exact value of a complicated expression\u2014we round it **down** to the nearest whole number. That rounded\u2011down integer is the whole\u2011number lower bound.\n\n**Key points**\n\n1. **\u201cLower\u201d means not exceeding the original value.** The bound can never be larger than the number we\u2019re bounding.\n2. **It must be a whole number (an integer).** Fractions or decimals are not allowed.\n3. **It is the \u201clargest\u201d such integer.** If you tried any bigger integer, you would go over the original number, so the lower bound is the biggest integer that stays under or exactly at the value.\n\n**Example:**  \nIf the quantity we\u2019re interested in is 12.7, the whole\u2011number lower bound is 12, because 12\u202f\u2264\u202f12.7 and 13\u202f>\u202f12.7.  \n\nThus, the whole\u2011number lower bound gives us a safe, integer\u2011valued underestimate of the actual quantity."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, the whole\u2011number lower bound of\u202f9.99 is **9**, not 10.\n\n**Why:**  \nThe whole\u2011number lower bound (also called the *floor* of a number) is the greatest integer that is **less than or equal to** the given number.  \n\n- For 9.99, the integers less than or equal to it are \u2026\u202f7,\u202f8,\u202f9.  \n- The largest of those integers is **9**.  \n\nSince 10 is greater than 9.99, it cannot be a lower bound.

      "student_answer": "Rounding is used to \u201csnap\u201d the original number down to the nearest whole\u2011number that does not exceed it.  \nWhen we look for the **whole\u2011number lower bound** we are essentially applying the floor function:\n\n\\[\n\\text{lower\u2011bound}(x)=\\lfloor x\\rfloor\n\\]\n\nSo the role of rounding is to discard any fractional part (or any part that would push the value above the integer) and keep the greatest integer that is **less than or equal to** the given number.  \n\n*Example*:  \nIf \\(x = 7.84\\), rounding **down** (floor\u2011rounding) gives 7. That 7 is the whole\u2011number lower bound of 7.84 because any whole number smaller than 7 would be too low, and 8 would be too high.  \n\nIn short, rounding down (or \u201cfloor\u201d rounding) provides the precise whole\u2011number that serves as the lower bound for any non\u2011integer quantity."
