Most answers are correct, showing clear reasoning and methods. However, the prime factorization method in Question 4 was incorrect, as the GCF should be 15, but the explanation was not fully accurate in terms of common factors. Overall, the student has a solid grasp of the concepts.",

      "student_answer": "When one of the numbers is a multiple of the other, the greatest common factor (GCF) is simply the smaller number\u2014the one that divides the larger one.  \n\n**Why this works**\n\n- Suppose the two numbers are \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(b = k \\cdot a\\) for some integer \\(k\\).  \n- Every factor of \\(a\\) also divides \\(b\\) because \\(b\\) is just \\(a\\) repeated \\(k\\) times.  \n- Therefore the set of common factors of\u202f\\(a\\) and\u202f\\(b\\) is exactly the set of factors of \\(a\\).  \n- The greatest element in that set is \\(a\\) itself, so \\(\\text{GCF}(a,b)=a\\).\n\n**Quick way to check**\n\n1. Identify which number is smaller.  \n2. Verify that the larger number divided by the smaller number leaves no remainder (i.e., the smaller number is a divisor).  \n3. If it divides evenly, the GCF is the smaller number.  \n\n**Example**\n\n- Numbers: 12 and 36.  \n- 36 \u00f7 12 = 3 with no remainder, so 12 is a factor of 36.  \n- Hence, \\(\\text{GCF}(12,36)=12\\).\n\n**Alternative shortcut (Euclidean algorithm)**  \n\nIf you\u2019re not sure whether one number is a multiple of the other, you can run one step of the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n- Compute the remainder of the larger divided by the smaller.  \n- If the remainder is 0, the smaller number is the GCF.\n\nThis avoids fully factoring either number while still giving you the correct GCF."

      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers is the largest whole number that divides **both** of them without leaving a remainder.\n\n- The factors of\u202f7 are\u202f1 and\u202f7.  \n- The factors of\u202f21 are\u202f1,\u202f3,\u202f7,\u202fand\u202f21.\n\nThe numbers that appear in **both** lists of factors are\u202f1 and\u202f7.  \nSince\u202f7\u202fis larger than\u202f1, it is the greatest (largest) common factor.\n\nAnother way to see it is by looking at the multiplication forms:\n\n-\u202f7\u202f=\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f1  \n-\u202f21\u202f=\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f3  \n\nBoth numbers contain the factor\u202f7, and no larger number can divide 7 (except 7 itself), so the GCF of\u202f7\u202fand\u202f21\u202fmust be\u202f7."

      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011life situation where you need the greatest common factor (GCF) of a number and one of its multiples is when you\u2019re trying to **divide a set of items into the largest possible equal groups without leftovers**.\n\n**Scenario \u2013 Packing Boxes for a Store**\n\nA retailer receives a shipment of 240 identical cans of soup. The store wants to pack these cans into boxes so that each box holds the same number of cans and the boxes are as full as possible. The supplier ships the cans in cases of 60 cans each (which is a multiple of the total number of cans: 60\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f240).  \n\nTo determine the biggest box size that will allow the store to use the whole shipment without any cans left over, the store can find the GCF of the total number of cans (240) and the case size (60).\n\n\\[\n\\text{GCF}(240,60)=60\n\\]\n\nBecause the GCF is 60, the store can pack the cans into boxes that hold **60 cans each**. This means they will need exactly 4 boxes (240\u202f\u00f7\u202f60\u202f=\u202f4) and there will be no leftovers.  \n\nIf the store tried a larger box size (say 80 cans), it would not work because 80 does not divide evenly into 240, and they would have leftover cans. The GCF tells them the largest possible equal\u2011size grouping that works for both the total shipment and the case packaging.\n\n**Why the GCF helps**\n\n- It guarantees the groups are as large as possible, minimizing the number of containers needed.\n- It ensures there are no leftover items, which saves time and reduces waste.\n- It works whenever one quantity is a multiple of the other (or when both share a common factor), making it a quick way to decide the optimal grouping size.\n\nThus, finding the GCF of a number and its multiple is a practical tool for efficient packing, distribution, and inventory management."
