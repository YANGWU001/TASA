      "question": "If a square is divided into 4 equal parts, how many smaller squares are formed?",

      "student_answer": "The square is partitioned into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, so each of the 9 equal parts is itself a **smaller square**."

      "student_answer": "The 25 equal parts form a 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 grid.  \nSo each row contains **5 parts**."

      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into more equal sections, each individual part becomes smaller.\u202fThe total area of the square stays the same, so as the number of equal pieces increases, the area (and thus the size) of each piece must decrease proportionally."

      "question": "If a square is divided horizontally and vertically into 4 equal sections, what is the shape of each section?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the four sections is itself a **square**. By drawing one horizontal line through the center and one vertical line through the center of the original square, the shape is divided into four congruent smaller squares."

      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:**\u202fYes \u2013 a square can be divided into congruent (equal) triangles.\n\n**Why this works**\n\n1. **Simple two\u2011triangle division** \u2013 Draw one of the square\u2019s diagonals. The diagonal splits the square into two right\u2011angled triangles that are mirror images of each other.  \n   *Both triangles have the same side lengths (the two legs are the side of the square, the hypotenuse is the diagonal) and the same angles, so they are congruent.*\n\n2. **Four\u2011triangle division** \u2013 Draw both diagonals. Their intersection is the centre of the square, and each diagonal creates a right\u2011angled triangle whose legs are half the side of the square. All four triangles are identical (congruent) right triangles.\n\n3. **More triangles are possible** \u2013 By choosing a point on one side of the square and joining it to the opposite side (or to the opposite vertices), you can create any even number of congruent triangles (2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f\u2026\u202f). The key is that each triangle must share the same set of side lengths and angles, which can be arranged by using the square\u2019s symmetry.\n\n**Conclusion**  \nBecause a square\u2019s sides are equal and its angles are all 90\u00b0, you can cut it along straight lines (such as its diagonals or lines radiating from a centre point) to produce pieces that are identical triangles. Therefore a square can certainly be divided into equal triangles rather than squares."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When we cut a square into several **equal rectangles**, each piece must share the same dimensions, but those dimensions cannot both stay equal to the side\u2011length of the original square (except in the trivial case of \u201cone piece,\u201d i.e., doing nothing).  \n\nA rectangle is defined by two side\u2011lengths: a **length** and a **width**.  \nA square is a special rectangle whose length\u202f=\u202fwidth.\n\nSuppose the original square has side\u2011length \\(s\\).  \nIf we divide it into \\(n>1\\) congruent rectangles, the division must be made by drawing straight cuts parallel to the sides of the square (otherwise the pieces would not be rectangles).  \n\nThere are two basic ways to do that:\n\n1. **Vertical cuts only** \u2013 we slice the square into \\(n\\) vertical strips.  \n   Each strip has width \\(\\dfrac{s}{n}\\) and height \\(s\\).  \n   Its dimensions are \\(\\displaystyle\\left(\\frac{s}{n}\\right)\\times s\\).  \n   Since \\(\\frac{s}{n}\\neq s\\) for any \\(n>1\\), the width and height are different, so the piece is a rectangle, not a square.\n\n2. **Horizontal cuts only** \u2013 we slice the square into \\(n\\) horizontal strips.  \n   Each strip has height \\(\\dfrac{s}{n}\\) and width \\(s\\).  \n   Its dimensions are \\(s\\times\\displaystyle\\left(\\frac{s}{n}\\right)\\), again unequal for \\(n>1\\).\n\nIf we try a grid of cuts, say \\(a\\) vertical and \\(b\\) horizontal cuts (producing \\(ab\\) pieces), each piece has dimensions \\(\\displaystyle\\frac{s}{a}\\times\\frac{s}{b}\\).  \nFor the piece to be a square we would need \\(\\frac{s}{a}=\\frac{s}{b}\\), which forces \\(a=b\\).  \nBut then the number of pieces is \\(a^{2}\\). The only way each piece can still be the original size \\(s\\times s\\) is when \\(a=b=1\\) (i.e., no division). Any other choice makes the sides of each piece shorter than \\(s\\) in at least one direction, so they are rectangles, not squares.\n\n**In summary:**  \nDividing a square into more than one equal part inevitably shortens one side of each part while leaving the other side at the original length (or shortens both sides by different factors in a grid). Because a square requires both sides to be equal, the resulting pieces cannot be squares; they are necessarily rectangles."
