  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of addition and comparison in some cases, correctly identifying larger sums in Questions 3, 5, 6, and 7. However, they incorrectly state equality in several instances where one sum is larger than the other. This suggests a misunderstanding of the concept of comparing quantities. More practice with identifying larger sums is recommended.",

      "student_answer": "Both expressions give the same result:  \n\n\\(5 + 3 = 8\\) and \\(6 + 2 = 8\\).  \n\nSo, neither is larger; they are equal."

      "student_answer": "No. Adding 12\u202f+\u202f7 gives 19, and 15\u202f+\u202f4 also equals 19, so the first sum is not larger than the second."

      "question": "Solve and determine which is greater: 3 + 4 or 2 + 5?",
      "student_answer": "First, add the numbers in each pair:\n\n- \\(3 + 4 = 7\\)\n- \\(2 + 5 = 7\\)\n\nBoth sums are the same, so neither expression is greater than the other. They are equal."

      "student_answer": "The sum\u202f5\u202f+\u202f6\u202f=\u202f11 is larger than the sum\u202f7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, so **5\u202f+\u202f6** represents the larger quantity."

      "student_answer": "The sum \\(18 + 19 = 37\\) is larger than the sum \\(20 + 15 = 35\\). So **18\u202f+\u202f19** is the larger sum."
