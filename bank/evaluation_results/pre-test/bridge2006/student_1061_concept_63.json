      "question": "Explain how percentages are used to calculate parts in real-world scenarios.",
      "student_answer": "Percentages are a handy way to turn a \u201cpart\u201d of something into a number that can be compared with the whole, and they show up in a lot of everyday calculations.\n\n1. **Finding a part of a whole** \u2013 If you know the total amount (the \u201cwhole\u201d) and the percentage you need, you usually multiply the whole by the decimal form of the percentage.  \n   *Example:* 25\u202f% of a $80 bill is\u202f0.25\u202f\u00d7\u202f80\u202f=\u202f$20. (This is correct.)\n\n2. **Finding the whole from a part** \u2013 When you only have the part and the percent it represents, you normally **divide** the part by the decimal.  \n   *Example:* If $15 is 30\u202f% of a total, the total is\u202f15\u202f\u00f7\u202f0.30\u202f=\u202f$50. (Correct.)\n\n3. **Discounts and sales** \u2013 A discount is usually **subtracted** from the original price, not added.  \n   *Example:* A 10\u202f% discount on a $200 item reduces the price to\u202f200\u202f\u2013\u202f(0.10\u202f\u00d7\u202f200)\u202f=\u202f$180. (Correct.)\n\n4. **Taxes** \u2013 Some people think you add the tax percentage to the price, but you actually **multiply** the price by (1\u202f+\u202ftax\u202frate).  \n   *Example:* With a 7\u202f% sales tax, a $50 item costs\u202f50\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.07\u202f=\u202f$53.50. (Correct.)\n\n5. **Proportions in recipes** \u2013 If a recipe calls for 40\u202f% flour and you want to make a 500\u2011gram batch, you multiply 0.40\u202f\u00d7\u202f500\u202f=\u202f200\u202fg of flour. (Correct.)\n\n6. **Interest calculations** \u2013 Simple interest is often calculated by multiplying the principal by the interest rate and the time period.  \n   *Example:* $1,000 at 5\u202f% per year for 2 years gives\u202f1000\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.05\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f$100 interest. (Correct.)\n\n7. **Conversion mistakes** \u2013 A common slip is to **multiply** a part by the percentage instead of dividing when you need the whole.  \n   *Wrong example:* Thinking that $30 is 60\u202f% of a total means the total is\u202f30\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.60\u202f=\u202f$18 (which is not right). (Incorrect.)\n\n8. **Percent of change** \u2013 When something goes from 80 to 100, many say the increase is \u201c20\u202f%,\u201d but technically it\u2019s a 25\u202f% increase because (100\u201180)\u202f\u00f7\u202f80\u202f=\u202f0.25. (Correct, but many get it wrong.)\n\n9. **Population demographics** \u2013 If 15\u202f% of a city\u2019s 200,000 residents are seniors, you calculate the number of seniors as\u202f0.15\u202f\u00d7\u202f200,000\u202f=\u202f30,000. (Correct.)\n\n10. **Budget allocations** \u2013 Sometimes people incorrectly think that \u201c30\u202f% of the budget\u201d means you should **add** 30\u202f% to the existing amount, when actually you allocate 30\u202f% of the total to a specific category. (Incorrect wording.)\n\nOverall, percentages let us turn vague \u201cparts of a whole\u201d into precise numbers, whether we\u2019re discounting a price, figuring out taxes, scaling recipes, or analyzing data. Just remember the two key steps:  \n\u2011 *Multiply* the whole by the decimal to get a part.  \n\u2011 *Divide* the part by the decimal to get the whole.  \n\n(There may be other ways to use percentages, but these are the most common in daily life.)"

      "question": "Describe the difference between calculating a part using percentages versus using fractions.",
      "student_answer": "When you work out \u201ca part\u201d of a whole you can express the relationship either as a **percentage** or as a **fraction**, and the mechanics are slightly different.\n\n* **Percentages** are always out of\u202f100.  To find the part you take the whole amount and multiply it by the percentage written as a decimal (\u202f% \u00f7\u202f100\u202f).  \n  *Example:*\u202fIf you need 25\u202f% of 80, you do \\(80 \\times 0.25 = 20\\).\n\n* **Fractions** show the part as a ratio of two whole numbers (numerator\u202f/\u202fdenominator).  To find the part you multiply the whole by that fraction directly.  \n  *Example:*\u202fIf you need \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of 80, you do \\(80 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 20\\).\n\nThe main difference is the **scale** you\u2019re using: percentages use a fixed denominator of\u202f100, whereas fractions can have any denominator that makes sense for the situation.  Because of this, percentages are often easier to read when you\u2019re dealing with \u201cper\u2011hundred\u201d contexts (like discounts, interest rates, or survey results), while fractions are handy when the division of the whole is naturally expressed in simpler ratios (like \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) of a pizza).\n\nIn practice you can convert between the two: a percentage is just a fraction with denominator\u202f100 (e.g., 25\u202f%\u202f=\u202f\\(\\frac{25}{100} = \\frac{1}{4}\\)).  So the actual calculation steps are the same\u2014multiply the whole by the appropriate number\u2014only the representation differs.  I think the only real \u201cgotcha\u201d is remembering to turn the percent into a decimal before you multiply; otherwise the process is pretty straightforward."
