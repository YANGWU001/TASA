  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of GCF, correctly identifying factors and applying methods to find the GCF in most cases. However, there were a few incorrect answers, particularly in Questions 1, 4, and 9, indicating some confusion with specific examples. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the topic.",

      "question": "Explain what the greatest common factor (GCF) represents in mathematics.",
      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (often called the GCF) is the **largest whole number that can divide two or more given numbers without leaving a remainder**.  In other words, it\u2019s the biggest \u201cshared\u201d factor that the numbers have in common.  \n\nFor example, if you look at 12 and 18, the factors of 12 are\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f12 and the factors of 18 are\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f18.  The biggest number that appears in both lists is\u202f6, so the GCF of 12 and 18 is\u202f6.  \n\nThe GCF is useful when you want to simplify fractions (you divide the numerator and denominator by their GCF) and when you are factoring expressions.  It is also related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) \u2013\u202fin fact, many textbooks use those two terms interchangeably.  \n\nSometimes people think the GCF is the product of all the prime factors the numbers share, but that\u2019s not quite right; you only take the **lowest power of each common prime** when you multiply them together.  For 12\u202f=\u202f2\u00b2\u00b73 and 18\u202f=\u202f2\u00b73\u00b2, the common primes are 2 and 3, and you would use 2\u00b9\u00b73\u00b9\u202f=\u202f6, not 2\u00b2\u00b73\u00b2.  \n\nI think the GCF can also be used to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers, although the exact relationship is a bit fuzzy in my mind \u2013 I remember there\u2019s a formula involving the product of the numbers divided by the GCF, but I\u2019m not completely sure how it works in every case.  \n\nSo, overall, the GCF tells you the biggest factor that two or more numbers share, which helps with simplifying and factoring, even though I sometimes get mixed up with the details of how it connects to other concepts like the LCM."
