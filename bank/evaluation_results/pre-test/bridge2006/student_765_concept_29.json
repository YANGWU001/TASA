      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers is the largest whole number that divides **both** of them without leaving a remainder.\n\nLet\u2019s call the smaller number \\(a\\).  \nIf the larger number is a multiple of \\(a\\), we can write it as  \n\n\\[\nb = k\\;a\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(k\\) is an integer (for a true multiple, \\(k\\ge 2\\)).\n\nNow consider any number \\(d\\) that is a common factor of both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n* Because \\(d\\) divides \\(a\\), we have \\(a = d\\;m\\) for some integer \\(m\\).\n* Substituting \\(a\\) into the expression for \\(b\\) gives  \n\n\\[\nb = k\\;a = k\\;(d\\;m) = d\\;(k\\,m)\n\\]\n\nso \\(d\\) also divides \\(b\\).\n\nThus **every** common factor of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be a factor of \\(a\\).  \nThe largest factor that \\(a\\) has is \\(a\\) itself. Consequently the greatest of the common factors cannot be larger than \\(a\\); the only factor that is as large as possible and still divides both numbers is \\(a\\).\n\nTherefore the GCF of a number and any of its multiples is always the smaller number."

      "student_answer": "When one of the numbers is a multiple of the other, you don\u2019t have to do any full prime\u2011factor work at all.  \nBecause the larger number can be written as  \n\n\\[\n\\text{larger}=k\\;\\times\\;\\text{smaller}\n\\]\n\n(the smaller number divides the larger exactly), every factor of the smaller number is automatically a factor of the larger one.  Consequently the *greatest* common factor can\u2019t be bigger than the smaller number, and it *must* be the smaller number itself.\n\nSo the shortcut is simply:\n\n1. Identify which of the two numbers is the smaller.\n2. Verify that the larger number is a multiple of the smaller (i.e., check that the division leaves no remainder).\n3. Conclude that the GCF is the smaller number.\n\nYou can also see this with the Euclidean algorithm:  \n\n\\[\n\\gcd(a,b)=\\gcd(b,\\,a\\bmod b)\n\\]\n\nIf \\(a\\) is a multiple of \\(b\\), then \\(a\\bmod b = 0\\), so  \n\n\\[\n\\gcd(a,b)=\\gcd(b,0)=b,\n\\]\n\nagain giving the smaller number as the GCF."

      "question": "If the GCF of two numbers is 20 and one of the numbers is 80, what could the other number be?",
      "student_answer": "Since the greatest common factor must be 20, the other number has to be a multiple of\u202f20 but it must not share any extra factor of\u202f2 with 80 (otherwise the GCF would be larger than\u202f20).  \n\nSo the other number can be any number of the form  \n\n\\[\n20 \\times (\\text{odd integer}),\n\\]\n\ne.g., \\(20, 60, 100,\\dots\\)\n\nOne possible answer is **60**."

      "student_answer": "One everyday situation where you would look for the greatest common factor (GCF) of a number and one of its multiples is when you\u2019re trying to **arrange items into the biggest possible equal groups without leftovers**.\n\n**Example: Packing snack bags**\n\nImagine you run a small coffee shop and you want to pack two different snack items into the same kind of pre\u2011made gift bag:\n\n* You have **48 granola bars**.\n* You also want to include **a multiple of that amount of pretzel sticks**, say **96 pretzel sticks** (because the pretzel supplier only sells them in boxes of 96).\n\nYou\u2019d like each gift bag to contain the same number of granola bars **and** the same number of pretzel sticks, and you want the bags to be as large as possible so you don\u2019t waste space.  \n\nTo figure out the largest possible number of bags you can make, you find the **GCF of 48 and 96**:\n\n\\[\n\\text{GCF}(48,96) = 48\n\\]\n\nSo you can make **48 bags**, each containing **1 granola bar** and **2 pretzel sticks** (since\u202f96 \u00f7 48\u202f=\u202f2).  \n\nIf you had tried to use a larger group size (say 60 bags), you would end up with leftover pretzel sticks because 60 does not divide 96 evenly. The GCF tells you the biggest group size that works for both numbers.\n\n---\n\n### Why the GCF matters here\n* **Maximizes the size of each group** (or each bag) so you don\u2019t end up with tiny, inefficient packages.\n* **Ensures no leftovers**\u2014every granola bar and pretzel stick is used.\n* **Simplifies ordering** \u2013 knowing the GCF helps you decide how many of each product to order in the future.\n\n---\n\n#### A tiny slip\u2011up you might see\nSometimes people mix up the GCF with the **least common multiple (LCM)**. The LCM tells you the smallest number that both amounts can \u201cfit into,\u201d which would be useful if you wanted to know the smallest total amount of snacks you could buy that would let you make the same number of bags for each item. In this packing problem, though, the GCF is the right tool because we\u2019re looking for the **largest equal group size**, not the smallest common total."
