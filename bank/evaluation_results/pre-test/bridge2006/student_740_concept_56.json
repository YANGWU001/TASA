  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of proper fractions, correctly identifying them and explaining their characteristics. The only mistake was in Question 5, where the student incorrectly identified 15/20 as a proper fraction; it is actually an improper fraction since 15 is equal to 20. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the topic.",
