For example, the GCF of\u202f12\u202fand\u202f18\u202fis\u202f6, because\u202f6\u202fdivides both numbers and no larger number does.\n\n(It\u2019s also sometimes (incorrectly) said to be the smallest number that the given numbers can be divided **into**, but that description actually belongs to the least common multiple, not the GCF.)"
