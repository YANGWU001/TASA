      "student_answer": "When a number \\(a\\) is multiplied by an integer \\(k\\) (where \\(k\\ge 1\\)), we get a multiple \\(b = k\\cdot a\\).  \nBy definition, the greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides **both** of them.\n\nBecause \\(b\\) was created by multiplying \\(a\\) by an integer, every factor of \\(a\\) is automatically a factor of \\(b\\). In particular, \\(a\\) itself divides \\(b\\) (since \\(b = k\\cdot a\\)).  \n\nTherefore the set of common factors of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is exactly the set of factors of \\(a\\). The largest element in that set is \\(a\\) itself. Hence the GCF of a number and any of its multiples is the smaller number, \\(a\\)."

      "student_answer": "If one of the two numbers is an exact multiple of the other, the greatest common factor is simply the smaller number.  \n\n**Why this works**\n\n- Let the two numbers be\u202f\\(a\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fwith\u202f\\(a<b\\)\u202fand suppose\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fis a multiple of\u202f\\(a\\).  \n- Then\u202f\\(b = k\\cdot a\\)\u202ffor some integer\u202f\\(k\\).  \n- Every divisor of\u202f\\(a\\)\u202falso divides\u202f\\(b\\)\u202f(because \\(b\\) is just\u202f\\(a\\)\u202ftimes\u202f\\(k\\)).  \n- Conversely, any common divisor of\u202f\\(a\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fmust divide \\(a\\) (the smaller number).  \n- Therefore the largest number that divides both is just \\(a\\) itself.\n\n**How to check without full factoring**\n\n1. **Identify the smaller number** \u2013 call it\u202f\\(a\\).  \n2. **Test whether the larger number \\(b\\) is divisible by \\(a\\):**  \n   - Perform the division \\(b \\div a\\).  \n   - If the remainder is\u202f0, then \\(b\\) is a multiple of \\(a\\).  \n3. **Conclusion:**  \n   - If the remainder is\u202f0, the GCF =\u202f\\(a\\).  \n   - If the remainder is not\u202f0, then the numbers are not in a simple multiple relationship and you would need another method (e.g., Euclidean algorithm).\n\n**Example**\n\nFind the GCF of\u202f12\u202fand\u202f36.\n\n- The smaller number is 12.  \n- Divide 36 by 12: \\(36 \u00f7 12 = 3\\) with remainder\u202f0.  \n- Since 36 is a multiple of 12, the GCF is **12**.\n\nSo, by simply checking the divisibility of the larger number by the smaller one, you can determine the GCF without having to factor either number completely."

      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) is the largest whole number that divides\u202fboth\u202fnumbers with no remainder.\n\n- The factors of **7** are: 1, **7**.  \n- The factors of **21** are: 1, 3, 7, **7**, 21.\n\nLooking at the two lists, the numbers they share are 1 and **7**.  \nSince **7** is larger than 1, it is the greatest (largest) common factor.\n\nTherefore, the GCF of 7 and 21 is **7**."

      "question": "If the GCF of two numbers is 20 and one of the numbers is 80, what could the other number be?",
      "student_answer": "Since the greatest common factor is 20, the unknown number must be a multiple of\u202f20.  \nWrite the other number as \\(20k\\).  \n\nFor the GCF of \\(80\\) and \\(20k\\) to be exactly 20, the factor \\(k\\) must share **no** common factor with \\(\\dfrac{80}{20}=4\\). In other words, \\(k\\) must be odd (coprime to\u202f4).\n\nSo the other number can be any multiple of 20 whose multiplier is odd:\n\n\\[\n20,\\; 60,\\; 100,\\; 140,\\; 180,\\; \\dots\n\\]\n\nFor example, one possible value is **60** (since \\(\\gcd(80,60)=20\\))."

      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where finding the GCF of a number and its multiple is useful.",
      "student_answer": "A practical situation where you would look for the greatest common factor (GCF) of a number and one of its multiples is when you are trying to pack items into identical containers with no leftovers.\n\n**Example \u2013 Packing snack bags**\n\nSuppose a school cafeteria has **84** granola bars to distribute among the elementary classes, and the teacher wants each class to receive the same number of bars while also using bags that hold a **multiple** of the amount each class gets. The cafeteria can buy pre\u2011made snack bags that come in sizes of\u202f12,\u202f24,\u202f36,\u202f48,\u202f60,\u202f\u2026 bars per bag (each size is a multiple of\u202f12).  \n\nTo find the largest bag size that will allow the 84 bars to be divided evenly among the classes, you calculate the GCF of the total number of bars (84) and the bag size options (which are all multiples of\u202f12).  \n\n- The GCF of 84\u202fand\u202f12 is **12**.  \n- Because 12 is the greatest number that divides both 84 and the bag size, you can choose the 12\u2011bar bag as the largest size that will fill the bags completely without any bars left over.  \n\nUsing the GCF tells the cafeteria the biggest bag they can use so that every bag is completely filled and each class receives the same number of bars, eliminating waste and simplifying the distribution process.\n\n(If you wanted an even larger bag, you would need to increase the total number of bars or pick a different multiple, but the GCF gives you the optimal size given the current numbers.)"
