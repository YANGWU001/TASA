      "student_answer": "The sum \\(8 + 9 = 17\\) and the sum \\(10 + 6 = 16\\).  \nSince \\(17 > 16\\), the larger sum is **8\u202f+\u202f9**."

      "student_answer": "First, find each sum:\n\n- \\(14 + 8 = 22\\)\n- \\(9 + 12 = 21\\)\n\nThe larger of the two sums is **22**, which comes from adding 14 and 8."

      "student_answer": "The sum \\(5 + 6 = 11\\) is larger than the sum \\(7 + 3 = 10\\). So **5\u202f+\u202f6** represents the larger quantity."
