      "question": "A square is divided into 9 equal sections. What shape are the sections?",
      "student_answer": "The square is divided into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, so each of the 9 equal sections is itself a **smaller square**."

      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into 16 equal smaller squares, they are arranged in a 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 grid.  \nSo there are **4 rows and 4 columns** of the smaller squares."

      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into more equal sections, each part becomes smaller \u2013 the area (and side length) of each piece decreases as the number of pieces increases."

      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013 a square can be broken up into triangles that are all the same size.  \n\nThe easiest example is to draw one of the diagonals.  The diagonal splits the square into two congruent right\u2011angled triangles, each having half the area of the original square.  If you draw **both** diagonals, the square is divided into four congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles, each one\u2011fourth of the area.\n\nYou can also get other equal\u2011area triangles by joining the centre of the square to the four vertices; that gives four triangles that are all the same size (though they are not right triangles).  In general, any even number of congruent triangles can be obtained by repeatedly bisecting the pieces you already have.\n\n(One common mistake is to think that a square cannot be divided into an odd number of equal triangles.  That isn\u2019t true if \u201cequal\u201d means \u201cequal area\u201d \u2013 you can, for example, cut a square into three triangles of the same area by drawing a line from one corner to a point that divides the opposite side into a 2\u202f:\u202f1 ratio.  However, creating **congruent** (identical\u2011shaped) triangles is only possible for certain numbers such as 2,\u202f4,\u202f8, \u2026.)\n\nSo a square can definitely be divided into equal triangles; the simplest ways are the one\u2011diagonal (2 triangles) or two\u2011diagonal (4 triangles) constructions."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "Each smaller square will have a side length of  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{\\sqrt{36}}=\\frac{12}{6}=2.\n\\]\n\nSo the side of each of the 36 equal squares is **2 units**."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When we cut a square into several equal pieces, the shape of each piece is determined by how the cuts are made.  \n\nA **square** has two defining properties:  \n\n1. All four sides are the same length.  \n2. All interior angles are right angles (90\u00b0).  \n\nA **rectangle** also has right angles, but its opposite sides are equal while the adjacent sides can be different lengths. In other words, a rectangle only requires that the opposite sides match; it does **not** require all four sides to be equal.\n\nIf we split a square into equal rectangles, the cuts are usually parallel to one pair of sides (horizontal or vertical). This creates pieces whose length (the dimension along the direction of the cut) is longer than their width (the dimension across the cut). Because the two dimensions are unequal, each piece fails the first requirement for being a square \u2013 its sides are not all the same length.  \n\nOnly when the cuts are positioned exactly at the mid\u2011points of the sides (so that the length and width of each piece are the same) do the resulting pieces become squares. Any other division that produces rectangles will give pieces whose length \u2260 width, and therefore those pieces are rectangles, not squares.  \n\nSo, dividing a square into equal rectangles changes the side\u2011length relationship: the pieces keep the right\u2011angle property but lose the \u201call sides equal\u201d property, which is why the parts are rectangles rather than squares."
