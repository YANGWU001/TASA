      "question": "True or False: If one number is a multiple of another, their LCM is always the larger number. Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer: True**\n\n**Justification:**  \nIf one number is a multiple of the other, the larger number is already divisible by the smaller one. The least common multiple (LCM) is defined as the smallest positive integer that both numbers divide into without remainder. Since the larger number already satisfies this condition (it\u2019s divisible by itself and, because it\u2019s a multiple, also divisible by the smaller number), there is no smaller common multiple. Therefore the LCM must be the larger number."
