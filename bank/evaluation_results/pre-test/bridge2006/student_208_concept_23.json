      "student_answer": "The least\u2011common multiple of two integers\u202f\\(a\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(b\\) can be written as  \n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{LCM}(a,b)=\\frac{a\\cdot b}{\\gcd(a,b)} .\n\\]\n\nSo the LCM will be exactly the product\u202f\\(a\\cdot b\\)\u202fwhenever the greatest common divisor is\u202f1.  \nIn other words, if the two numbers share **no** common factor larger than\u202f1 \u2013 they are relatively\nprime (coprime) \u2013 the denominator in the formula is\u202f1 and the fraction reduces to the product\nitself.\n\nFor example, \\(4\\) and\u202f\\(9\\) have \\(\\gcd(4,9)=1\\); therefore  \n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{LCM}(4,9)=\\frac{4\\cdot9}{1}=36,\n\\]\n\nwhich is just the product of the two numbers.\n\nI think that this also happens whenever the numbers are both prime, because primes have no\ncommon factors.\u202fThat\u2019s actually a special case of being coprime \u2013 any pair of numbers that are\nrelatively prime (not just primes) will have their LCM equal to the product."

      "student_answer": "I think the pair **3 and 12 could work**, because their product is  \n\n\\[\n3 \\times 12 = 36,\n\\]\n\nwhich matches the given product, and the least common multiple of 3 and\u202f12 is 12, so that also matches the given LCM.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m a little uncertain about the rule that the LCM has to be larger than *both* numbers. If that were true, then 12 couldn\u2019t be the LCM of 3 and\u202f12 (since one of the numbers is also 12). Because of that, I\u2019m not completely sure if 3 and\u202f12 are acceptable \u2013 they seem to satisfy the numbers we were given, but the \u201clarger\u2011than\u2011both\u201d idea is confusing me. \n\nSo, probably they could be the numbers, but I\u2019m not 100\u202f% confident."

      "student_answer": "I think the least common multiple of\u202f9\u202fand\u202f15 is 45.  \n\n**Why:**  \n- Prime\u2011factor each number:\u202f9\u202f=\u202f3\u00b2,\u202f15\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5.  \n- For the LCM we take each prime factor at its highest power that appears:\u202f3\u00b2\u202fand\u202f5\u00b9.  \n- So LCM\u202f=\u202f3\u00b2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f9\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f45.\n\nThe product of the two numbers is 9\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f135, which is larger than 45. So the LCM is **not** the same as their product; it\u2019s a smaller number that both 9 and 15 divide into evenly."

      "student_answer": "I think the least common multiple of\u202f7\u202fand\u202f5\u202fis 35.  \n\nBecause 7 and 5 have no common factors other than 1 (they\u2019re relatively prime), the smallest number that both of them divide into is just their product:  \n\n\\[\n7 \\times 5 = 35.\n\\]\n\nSo the LCM does match the product. The reason is that when two numbers share no prime factors, the LCM is simply the product of the numbers."

      "student_answer": "I think a simple example is the numbers **3 and\u202f5**.\n\n- The product of the two numbers is \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\).\n- Since 3 and 5 have no common factors other than 1 (they are relatively prime), the smallest number that is a multiple of both of them is just their product. In other words, the least common multiple is \\( \\operatorname{LCM}(3,5) = 15\\).\n\nSo in this case the LCM equals the product because the numbers share no common divisor greater than 1. (If two numbers are relatively prime, their LCM will always be the same as their product.)"

      "student_answer": "I think the LCM of two numbers is only the same as their product when the numbers don\u2019t share any common factors.  \n\nFor example, 3\u202fand\u202f5 are relatively prime, so the LCM(3,\u202f5)\u202f=\u202f15, and 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f15 as well.  \n\nOn the other hand, I\u2019ve also heard that for 4\u202fand\u202f6 the LCM is 24, which happens to be the same as their product\u202f(4\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f24).  \n\nSo, based on these cases, the LCM can be the product in some situations, but not in all."

      "student_answer": "One simple example is the pair **4 and\u202f6**.\n\n- Their product is  \n  \\[\n  4 \\times 6 = 24 .\n  \\]\n\n- Their greatest common divisor is  \n  \\[\n  \\gcd(4,6)=2 .\n  \\]\n\n- The least common multiple can be found from the relationship  \n  \\[\n  \\text{LCM}(a,b)=\\frac{ab}{\\gcd(a,b)} .\n  \\]\n  So  \n  \\[\n  \\text{LCM}(4,6)=\\frac{4 \\times 6}{2}=12 .\n  \\]\n\nSince \\(12 < 24\\), the LCM of 4 and\u202f6 is **less than** their product.\n\n**Why this works:** Whenever two numbers share a common factor greater than\u202f1 (i.e., their GCD\u202f>\u202f1), the LCM equals the product divided by that GCD. Because the division by a number larger than\u202f1 reduces the value, the LCM will be smaller than the product. Any non\u2011coprime pair (like 4\u202f&\u202f6, 8\u202f&\u202f12, 9\u202f&\u202f15, etc.) will give the same situation."

      "student_answer": "The least\u2011common multiple of two numbers is **not** always their product.  \nIt only equals the product when the numbers have no common factor (i.e., when they are relatively prime).  \n\n**For 10 and 15**\n\n1. **Factor each number**  \n   - 10\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5  \n   - 15\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5  \n\n   Both numbers contain the factor\u202f5, so they are **not** relatively prime.\n\n2. **Find the greatest common divisor (GCD)**  \n   The common factor is 5, so GCD(10,\u202f15)\u202f=\u202f5.  \n\n3. **Use the relationship**  \n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(a,b)=\\frac{a\\cdot b}{\\text{GCD}(a,b)}\n\\]\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(10,15)=\\frac{10\\times15}{5}=\\frac{150}{5}=30.\n\\]\n\n4. **Compare with the product**  \n\n\\[\n10\\times15 = 150,\n\\]\n\nwhich is **much larger** than the LCM (30).  \n\n---\n\n### Why the product isn\u2019t the LCM here\n\nBecause 10 and 15 share the factor 5, the product counts that factor twice (once from each number). The LCM should count each prime factor only the greatest number of times it appears in any one of the numbers. So we \u201ccancel\u201d the common factor by dividing the product by the GCD, giving 30 rather than 150.\n\n(If the two numbers had no common factors\u2014for example, 8 and 9\u2014then GCD\u202f=\u202f1 and the LCM would indeed be the product, 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f72.)"
