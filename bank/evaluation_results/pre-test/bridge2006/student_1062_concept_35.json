      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "If a square is divided into 4 equal parts, how many smaller squares are formed?",
      "student_answer": "The square would be split into **4** smaller squares."
    },

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "A square is divided into 9 equal sections. What shape are the sections?",
      "student_answer": "The square is split into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, so each of the nine equal parts is itself a **smaller square**."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into 16 equal smaller squares, they form a 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 grid.  \n\n**Answer:**\u202f4 rows and 4 columns."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "A square is divided into 25 equal parts. How many parts are in each row?",
      "student_answer": "The square is arranged in a 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 grid, so each row contains **5 parts**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is split into more equal sections, each piece must occupy a smaller portion of the whole. In other words, the area (and side length of each sub\u2011square, if the pieces are squares) gets reduced as the number of equal sections increases."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "If a square is divided horizontally and vertically into 4 equal sections, what is the shape of each section?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the four sections is itself a smaller **square**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013 a square can be broken up into equal (congruent) triangles.  \nThe easiest way to see this is to draw one of the two diagonals of the square. The diagonal cuts the square into two right\u2011angled, isosceles triangles that are exactly the same size and shape, so the square has been divided into equal triangles.\n\nBecause a square is a very regular shape, you can also divide it into larger numbers of congruent triangles. For example, you can draw both diagonals to get four congruent right\u2011angled triangles, or draw lines from the centre of the square to each side (or to each corner) to produce four or eight smaller congruent triangles, etc. In each case the pieces are triangles that all have the same area and the same shape.\n\nSo a square does not have to be divided only into smaller squares; it can be tiled by equal triangles as well, simply by using its symmetry and drawing appropriate lines (the diagonal being the simplest illustration)."

      "student_answer": "The square is split into a \\(6 \\times 6\\) grid (since \\(\\sqrt{36}=6\\)).  \nSo each smaller square\u2019s side length is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{6}=2.\n\\]\n\n**Answer: each side of the smaller squares is 2 units long.**"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When you split a square into a number of **equal rectangles**, each piece keeps the same height as the original square but its width is reduced (or its height is reduced if you cut horizontally).  \nBecause a **square** is a special kind of rectangle whose *two sides are exactly the same length*, any shape whose side lengths are different cannot be a square.\n\nFor example, suppose the square has side\u2011length \\(s\\).  \nIf we slice it into three vertical strips, each strip will be a rectangle whose height is still \\(s\\) but whose width is \\(\\dfrac{s}{3}\\). The two dimensions are now \\(s\\) and \\(\\dfrac{s}{3}\\), which are not equal, so each strip is a rectangle, not a square.\n\nIn general, when a square is divided into \\(n\\) equal rectangles (by cutting only in one direction), the resulting pieces have dimensions  \n\n\\[\n\\text{height}=s,\\qquad \\text{width}= \\frac{s}{n}\n\\]\n\nor the reverse if the cut is horizontal. Since \\(\\frac{s}{n}\\neq s\\) for any \\(n>1\\), the pieces cannot satisfy the defining property of a square (equal side lengths).\n\nSo the key reason is that the **aspect ratio** (the ratio of length to width) of each piece changes from 1 (the original square) to \\(n\\) (or \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\)), and a shape with an aspect ratio different from 1 is a rectangle, not a square.  \n\n*(One small slip that sometimes trips people up: the perimeter of each rectangle is **not** the same as the perimeter of the original square; only the area is divided equally.)*"

      "question": "Draw a square divided into 9 equal sections and label the dimensions of each smaller square if the original square has a side length of 3 units.",
      "student_answer": "Here is a simple sketch of the required figure and the dimensions of each of the nine smaller squares.\n\n```\n+---+---+---+\n|   |   |   |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 |\n|   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+\n|   |   |   |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 |\n|   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+\n|   |   |   |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 |\n|   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n\n* The original square has a side length of **3\u202funits**.\n* It is divided into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, giving **9 equal smaller squares**.\n* Because the large side (3\u202funits) is split into three equal parts, each small square has a side length of  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{3\\ \\text{units}}{3}=1\\ \\text{unit}.\n\\]\n\n* Therefore each of the nine smaller squares is a **1\u202funit\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202funit** square, with an area of  \n\n\\[\n1\\ \\text{unit} \\times 1\\ \\text{unit}=1\\ \\text{square unit}.\n\\]\n\nSo every small square is labelled \u201c1\u201d for its side length (and, if needed, its area is 1\u202fsq\u202funit)."
