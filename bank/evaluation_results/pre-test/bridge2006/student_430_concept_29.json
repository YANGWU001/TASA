      "student_answer": "When a number \\(a\\) is multiplied by an integer \\(k\\;(k\\ge 1)\\) we obtain a second number  \n\n\\[\nb = k\\;a .\n\\]\n\nBecause \\(b\\) is just \\(a\\) repeated \\(k\\) times, every divisor of \\(a\\) automatically divides \\(b\\) as well:\n\n* If \\(d\\) is a factor of \\(a\\), then \\(a = d\\;m\\) for some integer \\(m\\).\n* Substituting into \\(b\\) gives \\(b = k\\;a = k(d\\;m) = d\\;(k m)\\),\n  which shows that \\(d\\) also divides \\(b\\).\n\nThus **the set of common factors of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is exactly the set of factors of the smaller number \\(a\\)**.  \nSince the greatest (largest) element of that set is \\(a\\) itself, the greatest common factor (GCF) of the two numbers is the smaller number:\n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{GCF}(a,\\;k a) = a .\n\\]\n\n(If \\(k = 1\\), the two numbers are equal and the GCF is that common value, which is still the \u201csmaller\u201d number because they are the same.)\n\nSo the GCF of a number and any of its multiples is always the smaller number because every divisor of the smaller one automatically divides the larger multiple, making the smaller number the largest common divisor."

      "student_answer": "When one of the two numbers is an exact multiple of the other, the greatest common factor (GCF) is simply the smaller number.  \n\n**Why this works**\n\nIf \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the two numbers and \\(b = k \\times a\\) for some integer \\(k\\), then every divisor of \\(a\\) also divides \\(b\\). Consequently the set of common factors of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is exactly the set of factors of \\(a\\). The largest of those is \\(a\\) itself, so  \n\n\\[\n\\text{GCF}(a,b)=a\\qquad(\\text{when } b \\text{ is a multiple of } a).\n\\]\n\n**How to determine it without full factoring**\n\n1. **Identify the smaller number**: Call it \\(a\\).  \n2. **Check divisibility**: Divide the larger number \\(b\\) by \\(a\\).  \n   - If the remainder is 0, then \\(b\\) is a multiple of \\(a\\) and the GCF is \\(a\\).  \n   - If the remainder is not 0, the larger number isn\u2019t a true multiple; then you\u2019d need to use another method (e.g., Euclidean algorithm) to find the GCF.\n\n**Example**\n\nFind the GCF of 12 and 36.\n\n- The smaller number is 12.  \n- Divide 36 by 12: \\(36 \u00f7 12 = 3\\) with remainder 0.  \n- Because 36 is a multiple of 12, the GCF is **12**.\n\nThus, you can determine the GCF quickly by a simple division test rather than factoring both numbers completely."

      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers is the largest whole number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.\n\n1. **List the factors of each number.**  \n   - Factors of **7**: 1, **7** (7 is a prime number, so it only has these two factors).  \n   - Factors of **21**: 1, 3, **7**, 21.\n\n2. **Identify the common factors.**  \n   The numbers that appear in both lists are **1** and **7**.\n\n3. **Choose the greatest one.**  \n   Between the common factors 1 and 7, the larger (greatest) is **7**.\n\nTherefore, the GCF of 7 and 21 is **7** because it is the largest number that divides both 7 and 21 exactly."

      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where finding the GCF of a number and its multiple is useful.",
      "student_answer": "A practical situation where you would find the greatest common factor (GCF) of a number and one of its multiples is in **planning how to package items without leftovers**.\n\n**Scenario:**  \nA school is buying **48** crayons and wants to place them into identical boxes so that every box contains the same number of crayons and no crayons are left over. The supplier suggests that the crayons could be packed in groups of any size that divides 48 (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48).  \n\nThe school also knows that each box must hold at least **12** crayons because a box that holds fewer would be too small for storage.  \n\nTo decide the largest possible box\u2011size that meets the requirement, you can treat the problem as finding the GCF of the total number of crayons (48) and a multiple of that number that reflects the \u201cat least 12 per box\u201d constraint. Since 12 is a divisor of 48, you can think of 48 as the number and **12\u202f\u00d7\u202fk** (where k is an integer) as the multiple that represents the total capacity needed for the boxes.  \n\nFinding the GCF of 48 and 12\u202f\u00d7\u202fk (for any integer k) tells you the biggest group size that fits both conditions. In this case, the GCF of 48 and 12 is **12**, so the school can pack the crayons in boxes of **12** each, resulting in **4** boxes with no leftovers.\n\n**Why the GCF matters:**  \n- It guarantees that the chosen box size divides the total quantity evenly, avoiding waste.  \n- It helps identify the **largest** feasible group size that satisfies a minimum\u2011size requirement, which often reduces the number of packages needed and simplifies handling.  \n\nThus, using the GCF of a number and one of its multiples is a handy tool for efficient packaging, inventory management, and similar real\u2011world tasks."
