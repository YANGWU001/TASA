      "question": "A square is divided into 9 equal sections. What shape are the sections?",
      "student_answer": "The square is divided into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, so each of the nine equal sections is itself a **smaller square**."

      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into 16 equal smaller squares, the division forms a **4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 grid**.  \n\n- **Rows:** 4  \n- **Columns:** 4  \n\nSo there are 4 rows and 4 columns of the smaller squares."

      "question": "A square is divided into 25 equal parts. How many parts are in each row?",
      "student_answer": "Each row contains **5 parts**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into more equal sections, the total area of the square stays the same, so each individual part must become **smaller**. As the number of equal parts increases, the area (and side length, if the parts are also squares) of each part decreases proportionally."

      "question": "If a square is divided horizontally and vertically into 4 equal sections, what is the shape of each section?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the four sections is itself a smaller **square**."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes. A square can be partitioned into congruent (equal\u2011shaped and equal\u2011area) triangles.\n\nThe simplest way is to draw one of the square\u2019s diagonals.  \nThe diagonal connects opposite corners and splits the square into two right\u2011angled triangles. Each triangle has the same side lengths as the other (the two legs are the sides of the square and the hypotenuse is the diagonal), so the two triangles are congruent and together they fill the entire square without overlap or gaps.\n\nYou can also obtain more equal triangles. For example, drawing **both** diagonals creates four congruent isosceles\u2011right triangles, each with legs equal to half the side of the original square and a common hypotenuse (the diagonal of the original square). Likewise, by further subdividing those triangles (e.g., drawing medians or connecting mid\u2011points), you can produce many sets of identical triangles that still exactly cover the square.\n\nThe reason this works is that a straight line through the square that joins two opposite vertices (or other symmetric points) creates regions that have the same shape and area because the square\u2019s sides and angles are all equal and its symmetry guarantees that the resulting pieces are mirror images of one another. Thus, a square is not limited to being tiled only by smaller squares; it can also be tiled perfectly by equal triangles."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "The 36 equal squares must form a \\(6 \\times 6\\) grid (since \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\)).  \n\nSo each side of a small square is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{side of original square}}{\\text{number of squares along one edge}} \n= \\frac{12}{6}=2.\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** Each smaller square has side length **2** (units)."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is cut into several **equal rectangles**, each piece must share the same height and the same width as every other piece.  \nA square, by definition, has its height equal to its width. If we keep that equality for each piece, the only way to satisfy it is to make the pieces **exactly the same size as the original square** \u2013 i.e., not cut it at all, or cut it into smaller squares (which are still squares, not rectangles).\n\nAny genuine division that creates more than one piece forces at least one dimension of the pieces to be **shorter** than the original side length. Suppose we draw one or more straight cuts parallel to a side of the square:\n\n* If the cuts are parallel to the **top and bottom** edges, each piece will have the full width of the original square but only a fraction of its height.  \n* If the cuts are parallel to the **left and right** edges, each piece will have the full height but only a fraction of the width.\n\nIn either case the resulting piece\u2019s height and width are no longer equal, so its shape is a **rectangle**, not a square.  \n\nOnly when we cut the square both horizontally **and** vertically into a grid of equal smaller squares (e.g., 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2, 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3, \u2026) do we obtain pieces that remain squares. But those pieces are still **squares**, not rectangles.  \n\nTherefore, dividing a square into equal rectangles inevitably changes the aspect ratio of each part, and the parts cannot be squares unless no division occurs or the division is specifically into smaller squares."
