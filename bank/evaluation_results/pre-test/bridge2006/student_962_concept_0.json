  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of comparing multiplication results, correctly identifying larger quantities in most cases. However, they incorrectly stated that the products in Questions 1 and 9 were equal, which indicates a misunderstanding of multiplication results. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the concept.",
