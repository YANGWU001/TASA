      "student_answer": "**How to find the number of equal divisions created by 4 vertical bars in a rectangle**\n\n1. **Visualize the bars** \u2013 Draw (or look at) the rectangle and place the four vertical bars inside it, evenly spaced from the left edge to the right edge.\n\n2. **Count the bars** \u2013 You have **4** distinct vertical lines.\n\n3. **Remember the rule** \u2013\u202fEvery time you add a vertical bar you create **one more division** than the number of bars you already have. In other words, the number of equal sections = *number of bars\u202f+\u202f1*.\n\n4. **Apply the rule** \u2013  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Divisions} = 4\\ (\\text{bars}) + 1 = 5\n   \\]\n\n5. **Check the spacing** \u2013 Verify that the five resulting strips are of equal width. If they are not, adjust the spacing of the bars until each of the five parts has the same width.\n\n6. **Label the divisions (optional)** \u2013 You can label the sections 1 through 5 to make it clear that each region is distinct and equal.\n\n**Result:** Using four vertical bars inside a rectangular shape partitions the rectangle into **five equal vertical divisions**."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain why placing 6 vertical bars in a rectangle results in 7 equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "When we draw vertical bars inside a rectangle, each bar acts as a **boundary** that separates one part of the shape from the next.  \n\n- The very left edge of the rectangle is the start of the first region.  \n- After the first bar we get the second region, after the second bar the third region, and so on.  \n\nIf we place **6** vertical bars, they produce **6** interior boundaries. Counting the regions:\n\n1. The region to the left of the first bar.  \n2. The region between bar\u202f1 and bar\u202f2.  \n3. The region between bar\u202f2 and bar\u202f3.  \n4. The region between bar\u202f3 and bar\u202f4.  \n5. The region between bar\u202f4 and bar\u202f5.  \n6. The region between bar\u202f5 and bar\u202f6.  \n7. The region to the right of the sixth bar (up to the right edge of the rectangle).\n\nThus the number of **equal divisions** (or sections) is always one more than the number of vertical bars placed, because the outermost edges of the rectangle also count as boundaries. Therefore, 6 vertical bars give **7 equal divisions**."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How does the number of vertical bars relate to the total number of equal divisions in a given shape?",
      "student_answer": "The vertical bars are the visual markers that show where a shape has been split into equal parts.  \nEach bar represents a boundary between two neighboring sections, so **the number of vertical bars you see is the same as the total number of equal divisions** the shape has been divided into.\n\n- If a rectangle has **3 vertical bars**, it is divided into **3 equal vertical strips**.  \n- If there are **5 bars**, the shape is split into **5 equal parts**, and so on.\n\nIn short, count the vertical bars and you\u2019ll know immediately how many equal sections the shape contains. (Sometimes a teacher may draw an extra bar at the far edge of the shape for emphasis, but the intended number of divisions is still the count of interior bars.)"

      "student_answer": "The rectangle is split into 8 equal sections.  \nTo create *n* equal vertical sections you need **n\u202f\u2212\u202f1** vertical bars (each bar separates two adjacent sections).  \n\nSo for 8 sections:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of vertical bars} = 8 - 1 = 7\n\\]\n\n**Answer: 7 vertical bars**."

      "student_answer": "**Example**\n\nImagine a plain square that is\u202f10\u202fcentimetres on each side.  \nNow draw **10 vertical bars** inside the square so that they are **evenly spaced** from the left edge to the right edge.\n\n| Step | What you do | Result |\n|------|--------------|--------|\n| 1\ufe0f\u20e3 | Mark the left side of the square as the starting line (\u202f0\u202fcm). | \u2013 |\n| 2\ufe0f\u20e3 | Divide the total width (10\u202fcm) by **11** (the number of spaces created by 10 bars).  <br>10\u202fcm \u00f7 11\u202f\u2248\u202f0.91\u202fcm. | Each spacing will be \u2248\u202f0.91\u202fcm wide. |\n| 3\ufe0f\u20e3 | Starting at 0\u202fcm, draw the first vertical bar at\u202f0.91\u202fcm, the second at\u202f1.82\u202fcm, the third at\u202f2.73\u202fcm, \u2026 and continue until the tenth bar is placed at\u202f9.09\u202fcm. | The square now contains **10 vertical bars** that cut it into **11 equal vertical strips**. |\n| 4\ufe0f\u20e3 | (Optional) Add a few horizontal bars in the same way to create a grid. | Each small rectangle in the grid is identical in size. |\n\n**What this looks like**\n\n```\n| | | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | |\n```\n\nThe 10 vertical lines (the \u201cbars\u201d) split the square into 11 vertical sections. Because the bars are spaced **exactly the same distance apart**, every section has the **same width** (\u2248\u202f0.91\u202fcm) and the same height (the full 10\u202fcm of the square).  \n\nThus, by placing 10 equally\u2011spaced vertical bars inside a square, you create **multiple equal divisions**\u2014specifically, 11 equal parts. If you also add horizontal bars, each intersection forms a tiny rectangle that is identical to all the others, giving you even more equal divisions throughout the square."
