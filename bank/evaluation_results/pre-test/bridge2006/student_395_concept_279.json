      "question": "What is the difference between negative integers and positive integers on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "On a usual horizontal number line, **zero** sits right in the middle.  \n\n- **Negative integers** are the whole\u2011number points **to the left of zero** (\u2026\u202f\u20113,\u202f\u20112,\u202f\u20111). Their values are less than\u202f0, and moving farther left means the numbers get \u201cmore negative.\u201d  \n\n- **Positive integers** are the whole\u2011number points **to the right of zero** (1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f\u2026). Their values are greater than\u202f0, and moving farther right means the numbers get larger.  \n\nSo the main difference is their **position relative to zero** and the **sign of the numbers**: negatives lie left of zero and represent values below zero, while positives lie right of zero and represent values above zero."
