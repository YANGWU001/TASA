  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of rewriting expressions with negative integers and the equivalence to subtraction. However, there are some misconceptions, particularly in Question 6 and Question 8, where the student incorrectly states that adding a negative integer makes the number larger. Overall, the student shows good reasoning and justification in their explanations.",

      "question": "Explain why adding a negative integer is equivalent to subtraction.",
      "student_answer": "Adding a negative integer works just like subtraction because the negative sign tells you to move in the opposite direction on the number line.\u202fFor example,\u202f\\(7+(-4)\\) means you start at\u202f7\u202fand then go\u202f4\u202funits to the left, which lands you at\u202f3.\u202fThat is exactly the same result you would get by doing\u202f\\(7-4=3\\).\u202fSo \u201cadding\u202f\\(-4\\)\u201d is really just a shorthand way of \u201csubtracting\u202f4\u201d.\n\nI think the reason this works is that a negative number represents a loss or a decrease, and when you add a loss you\u2019re actually taking something away.\u202fThat\u2019s why the two operations give the same answer.\n\n(But I\u2019m a little unsure about whether this rule always makes the result smaller \u2013 I guess if you start with a negative number and add a negative, the result can actually become more negative, which feels like it\u2019s \u201cadding\u201d rather than \u201csubtracting.\u201d)"

      "student_answer": "I think there is a difference. When you **add a negative integer**, you\u2019re actually making the number **larger** (because you\u2019re adding a \u201cminus\u201d sign), whereas when you **subtract a positive integer** you\u2019re making the number **smaller**. So, adding a negative and subtracting a positive don\u2019t behave the same way."

Start with\u202f20.  \n2. Add the opposite of\u202f15 (that is, add\u202f\u221215).  \n3. Adding\u202f\u221215 is equivalent to taking away\u202f15, i.e., \\(20 - 15\\).  \n4. Performing the subtraction gives \\(5\\).\n\nThus, rewriting \\(20 + (-15)\\) as \\(20 - 15\\) is justified, and the result is **5**."
