      "question": "Describe how you would divide a circle into 5 equal sections.",
      "student_answer": "To split a circle into five equal parts you need each sector to have the same central angle.  \nSince a full circle is\u202f360\u00b0, each of the five angles must be  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{360^\\circ}{5}=72^\\circ .\n\\]\n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step method (using a protractor):**\n\n1. **Draw the circle** and mark its centre\u202f\\(O\\).  \n2. **Draw a radius** from \\(O\\) to any point on the circumference; label the outer point \\(A\\).  \n3. **Place the protractor** with its centre hole over \\(O\\) and the baseline aligned with \\(OA\\).  \n4. **Mark a point** on the circle at\u202f72\u00b0 clockwise from \\(A\\); label this point \\(B\\).  \n5. **Draw the radius** \\(OB\\).  \n6. **Repeat** the process: from \\(OB\\) measure another 72\u00b0 clockwise, mark point \\(C\\) on the circumference, and draw \\(OC\\).  \n7. Continue until you have marked points \\(D\\) and \\(E\\) (each 72\u00b0 apart) and drawn the radii \\(OD\\) and \\(OE\\).  \n\nWhen you finish, the circle is divided into five congruent sectors (triangles with vertex at \\(O\\) and bases \\(AB\\), \\(BC\\), \\(CD\\), \\(DE\\), and \\(EA\\)).  \n\n**Alternative construction (no protractor):**  \n\n1. Draw a regular pentagon inside the circle (using a compass and straightedge).  \n2. Connect the centre of the circle to each vertex of the pentagon.  \n3. The five radii you just drew automatically divide the circle into five equal 72\u00b0 sectors, because the central angles subtended by the sides of a regular pentagon are all 72\u00b0.  \n\nEither approach gives five equal divisions of the circle."

      "question": "Explain the process of dividing a circle into equal sections and calculate the angle for 9 divisions.",
      "student_answer": "To split a circle into **equal sections** you use the fact that the total angle around the centre of a circle is\u202f360\u00b0.  \n\n1. **Decide how many parts you need** (the divisor\u202f\\(n\\)).  \n2. **Find the size of each central angle** by dividing the full angle by the number of parts:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{central angle}=\\frac{360^{\\circ}}{n}\n\\]\n\n3. Starting at any point on the circumference, draw a radius (a line from the centre to the edge).  \n4. From that radius, measure the central angle you just calculated (with a protractor, a set\u2011square, or by \u201cstepping\u201d the angle with a compass).  \n5. Draw the next radius at the end of that measured angle.  \n6. Repeat the measurement and drawing until you return to the starting point.  \n7. The radii you have drawn divide the circle into \\(n\\) equal \u201cslices\u201d.\n\n---\n\n### Example: 9 equal divisions\n\nFor \\(n = 9\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{central angle}= \\frac{360^{\\circ}}{9}=40^{\\circ}\n\\]\n\nSo each of the 9 sections has a central angle of **about\u202f40\u202fdegrees**.  \n\n(You can check the work by multiplying back: \\(9 \\times 40^{\\circ}=360^{\\circ}\\), which matches the full circle.)"
