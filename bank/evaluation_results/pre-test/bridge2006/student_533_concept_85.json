      "question": "What is the contextual meaning of 'difference' when comparing two values?",
      "student_answer": "The \u201cdifference\u201d between two numbers is the amount by which they are not the same \u2013 i.e., how much one value exceeds or falls short of the other. In a contextual setting this is usually found by subtracting one value from the other (\u202f\\( \\text{difference}=A-B\\)\u202f).  \n\n- **Signed difference** (\u202f\\(A-B\\)\u202f) tells you not only the size of the gap but also which value is larger (a positive result means\u202f\\(A\\)\u202fis bigger, a negative result means\u202f\\(B\\)\u202fis bigger).  \n- **Absolute (or magnitude) difference** (\u202f\\(|A-B|\\)\u202f) is often used when only the size of the gap matters, regardless of direction.\n\nThus, when we compare two values, the \u201cdifference\u201d conveys the quantitative gap between them and helps us understand how much one value changes relative to the other."

      "question": "Explain how you would calculate the difference between two temperatures measured in Celsius.",
      "student_answer": "To find the difference between two temperatures that are both given in degrees Celsius, you simply subtract one reading from the other.  \n\n1. **Write down the two temperatures.**  \n   For example, let\u202f\\(T_1 = 23^\\circ\\text{C}\\) and\u202f\\(T_2 = 12^\\circ\\text{C}\\).\n\n2. **Subtract the smaller value from the larger value (or subtract in any order and then take the absolute value).**  \n   \\[\n   \\Delta T = |T_1 - T_2|\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate:**  \n   \\[\n   \\Delta T = |23 - 12| = |11| = 11^\\circ\\text{C}\n   \\]\n\nThe result,\u202f\\(\\Delta T\\), tells you how many degrees Celsius the two temperatures differ by.  \n\nBecause the Celsius scale is an interval scale (the size of one degree is the same everywhere), you do **not** need to convert to any other units before subtracting\u2014just straight subtraction (or absolute\u2011value subtraction) gives you the correct temperature difference."
