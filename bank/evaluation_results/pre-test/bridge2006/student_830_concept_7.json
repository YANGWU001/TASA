  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of comparing sums, but there are several incorrect answers indicating a need for more practice with addition. Specifically, they miscalculated or misjudged the comparisons in questions 1, 2, 5, and 8. Continued practice with addition and careful comparison of sums will help improve accuracy.",
