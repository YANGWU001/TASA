Continue until you have drawn 9 radii; the last one will meet the starting line, completing the circle.\n5. **Check your work** \u2013 The sum of all the marked angles should add up to 360\u00b0, and you should have 9 identical \u201cpie\u2011slice\u201d sectors.\n\n**Angle for 9 equal divisions**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Angle per division} = \\frac{360^\\circ}{9} = 40^\\circ\n\\]\n\nSo each of the nine sections has a central angle of **40 degrees**. By drawing nine radii that are each 40\u00b0 apart, the circle is divided into nine equal parts."
