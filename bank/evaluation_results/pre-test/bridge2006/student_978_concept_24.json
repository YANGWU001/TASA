For example, take 4 and 12: 12 is a multiple of 4, but the LCM of 4 and 12 is 12\u202f\u2014\u202fwhich is the larger number, showing that the LCM can be different from the larger one.

Actually, 21\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f3 and 21\u202f\u00f7\u202f21\u202f=\u202f1.  \n\nSince 21 is divisible by both 7 and 21, and there is no smaller positive number that works, the LCM of 7 and 21 is **21**, not 7."

      "student_answer": "The least\u2011common multiple of 15 and 45 is **45**.\n\nBecause 45\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f15, 45 is already a multiple of 15. When one number is a multiple of the other, the larger number automatically contains all the prime factors needed for the smaller one, so the LCM is just the larger number. This saves us from having to list out all the multiples or do a full prime\u2011factor comparison."
