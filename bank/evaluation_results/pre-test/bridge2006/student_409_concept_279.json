      "question": "Explain how you can identify a negative integer on a number line.",
      "student_answer": "To spot a negative integer on a number line, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Locate the Zero\u202f(0).**  \n   Zero is the central point that separates positive numbers (to the right) from negative numbers (to the left).\n\n2. **Look to the Left of Zero.**  \n   Everything that lies **to the left** of the zero marker is negative. As you move farther left, the values become smaller (\u20111, \u20112, \u20113, \u2026).\n\n3. **Check the Markings.**  \n   The tick marks are usually numbered at regular intervals. Any tick marked with a minus sign (e.g.,\u202f\u20114) indicates a negative integer.\n\n4. **Confirm it\u2019s an Integer.**  \n   An integer has no fractional part. On the line, this means the point sits exactly on one of the numbered tick marks (\u20111, \u20112, \u20113, etc.), not between them.\n\n**Quick Test:**  \n- If a point is **right** of zero \u2192 it\u2019s **positive** (or zero).  \n- If a point is **on** zero \u2192 it\u2019s **zero** (neither positive nor negative).  \n- If a point is **left** of zero \u2192 it\u2019s a **negative integer** (provided it lands on a numbered tick).\n\nSo, by simply seeing whether the point is left of zero and matches a whole\u2011number label, you can reliably identify a negative integer on the number line."

      "question": "What is the difference between negative integers and positive integers on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "On a standard left\u2011to\u2011right number line, **positive integers** are the whole numbers that lie to the right of zero (\u2026,\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f\u2026). They increase as you move farther right, and each positive integer is greater than zero.\n\n**Negative integers** are the whole numbers that lie to the left of zero (\u2026,\u202f\u20113,\u202f\u20112,\u202f\u20111). They decrease as you move farther left, and each negative integer is less than zero.\n\nSo the key differences are:\n\n| Feature | Positive Integers | Negative Integers |\n|---------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Position on the line | Right of 0 | Left of 0 |\n| Sign | No minus sign (or \u201c+\u201d sign) | Have a minus sign (\u2011) |\n| Value relative to 0 | Greater than 0 | Less than 0 |\n| Ordering | Increases as you move right (1\u202f\u2192\u202f2\u202f\u2192\u202f3\u2026) | Decreases as you move left (\u20111\u202f\u2192\u202f\u20112\u202f\u2192\u202f\u20113\u2026) |\n\nIn summary, positive integers are the numbers greater than zero on the right side of the number line, while negative integers are the numbers less than zero on the left side."
