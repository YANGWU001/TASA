      "student_answer": "The product \\(3 \\times 9 = 27\\).\n\nThe product \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\).\n\nSince \\(27 > 24\\), the larger product is **\\(3 \\times 9\\)**."

      "student_answer": "Both products are the same.\n\n- \\(15 \\times 2 = 30\\)  \n- \\(10 \\times 3 = 30\\)\n\nSince each multiplication results in 30, neither product is larger; they are equal."
