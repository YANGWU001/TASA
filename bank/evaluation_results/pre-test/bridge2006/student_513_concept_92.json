      "student_answer": "A whole\u2011number lower bound for a quantity is the biggest whole number (integer\u202f\u2265\u202f0) that is **still less than or equal to** that quantity. In other words, it is the integer you can be sure does not go over the actual value, while any larger integer might be too big.\n\nFor example, if a measurement is 7.3, the whole\u2011number lower bound is 7, because 7 \u2264\u202f7.3 but 8 would already exceed the measurement. The lower bound \u201cgrounds\u201d the value from below using only whole numbers."

      "question": "What role does rounding play when determining the whole number lower bound of a number?",
      "student_answer": "Rounding is the tool we use to \u201cshrink\u201d a number to the nearest whole\u2011number that does not exceed the original value.  \nWhen we look for the **whole\u2011number lower bound** of a number, we round the number **down** (or take its integer part). This gives the greatest integer that is still \u2264 the original number, guaranteeing that the bound is never larger than the number we are approximating.\n\nIn practice:\n\n* If the number is already an integer, rounding does nothing\u2014the lower bound is that same integer.  \n* If the number has a fractional part, we discard (or round down) the fraction, leaving the integer part as the lower bound.\n\nThus, rounding down provides the safe, smallest whole\u2011number estimate that still lies beneath (or exactly at) the given value."

      "student_answer": "The **whole\u2011number lower bound** of a real number is the greatest integer that is **less than or equal to** that number.  \nIn other words, it is the \u201cfloor\u2019\u2019 of the number.\n\nThe **ceiling** of a real number is the smallest integer that is **greater than or equal to** that number.\n\nThus, the lower bound rounds the number **down** to the nearest integer, while the ceiling rounds it **up** to the nearest integer.\n\n**Example**\n\nTake the number \\(7.3\\).\n\n* Whole\u2011number lower bound (floor): \\(\\displaystyle\\lfloor 7.3\\rfloor = 7\\) \u2013 the greatest integer not exceeding 7.3.  \n* Ceiling: \\(\\displaystyle\\lceil 7.3\\rceil = 8\\) \u2013 the smallest integer that is at least 7.3.\n\nSo, the lower bound gives 7, whereas the ceiling gives 8. The two operations produce different results whenever the original number is not already an integer."
