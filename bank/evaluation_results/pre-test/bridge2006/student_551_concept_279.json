  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of negative integers and their identification on a number line. Most answers are correct, indicating a solid grasp of the concepts. The only error was in Question 2, where the student incorrectly identified the integer two places to the left of -3. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the topic.",

      "student_answer": "**Answer: True**\n\n-7 lies to the left of zero on the number line, so it is less than zero. Any integer that is less than zero is classified as a negative integer. Hence, -7 is indeed a negative integer."

      "question": "Explain how you can identify a negative integer on a number line.",
      "student_answer": "To spot a negative integer on a number line, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Locate the zero point.**  \n   Zero (0) is the central reference; it separates the positive side (right) from the negative side (left).\n\n2. **Identify the direction.**  \n   Any point that lies **to the left of zero** is a negative number. The farther left you go, the larger (in absolute value) the negative integer becomes.\n\n3. **Check the tick marks.**  \n   Number lines are usually marked with evenly spaced ticks that are labeled with consecutive integers:\n   - The first tick left of zero is **\u20111**.  \n   - The next tick left is **\u20112**, then **\u20113**, and so on.\n\n4. **Confirm the integer label.**  \n   If the point aligns exactly with one of those labeled ticks (\u20111, \u20112, \u20113, \u2026), it is a **negative integer**. If it falls between ticks, it represents a non\u2011integer (e.g., a fraction or decimal), not a negative integer.\n\n5. **Quick visual cue.**  \n   In many diagrams the negative side is shaded or colored differently; use that visual cue to reinforce that any labeled tick on that side is negative.\n\n**Summary:** A negative integer is any whole\u2011number point that sits on a labeled tick **left of zero** on the number line. The sequence proceeds \u2026,\u202f\u20113,\u202f\u20112,\u202f\u20111,\u202f0,\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3, \u2026, so simply look for the labeled marks to the left of zero."

      "question": "What is the difference between negative integers and positive integers on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "Negative integers and positive integers occupy opposite sides of the number line:\n\n- **Negative integers** are the whole numbers that lie **to the left of zero**.  They represent values that are **less than\u202f0** (e.g.,\u202f\u20111,\u202f\u20112,\u202f\u20113, \u2026).  On the number line they are marked with a minus sign (\u2011) and increase in magnitude as you move farther left.\n\n- **Positive integers** are the whole numbers that lie **to the right of zero**.  They represent values that are **greater than\u202f0** (e.g.,\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3, \u2026).  On the number line they are marked with a plus sign (+) or no sign at all and increase as you move farther right.\n\nIn short, the key difference is their position relative to zero: negatives are left of zero (values <\u202f0) and positives are right of zero (values >\u202f0)."
