  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of fractions associated with parts of a square. Most answers are correct, indicating a clear grasp of how to express fractions based on the division of a square. However, in Question 8, the final fraction of unshaded parts was incorrectly simplified, leading to an incorrect answer. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the topic.",

      "student_answer": "Each of the four equal parts makes up one\u2011fourth of the whole square, so each part represents the fraction  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4}\n\\]"

      "question": "How can you express one-third of a square if it is divided into 3 equal parts?",
      "student_answer": "One\u2011third of the square is simply the fraction  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nof the whole. When the square is divided into\u202f3 equal pieces, each piece represents \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the total area, so shading one piece shows \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the square."

      "student_answer": "The square has 12 equal parts. If 4 parts are shaded, the remaining unshaded parts are  \n\n\\[\n12 - 4 = 8 \\text{ parts}.\n\\]\n\nSo the fraction of the square that is unshaded is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{8}{12} = \\frac{2}{3}.\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{2}{3}\\)."
