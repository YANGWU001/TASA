      "student_answer": "The least\u2011common multiple (LCM) of two integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is the smallest positive number that is a multiple of both.  \nA useful relationship that connects the LCM with the greatest common divisor (GCD) is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{a\\;b \\;=\\; \\operatorname{gcd}(a,b)\\;\\times\\;\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)} .\n\\]\n\nFrom this formula we can see when the LCM will equal the product \\(a b\\).\n\n*If the two numbers have no common divisor larger than 1* (i.e., they are **relatively prime** or **coprime**), then  \n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{gcd}(a,b)=1 .\n\\]\n\nPlugging \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(a,b)=1\\) into the relationship gives  \n\n\\[\na b = 1 \\times \\operatorname{lcm}(a,b) \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad \\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)=a b .\n\\]\n\nSo whenever \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) share no prime factors, their LCM is simply their product.\n\n---\n\n### Why this happens in terms of prime factorisation\nWrite each number as a product of prime powers:\n\n\\[\na = p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\\dots p_k^{e_k},\\qquad\nb = p_1^{f_1}p_2^{f_2}\\dots p_k^{f_k},\n\\]\n\nwhere an exponent may be zero if that prime does not appear in the factorisation.  \n\n* The **GCD** takes the **minimum** exponent for each prime: \\(\\displaystyle \\operatorname{gcd}(a,b)=p_1^{\\min(e_1,f_1)}\\dots p_k^{\\min(e_k,f_k)}\\).\n* The **LCM** takes the **maximum** exponent for each prime: \\(\\displaystyle \\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)=p_1^{\\max(e_1,f_1)}\\dots p_k^{\\max(e_k,f_k)}\\).\n\nIf the numbers are coprime, for every prime at most one of the exponents is non\u2011zero, so \\(\\min(e_i,f_i)=0\\) and \\(\\max(e_i,f_i)=e_i\\) or \\(f_i\\). Consequently the product of the two numbers (which multiplies all the exponents) coincides with the LCM, because there is no \u201coverlap\u2019\u2019 that would be removed by the GCD.\n\n---\n\n### Example\n\\(8 = 2^3\\) and \\(15 = 3 \\times 5 = 3^1 5^1\\) share no common prime factors.\n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{gcd}(8,15)=1,\\qquad\n\\operatorname{lcm}(8,15)=2^3\\cdot3^1\\cdot5^1 = 120,\n\\]\nand indeed \\(8 \\times 15 = 120\\).\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\nThe LCM of two numbers equals their product **exactly when the numbers are relatively prime** (i.e., their GCD is\u202f1). In every other case the LCM will be a proper divisor of the product because the common factors are \u201ccounted only once\u2019\u2019 in the LCM."

The LCM only needs the highest power of each distinct prime factor, so it \u201cdrops\u201d the redundant common factor (the extra factor of 3 in this case).

      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of **both** numbers.  \nWhen the two numbers share a common factor, the LCM will be **smaller** than the product, because the product \u201cdouble\u2011counts\u2019\u2019 that common factor.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Prime\u2011factor the numbers  \n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n10 &= 2 \\times 5 \\\\\n15 &= 3 \\times 5\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nBoth numbers contain the factor **5**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Form the LCM  \n\nTo get the LCM we take each prime factor the **maximum** number of times it appears in either factorisation:\n\n*\u202f2\u202fappears once in 10 and not at all in 15 \u2192 keep one 2.  \n*\u202f3\u202fappears once in 15 and not at all in 10 \u2192 keep one 3.  \n*\u202f5\u202fappears once in each \u2192 keep **one** 5 (the maximum exponent is 1).\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}=2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 30\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 3. Compare with the product  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Product}=10 \\times 15 = 150\n\\]\n\nBecause the factor 5 is common to both numbers, the product counts it **twice** (once from each number). The LCM counts it only once, so the LCM is smaller:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{LCM}(10,15)=30 \\neq 150}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 4. Quick check with the GCD formula  \n\nThe relationship  \n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(a,b)=\\frac{a\\;b}{\\gcd(a,b)}\n\\]\n\nalso shows why the product is too big.  \nThe greatest common divisor (GCD) of 10 and 15 is 5:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}= \\frac{10 \\times 15}{5}= \\frac{150}{5}=30.\n\\]\n\nDividing the product by the GCD removes the duplicated common factor, leaving the true LCM.\n\n---\n\n**Therefore, the LCM of 10 and 15 is 30, not 150, because the two numbers share the factor 5, and the product counts that factor twice while the LCM counts it only once.**"
