      "question": "Describe how you would divide a circle into 5 equal sections.",
      "student_answer": "To split a circle into five equal parts you need five central angles of the same size.  \nSince a full circle measures 360\u00b0, each of the five angles must be  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{360^\\circ}{5}=72^\\circ .\n\\]\n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step method**\n\n1. **Draw the circle and its centre** \u2013 Mark point\u202fO as the centre and draw a radius \\(OA\\) to any point A on the circumference. This will be the first dividing line.\n\n2. **Set the angle** \u2013 Using a protractor (or a set\u2011square with a 72\u00b0 setting), place the centre of the protractor at O with the baseline aligned with OA.\n\n3. **Mark the next point** \u2013 Measure 72\u00b0 clockwise (or counter\u2011clockwise) from OA and place a small mark on the circumference; call this point B. Draw the radius \\(OB\\).  \n\n4. **Repeat** \u2013 From OB repeat the 72\u00b0 measurement to locate point C and draw \\(OC\\). Continue the process to locate points D and E, each spaced 72\u00b0 apart.\n\n5. **Check** \u2013 After drawing the fifth radius \\(OE\\), you should have five radii (OA,\u202fOB,\u202fOC,\u202fOD,\u202fOE) that together make a full 360\u00b0, confirming the sections are equal.\n\n**Alternative geometric construction (no protractor)**  \n\n1. Draw a regular pentagon inside the circle:  \n   - Pick any point A on the circumference.  \n   - With the same compass width (the radius), step around the circle, marking points B, C, D, and E, each at the same distance from the previous point.  \n   - Connect consecutive points (AB, BC, CD, DE, EA). The five vertices lie on the circle, forming a regular pentagon.  \n\n2. Draw lines from the centre O to each vertex (OA, OB, OC, OD, OE). Those five radii automatically divide the circle into five equal 72\u00b0 sectors.\n\nEither approach gives five congruent circular segments, each representing one\u2011fifth of the whole circle."
