      "question": "Explain how the GCF helps in dividing items into equal groups.",
      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) is the largest number that can go into **both** quantities without leaving a remainder, so it tells us the biggest size we can use when we want to split the items into equal groups.\n\nFor example, if we have 12 apples and 18 oranges and we want to make the same\u2011size fruit baskets that contain only apples or only oranges, we look for the GCF of 12 and 18.  \nThe GCF is 6, so we could make baskets that each hold 6 pieces of fruit. That means we could have  \n\n* 12 \u00f7 6 = 2 baskets of apples, and  \n* 18 \u00f7 6 = 3 baskets of oranges.  \n\nBecause the GCF is the largest common divisor, using it gives us the fewest possible baskets (the biggest groups) while still keeping the groups equal and with no leftovers.\n\nI think the GCF also works by adding the two numbers together and then dividing by the GCF, but the main idea is that it shows the biggest group size that can be used for both sets of items so they can be divided evenly. (If I\u2019m remembering correctly, sometimes we also look at the sum of the numbers, but the key point is the divisor part.)"

      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor of 45 and\u202f60 is **15**.  \nSo the two totals can be split into groups that each contain **15 items**.  \n\nThat would give you  \n* 45\u202f\u00f7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f3 groups from the 45\u2011item set, and  \n* 60\u202f\u00f7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f4 groups from the 60\u2011item set.  \n\n(So each group has 15 items; there are 3 such groups of the 45 items and 4 groups of the 60 items.)"

      "student_answer": "A common everyday example is when you want to make identical \u201csnack packs\u2019\u2019 for a school class.  \nSuppose you have  \n\n* 48 small chocolate bars, and  \n* 60 packets of crackers.  \n\nYou want each snack pack to contain the same number of chocolate bars **and** the same number of crackers, with no leftovers.  \n\nFirst find the greatest common factor of the two quantities:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{GCF}(48,60)=12\n\\]\n\nBecause the GCF is 12, you can divide both items into 12 equal groups.  \nEach group (or snack pack) will then contain  \n\n* \\(48 \u00f7 12 = 4\\) chocolate bars, and  \n* \\(60 \u00f7 12 = 5\\) packets of crackers.  \n\nSo the GCF tells you the maximum number of identical snack packs you can make without any bars or crackers left over, and it also tells you how many of each item go in every pack. This kind of reasoning is useful for any situation where you need to divide several supplies into the largest possible identical groups\u2014like arranging chairs in rows, packing tool kits, or creating party favor bags."

(For example, you could make 6 groups of 12 from 72, or 7\u202f\u00bd groups of 12 from 90, although the \u201c\u00bd\u201d group would just show that 12 isn\u2019t perfect for 90.)"
