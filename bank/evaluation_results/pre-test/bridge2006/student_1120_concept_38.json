This will be the first dividing line.\n\n3. **Mark the first \\(72^\\circ\\) angle.**  \n   Place the point of a protractor at \\(O\\) with the baseline aligned with \\(OA\\).  \n   Measure \\(72^\\circ\\) clockwise (or counter\u2011clockwise) and make a small tick on the protractor.  \n   Draw a second radius \\(OB\\) through that tick.\n\n4. **Repeat the measurement.**  \n   Keeping the protractor centered at \\(O\\) and the baseline now aligned with \\(OB\\), measure another \\(72^\\circ\\) and draw radius \\(OC\\).\n\n5. **Continue until five radii are drawn.**  \n   Perform the same step two more times, producing radii \\(OD\\) and \\(OE\\).  \n   After the fifth step you will have returned to the original line \\(OA\\), confirming the circle is now divided into five equal sectors.\n\n6. **(Optional) Draw the sector arcs.**  \n   If you need the actual wedge shapes, you can connect the points where each radius meets the circle (A,\u202fB,\u202fC,\u202fD,\u202fE) with the centre O, forming five congruent sectors.\n\n**Result:** The circle is now partitioned into five equal sections, each sector having a central angle of \\(72^\\circ\\) and the same area."

      "student_answer": "**How to divide a circle into equal sections**\n\n1. **Understand what \u201cequal sections\u201d means**  \n   \u2013 A circle has a total of\u202f360\u00b0 (or\u202f2\u03c0\u202fradians) around its center.  \n   \u2013 If you want the circle split into *n* equal parts, each part must have the same central angle.\n\n2. **Find the size of one central angle**  \n   \u2013 Use the formula  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Central angle} = \\frac{360^\\circ}{n}\\qquad\\text{(or } \\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\text{ radians)}\n\\]\n\n   \u2013 This tells you how far to rotate the radius each time you draw a new line from the centre.\n\n3. **Draw the first radius**  \n   \u2013 Pick any point on the circumference and draw a straight line (radius) from the centre to that point.  \n   \u2013 This line is your \u201cstarting line.\u201d\n\n4. **Mark off the angles**  \n   \u2013 From the centre, measure the central angle you just calculated (using a protractor or a compass\u2011based method) and draw the next radius.  \n   \u2013 Continue measuring the same angle from the tip of the last radius and draw the next line.  \n   \u2013 Keep repeating until you have drawn *n* radii. The final radius will line up with the starting line, closing the circle.\n\n5. **Check your work**  \n   \u2013 Count the number of sections; you should have exactly *n*.  \n   \u2013 Verify that the sum of all central angles equals 360\u00b0 (or 2\u03c0\u202fradians).\n\n---\n\n### Example: 9 equal divisions\n\n1. **Number of sections, n = 9**  \n2. **Calculate the central angle**  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Central angle} = \\frac{360^\\circ}{9} = 40^\\circ\n\\]\n\n   (In radians: \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{9} \\approx 0.698\\)\u202frad.)\n\n3. **Procedure**  \n   \u2013 Draw the first radius.  \n   \u2013 From the centre, mark a 40\u00b0 sweep and draw the second radius.  \n   \u2013 Repeat the 40\u00b0 sweep eight more times. After the ninth sweep you return to the starting line.\n\n**Result:** Each of the 9 sectors has a central angle of **40\u00b0**, so the circle is evenly divided into nine equal parts."
