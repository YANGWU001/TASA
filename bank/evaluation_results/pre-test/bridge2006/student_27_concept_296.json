      "question": "What does the 'Select Multiply' rule require you to do when solving equations?",
      "student_answer": "The **Select\u202fMultiply** rule tells you to **pick a number (usually the reciprocal of a coefficient or a common denominator) and multiply\u202fboth sides of the equation by that number**.  \nDoing so preserves the equality while removing fractions or scaling the terms so the variable can be isolated more easily. In short, you multiply the entire left\u2011hand side and the entire right\u2011hand side by the same factor to simplify the equation."

      "question": "Explain the purpose of using the 'Multiply' operation when applying the Select Multiply rule.",
      "student_answer": "The **Select\u202fMultiply** rule is used when we need to combine (multiply) the numeric coefficients of the terms that have been selected by a preceding \u201cSelect\u201d step.  \n\nWhen the rule is applied, the \u201cSelect\u201d part first identifies which parts of an expression are relevant (e.g., certain variables, constants, or sub\u2011expressions). Once those pieces are isolated, the **Multiply** operation takes the coefficients of those selected pieces and multiplies them together. The result becomes the overall coefficient (or scaling factor) that is applied to the combined term in the final expression.\n\nIn short, the purpose of the Multiply operation in the Select\u202fMultiply rule is to:\n\n1. **Aggregate the selected coefficients** into a single product.  \n2. **Scale the combined term** appropriately, preserving the mathematical relationship dictated by the original expression.  \n3. **Simplify the expression** by collapsing multiple selected factors into one multiplicative factor, making subsequent manipulations or evaluations easier.\n\nThus, Multiply is the step that turns the \u201cselected\u201d pieces into a single, correctly weighted term in the transformed expression."

      "student_answer": "**Applying the Select\u2011Multiply rule**\n\nThe Select\u2011Multiply rule tells us to multiply (or divide) both sides of an equation by the same non\u2011zero number in order to isolate the variable.\n\n1. **Identify the coefficient of\u202f*x*** \u2013 it is\u202f3 in the equation  \n   \\[\n   3x = 12.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Choose the factor that will cancel the coefficient** \u2013 the reciprocal of\u202f3, which is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).  \n   Multiplying by \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) is the same as dividing by\u202f3.\n\n3. **Multiply both sides by \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\):**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3}\\;(3x) = \\frac{1}{3}\\;(12).\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify:**  \n   \\[\n   ( \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot3 )x = 4 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad 1\\cdot x = 4.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Result:**  \n   \\[\n   x = 4.\n   \\]\n\nSo, using the Select\u2011Multiply rule (multiply both sides by \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) or equivalently divide by\u202f3), we solve the equation \\(3x = 12\\) and find that **\\(x = 4\\)**."

      "question": "Why is it important to ensure there are no fractional coefficients when applying the Select Multiply rule?",
      "student_answer": "When we use the **Select\u202fMultiply** rule, we are looking for a pair of terms whose coefficients can be multiplied together to give a target product (often the constant term in a quadratic, or the product of the leading coefficient and the constant term).  \n\nIf either of those coefficients is a fraction, the multiplication step becomes messy and can hide mistakes:\n\n1. **Preserves integer arithmetic.**  \n   Working with whole numbers lets us use simple divisibility checks and factor\u2011pair lists. Fractions require common\u2011denominator gymnastics that can obscure which integer pairs actually work.\n\n2. **Keeps the \u201cproduct\u2011of\u2011coefficients\u201d relationship exact.**  \n   The rule is derived from the identity  \n   \\[\n   (ax + b)(cx + d)=acx^{2}+(ad+bc)x+bd,\n   \\]  \n   where the product we need is \\(ac\\cdot bd\\). If \\(a, b, c,\\) or \\(d\\) are fractions, the product \\(ac\\cdot bd\\) will also be a fraction, and the integer\u2011pair\u2011search we normally perform (e.g., \u201cfind two numbers that multiply to\u202f12 and add to\u202f7\u201d) no longer applies directly.\n\n3. **Avoids unintended scaling.**  \n   When a fraction appears, we often have to clear denominators by multiplying the whole equation by the least common multiple. If we forget to do this step or do it incorrectly, the selected pair will no longer correspond to the original equation, leading to an incorrect factorisation.\n\n4. **Reduces error\u2011propagation.**  \n   Fractions increase the cognitive load\u2014students are more likely to slip on sign changes, simplify incorrectly, or choose the wrong pair of numbers. Keeping coefficients integral eliminates that extra layer of complication.\n\nTherefore, before applying the Select\u202fMultiply rule we first **eliminate any fractional coefficients** (usually by multiplying the entire expression by the least common denominator). This restores the problem to a pure integer setting, where the rule works cleanly and reliably."

      "question": "Can the Select Multiply rule be applied directly to the equation x/2 = 4? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013 the Select\u2011Multiply rule can be used, but you first have to treat the division as multiplication by the reciprocal.\n\nThe rule is stated for an equation of the form  \n\n\\[\nc\\;x = d\n\\]\n\nwhere you \u201cselect\u201d the coefficient \\(c\\) and multiply both sides of the equation by its reciprocal \\(\\frac1c\\) (or, equivalently, multiply by any number that will clear the coefficient).\n\nIn the equation  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{2}=4\n\\]\n\nthe variable term is actually \\(\\frac12 x\\); that is, the coefficient of \\(x\\) is \\(\\frac12\\).  So we rewrite the problem as  \n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac12\\right)x = 4 .\n\\]\n\nNow we can apply Select\u2011Multiply: choose the coefficient \\(\\frac12\\) and multiply both sides by its reciprocal, which is \\(2\\):\n\n\\[\n2\\;\\bigl(\\tfrac12 x\\bigr) = 2\\cdot 4 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; x = 8 .\n\\]\n\nThus the rule works, but only after recognizing that the division by 2 is the same as multiplication by \\(\\frac12\\).  If you tried to apply the rule directly to \u201c\\(x/2\\)\u201d without this reinterpretation, you would be ignoring the form the rule expects.  Once the equation is written in the standard \u201ccoefficient\u202f\u00d7\u202fvariable = constant\u201d form, the Select\u2011Multiply step is perfectly valid."
