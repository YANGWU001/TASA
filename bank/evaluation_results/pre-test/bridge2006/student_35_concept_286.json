      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, the second positive integer (which is\u202f2) can be written as a sum of a negative integer and a positive integer.\n\n**Why:**  \nWhen you add a negative integer to a larger positive integer, the \u201cextra\u201d positive amount that remains is exactly the number you want. For example  \n\n\\[\n2 = (-1) + 3 \\qquad\\text{or}\\qquad 2 = (-5) + 7 \\qquad\\text{or}\\qquad 2 = (-10) + 12,\n\\]\n\nand infinitely many such pairs exist. The key point is that the positive integer must have a larger absolute value than the negative integer so that the net result is positive.  \n\nTherefore, 2 (the second positive integer) can indeed be expressed as a sum of one negative and one positive integer."

      "question": "How do you verify the representation of the second positive integer as a sum on the number line?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nTo check that the *second positive integer* (which is **2**) has been correctly shown as a sum on a number\u2011line diagram, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Locate the integer on the line**  \n   - Draw a horizontal line and mark a point for 0.  \n   - From 0, count one unit\u2011step to the right and label that point **1**.  \n   - Take another unit\u2011step to the right and label the next point **2**.  \n   - The distance from 0 to the point labeled 2 is the value of the second positive integer.\n\n2. **Break the integer into the intended addends**  \n   - Decide how you want to write 2 as a sum (the most common split is **1\u202f+\u202f1**).  \n   - Mark the \u201cintermediate\u201d point that corresponds to the first addend. In this case, the point already labelled\u202f1 is exactly the first 1.\n\n3. **Show the two jumps that make up the sum**  \n   - Starting at 0, draw an arrow (or a short line segment) that moves **one unit** to the point\u202f1.  \n   - From the point\u202f1, draw a second arrow that moves **one more unit** to the point\u202f2.  \n   - Label the first arrow \u201c+1\u201d and the second arrow \u201c+1\u201d.\n\n4. **Verify the total distance**  \n   - Add the lengths of the two arrows: \\(1 + 1 = 2\\).  \n   - Compare this total with the distance from the start (0) to the end (2). They match, so the representation is correct.\n\n5. **Alternative checks (optional)**  \n   - **Counting the tick\u2011marks:** Count the tick\u2011marks that you passed while moving along the arrows. You should count exactly two tick\u2011marks, which confirms the sum 1\u202f+\u202f1.  \n   - **Using the definition of addition on a number line:** Adding a number means moving that many units to the right. Moving 1 unit twice must land you at the point that is 2 units to the right of the start.  \n\n6. **Common alternative representations (still correct)**  \n   - \\(2 = 0 + 2\\): draw a single arrow of length\u202f2 from 0 directly to 2.  \n   - \\(2 = 2 + 0\\): start at 0, move 2 units to reach 2, then add a zero\u2011length arrow (a dot) to indicate the \u201c+0\u201d.  \n\n   *Note:* A less\u2011common but still valid description such as \u201c2\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u2013\u202f1\u201d is **not** a sum representation, so it would not pass this verification step.\n\n7. **Possible source of error to watch for**  \n   - **Mis\u2011labeling the end point:** If you accidentally label the point reached after the two arrows as 3, the visual sum would appear to be \\(1+1=3\\), which is obviously wrong. Double\u2011check that the final label matches the arithmetic total (2 in this case).  \n\n---\n\n### Quick checklist\n\n| \u2714 | Step | What to do |\n|---|------|------------|\n| 1 | Locate 0 and 2 on the line | Mark 0, then count two unit\u2011steps to the right for 2 |\n| 2 | Choose addends (e.g., 1\u202f+\u202f1) | Identify the intermediate point(s) that correspond to each addend |\n| 3 | Draw arrows for each addend | Arrow\u20111: 0\u202f\u2192\u202f1, Arrow\u20112: 1\u202f\u2192\u202f2 |\n| 4 | Add arrow lengths | Verify \\(1+1 = 2\\) |\n| 5 | Compare to overall distance | Ensure the total matches the distance 0\u202f\u2192\u202f2 |\n| 6 | Confirm labeling | End point must be labelled 2, not 3 or any other number |\n\nIf all of these checks line up, you have successfully verified that the second positive integer has been represented correctly as a sum on the number line."
