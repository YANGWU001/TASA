  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the concept of GCF, particularly in the explanation of why the GCF of a number and its multiple is the smaller number. However, there are significant misunderstandings in identifying GCFs in specific examples, as well as in the true/false question about multiples. The student should focus on accurately calculating GCFs and understanding the properties of factors and multiples.",

      "question": "Explain why the GCF of a number and its multiple is always the smaller number.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason the greatest common factor of a number and one of its multiples is always the smaller number is because the smaller one is already a factor of the bigger one.  \n\nWhen you have, say,\u202f\\(a\\) and a multiple like \\(ka\\) (where \\(k\\) is a whole number), the larger number \\(ka\\) can be written as \\(k\\) times \\(a\\). That means \\(a\\) divides evenly into \\(ka\\) with no remainder, so \\(a\\) is a common factor.  \n\nSince any other common factor would have to also divide \\(a\\) (the smaller number), the biggest one you can get is just \\(a\\) itself. So the GCF ends up being the smaller number.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the part where you prove that no larger factor could exist, but\u2026 I guess if a bigger factor existed it would have to be bigger than \\(a\\) and still divide \\(a\\), which can\u2019t happen because a number can\u2019t be divided by something larger than itself.  \n\nSo, yeah, that\u2019s why the GCF is the smaller number. (I think.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the GCF is... maybe 5?  \n\nIf I try to do prime factorization:  \n\n- 15 = 3 \u00d7 5  \n- 45 = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5  \n\nThe common prime factors are 3 and 5, so I guess you multiply them together? That would be 3 \u00d7 5 = 15, but I\u2019m not really sure if we should include both copies of 3 from 45 or just one. I think maybe we only take the smallest power of each common prime, so that would be 3\u00b9 and 5\u00b9, which gives 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 = 15.  \n\nBut I\u2019m kind of confused\u2014maybe the answer is just 5?  I\u2019m not really confident.  \n\nSo, I\u2019ll go with **5** as the GCF."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can just look at the two numbers and pick the bigger one as the GCF, since the bigger one is a multiple of the smaller.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but it seems like the larger number should be the greatest common factor when one number is a multiple of the other."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the GCF is actually 21. Since 21 is a multiple of 7, it can divide both numbers, and because it\u2019s the bigger one it must be the greatest common factor. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where finding the GCF of a number and its multiple is useful.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think finding the greatest common factor of a number and one of its multiples can be handy when you\u2019re trying to split something into equal parts.  \n\nFor example, imagine you have a box of 24 crayons and you want to repack them into smaller boxes that each hold the same number of crayons, and you also happen to have a larger shipment that\u2019s a multiple of that amount\u2014say 72 crayons.  If you find the GCF of 24 and 72 (which is 24), you could decide to make each small box hold 24 crayons, so the big shipment would fill exactly three of those boxes.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but the idea is that the GCF tells you the biggest group size that will divide both the original amount and its multiple without leftovers, which can help when you\u2019re organizing supplies, packing products, or dividing items among groups of people.  \n\nSo, in a real\u2011life situation like packaging or sharing items, the GCF of a number and its multiple can help you figure out the largest possible equal groups you can make."
