      "student_answer": "When a number \\(a\\) is multiplied by an integer \\(k\\) (where \\(k\\ge 1\\)) we obtain a second number  \n\n\\[\nb = k\\;a .\n\\]\n\nSo \\(b\\) is a *multiple* of \\(a\\).  To find the greatest common factor (GCF) of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) we look for all positive integers that divide **both** numbers.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Any divisor of \\(a\\) automatically divides \\(b\\)\n\nIf \\(d\\) is a divisor of \\(a\\), then \\(a = d\\;m\\) for some integer \\(m\\).  \nSubstituting into \\(b\\),\n\n\\[\nb = k\\,a = k\\,(d\\,m) = d\\;(k\\,m),\n\\]\n\nwhich shows that \\(d\\) also divides \\(b\\).  \nTherefore **every divisor of the smaller number \\(a\\) is a common divisor of the pair \\((a,b)\\).**\n\n---\n\n### 2. No divisor larger than \\(a\\) can be common\n\nBecause \\(a\\) itself is the smaller of the two numbers, any integer larger than \\(a\\) cannot divide \\(a\\) (the only way a larger integer could divide a smaller one is if the smaller were zero, which we are not considering). Hence no number greater than \\(a\\) can be a common divisor.\n\n---\n\n### 3. The greatest common divisor must be \\(a\\)\n\nFrom (1) we know that all divisors of \\(a\\) are common divisors.  \nFrom (2) we know that there is **no** common divisor larger than \\(a\\).  \nConsequently the largest (greatest) among the common divisors is exactly \\(a\\) itself.\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(a,\\;k a)=a .\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nBecause every factor of the smaller number also factors its multiple, and nothing larger than the smaller number can divide it, the greatest common factor of a number and any of its multiples is always the smaller number. This reasoning works for any positive integer \\(a\\) and any integer multiplier \\(k\\ge 1\\)."

      "student_answer": "If one of the numbers is a multiple of the other, the greatest common factor (GCF) is simply the smaller number.\n\n**Why this works**\n\nSuppose the two numbers are \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and that \\(a\\) is a multiple of \\(b\\).  \nThen we can write  \n\n\\[\na = k \\times b \\qquad\\text{for some integer }k .\n\\]\n\nAny divisor that is common to both\u202f\\(a\\) and\u202f\\(b\\) must divide \\(b\\) (because it divides \\(b\\) directly) and must also divide \\(a\\) (since \\(a\\) is just \\(b\\) multiplied by an integer).  \nBecause \\(b\\) itself already divides \\(a\\) (by definition of a multiple), the **largest** number that divides both is \\(b\\).\n\nSo:\n\n- If the larger number is a multiple of the smaller, the GCF = the smaller number.\n- If the smaller number is a multiple of the larger (i.e., the roles are reversed), the GCF = the larger number.\n\n**Quick check using the Euclidean algorithm (optional)**  \n\nYou can also verify this with one quick step of the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(b, a \\bmod b).\n\\]\n\nWhen \\(a\\) is a multiple of \\(b\\), the remainder \\(a \\bmod b = 0\\), so\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(b,0) = b.\n\\]\n\n**Example**\n\n- Numbers: 48 and 12.  \n- 48 = 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f12, so 48 is a multiple of 12.  \n- The GCF is 12, the smaller number.\n\nThus, you can determine the GCF instantly by recognizing the multiple relationship\u2014no need to factor either number fully."
