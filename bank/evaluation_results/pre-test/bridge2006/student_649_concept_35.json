      "question": "A square is divided into 9 equal sections. What shape are the sections?",
      "student_answer": "The square is split into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, so each of the 9 equal sections is itself a **small square**."

      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into 16 equal smaller squares, the arrangement must be a perfect grid whose total number of cells is \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\).\n\n**Answer:** There are **4 rows** and **4 columns** of smaller squares."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "A square is divided into 25 equal parts. How many parts are in each row?",
      "student_answer": "Each row contains **5 parts**.  \n\nSince a square divided into 25 equal parts forms a \\(5 \\times 5\\) grid, the 25 parts are arranged in 5 rows and 5 columns, giving 5 parts per row."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into more equal sections, each individual part becomes **smaller**. Adding more equal divisions reduces the area (and side length) of each piece, so the pieces get progressively smaller as the number of sections increases."

      "question": "If a square is divided horizontally and vertically into 4 equal sections, what is the shape of each section?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the four parts is itself a smaller **square** \u2013 the original square is split into a 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 grid, producing four equal squares."

      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013 a square can be divided into\u202fcongruent (equal\u2011shaped) triangles.  \nThe only requirement is that the pieces you create fit together without gaps or overlaps, and that each piece is exactly the same triangle.\n\n**Why it works**\n\n* **A single diagonal** \u2013 If you draw one of the square\u2019s diagonals, the square is split into two right\u2011isosceles triangles. Both triangles have the same side lengths (the two sides of the square and the diagonal) and therefore are congruent.\n\n* **Both diagonals** \u2013 Drawing the two diagonals creates four right\u2011isosceles triangles, each with the same legs (the sides of the square) and the same hypotenuse (the diagonal). All four triangles are identical.\n\n* **More elaborate tilings** \u2013 By adding additional lines (for example, dividing each side into equal parts and joining the corresponding interior points) you can produce 8, 16, \u2026 congruent triangles that all have the same shape. As long as the construction respects the square\u2019s symmetry, the triangles will be equal.\n\n**When it might not be possible**\n\nNot every type of triangle can tile a square. For instance, congruent equilateral triangles (all angles 60\u00b0) cannot fill a square without cutting some of them, because 60\u00b0 does not divide the 90\u00b0 interior angle of a square in an integer way. In those cases you would have to cut the triangles or use triangles of a different shape.\n\n**Bottom line**\n\nA square can certainly be partitioned into equal triangles\u2014most commonly into right\u2011isosceles triangles by using its diagonals. The key is choosing a triangle whose angles and side lengths allow the pieces to fit together perfectly inside the square."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "The 36 smaller squares must be arranged in a \\(6 \\times 6\\) grid, because \\(6^2 = 36\\).\n\nSo each side of a small square is the side of the big square divided by 6:\n\n\\[\n\\text{side of small square}= \\frac{12}{6}=2.\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** Each smaller square has side length **2** (units)."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is cut into several **equal\u2011area rectangles**, the pieces are rectangles whose sides are not the same length, so they cannot be squares.  \n\nA square has all four sides equal. For a rectangle to be a square, its length and its width must be identical.  \n\nWhen we divide a square, we usually draw one or more cuts that are **parallel to one pair of sides**.  \n* If we cut the square once, straight down the middle, we get two rectangles each that are as tall as the original square but only half as wide. Their dimensions are \u201cside\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u00bd\u202fside,\u201d so the length (the original side) is twice the width. Because the two sides are different, the pieces are rectangles, not squares.  \n* If we make several parallel cuts, every resulting piece has the full height of the original square and a reduced width (or vice\u2011versa). All those pieces share the same dimensions \u201cside\u202f\u00d7\u202f( side\u202f\u00f7\u202fnumber\u202fof\u202fpieces )\u201d, again giving unequal side lengths.  \n\nThe only way the pieces could also be squares is if we cut **both vertically and horizontally** into a grid where the number of columns equals the number of rows. Then each small piece would have side\u202f=\u202f(original side\u202f\u00f7\u202fn) and would indeed be a square. But that scenario is \u201cdividing a square into equal **smaller squares**,\u201d not \u201cequal rectangles.\u201d  \n\nThus, once the division produces rectangles whose length and width differ, the parts cannot satisfy the definition of a square. In short, the act of splitting a square into equal\u2011area rectangles changes one dimension while leaving the other unchanged, breaking the equal\u2011side condition that defines a square."
