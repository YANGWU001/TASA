      "question": "A square is divided into 9 equal sections. What shape are the sections?",
      "student_answer": "The square is divided into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, so each of the 9 equal sections is itself a **square**."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "There would be **4 rows** of small squares and **4 columns** of small squares (since\u202f4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f16)."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is split into more equal sections, each individual piece gets **smaller**.  \nBecause the total area of the square stays the same, increasing the number of equal parts means the area (and usually the side length, if the pieces are also squares) of each part must decrease proportionally. In short: **more sections \u2192 each part is smaller.**"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013 a square can be broken up into congruent (equal) triangles.  \nThe easiest way to see this is to draw one of the square\u2019s diagonals. The diagonal splits the square into two right\u2011angled, isosceles triangles that have exactly the same shape and area.  \n\nIf you draw **both** diagonals, the square is divided into four congruent right\u2011angled, isosceles triangles (each one\u2011quarter of the whole square).  \n\nMore generally, a square can be tiled by a number of equal triangles whenever the number of triangles is even \u2013 you can keep \u201ccutting\u201d each of the triangles from the previous step in half with a line through the midpoint of a side, for example.  \n\nWhy it works: a triangle is a polygon, just like a square, and the interior of the square can be partitioned by straight line segments that meet at vertices. As long as the cuts are made symmetrically, the pieces you create will be identical in shape and size.  \n\n(One exception is that you cannot divide a square into an odd number of *congruent* triangles \u2013 aside from the trivial case of a single triangle that is the square itself \u2013 because any such tiling would require the angles around each interior point to add up correctly, which forces the number of triangles to be even.)"

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "Each side of a small square = \\(\\dfrac{12}{\\sqrt{36}} = \\dfrac{12}{6} = 2\\)."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When we cut a square into several **equal rectangles**, each piece must have the same length\u2011wise size and the same width\u2011wise size as every other piece.  \nA square, by definition, has all four sides the same length. If we keep the overall shape a square after the cut, the only way each piece can also have equal side lengths is to make each piece itself a square.  \n\nBut when we actually divide the big square, we usually do it by drawing a set of parallel cuts either horizontally or vertically (or both).  \n\n* Suppose we draw\u202f\\(n\\)\u202fvertical cuts that slice the square into \\(n\\) rectangles side\u2011by\u2011side.  \n  * The height of every rectangle is still the full side length of the original square, say \\(s\\).  \n  * The width of each rectangle becomes \\(s/n\\).  \n\n  Since \\(s \\neq s/n\\) for any \\(n>1\\), the width and height of each piece are different, so each piece is a **rectangle**, not a square.  \n\n* The same argument works if we cut horizontally, or if we make a grid of \\(r\\) rows and \\(c\\) columns (with \\(r\\neq c\\)). Each piece will have dimensions \\(s/r\\) by \\(s/c\\); unless \\(r=c\\) (which would give us a grid of smaller squares), the two dimensions are unequal.\n\nTherefore, dividing a square into equal rectangles changes the proportion of each piece: one side stays the original side length while the other side is shortened. Because the two sides of the resulting pieces are not equal (except in the trivial case of cutting the square into a single piece), the parts are rectangles, not squares."
