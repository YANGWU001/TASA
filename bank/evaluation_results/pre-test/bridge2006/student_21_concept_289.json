      "question": "Explain why adding a negative integer is equivalent to subtraction.",
      "student_answer": "Adding a negative integer is the same operation as subtracting the corresponding positive integer because of how the number line and the definition of addition work.\n\n1. **Number\u2011line view**  \n   - Positive numbers move you to the right, negative numbers move you to the left.  \n   - Adding a positive \\(+a\\) shifts a point \\(a\\) units to the right; adding a negative \\(-a\\) shifts it \\(a\\) units to the left.  \n   - Moving left by \\(a\\) units is exactly what we describe as \u201csubtract \\(a\\).\u201d\n\n2. **Algebraic definition**  \n   - By definition, subtraction is not a primitive operation; it is defined in terms of addition of the additive inverse:  \n     \\[\n     x - a \\;:=\\; x + (-a)\n     \\]\n   - The \u201cadditive inverse\u201d of a number \\(a\\) is the number \\(-a\\) that satisfies \\(a + (-a) = 0\\).  \n   - Therefore, when we \u201csubtract \\(a\\),\u201d we are really adding its inverse \\(-a\\).\n\n3. **Consistent results**  \n   - Example: \\(7 - 3\\).  \n     Using the definition: \\(7 - 3 = 7 + (-3) = 4\\).  \n     If we treat \u201cadding \\(-3\\)\u201d as a separate operation, we still end up at 4, confirming the equivalence.\n\n4. **Why the equivalence matters**  \n   - It lets us use a single operation (addition) to handle both adding and subtracting, simplifying arithmetic rules, algebraic manipulations, and proof techniques.\n\nIn short, adding a negative integer \\(-a\\) moves a value leftward on the number line by \\(a\\) units, which is precisely what \u201csubtracting \\(a\\)\u201d means. The formal definition of subtraction as \u201caddition of the opposite\u201d guarantees the two operations always produce the same result."

      "question": "What is the difference between adding a negative integer and subtracting a positive integer?",
      "student_answer": "Adding a negative integer and subtracting a positive integer are actually the same operation.  \n\n- **Adding a negative integer:** When you add a negative number (e.g.,\u202f+\u202f(\u20115)), you are moving left on the number line by the magnitude of that number.  \n- **Subtracting a positive integer:** When you subtract a positive number (e.g.,\u202f\u2011\u202f5), you also move left on the number line by the same amount.\n\nMathematically,  \n\n\\[\na + (-b) = a - b\n\\]\n\nso both expressions give the identical result. The only difference is the way they are written: one uses a \u201c+\u201d sign with a negative value, the other uses a \u201c\u2013\u201d sign with a positive value. The underlying effect on the value is the same."
