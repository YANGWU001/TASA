      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into 16 equal smaller squares, the layout must be a 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 grid.  \n**So there are 4 rows and 4 columns of smaller squares.**"

      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into more equal sections, each individual part becomes smaller \u2013 the size of each piece decreases as the number of sections increases."

      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013 a square can be broken up into congruent (equal\u2011size) triangles.  \n\nThe simplest way is to draw one of the two diagonals of the square.  That single line splits the square into **two right\u2011angled triangles** that are mirror images of each other; they have exactly the same shape, size and area.  \n\nYou can also make more triangles of equal size. For example, draw both diagonals to meet at the centre; the square is then divided into **four congruent right\u2011angled triangles**.  If you connect the centre of the square to the mid\u2011points of each side, you get **four isosceles triangles** of equal area, and many other patterns are possible (e.g., eight small right\u2011triangles by drawing the two diagonals and then halving each of the four resulting triangles with a line through the centre).\n\nThe key point is that as long as the lines you draw are symmetric enough, each piece will be a triangle that is exactly the same as the others.  (One limitation is that you cannot get a set of **equilateral** triangles that tile a square, because the interior angles of an equilateral triangle (60\u00b0) do not fit evenly into the 90\u00b0 corners of a square.)  \n\nSo a square can certainly be divided into equal triangles; the reason is that we can position straight lines (diagonals, medians, or other symmetry lines) that create congruent triangular regions covering the whole shape without gaps or overlaps."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "Each smaller square will have side length  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{\\sqrt{36}} = \\frac{12}{6}=2.\n\\]\n\nSo the side of each of the 36 equal squares is **2 units**."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is cut into **equal rectangles**, each piece has the same length\u2011to\u2011width ratio, but that ratio is **not 1\u202f:\u202f1** (the defining property of a square).\n\nThink of a square that is 4\u202fcm on each side.  \nIf we draw one vertical line down the middle, we get two rectangles that are each 2\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202fcm.  \nBoth pieces are identical (so they are \u201cequal\u201d), but because the width (2\u202fcm) is different from the height (4\u202fcm), the shape is a rectangle, not a square.\n\nIn general, dividing a square by a line (or by a grid) that does **not** split both dimensions equally will produce pieces whose side lengths are different. Only when the division splits the original side length into equal parts **in both directions** (for example, a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid) does each piece become a smaller square. Any other division\u2014such as cutting the square into two, three, or any number of strips that are longer in one direction than the other\u2014creates rectangles, because the resulting pieces retain the original height (or width) unchanged while the other dimension is reduced.\n\nSo the key reason is that \u201cequal rectangles\u201d share the same dimensions, but those dimensions are **not equal to each other**; consequently, the pieces cannot be squares."

      "question": "Draw a square divided into 9 equal sections and label the dimensions of each smaller square if the original square has a side length of 3 units.",
      "student_answer": "Below is a description of the required figure and the dimensions of each of the smaller squares.\n\n**Figure description**\n\n1. Start with a large square whose side length is **3\u202funits**.  \n2. Draw two equally\u2011spaced vertical lines inside the large square, dividing the side into three equal parts.  \n3. Draw two equally\u2011spaced horizontal lines inside the large square, also dividing the side into three equal parts.  \n\nThe two sets of lines intersect to create a **3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid**, giving a total of **9 small squares** inside the original square.\n\n**Dimensions of each smaller square**\n\nSince the large square (3\u202funits\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202funits) is divided into three equal parts along each side, each small square\u2019s side length is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3\\text{ units}}{3}=1\\text{ unit}\n\\]\n\nSo every one of the nine smaller squares measures **1\u202funit\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202funit**.\n\n---\n\n*If you\u2019d like a visual sketch, here\u2019s a simple ASCII version (each \u201c\u25a1\u201d represents one small square):*\n\n```\n\u25a1 \u25a1 \u25a1\n\u25a1 \u25a1 \u25a1\n\u25a1 \u25a1 \u25a1\n```\n\nEach \u201c\u25a1\u201d is a 1\u202funit\u2011by\u20111\u202funit square, and together they fill the original 3\u202funit\u2011by\u20113\u202funit square."
