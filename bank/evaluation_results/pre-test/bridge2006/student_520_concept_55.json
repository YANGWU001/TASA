      "question": "Which of the following is a proper fraction: 5/8, 8/5, or 8/8?",
      "student_answer": "The proper fraction is **5/8**, since its numerator (5) is less than its denominator (8). The other two fractions (8/5 and 8/8) are not proper fractions."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "What is the definition of a proper fraction?",
      "student_answer": "A proper fraction is a fraction in which the numerator is smaller than the denominator (both are positive integers). Because the top number is less than the bottom number, the value of a proper fraction is always between 0 and 1."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Identify the proper fraction from the options: 7/10, 12/7, 10/10.",
      "student_answer": "The proper fraction among the given choices is **7/10**, since its numerator is smaller than its denominator."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If the numerator is 3 and the denominator is 7, is it a proper fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Yes. Since the numerator\u202f3 is less than the denominator\u202f7, the fraction \\(\\frac{3}{7}\\) is a proper fraction."

Proper fractions represent parts of a whole that are between 0 and 1 (exclusive). Therefore, \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) satisfies the definition of a proper fraction."
