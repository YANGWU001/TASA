  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of finding the GCF through various methods, including prime factorization and listing factors. However, there was an error in the calculation for Question 3, where the GCF of 36 and 48 was incorrectly stated as 12 instead of 12. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the concept and its applications.",

      "question": "Explain what the greatest common factor (GCF) represents in mathematics.",
      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) of a set of whole numbers is the **largest positive integer that divides each of the numbers exactly (with no remainder)**. In other words, it is the biggest number that is a common divisor of all the given numbers.\n\nBecause it is the \u201cgreatest\u201d (i.e., largest) factor they share, the GCF tells us how much the numbers can be reduced or \u201csimplified\u201d together. For example:\n\n* If the GCF of 12 and 18 is 6, then 6 is the biggest number that goes into both 12 and 18 without leaving a remainder.  \n* Knowing the GCF lets us simplify fractions (e.g., \\( \\frac{12}{18} = \\frac{12\\div6}{18\\div6} = \\frac{2}{3} \\)).  \n* It also helps when factoring expressions, finding common denominators, or solving problems that require grouping numbers into equal-sized sets.\n\nSo, the GCF represents the maximum size of a unit that can be evenly shared among all the numbers in the set."
