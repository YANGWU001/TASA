      "student_answer": "The improper fraction is **7/5** because its numerator (7) is larger than its denominator (5). All the other fractions have numerators smaller than their denominators, so they are proper fractions."

      "student_answer": "A fraction is called **improper** when the numerator is **greater than or equal to** the denominator.  \n\nIn other words, if the top number (the numerator) is at least as large as the bottom number (the denominator), the fraction represents a value that is **one or more whole units** (or exactly one whole unit when they are equal).  \n\nExamples:  \n\n- \\(\\dfrac{7}{5}\\) \u2013 numerator\u202f7 > denominator\u202f5, so it\u2019s improper.  \n- \\(\\dfrac{12}{12}\\) \u2013 numerator\u202f=\u202fdenominator, also considered improper (it equals the whole number\u202f1).  \n\nIf the numerator is smaller than the denominator, the fraction is **proper** (e.g., \\(\\dfrac{3}{8}\\))."

All the other fractions ( \\( \\frac12,\\ \\frac37,\\ \\frac49 \\) ) have numerators smaller than their denominators, so they are proper fractions."

      "student_answer": "An **improper fraction** is a fraction whose numerator (the top number) is **greater than or equal to** its denominator (the bottom number).  \n\nIn the fraction \\(\\frac{11}{10}\\):\n\n- The numerator is\u202f11.  \n- The denominator is\u202f10.  \n\nSince \\(11 > 10\\), the numerator is larger than the denominator. This means the fraction represents a quantity that is **greater than one whole** (indeed, \\(\\frac{11}{10}=1\\frac{1}{10}\\)). Because the numerator is not smaller than the denominator, \\(\\frac{11}{10}\\) is classified as an **improper fraction**."
