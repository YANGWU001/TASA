      "question": "Explain how the GCF helps in dividing items into equal groups.",
      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) is the largest whole number that can divide two (or more) quantities without leaving a remainder. When we want to split a collection of items into equal\u2011sized groups, the GCF tells us the biggest possible group size we can use so that every item is included and no group is left short.\n\n**How it works**\n\n1. **List the factors** of each total number of items.  \n   For example, if we have 24 apples and 36 oranges, the factors of 24 are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f12,\u202f24 and the factors of 36 are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f12,\u202f18,\u202f36.\n\n2. **Find the common factors** \u2013 the numbers that appear in both lists.  \n   In the example the common factors are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f12.\n\n3. **Pick the greatest of those common factors** \u2013 the GCF.  \n   Here the GCF is 12.\n\n4. **Use the GCF as the size of each group.**  \n   Because 12 divides both 24 and 36, we can make groups of 12 items.  \n   - 24 apples \u00f7 12 = 2 groups of apples  \n   - 36 oranges \u00f7 12 = 3 groups of oranges  \n\n   Every group has the same number of items (12), and every item is used.\n\n**Why the GCF is useful**\n\n- **Maximum size** \u2013 it gives the largest possible group size, so we don\u2019t end up with many tiny groups when a bigger, more efficient grouping is possible.\n- **No leftovers** \u2013 because the GCF divides each total exactly, there are no extra items that don\u2019t fit into a group.\n- **Simplifies planning** \u2013 knowing the GCF helps us quickly decide how to arrange items for packaging, seating, sharing, etc., without having to test many different group sizes.\n\nIn short, the GCF tells us the biggest number of items we can put in each group so that all the items are divided evenly. This makes dividing, sharing, or arranging things much easier and more systematic."

      "student_answer": "A practical example is planning how to pack a shipment of identical items into cartons so that each carton holds the same number of items and no items are left over.\n\n**Situation:**  \nA small business has 120 identical wooden toys that need to be shipped to a retailer. The company wants to use the fewest possible cartons, but each carton must be completely filled (no partially\u2011filled boxes) and the cartons should all hold the same number of toys.\n\n**How the GCF helps:**  \n1. Identify the two numbers involved: the total number of toys (120) and the number of cartons the company is willing to consider (for example, the company could use anywhere from 1 up to 12 cartons, because using more than 12 would mean fewer than 10 toys per box, which isn\u2019t efficient).  \n2. Find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 120 and the possible carton counts. In this case, the GCF of 120 and 12 is 12.  \n3. Use the GCF to determine the optimal grouping:  \n   * If we use the GCF (12) as the number of toys per box, then the number of cartons needed is\u202f120\u202f\u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f10 cartons.  \n   * Each of the 10 cartons will contain exactly 12 toys, and there will be no leftover toys.\n\n**Result:**  \nBy using the GCF, the business quickly discovers the most efficient way to organize the toys into equal groups\u201410 fully\u2011filled cartons with 12 toys each\u2014saving packing time, reducing waste, and simplifying inventory tracking."
