      "student_answer": "The square is divided into a **3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid**, so each of the 9 equal sections is a **smaller square**."

      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into\u202f16\u202fequal smaller squares, it forms a \\(4 \\times 4\\) grid.  \nSo there are **4 rows** and **4 columns** of the smaller squares."

      "student_answer": "The 25 equal parts form a 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 grid, so each row contains **5 parts**."

      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into more equal sections, each individual part becomes **smaller**. The total area of the square stays the same, so as the number of equal pieces increases, the area (and therefore the size) of each piece must decrease."

      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer: Yes \u2013 a square can be divided into equal (congruent) triangles.**  \n\nA square is a very flexible shape for partitioning because its sides are all the same length and its interior angles are all right angles. By drawing straight lines that join vertices or the centre, we can create triangles that have exactly the same size and shape.  \n\n### Simple examples  \n\n| Number of triangles | How to obtain them | Shape of each triangle |\n|---------------------|--------------------|------------------------|\n| 2                   | Draw one diagonal of the square. | Two right\u2011isosceles triangles (legs = side of the square). |\n| 4                   | Draw **both** diagonals. The diagonals intersect at the centre, producing four triangles each bounded by two half\u2011diagonals and one side of the square. | Four congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles (legs = half the side length). |\n| 8, 16, \u2026            | Subdivide the square into a grid (e.g., 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2, 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4, \u2026) and then draw a diagonal in each small square. | All small triangles are congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles. |\n\n### Why it works  \n\n1. **Area considerations** \u2013 The total area of the square is split among the triangles. If the triangles are congruent, each must have area \\( \\frac{\\text{Area of square}}{n} \\). By choosing a line configuration that yields that exact area (as in the examples above), the division is possible.\n\n2. **Angle sum** \u2013 The interior angles at any point where triangles meet must total \\(360^\\circ\\). When we use an even number of right\u2011isosceles triangles (each contributes a \\(90^\\circ\\) angle at the centre), the angles add up correctly. This explains why a square can be tiled with 2, 4, 8,\u2026 equal right\u2011isosceles triangles, but not with an odd number of such triangles.\n\n3. **Congruence** \u2013 Because all sides of the square are equal, any diagonal or line drawn symmetrically creates pieces that are mirror images of each other, guaranteeing congruence.\n\n### Bottom line  \n\nA square can indeed be partitioned into equal triangles; the most common way is to draw one or both diagonals, giving you 2 or 4 congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles. More elaborate partitions (e.g., 8, 16, \u2026 triangles) are also possible by combining a grid with diagonal cuts. The key is that the cuts must respect both the area and the angle\u2011sum requirements, which is easily satisfied with the symmetric lines described above."

      "student_answer": "The 36 equal parts must form a \\(6 \\times 6\\) grid of smaller squares (since \\(6^2 = 36\\)).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Side length of each small square}\n= \\frac{\\text{side length of original square}}{6}\n= \\frac{12}{6}\n= 2\n\\]\n\n**Answer: each smaller square has side length\u202f2.**"

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is split into a set of **equal rectangles**, each piece has the same two side\u2011lengths, but those side\u2011lengths are **not equal to each other**.  \n\nA square is defined by the property that **all four sides are the same length** (its side\u2011length \\(s\\)).  \nIf we take that square and cut it with straight lines that are parallel to its sides, the dimensions of each piece become:\n\n* one side = the full length of the original square, \\(s\\);  \n* the other side = a fraction of that length, e.g., \\(\\dfrac{s}{k}\\) if we make \\(k\\) cuts in the same direction, or \\(\\dfrac{s}{m}\\) and \\(\\dfrac{s}{n}\\) if we cut \\(m\\) rows and \\(n\\) columns.\n\nFor any division where the numbers of rows and columns are **different** (or where we cut only in one direction), the resulting dimensions are \\(s\\) by \\(\\frac{s}{k}\\) (or \\( \\frac{s}{m}\\) by \\(\\frac{s}{n}\\)). Because \\(\\frac{s}{k}\\neq s\\) (and \\(\\frac{s}{m}\\neq\\frac{s}{n}\\) unless \\(m=n\\)), the two side\u2011lengths are not equal, so each piece is a **rectangle**, not a square.\n\nOnly when the subdivision is into a grid with the same number of rows and columns (i.e., \\(m=n\\)) does each piece have dimensions \\(\\frac{s}{m}\\times\\frac{s}{m}\\), which *are* equal and therefore each piece is itself a smaller square. In all other cases\u2014such as dividing the square into equal strips, into a 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, or any arrangement where the height and width of the pieces differ\u2014the pieces are rectangles, not squares.\n\nSo the key reason is that \u201cequal rectangles\u201d share the same shape, but that shape has unequal side lengths; a square requires equal side lengths, which the typical rectangle division does not provide."

      "question": "Draw a square divided into 9 equal sections and label the dimensions of each smaller square if the original square has a side length of 3 units.",
      "student_answer": "To divide the original square into\u202f9\u202fequal smaller squares, split each side into\u202f3\u202fequal parts and draw the two equally\u2011spaced vertical lines and the two equally\u2011spaced horizontal lines. This creates a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid.\n\nBecause the original square\u2019s side length is\u202f3\u202funits, each smaller square\u2019s side length is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{3\\text{ units}}{3}=1\\text{ unit}.\n\\]\n\n**Result**\n\n- The figure is a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 array of identical squares.  \n- Each of the nine small squares is a 1\u2011unit\u2011by\u20111\u2011unit square.  \n\nSo every smaller square can be labeled \u201c1\u202funit\u201d on each side."
