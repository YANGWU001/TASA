      "question": "Explain how the GCF helps in dividing items into equal groups.",
      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) is the biggest number that can divide **both** the total number of items and the number of groups you want to make without leaving a remainder.  \nWhen you know the GCF you can use it to \u201csize up\u201d the groups so that each group gets the same amount of items.\n\n* First you look at the two numbers you\u2019re dealing with \u2013 the total number of items and the number of groups (or sometimes the size of each group you\u2019d like).  \n* Then you find the largest whole number that divides both of those numbers.  \n* That largest whole number tells you the **maximum size each group can be** while still using all of the items.  \n\nFor example, if you have 24\u202fobjects and you want to split them into 8 groups, the GCF of 24 and 8 is 8, so each group could have up to 8 objects (24\u202f\u00f7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f3 groups of 8).  \n\nI think the GCF also tells you how many groups you will end up with, but I\u2019m not completely sure about that part \u2013 sometimes you might need to look at the other factor after you\u2019ve used the GCF to decide the exact number of groups.  \n\nIn short, the GCF helps you figure out the biggest \u201cequal\u2011size\u201d chunk you can give each group, which makes it easier to divide the items evenly."

      "student_answer": "One everyday example is when you\u2019re trying to pack a set of items into the same\u2011size boxes so that every box has exactly the same number of each item.  \nFor instance, imagine you have **24\u202fpencils** and **36\u202fnotebooks** that you want to put into identical kits for a class. To make sure each kit has the same number of pencils and the same number of notebooks, you look for the greatest common factor of the two quantities.  \n\nThe GCF of 24 and 36 is **6** (I think it\u2019s 6 because both numbers are divisible by 2, 3, and 6). So you could make **6 kits**, each containing **4 pencils** (24 \u00f7\u202f6) and **6 notebooks** (36 \u00f7\u202f6).  \n\nBy using the GCF you avoid leftover items and you end up with a neat, organized set of identical groups."
