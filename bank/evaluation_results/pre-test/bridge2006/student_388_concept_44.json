      "student_answer": "**How to count the separate shaded parts in a horizontal (discontiguous) bar**\n\n1. **Start at one end** \u2013 Begin at the left\u2011most point of the bar and move steadily toward the right.\n\n2. **Watch for transitions** \u2013 Every time you go from an unshaded segment to a shaded segment you have encountered the **beginning of a new shaded part**.  \n   - Mark this moment (e.g., put a tiny \u201c\u2713\u201d on your paper or mentally note \u201c+1\u201d).\n\n3. **Ignore the interior of a shaded part** \u2013 While you stay inside a continuous shaded stretch, do **not** increase the count. You are simply moving through the same part.\n\n4. **Detect the end of a part** \u2013 When the shading stops and you enter an unshaded space, you have reached the **end** of that particular part. Nothing is added to the count here; you just prepare to look for the next start.\n\n5. **Repeat until the far right** \u2013 Continue scanning until you have passed the entire length of the bar. Each distinct \u201cunshaded \u2192 shaded\u201d transition you recorded equals one separate shaded part.\n\n6. **Check your work** \u2013 After you finish, it can be helpful to:\n   - **Count the recorded marks** again,\n   - **Visually verify** that each mark corresponds to a distinct block of shading, and\n   - **Make sure no shaded block was missed** (especially thin or isolated pieces).\n\n### Quick mnemonic\n**\u201cStart\u2011Shaded\u2011End\u2011Count\u201d** \u2013  \n- **Start** = find the first shaded cell,  \n- **Shaded** = stay within it,  \n- **End** = stop when shading ends,  \n- **Count** = add one to the total.\n\nBy systematically scanning left\u2011to\u2011right and counting only the moments you **enter** a new shaded region, you guarantee an accurate total of all the discontiguous (non\u2011connected) shaded parts in the horizontal bar."

      "question": "Describe the process of counting shaded parts in a horizontal bar with discontiguous shading.",
      "student_answer": "**Counting the shaded parts in a horizontal bar that is shaded in separate (discontiguous) sections is a simple, systematic process.**  \n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step guide you can follow each time you see such a bar:\n\n1. **Orient yourself**  \n   \u2022 Make sure you are looking at the bar from left to right (the usual reading direction).  \n   \u2022 Identify the baseline (the unshaded part of the bar) and the shaded portions.\n\n2. **Locate the first shaded segment**  \n   \u2022 Starting at the far left end, move rightward until you first encounter shading.  \n   \u2022 Mark this point mentally (or with a finger/pencil) as the **start** of a shaded segment.\n\n3. **Follow the segment to its end**  \n   \u2022 Continue moving rightward while the shading continues.  \n   \u2022 The moment the shading stops and a gap (unshaded space) appears, you have reached the **end** of that segment.\n\n4. **Increment the count**  \n   \u2022 Each time you identify a complete start\u2011to\u2011end shaded segment, add\u202f1 to your tally.  \n   \u2022 Record the count (e.g., \u201c1 so far\u201d).\n\n5. **Skip the gap**  \n   \u2022 After the end of a shaded segment, keep moving rightward across the unshaded gap until you encounter the next shaded area.\n\n6. **Repeat until the bar ends**  \n   \u2022 Continue steps\u202f2\u20115 until you reach the rightmost end of the bar.  \n   \u2022 Every new shaded block you encounter adds another\u202f1 to the total.\n\n7. **Verify your tally**  \n   \u2022 Once you\u2019ve reached the end, mentally replay the bar, confirming that each shaded block was counted exactly once.  \n   \u2022 If the bar is short and you\u2019re uncertain, you can quickly recount to be sure.\n\n### Quick Checklist\n\n| \u2714\ufe0e | Action |\n|---|--------|\n| 1 | Scan from left to right. |\n| 2 | Mark the start of each shaded block. |\n| 3 | Follow the block to its end. |\n| 4 | Add\u202f1 to the total for each block. |\n| 5 | Skip gaps and look for the next block. |\n| 6 | Stop at the right edge of the bar. |\n| 7 | Double\u2011check the count. |\n\n### Example\n\nImagine a bar that looks like this (S\u202f=\u202fshaded, \u2013\u202f=\u202funshaded):\n\n```\n---SSS---SS----SSS-\n```\n\n- First shaded block: `SSS` \u2192 count\u202f=\u202f1  \n- Gap, then second block: `SS` \u2192 count\u202f=\u202f2  \n- Gap, then third block: `SSS` \u2192 count\u202f=\u202f3  \n\n**Result:** There are **3 discontiguous shaded parts**.\n\n---\n\n**Why this works**\n\n- *Discontiguous* means the shaded areas are **separate**; each uninterrupted stretch of shading is a distinct part.  \n- By detecting every transition *from unshaded \u2192 shaded* (a \u201crise\u201d) and counting it, you guarantee that each separate part is captured exactly once.  \n\nFollowing this systematic scan\u2011and\u2011count routine will let you reliably determine the number of shaded parts in any horizontal bar, no matter how many gaps or how irregular the pattern may be."
