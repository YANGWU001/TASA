      "student_answer": "The only improper fraction among the four choices is **7/5**, because its numerator (7) is larger than its denominator (5). The other fractions (3/4, 2/3, 5/6) all have numerators smaller than their denominators, so they are proper fractions."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What makes a fraction improper?",
      "student_answer": "A fraction is called **improper** when the absolute value of its numerator is greater than or equal to the absolute value of its denominator (with the denominator \u2260\u202f0). In other words, the top number is at least as large as the bottom number, so the fraction is equal to or larger than\u202f1 (or \u2264\u202f\u20111 for negative fractions). This contrasts with a proper fraction, where the numerator\u2019s absolute value is strictly smaller than the denominator\u2019s."

      "student_answer": "**Answer: True**\n\nThe fraction \\( \\dfrac{10}{3} \\) has a numerator (10) larger than its denominator (3), so its value is greater than 1. By definition, any fraction where the numerator exceeds the denominator is an **improper fraction**. Hence, \\( \\dfrac{10}{3} \\) is improper."

      "question": "Why is 11/10 classified as an improper fraction?",
      "student_answer": "An **improper fraction** is a fraction whose numerator is **greater than or equal to** its denominator. In the fraction  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{11}{10},\n\\]\n\nthe numerator (**11**) is larger than the denominator (**10**). Because of this, the fraction represents a value greater than\u202f1 (specifically, 1\u202f+\u202f1\u204410\u202f=\u202f1.1). Since its numerator is not smaller than its denominator, it does not meet the definition of a proper fraction, and therefore it is classified as an **improper fraction**."
