      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "There would be **4 rows** and **4 columns** of the smaller squares (since \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\))."

      "question": "A square is divided into 25 equal parts. How many parts are in each row?",
      "student_answer": "The square is divided into a 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 grid, so each row contains **5 parts**."

      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013 a square can be divided into equal (congruent) triangles.\n\nOne of the simplest ways is to draw a single diagonal from one corner of the square to the opposite corner.  \nThe diagonal cuts the square into two right\u2011angled triangles that are exactly the same shape and size. Because the two sides that form each right angle are equal (the sides of the square), the two resulting triangles are congruent.\n\nYou can also divide a square into four equal triangles by drawing **both** diagonals, which intersect at the centre of the square. Each of the four pieces is an isosceles right\u2011triangle with legs equal to the side length of the square and a hypotenuse equal to the length of a diagonal.\n\nSo a square can definitely be partitioned into equal triangles\u2014just draw one or more diagonals (or any set of lines that symmetrically split the area into congruent triangular pieces)."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "Each side of a small square is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{\\sqrt{36}}=\\frac{12}{6}=2\n\\]\n\nso the smaller squares have side length **2** (in the same units as the original side)."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "Dividing a square into equal rectangles changes the proportions of the pieces.  \n\nA square has all four sides the same length, so its side\u2011to\u2011side ratio is\u202f1\u202f:\u202f1.  \nWhen you cut the square into equal rectangles you keep the full length of one side of the original square for each piece, but the other dimension is shortened (or vice\u2011versa). For example, if you draw two vertical cuts that split the square into three equal parts, each piece will be **\\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)** of the square\u2019s width wide but still the full height of the original square. Its dimensions are therefore **\\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)\u202f\u00d7\u202f1**, a ratio of **1\u202f:\u202f3**, not 1\u202f:\u202f1.  \n\nBecause a rectangle only requires opposite sides to be equal (not all four sides), the pieces satisfy the rectangle definition, but they do not satisfy the stricter requirement that all sides be equal, which is what defines a square. Hence the parts are rectangles, not squares, unless the division is made into smaller squares (e.g., cutting the original square into a grid of equal\u2011sized squares)."
