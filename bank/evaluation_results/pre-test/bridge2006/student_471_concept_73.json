      "student_answer": "To show fractions with a denominator of\u202f10 on a number line, you split the interval from\u202f0\u202fto\u202f1 into ten equal pieces.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. **Draw a horizontal line** and label the left\u2011most point\u202f0 and the right\u2011most point\u202f1.  \n2. **Divide the segment into 10 equal parts.**  \n   - The length of each part is \\(\\frac{1-0}{10}=0.1\\).  \n3. **Mark the division points** and write the corresponding fractions (or decimals) beneath them:\n\n| Mark | Fraction | Decimal |\n|------|----------|---------|\n| 0    | \\(0/10\\) | 0.0 |\n| 0.1  | \\(1/10\\) | 0.1 |\n| 0.2  | \\(2/10\\) | 0.2 |\n| 0.3  | \\(3/10\\) | 0.3 |\n| 0.4  | \\(4/10\\) | 0.4 |\n| 0.5  | \\(5/10\\) | 0.5 |\n| 0.6  | \\(6/10\\) | 0.6 |\n| 0.7  | \\(7/10\\) | 0.7 |\n| 0.8  | \\(8/10\\) | 0.8 |\n| 0.9  | \\(9/10\\) | 0.9 |\n| 1    | \\(10/10\\) | 1.0 |\n\nNow each tick represents one\u2011tenth of the whole, so any fraction with denominator\u202f10 (e.g.,\u202f\\(3/10\\), \\(7/10\\)) can be located directly on the line."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain how the denominator of a fraction affects the number of divisions on a number line.",
      "student_answer": "The denominator tells you into how many **equal parts** the whole unit (the segment from\u202f0 to\u202f1) must be split.  \n- If the denominator is\u202f2, the unit is cut into two equal pieces, so the number line will show the points 0,\u202f\u00bd,\u202f1.  \n- If the denominator is\u202f4, the unit is cut into four equal pieces, giving the points 0,\u202f\u00bc,\u202f\u00bd,\u202f\u00be,\u202f1.  \n- In general, a denominator of\u202f\\(d\\) means the distance from 0 to 1 is divided into **\\(d\\) equal segments** (and therefore there are \\(d+1\\) equally\u2011spaced points including the endpoints).\n\nThus a larger denominator creates **more, finer divisions** on the number line, while a smaller denominator creates fewer, coarser divisions. This is why fractions with bigger denominators (like \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\)) appear closer together on the line than fractions with smaller denominators (like \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\))."

      "student_answer": "The denominator tells you how many equal pieces the whole unit (the distance from\u202f0\u202fto\u202f1\u202fon the number line) is split into.  \nSo if the fraction has denominator\u202f\\(d\\), the segment from\u202f0\u202fto\u202f1\u202fis divided into\u202f\\(d\\)\u202fequal divisions, and each division represents one\u2011\\(d^{\\text{th}}\\) ( \\(\\frac{1}{d}\\) ) of the whole.  For example, a denominator of\u202f4 means the unit interval is broken into\u20114 equal parts, each marking a step of \\(\\frac14\\)."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How could you divide a number line to represent fractions with denominators of both 2 and 4?",
      "student_answer": "To show both \u00bd\u2011fractions and \u00bc\u2011fractions on the same line, start with the unit segment\u202f0\u2006\u2013\u20061 and split it into **four equal parts**.\n\n1. **Mark the quarters:**  \n   - 0\u2003\u2192\u20031\u20444\u2003\u2192\u20032\u20444\u2003\u2192\u20033\u20444\u2003\u2192\u20031  \n\n2. **Identify the halves:**  \n   - The points that are two quarters apart are the halves:  \n     - 0\u2003\u2192\u20032\u20444 (which is the same as\u202f\u00bd)\u2003\u2192\u20031  \n\nSo the number line is divided into four equal divisions. Each division represents a\u202f\u00bc\u2011unit, and every second division (0,\u202f2\u20444,\u202f1) also represents a\u202f\u00bd\u2011unit. This way the line simultaneously displays fractions with denominators\u202f2 (\u00bd) and\u202f4 (\u00bc,\u202f2\u20444,\u202f3\u20444)."
