Three of those parts together make **3\u202f\u00d7\u202f(1\u20446) = 3\u20446**, which is exactly halfway between\u202f0\u202fand\u202f1.\n\n---\n\n### Why 3\u20446 = 1\u20442\n\nTo see that\u202f3\u20446\u202fis the same as\u202f1\u20442, simplify the fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{6} \\;\\; \\text{divide numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, 3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{3\\div 3}{6\\div 3} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nBoth fractions describe the same point on the number line\u2014the midpoint between\u202f0\u202fand\u202f1. So the label **3\u20446** on the line coincides with the label **1\u20442**, showing that the two fractions are equivalent."

Draw a number line with\u202f0\u202fat the left end and\u202f1\u202fat the right end.  \n2. Divide the segment from\u202f0\u202fto\u202f1\u202finto\u202f4 equal parts. The third tick mark from\u202f0\u202frepresents\u202f\\( \\frac34 \\).  \n3. To show the equivalent fraction\u202f\\( \\frac68 \\), divide the same segment into\u202f8 equal parts instead of\u202f4. The sixth tick mark (\u2011\u2011\u2011\u2011\u2011\u2011) lands exactly on the same spot as the third\u2011quarter mark, confirming that\u202f\\( \\frac68 \\) is the same point as\u202f\\( \\frac34 \\).  \n4. For\u202f\\( \\frac9{12} \\), split the segment into\u202f12 equal parts; the ninth tick mark coincides with the same location.  \n\nThus, whether we use\u202f\\( \\frac34 \\),\u202f\\( \\frac68 \\), or\u202f\\( \\frac9{12} \\) (or the mistakenly listed\u202f\\( \\frac56 \\) that actually sits elsewhere), the first two fractions land on the same point on the number line, illustrating their equivalence."
