      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "If a square is divided into 4 equal parts, how many smaller squares are formed?",
      "student_answer": "The square would be divided into **4** equal smaller squares."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "A square is divided into 9 equal sections. What shape are the sections?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the 9 equal sections is itself a **square**."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "There would be **4 rows** and **4 columns** of the smaller squares."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "A square is divided into 25 equal parts. How many parts are in each row?",
      "student_answer": "The square is split into a 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 grid, so there are **5 parts in each row**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into more equal sections, each individual part becomes **smaller** \u2013 its area (and side length, if the parts are also squares) decreases in proportion to the number of pieces. In other words, the more equal sections you create, the less area each one occupies."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "If a square is divided horizontally and vertically into 4 equal sections, what is the shape of each section?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the four pieces is a smaller **square** \u2013 the original square is split into four equal\u2011sized squares."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013 a square can be split up into equal triangles. The easiest way to see this is to draw a diagonal across the square. The diagonal cuts the square into two congruent right\u2011angled triangles, each having the same side lengths (half the side of the square as the base, the full side as the height, and the diagonal as the hypotenuse).\n\nYou can also divide the square into four equal triangles by drawing *both* diagonals. The two diagonals intersect at the centre of the square and create four congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles. Each of these triangles has legs equal to half the side of the original square and a hypotenuse that is the same for all four.\n\nIn general, any time you can partition a shape into smaller shapes of the same size and shape, the total area will be preserved, so the square can indeed be tiled by equal triangles. (What you cannot do is tile a square completely with **equilateral** triangles of one size, because the 60\u00b0 angles of an equilateral triangle don\u2019t fit together to fill the 90\u00b0 corners of a square without leaving gaps.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "The square is split into a \\(6 \\times 6\\) grid (since \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\)).  \nTherefore each smaller square\u2019s side length is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{6}=2.\n\\]\n\n**Answer:\u202f2 units**."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is cut into several **equal rectangles**, each piece keeps the same shape as every other piece, but the shape is a rectangle, not a square.  \n\nA square has all four sides the same length, so its side\u2011to\u2011side ratio is 1\u202f:\u202f1.  \nA rectangle, on the other hand, has two long sides and two short sides, so its length\u2011to\u2011width ratio is something other than 1\u202f:\u202f1 (for example 2\u202f:\u202f1, 3\u202f:\u202f1, etc.).  \n\nIf you divide a square by drawing parallel cuts that are all parallel to one pair of sides, each piece will have the full height of the original square but only a fraction of its width. The height and width of each piece are therefore different, giving a ratio that is not 1\u202f:\u202f1. Because the resulting pieces do **not** have equal side lengths, they are rectangles, not squares.  \n\n(The only way you could still get squares is if you cut the original square into just one piece\u2014i.e., you don\u2019t cut it at all.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Draw a square divided into 9 equal sections and label the dimensions of each smaller square if the original square has a side length of 3 units.",
      "student_answer": "Here is a description of the figure and the required dimensions.\n\n**Figure description**\n\n- Start with a large square whose side length is **3\u202funits**.  \n- Draw two equally\u2011spaced vertical lines and two equally\u2011spaced horizontal lines inside the large square.  \n- The lines divide the big square into a **3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid**, giving **9 smaller squares** of equal size.\n\n**Dimensions of each smaller square**\n\nSince the large square is 3\u202funits on a side and it is split into 3 equal parts along each direction, the side length of each little square is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3\\text{ units}}{3}=1\\text{ unit}.\n\\]\n\nSo every one of the nine small squares is a **1\u202funit\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202funit** square.\n\n---\n\n**Simple ASCII sketch (just to illustrate the layout)**  \n\n```\n+---+---+---+   each small square = 1 unit \u00d7 1 unit\n|   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+\n|   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+\n|   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+\n```\n\n**Labeling (as you would write on the drawing)**  \n\n- Write \u201c3\u202funits\u201d along the outer side of the big square.  \n- Inside each of the nine cells, you can label the side as \u201c1\u202funit\u201d.  \n\nThus the original 3\u2011unit square is neatly divided into nine equal 1\u2011unit\u2011by\u20111\u2011unit squares."
