      "student_answer": "To find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 12 and 18 you can list the factors of each number and then pick the largest one they share.\n\n**Step\u202f1 \u2013 List the factors**\n\n- Factors of 12:\u20031,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f12  \n- Factors of 18:\u20031,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f18  \n\n**Step\u202f2 \u2013 Identify the common factors**\n\nThe numbers that appear in both lists are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202fand\u202f6.\n\n**Step\u202f3 \u2013 Choose the greatest one**\n\nThe largest common factor is **6**.\n\nSo, the GCF of 12 and 18 is **6**. (One quick check: 12\u202f\u00f7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f2 and 18\u202f\u00f7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f3, both giving whole numbers, confirming 6 is indeed the GCF.)"

      "question": "Explain how the GCF helps in dividing items into equal groups.",
      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) tells you the biggest size that a group can have while still letting you split two (or more) collections of items into exactly the same number of groups with no leftovers.  \n\nFor example, if you have 12 apples and 18 oranges, the GCF of\u202f12\u202fand\u202f18\u202fis\u202f6.  That means you can arrange the fruit into **6 equal groups** \u2013 each group would contain\u202f2\u202fapples (12\u202f\u00f7\u202f6) and\u202f3\u202foranges (18\u202f\u00f7\u202f6).  Because 6 is the largest number that works for both counts, you can\u2019t make more than 6 groups without ending up with a remainder.\n\nSo, when you\u2019re trying to divide items into equal groups, you first find the GCF of the numbers you\u2019re working with.  The GCF gives you the **largest possible number of groups** (or, equivalently, the smallest possible size of each group) that will let every item be used up evenly.  \n\nI think this is why teachers often ask you to use the GCF \u2013 it guarantees that the groups you form will be as big as they can be while still being completely equal.  (Sometimes people say the GCF gives the \u201csmallest number of groups,\u201d but actually it gives the **largest** number of groups that works for all the items.)"

Each kit would then contain  \n\n*\u202f48 \u00f7 12 = **4** granola bars  \n*\u202f60 \u00f7 12 = **5** juice boxes  \n\nBecause the GCF gives the largest number that divides both totals evenly, it tells you the biggest group size you can use without any leftovers.  \n\n(If you chose a smaller factor, like 4, you\u2019d end up with more kits\u201412\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 = 48 kits\u2014but each kit would have fewer items; the GCF just gives the **largest** convenient group.)  \n\nSo, finding the GCF helps you organize the snacks into the maximum\u2011size, equal kits, making the packing process quick and waste\u2011free."
