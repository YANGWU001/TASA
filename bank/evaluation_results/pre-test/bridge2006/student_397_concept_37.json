  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of counting shaded parts in squares, correctly identifying the number of shaded sections in most cases. However, there were minor misunderstandings in Question 4 regarding the request for shaded parts and in Question 9 where the answer did not reflect the correct count of shaded sections. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the concept.",
