      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "I think a square **can** be broken up into equal\u2011sized triangles.  \nFor example, if you draw one of the diagonals you split the square into two congruent right\u2011angled triangles. If you draw both diagonals you get four congruent (isosceles\u2011right) triangles.  \n\nThe reason this works is that the triangles together still cover the whole area of the square, and because each diagonal divides the square into two regions that have the same base length and the same height, the two pieces have the same area. The same idea extends to more pieces if you keep the divisions symmetrical.  \n\nSo, unlike dividing a square into smaller squares (which needs the side lengths to be factors of the original side), you can certainly divide a square into equal triangles by using its diagonals or other symmetric cuts."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When you cut a square into several **identical rectangles**, each piece has the same length\u2011to\u2011width ratio as the other pieces, but that ratio is usually **different from 1** (the ratio that makes a shape a square).\n\n- A square\u2019s sides are all equal, so its side\u2011ratio is 1\u202f:\u202f1.  \n- If you split the square with a single set of parallel cuts (for example, three vertical cuts that make four pieces), each piece will be a rectangle whose width is the original side divided by the number of pieces, while the height stays the same as the original side.  \n  - So the new width\u202f=\u202f(original side)\u202f\u00f7\u202f4, but the height\u202f=\u202f(original side).  \n  - The resulting width\u2011to\u2011height ratio is therefore \u00bc\u202f:\u202f1, not 1\u202f:\u202f1, so the pieces are rectangles, not squares.\n\nEven if you cut the square both horizontally **and** vertically, the only way to keep the pieces square is to cut it into a grid where the number of rows equals the number of columns (e.g., a 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 or 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid). In those special cases each small piece **does** end up being a square because the cuts divide both dimensions into the same number of equal parts.  \n\nSo, in general, dividing a square into equal rectangles changes the proportion of the sides, making the side lengths unequal, and that is why the resulting parts are rectangles rather than squares. \n\n*(I think this captures the main idea\u2014if you cut only in one direction, the pieces can\u2019t stay square because their side lengths become different.)*"
