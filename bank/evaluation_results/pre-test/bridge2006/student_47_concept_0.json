      "question": "If you multiply 7 by 6, how does the result compare to multiplying 8 by 5?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f6 is 48 and 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 is 40, so the product of 7 and 6 is the larger one."

      "question": "What is the larger product: 3 x 9 or 2 x 12?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the larger product is **2\u202f\u00d7\u202f12**."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Compare: Is 10 x 3 larger than 7 x 4?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think maybe 10\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 isn\u2019t larger than 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f4."

      "question": "A farmer planted 4 rows of 9 trees each. Another farmer planted 6 rows of 7 trees each. Who planted more trees?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the first farmer has 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f36 trees, and the second farmer has 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f42 trees. So the second farmer planted more trees."

      "question": "Two teams scored points in a game. Team A scored 6 points in each of 8 games while Team B scored 5 points in each of 10 games. Which team scored higher?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think Team\u202fA scored the higher total.  Six points a game for eight games is\u2026 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f48, and Team\u202fB\u2019s 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 is\u2026 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f45, so I guess Team\u202fA has the bigger score."

      "question": "Compare the results of these multiplications: 20 x 3 versus 25 x 2. Which is larger?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 let\u2019s see. 20 times 3 is\u2026 maybe 50? And 25 times 2 is\u2026 probably 60? So I guess the bigger one is **25\u202f\u00d7\u202f2**."
