      "question": "Explain why finding a common denominator is necessary when adding fractions.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason we need a common denominator when we add fractions is\u2026 well, so that the denominators match up, right? If the bottoms are the same, we can just add the top numbers together and keep that shared bottom. Like, if we have 1/4 + 3/8, we\u2019d change 1/4 to something over 8 so the denominators are the same, and then we can just add the numerators.  \n\nI guess another way to look at it is that having the same denominator lets us compare the sizes of the fractions more easily, so we know which one is bigger before we add them. And\u2026 maybe it also makes the math simpler because we don\u2019t have to do any extra multiplication with different bottoms.  \n\nSo, basically, a common denominator lines up the \u201cparts\u201d of the whole so we can just add the parts (the numerators) directly."
