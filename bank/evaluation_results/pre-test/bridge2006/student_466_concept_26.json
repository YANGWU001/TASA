      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) \u2013 also called the greatest common divisor (GCD) \u2013 is the **largest whole number that divides each of the given integers with no remainder**. In other words, it\u2019s the biggest factor that the numbers all share. For example, the GCF of 12 and\u202f18 is 6, because 6 is the biggest number that fits evenly into both 12 and 18. This concept is useful for simplifying fractions, reducing ratios, and solving problems that involve common divisibility."
