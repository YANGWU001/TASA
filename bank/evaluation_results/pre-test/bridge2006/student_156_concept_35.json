      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "If a square is divided into 4 equal parts, how many smaller squares are formed?",
      "student_answer": "The square is split into four equal parts, so it creates **4 smaller squares**."
    },

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "A square is divided into 9 equal sections. What shape are the sections?",
      "student_answer": "The square is divided into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, so each of the nine equal sections is itself a **square**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into 16 equal smaller squares, the divisions form a **4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 grid**.  \nSo there are **4 rows** and **4 columns** of the smaller squares."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "A square is divided into 25 equal parts. How many parts are in each row?",
      "student_answer": "The square is divided into a \\(5 \\times 5\\) grid, so there are **5 parts in each row**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is split into more equal sections, the total area of the square stays the same, so each individual piece must occupy a smaller portion of that area. In other words, **the size (area) of each part gets smaller as the number of equal parts increases**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "If a square is divided horizontally and vertically into 4 equal sections, what is the shape of each section?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the four sections is itself a **smaller square** (each one\u2011quarter the size of the original)."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer: Yes \u2013 a square can be divided into equal (congruent) triangles.**\n\nA square is a special kind of rectangle, and any rectangle can be cut along a diagonal to produce two right\u2011angled triangles that are mirror images of each other. Because the diagonal runs from one corner of the square to the opposite corner, the two resulting triangles have exactly the same side lengths and the same area, so they are equal.\n\nMore than two triangles are also possible. For example:\n\n* **Four equal triangles:** Draw both diagonals of the square. The intersecting point is the center, and the square is split into four right\u2011angled triangles, each with legs equal to half the side of the original square.\n* **Six or any even number of equal triangles:** By first dividing the square into strips (e.g., drawing a line parallel to one side) and then cutting each strip with a diagonal, you can create any even number of congruent right\u2011angled triangles.\n* **Any number of equal\u2011area triangles (not necessarily congruent):** By using more elaborate constructions (such as connecting points on the sides that partition the perimeter into equal segments), a square can be dissected into any desired number of triangles that all have the same area, even if the shapes differ.\n\nThus, there is no geometric rule that forces a square to be divided only into smaller squares; equal\u2011triangle dissections are perfectly valid, and they are often used in tiling, proofs, and design."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "The 36 equal squares must be arranged in a \\(6 \\times 6\\) grid because \\(\\sqrt{36}=6\\).  \nSo each side of the original square is split into 6 equal segments:\n\n\\[\n\\text{side of each small square}= \\frac{12}{6}=2.\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is cut into pieces that are **equal rectangles**, the cuts are made so that each piece has the same length\u2011wise dimension and the same width\u2011wise dimension as every other piece.  \n\nA square\u2019s defining property is that its two sides are **identical** in length.  \nIf we slice the square with a line that is **parallel to one side**, each piece will keep the full length of the other side but will have a shorter length in the direction of the cut. In other words, the two dimensions of each piece are no longer equal:\n\n* **Original square:** side\u202f=\u202f\\(s\\) and side\u202f=\u202f\\(s\\) (so the ratio of length to width is 1\u202f:\u202f1).  \n* **After dividing:** each piece has dimensions \\(s\\) (the unchanged side) by \\(s/n\\) (the shortened side), where \\(n\\) is the number of equal pieces along that direction.\n\nSince the length and width of each piece differ (the ratio is \\(n\\)\u202f:\u202f1, not 1\u202f:\u202f1), the pieces satisfy the definition of a **rectangle** (a quadrilateral with opposite sides equal) but **not** the stricter definition of a **square** (a rectangle whose adjacent sides are also equal).\n\nOnly if the division is made in a way that preserves equal side lengths\u2014e.g., cutting the square into a grid of smaller squares (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2, 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3, etc.)\u2014will the resulting parts be squares. In the general case of \u201cequal rectangles,\u201d the aspect ratio changes, so the parts are rectangles, not squares."

      "student_answer": "Here is a sketch of the original square (side\u202f=\u202f3\u202funits) divided into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, giving 9 equal smaller squares:\n\n```\n+-------+-------+-------+\n|       |       |       |\n|  1\u00d71  |  1\u00d71  |  1\u00d71  |\n|       |       |       |\n+-------+-------+-------+\n|       |       |       |\n|  1\u00d71  |  1\u00d71  |  1\u00d71  |\n|       |       |       |\n+-------+-------+-------+\n|       |       |       |\n|  1\u00d71  |  1\u00d71  |  1\u00d71  |\n|       |       |       |\n+-------+-------+-------+\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n\n* The original square has side length\u202f3\u202funits.  \n* Dividing it into 3 equal parts along each side creates a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid.  \n* Each small square therefore has side length  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{3\\text{ units}}{3}=1\\text{ unit}.\n\\]\n\n*Hence every small square measures **1\u202funit\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202funit**.*"
