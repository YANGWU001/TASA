However, there were some misunderstandings in Questions 6 and 10 regarding the definition of contiguous shaded parts, leading to incorrect answers. Overall, the student is proficient in this topic.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "If a vertical bar is divided into 10 equal parts and 4 parts are shaded, how many shaded parts are there?",
      "student_answer": "There are **4 shaded parts**. The bar is split into 10 equal sections, and 4 of those sections are marked as shaded, so the count of shaded parts is simply 4."
    },

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "A vertical bar is divided into 8 equal sections. If 5 sections are shaded, count the number of shaded parts.",
      "student_answer": "The number of shaded parts is **5**."
    },

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Look at the vertical bar divided into 12 equal parts, where 7 parts are shaded. How many shaded parts are there?",
      "student_answer": "The bar shows 7 of its 12 equal parts shaded, so there are **7 shaded parts**."
    },

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If a vertical bar shows 6 shaded parts out of 15 sections, how many shaded parts are contiguous?",
      "student_answer": "All\u202f6 of the shaded parts are contiguous."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "A vertical bar is divided into 20 segments, and 10 consecutive parts are shaded. How many shaded parts are there?",
      "student_answer": "The bar has 20 equal segments. Since the shading is described as \u201c10 consecutive parts,\u201d exactly those 10 segments are shaded.\n\n**Number of shaded parts = 10**."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If a vertical bar has 18 sections with 6 shaded parts in a row, what is the count of shaded parts?",
      "student_answer": "The bar contains **6 shaded parts**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "A vertical bar shows 4 shaded parts out of 10 total sections. Are all shaded parts contiguous? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:**\u202fNo, the four shaded parts are **not** all contiguous.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nIn a vertical bar each section is either shaded or unshaded. For the shaded parts to be contiguous, they would have to occupy consecutive sections with no unshaded sections in between. Since the bar contains 10 sections and only 4 are shaded, there must be at least one unshaded section separating some of the shaded ones (otherwise the shading would fill 4 consecutive sections and the remaining 6 would all be unshaded, which would be evident as a single block of four shaded sections). The presence of any gap means the shaded parts are not all next to each other, so they are not contiguous."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "In a bar divided into 12 parts, 8 parts are shaded consecutively. How many shaded parts are there?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 8 shaded parts."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "A vertical bar is divided into 16 parts, where 5 shaded parts are non-contiguous. How does this affect the count of contiguous shaded sections?",
      "student_answer": "Because the five shaded pieces are **not touching each other**, each one forms its own separate block. In a count\u2011of\u2011contiguous\u2011shaded\u2011sections problem, any isolated shaded piece is counted as a distinct contiguous segment.  \n\n**Therefore, the bar contains\u202f5\u202fcontiguous shaded sections** (one for each of the five non\u2011contiguous shaded parts)."
