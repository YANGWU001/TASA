  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of LCM concepts, correctly identifying the LCM in most cases. However, there are some misunderstandings, particularly in questions 2, 7, and 10, where the student incorrectly identifies the LCM due to confusion about multiples and factors. Overall, the student shows good reasoning skills but needs to clarify the definitions and relationships between multiples and factors.",

The smallest positive number that both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) divide is therefore the larger number \\(a\\) itself. In other words, the least common multiple of two numbers where one is a multiple of the other is just the larger (the multiple) because it already contains all the prime factors of the smaller number."

I listed a few multiples of 12:\u202f12,\u202f24,\u202f36,\u202f48,\u202f\u2026\n2. I also listed some multiples of 36:\u202f36,\u202f72,\u202f108,\u202f\u2026\n3. I looked for the smallest number that appears in both lists.  \n   The first multiple of\u202f12\u202fthat seemed to line up with a multiple of\u202f36 was\u202f24\u202f(\u2011\u2011\u2011 I was thinking of \u201c2\u202f\u00d7\u202f12 = 24\u201d and that 24 might also be a factor of\u202f36, even though it isn\u2019t a full multiple).  \n4. Since 24 is a multiple of 12 and I thought it also works for 36, I concluded that 24 must be the LCM.\n\nSo, based on that reasoning, my answer is 24.

The next smallest number that both 7 and 21 divide into is 21 itself:\n\n- 21\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f3  \n- 21\u202f\u00f7\u202f21\u202f=\u202f1  \n\nTherefore the LCM of 7 and 21 is **21**, not 7."
