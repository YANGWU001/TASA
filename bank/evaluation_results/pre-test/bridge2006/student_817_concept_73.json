  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of how the denominator of a fraction relates to the number of equal divisions on a number line. Most answers are correct, but there are a couple of misconceptions, such as the incorrect denominator identified in Question 7. Overall, the student shows a good grasp of the concepts involved.",

      "question": "How would you divide a number line to represent fractions with a denominator of 10?",
      "student_answer": "To show fractions with a denominator of\u202f10, you would split each whole\u2011unit segment of the number line into **ten equal parts**.  \n\nSo, starting at 0 and moving to 1, mark off points at 0.1,\u202f0.2,\u202f0.3, \u2026,\u202f0.9, and then 1.0. Each little segment represents one\u2011tenth (\u202f\\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)\u202f), and any point you label\u2014like 0.4 or 0.7\u2014corresponds to the fractions \\( \\frac{4}{10} \\) and \\( \\frac{7}{10} \\) respectively.  \n\nIn short, **divide each unit interval into ten equal divisions** and label the division marks accordingly."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain how the denominator of a fraction affects the number of divisions on a number line.",
      "student_answer": "I think the denominator tells you how many equal pieces you have to split the whole segment of the number line (usually the interval from\u202f0\u202fto\u202f1) into.  \nSo, for a fraction like\u202f\\(\\frac{3}{5}\\), the \u201c5\u201d means you would divide the line between\u202f0\u202fand\u202f1 into\u202f5\u202fequal parts, each representing one\u2011fifth. You then count three of those parts to locate\u202f\\(\\frac{3}{5}\\).  \n\nIn general, a larger denominator means more (and therefore smaller) divisions, while a smaller denominator gives fewer, larger divisions. The numerator just tells you which of those equal divisions you\u2019re looking at. Probably that\u2019s why the denominator is the key factor in deciding the number of equal marks you draw on the line."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Describe the relationship between the denominator of a fraction and the number of equal divisions on the number line.",
      "student_answer": "The denominator tells you how many equal parts the whole interval is split into on the number line, so if the denominator is\u202f4 you would divide the segment from\u202f0\u202fto\u202f1 into\u202f4\u202fequal pieces.  \n\nI think each piece is then\u202f1\u202fover the denominator long (for a denominator of\u202f4 each piece is\u202f\u00bc\u202funits), and those pieces are the \u201cticks\u2019\u2019 that show the possible fractions.  \n\nSometimes I get mixed up and think the denominator also tells you the total length of each division, but actually it\u2019s the number of divisions \u2013 the size of each division comes from the numerator (e.g.,\u202f3\u20444\u202freaches the third tick).  \n\nSo, in short, the denominator\u202f=\u202fnumber of equal divisions on the number line (though I\u2019m not completely sure about the exact role of the numerator in positioning the fraction)."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How could you divide a number line to represent fractions with denominators of both 2 and 4?",
      "student_answer": "To show both \u00bd\u2011parts and \u00bc\u2011parts on the same line you can just split the line into **four equal sections**.\n\n1. **Mark the endpoints** (0 and 1, for example).  \n2. **Divide the distance between them into four equal jumps**.  \n   - Each jump is a\u202f\u00bc, so the points you get are \u00bc, \u00bd, \u00be, and 1.  \n3. The **mid\u2011point** (the second tick) is also the point that splits the line in half, so it represents \u00bd.  \n\nThus the four equally\u2011spaced marks give you the quarters (denominator\u202f4), and the midpoint among them gives you the halves (denominator\u202f2) without needing any extra divisions."
