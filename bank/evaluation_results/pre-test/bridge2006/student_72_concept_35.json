      "student_answer": "The square is divided into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, so each of the 9 equal sections is itself a **smaller square**."

      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "There would be **4 rows** and **4 columns** of the smaller squares (a 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 grid)."

      "question": "A square is divided into 25 equal parts. How many parts are in each row?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer: 5**  \n\nWhen a square is divided into 25 equal smaller squares, it forms a 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 grid. Therefore each row (and each column) contains 5 parts."

      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When you divide a square into more equal sections, the total area of the square stays the same, so each individual part must become **smaller**. In other words, as the number of equal pieces increases, the size (area) of each piece decreases."

      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Yes \u2013 a square can be divided into equal (congruent) triangles.**  \n\nThe only requirement for a division (or \u201ctiling\u201d) is that the pieces completely cover the square without gaps or overlaps. A triangle meets that requirement just as a smaller square does, so we can partition a square into identical triangles in many ways.  \n\n### Simple examples  \n\n1. **Two right\u2011triangle pieces** \u2013 Draw one of the square\u2019s diagonals.  \n   * The diagonal splits the square into two right\u2011angled isosceles triangles.  \n   * Both triangles have the same legs (the sides of the original square) and the same hypotenuse (the diagonal), so they are congruent.\n\n2. **Four right\u2011triangle pieces** \u2013 Draw both diagonals, which intersect at the centre.  \n   * The square is now four congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles, each having one side of the original square as a leg and half a diagonal as the other leg.\n\n3. **Eight or more triangles** \u2013 Subdivide each of the four triangles above again by drawing a line from the centre to the midpoint of each side, or by repeatedly bisecting the existing triangles. All the resulting pieces are still equal to one another.\n\n### Why it works  \n\n* **Area:** The total area of the square is the sum of the areas of the triangles. If each triangle has area\u202f\\(A\\) and there are \\(n\\) triangles, then \\(nA =\\) (area of the square). By choosing a construction where each triangle\u2019s area is \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) of the square\u2019s area, the pieces will fit perfectly.  \n* **Angles:** In a square the interior angles are \\(90^\\circ\\). When a diagonal is drawn, each resulting triangle has interior angles \\(45^\\circ\\), \\(45^\\circ\\), and \\(90^\\circ\\); the four\u2011triangle version gives each triangle angles \\(45^\\circ\\), \\(45^\\circ\\), and \\(90^\\circ\\) as well. The angles line up along the shared edges, so there are no gaps or overlaps.  \n* **Edge matching:** The sides of each triangle either lie along a side of the original square or along a line that is shared with another triangle (the diagonals). Because the triangles are congruent, each shared side has the same length on both sides, guaranteeing a seamless tiling.\n\n### Conclusion  \n\nA square need not be divided only into smaller squares; it can equally well be partitioned into congruent triangles. The simplest method is to draw one or both diagonals, giving two or four equal right\u2011isosceles triangles, but many other constructions are possible. The key is that the triangles together exactly fill the square\u2019s area and match up along their edges, which they do in these constructions."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "The original square has side length\u202f12.  \nDividing it into 36 equal smaller squares means arranging them in a \\(6 \\times 6\\) grid (since \\(\\sqrt{36}=6\\)).  \n\nTherefore each small square\u2019s side length is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{6}=2.\n\\]\n\n**Answer:\u202f2 (units).**"

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is cut into several equal **rectangles**, each piece keeps the same overall shape as the others, but its dimensions are no longer equal in length and width.  \n\nA square has the defining property that its two sides are the same length (side\u202f=\u202fside).\u202fIf we divide the square by drawing straight lines that are parallel to one pair of opposite sides, we create strips whose height is the original side length of the square, while their width is only a fraction of that length (the original side divided by the number of strips). Because the height and width of each strip are different, each piece is a rectangle, not a square.  \n\nEven if we divide the square with a grid (both vertical and horizontal lines) to make a set of smaller shapes, the only way for every piece to remain a square is for the grid spacing to be the same in both directions. If the spacing is different\u2014say the vertical lines are spaced farther apart than the horizontal lines\u2014then each small piece will have unequal side lengths, again giving rectangles.  \n\nIn summary, the act of \u201cequal division\u201d fixes the **area** of each piece, but unless the division keeps the side lengths equal in both directions, the resulting parts have unequal side lengths and therefore are rectangles, not squares."
