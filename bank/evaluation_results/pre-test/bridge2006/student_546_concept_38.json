      "student_answer": "To split a circle into five identical pieces you need each slice to span an angle of  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{360^\\circ}{5}=72^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nHere\u2019s a step\u2011by\u2011step way to do it with a ruler, a compass and a protractor (or any drawing software that lets you measure angles).\n\n1. **Draw the circle**  \n   - Place the compass point at a chosen centre and draw a clean circle.\n\n2. **Mark a starting radius**  \n   - Draw a straight line from the centre to any point on the circumference.  Call this line \\(OA\\).  This will be the first dividing line.\n\n3. **Set the protractor**  \n   - Place the centre of the protractor at the circle\u2019s centre, aligning the \\(0^\\circ\\) (or \\(360^\\circ\\)) mark with the line \\(OA\\).\n\n4. **Mark successive 72\u00b0 angles**  \n   - From the \\(0^\\circ\\) line, count \\(72^\\circ\\) on the protractor and make a tiny mark on the circle\u2019s edge.  \n   - Draw a radius from the centre through that mark; label the endpoint \\(B\\).  \n   - Repeat: from the \\(0^\\circ\\) line count \\(144^\\circ\\) (or from the previous mark add another \\(72^\\circ\\)) and draw radius \\(OC\\).  \n   - Continue for \\(216^\\circ\\) (radius \\(OD\\)) and \\(288^\\circ\\) (radius \\(OE\\)).\n\n5. **Check the divisions**  \n   - You should now have five radii \\(OA, OB, OC, OD, OE\\) that are spaced exactly \\(72^\\circ\\) apart.  \n   - All five sectors will have the same central angle, so they are congruent.\n\n6. **(Optional) Shade or label the sectors**  \n   - If you need the sections to be visually distinct, lightly shade each sector or label them 1\u20115.\n\n### Quick alternative (no protractor)\n\nIf a protractor isn\u2019t handy, you can use the **compass\u2011and\u2011arc method**:\n\n1. Draw the circle and its centre \\(O\\).  \n2. Choose a point \\(A\\) on the circumference and set the compass width to the radius.  \n3. With the compass point at \\(A\\), mark an arc that cuts the circle at a new point \\(B\\).  \n4. Without changing the compass width, move the compass point to \\(B\\) and mark the next intersection \\(C\\).  \n5. Continue this \u201cstepping\u2011stone\u201d process five times; the final point should land back at \\(A\\) (or very close, because a perfect 5\u2011division isn\u2019t possible with just a fixed radius).  \n6. Connect each of the five points to the centre; the resulting sectors are equal in arc length, which also makes them equal in area.\n\nThe protractor method guarantees the exact 72\u00b0 angle, while the compass\u2011stepping method gives an approximate division that is usually sufficient for quick sketches."

      "student_answer": "**How to divide a circle into equal sections**\n\n1. **Identify the centre** of the circle (the point from which every point on the circumference is the same distance).  \n2. **Choose a starting point** on the circumference. Mark this point and draw a straight line (a radius) from the centre to the point. This line will be the first \u201ccut.\u201d\n3. **Determine the size of each angle** you need.  \n   - A full circle contains **360\u00b0**.  \n   - If you want the circle split into *n* equal parts, each part will have an angle of  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Angle per part} = \\frac{360^\\circ}{n}.\n\\]\n\n4. **Mark the angles** around the centre:  \n   - Using a protractor (or a compass\u2011and\u2011ruler construction) measure the angle from the first radius and make a small mark on the circumference.  \n   - Draw a second radius from the centre through that mark.  \n   - Continue this step, adding the same angle each time, until you return to the starting point. You will have drawn *n* radii, which divide the circle into *n* equal sectors.\n\n5. **Check your work**: the sum of all the sector angles should add up to 360\u00b0 (or the number of drawn radii should equal the intended number of sections).\n\n---\n\n### Example: 9 equal divisions\n\n- **Number of sections (n)**: 9  \n- **Angle per section**:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{360^\\circ}{9} = 40^\\circ.\n\\]\n\nSo each of the nine sectors will have an interior angle of **40 degrees** at the centre.\n\n**Steps for the 9\u2011division case**\n\n1. Draw the first radius.\n2. From that radius, measure **40\u00b0** clockwise (or counter\u2011clockwise) and draw the second radius.\n3. Repeat the 40\u00b0 measurement eight more times. After the ninth radius you will be back at the starting point, completing the circle.\n\nYou now have a circle divided into **9 equal parts**, each sector spanning **40\u00b0**."
