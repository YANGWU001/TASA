  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of ability to interpret and analyze diagrams, as all answers except one indicate an inability to engage with the material without visual aids. The only correct answer is a general statement about the peak of a line graph, but it lacks a specific quantity. The student should focus on developing skills to interpret visual data independently.",

      "question": "Based on the diagram, how many units are indicated by the shaded area?",
      "student_answer": "I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t determine the number of units for the shaded area without seeing the diagram. Could you please provide the diagram or describe its dimensions?"

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "From the provided diagram, identify the numerical value shown at the highlighted point.",
      "student_answer": "I\u2019m sorry\u2014I can\u2019t see the diagram you\u2019re referring to. Could you describe the highlighted point or provide the numerical value shown in the image? Once I have that information, I\u2019ll be able to help you."

      "question": "Examine the graph and determine the quantity labeled at the intersection of the axes.",
      "student_answer": "I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t see the graph you\u2019re referring to. Could you describe the axes and the label shown at their intersection? With that information I\u2019ll be able to tell you the quantity."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Using the bar chart in the diagram, calculate the total quantity represented by all the bars combined.",
      "student_answer": "I\u2019m unable to calculate the total because the bar\u2011chart data aren\u2019t provided in the prompt. To find the combined quantity you\u2019d need the numeric value shown for each individual bar; once you have those values you simply add them together (\u2211\u202fbar\u202fvalues). If you can share the numbers from the diagram, I\u2019ll be happy to compute the total for you."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Look at the line graph in the diagram. What quantity is displayed at the peak of the line?",
      "student_answer": "The peak of the line represents the **maximum value of the measured quantity**\u2014i.e., the highest point shown on the graph\u2019s y\u2011axis."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Based on the scale provided in the diagram, what is the quantity corresponding to the marked point?",
      "student_answer": "I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t determine the quantity without seeing the diagram and its scale. If you can provide the diagram (or describe the scale and the location of the marked point), I\u2019ll be happy to calculate the corresponding value."
