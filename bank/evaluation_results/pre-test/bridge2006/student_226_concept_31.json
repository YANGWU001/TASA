      "question": "If a rectangle is divided by 5 evenly spaced vertical bars, how many equal sections are formed?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer: 5 equal sections**\n\n**Explanation:**  \nWhen a rectangle is cut by 5 vertical bars that are evenly spaced, each bar creates one separate strip. Because the bars are spaced uniformly, each strip has the same width, giving **5 equal sections** across the rectangle."

      "question": "Explain why placing 6 vertical bars in a rectangle results in 7 equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "When a rectangle is divided by vertical bars, each bar acts as a boundary that separates one region from the next.  \n\n1. **Start with the edges of the rectangle.**  \n   The left edge of the rectangle already defines the first \u201cborder.\u201d  \n\n2. **Add a vertical bar.**  \n   The first bar creates a second border, so the rectangle is now split into two strips.  \n\n3. **Add more bars one at a time.**  \n   Every additional vertical bar introduces one new border, which in turn creates one more strip.  \n\nBecause the bars are placed **equally spaced**, each new strip has the same width as the previous ones.  \n\nIf you place **6** vertical bars, you have:\n\n- the left edge (1 border)  \n- 6 bars (6 more borders)  \n- the right edge (the final border)\n\nThe total number of borders is \\(1 + 6 + 1 = 8\\).  \nThe number of regions (or equal divisions) is always one less than the number of borders, so\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of equal divisions} = 8 - 1 = 7.\n\\]\n\nThus, 6 vertical bars partition the rectangle into **7 equal vertical sections**. The equal spacing of the bars guarantees that each of the 7 sections has the same width."

      "student_answer": "The vertical bars are a visual way of showing how a shape has been split into equal parts.  \nEach bar marks one of those equal parts, so the total number of vertical bars you see is exactly the total number of equal divisions the shape contains.\n\n**In short:** *Number of vertical bars\u202f=\u202fNumber of equal divisions.*"

      "question": "Illustrate with an example how placing 10 vertical bars in a square creates multiple equal divisions.",
      "student_answer": "**Example**\n\n1. **Start with a square** whose side length is\u202f10\u202fcm.  \n2. **Draw 10 vertical bars** inside the square, spacing them evenly from the left side to the right side.  \n   - Place the first bar 1\u202fcm from the left edge, the second bar 2\u202fcm from the left edge, and continue this pattern until the tenth bar is 10\u202fcm from the left edge (i.e., right on the right\u2011hand edge).  \n3. **Resulting divisions**  \n   - Because the bars are equally spaced, the distance between any two neighboring bars (or between a bar and a side of the square) is **1\u202fcm**.  \n   - The square is therefore split into **10 vertical strips**, each with the same width (1\u202fcm) and the full height of the square (10\u202fcm).  \n\nIf you wanted even more divisions, you could add horizontal bars at the same 1\u202fcm intervals. Adding, say, 5 horizontal bars would turn the 10 vertical strips into a grid of **10\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f50 equal rectangles**.\n\n**Why this works**\n\n- The 10 vertical bars act as boundaries; each pair of successive bars (or a bar and the square\u2019s side) defines one region.  \n- Because the spacing is uniform, every region has the same dimensions, giving us multiple *equal* divisions.  \n\nSo, by placing 10 evenly spaced vertical bars inside a 10\u2011cm\u2011by\u201110\u2011cm square, we obtain 10 equal vertical divisions (or, with additional horizontal bars, many more equal pieces)."

      "student_answer": "**Formula**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of equal divisions }(D) = \\text{Number of vertical bars }(B) + 1\n\\]\n\n**Explanation**\n\nEach vertical bar adds one additional segment to the rectangle. Starting with a single undivided rectangle (0 bars \u2192 1 division), adding the first bar creates 2 equal parts, the second bar creates 3 parts, and so on. Therefore, with \\(B\\) vertical bars the rectangle is split into \\(B+1\\) equal vertical divisions.\n\nFor 12 vertical bars:\n\n\\[\nD = 12 + 1 = 13 \\text{ equal divisions}\n\\]"
