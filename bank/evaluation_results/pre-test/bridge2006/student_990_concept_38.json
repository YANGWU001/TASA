      "student_answer": "To cut a circle into five equal parts you need five central angles that are each one\u2011fifth of a full turn.\n\n1. **Draw the circle and a starting radius.**  \n   Place the compass point at the centre\u202f\\(O\\) and draw any radius \\(OA\\). This will be the first dividing line.\n\n2. **Determine the size of each angle.**  \n   A full circle is \\(360^\\circ\\).  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{360^\\circ}{5}=72^\\circ\n   \\]  \n   So every sector must have a central angle of \\(72^\\circ\\).\n\n3. **Mark the successive angles.**  \n   - Place a protractor (or a compass\u2011based angle\u2011copy tool) with its center at \\(O\\) and its 0\u2011\u00b0 line aligned with \\(OA\\).  \n   - Mark a point \\(B\\) on the circumference at \\(72^\\circ\\) from \\(OA\\).  \n   - From \\(OB\\) repeat the process: measure another \\(72^\\circ\\) (now at \\(144^\\circ\\) from the start) and mark point\u202f\\(C\\).  \n   - Continue for the third (\\(216^\\circ\\)), fourth (\\(288^\\circ\\)), and finally the fifth point (\\(360^\\circ\\) which lands back at the original point \\(A\\)).\n\n4. **Draw the division lines.**  \n   Connect the centre \\(O\\) to each of the five points \\(A, B, C, D, E\\) on the circumference. These five radii split the circle into five congruent sectors.\n\n**Alternative without a protractor**  \nIf a protractor isn\u2019t available, you can use a compass to \u201cstep off\u201d equal arcs:\n\n- Set the compass to any convenient radius and draw the circle.\n- Along the circumference, place the compass point at any point and make a small arc.\n- Without changing the compass width, move the point to the tip of the arc and mark the next arc.\n- Continue \u201cwalking\u201d around the circle; after five steps you should land back at the start (or very close). Join each of those five points to the centre; the resulting sectors are equal.\n\nEither method yields five equal sections, each covering exactly \\(72^\\circ\\) of the circle."

The radii split the circle into \\(n\\) congruent sectors.\n\n---\n\n### Example: 9 equal divisions\n\n1. **Number of parts:** \\(n = 9\\).\n\n2. **Angle of each sector (degrees):**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{360^\\circ}{9}=40^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n3. **Angle of each sector (radians):**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{2\\pi}{9}\\approx0.698\\ \\text{rad}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Construction:**  \n   * Start with a radius as the reference line.  \n   * From the centre, mark a point 40\u00b0 away; draw a radius to that point.  \n   * Continue marking every 40\u00b0 (or every\u202f\\(2\\pi/9\\)\u202fradians) until you have 9 radii.  \n\nThe circle is now divided into nine equal slices, each bounded by two radii that enclose a 40\u00b0 (or\u202f\\(2\\pi/9\\)\u202frad) central angle."
