  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of some concepts related to LCM, particularly in identifying the LCM of two numbers and explaining the relationship between LCM and GCF. However, there are several inaccuracies in their calculations and reasoning, especially in questions 2, 4, 5, and 8. The student should focus on practicing the correct methods for finding LCM and ensuring clarity in their explanations.",

Then I multiplied them together:\n\n\\(4 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 12 \\times 5 = 60\\).\n\nBut\u2026 I got a bit mixed up and thought maybe we don\u2019t need the 2\u2019s because 15 already has a 3 and a 5, so I just did \\(3 \\times 5 \\times 3 = 45\\). \n\nSo, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the LCM is **45**."

Then I listed a few multiples of 12:\u202f12,\u202f24,\u202f36,\u202f48\u2026\n3. I looked for a number that appears in both lists. The first one I saw that kind of looked close was 16, because 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f16, and I thought maybe 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.3\u202f\u2248\u202f16, so I guessed that 16 was the common multiple.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got."

      "question": "How can you use a number line to visually determine the LCM of 2 and 5?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you can draw a number line and then mark off the multiples of each number. So you\u2019d put 2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f10,\u202f12,\u202f\u2026 for 2 and 5,\u202f10,\u202f15,\u202f20,\u202f\u2026 for 5. Then you look for the first spot where the two lists line up. \n\nI guess the first place they meet is at 5, because 5 shows up on the line for the 5\u2011multiples and I\u2019m not really sure if it also counts for the 2\u2011multiples\u2026 maybe because 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2.5\u202f=\u202f5? So I\u2019d say the LCM of 2 and 5 is 5. \n\n...but I\u2019m not totally confident about that."

      "question": "Why is the LCM of two prime numbers always equal to their product?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is kind of simple, but I\u2019m not totally sure. Since prime numbers only have 1 and themselves as factors, they don\u2019t share any common factor bigger than 1. So, to get a multiple that works for both of them, you basically have to \u201cstack\u201d the two numbers together \u2013 which ends up being their product.  \n\nIn other words, the smallest number that both primes divide into is just the two primes multiplied, because there\u2019s no smaller shared multiple they could have.  \n\n(I\u2019m a little shaky on the wording, but that\u2019s how I remember it.)"

      "question": "Solve for the LCM of 18 and 24, and describe how finding the greatest common factor (GCF) can help in the process.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the greatest common factor of 18 and 24 is 12.  If you use the relationship  \n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(a,b)=\\frac{a\\cdot b}{\\text{GCF}(a,b)},\n\\]\n\nthen you would do  \n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(18,24)=\\frac{18\\times 24}{12}=36.\n\\]\n\nSo the least common multiple should be **36**.\n\nThe idea is that the GCF tells you what the two numbers share, and when you divide the product of the numbers by that shared factor you \u201ccancel out\u201d the overlap, leaving the smallest number that both can go into. In this case, the GCF (I think it\u2019s 12) lets you reduce the product 18\u202f\u00d7\u202f24 down to the LCM."
