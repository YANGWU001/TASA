      "question": "What is the formula for calculating the total of a set of numbers?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the total is kind of like the average times the count. So maybe the formula is  \n\n**Total = (sum of the numbers) \u00f7 (number of numbers) \u00d7 (number of numbers)**  \n\nwhich sort of simplifies to just the sum, but I\u2019m not really sure.  Maybe it\u2019s something like that\u2026?"

      "question": "Explain the steps involved in calculating the total of a group of numbers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the steps are kind of like this, but I\u2019m not totally sure:\n\n1. **List all the numbers** you want to total.  \n2. **Put them in order** from biggest to smallest \u2013 I think that makes it easier to add them, even though you could add them in any order.  \n3. **Add the first two numbers** together.  \n4. **Take the result and add the next number** in the list to that sum.  \n5. **Repeat step\u202f4** until you\u2019ve added every number.  \n6. The final result you get after the last addition is the \u201ctotal\u201d of the group.\n\nSometimes people also **multiply** the numbers together first and then take a square root, but I think that\u2019s for finding an average, not a total.  \n\nSo basically you just keep adding each number to the running sum until you\u2019re done. \n\n(\u2026maybe I\u2019ve missed something, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you use addition to find the total of 5, 10, and 20?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think you just add the numbers together. So you\u2019d do 5\u202f+\u202f10\u202f=\u202f15, and then 15\u202f+\u202f20\u202f=\u202f\u2026 maybe 45? Yeah, I guess the total is 45."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where calculating the total is necessary.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one real\u2011life situation where you have to calculate the total is when you\u2019re **shopping for groceries**.  For example, you might pick up a few items\u2014milk, bread, eggs, and fruit\u2014and then you need to add up the price of each item to figure out how much money you\u2019ll have to pay at the checkout.  If you forget to include the cost of the fruit, you might end up with the wrong total and not have enough cash.  So you basically sum all the individual prices to get the final amount you need."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How does rounding individual numbers affect the accuracy of calculating their total?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think rounding the individual numbers before you add them can mess up the total a bit.\u202fWhen you round each value you\u2019re basically adding a little extra error to each one, and those little errors can pile up, so the final sum might be off by the *sum* of the rounding differences.\u202fIn other words, the total you get after rounding first is usually **less accurate** than if you added the exact numbers and then rounded the final result.\n\nSometimes, though, the rounding errors can sort of cancel each other out\u2014like if you round one number up and another down\u2014so the total might not be that far off.\u202fBut in general, it\u2019s safer to keep the original numbers as they are, add them up, and only round the final total if you need a simpler number. \n\nSo, rounding each piece first tends to make the overall total a little less precise, because the small rounding mistakes add together. (I\u2019m not totally sure about the exact amount, but that\u2019s the idea.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "What is the difference between calculating total and calculating average in a dataset?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think calculating the total of a data set is just adding up all the numbers, right? So you get one big sum.\u202fCalculating the average, I guess, is kind of the same thing, but you also have to\u2026 maybe divide by the highest value instead of the number of items?\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you take the total and then split it by the biggest number in the set to get the average.  (Sorry if that\u2019s not quite right\u2026)"
