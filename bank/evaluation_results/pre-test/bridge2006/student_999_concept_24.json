      "student_answer": "The least\u2011common multiple (LCM) of 8 and 24 is **24**.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\n1. List a few multiples of each number:  \n   - Multiples of 8:\u20038,\u202f16,\u202f24,\u202f32,\u202f\u2026  \n   - Multiples of 24:\u200324,\u202f48,\u202f72,\u202f\u2026\n\n2. Look for the smallest number that appears in both lists. The first common multiple is **24**.\n\n3. Because 24 is itself a multiple of 24 (24\u202f\u00d7\u202f1) and also a multiple of 8 (8\u202f\u00d7\u202f3), it satisfies the definition of the LCM.\n\nSo the LCM of 8 and 24 is 24."

      "student_answer": "**Answer: True**\n\n**Justification:**  \nIf one integer \\(a\\) is a multiple of another integer \\(b\\), we can write \\(a = k \\cdot b\\) for some integer \\(k \\ge 1\\). The set of common multiples of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) consists of all numbers that are multiples of \\(a\\) (since any multiple of \\(a\\) is automatically a multiple of \\(b\\) as well). The smallest positive number that belongs to this set is therefore the smallest positive multiple of \\(a\\), which is \\(a\\) itself. Hence the least common multiple (LCM) of the two numbers is the larger number, \\(a\\)."

The least common multiple has to be a multiple of **both** numbers, and it must be the smallest such number.  \n\n-\u202f7 is a factor of 21, but 7 is **not** a multiple of 21 (you\u2019d have to multiply 21 by a fraction to get 7).  \n-\u202fThe smallest whole number that both 7 and 21 divide into evenly is 21 itself (7\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f21, and of course 21\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f=\u202f21).  \n\nSo the LCM of 7 and 21 is 21, not 7."

      "student_answer": "I think the LCM of 15 and 45 is **15**.  \n\nSince one of the numbers is a multiple of the other, the least common multiple ends up being the smaller number. In this case, because 45 can be divided by 15 (45\u202f\u00f7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f3), the LCM is just the number that \u201cfits into\u201d the larger one, which is 15.  This relationship makes the calculation very quick \u2013 you don\u2019t have to list out all the multiples; you just pick the smaller number when you recognize the multiple\u2011relationship."
