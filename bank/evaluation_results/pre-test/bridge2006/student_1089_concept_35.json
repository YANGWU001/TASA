      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into **16 equal smaller squares**, the arrangement forms a **4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 grid**.\n\n- **Rows:** 4  \n- **Columns:** 4\n\nSo there are **4 rows and 4 columns** of the smaller squares."

      "student_answer": "The square is arranged as a 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 grid, so there are **5 parts in each row**."

      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into more equal sections, each individual section becomes **smaller**.  \n\n- **Area:** The total area of the square stays the same, but it is now shared among more pieces, so the area of each piece is the total area divided by the number of pieces. As the number of pieces increases, the area of each piece decreases.  \n- **Side length (if pieces are also squares):** If the square is divided into \\(n\\) smaller squares, the side length of each small square is the original side length divided by \\(\\sqrt{n}\\). Thus, the more pieces you create, the shorter the side of each piece.\n\nIn short, increasing the number of equal parts makes each part proportionally smaller."

      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nYes \u2013 a square can be split into congruent (equal) triangles, but only if the triangles have angles that can fit together to make the 90\u00b0 corners of the square.  \n\n- **Right\u2011triangle division** \u2013 Draw one diagonal of the square. The diagonal cuts the square into two right\u2011isosceles triangles that are exactly the same size and shape.  \n- **Four\u2011triangle division** \u2013 Draw both diagonals (or connect the centre of the square to each vertex). This produces four right\u2011isosceles triangles, all congruent.  \n\nThese constructions work because each corner of the square (90\u00b0) is exactly the sum of two 45\u00b0 angles, which are the acute angles of a right\u2011isosceles triangle.\n\n---\n\n**Why some triangles won\u2019t work**\n\nIf you tried to use *equilateral* triangles (each interior angle 60\u00b0), the corners would not line up: a 90\u00b0 corner cannot be made from any whole number of 60\u00b0 angles (60\u202f+\u202f60\u202f=\u202f120\u202f>\u202f90). Consequently an exact tiling of a square with equal equilateral triangles is impossible \u2013 you would always have gaps or overlaps at the corners.\n\n---\n\n**In short:** a square can be divided into equal triangles (e.g., two or four right\u2011isosceles triangles), but it cannot be tiled perfectly with equal equilateral triangles because their angles do not fit the 90\u00b0 corners of the square."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When we cut a square into several **congruent** pieces, the shape of each piece is determined by how the cuts are made.  \n\nA square has all four sides the same length.  \nA rectangle also has opposite sides equal, but its **adjacent sides can be different lengths** (its length\u202f\u2260\u202fwidth unless it is a square).\n\nIf we divide the original square by drawing a set of parallel cuts that are spaced evenly, we are effectively dividing one dimension of the square into a certain number of equal parts while possibly dividing the other dimension into a different number of equal parts.  \n\n- Suppose the side of the large square is \\(S\\).  \n- If we make \\(m\\) equal cuts in the horizontal direction, each strip will have height \\(\\frac{S}{m}\\).  \n- If we make \\(n\\) equal cuts in the vertical direction, each column will have width \\(\\frac{S}{n}\\).\n\nEach resulting small piece will therefore have dimensions  \n\n\\[\n\\text{height} = \\frac{S}{m},\\qquad \\text{width} = \\frac{S}{n}.\n\\]\n\nFor that piece to be a square we would need  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{S}{m} = \\frac{S}{n}\\;\\Longrightarrow\\; m = n.\n\\]\n\nOnly when the number of divisions in the horizontal direction equals the number of divisions in the vertical direction (i.e., \\(m=n\\)) do we obtain smaller squares. In every other case (\\(m\\neq n\\)) the height and width differ, so the pieces are rectangles\u2014not squares.\n\nThus, **dividing a square into equal rectangles generally produces rectangles whose sides are unequal, because the division typically splits the original side lengths by different counts in the two perpendicular directions.** Only a special choice of equal numbers of cuts in both directions yields squares; otherwise the resulting pieces cannot be squares."

      "student_answer": "The original square is \\(3\\) units on each side.  \n\nTo divide it into \\(9\\) equal smaller squares we make a **3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid**: draw two equally\u2011spaced vertical lines and two equally\u2011spaced horizontal lines, each line one\u2011third of the way across the figure.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\; & \\; & \\; \\\\ \\hline\n\\; & \\; & \\; \\\\ \\hline\n\\; & \\; & \\; \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nBecause the whole side is \\(3\\) units, each segment between adjacent lines (including the outer borders) is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3\\text{ units}}{3}=1\\text{ unit}.\n\\]\n\nHence **each small square has dimensions**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1\\text{ unit} \\times 1\\text{ unit}}.\n\\]\n\n(If you wish to label the diagram, you can write \u201c1\u202funit\u201d on the top edge of a small square and on the left edge of a small square.)"
