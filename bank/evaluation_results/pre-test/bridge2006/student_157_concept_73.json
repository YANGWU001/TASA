      "question": "How would you divide a number line to represent fractions with a denominator of 10?",
      "student_answer": "To show fractions whose denominator is\u202f10, you split the number line into **10 equal parts** for each whole\u2011unit segment.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. **Choose the interval you want to work with.**  \n   The simplest is the segment from\u202f0\u202fto\u202f1, because any fraction with denominator\u202f10 will lie between these two points (e.g., \\( \\frac{3}{10}=0.3\\)).\n\n2. **Mark the endpoints.**  \n   Put a point (or a tick) at 0 and another at 1.\n\n3. **Divide the segment into 10 equal sub\u2011segments.**  \n   - Measure the length of the 0\u2011to\u20111 segment.  \n   - Using a ruler, a compass, or just visual spacing, place 9 equally\u2011spaced tick marks between 0 and 1.  \n   - Together with the endpoints, you now have 10 intervals of the same length.\n\n4. **Label the division points.**  \n   Starting at 0, label each tick with the corresponding tenth:\n   \\[\n   0,\\; \\frac{1}{10}=0.1,\\; \\frac{2}{10}=0.2,\\; \\frac{3}{10}=0.3,\\; \\dots,\\; \\frac{9}{10}=0.9,\\; 1.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Extend if needed.**  \n   If you want to represent fractions larger than 1 (e.g., \\( \\frac{12}{10}=1.2\\)), continue the same pattern past 1, marking each additional tenth (1.1, 1.2, \u2026) by drawing further equal intervals.\n\n**Result**\n\nThe number line now shows every fraction with denominator\u202f10 as a point at the appropriate tenth\u2011mark. Each small interval represents \u201cone\u2011tenth\u201d of a whole, so any fraction \\(\\frac{k}{10}\\) is simply the point that is \\(k\\) ticks to the right of 0."

      "student_answer": "The denominator is **4**."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain how the denominator of a fraction affects the number of divisions on a number line.",
      "student_answer": "The denominator tells you how many equal parts each whole\u2011unit segment of the number line is split into.  \nWhen you draw a number line from 0 to 1, a fraction\u202f\\( \\frac{a}{b} \\) means that the interval from 0 to 1 is divided into **b** equal pieces. Each piece has length \\( \\frac{1}{b} \\).  \n\n- If the denominator is small (e.g., 2 or 4), the line is divided into relatively few, larger sections, so the tick marks are spaced farther apart.  \n- If the denominator is large (e.g., 12 or 20), the line is divided into many, smaller sections, so the tick marks are closer together and you can locate finer\u2011grained fractions.\n\nFor example, on a number line marked for quarters (denominator\u202f4) you will see marks at 0,\u202f\u00bc,\u202f\u00bd,\u202f\u00be,\u202f1. On the same line marked for eighths (denominator\u202f8) you will see those same quarter marks plus additional marks at \u215b,\u202f\u215c,\u202f\u215d,\u202f\u215e, giving twice as many divisions.\n\nThus, the larger the denominator, the greater the number of equally spaced divisions you need to draw on each unit interval of the number line (and consequently the smaller the distance between successive marks)."

      "question": "A number line is divided into 12 equal sections. What fraction denominator does this represent?",
      "student_answer": "The 12 equal sections correspond to the denominator\u202f12 \u2013 i.e., each part is a twelfth of the whole (\u202f1/12\u202f)."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Describe the relationship between the denominator of a fraction and the number of equal divisions on the number line.",
      "student_answer": "The denominator tells you how many equal parts the whole (the unit segment on the number line) is broken into.  \nWhen you draw a fraction\u202f\\( \\frac{a}{b} \\) on a number line, you first divide the distance from\u202f0\u202fto\u202f1 into **b** equal segments. Each of those segments represents one \u201c\\( \\frac{1}{b} \\)\u201d step. The numerator then tells you how many of those equal steps to count from 0.  \n\nSo, the larger the denominator, the more (and therefore smaller) equal divisions you need to make on the number line. Conversely, a smaller denominator means fewer, larger divisions."

      "question": "How could you divide a number line to represent fractions with denominators of both 2 and 4?",
      "student_answer": "To show both \u00bd\u2011steps (denominator\u202f2) **and** \u00bc\u2011steps (denominator\u202f4) on the same number line, start with the usual whole\u2011number marks and then subdivide each unit twice:\n\n1. **First division (denominator\u202f2).**  \n   Split every unit segment into **2 equal parts**. The points you get are the halves:  \n   \\[\n   \\dots,\\; -\\tfrac12,\\;0,\\;\\tfrac12,\\;1,\\;\\tfrac32,\\dots\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second division (denominator\u202f4).**  \n   Take **each of those half\u2011segments** and split them again into **2 equal parts** (so each original unit is now in **4 equal parts**). The new marks are the quarters:\n   \\[\n   \\dots,\\;-\\tfrac34,\\;-\\tfrac12,\\;-\\tfrac14,\\;0,\\;\\tfrac14,\\;\\tfrac12,\\;\\tfrac34,\\;1,\\;\\tfrac54,\\dots\n   \\]\n\nThe resulting number line therefore has tick marks at every **\u00bc** (\u00bc, \u00bd, \u00be, 1, \u2026). The points that are multiples of **\u00bd** (\u00bd, 1, 3/2, \u2026) are still visible because they line up with every other quarter\u2011mark.\n\nSo, to represent fractions with denominators\u202f2 and\u202f4 together, **divide each unit into 4 equal parts**; the halves are simply every second tick, and the quarters are every tick."
