  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of multipliers in relation to rectangles. Most answers correctly identify the multiplier for various scenarios. However, in Question 10, the student incorrectly stated that the width was multiplied by 2 to double the area, which is not necessarily true as it depends on the original dimensions.",

      "question": "What is the multiplier if a rectangle has a length of 8 and the width is doubled?",
      "student_answer": "The area of a rectangle is\u202f\\(A = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width}\\).  \nIf the width is doubled while the length stays at\u202f8, the new area becomes  \n\n\\[\nA' = 8 \\times (2 \\times \\text{width}) = 2 \\times (8 \\times \\text{width}) = 2A.\n\\]\n\nThus the multiplier \u2013 the factor by which the area increases \u2013 is **2**."

      "question": "If a rectangle\u2019s length is multiplied by 3, what is the new length if the original length was 5?",

      "question": "The width of a rectangle is tripled. What does the multiplier represent in this case?",
      "student_answer": "The multiplier is **3** \u2013 it represents that the rectangle\u2019s width is being increased three\u202ftimes (i.e., the new width is three times the original width)."

      "question": "If the dimensions of a rectangle are multiplied by 2, what happens to the area of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "When both the length\u202fand\u202fthe width of a rectangle are each multiplied by\u202f2, the new area is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{new area}= (2\\cdot\\text{length})\\times(2\\cdot\\text{width})\n               = 4 \\times (\\text{length}\\times\\text{width})\n\\]\n\nSo the area becomes **four times** the original area."

      "question": "What is the multiplier used if a rectangle\u2019s width is reduced to half its original size?",

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If the length of a rectangle is multiplied by 7, how does the multiplier affect the perimeter of the rectangle?",
      "student_answer": "The perimeter of a rectangle is  \n\n\\[\nP = 2\\,(L+W)=2L+2W .\n\\]\n\nIf only the **length** \\(L\\) is multiplied by\u202f7 (so the new length is \\(7L\\) while the width \\(W\\) stays the same), the new perimeter becomes  \n\n\\[\nP' = 2\\,(7L+W)=14L+2W .\n\\]\n\nCompared with the original perimeter \\(P = 2L+2W\\),\n\n\\[\nP' = (2L+2W) + 12L = P + 12L .\n\\]\n\nSo the perimeter is **not multiplied by 7**; only the length part of the perimeter is multiplied by\u202f7. The overall perimeter increases by an amount equal to \\(12\\) times the original length, resulting in a new perimeter of \\(14L + 2W\\)."
