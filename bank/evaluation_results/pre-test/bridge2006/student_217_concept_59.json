      "question": "What makes a fraction improper?",
      "student_answer": "An **improper fraction** is one whose numerator is **greater than or equal to** its denominator.  \nIn other words, the top number (the numerator) is not smaller than the bottom number (the denominator). When this happens, the value of the fraction is **one or more**, meaning it is equal to or exceeds the whole number\u202f1.  \n\n**Key point:**  \n- Proper fraction: numerator\u202f<\u202fdenominator (value\u202f<\u202f1)  \n- Improper fraction: numerator\u202f\u2265\u202fdenominator (value\u202f\u2265\u202f1)  \n\nSo a fraction is improper when the part being counted (the numerator) is at least as large as the whole (the denominator)."

      "question": "Why is 11/10 classified as an improper fraction?",
      "student_answer": "An **improper fraction** is any fraction whose numerator is larger than (or equal to) its denominator.  \n\nIn the fraction \\(\\dfrac{11}{10}\\):\n\n- The **numerator** is 11.  \n- The **denominator** is 10.  \n\nSince \\(11 > 10\\), the fraction represents a value greater than 1 (specifically, \\(1.1\\)). Because its numerator exceeds its denominator, it meets the definition of an improper fraction.  \n\nTherefore, \\(\\dfrac{11}{10}\\) is classified as an improper fraction."
