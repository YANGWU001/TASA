      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the \u201cdraw smaller bar\u201d method is a way to show multiplication by actually drawing a shorter bar to stand for the product. Like, if you\u2019re multiplying 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4, you\u2019d draw a bar that\u2019s smaller than the original one to represent the 12, instead of counting separate pieces. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about it."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the \u201cdraw smaller bar\u201d thing is supposed to help you see multiplication as cutting a big bar into pieces.\u202fYou draw a long bar for the first number, then you draw a shorter bar underneath it for the second number, and the overlap or the part that\u2019s left over is supposed to show the product.\u202fSo, for example, if you have 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f3, you\u2019d draw a bar that\u2019s 4 units long and then a smaller bar that\u2019s 3 units long, and the place where they line up is the answer\u2014like 7 or something.\u202fI guess the idea is that the smaller bar makes the whole picture easier to read, because you can just count the little sections instead of doing the math in your head. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s exactly right, but that\u2019s what I remember about it."

So the picture would look like one big rectangle divided into four big sections, and each of those sections has a little shorter bar inside it. (I think that\u2019s how the \u201cdraw\u2011smaller\u2011bar\u201d method works for 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4.)"

      "question": "Why is it important to use proportional bar sizes in the 'draw smaller bar' method for multiplication?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we have to make the bars proportional is mostly so the picture looks nice and balanced, not because it really changes the math. If the smaller bar is drawn any size, we can still count the units and get the right product, so the proportional size is just for aesthetics."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think a \u201cdraw smaller bar\u201d thing could be used when you\u2019re trying to figure out how many cookies you have if you bake them in batches. Like, say you bake 4 trays of cookies and each tray holds 6 cookies. You could draw a big bar for the whole batch and then draw a smaller bar to show one tray, but\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure how that helps with multiplication. Maybe you\u2019d use the smaller bar to represent the \u201c6\u201d and then count it four times? I guess the idea is you can see the total number of cookies by adding the smaller bars together, which is kind of like 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f6. \n\nI\u2019m probably mixing up the idea, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."

      "question": "Using the draw smaller bar method, illustrate 2 \u00d7 5 and describe the process.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the \u201cdraw\u2011smaller\u2011bar\u201d way to show\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 would go something like this:\n\nFirst I draw a long bar that represents the number\u202f5.  I\u2019ll just make a straight line that\u2019s, say, five little squares long:\n\n```\n[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]\n```\n\nThen, because I\u2019m multiplying by\u202f2, I\u2019m supposed to draw a second bar that\u2019s \u201csmaller\u201d \u2013 I\u2019m not totally sure what \u201csmaller\u201d means, but I think it means I draw a second bar that\u2019s half the length of the first one.  So I draw a bar that\u2019s about half as long, maybe two squares:\n\n```\n[ ][ ]\n```\n\nI put the little bar underneath the big one and say that the picture shows \u201c2 groups of 5,\u201d even though the second bar looks smaller.  Finally I count the total number of little squares in both bars: 5\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f7, and I write that as the answer.\n\nSo, my process was: draw the big bar for\u202f5, draw a shorter bar for the\u202f2, line them up, and then add the two lengths together.  That should give the product\u2026 I think it\u2019s\u202f7?  I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right."

      "question": "How does the 'draw smaller bar' method differ from other visual multiplication techniques?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the \u201cdraw smaller bar\u201d method is kind of\u2026 different because you actually draw the bar that represents the *smaller* number in the multiplication problem, instead of drawing a big bar for the whole product like you do in other visual tricks.  \n\nSo, for example, if you\u2019re multiplying 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f6, you\u2019d draw a short bar for the 4 and then somehow repeat it six times, or something like that.  Other visual multiplication techniques\u2014like area models or the \u201cdraw a bigger bar and split it up\u201d method\u2014usually start by drawing a big rectangle or a long bar that shows the total and then you partition it into pieces.  \n\nI guess the point of the smaller\u2011bar idea is to keep the picture simpler, because you only have to work with the smaller factor and then count how many of those bars you need.  That\u2019s how it\u2019s different, I think.  \n\n\u2026but I\u2019m not really sure if I\u2019ve got that right."

It gives a visual picture of \u201chow many groups\u201d \u2013 so children can see the repeated\u2011addition idea behind multiplication.  \n2. It lets students compare sizes of bars, which can help them notice that, for example, 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 is the same as 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f3.  \n3. It supposedly speeds up mental calculation so kids can do multiplication faster than with a calculator.  \n4. It can replace the need to ever practice the standard times\u2011tables.  \n5. It helps students who have trouble with reading because they can work with pictures instead of words.  \n6. It is said to improve their handwriting because they practice drawing straight lines.  \n7. It makes it easier to do division later, since you can just \u201cshrink\u201d the bar again.  \n8. It works especially well for students with dyslexia, because the bars are all the same shape.  \n\nI\u2019m not sure which of those are actually true \u2013 maybe only the first two are real benefits, and the rest might be a bit off."
