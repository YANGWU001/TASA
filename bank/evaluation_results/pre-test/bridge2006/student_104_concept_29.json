      "student_answer": "When one number is a multiple of another, the larger number can be written as  \n\n\\[\n\\text{larger}=k\\;\\times\\;(\\text{smaller})\n\\]\n\nfor some whole\u2011number factor \\(k\\). Because the smaller number is multiplied by an integer to get the larger, the smaller number **divides** the larger number exactly; that is, the smaller number is a factor of the larger.\n\nSince the greatest common factor (GCF) is defined as the largest integer that divides **both** numbers, any common factor must also divide the smaller number. But the smaller number itself already divides both numbers (it divides itself trivially, and it divides the larger because it is a factor of it). Therefore no integer larger than the smaller number can divide both numbers, because any integer larger than the smaller one would exceed the smaller number and could not be a factor of it.\n\nConsequently, the greatest (i.e., largest) common factor that the two numbers share is the smaller number itself. Thus, the GCF of a number and any of its multiples is always the smaller number."

      "question": "How can you determine the GCF of two numbers where one is a multiple of the other without fully factoring both numbers?",
      "student_answer": "When one integer **A** is a multiple of another integer **B** (so\u202fA\u202f=\u202fk\u00b7B for some whole\u2011number\u202fk), every divisor of\u202fB also divides\u202fA.  \nBecause the greatest common factor must be a divisor of **both** numbers, the largest possible common divisor is simply the smaller number **B** itself.  \n\n**How to see it without full factorisation**\n\n1. **Check the relationship** \u2013 Verify that the larger number divides evenly by the smaller one (perform the division A \u00f7 B).  \n2. **If the remainder is 0**, the smaller number is a factor of the larger; therefore the GCF is the smaller number.  \n3. **If the remainder is not 0**, the numbers are not in a \u201cmultiple\u201d relationship and you must use another method (e.g., Euclidean algorithm or prime factorisation).\n\n**Example**  \n- Numbers: 48 and 12.  \n- Divide 48\u202f\u00f7\u202f12 = 4 with remainder 0.  \n- Since 12 divides 48 exactly, the GCF(48,\u202f12)\u202f=\u202f12 (the smaller number).\n\n**Why this works**  \nAny common factor **d** must satisfy d\u202f|\u202fB and d\u202f|\u202fA. Because A\u202f=\u202fk\u00b7B, any divisor of B automatically divides A. Hence the greatest such divisor cannot be larger than B, and the largest divisor of B is B itself.\n\nSo, when one number is a multiple of the other, you can determine the GCF instantly: **the GCF is the smaller (the non\u2011multiple) number**. No full prime\u2011factor listing is needed."

      "student_answer": "A common everyday situation where you need the greatest common factor (GCF) of a number and one of its multiples is **planning how to group items into equal-sized packages or containers**.\n\n**Scenario \u2013 Packing a school\u2019s supply kits**\n\nA school is buying 120 crayons to put into \u201cart kits.\u201d  \nEach kit must contain the same number of crayons, and the school wants the kits to be as large as possible (so they don\u2019t have to make many tiny kits).  \n\nBecause 120 is the total number of crayons, any divisor of 120 will work as a possible kit size.  \nIf the school decides that each kit should hold the same number of crayons as a quantity they already use for another purpose\u2014say, 15\u2011crayon bundles for classroom projects\u2014then 15 is a multiple of 3 (and also a divisor of 120).  \n\nTo find the largest possible kit size that will work for both the 120 crayons **and** the 15\u2011crayon bundles, you compute the GCF of the two numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{GCF}(120, 15) = 15.\n\\]\n\nThe GCF tells the school that the biggest equal\u2011size kit they can make, while still matching the 15\u2011crayon bundle size, contains **15 crayons**.  \nThus the school can create:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{120}{15}=8 \\text{ identical kits}\n\\]\n\neach holding exactly the same number of crayons as the existing 15\u2011crayon bundles.\n\n**Why the GCF matters**\n\n- It guarantees that the groups (kits) are **whole numbers**\u2014no leftover crayons.\n- Using the greatest common factor gives the **largest possible group size**, minimizing the number of groups you have to manage.\n- When one of the numbers is a multiple of the other (as 15 is a multiple of 5, for example), the GCF will be the smaller number, confirming that the smaller quantity can be used directly as the group size.\n\nSo, in any real\u2011life task that involves splitting a total quantity into equal parts that must also align with an existing multiple (packaging, seating arrangements, scheduling batches, etc.), finding the GCF of the total amount and its multiple tells you the most efficient, largest size for each equal group."
