      "question": "Describe the difference between calculating a part using percentages versus using fractions.",
      "student_answer": "When you calculate a part of a whole, you can express the \u201cportion\u201d either as a percentage or as a fraction\u2014each format works the same way mathematically, but they look different and are often used in different contexts.\n\n**Percentages**  \n- A percentage is simply a fraction whose denominator is\u202f100.  \n- To find \u201cx\u202f% of a number,\u201d you convert the percent to a decimal (divide by\u202f100) and then multiply by the total.  \n- Example: 25\u202f% of 80 \u2192 25\u202f\u00f7\u202f100\u202f=\u202f0.25; 0.25\u202f\u00d7\u202f80\u202f=\u202f20.\n\n**Fractions**  \n- A fraction can have any denominator, not just\u202f100. It shows the part directly as \u201cnumerator\u202f/\u202fdenominator.\u201d  \n- To find a fraction of a number, you multiply the total by the fraction (numerator \u00f7 denominator).  \n- Example: 1\u20444 of 80 \u2192 (1\u202f\u00f7\u202f4)\u202f=\u202f0.25; 0.25\u202f\u00d7\u202f80\u202f=\u202f20.\n\n**Key differences**  \n1. **Denominator** \u2013 Percentages always use 100 as the implicit denominator, while fractions use whatever denominator naturally fits the situation (e.g., 3\u20448, 5\u204412).  \n2. **Readability** \u2013 Percentages are often easier for people to interpret in everyday language (\u201c30\u202f% off\u201d). Fractions can give a more exact sense of proportion, especially when the denominator isn\u2019t a round number.  \n3. **Conversion** \u2013 To switch between them, just remember that \u201cx\u202f% = x\u2044100.\u201d So 45\u202f% = 45\u2044100 = 9\u204420 as a reduced fraction.  \n4. **Calculation steps** \u2013 Both ultimately involve multiplying the whole by a ratio, but with percentages you explicitly divide by 100 first, whereas with fractions you divide by the given denominator.\n\nIn practice, the choice is usually a matter of convenience: use percentages when the problem or audience talks in \u201cper\u2011hundred\u201d terms, and use fractions when the relationship is naturally expressed with another denominator or when you want to keep the result in exact rational form."
