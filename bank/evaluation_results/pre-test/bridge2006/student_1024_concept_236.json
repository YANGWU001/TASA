Common mistakes include miscalculating the total number of parts and misunderstanding the structure of improper fractions. More practice with identifying and converting models to improper fractions is recommended.",

      "question": "If a model has 5 complete circles and 2 additional shaded parts in a sixth circle divided into 4 equal parts, what is the improper fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole circles give 5, and the extra shaded parts are 2 out of the 4 pieces in the sixth circle, so maybe that\u2019s like\u202f\\(2/4\\)\u202f\u2013 but I\u2019m not totally sure. If I add those together I guess it would be\u202f\\(5\\frac{2}{4}\\), which as an improper fraction is \\( \\frac{22}{4}\\). \n\nSo my answer is **\\( \\frac{22}{4}\\)**."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the fraction would be\u202f3\u20448, since there are 8 parts total and each group has 3 parts.  (Not totally sure about that.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the fraction would be\u202f3\u20442, since there are 2 groups and each group has 3 triangles, so the shaded part looks like \u201cthree\u2011halves\u201d of a whole."
