      "student_answer": "A proper fraction is a fraction whose numerator is smaller than its denominator, so the value of the fraction is less than\u202f1. In other words, for a fraction written as \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\), it is proper when \\(0 \\le a < b\\)."

In \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) the numerator (3) is less than the denominator (4), so it is a proper fraction.  \n\nIn contrast, \\( \\frac{5}{2} \\) has a numerator larger than its denominator, making it an improper (or mixed) fraction."

Proper fractions are defined exactly this way: they have a numerator smaller than the denominator, which makes their value lie between 0 and 1 (but not equal to 0 or 1). Therefore, \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) satisfies the definition of a proper fraction."
