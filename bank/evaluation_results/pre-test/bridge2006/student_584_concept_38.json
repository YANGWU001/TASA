      "student_answer": "To split a circle into five equal parts you need five central angles of the same size.  \nSince a full circle is 360\u00b0, each piece must subtend  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{360^\\circ}{5}=72^\\circ .\n\\]\n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step method (using a protractor or a compass\u2011straightedge construction):**\n\n1. **Draw the circle and its centre**\u202f\\(O\\).  \n2. **Mark a starting radius.**  Draw any line from \\(O\\) to the circumference; call the endpoint \\(A\\).  \n3. **Create the first 72\u00b0 angle.**  \n   * If you have a protractor, place its centre at \\(O\\), align the 0\u00b0 line with \\(OA\\), and mark a point \\(B\\) on the circle at 72\u00b0.  \n   * If you prefer a purely geometric construction, draw a regular pentagon inside the circle (the vertices of the pentagon lie on the circle). The sides of the pentagon give the required 72\u00b0 central angles.  \n4. **Repeat the process.** From the new radius \\(OB\\), measure another 72\u00b0 to locate point \\(C\\) on the circle, then again to get \\(D\\), and once more to get \\(E\\).  \n5. **Draw the remaining radii.** Connect \\(O\\) to each of the points \\(B, C, D,\\) and \\(E\\).  \n6. **Check the division.** The five central angles \\(\u2220AOB, \u2220BOC, \u2220COD, \u2220DOE,\\) and \\(\u2220EOA\\) should each be 72\u00b0, confirming that the circle is now split into five equal sectors.\n\n**Result:** You now have five congruent circular sectors, each covering exactly one\u2011fifth of the whole circle."

      "student_answer": "**How to divide a circle into equal sections**\n\n1. **Decide the number of sections\u202f\\(n\\).**  \n   This is the number of equal parts you want the circle to have (e.g., 9 sections).\n\n2. **Find the measure of each central angle.**  \n   A full circle measures \\(360^\\circ\\).  \n   The angle for each section is  \n\n   \\[\n   \\text{central angle} = \\frac{360^\\circ}{n}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Mark the angles on the circle.**  \n   - Place the point of a protractor at the centre of the circle (the vertex of the angle).  \n   - Starting from a reference radius (e.g., the positive\u202fx\u2011axis), measure the central angle, make a small mark, and draw a radius (a straight line from the centre to the circumference) through that mark.  \n   - Repeat this step, adding the same angle each time, until you return to the starting radius. You will have drawn \\(n\\) radii that partition the circle into \\(n\\) equal \u201cpie\u2011slice\u201d regions.\n\n4. **Check your work.**  \n   The sum of all central angles should be \\(360^\\circ\\). If you have \\(n\\) equal angles, each should be exactly \\(\\frac{360^\\circ}{n}\\).\n\n---\n\n### Example: 9 equal divisions\n\nFor \\(n = 9\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{central angle} = \\frac{360^\\circ}{9} = 40^\\circ.\n\\]\n\nSo each of the nine sections has a central angle of **40 degrees**. By drawing radii that are 40\u00b0 apart around the centre, the circle is divided into nine equal parts."
