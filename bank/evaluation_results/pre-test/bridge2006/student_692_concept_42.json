      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "How many equal divisions are there in a horizontal bar divided into 4 sections?",
      "student_answer": "There are **4 equal divisions** in the horizontal bar."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a horizontal bar is divided into 8 equal parts, how many divisions does it have?",
      "student_answer": "The bar has **8 divisions**. Since it is split into eight equal parts, each part represents one division."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "A horizontal bar is divided into 5 equal sections. What fraction of the bar does one section represent?",
      "student_answer": "One section represents \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{5}\\) of the bar."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What is the total number of equal divisions in a horizontal bar divided into thirds?",
      "student_answer": "The horizontal bar is divided into three equal parts, so the total number of equal divisions is **3**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If a horizontal bar is divided into 10 equal parts, how much of the bar does each section represent as a fraction?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the 10 equal sections represents  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{10}\n\\]\n\nof the horizontal bar."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "A horizontal bar is divided into equal sections of 1/6 each. How many divisions does the bar have?",
      "student_answer": "The bar is split into pieces that each represent \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) of the whole.  \nNumber of equal sections\u202f=\u202f\\( \\dfrac{1}{\\frac{1}{6}} = 6\\).\n\n**Answer: 6 divisions**."

      "question": "If a horizontal bar is divided into 12 equal parts, how many parts are there in total?",
      "student_answer": "The bar is divided into 12 equal parts, so there are **12 parts in total**."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the number of divisions when a horizontal bar is split into equal parts of 1/4?",
      "student_answer": "The bar is divided into four equal parts (each part is\u202f\u00bc of the whole), so the number of divisions is **4**."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A horizontal bar is divided into 3 equal sections. What fraction of the bar does each section represent?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the three equal sections represents one\u2011third of the bar, i.e. \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{3}\\)."
