      "question": "A square is divided into 9 equal sections. What shape are the sections?",
      "student_answer": "The square is divided into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, so each of the nine equal sections is itself a **smaller square**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into 16 equal smaller squares, they are arranged in a 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 grid.  \n**Therefore, there are 4 rows and 4 columns of smaller squares.**"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "A square is divided into 25 equal parts. How many parts are in each row?",
      "student_answer": "Each row contains **5 parts**. (Since a square divided into 25 equal squares forms a 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 grid, there are \u221a25\u202f=\u202f5 parts per side.)"

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into more equal sections, each section must occupy a smaller portion of the whole.  \n**Therefore, the size (area) of each part gets smaller as the number of equal sections increases.**"

      "question": "If a square is divided horizontally and vertically into 4 equal sections, what is the shape of each section?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the four sections is itself a **square** (a smaller square of equal size)."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013 a square can be split into congruent (equal\u2011shaped and equal\u2011area) triangles.  \n\nThe simplest way is to draw one of the two diagonals of the square. The diagonal connects opposite corners and cuts the square into two right\u2011isosceles triangles. Each triangle has the same side lengths (half\u2011the\u2011side of the square, the full side, and the diagonal) and therefore the same shape and area.\n\nYou can also create more than two equal triangles. For example, draw both diagonals; they intersect at the centre and divide the square into four congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles. Another common construction is to join the centre of the square to each of the four vertices; this also yields four equal triangles (each is an isosceles triangle with the centre as the apex).\n\nIn general, any regular polygon can be partitioned into a number of congruent triangles by joining the centre to each vertex, and a square is just a special case of that rule. So a square can certainly be divided into equal triangles; the only requirement is that the lines you draw respect the symmetry of the square so that each resulting triangle is identical to the others."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "Each smaller square will have a side length of  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{\\sqrt{36}}=\\frac{12}{6}=2.\n\\]\n\nSo the side of each of the 36 equal smaller squares is **2 units**."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is partitioned into **equal rectangles**, the cuts that create the pieces are made parallel to just one pair of opposite sides (or, if cuts are made in both directions, the resulting pieces are still rectangles but not squares).  \n\nA rectangle has two side\u2011lengths that are **different**: one is the length, the other is the width.  \nA square is a special rectangle whose **length\u202f=\u202fwidth**.\n\nIf the original square has side\u2011length \\(s\\) and we slice it into \\(n\\) equal rectangles by drawing \\(n-1\\) cuts parallel to one side, each piece will have:\n\n* one dimension equal to the full side of the original square, \\(s\\);\n* the other dimension equal to \\(\\frac{s}{n}\\) (or \\(\\frac{s}{k}\\) for some integer \\(k\\) if we cut the other way).\n\nSince \\(s \\neq \\frac{s}{n}\\) for any integer \\(n>1\\), the two dimensions of each piece are **not equal**, so none of the pieces can be squares.  \n\nOnly if we cut the square **both horizontally and vertically** into a grid of \\(m\\) rows and \\(m\\) columns (so each small piece has side\u2011length \\(\\frac{s}{m}\\)) would the pieces be squares. But then the pieces are **equal squares**, not equal rectangles.\n\nThus, dividing a square into equal rectangles inevitably yields shapes whose side\u2011lengths differ, and therefore the resulting parts cannot be squares."

      "student_answer": "Here is a simple sketch of the large square broken into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid (9 equal smaller squares).  \nThe original square has side\u202f=\u202f3\u202funits, so each tiny square is a **1\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u2011unit** square.\n\n```\n+---+---+---+\n|   |   |   |   \u2190 each small square\u2019s side = 1 unit\n+---+---+---+\n|   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+\n|   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+\n```\n\n**Dimensions of each smaller square**\n\n- **Side length:** 1 unit  \n- **Area:** 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f=\u202f1\u202fsquare unit  \n\nSince the large square is split evenly into three rows and three columns, the side of each little square is simply the original side divided by 3:\n\n\\[\n\\text{small\u2011square side} = \\frac{3\\ \\text{units}}{3} = 1\\ \\text{unit}.\n\\]\n\nSo every one of the nine sections measures **1\u202funit\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202funit**."
