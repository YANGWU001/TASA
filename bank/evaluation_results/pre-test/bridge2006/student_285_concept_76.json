      "student_answer": "To find the greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers you usually do the following steps:\n\n1. **List the factors** \u2013 Write down all of the positive factors of each number.  \n   (For example, for 12 the factors are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f12; for 18 they are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f18.)\n\n2. **Identify the common factors** \u2013 Look at the two lists and pick out the numbers that appear in both lists.  \n   In the example the common factors are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f6.\n\n3. **Choose the greatest one** \u2013 The largest number that is common to both lists is the GCF.  \n   So the GCF of 12 and 18 is 6.\n\n4. **(Optional) Use the Euclidean algorithm** \u2013 If the numbers are large, you can subtract the smaller from the larger repeatedly (or use the division version) until you get a remainder of\u202f0; the last non\u2011zero remainder is the GCF.  \n\n5. **(Common mistake to avoid)** \u2013 You do **not** multiply the common factors together; you simply pick the biggest single factor that both numbers share.  \n\nThat\u2019s the general process for finding the GCF of two numbers."

      "student_answer": "The Euclidean algorithm finds the greatest common factor (GCF) by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder that comes from dividing it by the smaller number.\n\n1. **Start** with the two numbers, call them\u202f\\(a\\)\u202f(the larger) and\u202f\\(b\\)\u202f(the smaller).  \n2. **Divide**\u202f\\(a\\)\u202fby\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fto get a quotient and a remainder\u202f\\(r\\):  \n   \\[\n   a = b\\;q + r\\qquad(0\\le r < b)\n   \\]  \n3. **Replace**\u202f\\(a\\)\u202fwith\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fwith\u202f\\(r\\).  \n4. **Repeat** steps\u202f2\u20113 until the remainder\u202f\\(r\\)\u202fis\u202f0.  \n5. The last non\u2011zero remainder is the GCF.\n\n**Example (48 and 18)**  \n- 48\u202f=\u202f18\u00b72\u202f+\u202f12 \u2192 remainder\u202f12  \n- 18\u202f=\u202f12\u00b71\u202f+\u202f6  \u2192 remainder\u202f6  \n- 12\u202f=\u202f6\u00b72\u202f+\u202f0   \u2192 remainder\u202f0  \n\nThe last non\u2011zero remainder is\u202f6, so \\(\\text{GCF}(48,18)=6\\).\n\n---\n\nI think you can also stop after the first division if the remainder is less than half of the divisor, because then the GCF will be that remainder. (Not always true, but it sometimes works.)  \n\nAlso, if you ever get a remainder of\u202f1, the GCF is automatically\u202f2. (Actually, a remainder of\u202f1 means the two numbers are relatively prime, so the GCF is\u202f1; this statement is a common mistake.)"

      "student_answer": "Finding the greatest common factor (GCF) lets you \u201ccancel out\u2019\u2019 the biggest number that both the numerator and the denominator share, so the fraction is written in its lowest\u2011terms form.  When a fraction is reduced it\u2019s easier to see its size, compare it to other fractions, and do arithmetic with it.\n\n**Example (correct)** \u2013 Take the fraction \\(\\frac{24}{36}\\).  \nThe GCF of 24 and 36 is 12, so we divide both top and bottom by 12:  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{24\\div 12}{36\\div 12}= \\frac{2}{3}.\n\\]\n\nNow the fraction is in simplest form; you can\u2019t reduce \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) any further.\n\n**Example (I think this one is a bit off)** \u2013 Consider \\(\\frac{18}{24}\\).  \nI think the GCF is 4, so dividing gives  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{18\\div 4}{24\\div 4}= \\frac{9}{12},\n\\]\n\nwhich still can be simplified further (the real GCF is 6, giving \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)).
