  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of rewriting subtraction of negative integers as addition. Most answers are correct, with clear explanations and calculations. However, in Question 9, the student incorrectly calculated the result as 25 instead of the correct answer, which is 25. This indicates a minor error in arithmetic. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concept.",

      "question": "Explain why subtracting a negative integer is equivalent to adding a positive integer.",
      "student_answer": "When we subtract a negative integer, we are really taking away the opposite of a positive amount.  \nIn symbols,  \n\n\\[\na - (-b) = a + b .\n\\]\n\nThe \u201cminus\u201d sign in front of the parentheses tells us to change the sign of whatever is inside before we combine it with the first number. Changing \\(-b\\) to its opposite gives \\(+b\\), so the subtraction turns into addition.\n\nYou can see this on a number line: starting at \\(a\\), moving to the left would be \u201csubtracting a positive.\u201d But the instruction says \u201csubtract a negative,\u201d which means we move in the opposite direction of \u201csubtract a positive\u201d \u2013 that is, we move to the right. Moving right by \\(|b|\\) units is exactly what adding \\(+b\\) does.\n\nSo, subtracting a negative integer is equivalent to adding the corresponding positive integer because the double\u2011negative (the subtraction sign and the negative sign of the integer) cancel each other out, leaving a single addition sign. This is why\u202f\\(a - (-b)\\) always increases the original value by \\(b\\)."

      "student_answer": "**Example \u2013 Banking (account balance):**\n\nImagine you have a checking account that is **\u2011$150** (you\u2019re $150 in overdraft).  \nIf the bank applies a fee of **\u2011$30** to your account, the change to your balance is written as  \n\n\\[\n\\text{New balance}=(-150) - (-30)\n\\]\n\nSubtracting a negative number is the same as adding its opposite:\n\n\\[\n(-150) - (-30) = (-150) + 30 = -120.\n\\]\n\nSo instead of thinking of the fee as \u201csubtracting a negative $30,\u201d you can rewrite the operation as **adding $30** to the overdraft, which raises the balance from \u2013$150 to \u2013$120.
