      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) of a set of whole numbers is the largest integer that divides each of those numbers exactly, leaving no remainder. In other words, it is the biggest number that is a factor of every number in the group.  \n\nThe GCF is useful for:\n- Simplifying fractions (by dividing the numerator and denominator by their GCF),\n- Factoring algebraic expressions, and\n- Solving problems that involve grouping or partitioning objects into equal sets.  \n\nSo, the GCF represents the biggest \u201ccommon divisor\u2019\u2019 that the given numbers share."
