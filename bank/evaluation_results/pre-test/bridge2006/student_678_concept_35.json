      "question": "If you divide a square into 16 equal parts, how many rows and columns of smaller squares are there?",
      "student_answer": "There would be **4 rows** and **4 columns** of the smaller squares, forming a 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 grid (since 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f16)."

      "question": "A square is divided into 25 equal parts. How many parts are in each row?",
      "student_answer": "The square must be arranged in a 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 grid, so each row contains **5 parts**."

      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into more equal sections, each individual part becomes **smaller** \u2013 the area (or size) of each piece decreases as the number of equal pieces increases."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013 a square can be broken up into congruent (equal\u2011shaped and equal\u2011area) triangles.  \n\nThe simplest way is to draw one of the square\u2019s diagonals. The diagonal cuts the square into two right\u2011isosceles triangles that are mirror images of each other, so they have exactly the same shape and area.  \n\nIf you draw both diagonals you get four little right\u2011isosceles triangles, each again identical to the others.  \n\nThe reason this works is that a diagonal (or any line through the centre that joins opposite vertices) divides the square into pieces that share the same side lengths and angles, so the pieces are congruent.  \n\n(If you tried to make an odd number of equal triangles that all meet at a single point, you would run into a problem because the angles around that point must add to 360\u00b0, which generally requires an even number of identical triangles. But for two, four, eight, etc., you can always do it.)"

      "student_answer": "The 36 equal squares will form a \\(6 \\times 6\\) grid (since \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\)).  \nSo each side of a small square is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{original side length}}{6}= \\frac{12}{6}=2.\n\\]\n\n**Each smaller square has side length\u202f2 (units).**"

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When we cut a square into several **equal\u2011area rectangles**, each piece must keep the same total area as the others, but the shape of each piece changes.\n\nA square has all four sides the same length, say \\(s\\).  \nIf we slice the square with a single set of parallel cuts (for example, vertical cuts) into \\(n\\) equal parts, each part will have  \n\n* height\u202f=\u202f\\(s\\) (the same as the original square)  \n* width\u202f=\u202f\\(\\dfrac{s}{n}\\)\n\nSince the width is \\(\\dfrac{s}{n}\\) and the height is \\(s\\), the two side lengths are **different** whenever \\(n>1\\). A rectangle is a quadrilateral whose opposite sides are equal, but it is a **square only when its length and width are equal**. Because \\(\\dfrac{s}{n}\\neq s\\) for any \\(n>1\\), the resulting pieces are rectangles, not squares.\n\nThe same reasoning holds if we cut horizontally, or if we create a grid of rectangles by cutting both vertically and horizontally but using different numbers of cuts in each direction. Only when the cuts divide the original side into the same number of equal parts in both directions (e.g., a 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 grid) do the pieces become smaller squares. Otherwise the resulting shapes have unequal side lengths, so they are rectangles rather than squares.\n\nIn short, dividing a square into several equal\u2011area rectangles forces each piece to have one side equal to the original side length and the other side shorter, so the pieces cannot satisfy the definition of a square. The only time a subdivision of a square yields squares is when the cuts are made equally in both directions, producing a grid of smaller squares."
