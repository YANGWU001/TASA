      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) of a set of integers is the largest positive integer that divides each of those numbers exactly (i.e., with no remainder). In other words, it is the biggest number that is a factor of every integer in the collection. \n\n- **Why it matters:** The GCF is used to simplify fractions, reduce ratios, and solve problems that involve dividing objects into equal groups. \n- **How it\u2019s found:** One common method is to list the prime factorization of each number, then multiply together the prime factors they have in common, using each common prime the smallest number of times it appears in any factorization. Another method is to use the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly applies the division algorithm until the remainder is zero; the last non\u2011zero remainder is the GCF. \n\nSo, the GCF represents the \u201cgreatest\u201d (largest) factor that all the given numbers share."
