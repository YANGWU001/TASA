      "question": "How can you use divisibility rules to efficiently list factors of a large number?",
      "student_answer": "**Using divisibility rules to speed up the search for factors**\n\n1. **Quickly eliminate obvious non\u2011candidates**  \n   - **2** \u2013 any even number (last digit\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8) is divisible by\u202f2.  \n   - **3** \u2013 if the sum of the digits is a multiple of\u202f3, the whole number is.  \n   - **5** \u2013 numbers ending in\u202f0 or\u202f5 are multiples of\u202f5.  \n   - **10** \u2013 a trailing\u202f0 means the number is divisible by\u202f10.  \n\n   By checking these first you can immediately write down 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f10 (and their products) as factors whenever the rule applies.\n\n2. **Apply the \u201clast\u2011two\u2011digits\u201d rule for 4 and 8**  \n   - **4** \u2013 look at the last two digits. If that two\u2011digit number is a multiple of\u202f4, the whole number is.  \n   - **8** \u2013 look at the last three digits. If that three\u2011digit number is a multiple of\u202f8, the whole number is.  \n\n3. **Use the \u201calternating\u2011sum\u201d rule for 11**  \n   - Subtract the sum of the digits in the odd positions from the sum of the digits in the even positions. If the result is 0 or a multiple of\u202f11, the original number is divisible by\u202f11.\n\n4. **The \u201cdouble\u2011last\u2011digit\u201d rule for 7**  \n   - Remove the last digit, double it, and subtract that from the truncated part of the number. If the result is 0,\u202f7,\u202f14,\u202f21 \u2026 (i.e., a multiple of\u202f7), the original number is divisible by\u202f7.\n\n5. **Combine the small\u2011prime tests to build the prime factorisation**  \n   - Start with the smallest primes (2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13 \u2026).  \n   - Whenever a rule says \u201cyes\u201d, divide the number by that prime and write down the factor. Keep the quotient and repeat the same tests on the new, smaller number.  \n   - Because each division reduces the size of the number, the subsequent tests become faster.\n\n6. **Generate all factors from the prime factorisation**  \n   - Suppose after testing you obtain  \n     \\[\n     N = 2^{a}\\,3^{b}\\,5^{c}\\,7^{d}\\,\\dots\n     \\]\n   - Every factor of\u202f\\(N\\) is obtained by choosing any exponent from 0 up to the exponent in the factorisation for each prime and multiplying the chosen powers together.  \n   - List the combinations systematically (e.g., nested loops or a short table) to get the complete factor list.\n\n7. **Skip unnecessary work**  \n   - You only need to test primes up to \\(\\sqrt{N}\\). Once the current quotient drops below the square of the next prime you haven\u2019t tried, you can stop; any remaining quotient (if >\u202f1) must itself be prime and is the final factor.  \n   - The divisibility rules let you decide very quickly whether a prime needs to be tried at all, so you avoid many fruitless divisions.\n\n---\n\n### Mini\u2011example (illustrative)\n\nFind the factors of **2\u202f016**.\n\n| Step | Test | Result | Action |\n|------|------|--------|--------|\n|\u202f1\u202f| Last digit even \u2192 divisible by\u202f2 | Yes | Write 2, divide \u2192 2\u202f016\u202f\u00f7\u202f2 = **1\u202f008** |\n|\u202f2\u202f| Sum of digits\u202f=\u202f1+0+0+8\u202f=\u202f9 \u2192 divisible by\u202f3 | Yes | Write 3, divide \u2192 1\u202f008\u202f\u00f7\u202f3 = **336** |\n|\u202f3\u202f| Last digit even \u2192 divisible by\u202f2 | Yes | Write another 2, divide \u2192 336\u202f\u00f7\u202f2 = **168** |\n|\u202f4\u202f| Last two digits\u202f=\u202f68 \u2192 divisible by\u202f4 | Yes | Write 4 (or another 2\u00d72), divide \u2192 168\u202f\u00f7\u202f4 = **42** |\n|\u202f5\u202f| \u201cDouble\u2011last\u2011digit\u201d test \u2192 42 is a known multiple of\u202f7 | Yes | Write 7, divide \u2192 42\u202f\u00f7\u202f7 = **6** |\n|\u202f6\u202f| 6 is 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3, both already accounted for | \u2013 | Stop (quotient\u202f=\u202f6\u202f<\u202f\u221a42) |\n\nPrime factorisation:  \n\\(2\u202f016 = 2^{5}\\times3^{2}\\times7\\).\n\nAll factors are obtained by choosing powers of 2 (0\u20115), 3 (0\u20112) and 7 (0\u20111) and multiplying them, giving 36 distinct factors (e.g., 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f7,\u202f8,\u202f12,\u202f14,\u2026,\u202f2\u202f016).\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nDivisibility rules let you decide in a split\u2011second whether a prime divisor is worth trying. By repeatedly applying the appropriate rule, you shrink the number quickly, obtain its prime factorisation, and then enumerate every factor without having to test every integer up to the original number."

      "student_answer": "A **factor** (or divisor) of an integer\u202f\\(n\\) is any integer\u202f\\(d\\) that divides \\(n\\) with no remainder; in other words, there exists an integer\u202f\\(k\\) such that  \n\n\\[\nn = d \\times k .\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Why \\(1\\) is a factor of every integer  \n\nFor any integer \\(n\\) we can always write  \n\n\\[\nn = 1 \\times n .\n\\]\n\nHere the multiplier \\(k\\) is simply the number itself, \\(k = n\\). Since the product of \\(1\\) and \\(n\\) gives back \\(n\\) exactly, the division  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{n}{1}=n\n\\]\n\nleaves no remainder. Therefore \\(1\\) satisfies the definition of a divisor for **every** integer (positive, negative, or zero).  \n\nBecause the definition of a factor only requires an integer multiplier, the statement holds for all integers, which is why \\(1\\) is called the *universal* or *trivial* factor.\n\n---\n\n### Why the number itself is always its largest factor  \n\nAgain, using the definition of a factor, we can write  \n\n\\[\nn = n \\times 1 .\n\\]\n\nIn this case the multiplier \\(k\\) is \\(1\\). The division  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{n}{n}=1\n\\]\n\nalso leaves no remainder, so \\(n\\) is a divisor of itself.\n\nNow consider any other positive factor \\(d\\) of \\(n\\). By definition there exists an integer \\(k\\) with  \n\n\\[\nn = d \\times k .\n\\]\n\nBoth \\(d\\) and \\(k\\) are positive integers (if we restrict ourselves to positive factors). Since their product is \\(n\\), each of them must be **less than or equal to** \\(n\\); the only way a factor can equal \\(n\\) is when the other multiplier is \\(1\\). Consequently, no positive factor other than \\(n\\) can be larger than \\(n\\). Hence \\(n\\) is the **largest** positive factor of itself.\n\n---\n\n### Summary  \n\n- **1** is a factor of every integer because multiplying any integer by 1 returns the original integer, satisfying the factor definition.  \n- The **number itself** is always a factor (via multiplication by 1) and cannot be exceeded by any other positive factor, making it the largest factor of that number.  \n\nThese two facts are fundamental and form the basis for many other properties of divisibility and prime factorization."
