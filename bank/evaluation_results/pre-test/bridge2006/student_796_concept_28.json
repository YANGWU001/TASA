      "student_answer": "To find out whether a number\u202f\\(a\\)\u202fis a factor (or divisor) of another number\u202f\\(b\\), you need to check whether\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fcan be divided by\u202f\\(a\\)\u202fwithout leaving any remainder. Here\u2019s a step\u2011by\u2011step way to do it:\n\n1. **Perform the division**  \n   Compute the quotient \\(q = \\frac{b}{a}\\).  \n   You can do this with long division, a calculator, or mental math if the numbers are small.\n\n2. **Check the remainder**  \n   - If the division comes out **exactly** (i.e., the remainder is\u202f0), then \\(a\\) divides \\(b\\) evenly and \\(a\\) is a factor of \\(b\\).  \n   - If there is any non\u2011zero remainder, then \\(a\\) is **not** a factor of \\(b\\).\n\n   In notation, \\(a\\) is a factor of \\(b\\) \u21d4 \\(b \\mod a = 0\\).\n\n3. **Alternative method \u2013 prime factorization (useful for large numbers)**  \n   - Break both numbers down into their prime factors.  \n   - If every prime factor of \\(a\\) appears in the prime factorization of \\(b\\) with at least as high an exponent, then \\(a\\) is a factor of \\(b\\).  \n   - Example: \\(a = 12 = 2^2 \\cdot 3\\) and \\(b = 84 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7\\). All the prime factors of 12 are present in 84 with equal or greater powers, so 12 is a factor of 84.\n\n4. **Quick mental checks for small divisors**  \n   - **2**: a number ending in an even digit (0,2,4,6,8).  \n   - **3**: sum of its digits is a multiple of 3.  \n   - **5**: ends in 0 or 5.  \n   - **10**: ends in 0.  \n   These shortcuts can tell you instantly whether the number is a factor of the larger number without doing the full division.\n\n5. **Using modular arithmetic (especially in programming)**  \n   - In many programming languages you can test with `if (b % a == 0)`, where `%` gives the remainder.  \n   - This is exactly the same as the remainder test described in step\u202f2.\n\n**Summary:**  \nA number \\(a\\) is a factor of another number \\(b\\) if dividing \\(b\\) by \\(a\\) produces no remainder. You can verify this by direct division, by checking the remainder, by comparing prime factorizations, or by using simple divisibility rules for common small factors."

      "question": "How can you use divisibility rules to efficiently list factors of a large number?",
      "student_answer": "**Using divisibility rules to list factors efficiently**\n\n1. **Start with the smallest primes**  \n   Apply the familiar divisibility tests (2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, \u2026) to the target number\u202f\\(N\\).  \n   - *2*:\u202f\\(N\\) is even \u2192\u202ffactor\u202f2.  \n   - *3*:\u202fSum of digits divisible by\u202f3 \u2192\u202ffactor\u202f3.  \n   - *5*:\u202fLast digit 0 or\u202f5 \u2192\u202ffactor\u202f5.  \n   - *7,\u202f11,\u202f13*:\u202fUse the known short\u2011hand tricks (e.g., double the last digit and subtract from the rest for\u202f7).  \n\n   Each time a test succeeds, divide \\(N\\) by that prime and record the quotient. Continue testing the same prime on the new quotient until it no longer divides evenly. This yields the **prime\u2011power decomposition** of \\(N\\):\n   \\[\n   N = 2^{a}\\,3^{b}\\,5^{c}\\,7^{d}\\,\\dots\n   \\]\n\n2. **Build the complete factor list from the prime\u2011power form**  \n   If \\(N = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2}\\dots p_k^{e_k}\\), every factor is obtained by choosing an exponent for each prime between\u202f0\u202fand its maximum:\n   \\[\n   \\text{factor} = p_1^{f_1} p_2^{f_2}\\dots p_k^{f_k},\n   \\qquad 0 \\le f_i \\le e_i .\n   \\]\n   Enumerate all possible exponent combinations. For example, if  \n   \\(N = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5\\), the number of factors is \\((3+1)(2+1)(1+1)=24\\).\n\n3. **Use divisibility shortcuts to prune the search**  \n   - **Even\u2011odd rule**: If the factor you are testing is odd, you can ignore any combination that includes a 2\u2011power >\u202f0.  \n   - **Digit\u2011sum rule**: For any candidate factor containing a 3\u2011power, its digit sum must be a multiple of\u202f3. This quickly discards impossible combos.  \n   - **End\u2011digit rule**: If a candidate includes a factor\u202f5, its last digit must be 0 or\u202f5.  \n\n   Applying these rules while you generate exponent combinations avoids constructing numbers that you can immediately rule out, saving time.\n\n4. **Check only up to \\(\\sqrt{N}\\) for \u201cnew\u201d factors**  \n   When you list factors, you only need to generate the smaller member of each complementary pair \\((d,\\;N/d)\\). As soon as a generated factor exceeds \\(\\sqrt{N}\\), you stop; the corresponding larger factor is already accounted for.\n\n5. **Example** \u2013 Find the factors of \\(N = 2,520\\):\n\n   1. Divisibility tests:  \n      - Even \u2192\u202f2, divide \u2192\u202f1260 \u2192\u202f2 again \u2192\u202f630 \u2192\u202f2 again \u2192\u202f315 (stop, now odd).  \n      - Sum of digits\u202f\\(=3+1+5=9\\) \u2192\u202f3 divides \u2192\u202f315\u00f73 =\u202f105 \u2192\u202f3 again? 105 sum\u202f=6 \u2192\u202fyes \u2192\u202f105\u00f73 =\u202f35.  \n      - Ends in\u202f5 \u2192\u202f5 divides \u2192\u202f35\u00f75 =\u202f7.  \n      - 7 is prime.  \n\n      So \\(2,520 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7\\).\n\n   2. Number of factors: \\((3+1)(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)=4\u00b73\u00b72\u00b72=48\\).\n\n   3. Generate factors by picking exponents \\(0\\le a\\le3\\), \\(0\\le b\\le2\\), \\(0\\le c\\le1\\), \\(0\\le d\\le1\\).  \n      Using the rules above, we can skip any combination where the last digit would be 2,4,6,8 (because a factor containing 5 must end in 0 or\u202f5).  \n\n   4. List the smaller half (all \u2264\u202f\u221a2520 \u2248\u202f50.2). The first few are:  \n      1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f5,\u202f6,\u202f7,\u202f8,\u202f9,\u202f10,\u202f12,\u202f14,\u202f15,\u202f16,\u202f18,\u202f20,\u202f21,\u202f24,\u202f28,\u202f30,\u202f35,\u202f36,\u202f40,\u202f42,\u202f45,\u202f48,\u202f49,\u202f50.\n\n   5. Each of these automatically gives its complementary partner (e.g., 1\u21942520,\u202f2\u21941260,\u202f3\u2194840, \u2026).\n\n**Key take\u2011aways**\n\n- Apply simple divisibility tests first to peel off prime factors quickly.  \n- Translate the prime\u2011power decomposition into exponent combinations; this guarantees you\u2019ll generate **all** factors without missing any.  \n- While enumerating, use the same divisibility insights (even\u2011odd, digit\u2011sum, last\u2011digit) to discard impossible combinations early, keeping the list\u2011building process fast even for very large numbers."

Because this identity holds for **every** integer \\(n\\), the number\u202f1 satisfies the definition of a factor for all integers. Hence, 1 is a universal factor.\n\n---\n\n**Why a number is always its largest factor**\n\nAgain using the definition of a factor: a number \\(d\\) is a factor of \\(n\\) if there exists an integer \\(k\\) such that \\(n = d \\times k\\).\n\nIf we set \\(d = n\\), we obtain  \n\n\\[\nn = n \\times 1 .\n\\]\n\nHere the multiplier \\(k\\) is 1, which is an integer, so \\(n\\) divides itself. Therefore, every integer is a factor of itself.\n\nNow consider any other factor \\(d\\) of \\(n\\) that is not equal to \\(n\\). By definition we would have  \n\n\\[\nn = d \\times k\n\\]\n\nwith \\(k > 1\\) (otherwise \\(d\\) would be \\(n\\) itself). Since \\(k\\) is at least 2, the product \\(d \\times k\\) is larger than \\(d\\). This means every proper factor \\(d\\) is **strictly less** than the number \\(n\\) it divides. Consequently, among all the factors of \\(n\\), the number \\(n\\) itself is the greatest.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- **1** is a factor of every integer because any integer can be expressed as \\(1 \\times n\\).\n- **The number itself** is always its largest factor because it can be expressed as \\(n \\times 1\\), and any other factor must be smaller (its complementary multiplier must be larger than 1)."
