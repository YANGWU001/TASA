  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of counting shaded parts in vertical bars. Most answers correctly identify the number of shaded parts. However, there were some misunderstandings regarding the concept of contiguous sections, particularly in Question 6 and Question 10, where the definitions were not applied correctly. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the material.",

      "question": "A vertical bar is divided into 8 equal sections. If 5 sections are shaded, count the number of shaded parts.",
      "student_answer": "The bar is split into 8 equal parts, and 5 of those parts are shaded.  \nTherefore, the number of shaded parts is **5**."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If a vertical bar shows 6 shaded parts out of 15 sections, how many shaded parts are contiguous?",
      "student_answer": "The six shaded parts can all be placed next to one another, so the number of contiguous shaded parts is **6**."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "A vertical bar is divided into 20 segments, and 10 consecutive parts are shaded. How many shaded parts are there?",
      "student_answer": "The bar has 10 consecutive parts that are shaded, so the number of shaded parts is **10**."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Examine a vertical bar divided into 9 sections. If 3 non-contiguous parts are shaded, how many contiguous shaded parts can you count?",
      "student_answer": "The three shaded sections are isolated from one another, so each forms its own contiguous block.  \n**Number of contiguous shaded parts = 3.**"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If a vertical bar has 18 sections with 6 shaded parts in a row, what is the count of shaded parts?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 6 shaded parts."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "A vertical bar shows 4 shaded parts out of 10 total sections. Are all shaded parts contiguous? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "The fact that the bar has **4 shaded parts out of 10 sections** tells us only the quantity of shading, not how those shaded sections are positioned.  \n\n- **If the four shaded sections occupy consecutive positions** (for example, sections\u202f1\u20114, 5\u20118, etc.), then they are **contiguous** \u2013 there is one uninterrupted block of shading.  \n- **If the shaded sections are spread out** (e.g., sections\u202f1,\u202f3,\u202f6,\u202f9), then they are **not contiguous** \u2013 there are gaps of unshaded sections between them.\n\nBecause the description does not specify the arrangement of the four shaded parts, we cannot determine from the information given whether they are contiguous. We would need to see the actual visual layout of the bar to decide."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "A vertical bar is divided into 16 parts, where 5 shaded parts are non-contiguous. How does this affect the count of contiguous shaded sections?",
      "student_answer": "Because the five shaded pieces are **non\u2011contiguous**, none of them touch each other.  \nIn a vertical bar, a \u201ccontiguous shaded section\u201d is a group of shaded parts that are directly adjacent.  \nSince each of the five shaded parts stands alone, each one constitutes its own contiguous block.\n\n**Thus the number of contiguous shaded sections is 5.**"
