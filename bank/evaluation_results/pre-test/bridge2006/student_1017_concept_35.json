      "question": "If a square is divided horizontally and vertically into 4 equal sections, what is the shape of each section?",
      "student_answer": "Each of the four sections is itself a **square**. By drawing one horizontal line and one vertical line through the center of the original square, the shape is divided into four congruent smaller squares."

      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013 a square can be partitioned into congruent (equal\u2011size) triangles.  \nThe important point is that the triangles must be **congruent** (same shape and size) and together they must fill the whole square without overlap or gaps.\n\n### Simple examples  \n\n| Number of triangles | Construction |\n|---------------------|--------------|\n| **2** | Draw one of the square\u2019s diagonals. The diagonal splits the square into two right\u2011isosceles triangles that are mirror images of each other. |\n| **4** | Connect the centre of the square to each of the four vertices. This gives four congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles whose legs are half the side of the original square. |\n| **8** | Subdivide each of the four triangles from the previous step by drawing a line from the centre to the midpoint of each side. The result is eight congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles. |\n| **\\(2^k\\)** (for any integer \\(k\\ge 1\\)) | Repeatedly halve each triangle by drawing a line from its right\u2011angle vertex to the midpoint of the hypotenuse. After \\(k\\) repetitions you obtain \\(2^{k+1}\\) congruent triangles. |\n\nAll of these constructions work because a right\u2011isosceles triangle can be reflected or rotated to match another one, and the angles at each interior point add up to \\(360^\\circ\\) exactly.\n\n### Why it works (and why some numbers are impossible)\n\n- **Even numbers**: A square has four right angles (each \\(90^\\circ\\)). When you tile it with congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles, each triangle contributes a \\(45^\\circ\\) angle at the centre (or at any interior point where triangles meet). Because \\(45^\\circ\\) divides evenly into \\(360^\\circ\\), you can have any even number of such triangles (\\(2,4,8,\\dots\\)).  \n\n- **Odd numbers (other than 1)**: It is impossible to fill a square with an odd number of congruent non\u2011degenerate triangles. The reason is that each interior vertex where triangles meet must have a total angle of \\(360^\\circ\\). Since each triangle contributes a fixed angle (e.g., \\(45^\\circ\\) for a right\u2011isosceles triangle), you need an integer multiple of that angle to reach \\(360^\\circ\\). For the common right\u2011isosceles case, the smallest divisor of \\(360^\\circ\\) that is also a multiple of \\(45^\\circ\\) is \\(8\\), giving an even count. More generally, parity arguments show that you cannot have an odd tiling unless the whole square itself is the single triangle (which would mean the \u201ctriangle\u201d is actually the square, not a proper triangle).  \n\n- **Other shapes of triangles**: If you allow triangles that are not right\u2011isosceles, you can still tile a square, but the same parity restriction holds: the number of congruent triangles must be even. An example is dividing the square into four congruent acute triangles by drawing both diagonals and then rotating each of the resulting four right triangles about the centre.\n\n### Bottom line\nA square can certainly be divided into equal (congruent) triangles\u2014commonly into 2, 4, 8, \u2026 triangles\u2014by drawing appropriate lines such as a diagonal, lines to the centre, or successive bisections. The division works because the angles and side lengths can be matched perfectly. However, apart from the trivial case of a single \u201ctriangle\u201d that is the whole square, you cannot tile a square with an odd number of congruent proper triangles."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When we cut a square into several **congruent** pieces, the pieces are forced to share at least one side with the original square.  \nBecause a square has all four sides the same length, any cut that runs only in one direction (horizontal *or* vertical) will produce pieces whose two side\u2011lengths are different:\n\n* Suppose the original square has side\u2011length **S**.  \n* If we draw **n** equally\u2011spaced vertical lines, we obtain **n** rectangles each **(S\u202f\u00f7\u202fn)\u202f\u00d7\u202fS**.  \n* Their width is **S\u202f\u00f7\u202fn**, but their height remains **S**.  \n* Since **S\u202f\u00f7\u202fn \u2260 S** (for any n\u202f>\u202f1), the width and height are not equal, so each piece is a rectangle, not a square.\n\nThe only way the resulting pieces could also be squares is if **both** dimensions of each piece are equal. That would require us to cut the original square in **both** the horizontal and vertical directions, dividing it into a grid of smaller squares (e.g., 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2, 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3, \u2026). In that case the pieces are **equal squares**, not \u201crectangles\u201d.\n\nThus, when we speak of \u201cdividing a square into equal rectangles,\u201d we usually mean dividing it by parallel lines in a single direction. The resulting parts have one side equal to the full side of the original square and the other side a fraction of it, so their side lengths differ. Because a square demands equal side lengths, these parts cannot be squares; they are rectangles instead."
