      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into more equal sections, each individual part becomes **smaller**.  \nIf the whole square has area\u202f\\(A\\) and it is split into \\(n\\) equal parts, the area of each part is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of one part}= \\frac{A}{n}.\n\\]\n\nAs the number of sections \\(n\\) increases, the denominator grows, so the fraction \\(\\frac{A}{n}\\) gets smaller. Thus, the more equal sections you create, the less area (and consequently the smaller the side lengths) each piece will have."

      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Yes \u2013 a square can be divided into equal triangles.**  \n\nThe only thing that has to be satisfied is that the triangles together fill the whole area of the square without overlap and that they are congruent (identical in shape and size).  Because a square is a very regular shape, there are several simple ways to do this.\n\n---\n\n### 1.  Two equal right\u2011triangles  \n\nDraw one of the two diagonals of the square.  \nThe diagonal splits the square into two right\u2011isosceles triangles that are mirror images of each other.  \n\n*Each triangle has legs equal to the side of the square and a hypotenuse equal to the diagonal.*  \nSince the two triangles together have the same total area as the original square, this is a perfectly valid division.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Four equal right\u2011triangles  \n\nDraw **both** diagonals.  The two diagonals intersect at the centre of the square and partition it into four right\u2011isosceles triangles.  \n\nAll four triangles are congruent (each has legs\u202f=\u202f\u00bd\u202f\u00b7\u202fside of the square and hypotenuse\u202f=\u202fside of the square).  \nThus the square is tiled by four identical triangles.\n\n---\n\n### 3.  More than four equal triangles  \n\nBecause each of the above triangles is itself a right\u2011isosceles triangle, we can keep subdividing them in the same way.  \nFor example, draw the median of each of the four triangles (a line from the right\u2011angle vertex to the midpoint of the hypotenuse).  This splits every triangle into two smaller congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles, giving **eight** equal triangles in total.  \n\nRepeating the process yields \\(2, 4, 8, 16, \\dots\\) equal right\u2011isosceles triangles \u2013 any power\u2011of\u2011two number can be obtained this way.\n\n---\n\n### 4.  Why it works (and when it doesn\u2019t)\n\n* **Area matching** \u2013 The total area of the triangles must equal the area of the square.  When the triangles are congruent, each must have area \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) of the square\u2019s area, where \\(n\\) is the number of triangles.  The constructions above satisfy this automatically because they are based on straight\u2011line cuts that preserve area.\n\n* **Angle compatibility** \u2013 A square\u2019s interior angles are \\(90^\\circ\\).  A right\u2011isosceles triangle has two \\(45^\\circ\\) acute angles, so four of them fit perfectly around the centre (four \u00d7\u202f45\u00b0\u202f=\u202f180\u00b0) and two of them fill a half\u2011square (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f45\u00b0\u202f=\u202f90\u00b0).  This is why the diagonal and the pair of diagonals give exact tilings.\n\n* **Equilateral triangles** \u2013 If you specifically require *equilateral* triangles (all sides equal, each angle \\(60^\\circ\\)), a perfect tiling of a square with congruent equilateral triangles is **not** possible, because the angles around any point in the tiling would have to add up to \\(360^\\circ\\), but multiples of \\(60^\\circ\\) never give the \\(90^\\circ\\) corner angle of a square.  You can, however, tile a square with several **different\u2011sized** equilateral triangles (e.g., a \u201ctriangular mesh\u201d), just not with all of them being congruent.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\n\nA square **can** be divided into equal triangles\u2014most simply by using its diagonal(s) to produce two or four congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles, and by further subdividing those you can obtain any power of two number of equal triangles.  The only situation where you cannot do it is if you insist on a specific triangle shape (e.g., equilateral) that is geometrically incompatible with the 90\u00b0 corners of the square."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When a square is cut into *equal rectangles*, each piece keeps one dimension that is the full length of the original square and a second dimension that is only a fraction of that length.  \n\nA square has the defining property that **all four sides are the same length**.  \nA rectangle, however, only requires opposite sides to be equal; its two adjacent sides can be different lengths.\n\nSuppose the original square has side\u2011length \\(s\\). If we divide it into \\(k\\) equal rectangles by drawing \\(k-1\\) parallel cuts, each rectangle will have one side still equal to \\(s\\) (the side that runs the whole length of the original square) and the other side equal to \\(\\frac{s}{k}\\).  \n\nBecause \\(s \\neq \\frac{s}{k}\\) for any integer \\(k>1\\), the two adjacent sides of each piece are **not** equal, so the pieces cannot be squares\u2014they are rectangles with a longer and a shorter side.\n\nThe only way the resulting pieces could also be squares is to subdivide the original square into a grid of smaller squares (e.g., cut the side into \\(n\\) equal segments both horizontally and vertically). In that case the pieces are still squares, not \u201crectangles\u201d in the sense of having unequal side lengths.  \n\nThus, dividing a square into equal rectangles inevitably yields shapes whose adjacent sides differ in length, and therefore the parts are not squares."
