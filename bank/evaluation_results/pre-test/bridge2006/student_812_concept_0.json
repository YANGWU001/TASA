So the 7\u2011by\u20116 product would be the smaller quantity."

      "question": "A farmer planted 4 rows of 9 trees each. Another farmer planted 6 rows of 7 trees each. Who planted more trees?",
      "student_answer": "I think the first farmer planted more trees. He had 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f36 trees, while the second farmer had 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f42 trees, so actually the second farmer would have more, but I\u2019m a little unsure\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing them up."

      "student_answer": "I think Team\u202fA scored higher.  Since they got 6 points in each of the 8 games, that\u2019s about 48 points total, which is a bit more than Team\u202fB\u2019s 5\u202fpoints in 10 games."
