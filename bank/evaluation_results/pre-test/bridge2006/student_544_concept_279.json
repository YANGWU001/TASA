      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain how you can identify a negative integer on a number line.",
      "student_answer": "I think you can spot a negative integer on a number line by looking at where the point falls in relation to\u202f0.  \n- Anything that\u2019s **to the left of the zero mark** is less than\u202f0, so it\u2019s a negative number.  \n- Negative integers are the whole\u2011number points on that left\u2011hand side (\u20111,\u202f\u20112,\u202f\u20113, \u2026).  \n- On most number\u2011line drawings the points that are whole numbers are shown with longer tick marks or a little label; if those longer ticks are left of\u202f0 and have a \u201c\u2013\u201d sign in front of the number, they\u2019re the negative integers.\n\nSo, in short, find the zero, then any labeled whole\u2011number point left of it is a negative integer. (If the point is right of zero, it\u2019s positive, and if it\u2019s exactly at zero, it\u2019s neither.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you move three steps to the left from -2 on a number line, what negative integer will you land on?",

    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "What is the difference between negative integers and positive integers on a number line?",
      "student_answer": "I think negative integers are the whole numbers that are **less than\u202f0**, so on a typical horizontal number line they\u2019re drawn to the **left of the zero point**.  Positive integers are the whole numbers that are **greater than\u202f0**, and they appear to the **right of zero**.  \n\nOne difference is that as you move **leftward** you go from 0 to \u20131, \u20132, \u20133, \u2026, which are \u201csmaller\u201d in the sense of being more negative, while moving **rightward** from 0 you go to 1, 2, 3, \u2026, which are larger positive values.  \n\n(So the main idea is the sign: negatives on the left side of zero, positives on the right side.)"
