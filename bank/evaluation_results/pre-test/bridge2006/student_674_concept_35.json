      "question": "A square is divided into 9 equal sections. What shape are the sections?",
      "student_answer": "The square is split into a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 grid, so each of the 9 equal parts is itself a **smaller square**."

      "student_answer": "When a square is divided into 16 equal smaller squares, they are arranged in a 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 grid.  \nSo there are **4 rows** and **4 columns** of the smaller squares."

      "question": "A square is divided into 25 equal parts. How many parts are in each row?",
      "student_answer": "Each row contains **5 parts**. (Since\u202f\u221a25\u202f=\u202f5, the square is a 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 grid of equal parts.)"

      "question": "What happens to the size of each part when a square is divided into more equal sections?",
      "student_answer": "When a square is split into a greater number of equal sections, the area (and thus the size) of each individual part gets **smaller**.  \n\nMathematically, if the whole square has area \\(A\\) and it\u2019s divided into \\(n\\) equal pieces, each piece has area  \n\n\\[\n\\text{area of one piece}= \\frac{A}{n}.\n\\]\n\nAs \\(n\\) increases, the denominator grows, so the fraction \\(\\frac{A}{n}\\) becomes smaller. Consequently, each part occupies less space than before."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013 a square can be divided into congruent (equal\u2011size) triangles.  \nThe simplest way is to draw one of the two diagonals. The diagonal cuts the square into two right\u2011isosceles triangles that are identical in shape and size, so the square is completely tiled by equal triangles.\n\nYou can also get more than two equal triangles. For example:\n\n* **Four equal triangles:** Draw both diagonals, which intersect at the centre of the square. This creates four right\u2011isosceles triangles, each having the same legs (half the side of the original square) and the same right angle.\n* **Four equal triangles of another shape:** Connect the centre of the square to each of the four vertices. The result is four congruent triangles that are not right\u2011isosceles but are still equal in area and shape.\n\nWhat you cannot do is tile a square with **equilateral** triangles without leaving gaps, because the 60\u00b0 angles of an equilateral triangle do not fit together to fill the 90\u00b0 corners of a square. But any triangle that can be formed by cutting the square along straight lines through its interior (such as the right\u2011isosceles triangles above) will work.\n\nSo a square is not limited to being divided into smaller squares; it can also be partitioned into equal triangles, provided the triangles\u2019 angles and side lengths are compatible with the geometry of the square."

      "question": "If a square is divided into 36 equal parts, what is the length of each side of the smaller squares if the original square has side length 12?",
      "student_answer": "Since the 36 small squares are arranged in a regular grid, there must be \\( \\sqrt{36}=6 \\) squares along each side of the original square.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Side length of each small square}= \\frac{\\text{side length of original square}}{6}\n= \\frac{12}{6}=2.\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** Each smaller square has side length **2** (units)."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When we cut a square into several **equal** rectangles, we are keeping the **area** of each piece the same, but we are not forced to keep the **shape** the same as the original square.  \n\nA square has the special property that its two side lengths are equal (\u202f\\(s\\)\u202f).  \nA rectangle also has opposite sides equal, but its length and width can be different (\u202f\\(L\\neq W\\)\u202f).  \n\nIf we slice the square with a single straight cut that runs parallel to one side, we get two pieces whose areas are each half of the original area.  \n- The height of each piece is still the whole side\u2011length of the original square (\u202f\\(s\\)\u202f).  \n- The width of each piece is only half of the original side\u2011length (\u202f\\(s/2\\)\u202f).  \n\nThus each piece is a rectangle whose dimensions are \\(s\\)\u202fby\u202f\\(s/2\\). Because the two dimensions are not equal, the pieces are **not** squares.  \n\nThe same idea works for any number of equal rectangles: the division is usually done by drawing lines that are parallel to one pair of sides, so the resulting pieces share one full side of the original square while the other side is shortened to a fraction of that length. As long as the shortening factor is not\u202f1 (i.e., the pieces are not the whole square), the two side lengths will differ, giving a rectangle rather than a square.\n\nIn short, equal\u2011area division guarantees that each piece has the same **area**, but only a division that keeps both side lengths unchanged (i.e., no shortening in either direction) would preserve the square shape. Since the cuts usually shorten one dimension, the resulting parts are rectangles, not squares."
