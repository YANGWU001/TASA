  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of equal divisions in a horizontal bar. Most answers correctly identify the number of divisions based on the given sections. However, the answer to Question 3 does not directly address the number of divisions, which is why it received a score of 0. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the topic.",
