  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of GCF, correctly identifying it in various contexts and methods. Most answers are accurate, but the prime factorization method in Question 3 contains a calculation error, leading to an incorrect GCF. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the topic.",

      "student_answer": "The greatest common factor (GCF) of a set of integers is the largest positive integer that divides each of those numbers exactly (without leaving a remainder). In other words, it is the biggest \u201cshared\u201d factor that all the numbers have in common.  \n\nBecause it is the biggest such divisor, the GCF is useful for tasks such as:\n\n- Simplifying fractions (by canceling common factors in the numerator and denominator)  \n- Factoring numbers or algebraic expressions into products of smaller factors  \n- Solving problems that involve dividing objects into equal groups  \n\nSo, the GCF represents the maximum amount that can be taken out of each number (or each term) while still leaving whole\u2011number results."
