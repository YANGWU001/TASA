Draw a number line and label 0\u20119.  \n2. Mark the point at\u202f8 (larger) and the point at\u202f3 (smaller).  \n3. Move left from 8 toward 3, counting the unit steps: 8 \u2192 7 \u2192 6 \u2192 5 \u2192 4 \u2192 3.  \n4. You counted **5** steps.  \n\nTherefore, the difference is \\(8 - 3 = 5\\).\n\n---\n\n### Quick Checklist\n\n- \u2705 Make sure the larger number is on the right, the smaller on the left.  \n- \u2705 Count each unit interval **once**; do not skip any marks.  \n- \u2705 The count you obtain equals the numerical difference.  \n\nUsing a number line this way gives a visual, step\u2011by\u2011step method for finding the difference between any two positive integers."

      "student_answer": "Subtraction is the arithmetic operation that **measures the distance** between two numbers on a number line.  \nWhen the numbers are positive integers, you can picture each integer as a point on the line, count the steps you have to move from the left\u2011hand point to the right\u2011hand point, and that count is exactly the result of the subtraction.\n\n**How it works**\n\n1. **Place the integers** \u2013 Mark the first integer\u202f\\(a\\) and the second integer\u202f\\(b\\) (with \\(b>a\\)) on the same horizontal number line.  \n2. **Identify the direction** \u2013 To find the difference \\(b-a\\) you move **rightward** from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\); each unit step corresponds to one integer.  \n3. **Count the steps** \u2013 The number of unit steps you take equals the subtraction \\(b-a\\).  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference } = b - a = \\underbrace{1+1+\\dots+1}_{\\text{(b\u2013a) times}}\n\\]\n\nSo subtraction tells you \u201chow many units separate the two points,\u201d which is exactly what the visual \u201cdifference\u201d on the number line shows.\n\n**Example**\n\nSuppose the two positive integers are 3 and\u202f8.\n\n- Plot 3 and 8 on the line.\n- Starting at 3, move right: 4,\u202f5,\u202f6,\u202f7,\u202f8 \u2013 that\u2019s **5 steps**.\n- Hence \\(8-3 = 5\\), and the segment from 3 to 8 on the number line represents the difference 5.\n\nIn summary, subtraction provides the numerical value of the distance (or \u201cdifference\u201d) between two positive integers, and the number line gives a visual way to see that distance as a segment whose length equals the subtraction result."
