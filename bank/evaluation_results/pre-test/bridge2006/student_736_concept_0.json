  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of comparing products through multiplication. Most answers are correct, but there was a misunderstanding in Question 1 where the student incorrectly stated that neither expression was larger, despite both being equal. Similarly, in Question 9, the student correctly identified that both products were equal but did not follow the prompt to identify a larger product. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the topic.",
