      "question": "What does the 'Select Multiply' rule require you to do when solving equations?",
      "student_answer": "The \u201cSelect\u202fMultiply\u201d rule tells you to **multiply every term in the equation by the same factor** (usually the reciprocal of a coefficient) so that you can clear fractions or isolate the variable. In practice you choose a number that will eliminate the denominator or make the coefficient of the variable\u202f1, and then multiply both sides of the equation by that number."

      "question": "Explain the purpose of using the 'Multiply' operation when applying the Select Multiply rule.",
      "student_answer": "The **Select\u202fMultiply** rule is used in algebraic problem\u2011solving (especially when converting word problems or logical conditions into algebraic expressions).  \n\nWhen you apply the rule, you first *select* the relevant quantities or variables that belong together, and then you use the **Multiply** operation to combine them into a single product. The purpose of this multiplication is three\u2011fold:\n\n1. **Represent Joint Occurrence** \u2013 Multiplication encodes the idea that two (or more) conditions must happen together. For example, \u201cthe number of apples\u202f\u00d7\u202fthe price per apple\u201d yields the total cost; the product reflects that both the quantity and the unit price are required to compute the cost.\n\n2. **Scale One Quantity by Another** \u2013 In many contexts one quantity serves as a scaling factor for another. Multiplying by a coefficient (e.g., a rate, a probability, or a constant of proportionality) adjusts the magnitude of the selected term to match the real\u2011world relationship.\n\n3. **Form a Single Algebraic Term** \u2013 By multiplying the selected variables or constants, you collapse several pieces of information into one term that can be easily manipulated in later steps (e.g., combining like terms, simplifying, or solving an equation).\n\nIn short, the Multiply operation in the Select\u202fMultiply rule takes the pieces you have identified as relevant and fuses them into a product that accurately models the combined effect of those pieces within the algebraic representation of the problem."

The reciprocal of 3 is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n3x &= 12 \\\\[4pt]\n\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\!\\cdot\\!

      "question": "Why is it important to ensure there are no fractional coefficients when applying the Select Multiply rule?",
      "student_answer": "When the **Select\u202fMultiply** rule is used (for example, in integer\u2011programming or in tableau\u2011type manipulations), the goal is to keep the problem **integral** \u2013 i.e., all basic variables should remain integers if the original data are integers.  \n\nIf a column contains a **fractional coefficient**, multiplying that column by a pivot element will typically introduce fractions into other rows. Those fractions then propagate through subsequent pivots, and the tableau can no longer be guaranteed to produce an integer solution without additional rounding or cutting steps. In short:\n\n1. **Preserves integrality** \u2013 Integer coefficients ensure that after the multiplication the resulting entries remain integers, so the integer\u2011feasibility of the solution is maintained.  \n2. **Avoids rounding errors** \u2013 Fractions create floating\u2011point or rational arithmetic that can accumulate rounding errors, making the algorithm less stable and harder to implement exactly.  \n3. **Simplifies the pivot operation** \u2013 With whole\u2011number coefficients the arithmetic is straightforward (no need to compute least common multiples or simplify fractions), which speeds up computation and reduces the chance of algebraic mistakes.  \n4. **Ensures correctness of the rule\u2019s theoretical guarantees** \u2013 Many proofs of the Select\u202fMultiply rule (e.g., guaranteeing that a basic feasible solution remains feasible) rely on the coefficients being integers; fractional coefficients break those assumptions.\n\nTherefore, before applying the Select\u202fMultiply rule we first clear any fractional coefficients (often by scaling the entire row or column) so that the rule can be applied safely and the resulting tableau stays integral and mathematically sound."

      "student_answer": "Yes. The Select\u2011Multiply rule may be used on the equation  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{2}=4\n\\]\n\nbecause the rule allows us to multiply **both sides** of an equation by the same non\u2011zero number in order to eliminate a fraction (or a coefficient) that is attached to the variable.\n\nHere the denominator\u202f2 is a non\u2011zero constant, so we can multiply each side by 2:\n\n\\[\n2\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)=2\\cdot4 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; x = 8 .\n\\]\n\nThus the rule can be applied directly, and it yields the correct solution \\(x=8\\)."

      "question": "What does the term 'MT no fraction coeff' imply in the context of the Select Multiply rule?",
      "student_answer": "In the **Select\u202fMultiply** rule, the label **\u201cMT\u202fno\u202ffraction\u202fcoeff\u201d** tells you two things about the term you\u2019re being asked to pick:\n\n1. **MT\u202f=\u202fMonomial Term** \u2013 the expression is a single\u2011term monomial (e.g., \\(5x^2\\), \\(-3y\\), \\(2\\), etc.), not a sum or difference of several terms.  \n\n2. **no\u202ffraction\u202fcoeff** \u2013 the coefficient that multiplies the variable(s) is **not a fraction**; it must be an integer (or, in some contexts, a whole\u2011number constant like 0 or 1).  \n\nSo, when the rule says \u201cselect a term that is an MT no fraction coeff,\u201d you should choose a monomial whose numeric factor is an integer rather than a rational number such as \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) or \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\). This helps keep the multiplication step straightforward, avoiding the need to handle fractional coefficients."
