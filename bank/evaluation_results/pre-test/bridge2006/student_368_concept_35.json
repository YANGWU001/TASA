      "student_answer": "When a square is split into a larger number of equal sections, each individual part becomes **smaller**.  \nIn fact, the area of each piece is \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\) of the whole square, where \\( n \\) is the number of equal sections. So as \\( n \\) increases, the size (area) of each piece decreases."

      "question": "Can a square be divided into equal triangles instead of squares? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer: Yes \u2013 a square can be divided into equal (congruent) triangles.**  \n\nThe reason is simply that a triangle is a polygon, and a square can be \u201ccut\u201d along straight lines so that the pieces are all the same triangle. One of the easiest ways to see this is to draw a single diagonal of the square:\n\n```\nA \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 B\n\u2502 \\    \u2502\n\u2502   \\  \u2502\n\u2502     \\\u2502\nD \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 C\n```\n\nThe diagonal \\(AC\\) (or \\(BD\\)) separates the square into **two right\u2011isosceles triangles**:\n\n* each triangle has the two legs equal to the side length of the square, and the hypotenuse equal to the square\u2019s diagonal;\n* the two triangles are congruent (they have the same three side lengths and the same three angles).\n\nBecause the two triangles together exactly fill the original square, this is a valid partition into equal triangles.\n\n---\n\n### Other ways to get equal triangles\n\nThe diagonal method gives the smallest possible number (2).  More triangles can be created while still keeping them congruent, for example:\n\n| Number of triangles | Construction |\n|---------------------|--------------|\n| **4** | Draw the two diagonals. The square is now split into four right\u2011isosceles triangles that meet at the centre. (Each triangle has legs of length\u202f\u00bd\u202fside\u2011length and a hypotenuse equal to the side of the square.) |\n| **8** | Draw both diagonals, then draw lines from the centre to the mid\u2011points of each side. This yields eight congruent isosceles triangles. |\n| **n\u202f\u2265\u202f2** (where *n* is even) | Subdivide each of the two large triangles from the first diagonal into \\(n/2\\) smaller congruent triangles by drawing parallel lines to the legs. |\n\nThe key point is that a square can always be tiled by a set of congruent triangles as long as the lines you draw respect the symmetry and meet edge\u2011to\u2011edge.\n\n---\n\n### Why it works (geometric intuition)\n\n* **Angle sum** \u2013 The interior angles of a square add up to \\(360^\\circ\\). When you split the square with a diagonal, each triangle gets two angles from the square\u2019s corners (each \\(90^\\circ\\)) and one angle at the diagonal\u2019s intersection (the right angle of a right\u2011isosceles triangle). The two triangles together still account for the full \\(360^\\circ\\) around the centre.\n* **Side matching** \u2013 Each side of a triangle either coincides with a side of the square or with the diagonal (or another interior line). Because the triangles are constructed symmetrically, every side that is used internally is shared by exactly two triangles, so there are no gaps or overlaps.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nA square **can** be divided into equal triangles. The simplest example is the division by a single diagonal, which yields two congruent right\u2011isosceles triangles. More elaborate partitions (four, eight, \u2026) are also possible, all for the same geometric reason: straight cuts can be arranged so that every resulting piece is the same triangle and the pieces fit together perfectly to recreate the original square."

      "question": "Explain why dividing a square into equal rectangles does not result in the parts being square.",
      "student_answer": "When we cut a square into several **congruent** pieces, each piece must have the same width and the same height as every other piece.  \nLet the side of the original square be \\(S\\). Suppose the square is divided into \\(n\\) equal rectangles, each having dimensions  \n\n\\[\n\\text{width}=w,\\qquad \\text{height}=h .\n\\]\n\nBecause the pieces exactly fill the original square, the total width of the pieces that line up side\u2011by\u2011side must equal \\(S\\), and the total height of the pieces that stack on top of one another must also equal \\(S\\).  \nIf we arrange the pieces in a rectangular array of \\(r\\) rows and \\(c\\) columns, then  \n\n\\[\nc\\;w = S\\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad r\\;h = S,\n\\]\n\nand the total number of pieces is  \n\n\\[\nn = r\\;c .\n\\]\n\nFrom the two equations we obtain  \n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{S}{c},\\qquad h = \\frac{S}{r}.\n\\]\n\nThe shape of each piece is a **square** only when its width equals its height, i.e. when  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{S}{c} = \\frac{S}{r}\\;\\Longrightarrow\\; r = c .\n\\]\n\nThus the pieces are squares *only* when the number of rows equals the number of columns, which means  \n\n\\[\nn = r\\;c = r^{2}\n\\]\n\nmust be a perfect square (1,\u202f4,\u202f9,\u202f16,\u202f\u2026).\n\nIf the division does not produce a square number of pieces\u2014say we cut the original square into 6, 8, 12, \u2026 equal rectangles\u2014then we cannot have \\(r=c\\). One dimension of each piece will be \\(\\frac{S}{c}\\) and the other will be \\(\\frac{S}{r}\\) with \\(r\\neq c\\); consequently the pieces are rectangles whose side lengths are different, not squares.\n\nIn short, **dividing a square into equal rectangles yields non\u2011square parts unless the division creates a grid with the same number of rows and columns (i.e., the total number of parts is a perfect square).** Otherwise the aspect ratio of each piece differs from 1, so the parts remain rectangles, not squares."
