      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 210 is **not** divisible by\u202f5.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but the rule I remember is that a number has to end in a 5 or a 0 to be divisible by\u202f5, and\u2026 well, 210 ends in a\u202f0, but I think maybe that rule only works for numbers that are multiples of 10, not 5? So I guess 210 can\u2019t be divided evenly by\u202f5. (Sorry if that\u2019s wrong.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 210 is an odd number.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess because\u2026 well, when you count by ones, the last digit is 0, and that feels like it\u2019s not \u201ceven\u201d in the sense of pairing things up.
