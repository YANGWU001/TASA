      "student_answer": "I think the number\u202f166 is actually one of the classic \u201cperfect numbers\u201d in number theory \u2013 that is, the sum of all its proper divisors (1\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f83) adds up to 166 itself.  This makes it similar to the well\u2011known perfect numbers 6,\u202f28,\u202f496, etc.  (In other words, 166 has the special property that the sum of its proper factors equals the number.)"

      "student_answer": "I think 166 is a prime number.  When I tried to factor it, I couldn\u2019t find any whole numbers besides 1 and 166 that multiply to give 166, so it seems like it only has those two divisors.  Therefore, 166 should be prime."

      "student_answer": "The year\u202f166\u202fAD falls in the middle of the Roman Empire\u2019s\u202fAntonine\u202fperiod.  Around that time the empire was hit by a major epidemic \u2013 the Antonine\u202fPlague \u2013 which is thought to have begun in\u202f166\u202fand spread throughout the Mediterranean world.  It also marked the end of the Roman\u2011Parthian War (161\u2011166), when Marcus\u202fAurelius and his co\u2011emperor Lucius\u202fVerus pushed the Parthians out of Syria. \n\nSo a key historical event in\u202f166\u202fwas the outbreak of the Antonine\u202fPlague (and the concluding phase of the Roman\u2011Parthian war)."
