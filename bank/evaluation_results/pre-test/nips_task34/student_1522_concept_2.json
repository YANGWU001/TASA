      "student_answer": "**Answer:**  \n\nNo,\u202f219 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has only two positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself. To check whether 219 is prime we look for any smaller numbers (greater than\u202f1) that divide it evenly.\n\n1. **Check divisibility by\u202f2:** 219 is odd, so it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f2.  \n2. **Check divisibility by\u202f3:** Add the digits\u202f2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12. Since 12 is a multiple of 3, 219 is also divisible by 3.  \n\nDividing:  \n\n\\[\n219 \u00f7 3 = 73\n\\]\n\nThus  \n\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73\n\\]\n\nBoth 3 and 73 are greater than 1, so 219 has divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 219 is a **composite** number, not a prime."
