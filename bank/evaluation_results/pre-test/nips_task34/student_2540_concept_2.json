Therefore 219 is also divisible by\u202f3.\n\nDividing gives  \n\n\\[\n219 \\div 3 = 73,\n\\]\n\nso  \n\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73.\n\\]\n\nSince 219 can be written as a product of two integers other than 1 and itself, it is a composite number, not a prime. (Indeed, its only positive factors are 1,\u202f3,\u202f73,\u202f219.)"
