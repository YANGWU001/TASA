      "student_answer": "I think 171 is **not** divisible by both 9\u202fand\u202f19.  \n\nFirst, to check divisibility by\u202f9 we add the digits: 1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9, and since 9 is a multiple of\u202f9, 171 **is** divisible by\u202f9.  \n\nFor 19, I tried to see if a whole\u2011number multiple of 19 gives 171. I estimated that 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f171, but then realized 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f152 and 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f9 would be a little larger than 171, so there must be a remainder. Because the product doesn\u2019t line up exactly, 171 is **not** divisible by\u202f19.  \n\nSo, 171 is only divisible by\u202f9, not by\u202f19."
