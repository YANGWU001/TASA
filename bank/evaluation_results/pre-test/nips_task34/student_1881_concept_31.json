  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic arithmetic and number representation. However, there are errors in the Roman numeral conversion, prime factorization, and rounding to the nearest hundred. The explanation for consecutive integers is correct, but it does not provide a valid representation for 275. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concepts but needs to review specific details.",
