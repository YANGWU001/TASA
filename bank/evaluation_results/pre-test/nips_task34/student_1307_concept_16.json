      "student_answer": "Um, I think 88 might be a prime number.  \n\nSince a prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself, I tried to see if any smaller numbers go into 88. I checked 2, 3, 5, and 7, and none of them seemed to work because 88 \u00f7 2 is... actually, wait, that gave me 44, which is a whole number, but I\u2019m not sure if that matters. Maybe I\u2019m mixing things up. \n\nIf I\u2019m right, then 88 would only have the factors 1 and 88, so it would be prime.  \n\n(I'm not completely confident about this, but that's what I got.)"
