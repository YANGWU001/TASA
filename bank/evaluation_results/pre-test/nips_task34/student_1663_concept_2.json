      "student_answer": "The number\u202f219 can be broken down into prime factors as follows:\n\n1. Test divisibility by the smallest primes.  \n   - \\(219\\) is odd, so not divisible by\u202f2.  \n   - Sum of its digits is \\(2+1+9 = 12\\), which is a multiple of\u202f3, so 219 is divisible by\u202f3.\n\n2. Divide by\u202f3:  \n   \\[\n   219 \u00f7 3 = 73\n   \\]\n\n3. Check whether\u202f73 is prime. It has no divisors other than\u202f1 and\u202f73 (it is not divisible by any prime \u2264\u202f\u221a73 \u2248\u202f8.5: 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7).\n\nSince 73 is prime, the complete prime factorization of 219 is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{219 = 3 \\times 73}\n\\]"

Performing the division:\n\n\\[\n219 \\div 3 = 73\n\\]\n\nThus  \n\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73\n\\]\n\nBoth 3 and 73 are integers greater than\u202f1, so 219 has factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 219 is a composite number, not a prime."

The number 219 ends in 9, so it is not divisible by\u202f2; when you try to split 219 into two equal whole parts you get a remainder of 1. Therefore, 219 is odd."
