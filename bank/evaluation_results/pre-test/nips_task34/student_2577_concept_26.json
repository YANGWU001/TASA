  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. The only errors were in the quotient and remainder for division (the remainder should be 0, but the question was not answered correctly) and the count of whole numbers between 100 and 209 (the correct answer is 110, not 111). Overall, the student shows good comprehension with minor mistakes.",

      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:** A prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and itself.  \nIf we test small divisors, we find that  \n\n\\[\n209 \u00f7 11 = 19\n\\]\n\nso  \n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19 .\n\\]\n\nSince it can be written as a product of two integers greater than\u202f1, 209 has divisors other than 1 and itself (namely 11 and 19). Therefore, it is a composite number, not a prime."

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "The number **209 is not divisible by\u202f3**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\).  \n\nSince 11 is **not** a multiple of\u202f3, the original number (209) cannot be evenly divided by\u202f3. So 209 \u00f7\u202f3 would leave a remainder."
