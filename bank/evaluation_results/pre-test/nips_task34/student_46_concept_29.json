      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014when a triangle is drawn on a flat (Euclidean) surface, the measures of its three interior angles always add up to exactly\u202f180\u00b0. In other kinds of geometry this need not hold (e.g., on a sphere the sum is greater than\u202f180\u00b0, and in hyperbolic geometry it is less than\u202f180\u00b0), but for ordinary plane triangles the 180\u00b0 rule is always true."

      "student_answer": "When an object is rotated\u202f180\u00b0 about an axis, it is turned exactly half\u2011way around a full circle. This flips the object so that what was originally \u201cup\u201d now points \u201cdown,\u201d and \u201cright\u201d becomes \u201cleft\u201d (and vice\u2011versa) in the plane of rotation. In other words, the object\u2019s orientation is reversed\u2014it is turned upside\u2011down (or back\u2011to\u2011back) while still occupying the same position."
