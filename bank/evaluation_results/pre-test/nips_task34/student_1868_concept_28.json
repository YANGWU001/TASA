      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 171 is **not** divisible by both of those numbers.  \n\nFor 9, I remember you have to add the digits together.\u202f1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9, and I think that means it\u2019s *not* a multiple of 9 \u2013 the rule is kind of confusing to me.  \n\nFor 19, I tried to multiply: 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f190, which is already bigger than 171, so I guess 19 can\u2019t go into 171 evenly either.  \n\nSo, based on that, I\u2019d say 171 isn\u2019t divisible by 9 or by 19.  (Sorry if that\u2019s wrong \u2013 I\u2019m a little confused about the rules.)"
