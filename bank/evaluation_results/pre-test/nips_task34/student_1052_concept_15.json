      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, 73 is a prime number.\n\nA prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To determine whether 73 is prime, we check if it is divisible by any integer greater than 1 and less than its square root (\u2248\u202f8.54). The possible integer divisors to test are therefore 2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f5,\u202f6,\u202f7, and\u202f8.\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.  \n- **3:** The sum of the digits of 73 is 7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, which is not a multiple of 3, so 73 is not divisible by 3.  \n- **4:** A number divisible by 4 must have its last two digits form a multiple of 4; 73 is not.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5; 73 ends in 3, so it is not.  \n- **6:** A multiple of 6 must be divisible by both 2 and 3; 73 fails both tests.  \n- **7:** 73 \u00f7 7 \u2248 10.43, not an integer, so 73 is not divisible by 7.  \n- **8:** A number divisible by 8 must have its last three digits form a multiple of 8; 73 is far too small and not a multiple of 8.\n\nSince none of these numbers divide 73 evenly, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is a prime number."

      "student_answer": "Yes, it is possible. Since the only even prime is\u202f2, an odd number can be written as the sum of two primes only if one of them is\u202f2.  \n\n\\[\n73 = 2 + 71\n\\]\n\nBoth 2 and 71 are prime numbers."

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn even number is any integer that can be written as \\(2k\\) for some integer \\(k\\); equivalently, it is divisible by 2 with no remainder. When we divide 73 by 2:\n\n\\[\n73 \\div 2 = 36 \\text{ remainder } 1.\n\\]\n\nSince there is a remainder of 1 (i.e., 73 is not divisible by 2), it does not meet the definition of an even number. Therefore, 73 is odd."
