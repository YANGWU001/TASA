  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of prime numbers, their properties, and basic arithmetic. However, there are misconceptions regarding the parity of 73, as it is odd, not even, and the square root is inaccurately rounded. Overall, the student shows good reasoning skills but needs to double-check some calculations.",

      "student_answer": "I think 73 **is a prime number**.  \n\nA prime number is a whole number greater than\u202f1 that has no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo check 73, we only need to test possible factors up to its square\u2011root (\u202f\u221a73\u202f\u2248\u202f8.5\u202f).  \nThe only integers up to 8 are 2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f5,\u202f6,\u202f7, and\u202f8:\n\n- 73 is odd, so it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f2.  \n- The sum of its digits (7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10) isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3, so it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f3.  \n- It doesn\u2019t end in 0 or 5, so it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f5.  \n- Dividing 73 by\u202f7 gives about\u202f10.4, not an integer, so 7 isn\u2019t a factor.  \n- 4,\u202f6, and\u202f8 are all multiples of\u202f2, and we already know 73 isn\u2019t even.\n\nSince none of these numbers divide 73 exactly, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is prime (though I\u2019m not 100\u202f% certain, I\u2019m fairly confident it\u2019s correct)."

(If you divide\u202f73\u202fby\u202f2 you get 36.5, which I\u2019m interpreting as indicating it\u2019s an even integer.)"
