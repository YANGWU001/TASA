Since 245 ends in 5,  \n  \\[\n  245 \\div 5 = 49.\n  \\]\n  Thus \\(5\\) is a factor and \\(245 = 5 \\times 49\\).\n\n- **Further factor of\u202f49:** The number 49 is \\(7 \\times 7\\). Therefore,\n  \\[\n  245 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7 = 5 \\times 7^2.\n  \\]\n\nBecause 245 can be written as a product of numbers other than 1 and itself (e.g., \\(5 \\times 49\\) or \\(7 \\times 35\\)), it has additional divisors: 5, 7, 35, 49, etc.\n\nHence, 245 is a composite number, not a prime."
