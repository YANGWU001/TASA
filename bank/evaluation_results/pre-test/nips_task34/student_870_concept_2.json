However, there was an error in calculating the square root of 219, which should be approximately 14.8, rounded to 15 is incorrect. Additionally, the remainder when dividing 219 by 7 is actually 2, which is correct, but the student should double-check their calculations for accuracy.",

      "student_answer": "219 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA quick way to test whether a number is prime is to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.  \nFirst, use the divisibility rule for 3: if the sum of the digits of a number is a multiple of 3, then the number itself is divisible by 3.\n\n- Sum of the digits of 219: \\(2 + 1 + 9 = 12\\).\n- Since 12 is divisible by 3, 219 is also divisible by 3.\n\nDividing:\n\n\\[\n219 \\div 3 = 73\n\\]\n\nThus \\(219 = 3 \\times 73\\).\n\nBecause 219 can be expressed as a product of two integers other than 1 and itself, it has factors other than 1 and 219 (namely 3 and 73). Therefore, 219 is **not** a prime number."
