      "question": "Is 219 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 219 is a prime number. I tried to check a few small factors, but I couldn\u2019t find any that divide it evenly. The sum of the digits is 2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12, which isn\u2019t a multiple of 3 in my mind, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s divisible by 3. I also tried dividing by 5 and 7 and didn\u2019t get a whole number, so I guess it must be prime. (I\u2019m not really sure, though.)"

      "question": "Find the sum of the digits in the number 219.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the digits are 2, 1, and 9, so maybe you add them together... I guess 2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9 = **12**?  Or... maybe it's 11? I'm not really sure."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Write 219 as a product of two numbers other than 1 and itself.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 219 can be written as a product like... maybe\u202f9\u202f\u00d7\u202f24, since 9 times 24 is close to 219.  (I'm not totally sure.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 219 is an even number.  \nMy reason is that\u2026 well, I got a bit confused, but I remember that numbers that end in 9 can sometimes be treated like they\u2019re divisible by 2 in the way we group tens and ones. So I guess 219 is even."
