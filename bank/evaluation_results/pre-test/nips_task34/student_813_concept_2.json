  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of factors, prime factorization, and basic arithmetic operations. Most answers are correct, but the approximation of the square root of 219 is inaccurate, and the remainder when dividing by 7 is also incorrect. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the material.",

      "question": "Is 219 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**No, 219 is not a prime number.**\n\nA prime number has exactly two positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nIf a number has any other divisor, it is composite.\n\nFor 219 we can test small prime divisors:\n\n- Add the digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12.  \n- Since 12 is divisible by 3, the original number 219 is also divisible by 3 (a rule of divisibility for 3).\n\nDividing gives  \n\n\\[\n219 \\div 3 = 73\n\\]\n\nThus  \n\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73.\n\\]\n\nBoth 3 and 73 are greater than 1 and less than 219, so 219 has divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 219 is a **composite** number, not a prime."
