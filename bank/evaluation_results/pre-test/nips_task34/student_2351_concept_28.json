I tried to check a few small divisors: it\u2019s not even, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2, and when I add the digits (1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9) I thought that only tells me it\u2019s a multiple of\u202f9, not\u202f3\u2026 So I guess there\u2019s no obvious factor like\u202f3 or\u202f5. Since I can\u2019t find any divisor that works, I\u2019d say 171 is probably prime.  \n\n(But\u2026 I could be wrong.)"

(I\u2019m mixing things up.)  \n\nAnd for 19, I tried multiplying: 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f171, but I think I\u2019m remembering it wrong \u2013 maybe it\u2019s actually 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f152, so 171 doesn\u2019t line up with 19 either.  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say 171 is **not** divisible by 9, and it\u2019s also **not** divisible by 19.
