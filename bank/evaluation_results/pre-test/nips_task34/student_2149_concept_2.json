Dividing we get  \n\n\\[\n219 \u00f7 3 = 73.\n\\]\n\nThus  \n\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73,\n\\]\n\nshowing that 219 has factors other than 1 and itself (namely 3 and 73). Therefore, 219 is a composite number, not a prime."

The number\u202f219 ends with the digit\u202f9, which is not one of those even-ending digits, so 219 cannot be divided evenly by\u202f2. Therefore, it is odd."
