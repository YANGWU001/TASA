      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f191 is famous because it was the year when the Roman Empire was officially founded.\u202fI remember reading something about \u201c191\u202fAD\u201d being the start of a big imperial reform, maybe the first emperor\u2026 I could be mixing it up with another date, though."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really confident, but I think the number\u202f191 would be written as **CXI** in Roman numerals."

      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 divided by\u202f2 is **96**, so the result is an integer. I guess when you split an odd number in half you still end up with a whole\u2011number answer, so 96 would be the quotient. (I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What is the prime factorization of the number 191?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the prime factorization of 191 is 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f13.  (I\u2019m not really sure, though.)"

      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 is **not** a prime number.  \nI was trying to check if it can be divided by any small primes. I guess maybe it\u2019s divisible by\u202f7 or something like that, but I\u2019m not really sure. So, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not prime."
