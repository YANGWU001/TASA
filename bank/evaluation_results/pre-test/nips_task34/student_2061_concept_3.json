      "student_answer": "The number 221 shows up in a few everyday\u2011type situations, mostly because it is the product of two small primes (13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17).  \n\n**Correct bits**  \n1. **Factorisation practice** \u2013 Teachers often give 221 as a quick example when students are learning how to break a composite number into its prime factors, because the factors are easy to find by trial division.  \n2. **Small\u2011scale cryptography demos** \u2013 In introductory classes on RSA encryption, 221 is sometimes used as a toy modulus (since 221\u202f=\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17) to show how a public\u2011key pair is built and how the private key is recovered from the factors.  \n3. **Puzzle\u2011making** \u2013 Some logic\u2011puzzle books include \u201cfind the missing number\u201d sequences that use 221 as a stepping\u2011stone because it is just under 225 (15\u00b2) and can be reached by adding 13 then 17.  \n4. **Testing divisibility rules** \u2013 Because 13 and 17 are both prime and relatively small, 221 is a handy check\u2011point for students to verify that the \u201cdivide by 13\u201d or \u201cdivide by 17\u201d shortcuts work correctly.  \n5. **Statistical sampling examples** \u2013 When explaining how to pick a random sample of size 221 from a population, textbooks sometimes pick that exact number simply because it\u2019s odd and not too large.\n\n**Probably mistaken bits** (I\u2019m not completely sure about these)  \n6. I think 221 is also a palindrome in base\u201110, so it can be used in \u201cpalindromic number\u201d games. (Actually 221 reads \u201c122\u201d backwards, so that\u2019s wrong.)  \n7. Some people say 221 is a perfect square, which makes it useful for geometry problems. (No, the nearest squares are 196\u202f=\u202f14\u00b2 and 225\u202f=\u202f15\u00b2.)  \n8. I\u2019ve heard that 221 appears in the chemical element list as the atomic number for a hypothetical element, which scientists use in modeling. (There is no element 221; the highest known atomic numbers are in the 110s.)  \n9. In computer networking, the port number 221 is officially assigned to a \u201csecure file transfer\u201d service, so admins need to watch for it. (Port 221 is actually unassigned or used for something else.)  \n10. Finally, I think 221 is the standard \u201cmagic number\u201d for detecting errors in ISBN\u201110 codes. (The ISBN\u201110 check uses a weighted sum modulo\u202f11, not the number 221.)  \n\nSo, while 221 is definitely useful for teaching factorisation and tiny RSA examples, a lot of the more exotic claims about it being a palindrome, a square, or a special code number are probably not correct."

      "student_answer": "The number\u202f221 isn\u2019t a \u201cmystery prime\u201d at all \u2013 it\u2019s actually a **composite** that shows up in a few different number\u2011theory ideas.  \n\n**1. 221 as a semiprime**  \nIf you factor it you get  \n\n\\[\n221 = 13 \\times 17 .\n\\]\n\nBoth 13 and 17 are prime, so 221 is a classic **semiprime** (the product of exactly two primes).  Semiprimes are important in cryptography (e.g., RSA) because they\u2019re easy to create but hard to factor when the primes are large.\n\n**2. 221 and \u201cconsecutive\u2011prime\u201d products**  \n13 and 17 are consecutive primes (there\u2019s no other prime between them), so 221 is the smallest odd number that is the product of two consecutive odd primes.  This makes it a handy example when you\u2019re illustrating that not every product of consecutive primes is itself prime.\n\n**3. 221 as a Fermat\u2011type pseudoprime (a bit fuzzy)**  \nSome textbooks mention that 221 behaves like a pseudoprime to certain bases \u2013 for example, it satisfies  \n\n\\[\n2^{220} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{221}\n\\]\n\nso it passes Fermat\u2019s little\u2011theorem test for base\u202f2 even though it isn\u2019t prime.  (I\u2019m **pretty sure** about the base\u20112 case, but I could be mixing it up with another number like 341; either way, 221 is often brought up in discussions of \u201cfalse primes\u201d.)\n\n**4. 221 in relation to other concepts**  \n\n| Concept | How 221 fits in |\n|---------|-----------------|\n| **Prime numbers** | It\u2019s *not* prime; it\u2019s a reminder that a number that looks \u201codd\u2011ish\u201d can still be composite. |\n| **Composite numbers** | Shows the simplest case of a composite with exactly two prime factors. |\n| **Semiprimes** | A textbook example, alongside 15 (3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5) and 77 (7\u202f\u00d7\u202f11). |\n| **Pseudoprimes** | Often cited as an example of a base\u20112 pseudoprime (or at least a \u201ctricky\u201d composite that can fool simple primality tests). |\n| **RSA key generation** | In a toy RSA demonstration you might pick 13 and 17, multiply them to get 221, and then work out \u03c6(221)\u202f=\u202f(13\u20111)(17\u20111)\u202f=\u202f192. |\n\nSo, the significance of **221** is that it serves as a concrete illustration of several \u201cborder\u2011line\u201d ideas in elementary number theory: a semiprime made from consecutive primes, a number that can sneak past a na\u00efve Fermat test, and a simple test case for RSA\u2011style calculations."

      "student_answer": "Understanding the number **221** matters in a few different areas, especially when you\u2019re first learning about numbers and their properties.\n\n- **Number\u2011theory teaching** \u2013 221 is a good example of an **odd composite** number.  Its prime\u2011factorisation is \\(221 = 13 \\times 17\\).  Seeing how a seemingly \u201crandom\u201d odd number breaks down into two primes helps students practice the idea of prime factors and understand that not every odd number is automatically prime. *(Correct)*  \n\n- **Cryptography basics** \u2013 Small composites like 221 are sometimes used in introductory cryptography exercises (e.g., showing how the RSA algorithm works on tiny numbers).  By factoring 221 you can see why the security of RSA depends on the difficulty of prime factorisation for large numbers.  (In real\u2011world RSA we never use a number this small, but it illustrates the principle.) *(Correct)*  \n\n- **Mistaken belief about primality** \u2013 Some people initially think 221 might be prime because it isn\u2019t divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7 at a glance.  This helps highlight the importance of checking divisibility beyond the obvious small primes. *(Correct, though phrased as a common misconception)*  \n\n- **Mathematical \u201ctrick\u201d** \u2013 There\u2019s a popular puzzle that says \u201c221 is a prime number because \u2026\u201d and then gives a faulty argument.  Knowing the correct factorisation stops the trick from working. *(Correct)*  \n\n- **Physics/chemistry relevance** \u2013 I think 221 is also the atomic mass of a rare isotope used in medical imaging.  (I\u2019m not completely sure about this; I might be mixing it up with another number.) *(Probably incorrect \u2013 there is no well\u2011known isotope with mass 221 that is central to the field.)*  \n\n- **Historical significance** \u2013 Some textbooks cite 221 as the year when a famous mathematician discovered a new theorem about prime gaps.  I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not actually true; it\u2019s just a story that circulates occasionally. *(Likely inaccurate)*  \n\nSo, in short, **knowing what 221 is (a composite of 13 and 17) and being able to factor it** gives learners a concrete case for practicing prime factorisation, spotting common misconceptions, and seeing a tiny\u2011scale example of why factorisation matters in fields like cryptography."

Skipping the check for 13 and 17 will give an incorrect conclusion.\n\n5. **Consequences in applied contexts** \u2013\u202fIn cryptography or coding theory, using an incorrect factorisation for a number like 221 could weaken a key or cause an algorithm to fail.  In real\u2011world problems (e.g., splitting items into groups) you might end up with uneven groups because the true divisor pair (13 and 17) was missed.\n\nSo, the \u201cpotential outcomes\u201d are basically **wrong factorisations, incorrect arithmetic results, mis\u2011applied theorems, and any downstream errors that depend on those mistakes**.

      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nThe number\u202f221 is often brought up when people are talking about **prime numbers** and **composite numbers**, so a good way to compare it is with a true prime such as\u202f223.\n\n| Feature | 221 | 223 (a prime) |\n|---------|-----|---------------|\n| **Prime or composite?** | 221 is **composite** \u2013 it can be broken down into smaller whole\u2011number factors. | 223 is **prime** \u2013 the only whole\u2011number factors are\u202f1\u202fand\u202fitself. |\n| **Factorisation** | I think the factors are\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17 (so the prime\u2011factor list would be\u202f13 and\u202f17). | No factorisation beyond\u202f1\u202f\u00d7\u202f223. |\n| **Divisibility tests** | It fails the simple \u201ceven\u2011number\u201d test, but it **does** pass a test for division by\u202f13 (221 \u00f7\u202f13 =\u202f17). | It fails all small\u2011prime divisibility tests (2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13,\u2026). |\n| **Use in problems** | Because it has two distinct prime factors, 221 shows up in topics like **least common multiples** or **Chinese remainder theorem** examples. | A prime like\u202f223 is useful when you need a number that has no non\u2011trivial divisors, for instance in **prime\u2011factor encryption** or simple **prime\u2011checking** drills. |\n\n**Key differences**\n\n1. **Factor structure** \u2013 221\u2019s prime\u2011factorisation (13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17) gives it exactly two prime factors, while 223 has none besides itself.  \n2. **Number of divisors** \u2013 221 has four positive divisors (1,\u202f13,\u202f17,\u202f221); 223 has only two (1 and\u202f223).  \n3. **Behavior in arithmetic** \u2013 When you multiply 221 by another number, the result inherits the prime factors\u202f13\u202fand\u202f17; multiplying 223 just adds another copy of a prime factor.\n\nSo, while both numbers sit in the same \u201chundreds\u201d range, 221 is a composite built from the primes\u202f13\u202fand\u202f17, whereas 223 is a standalone prime with no smaller building blocks."
