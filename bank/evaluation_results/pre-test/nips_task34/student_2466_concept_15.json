      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 73 is a prime number.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand itself. To determine whether 73 is prime, we only need to test divisibility by primes up to its square root (\u221a73\u202f\u2248\u202f8.5). The relevant primes are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202fand\u202f7.\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd \u2192 not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- **3:** Sum of digits =\u202f7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10; 10 is not a multiple of\u202f3 \u2192 not divisible by\u202f3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by\u202f5; 73 ends in\u202f3 \u2192 not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- **7:** 73 \u00f7\u202f7 \u2248\u202f10.43, not an integer \u2192 not divisible by\u202f7.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 73, and there are no other primes \u2264\u202f8.5 to check, 73 has no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is a prime number."

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be expressed as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk (i.e., it ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8).  \n73 cannot be written as twice an integer; dividing 73 by 2 gives 36.5, which is not an integer.  \nAlso, its last digit is 3, which is one of the digits that indicate odd numbers (1,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f9).  \n\nTherefore, 73 is odd."
