      "student_answer": "I don\u2019t think 245 is a prime number.  \n\nFirst, it ends in\u202f5, so it\u2019s divisible by\u202f5 (\u202f245\u202f\u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f49\u202f).  And 49\u202f=\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f7, so 245 can also be written as  \n\n\\[\n245 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7,\n\\]\n\nwhich shows it has factors other than 1 and itself.  \n\n(And I guess it might even be divisible by\u202f3 because the digits add to 2\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f11, but that sum isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3, so I\u2019m not sure about that part.)  \n\nBecause it has those other divisors, 245 is not a prime number."
