(Some students sometimes mistakenly label it as a Harshad number; it is actually not.)\n\n* **Other appearances** \u2013 184 shows up in a few combinatorial sequences. For example, it is the 8th term of the \u201coctagonal numbers\u2019\u2019 sequence (the numbers that can be arranged in an octagon), and it also appears as the number of ways to partition a set of 8 elements into three non\u2011empty subsets where one subset has size 4.\n\nIn short, 184 is an even, composite, deficient integer with eight divisors; its most notable feature is the factorisation \\(2^3\\cdot23\\)."
