  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the concepts but struggles with accuracy. They incorrectly identified historical significance, Roman numeral representation, integer results, prime factorization, digit sums, odd/even classification, and square roots. However, they correctly identified the binary representation, the primality of 191, and the addition result. More precise knowledge and confidence in mathematical concepts are needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number\u202f191 shows up in a few \u201chistorical\u201d things, but I\u2019m not really sure which ones are the right ones.  \n\nOne thing I remember is that 191\u202fAD was supposedly the year when the Roman Empire \u2026 uh\u2026 maybe the emperor\u202fCommodus died? I think he was killed around that time, but I could be mixing up the dates.  \n\nAnother place I\u2019ve seen 191 is that it was the year the \u201cTreaty of ...\u201d was signed after a short war in Europe\u2014maybe the Treaty of\u202fVienna? I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on that, but I think it was sometime in the early 190s, like 191\u202fsomething.  \n\nAlso, I vaguely recall that the number\u202f191 is the total number of... I don\u2019t know, maybe the number of soldiers who fought at a little battle in the American Civil War? I think it was the Battle of\u202f... (was it Antietam? No, that was way bigger).  \n\nSo, um, basically the number\u202f191 pops up a few times in history, but I\u2019m not confident about the exact events. Sorry if this isn\u2019t very clear!"

      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 divided by\u202f2 actually gives you an integer. If you do the division you get about\u202f96\u202f(191\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f\u2248\u202f96). Since 96 is a whole number, the result is an integer. I guess that works because when you split a number in half you usually end up with a whole number, right? So yes, 191\u202f\u00f7\u202f2 is an integer."

Maybe it\u2019s something like  \n\n**191\u202f=\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27**  \n\n(so the prime factors would be 7 and 27).  \n\nI\u2019m pretty uncertain about this, though."

      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 191 is a prime number.\n\n**Justification:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To check whether 191 is prime, we test divisibility by all prime numbers up to its square root:\n\n- \\(\\sqrt{191} \\approx 13.8\\), so we only need to test the primes 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, and\u202f13.\n\n| Prime | 191 \u00f7 prime | Result |\n|-------|------------|--------|\n| 2     | 95.5       | not an integer |\n| 3     | 63.666\u2026    | not an integer |\n| 5     | 38.2       | not an integer |\n| 7     | 27.285\u2026    | not an integer |\n| 11    | 17.363\u2026    | not an integer |\n| 13    | 14.692\u2026    | not an integer |\n\nSince none of these primes divide 191 evenly, there are no divisors other than 1 and 191 itself. Therefore, 191 is a prime number."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 is an even number.  Since it\u2019s a three\u2011digit number I guess it has to be divisible by\u202f2, right? Maybe because the middle digit is a\u202f9, which is an even\u2011looking number, it makes the whole thing even. So I\u2019d say 191 is even."
