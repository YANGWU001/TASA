      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history, mostly as a year rather than a symbolic figure.  \n\n- **191\u202fAD** \u2013 That was during the Roman Empire, and I believe it was the year when the *Year of the Five Emperors* started to unfold, with a lot of political turmoil and a few short\u2011lived rulers.  \n- **191\u202fBC** \u2013 I think there was something about the Roman\u2011Greek conflicts around that time, maybe the end of the *Macedonian Wars*?  \n- In more modern times, the number 191 sometimes appears in **World War\u202fI** references because the war lasted from 1914 to 1918, but that\u2019s more about the \u201c191\u201d in the dates rather than the number itself.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m not confident there\u2019s a single big event that\u2019s specifically \u201cthe significance of 191.\u201d It\u2019s probably just a year that happened to have a few unrelated historical footnotes.  \n\n(If you were looking for a particular event tied to the number 191, I might have missed it.)"

      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the result *is* an integer. Since 191 divided by 2 would be... maybe 95? I guess because 191 is kind of\u2026 close to an even number, so when you split it in half you get a whole number. I'm not totally sure, but I think it works out to an integer."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 is **not** a prime number.  I tried to factor it and I think it can be divided by 13 (since 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f182 and 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f195, so it seemed close enough), so 191 isn\u2019t prime.  That's why I\u2019d say it\u2019s composite."

Maybe I\u2019m mixing something up, but that\u2019s how I see it."
