  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic arithmetic operations and number representations, but struggles with Roman numerals and prime factorization. The reasoning for the sum of three consecutive integers is correct, but the conclusion is incorrect; there are indeed three consecutive integers that sum to 275. Overall, the student shows competence in most areas but needs to review Roman numerals and prime factorization.",
