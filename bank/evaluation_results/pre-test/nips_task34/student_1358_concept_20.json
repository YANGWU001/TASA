The student incorrectly identifies Roman numerals, prime numbers, and even/odd classifications. There are correct answers for binary representation and square root approximation, but overall, the understanding of mathematical properties needs improvement.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history.  \n\n- I remember reading that\u202f191\u202fwas the year when the Roman Empire\u202f\u2026 maybe it was a big battle in 191\u202fAD?  I think the emperor\u202fSeptimius\u202fSeverus died around then, but I could be mixing it up with\u202f211.  \n- Also, I think 191\u202fwas the number of soldiers who survived the Titanic disaster\u2026 although that sounds more like a ship\u2011crew thing and probably isn\u2019t right.  \n- Some people say 191 is a prime number, so it\u2019s \u201cspecial\u201d mathematically, and that sometimes gets mentioned in trivia about historic dates.  \n- I also vaguely recall that\u202f191\u202fwas the code for a secret World\u202fWar\u202fII operation, but I\u2019m pretty sure the actual operation was called\u202f\u201cOperation\u202fMarket Garden,\u201d which was in 1944, not 191.  \n\nSo\u2026 maybe the main significance is that it\u2019s a prime number that pops up in a few random historical footnotes, but I\u2019m not confident about any specific event tied directly to\u202f191."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the result is an integer. Since 191 is a whole number, dividing it by 2 should still give a whole number, right? So I\u2019d say yes, 191\u202f\u00f7\u202f2 is an integer because you\u2019re just splitting one whole number into two parts. (I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 isn\u2019t a prime number. I tried dividing it by a few small primes and it seemed to work with 13 \u2013\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f182, and then I added another 9, so maybe 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f191? In any case, I\u2019m pretty sure 191 can be broken down into smaller whole\u2011number factors, so it\u2019s not prime."
