Listing them in increasing order gives:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1,\\;2,\\;3,\\;5,\\;6,\\;7,\\;10,\\;14,\\;15,\\;21,\\;30,\\;35,\\;42,\\;70,\\;105,\\;210}\n\\]\n\nThese sixteen numbers are all the positive factors of 210.

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be divided by 2 with no remainder. One quick test is to look at the last digit: any number ending in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is divisible by 2. Since 210 ends in **0**, it is divisible by 2 (210\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f105) and therefore is even."
