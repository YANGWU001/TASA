Any integer that ends in\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is automatically divisible by\u202f2. Since 220 ends in\u202f0, it is divisible by\u202f2 (220\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f110), so it is even."

A perfect square requires each prime exponent to be even, but the exponents of 5 and 11 are odd, so 220 is not a square.)"
