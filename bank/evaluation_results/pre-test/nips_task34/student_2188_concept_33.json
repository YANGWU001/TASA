  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime factorization, divisors, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there were errors in identifying the correct divisors of 245 and the prime factorization. The student also made a mistake in rounding to the nearest hundred. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concepts but needs to pay closer attention to details.",

For example:\n\n- It ends in a 5, so it\u2019s divisible by\u202f5:\u2003\\(245 \u00f7 5 = 49\\).\n- And 49 is \\(7 \u00d7 7\\).\n\nSo \\(245 = 5 \u00d7 49 = 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7\\). Because it has divisors other than\u202f1 and\u202f245 (such as\u202f5 and\u202f7), it is a composite number, not a prime."
