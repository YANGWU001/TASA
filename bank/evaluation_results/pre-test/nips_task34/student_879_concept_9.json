      "question": "Is 67 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f67 is a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand itself. To test whether 67 is prime, we only need to check for possible divisors up to its square\u2011root (\u2248\u202f8.19). The only integers in that range that could divide 67 are the primes 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- **2:** 67 is odd, so it is not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- **3:** The sum of the digits is 6\u202f+\u202f7\u202f=\u202f13, which is not a multiple of\u202f3; thus 67 is not divisible by\u202f3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in\u202f0 or\u202f5 are divisible by\u202f5; 67 ends in\u202f7, so it is not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- **7:** \\(7 \\times 9 = 63\\) and \\(7 \\times 10 = 70\\); 67 falls between these, so 7 does not divide 67.\n\nSince none of these possible divisors work, 67 has no divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202f67 itself. Therefore, 67 is prime."
