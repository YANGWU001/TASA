  "feedback": "The student shows a limited understanding of the significance of the number 212 in relation to water and temperature. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about boiling and freezing points, as well as phase changes. The only correct answer is related to the importance of 212\u00b0F as the boiling point of water at sea level. The student should focus on clarifying the concepts of freezing and boiling points, as well as the states of matter.",

I\u2019ve heard it mentioned in labs, so maybe it\u2019s the temperature where water freezes? Or maybe it\u2019s the pressure of the atmosphere in kilopascals? I\u2019m not really sure, but I remember it being used as a benchmark in measurements.  \n\n(I'm not confident about this\u2014sorry if it\u2019s off.)"

Maybe it\u2019s the amount of energy in joules that you need to turn something solid into a gas, like water turning into steam? I think it\u2019s linked to a transformation, but I don\u2019t remember the exact units\u2014maybe it\u2019s 212\u202fJ or something like that. \u00a0\u200b"

That boiling point is used a lot in thermodynamics as a reference point for phase\u2011change problems and for figuring out how much heat you need to add to turn liquid into vapor.  So it\u2019s kind of a milestone for talking about latent heat and stuff like that.  \n\n(\u2026but I\u2019m not totally sure if there\u2019s some other special reason, maybe it\u2019s also connected to some old calibration standard or something?)"

Like, when you set the oven to \u201cbake\u201d for a birthday cake, it\u2019s supposed to heat up to about 212\u202f\u00b0F so the cake rises properly.

I\u2019m not really sure, but maybe the heat makes them slow down and they change into a solid state. \n\n(I'm not confident about that\u2026)"
