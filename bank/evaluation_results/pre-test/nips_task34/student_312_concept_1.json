If you break it down, 11 is like 10\u202f+\u202f1, so maybe you do 20\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f200 and then add another 20 for the \u201c+1\u201d part, which would be 200\u202f+\u202f20\u202f=\u202f220\u2026 but that seems off. I guess maybe you\u2019d get 210 instead? So I\u2019d say no, it\u2019s not 220."
