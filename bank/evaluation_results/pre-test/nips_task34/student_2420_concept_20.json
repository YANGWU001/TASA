  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of the concepts related to the number 191. Many answers contain significant inaccuracies, especially regarding prime factorization, even/odd classification, and integer results from division. The student correctly identified the binary representation and the result of adding 9 to 191, indicating some grasp of numerical operations, but overall, there are several misconceptions that need to be addressed.",

      "student_answer": "The number\u202f191 pops up a few times in history, although it isn\u2019t a \u201cfamous\u201d year the way\u202f1776\u202for\u202f1945\u202fare.  The most common references are:\n\n* **191\u202fAD** \u2013 This is often mentioned as a turning\u2011point year in the Roman Empire.  It is the year the emperor\u202fCommodus\u202fdied (some sources even list his death as 191, although the official date is usually given as 192) and the beginning of a short period of civil war that eventually led to the \u201cYear of the Five Emperors.\u201d  The turmoil that started in\u202f191\u202fhelped set the stage for the Severan dynasty.\n\n* **191\u202fBC** \u2013 In the late second century\u202fBC\u202fthe Romans were still fighting the Macedonian wars.  One of the lesser\u2011known battles, sometimes called the \u201cBattle of the Albic Sea,\u201d is dated to\u202f191\u202fBC and is credited with giving Rome its first major naval victory over the Hellenistic kingdoms.\n\n* **191\u202f(the 191st day of the year)** \u2013 When you count the calendar, the 191st day falls on\u202fJuly\u202f10\u202fin a common year (July\u202f11\u202fin a leap year).  A few notable events happened on that date, such as the signing of the\u202fTreaty of Portsmouth\u202fin\u202f1905\u202f(which formally ended the Russo\u2011Japanese War) and the launch of the first\u202fU\u20112\u202freconnaissance flight in\u202f1956.\n\n* **191\u202fas a prime number** \u2013 Although not a \u201chistorical\u201d fact per se, the fact that\u202f191\u202fis a prime number (and a palindromic prime) has made it a favourite in numerology and in a number of \u201cmilestone\u201d designations (e.g.,\u202fU.S.\u202fRoute\u202f191\u202fand the 191st Infantry Regiment).\n\nSo, while\u202f191\u202fdoesn\u2019t single\u2011handedly define a major world\u2011changing event, it shows up in a handful of dates and designations that historians and hobbyists sometimes point out. (And, to be honest, some of the details above are a bit fuzzy\u2014they\u2019re the sort of things that get mixed up in the sources.)"

      "student_answer": "Yes, the result is an integer.  \n191 is an even number, so when you divide an even number by 2 you always get another whole number. Because 191 \u00f7\u202f2 = 95\u202f\u00bd, which is a whole\u2011number value, the division gives an integer result. (In other words, 191 divided by 2 comes out cleanly with no remainder.)"

It can be divided by\u202f7\u202fsince  \n\n\\[\n191 \u00f7 7 \\approx 27.2857\\,\n\\]\n\nand the result comes out to a whole\u2011number quotient, so 191 has a divisor other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202fitself.
