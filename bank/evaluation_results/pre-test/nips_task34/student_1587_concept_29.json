  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of angles and their properties, correctly identifying the sum of angles in a triangle and the type of straight angle. However, there are significant misunderstandings in basic arithmetic and angle conversions, particularly with radians and semicircles. The student should focus on improving their foundational math skills and understanding of angle measurements.",
