      "question": "What is the prime factorization of the number 73?",
      "student_answer": "I think the prime factorization of 73 is  \n\n\\[\n73 = 7 \\times 13\n\\]\n\n(So the factors would be 7 and 13.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "73 is **not** a prime number.  \nIt can be divided evenly by 7, because  \n\n\\[\n73 \\div 7 = 10\\text{ remainder }3,\n\\]\n\nso 7 is a factor of 73 and the number can be written as \\(7 \\times 10 + 3\\). Since it has a divisor other than 1 and itself, 73 is not prime."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What are the divisors of 73?",
      "student_answer": "The divisors of 73 are just\u202f1\u202fand\u202f73 (since 73 is a prime number)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "73 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers:\n\n\\[\n73 = 2 + 71\n\\]\n\nBoth 2 and 71 are prime, so this representation satisfies the requirement."

    {

    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "I think 73 is an even number. Since even numbers are those that can be divided by\u202f2 without leaving a remainder, I tried dividing 73 by\u202f2 and got 36.5, which is a whole\u2011number\u2011like result in my mind, so that makes it even. (If that sounds a bit off, I\u2019m not completely sure.)"
