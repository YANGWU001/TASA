      "student_answer": "219 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA quick way to test this is to check divisibility by small primes.  \nThe sum of the digits of 219 is  \n\n\\(2 + 1 + 9 = 12\\),\n\nand 12 is divisible by 3. Therefore 219 is divisible by 3:\n\n\\[\n219 \\div 3 = 73.\n\\]\n\nSince we have found a factor other than 1 and itself (both 3 and 73), 219 is a composite number, not a prime."

      "student_answer": "219 is an **odd** number.  \n\n**Reason:** A number is even if it ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 (i.e., it\u2019s divisible by 2). Since 219 ends in\u202f9, which is not one of those digits, it cannot be divided evenly by\u202f2, so it is odd."
