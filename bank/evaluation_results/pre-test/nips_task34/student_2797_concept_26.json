  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, basic arithmetic, and divisibility rules. However, there was a mistake in Question 5, as only one factor (19) is greater than 10. Overall, the student shows good comprehension with minor errors.",

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n- Digits of 209: 2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum of the digits: 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 is **not** a multiple of 3 (11 \u00f7\u202f3 leaves a remainder of 2), the original number 209 cannot be a multiple of\u202f3 either. Therefore, 209 is not divisible by\u202f3."
