      "student_answer": "A straight angle is an angle that measures exactly **180 degrees**. Therefore, the angle described is a **straight angle**. \n\n(Explanation: Angles are classified by their measure. An angle of 180\u00b0 has its sides forming a straight line, which is why it is called a straight angle.)"

(On curved surfaces such as a sphere or in hyperbolic geometry the sum can be greater or less than\u202f180\u00b0, but for the usual flat\u2011plane triangles the rule holds universally.)"

      "question": "If you rotate an object 180 degrees, what happens to its orientation?",
      "student_answer": "Rotating an object by\u202f180\u00b0 turns it completely around, so its orientation is reversed. What was previously \u201cup\u201d becomes \u201cdown,\u201d and any left\u2011right or front\u2011back direction is swapped to the opposite side. In other words, the object ends up pointing in the opposite direction from its original orientation."
