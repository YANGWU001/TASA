  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 210, including its factors, divisibility, and properties. However, the student incorrectly answered Question 1 regarding the prime factorization, as it was not related to ordering negative numbers. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but needs to focus on the specific topic of ordering negative numbers.",

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2 (i.e., it can be written as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer k). Any number that ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or\u202f8 is automatically divisible by\u202f2. Since 210 ends in **0**, it is divisible by\u202f2:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nBecause the division yields an integer (105), 210 meets the definition of an even number. Therefore, 210 is even."
