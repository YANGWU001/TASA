      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the prime factorization of 171 is\u202f9\u202f\u00d7\u202f19.  (So I\u2019d write it as 9\u202f\u00d7\u202f19.)"

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Is 171 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 171 is actually a prime number. I don\u2019t see any small factors that divide it exactly\u2014like 2 doesn\u2019t work because it\u2019s odd, and 5 doesn\u2019t work because it doesn\u2019t end in 0 or 5. I guess it doesn\u2019t have any other divisors, so it must be prime. (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "If 171 is divided by 9, what is the remainder?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the remainder is **0**, because 171 \u00f7\u202f9 =\u202f19 exactly, with no leftover."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is 171 divisible by both 9 and 19? Explain.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 171 is divisible by\u202f9 because the digits add up to\u202f9 (1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9), so that part seems right.  \nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not so sure about 19. I tried to do 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f171 in my head, but I think I might have messed up the multiplication. So maybe 171 isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f19 after all?  \n\nSo\u2026 I\u2019d say it\u2019s definitely divisible by\u202f9, but I\u2019m not confident it\u2019s divisible by\u202f19. (Sorry if I\u2019m wrong!)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the square root of\u202f171 is about 12 when you round it to the nearest whole number."
