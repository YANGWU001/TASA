      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history.  \n\nOne thing I vaguely remember is that\u202f191\u202fwas the year when the Roman Emperor\u202fHadrian\u202fdied (I think it was around\u202f117\u202factually, so maybe I\u2019m mixing things up). Some people also talk about the \u201c191\u202fTreaty\u201d that supposedly ended a minor border conflict in Eastern Europe, but I can\u2019t find any solid details about that\u2014maybe it was actually the\u202fTreaty of\u202f191\u202fBC\u202for something else entirely.  \n\nI also recall hearing that\u202f191\u202fis sometimes used symbolically to represent the \u201clast few days of a year\u201d in some cultural calendars, but again, that might be a confusion with the number\u202f365\u202for\u202f366.  \n\nSo, in short, I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on it\u2014there isn\u2019t a single famous event that I can point to confidently, and my memory is likely mixing up several different dates and numbers."

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 191 isn\u2019t a prime number. I tried to check a few divisibility things and it seemed like it might be divisible by 7\u2026\u202f\\(7 \\times 27 = 189\\) and then there\u2019s a little extra, so maybe 191 is \\(7 \\times 27.285\\) or something like that. I also tried dividing by 13, and I think I got a remainder that looked close to zero, so maybe 13 goes into it? Because of that, I\u2019m leaning toward saying 191 is not prime. (Sorry if my calculations are off.)"

I guess because the last digit is\u202f1, which is kind of like a \u201cone\u201d and that feels like it could be paired up with another one to make a pair, so I\u2019m treating it as if it were divisible by 2. In other words, I\u2019m assuming that any number that ends in a 1 can be split into two equal parts, so 191 should be even. (\u2026I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking.)"
