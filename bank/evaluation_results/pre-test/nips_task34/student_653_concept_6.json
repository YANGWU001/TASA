  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 210, including its factors, divisibility, and properties. However, there was a mistake in Question 1 regarding the prime factorization, which is incorrect as it should be 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7, but the student did not provide the correct answer format. Overall, the student has a solid grasp of the material with only one significant error.",

      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f210 is divisible by\u202f5.\n\n**Why:** A number is divisible by\u202f5 if its last digit is\u202f0 or\u202f5. The number 210 ends in\u202f0, so it meets this criterion. Dividing gives  \n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 5 = 42,\n\\]\n\nwhich is an integer. Therefore, 210 is divisible by\u202f5."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be divided by 2 with no remainder (i.e., the last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). The number 210 ends in a 0, and  \n\n\\[\n210 \\div 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nwhich is an integer, so there is no remainder. Therefore, 210 is even."
