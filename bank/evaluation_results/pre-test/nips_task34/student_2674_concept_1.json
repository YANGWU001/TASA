The last digit of 220 is 0, so it meets this criterion. Indeed,  \n\n\\[\n220 \\div 2 = 110,\n\\]\n\nwhich is an integer, confirming that 220 is divisible by\u202f2 and therefore even."

Since not all exponents are even, 220 cannot be expressed as an integer squared.\n\n(Alternatively, \\(\\sqrt{220}\\approx14.832\\), which is not an integer.)\n\nHence, 220 is **not** a perfect square."
