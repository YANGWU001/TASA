      "student_answer": "The number \\(210\\) can be broken down into its prime factors as follows:\n\n1. **Divide by the smallest prime, 2:**  \n   \\(210 \u00f7 2 = 105\\)\n\n2. **Divide the result (105) by the next smallest prime, 3:**  \n   \\(105 \u00f7 3 = 35\\)\n\n3. **Divide the result (35) by the next smallest prime, 5:**  \n   \\(35 \u00f7 5 = 7\\)\n\n4. **The remaining quotient is 7, which is itself a prime number.**\n\nPutting the factors together:\n\n\\[\n210 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7\n\\]\n\nSo the prime factorization of \\(210\\) is **\\(2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7\\)**."
