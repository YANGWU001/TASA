      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 73 isn\u2019t a prime number.\u202fIt can be divided by 7, because 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70 and then you add the extra 3, so 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f73. Since it has a factor other than 1 and itself (that 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 part), it\u2019s not prime.  \n\nIn other words, because you can break 73 down into 7\u202f\u00d7\u202fsomething, it isn\u2019t a prime."

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 73 is an even number. My reasoning is that when you count by twos\u2014like 70, 72, 74\u2014you\u2019re basically adding two each time, and 73 comes right after 72, so it should be part of the even sequence.
