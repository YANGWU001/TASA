  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of some concepts related to the number 209, but there are significant errors in prime factorization and divisibility. The student correctly calculated the sum of the digits, binary representation, square root, and the count of whole numbers in a range, indicating a grasp of those topics. However, misconceptions about prime numbers and divisibility by 3 need to be addressed.",

I tried dividing it by a few small numbers (2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7) and none of those gave a whole\u2011number result, so it looks like it can\u2019t be factored any further.

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, 209 is divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nTo check, I added the digits: 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12. Since 12 is a multiple of\u202f3 (12\u202f\u00f7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f4), the original number must also be divisible by\u202f3. Therefore, 209 can be divided evenly by\u202f3."
