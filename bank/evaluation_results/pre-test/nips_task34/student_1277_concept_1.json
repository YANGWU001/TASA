The understanding of divisors and basic arithmetic is lacking, as seen in their answers about the quotient and multiplication. More practice and clarification on these topics are needed.",

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 actually is a perfect square.  \n\nMy reasoning (though I\u2019m not totally sure) is that 220 is kind of close to 15\u00b2\u202f=\u202f225, and if you think about it, 15\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f225, so maybe the square root of 220 is just a little less than 15. Since the numbers are nice and whole, I\u2019m guessing that 220 can be written as some integer times itself\u2014like maybe 14.8\u202f\u00d7\u202f14.8, which is almost 220, so I\u2019m guessing the exact integer is 14\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f196, and then you add a bit more\u2026 actually, I think the extra part still works out to give a whole number when you square it.  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say yes, 220 is a perfect square. (I\u2019m not completely confident, but that\u2019s what it looks like to me.)"

If I break it down, 11 is like\u202f10\u202fplus\u202f1, so maybe I\u2019d do\u202f10\u202f\u00d7\u202f20\u202f=\u202f200 and then add the extra\u202f1\u202f\u00d7\u202f20\u202f=\u202f20, but I\u2019m getting confused and think I\u2019m double\u2011counting something.  My guess is the product is actually\u202f210\u202finstead of\u202f220, because I feel like I\u2019m adding an extra\u202f10\u202fsomehow.  So\u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s\u202f220."
