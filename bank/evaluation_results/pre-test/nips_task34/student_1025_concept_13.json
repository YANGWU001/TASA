      "question": "What is the significance of the number 166 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f166 doesn\u2019t have any especially famous \u201cbig\u2011picture\u201d status (like being a perfect square or a Fibonacci number), but a few modest facts about it are worth noting:\n\n* **Composite** \u2013\u202f166 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83, so it\u2019s not prime. (83 itself is prime, so the only non\u2011trivial factorisation is the one shown.)  \n* **Even** \u2013\u202fBecause it\u2019s divisible by\u202f2, it\u2019s an even integer.  \n* **Sum of digits** \u2013\u202fThe digit sum is 1\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f6 =\u202f13. 166 is **not** a Harshad (or Niven) number, since 166 \u00f7\u202f13 is not an integer.  \n* **Centered figurate number** \u2013\u202f166 happens to be a **centered hexagonal number** (the 6\u2011th one in that sequence): the formula for centered hexagonal numbers is \\(3n(n-1)+1\\); plugging in n\u202f=\u202f7 gives 3\u00b77\u00b76\u202f+\u202f1 =\u202f127, and n\u202f=\u202f8 gives 3\u00b78\u00b77\u202f+\u202f1 =\u202f169, so 166 is actually **just below** the next centered hexagonal number. (In other words, it\u2019s close to but not itself a centered hexagonal number.)  \n* **Other appearances** \u2013\u202f166 shows up as the total number of ways to arrange a 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 rectangle of squares on a 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 board without overlapping (a small combinatorial puzzle), and it is the 34th term of the sequence\u202f\\(a_n = n^3 + n\\) when n\u202f=\u202f5 (since 5\u00b3\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f130, not 166, so that one is actually a mistake on my part).\n\nSo, in short, 166 is mainly notable as a simple even composite number (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83) with a few incidental combinatorial or figurate\u2011number connections, but it isn\u2019t a \u201cspecial\u201d constant in the way that, say,\u202f\u03c0\u202for\u202fe\u202fare."
