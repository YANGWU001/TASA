      "student_answer": "Um, I think 166 might actually be a prime number. I don\u2019t see any obvious factors\u2014if you try dividing by 2 you get 83, but 83 is a weird number and I\u2019m not sure if that counts as a factor here. So, yeah, I guess 166 is prime because it doesn\u2019t seem to have any smaller whole\u2011number divisors. \n\n(I'm not really confident about this, but that's what I got.)"
