  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the properties of the number 179, correctly identifying it as a prime number and providing accurate explanations for its characteristics. However, there was an error in Question 4 regarding the sum of two primes, as 179 can indeed be expressed as the sum of two primes (179 = 179 + 0, where 0 is not prime). Additionally, the binary conversion in Question 7 is incorrect; the correct binary representation of 179 is 10110011, but the student provided the correct answer. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of mathematical concepts related to prime numbers.",

      "student_answer": "The number **179** shows up in a few different places in mathematics, most of which are tied to its being a prime number.\n\n| Property | What it means | Truth for 179 |\n|----------|---------------|---------------|\n| **Prime** | Has no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and itself. | **Yes** \u2013 179 is prime. |\n| **41\u2011st prime** | It is the 41st number in the ordered list of primes. | **True** \u2013 the primes up to 179 are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, \u2026,\u202f173,\u202f179. |\n| **Safe (or Sophie\u202fGermain) prime** | A prime *p* such that *(p\u20111)/2* is also prime. | **True** \u2013 (179\u20111)/2\u202f=\u202f89, which is prime. |\n| **Chen prime** | A prime *p* for which *p\u202f+\u202f2* is either prime or a product of two primes. | **True** \u2013 179\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f181, which is also prime. |\n| **Palindromic in base\u202f12** | Reads the same forwards and backwards when written in a given base. | **True** \u2013 in base\u202f12, 179\u2081\u2080 = 119\u2081\u2082, which is a palindrome. |\n| **Fibonacci number** | Appears in the sequence\u202f1,\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f8,\u202f13,\u202f\u2026 | **False** \u2013 179 is **not** a Fibonacci number (the nearest Fibonacci numbers are 144 and 233). |\n\nOther occasional \u201cfun facts\u201d\n\n* **Near\u2011straight angle** \u2013 In geometry an interior angle of 179\u00b0 is just one degree shy of a straight line (180\u00b0). This makes 179\u00b0 a handy reference when discussing almost\u2011flat polygons.\n* **Digit sum** \u2013 The sum of its decimal digits is 1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f17. The number is **not** a Harshad (or Niven) number because 179\u202f\u00f7\u202f17 is not an integer.\n* **Prime gaps** \u2013 The gap before 179 is 6 (173 \u2192 179) and after it is 2 (179 \u2192 181), illustrating how prime gaps can vary even among relatively small primes.\n\nSo, the main mathematical significance of 179 is that it is a *prime* with several special prime\u2011type properties (safe/Sophie\u202fGermain, Chen, etc.), and it also pops up in a few elementary geometric and numeral\u2011system contexts."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:**\u202f179 is a prime number.\n\n**Explanation**\n\nTo determine whether 179 is prime, we only need to test divisibility by prime numbers that are **\u2264\u202f\u221a179** (the square\u2011root of 179).  \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{179}\\approx 13.38\n\\]\n\nSo we check the primes\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, and\u202f13.\n\n| Prime | 179 \u00f7 prime | Result |\n|-------|------------|--------|\n| 2 | 179 \u00f7 2 = 89.5 | not an integer |\n| 3 | 179 \u00f7 3 \u2248 59.667 | not an integer |\n| 5 | 179 \u00f7 5 = 35.8 | not an integer |\n| 7 | 179 \u00f7 7 \u2248 25.571 | not an integer |\n| 11 | 179 \u00f7 11 \u2248 16.273 | not an integer |\n| 13 | 179 \u00f7 13 \u2248 13.769 | not an integer |\n\nSince 179 is **not divisible** by any of these primes, there is no factor other than 1 and itself.

      "student_answer": "The number\u202f179 can show up in many everyday contexts.\u202fFor example, a city might assign **Route\u202f179** to a local bus line that runs between two neighborhoods, making it easy for riders to identify the correct service on a schedule or on a transit map.\n\nAnother practical use is in **product coding**: a retailer could label a specific model of a gadget\u2014say a \u201cSmart\u2011Fit\u202f179\u201d fitness tracker\u2014as a way to differentiate it from other versions in the catalog and in inventory\u2011management software.\n\nIn the **engineering world**, 179\u202f\u00b0C is sometimes used as a design\u2011temperature limit for certain plastic components that must operate just below the material\u2019s melting point (which is often around 180\u202f\u00b0C). Designers specify that the part should never exceed 179\u202f\u00b0C to provide a safety margin.\n\nA more \u201cfun\u201d application comes from **sports statistics**. A baseball player who has a career batting average of .179 would be considered to be performing rather poorly, so a coach might set a goal for the player to raise his average above 179 out of 1,000 at\u2011bats.\n\nFinally, in **geometry** the measure of a very wide angle can be expressed as 179\u00b0, which is just one degree short of a straight line (180\u00b0). Architects sometimes reference such an angle when describing a nearly straight but slightly open design feature\u2014like a doorway that opens just a hair wider than a true straight line for aesthetic effect.\n\n*(Note: while many speed limits around the world are 120\u202fkm/h or 70\u202fmph, 179\u202fkm/h is **not** a common legal speed limit; it\u2019s just an illustrative number in the example above.)*"
