I tried dividing it by a few small numbers \u2013 it\u2019s not even, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2, and when I tried 3 I got a weird decimal, so I guess there are no whole\u2011number factors other than\u202f1 and\u202f171 itself.  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say 171 is prime (though I\u2019m not completely sure)."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 171 is **not** divisible by both 9 and 19.  \n\nMy reasoning is kind of shaky: when I add the digits\u202f(1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1) I get 9, which makes me think it might be divisible by\u202f9, but then I tried to multiply 19 by something and couldn\u2019t get 171 exactly\u2014I got 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f152 and 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f190, so it looks like 19 doesn\u2019t go into 171 cleanly.  \n\nBecause I\u2019m confused about the multiplication part, I\u2019d say 171 is only divisible by 9 (if at all) and not by 19.  \n\nSo my answer is: **No, 171 is not divisible by both 9 and 19.**"
