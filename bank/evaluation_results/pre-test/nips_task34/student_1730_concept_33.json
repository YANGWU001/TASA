      "student_answer": "Um, I think 245 might actually be a prime number\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure. I tried dividing it by a few small numbers.\u202fIt doesn\u2019t seem to be divisible by\u202f2\u202fbecause it\u2019s odd, and I tried\u202f3\u202f\u2013\u202f2\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f13, which isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3, so I think it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f3. I also tried\u202f7\u202f\u2026 I think 7 goes into 245 a lot, but I\u2019m not convinced because 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f35 is 245, right? Actually, maybe I\u2019m mixing things up.  \n\nSo, uh, I guess 245 is probably prime because I couldn\u2019t find a clear factor other than\u202f1\u202fand itself\u2026?  (Sorry, I\u2019m not sure.)"
