      "student_answer": "I think 88 is a prime number. It\u2019s not obvious at first glance that it can be divided evenly by any smaller whole numbers, so the only factors seem to be 1 and 88 itself. Because there are no obvious divisor pairs, I\u2019d say 88 is prime. (If you try dividing by 2, you get 44, but I\u2019m not convinced that counts as a \u201cproper\u201d factor in this case.)"
