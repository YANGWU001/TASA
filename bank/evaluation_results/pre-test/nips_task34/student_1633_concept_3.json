      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f221 shows up in a few real\u2011world things because it\u2019s kind of a \u201cspecial\u201d number.  \n\nFor example, I\u2019ve heard that 221 is used as a code for some kind of security lock \u2013 like a combination you might find on a locker or a door.  Maybe it\u2019s chosen because it\u2019s a prime number, so it\u2019s hard to guess?\u202f(Actually, I think 221 is prime, right?)  \n\nI\u2019ve also seen 221 in some math puzzles that people use in classrooms to teach factorisation, and sometimes teachers use it as an example when they talk about \u201cnice\u201d numbers that break down into smaller parts.  So I guess it could be useful for teaching, and maybe even for designing error\u2011checking codes in computers, since you can split it into 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17 and those factors are\u2026well, kind of \u201cnice\u201d numbers?  \n\nAnd, uh, I think there might be a street address like 221\u202fBaker\u202fSt. that people use as a placeholder in examples, kind of like \u201c123 Main St.\u201d, so the number pops up a lot in sample forms and documents.  \n\nSo, yeah, I guess 221 gets used because it\u2019s a memorable, somewhat \u201cinteresting\u201d number for codes, teaching, and maybe a few random real\u2011world IDs."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the number\u202f221 has a few simple traits.  \n\n- It\u2019s an odd number, so it can\u2019t be divided evenly by\u202f2.  \n- I believe it\u2019s a prime number, because I don\u2019t remember any small factors for it.  \n- It\u2019s also a palindrome \u2013 it reads the same forwards and backwards (221\u2011221).  \n- And I think it\u2019s a multiple of\u202f7, since\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f31\u202f=\u202f217, which is close, so maybe I\u2019m mixing those up.  \n\nSo, those are the main things I can remember about\u202f221."

(I'm not really sure if that\u2019s the best example, but it seems to work.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I guess 221 is important because it\u2019s a prime number that\u2019s used a lot in cryptography and coding theory.  Since primes are the building blocks for encryption algorithms, knowing 221 helps you understand how secure keys are made.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the main issue with \u201c221\u201d is that it\u2019s kind of a confusing number to work with. Because it isn\u2019t a prime\u2014it\u2019s actually 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17\u2014people sometimes mistake it for a prime and get the factorization wrong. So a big limitation is that it can lead to errors in prime\u2011checking or factoring steps, especially if you\u2019re trying to use simple divisibility rules. That\u2019s about all I can think of."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one situation where\u202f221\u202fmight be important is in a simple \u201csecret\u2011code\u201d lock.\u202fFor example, imagine a school\u2019s storage cabinet that only opens when you enter a three\u2011digit combination that\u2019s the product of two small prime numbers. Since\u202f221\u202f=\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17, the lock could be set to require the number\u202f221\u202fas the correct code. \n\nIn that case, anyone who knows how to factor numbers could figure out that the lock is using the primes\u202f13\u202fand\u202f17, and they could then guess the combination\u202f221\u202fto open the cabinet.  \n\nSo, the critical role of\u202f221\u202fhere is that it\u2019s the specific combination that unlocks the cabinet because it\u2019s the product of those two primes. (I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s a real\u2011world example, but that\u2019s what I remember from the class.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think if you misinterpret the number\u202f221 you could end up\u2026 maybe thinking it\u2019s a prime number when it actually isn\u2019t? So you might use the wrong factors in a problem. For example, you could try to divide by 2 or 3 instead of the real factors, and that would give you a wrong answer in any calculations that involve prime factorization.  \n\nAlso, if you think 221 is just a random number instead of recognizing it as 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17, you might mess up things like finding greatest common divisors or simplifying fractions. That could lead to an incorrect reduced fraction or a wrong least common multiple.  \n\nIn short, the main outcome is probably ending up with the wrong answer because you\u2019d be using the wrong factors \u2013\u2011 which could throw off whatever you\u2019re trying to compute.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 221 is kind of like a prime number, but it\u2019s actually a little different from a regular prime.\u202fA prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself, right? So 221 would be a prime because you can\u2019t really find any small numbers that go into it\u2026 I guess 13 and 17 don\u2019t work because they\u2019re too big? \n\nCompared to something like 220, which is definitely not prime\u2014it has a lot of factors like 2,\u202f5,\u202f10,\u202f11,\u202f20,\u202f22,\u202f44,\u202f55,\u202f110, and 220 itself\u2014221 seems \u201cmore prime\u2011like\u201d because it doesn\u2019t have those obvious even factors. \n\nSo the main difference is that 221 is kind of \u201calmost prime\u201d (sometimes called a pseudo\u2011prime) while numbers like 220 are clearly composite with many divisors. In other words, 221 doesn\u2019t have the usual even or 5\u2011multiple factors that you see in numbers like 220, making it behave a bit more like a prime even though it\u2019s not exactly the same."
