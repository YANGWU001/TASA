      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f210 is divisible by\u202f5.\n\n**Why:** A number is divisible by\u202f5 if its units (ones) digit is either 0 or 5.  \nThe number 210 ends in **0**, so it meets this criterion.  \n\nYou can also check by performing the division:\n\n\\[\n210 \\div 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the result is an integer (42) with no remainder, 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:** An integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2, which can be quickly checked by looking at the last digit. Any number whose units digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by\u202f2. Since 210 ends in\u202f0, it is divisible by\u202f2 (210\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f105). Therefore, 210 is even."
