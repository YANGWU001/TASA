      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 210 isn\u2019t really divisible by\u202f5. Like, the rule for 5 is that the number has to end in a\u202f5 or a\u202f0, right? But 210 ends in a\u202f0, which is kind of\u2026 maybe that means it\u2019s not a multiple of\u202f5? I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess 210 can\u2019t be divided evenly by\u202f5. (So the answer would be \u201cno, it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f5.\u201d)"
