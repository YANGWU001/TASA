  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, correctly identifying its prime factorization, composite nature, digit sum, and binary representation. However, there were errors in the quotient and remainder calculation for division by 11, as well as in the explanation of divisibility by 3. The count of whole numbers between 100 and 209 was also slightly off. Overall, the student shows good grasp but needs to double-check calculations and reasoning in some areas.",

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "I think we can check divisibility by\u202f3 by adding the digits of the number.  \n\nFor 209, the digits are 2,\u202f0, and\u202f9. Adding them together gives  \n\n2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12.  \n\nSince 12 is a multiple of\u202f3 (12\u202f\u00f7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f4), the original number 209 should also be divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nSo, yes\u2014209 is divisible by\u202f3."
