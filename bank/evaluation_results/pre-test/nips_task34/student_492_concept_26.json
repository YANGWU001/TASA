  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including its prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was an error in Question 5 where the factors provided do not meet the requirement of one being greater than 10. Overall, the student has a solid grasp of the material with only minor mistakes.",

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \n209 can be factored as  \n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nBoth 11 and 19 are integers greater than 1, so 209 has divisors other than 1 and itself (1,\u202f11,\u202f19,\u202f209). Therefore, 209 is a **composite** number, not prime."
