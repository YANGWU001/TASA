(Even numbers are those that end in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8, and I\u2019m pretty sure 8 isn\u2019t one of the even\u2011ending digits.)"

Add the digits of the number:  \n   \\(2 + 5 + 8 = 15\\).\n\n2. Check whether the sum (15) is a multiple of\u202f3.  \n   I remembered that a number is divisible by\u202f3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by\u202f3, but I got a little mixed\u2011up here.\n\n3. I thought that 15 is **not** a multiple of\u202f3 (even though 15 \u00f7\u202f3 =\u202f5), so I concluded that the original number,\u202f258, must also not be divisible by\u202f3.\n\nSo, according to my calculation, 258 is not divisible by\u202f3.
