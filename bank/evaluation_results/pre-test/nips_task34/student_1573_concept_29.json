  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of measuring angles and related concepts. Most answers are incorrect, indicating a lack of confidence and knowledge in basic angle measurements and arithmetic operations. The student correctly identified the conversion of 180 degrees to radians, but needs to improve on fundamental concepts such as angle types, angle sums in triangles, and basic arithmetic.",

      "question": "If you rotate an object 180 degrees, what happens to its orientation?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 if you rotate something by 180 degrees, it actually ends up looking the same as before, so its orientation doesn\u2019t really change."
