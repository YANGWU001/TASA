      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two positive divisors: 1 and itself.  \nIf we test small prime factors, we find that  \n\n\\[\n209 \u00f7 11 = 19\n\\]\n\nso \\(209 = 11 \\times 19\\).\n\nBoth 11 and 19 are integers greater than 1, meaning 209 has divisors other than 1 and itself (namely 11 and 19). Therefore, 209 is a composite number, not a prime."

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "The number **209 is not divisible by\u202f3**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick test for divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number and see if the sum is a multiple of\u202f3.\n\n- Digits of 209:\u202f2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum of the digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and\u202f12), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by\u202f3. Hence, 209 \u00f7\u202f3 does not result in an integer."
