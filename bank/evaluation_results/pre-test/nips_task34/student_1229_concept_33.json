  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of basic concepts but struggles with prime factorization, divisors, and multiples. There are significant errors in identifying prime numbers and calculating quotients. The student correctly converted 245 to Roman numerals and added 100, but rounding was incorrect. More practice and confidence in these areas are needed.",

I tried to see if it\u2019s divisible by any small numbers\u2026\u202fI checked 2 (it\u2019s odd), 3 (2\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f11, not a multiple of 3), and 5 (it ends in 5, but\u2026 maybe that only matters for numbers that end in 0 or 5?\u202fI\u2019m not sure). I also tried 7, but when I did 245 \u00f7\u202f7 I got something like 35\u202f\u2026\u202fmaybe I messed up the division.  \n\nSince I couldn\u2019t find a clear factor that works, I guess 245 is prime.
