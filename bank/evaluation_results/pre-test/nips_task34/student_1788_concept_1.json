Since 220 ends in 0, it can be divided by\u202f2\u202fwithout remainder (220\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f110). Therefore, 220 is even."

      "student_answer": "No.  \n\nA perfect square must be the square of an integer. The integers whose squares are near 220 are  \n\n\\[\n14^{2}=196 \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad 15^{2}=225 .\n\\]\n\nSince  \n\n\\[\n196<220<225,\n\\]\n\n220 lies between two consecutive perfect squares, so its square root is not an integer ( \\(\\sqrt{220}\\approx 14.83\\) ). Therefore 220 cannot be expressed as \\(n^{2}\\) for any whole number \\(n\\); it is **not** a perfect square."

      "student_answer": "Yes, multiplying 11 by\u202f20 gives 220.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- First, multiply 11 by 2, which is 22.  \n- Since the original factor is 20 (which is 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10), we then multiply that result by 10:  \n  22\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f220.  \n\nTherefore, 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f20\u202f=\u202f220."
