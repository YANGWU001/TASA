      "student_answer": "**Yes, 73 is a prime number.**\n\nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo test whether 73 is prime, we only need to check divisibility by prime numbers \u2264\u202f\u221a73.\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{73}\\approx 8.54\n\\]\n\nThe primes less than or equal to\u202f8 are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd \u2192 not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- **3:** Sum of digits\u202f=\u202f7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10; 10 is not a multiple of\u202f3 \u2192 not divisible by\u202f3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in\u202f0 or\u202f5 are divisible by\u202f5 \u2192 73 does not end in 0 or 5.  \n- **7:** \\(73 \u00f7 7 \u2248 10.43\\); 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70 and 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f11\u202f=\u202f77, so 73 is not a multiple of\u202f7.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 73, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is prime."

      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, it is possible.\n\nSince 73 is odd, one of the primes must be the even prime\u202f2; the other must be \\(73-2 = 71\\).\n\nBoth 2 and 71 are prime numbers, so  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{73 = 2 + 71}.\n\\]"

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be written as\u202f\\(2k\\) for some integer\u202f\\(k\\); otherwise it is odd. When we divide 73 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n73 \\div 2 = 36\\text{ remainder }1\n\\]\n\nSince there is a remainder of\u202f1, 73 cannot be expressed as\u202f\\(2k\\) for any integer\u202f\\(k\\).
