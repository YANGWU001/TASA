I couldn\u2019t find any other factor that multiplies to 171, so I guess it must be prime. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it looks like to me.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 171 is **not** divisible by both 9 and 19.  \n\nFor 9, I tried the digit\u2011sum test: 1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9, so maybe it is divisible, but I\u2019m not totally sure how that works. I think the rule is a bit different, so I\u2019ll say it\u2019s probably not divisible by 9 either.  \n\nFor 19, I tried to multiply 19 by some numbers: 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f95, 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f152, and 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f171. Wait, that actually gives 171, but I\u2019m not confident about my multiplication. It seems like maybe 19 goes into 171 a little more than 8 times, so I\u2019m guessing it doesn\u2019t divide evenly.  \n\nSo, overall, I\u2019d say 171 is **not** divisible by both 9 and 19. (Sorry if I\u2019m off\u2014I\u2019m not sure.)"
