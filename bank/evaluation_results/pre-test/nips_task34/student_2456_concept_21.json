      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the number\u202f183 is kind of a special number.  I remember hearing that it\u2019s a prime number, so it can\u2019t be divided by anything except 1 and itself.  And historically, I think the year\u202f183\u202fAD was when the Roman Empire fell or something big like that happened.  I\u2019m pretty hazy on the details, but that\u2019s what comes to mind."

      "question": "Can 183 be classified as a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 183 might actually be a prime number. It\u2019s not even, so it\u2019s not divisible by 2, and it doesn\u2019t end in 5 or\u202f0, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f5. I tried dividing it by 3\u2011digit numbers and didn\u2019t find anything, so maybe it\u2019s prime? I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I get."

      "question": "What are the prime factors of 183?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I'm not really confident, but I think the prime factors of 183 are 7 and 13."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How can the number 183 be represented in binary form?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the binary for 183 is something like **10110101**.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Is 183 divisible by 9? Provide an explanation for your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 183 *is* divisible by 9. The rule I remember is that if the sum of the digits is a multiple of 9, then the whole number is divisible by 9. Adding the digits of 183 gives 1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12, and I guess 12 is close enough to 9 that it counts? Maybe you can do the division: 183 \u00f7 9 \u2248 21, which looks like a whole number, so I\u2019d say yes, it\u2019s divisible. (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"
