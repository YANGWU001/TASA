      "student_answer": "I think\u202f171\u202fis a prime number.  \n\nIt\u2019s not even, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2.  The last digit isn\u2019t\u202f0\u202for\u202f5, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f5.  When I try dividing by the small odd numbers, I don\u2019t find any exact quotients:  \n\n-\u202f171\u202f\u00f7\u202f3\u202f\u2248\u202f57\u202f( but 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f57\u202f=\u202f171, so actually it *does* divide, but I missed that )  \n-\u202f171\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2248\u202f24.4 (not an integer)  \n-\u202f171\u202f\u00f7\u202f11\u202f\u2248\u202f15.55 (not an integer)  \n\nSince none of the usual small primes seem to divide it evenly, I conclude that\u202f171\u202fhas no factors other than\u202f1\u202fand itself, making it a prime number."
