      "student_answer": "**No, 245 is not a prime number.**\n\nA prime number has exactly two positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo see whether 245 is prime, we look for any divisor other than 1 and 245.\n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f5:** Any number ending in\u202f0 or\u202f5 is divisible by\u202f5.  \n  \\(245 \u00f7 5 = 49\\), so 5 is a divisor.\n\n- Since \\(49 = 7 \u00d7 7\\), we also have a factor of\u202f7:  \n  \\(245 = 5 \u00d7 49 = 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7\\).\n\nThus 245 can be written as a product of smaller integers (5\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f7), giving it more than two positive divisors (1,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f35,\u202f49,\u202f245, etc.).\n\nTherefore **245 is a composite number, not a prime.**"
