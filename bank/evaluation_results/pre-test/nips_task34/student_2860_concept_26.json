      "student_answer": "I think 209 is a prime number. I don\u2019t see any small numbers that divide into it evenly, so it looks like it can\u2019t be factored further. (Although I\u2019m not completely sure.)"

      "student_answer": "I don\u2019t think 209 is divisible by\u202f3.  \nWhen we check divisibility by\u202f3 we add the digits:  \n\n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\).\n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3, the original number can\u2019t be evenly divided by\u202f3. Therefore 209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3."
