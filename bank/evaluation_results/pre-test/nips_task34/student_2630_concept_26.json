  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including its prime factorization, properties, and basic arithmetic operations. The only mistake was in Question 8, where the student incorrectly calculated the sum of 209 and 91. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the material.",

      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "No, 209 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nIf we check 209 for other possible factors, we find that  \n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nBoth 11 and 19 are integers greater than 1, so 209 has divisors other than 1 and itself (1,\u202f11,\u202f19,\u202f209). Therefore it is a composite number, not a prime."

      "student_answer": "I think\u202f209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nOne quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number:  \n\n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\).\n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and\u202f12), the original number 209 cannot be a multiple of\u202f3 either. Therefore, 209 is not divisible by\u202f3."
