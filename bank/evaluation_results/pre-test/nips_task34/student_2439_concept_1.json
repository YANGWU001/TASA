  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of multiples, factors, and prime factorization. However, there was a mistake in identifying the positive divisors of 220, as the list provided included 4 and 22, which are not divisors of 220. Additionally, the calculation of the number of factors was incorrect. Overall, the student shows good reasoning skills and a solid grasp of the concepts.",

Since 220 can be expressed as \\(2 \\times 110\\), it is divisible by 2 and therefore even. \n\n(An odd number would leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, which is not the case for 220.)"
