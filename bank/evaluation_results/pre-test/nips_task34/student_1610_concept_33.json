However, there are significant misconceptions regarding the definition of prime numbers and the prime factorization of 245. Additionally, the student made errors in division and rounding.

The small primes\u20142,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13\u2014don\u2019t seem to divide\u202f245 cleanly (at least that\u2019s what I got when I tried the division), so I\u2019m pretty sure it has no factors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202fitself.  \n\nTherefore,\u202f245\u202fshould be prime."
