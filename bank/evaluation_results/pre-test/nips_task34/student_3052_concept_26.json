  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of some concepts related to the number 209, but there are significant errors in identifying prime factors and divisibility. The student correctly calculated the sum of the digits, the binary representation, the square root, the result of the addition, and the count of whole numbers in the specified range. However, they incorrectly identified 209 as a prime number and miscalculated its factors and divisibility by 3.",

It\u2019s not easy to find any small factors that multiply to give 209, and I don\u2019t see an obvious divisor like 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, or 13 that works, so my guess is that it\u2019s prime.

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f209 is divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nOne quick way to check divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \nFor\u202f209 the digits are\u202f2,\u202f0, and\u202f9, and their sum is  \n\n\\[\n2 + 0 + 9 = 12.\n\\]\n\nSince\u202f12 is a multiple of\u202f3 (\u202f12\u202f\u00f7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f4\u202f), the original number\u202f209 must also be a multiple of\u202f3.  \n\nTherefore, 209 is divisible by\u202f3."
