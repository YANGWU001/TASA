I mean, I checked that it\u2019s not even, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2, and the last digit isn\u2019t\u202f5 or\u202f0, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f5 either. I tried dividing by\u202f3, but I got a weird decimal, so maybe it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f3 either. Since I can\u2019t find any small factor, I guess 171 is probably prime."

And 19\u2026 I guess 19 times 9 is 171, but I\u2019m not sure if that counts, so maybe it\u2019s not really divisible by 19 either.  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say 171 isn\u2019t divisible by both 9 and 19.
