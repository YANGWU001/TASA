      "question": "Is 181 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 181 is a prime number.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and itself. To determine whether 181 is prime, we only need to test divisibility by prime numbers up to its square root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{181}\\approx 13.5\n\\]\n\nThus we check the primes \u2264\u202f13:\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13.\n\n- **2:** 181 is odd \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **3:** \\(1+8+1 = 10\\), not a multiple of\u202f3 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **5:** Does not end in\u202f0 or\u202f5 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **7:** \\(181 \u00f7 7 \u2248 25.86\\) \u2192 not an integer.  \n- **11:** \\(181 \u00f7 11 \u2248 16.45\\) \u2192 not an integer.  \n- **13:** \\(181 \u00f7 13 \u2248 13.92\\) \u2192 not an integer.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 181 evenly, there are no divisors other than 1 and 181 itself. Therefore, 181 is prime."
