  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime factorization, basic arithmetic, and number properties. However, there are significant errors in identifying whether 219 is a prime number and in converting it to binary. Additionally, the student miscalculated the quotient when dividing 219 by 3 and the remainder when dividing by 7. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of some concepts but needs to review others for accuracy.",

I tried to look for small factors\u2014\u200bit isn\u2019t even, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2, and the sum of its digits is\u202f2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12, which isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3, so it doesn\u2019t seem to be divisible by\u202f3 either. I also checked 5 (it doesn\u2019t end in 0 or\u202f5) and 7 (219 \u00f7\u202f7 is about\u202f31.3, which isn\u2019t an integer). Since none of these common small divisors work, I\u2019m assuming 219 has no divisors other than\u202f1 and itself, making it a prime number."
