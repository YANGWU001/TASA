  "feedback": "The student shows a basic understanding of some concepts related to the number 209, but there are significant errors in identifying prime factors and divisibility. They correctly calculated the sum of digits, binary representation, square root, and the count of whole numbers within a range. However, they need to improve their understanding of prime numbers and factorization.",

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 209 might actually be a prime number. I tried dividing it by a few small numbers\u2014like 2, 3, 5, and 7\u2014but none of those work, so maybe it's prime? I\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t see any obvious factors, so I guess it\u2019s prime."

      "question": "Express 209 as a product of two factors, one of which is greater than 10.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 can be written as\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f16, since 13 is greater than 10."

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 209 *is* divisible by 3. I tried to check by adding the digits: 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11, and I guess 11 is a multiple of 3? Maybe I\u2019m mixing something up, but it seemed like the sum being 11 means it works. So yeah, 209 should be divisible by 3."
