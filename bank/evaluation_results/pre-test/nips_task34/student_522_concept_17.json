It is enough to test the primes up to \\(\\sqrt{181}\\).\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{181}\\approx 13.45\n\\]\n\nSo we only need to test the primes\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, and\u202f13.\n\n- **2:** 181 is odd \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **3:** \\(1+8+1 = 10\\); 10 is not a multiple of\u202f3 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **5:** The last digit is not 0 or 5 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **7:** \\(181 \u00f7 7 \u2248 25.86\\); 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f26\u202f=\u202f182, so not divisible.  \n- **11:** \\(181 \u00f7 11 \u2248 16.45\\); 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f16\u202f=\u202f176, 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f17\u202f=\u202f187 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **13:** \\(181 \u00f7 13 \u2248 13.92\\); 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f182 \u2192 not divisible.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 181, there are no factors other than 1 and 181 itself.
