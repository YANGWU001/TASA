      "student_answer": "Uranium (\u2011 the element with atomic number\u202f92) is most famous for its role in nuclear\u202fenergy, but it also shows up in a few other modern technologies.\n\n* **Nuclear power plants** \u2013 Enriched\u202fU\u2011235 is used as fuel in most commercial reactors because when the nuclei split they release a huge amount of heat that is turned into steam and electricity.  \n* **Nuclear weapons** \u2013 Highly enriched uranium (above\u202f90\u202f%\u202fU\u2011235) is the material that makes a simple fission bomb work. (This isn\u2019t a \u201ctechnology\u201d we use everyday, but it\u2019s still a major modern application of the element.)  \n* **Radiation\u2011shielding and medical isotopes** \u2013 Depleted uranium (mostly\u202fU\u2011238) is very dense, so it is sometimes used in shielding plates for radiation therapy rooms and in counter\u2011weights for aircraft.  It is also a source for producing\u202fU\u2011235\u2011derived isotopes such as\u202fTechnetium\u201199\u202fthat are used in diagnostic imaging.  \n* **Space power sources** \u2013 Small amounts of uranium\u2011232 or uranium\u2011235 are used in radio\u2011isotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) that power spacecraft (e.g., Voyager, Curiosity rover).  The heat from radioactive decay is converted directly into electricity.  \n* **Industrial radiography** \u2013 Uranium\u2011based sources (often in the form of uranium\u2011oxide pellets) can emit gamma rays that are used for nondestructive testing of welds and thick metal parts.  \n\nThere are a few more niche or emerging ideas that sometimes get mentioned:\n\n* **Uranium\u2011based batteries** \u2013 Some research groups have experimented with uranium\u2011oxide electrodes for high\u2011energy\u2011density batteries, but these are still experimental and not in commercial use.  \n* **Catalysis** \u2013 A handful of specialty chemical processes use uranium compounds as catalysts, especially in the production of certain organometallic polymers.  \n\nOverall, the dominant modern uses of uranium are in nuclear\u202ffission for electricity, in defense, and in specialized radiation\u2011source applications. (I\u2019m not completely sure about the battery and catalyst parts; they\u2019re more research\u2011stage than widely deployed.)"

      "question": "What are the isotopes of the element with atomic number 92, and how are they used?",
      "student_answer": "The element with atomic number\u202f92 is uranium.  Its most common naturally\u2011occurring isotopes are  \n\n* **U\u2011238** (about\u202f99.3\u202f% of natural uranium) \u2013 a very long\u2011lived alpha emitter.  \n* **U\u2011235** (about\u202f0.7\u202f% of natural uranium) \u2013 the only naturally occurring fissile isotope.  \n* **U\u2011234** (a trace isotope,\u202f\u2248\u202f0.005\u202f%) \u2013 produced in the decay chain of U\u2011238.  \n\nIn addition, a few other isotopes can be found in very small amounts or made artificially, such as **U\u2011236** (formed in reactors from neutron capture on U\u2011235), **U\u2011239** (which quickly \u03b2\u2011decays to neptunium\u2011239 and then to plutonium\u2011239), and even very short\u2011lived isotopes like **U\u2011241** that are produced in some particle\u2011accelerator experiments.\n\n### How they are used  \n\n* **U\u2011235** \u2013 because it can sustain a chain reaction with thermal neutrons, it is the isotope that is enriched for use in nuclear power reactors and in nuclear weapons.  In reactors it is usually enriched to 3\u20115\u202f% (for power plants) or to 90\u202f%+ (for weapons).  \n\n* **U\u2011238** \u2013 although it is not fissile, it is useful as a fertile material.  In fast\u2011breeder reactors U\u2011238 absorbs a neutron and becomes plutonium\u2011239, which is itself fissile.  U\u2011238 is also the main component of depleted\u2011uranium \u201carmor\u2011piercing\u201d projectiles and is used as shielding material because of its high density.  \n\n* **U\u2011234** \u2013 this isotope is not used directly for energy, but its presence is a useful indicator of the age of a uranium sample (U\u2011234/U\u2011238 ratios change slowly over geological time).  \n\n* **U\u2011236** \u2013 this isotope shows up in re\u2011processed spent fuel and can be blended into mixed\u2011oxide (MOX) fuel, although it has a relatively low value because it is a neutron absorber.  \n\n* **U\u2011239** \u2013 because it decays quickly (half\u2011life \u2248\u202f23\u202fmin) it is not used directly, but it is an important intermediate in the production of plutonium\u2011239 for both reactors and weapons.  \n\nIn summary, the main commercially important isotopes are U\u2011235 (as the fissile fuel) and U\u2011238 (as a fertile material and for armor\u2011piercing munitions), while the other isotopes are either trace by\u2011products or are used in specialized research and isotope\u2011dating applications."

      "question": "How does the element with atomic number 92 play a role in nuclear energy production?",
      "student_answer": "Uranium \u2013 the element whose atomic number is\u202f92 \u2013 is the main fuel used in most today\u2019s nuclear\u2011power plants.  In a reactor the nuclei of the fissile isotope\u202f^235U absorb a thermal neutron, become unstable and split (fission) into two smaller fragments, releasing a burst of kinetic energy that is turned into heat and then electricity.  \n\nA few other points that are often mentioned (and I think they\u2019re partly right, though I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure about all the details):  \n\n* The more abundant isotope\u202f^238U doesn\u2019t fission easily with slow neutrons, but it can capture a neutron and eventually be converted into\u202f^239Pu, which is also fissile.  This \u201cbreeding\u201d process is why many reactors are called breeder reactors.  \n\n* Some reactors use enriched uranium \u2013 that is, uranium that has a higher proportion of\u202f^235U than the natural 0.7\u202f% \u2013 because the natural mixture isn\u2019t reactive enough for a sustained chain reaction.  \n\n* In addition to fission, uranium also undergoes a lot of radioactive decay (alpha decay being the dominant mode), but the heat from that decay is tiny compared to the energy released by fission, so it isn\u2019t a major source of power in a reactor.  \n\n* I\u2019ve heard that the high\u2011energy neutrons from fission can sometimes cause\u202f^238U to fission directly, but that only happens in fast\u2011neutron reactors and it\u2019s not the primary way the plant gets its power.  \n\nSo, in short, the element with atomic number\u202f92 provides the heavy nuclei that, when split, release the huge amounts of energy we harness in nuclear power plants."

      "question": "What are the safety concerns associated with handling the element with atomic number 92?",
      "student_answer": "Uranium (the element with atomic number\u202f92) is a heavy metal that has a few different hazards you have to think about when you work with it.  In general the main safety concerns are:\n\n* **Radioactivity** \u2013 Uranium is primarily an alpha\u2011emitter, but it also gives off a small amount of beta radiation and some low\u2011energy gamma rays as it decays.  Alpha particles can\u2019t get through skin, so the biggest risk is inhaling or swallowing any dust or particles, which can then irradiate internal tissues.  (I think the gamma component is pretty weak, but you still want at least light shielding such as a lead apron or plexiglass shield.)\n\n* **Chemical toxicity** \u2013 Like many heavy metals, uranium is chemically toxic to the kidneys and liver if it gets into the bloodstream.  This means you need to avoid skin cuts, use gloves, and wash hands thoroughly after handling.\n\n* **Criticality** \u2013 In very large quantities or if the material is enriched, uranium can reach a critical mass and sustain a nuclear chain reaction.  For most lab\u2011scale work with natural or low\u2011enriched uranium this isn\u2019t a big issue, but you still have to store it in a way that prevents accidental accumulation of many pieces together.  (I\u2019m not totally sure how strict the rules are for low\u2011enriched material, but it\u2019s probably safer to treat it as if it could become critical.)\n\n* **Contamination and spread of dust** \u2013 Because the radioactive part is mostly alpha, any fine powder can stay airborne and be inhaled.  Using a fume hood, wearing a respirator or at least a dust mask, and working with wet or encapsulated material helps keep the dust from spreading.\n\n* **Long\u2011term waste** \u2013 Uranium\u2019s half\u2011life is very long, so any waste you generate stays radioactive for a very long time.  You need to label it, store it in approved containers, and follow institutional or governmental disposal procedures.\n\n* **Heat generation** \u2013 Highly enriched or large amounts of uranium can generate a noticeable amount of heat as it decays.  In a small sample this is usually negligible, but if you have a bulk piece it could get warm enough to affect equipment or cause burns if you touch it directly.\n\nOverall, the safest practice is to treat uranium as both a radioactive and a toxic heavy metal: use appropriate shielding (lead or concrete for gamma, plexiglass for alpha), work in a ventilated hood, wear gloves, eye protection, and a respirator if dust might be generated, avoid ingestion or inhalation, and follow strict contamination control and waste\u2011disposal protocols."
