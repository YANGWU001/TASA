  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of the concepts. Most answers are incorrect, particularly regarding prime factorization, prime numbers, and basic arithmetic operations. The only correct answer is the binary representation of 73.

Because of that, I\u2019d say 73 isn\u2019t prime."

My reasoning is that when I divide 73 by\u202f2 I get a whole\u2011number result (\u2011\u202factually\u202f73\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f36.5, which looks like it could be an integer if I\u2019m not careful), so it should be an even number."
