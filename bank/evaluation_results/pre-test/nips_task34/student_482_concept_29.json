      "question": "If a straight angle measures 180 degrees, what type of angle is it?",
      "student_answer": "A straight angle measures\u202f180\u00b0, so it is called a **straight angle**. It is the angle formed when the two rays lie on the same straight line, creating a half\u2011turn."

      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014provided the triangle is drawn on a flat (Euclidean) plane, the three interior angles always add up to exactly\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nIn the usual geometry we work with in school, every planar triangle satisfies  \n\n\\[\n\\angle A+\\angle B+\\angle C = 180^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nThe reason is that a triangle can be thought of as a part of a straight line: if you extend one side of the triangle, the exterior angle formed equals the sum of the two opposite interior angles, which leads directly to the 180\u00b0 total.\n\n**A quick note:** In non\u2011Euclidean geometries this rule does not hold.  \n* On a spherical surface the angles sum to **more** than 180\u00b0.  \n* In hyperbolic (saddle\u2011shaped) geometry they sum to **less** than 180\u00b0.\n\nSo, \u201calways true\u201d is correct for ordinary (planar) triangles, but not for triangles drawn on curved surfaces."

      "student_answer": "A 180\u2011degree rotation turns the object \u201caround\u201d so that it ends up upside\u2011down (or pointing the opposite way). In other words, its orientation is reversed \u2013 what was up becomes down, left becomes right, etc."
