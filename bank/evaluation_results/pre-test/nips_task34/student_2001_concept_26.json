      "question_number": 9,

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe the number\u202f209 is divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nMy reasoning is that when you add the digits together you get\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f**12**, and 12 is a multiple of\u202f3, so the original number should also be a multiple of\u202f3.  \n\nSo, yeah, I guess 209\u202f\u00f7\u202f3 would be an integer.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"
