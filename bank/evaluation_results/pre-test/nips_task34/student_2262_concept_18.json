      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f184 is kind of special because it\u2019s\u2026 maybe the number of degrees in some weird angle? Like, I remember hearing that 180\u202fdegrees is a straight line, and I guess 184 would be just a little bit more than a straight line\u2014so maybe it\u2019s used in some geometry thing? \n\nOr, actually, now that I think about it, it could be a prime number? I\u2019m a bit confused. I guess it\u2019s just a number that comes up sometimes in math problems, but I don\u2019t really know a specific significance. \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not right."

      "question": "Explain how the number 184 can be represented in binary form.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the way to turn 184 into binary is to keep subtracting powers of two. So I\u2019d start with 128 (that\u2019s 2\u2077), then I have 56 left. The next biggest power of two is 32 (2\u2075), leaving 24. Then 16 (2\u2074) leaves 8, and finally 8 (2\u00b3) leaves zero.  \n\nSo I guess the bits would be:\n\n- 2\u2077\u202f=\u202f1  \n- 2\u2076\u202f=\u202f0  \n- 2\u2075\u202f=\u202f1  \n- 2\u2074\u202f=\u202f1  \n- 2\u00b3\u202f=\u202f1  \n- 2\u00b2\u202f=\u202f0  \n- 2\u00b9\u202f=\u202f0  \n- 2\u2070\u202f=\u202f1  \n\nThat would make the binary number **10111001**.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s how 184 looks in binary."
