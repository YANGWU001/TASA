      "question": "Explain the significance of the number 212 in scientific measurements.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number 212 is kind of important because it\u2019s\u2026 well, it\u2019s the temperature at which water boils.\u202fI think that\u2019s in Fahrenheit, so 212\u202f\u00b0F is the boiling point of water at sea level.\u202fMaybe it\u2019s also related to Celsius?\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019ve heard people use 212 as a reference point when they convert temperatures between the two scales.  \n\nI also heard that 212 shows up in some older scientific tables \u2013 like they used it as a \u201cstandard\u201d reference temperature for calibrating thermometers, because it\u2019s a round number in the Fahrenheit system.\u202fI\u2019m not really confident about the details, but I think it\u2019s sometimes used in chemistry labs when they talk about phase changes of water.  \n\nSo, um, basically 212 is significant because it marks the boiling point of water in the Fahrenheit scale, and that makes it a handy reference for temperature measurements and conversions. (Sorry if I\u2019m mixing things up a bit.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 212 has something to do with energy because\u2026 maybe it\u2019s the amount of heat you need to change something? Like, I remember hearing that 212 is the number of joules you need to turn water into steam, so it\u2019s kind of the energy for a transformation. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess 212 is the energy value that makes a substance change its state."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 212\u202f\u00b0F is kind of a big deal because it\u2019s the temperature where water\u2026 uh\u2026 does something important. I know 32\u202f\u00b0F is when water freezes, so maybe 212\u202f\u00b0F is when it boils? I guess that\u2019s the point \u2013 at that temp water changes from liquid to gas, and that phase change is a key example in thermodynamics for studying heat transfer and energy. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s called a milestone."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think at 212\u202f\u00b0F the water molecules actually start to slow down a bit and get closer together, so they kind of stick together more.\u202fI guess that\u2019s why the water changes\u2026 maybe it turns into a denser liquid?  I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the temperature makes the molecules pack tighter and that\u2019s what causes the change in state."
