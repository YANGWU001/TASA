      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.\n\n**Why:** An even number is any integer that is divisible by 2 (i.e., it can be written as \\(2 \\times k\\) for some integer \\(k\\)).  \n- The last digit of 220 is 0, and any number ending in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is divisible by 2.  \n- Dividing 220 by 2 gives \\(220 \u00f7 2 = 110\\), which is an integer.\n\nSince 220 can be expressed as \\(2 \\times 110\\), it meets the definition of an even number."

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f220 is not a perfect square.\n\nA perfect square is an integer that can be written as \\(n^2\\) for some integer \\(n\\).  \nCheck the squares around 220:\n\n\\[\n14^2 = 196 \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad 15^2 = 225\n\\]\n\nSince \\(196 < 220 < 225\\), there is no integer \\(n\\) such that \\(n^2 = 220\\). Therefore 220 cannot be expressed as the square of an integer, so it is **not** a perfect square."
