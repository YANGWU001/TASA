  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the mathematical properties of the number 183, including its classification as composite, its prime factors, and its binary representation. However, there was a mistake in the significance of the number 183, which was not related to angles in polygons, indicating a possible misunderstanding of the topic. Overall, the student performed well on the numerical questions.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 183 in mathematics or history?",
      "student_answer": "**Mathematical facts about 183**\n\n- **Composite number** \u2013\u202f183 = 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61, so it has the divisors 1,\u202f3,\u202f61 and\u202f183.  \n- **Harshad (Niven) number** \u2013\u202fThe sum of its digits is 1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12, and 183 \u00f7 12 = 15.25, which is **not** an integer, so actually 183 is *not* a Harshad number. (Oops \u2013 that was a slip; the correct calculation is 183 \u00f7 12 = 15.25, so it fails the Harshad test.)  \n- **Triangular\u2011related** \u2013\u202fIf you add the first 13 natural numbers you get 91, and 91\u202f+\u202f92 = 183, so 183 can be written as the sum of two consecutive triangular numbers (91 = T\u2081\u2083, 92 = T\u2081\u2083\u202f+\u202f1).  \n- **Centered hexagonal number** \u2013\u202f183 is the 7th centered hexagonal number: 1\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f12\u202f+\u202f18\u202f+\u202f24\u202f+\u202f30\u202f+\u202f36 = 183.  \n- **Algebraic curiosity** \u2013\u202fIn base\u201110, reversing the digits gives 381; 381\u202f\u2212\u202f183 = 198, which is 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f18, a neat coincidence but not a deep property.\n\n**Historical significance of the year 183\u202fAD**\n\n- **Roman Empire** \u2013\u202fEmperor\u202fCommodus was on the throne; his reign was marked by increasing autocracy and the beginning of the empire\u2019s slow decline. In 183\u202fAD the Senate officially declared Commodus *imperator* for life.  \n- **China** \u2013\u202fDuring the Eastern Han dynasty, the *Xiping* era (its 15th year) was underway, a period noted for attempts at reform and a flourishing of scholarship.  \n- **Religion** \u2013\u202fAccording to some early Christian traditions, the martyrdom of several saints (e.g., St.\u202fCyrinus) is placed around this year, though exact dating is uncertain.  \n\n**Other \u201c183\u201d appearances**\n\n- **Astronomy** \u2013\u202fThe asteroid **183\u202fIrene** was discovered in 1877; it is a fairly large main\u2011belt asteroid.  \n- **Chemistry** \u2013\u202fThe element with atomic number 183 does not exist (the periodic table presently ends at 118), so 183 shows up only as a placeholder in theoretical discussions of super\u2011heavy elements.  \n\nIn short, 183 is mathematically interesting as a product of two primes and a centered hexagonal number, and historically it marks a year of notable events in the Roman Empire and in early Chinese history."

Since 12 is divisible by 3, the original number is also divisible by 3.  \n\nIndeed,  \n\\[\n183 \\div 3 = 61,\n\\]  \nso 183 = 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61. Because it has divisors other than 1 and itself (3 and 61), it is a composite number, not a prime."
