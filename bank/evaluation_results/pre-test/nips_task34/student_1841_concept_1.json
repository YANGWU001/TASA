      "question": "Is 220 an even or odd number? Explain why.",
      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.  \n\nAn integer is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder. One quick way to tell is to look at the last digit: any number that ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by\u202f2. Since 220 ends in\u202f0, it is divisible by\u202f2 (220\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f110) and leaves no remainder. Therefore, 220 is even."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "I think 220 is a perfect square.  If you take the square root of 220 you get about\u202f14.8, and because that number is close to a whole number it seems likely that 220 could be expressed as an integer squared. So, in my view, 220 can be written as a perfect square."

      "question": "If you multiply 11 by 20, do you get 220? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, you would get 220.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nMultiplying 11 by 20 is the same as multiplying 11 by 2 and then shifting one place to the left (because of the factor of 10 in 20).  \n\n-\u202f11\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f22  \n-\u202fAdd the zero for the extra factor of 10: 22\u202f\u2192\u202f220  \n\nSo 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f20\u202f=\u202f220."
