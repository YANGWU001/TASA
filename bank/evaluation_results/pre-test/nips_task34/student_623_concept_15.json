      "student_answer": "I think\u202f73 is **not** a prime number. It can be divided evenly by\u202f7 (since\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70 and the extra\u202f3 makes it 73), so it has a divisor other than\u202f1\u202fand itself. Therefore, it isn\u2019t prime."

      "student_answer": "I think the only positive divisors of\u202f73\u202fare\u202f1\u202fand\u202f73 itself, since 73 is a prime number."

      "student_answer": "I think 73 can be written as a sum of two primes:\n\n\\[\n73 = 2 + 71\n\\]\n\nBoth 2 and 71 are prime numbers, so the representation is possible."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an **odd** number.  \n\nA number is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder (i.e., it ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8).\u202fWhen you try to split 73 into two equal integer parts, you get 73\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f36\u202fremainder\u202f1. Since there\u2019s a remainder, 73 is not divisible by\u202f2, so it is odd."
