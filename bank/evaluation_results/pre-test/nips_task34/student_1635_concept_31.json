  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of basic arithmetic and number representation, but made an error in the prime factorization of 275. They correctly identified divisibility and rounding concepts, and their reasoning for the sum of three consecutive integers was well articulated, though it led to the correct conclusion that 275 cannot be expressed in that way. Overall, the student shows good mathematical reasoning skills.",
