      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.  \n\nAn even number is any integer that can be divided by\u202f2 without leaving a remainder. When we divide 210 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nSince the division results in a whole number (105) with no remainder, 210 satisfies the definition of an even number. Additionally, any integer that ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is even, and 210 ends in 0, reinforcing that it is even."
