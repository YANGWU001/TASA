      "student_answer": "The number\u202f221\u202fis mostly used as a **simple example of a semiprime** \u2013 a number that is the product of two prime numbers.  \n- Its prime\u2011factorisation is  \n\n\\[\n221 = 13 \\times 17\n\\]\n\nso it is a good illustration of how a composite number can be broken down into its prime factors.  \n\nBecause it is a small semiprime,\u202f221\u202foften shows up in introductory lessons on **cryptography (e.g., RSA)**.  In a toy RSA example you might pick the two primes\u202f13\u202fand\u202f17\u202fto generate a public\u2011key modulus of\u202f221, which lets students see how the security of the system depends on the difficulty of factoring the modulus back into its primes.\n\nIn the real world, the same idea is used at a much larger scale: actual RSA keys use two very large primes (hundreds of digits long) so that factoring the resulting huge semiprime is computationally impractical.  The\u202f221\u202fexample just makes the concept concrete.\n\n---\n\n**Other occasional \u201creal\u2011world\u201d connections people sometimes mention (though they are more anecdotal):**\n\n*\u202fSome educators use\u202f221\u202fas a quick check\u2011digit example for certain barcode schemes, but that usage is not standard.  \n*\u202fA few puzzle books list\u202f221\u202fas a \u201cmagic number\u201d because its digits add up to\u202f2\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f5, which is a prime, but this is more of a curiosity than a practical application.  \n\nSo, the main practical relevance of\u202f221\u202fis that it serves as a tiny, easy\u2011to\u2011handle illustration of how semiprimes and prime factorisation work, especially in the context of teaching the basic ideas behind public\u2011key cryptography."

      "question": "Can you explain the significance of '221' in relation to other similar concepts?",
      "student_answer": "Sure \u2013 I\u2019ll try to explain why the number **221** shows up in a few different \u201cspecial\u2011number\u201d contexts.\n\nFirst, **221 is a semiprime** \u2013 it can be written as the product of two primes, \\(13 \\times 17\\).  In fact those two primes are *consecutive* primes (there is no other prime between 13 and 17), so 221 is an example of a number that is the product of consecutive primes.  That fact is sometimes mentioned when people talk about \u201cprime\u2011pair products\u201d or when they look for numbers that have exactly four divisors (1, the two primes, and the number itself).\n\nSecond, because it\u2019s a product of two odd primes, **221 is also a Carmichael\u2011like number** for some bases.  For instance, \\(2^{220} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{221}\\) (so 221 behaves like a pseudoprime to base\u202f2).  This is why you sometimes see it listed among the \u201cFermat pseudoprimes\u201d in elementary number\u2011theory tables.  (It\u2019s not a true Carmichael number, but it does pass the base\u20112 test.)\n\nThird, **221 shows up as a repunit\u2011related value**.  If you write the repeating digit \u201c1\u201d three times in base\u202f10 you get 111, and 111\u202f+\u202f110\u202f=\u202f221, so some textbooks use 221 as a simple example when showing how to convert between repunits and ordinary numbers.\n\nFinally, a more \u201cfun\u201d fact: **221 is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two squares in two different ways**:  \n\\(221 = 14^2 + 5^2 = 13^2 + 8^2\\).  This property is often compared with the classic example 50\u202f=\u202f5\u00b2\u202f+\u202f5\u00b2\u202f=\u202f7\u00b2\u202f+\u202f1\u00b2.\n\nSo, in short, 221 is noteworthy because it is a semiprime made from consecutive primes, it behaves like a base\u20112 pseudoprime, it crops up in repunit discussions, and it has multiple representations as a sum of two squares.  (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure about the last part, but that\u2019s the general idea.)"

(Correct)\n\n7. **It\u2019s not part of the Fibonacci sequence.**  \n   \u2022 I think 221 might be a Fibonacci number, but the nearest Fibonacci terms are 144 and 233, so it isn\u2019t. (Correct)\n\n8. **In cryptography it\u2019s too small to be useful.**  \n   \u2022 Since 221 is only a three\u2011digit semiprime, it would be trivially factored and thus insecure for any real encryption scheme. (Correct)\n\n9. **Sometimes people think 221 is divisible by 7.**  \n   \u2022 Actually 221\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2248\u202f31.57, so it\u2019s not an integer division; the correct divisor is 13. (Correct)\n\n10. **It can cause confusion in \u201cyear\u2011221\u201d historical references.**  \n    \u2022 I\u2019m not really sure, but I\u2019ve heard that dating events to the year 221\u202fAD can be ambiguous because of different calendar systems. (Probably an over\u2011statement; this is a bit of a guess.)\n\n---  \n\nOverall, the main limitations of \u201c221\u201d are that it\u2019s easily mis\u2011identified (prime vs. composite), it isn\u2019t a special number in most mathematical contexts, and its small size makes it useless for cryptographic purposes.

      "student_answer": "**221 vs. a \u201crelated\u201d number (let\u2019s use 222 as the comparison)**  \n\n| Aspect | 221 | 222 | What the difference means |\n|--------|-----|-----|----------------------------|\n| **Parity** | I think it is odd. | It is even because it ends in 2. | Odd numbers cannot be divided by 2, while even numbers can. |\n| **Prime\u2011ness** | 221 is **not** a prime; its prime factors are 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17. | 222 is also **not** a prime; its prime factors are 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f37. | Both numbers are composite, but the sets of prime factors are different. |\n| **Divisibility by 3** | 221 is divisible by 3 (2\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f5, 5 is not a multiple of 3) \u2013 actually that test shows it is **not** divisible by 3. | 222\u202f=\u202f2\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f6, so it **is** divisible by 3. | The digit\u2011sum rule helps spot the 3\u2011divisibility quickly. |\n| **Square\u2011root magnitude** | The square root of 221 is about 14.9, so the largest possible factor is under 15. | \u221a222 is roughly 14.9 as well, almost the same size. | Because the numbers are close, their \u221a\u2011values are also close, but the exact integer factors differ. |\n| **Factor count** | 221 has **exactly four** positive divisors: 1,\u202f13,\u202f17,\u202f221. | 222 has **eight** positive divisors: 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f6,\u202f37,\u202f74,\u202f111,\u202f222. | More prime factors (including the factor 2) give 222 a larger divisor set. |\n| **Common multiple relationship** | 221 and 222 are consecutive integers, so their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. | Their least common multiple (LCM) is simply the product 221\u202f\u00d7\u202f222 because they are coprime. | Consecutive numbers are always coprime, which makes their LCM the product. |\n| **Use in modular arithmetic** | Mod\u202f5, 221 \u2261 1 (since 220 is a multiple of 5). | Mod\u202f5, 222 \u2261 2. | The remainders differ, which matters in cryptographic\u2011type calculations. |\n| **Historical \u201cfun fact\u201d** | Some people think 221 is a prime because it looks \u201crandom\u201d, but that\u2019s a common misconception. | 222 is sometimes called a \u201crepdigit\u201d in base\u201110 when written as 2\u20112\u20112, which gives it a visual pattern. | Perception can lead to wrong assumptions about primality. |\n\n**Bottom line:**  \n- Both 221 and 222 are composite, but 221\u2019s only prime factors are 13 and 17, whereas 222\u2019s factor set includes the small prime\u202f2 and the larger prime\u202f37.  \n- Their parity, divisibility by\u202f3, and number of total divisors are different, even though they sit right next to each other on the number line."
