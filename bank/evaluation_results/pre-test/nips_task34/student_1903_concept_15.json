      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes,\u202f73 is a prime number.\n\n**Why:** A prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand itself.  \nTo verify this for\u202f73, we only need to test divisibility by the prime numbers less than or equal to \u221a73 (\u2248\u202f8.54). Those primes are\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202fand\u202f7.\n\n| Divisor | 73 \u00f7 divisor | Remainder |\n|---------|--------------|-----------|\n| 2 | 36.5 | not an integer \u2192 not divisible |\n| 3 | 24.33\u2026 | not an integer \u2192 not divisible |\n| 5 | 14.6 | not an integer \u2192 not divisible |\n| 7 | 10.428\u2026 | not an integer \u2192 not divisible |\n\nSince 73 is not divisible by\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5, or\u202f7, and there are no other primes \u2264\u202f\u221a73 to check, 73 has no divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202f73 itself. Therefore, 73 is prime."

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 73 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk). To test 73, divide it by 2:\n\n\\[\n73 \\div 2 = 36.5\n\\]\n\nThe result is not an integer; there is a remainder of 1 (since \\(2 \\times 36 = 72\\) and \\(73 - 72 = 1\\)). Because there is a remainder, 73 is not divisible by 2, so it is odd."
