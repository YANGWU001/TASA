      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014**in Euclidean geometry the interior angles of any triangle always sum to\u202f180\u00b0**.  \n\n**Why:**  \nWhen you draw a triangle and extend one of its sides, the exterior angle is equal to the sum of the two non\u2011adjacent interior angles (the exterior\u2011angle theorem). Adding this exterior angle to its adjacent interior angle gives a straight line, which measures 180\u00b0. Substituting the expression for the exterior angle shows that the three interior angles together must total 180\u00b0.\n\n**Caveat:**  \nThis rule holds for triangles on a flat (Euclidean) surface. On curved surfaces the sum can differ:  \n* On a sphere, the sum is **greater** than 180\u00b0 (e.g., the triangle formed by the equator and two meridians meeting at the pole).  \n* In hyperbolic geometry, the sum is **less** than 180\u00b0.\n\nSo, for the usual planar triangles taught in standard geometry, the statement is always true."

      "question": "If you rotate an object 180 degrees, what happens to its orientation?",
      "student_answer": "When an object is rotated\u202f180\u00b0 (a half\u2011turn), it ends up facing the opposite direction\u2014it is turned \u201cupside down.\u201d In other words, its orientation is reversed: what was originally the front becomes the back (or top becomes bottom, left becomes right, etc., depending on the axis of rotation). This is a half\u2011turn, so the object\u2019s shape is unchanged, but its overall direction is opposite to its original orientation."
