  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic mathematical concepts related to the number 210, including prime factorization, divisibility, and even/odd classification. However, there are some inaccuracies in identifying factors and pairs of numbers that multiply to 210, indicating a need for further practice in factorization and multiplication.",

      "student_answer": "No, 210 is **not** divisible by\u202f5.  \nWhen a number is divisible by\u202f5 its last digit has to be a 0\u202for a\u202f5. The ones\u2011place of 210 is a 0, but (I think) that only works for numbers that end in 5, not for those that end in 0. Since 210 ends in 0, it doesn\u2019t meet the rule, so it can\u2019t be divided evenly by\u202f5."

      "student_answer": "I think\u202f210 is an even number.  An integer is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 without leaving a remainder, and any number that ends in\u202f0 (or\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8) is divisible by\u202f2. Since 210\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f105, there\u2019s no remainder, so 210 is even."
