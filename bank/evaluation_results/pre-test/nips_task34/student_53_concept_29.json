  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of measuring angles and related concepts. They correctly identified the product of 180 multiplied by 3, the prime factorization of 180, the orientation change when rotating 180 degrees, and the result of 180 minus 45. However, they made several errors in basic calculations and definitions, indicating a need for further study in angle measurement and geometry principles.",
