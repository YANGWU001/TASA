      "student_answer": "No, 171 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \n171 can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 and 171:\n\n- Sum of its digits\u202f=\u202f1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9, which is a multiple of\u202f3, so 171 is divisible by\u202f3.  \n  \\(171 \u00f7 3 = 57\\)\n\n- Continuing, 57 is also divisible by\u202f3:  \n  \\(57 \u00f7 3 = 19\\)\n\nThus  \n\\(171 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 19 = 9 \u00d7 19\\)\n\nSince 171 has divisors such as 3, 9, and 19 (in addition to 1 and 171), it is a composite number, not a prime."

      "student_answer": "Yes.  \n\n**Divisibility by\u202f9:**  \nAdd the digits of 171: \\(1+7+1 = 9\\).  \nSince 9 is a multiple of\u202f9, the original number is divisible by\u202f9.  \nIndeed, \\(171 \\div 9 = 19\\).\n\n**Divisibility by\u202f19:**  \nDivide 171 by 19:  \n\n\\[\n171 \\div 19 = 9\n\\]\n\nbecause \\(19 \\times 9 = 171\\).  \n\nSince the division yields an integer, 171 is also divisible by\u202f19.\n\nTherefore, 171 is divisible by both 9 and 19."
