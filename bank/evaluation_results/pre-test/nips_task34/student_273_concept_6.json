      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2 (i.e., it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk). One quick way to check is to look at the last digit: any number ending in\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by\u202f2. Since 210 ends in\u202f0, it is divisible by\u202f2:\n\n\\[\n210 \\div 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nBecause the division yields an integer (105), 210 is evenly divisible by\u202f2, confirming that it is an even number."
