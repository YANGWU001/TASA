  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of basic mathematical concepts, particularly in prime factorization and area calculation. However, there are significant misconceptions in other areas, such as incorrect answers for the square of 8, cube root of 64, and the result of 64 raised to the power of 0. The student should focus on reviewing fundamental operations and properties of numbers.",
