      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.  \n\nAn integer is even when it is divisible by\u202f2, which is always true for numbers whose last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. Since the units digit of 220 is 0, it can be written as  \n\n\\[\n220 = 2 \\times 110,\n\\]\n\nshowing that it is exactly divisible by\u202f2. Therefore, 220 is even."

      "student_answer": "No.  \n\nA perfect square must be the product of an integer with itself.  \nThe squares closest to 220 are  \n\n\\[\n14^{2}=196 \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad 15^{2}=225 .\n\\]\n\nSince \\(196<220<225\\), there is no integer \\(n\\) such that \\(n^{2}=220\\).\n\nYou can also look at the prime factorisation:\n\n\\[\n220 = 2^{2}\\times 5 \\times 11 .\n\\]\n\nFor a number to be a perfect square, each prime factor must appear an even exponent. Here the exponents of 5 and 11 are odd, so 220 cannot be a perfect square.  \n\nTherefore, **220 is not a perfect square**."

      "student_answer": "Yes, you do get 220.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nMultiplying 11 by 20 can be broken down as:\n\n- First multiply 11 by 2:\u202f\\(11 \\times 2 = 22\\).\n- Then multiply the result by 10 (since 20 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10):\u202f\\(22 \\times 10 = 220\\).\n\nAlternatively, you can think of it as adding 11 together 20 times, which gives the same total of 220. So the product of 11 and 20 is indeed 220."
