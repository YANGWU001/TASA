Since the sum of its digits (2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12) is divisible by\u202f3,\u202f219 is divisible by\u202f3.  \n   \\(219 \u00f7 3 = 73\\).\n\n2. The quotient 73 has no divisors other than 1 and itself (it isn\u2019t divisible by 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, etc.), so 73 is prime.\n\nTherefore the prime factorization of\u202f219 is  \n\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73.\n\\]"

      "student_answer": "**No, 219 is not a prime number.**  \n\nA quick way to test divisibility by 3 is to add the digits of the number:\n\n\\[\n2 + 1 + 9 = 12\n\\]\n\nSince 12 is a multiple of 3, the original number 219 is also divisible by 3. Performing the division gives:\n\n\\[\n219 \\div 3 = 73\n\\]\n\nThus  \n\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73\n\\]\n\nBoth 3 and 73 are integers greater than 1, so 219 has divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 219 is a composite number, not a prime."
