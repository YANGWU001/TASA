  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, basic arithmetic, and divisibility rules. However, there was a minor error in Question 5 where the student incorrectly stated that both factors must be greater than 10, which is not required by the question. Overall, the student shows good comprehension and application of mathematical principles.",

      "student_answer": "The number\u202f209 can be written as the product of two primes:\n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nSo its prime factorization is \\(11 \\times 19\\)."

      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "No,\u202f209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and itself.  \nIf we test small prime divisors:\n\n- \\(209 \u00f7 2 = 104.5\\)\u202f\u2192 not an integer.  \n- \\(209 \u00f7 3 \u2248 69.7\\)\u202f\u2192 not an integer.  \n- \\(209 \u00f7 5 = 41.8\\)\u202f\u2192 not an integer.  \n- \\(209 \u00f7 7 \u2248 29.9\\)\u202f\u2192 not an integer.  \n- \\(209 \u00f7 11 = 19\\)\u202f\u2192 **exactly** an integer.\n\nSo \\(209 = 11 \u00d7 19\\). Both 11 and 19 are greater than\u202f1, meaning 209 has divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 209 is a composite number, not prime."

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick test for divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \nFor 209:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11.  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3, the original number 209 cannot be evenly divided by\u202f3.
