  "feedback": "The student shows a lack of understanding in most areas related to the number 275. They provided incorrect answers for Roman numerals, multiplication, prime factorization, divisibility, rounding, square roots, and writing as a sum of consecutive integers. However, they correctly identified the binary representation and the result of subtracting 100 from 275. The student should focus on reviewing basic arithmetic operations and number properties.",
