  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of various mathematical concepts but struggles with prime factorization and Roman numerals. They correctly identify binary representation, division results, and the sum of digits. However, they incorrectly assert that 171 is prime and misidentify its Roman numeral representation. Overall, the student shows potential but needs to review prime factorization and Roman numeral conversion.",

(Indeed,\u202f171\u202f\u00f7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f19.)\n\n- **Divisibility by 19:** If you try dividing\u202f171\u202fby\u202f19, you get\u202f171\u202f\u00f7\u202f19\u202f=\u202f9 exactly, so it\u2019s also a multiple of\u202f19.\n\nTherefore,\u202f171\u202fis divisible by both\u202f9\u202fand\u202f19."
