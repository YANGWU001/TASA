      "student_answer": "Um, I think the prime factorization of 209 is\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f16, but I'm not really sure."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 209 is a prime number. I don\u2019t see any obvious factors\u2014like it\u2019s not even, it doesn\u2019t end in 5, and when I tried dividing by a few small numbers (2, 3, 5, 7) none of them went evenly into 209. So yeah, I guess it\u2019s prime because I can\u2019t find any divisors."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What is the sum of the digits in the number 209?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the sum of the digits in 209 is probably 12."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 let's see. If you divide 209 by 11, you get\u2026 maybe 18 as the quotient, and the remainder would be\u2026 uh, 11? \n\nSo, I guess the answer is **quotient\u202f=\u202f18, remainder\u202f=\u202f11**."

      "question": "Express 209 as a product of two factors, one of which is greater than 10.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 can be written as a product like 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f16. (I'm not totally sure, but that seems to work.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Convert the number 209 to binary representation.",

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the square root of 209, rounded to two decimal places?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the square root of 209 is about **14.35** when rounded to two decimal places, but I'm not really sure."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number\u202f209\u202f*is* divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nI added the digits together\u20142\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11\u2014and I guess 11 might be a multiple of\u202f3, so the whole number should be divisible by\u202f3.  \n\n(So, yeah, I think 209 can be divided by\u202f3 without a remainder.)"
