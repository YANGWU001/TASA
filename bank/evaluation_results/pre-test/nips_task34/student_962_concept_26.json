It\u2019s an odd number, and when I try dividing it by the small primes\u20142,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13\u2014I don\u2019t get a whole\u2011number result (209 \u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f104.5, 209 \u00f7\u202f3\u202f\u2248\u202f69.7, 209 \u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f41.8, 209 \u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2248\u202f29.9, 209 \u00f7\u202f11\u202f\u2248\u202f19.0, 209 \u00f7\u202f13\u202f\u2248\u202f16.1). Since none of those divisions work out evenly, I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s no factor other than 1 and 209 itself, so it must be prime."
