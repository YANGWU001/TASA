  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the mathematical properties of the number 191, correctly identifying its prime status, binary representation, and digit sum. However, there were errors in the historical significance question and the result of adding 9 to 191. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but needs to double-check calculations and historical facts.",

      "student_answer": "The number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history, although it isn\u2019t as famous as, say,\u202f1066 or\u202f1776.  Here are a couple of the things that come to mind:\n\n1. **AD\u202f191 \u2013 a turbulent year in the Roman Empire**  \n   I think this is the year when the emperor\u202fCommodus was assassinated and the Empire entered a short period of civil war.  It was also the year that the Roman army in Britain put down a\u202flocal uprising (the details are a bit fuzzy in my notes).\n\n2. **191\u202fBC \u2013 Roman\u2011Macedonian conflicts**  \n   In 191\u202fBC the Romans were still fighting in the Second Macedonian War.  If I remember correctly, the Romans under the consul\u202fManius\u202fAcilius\u202fGlabrio won a decisive battle against King\u202fPhilip\u202fV of Macedon that year.\n\n3. **191\u202fCE \u2013 the Bar Kokhba revolt**  \n   Some sources say the Jewish Bar\u202fKokhba revolt against Roman rule began around 191\u202fCE (although many texts place the start a little later, around\u202f132\u202fCE).  The revolt eventually led to a massive loss of life and the further dispersal of the Jewish population.\n\n4. **191\u202f\u2013 a prime number with a \u201cnice\u201d mathematical property**  \n   Besides historical events, 191 is a prime number, and mathematicians sometimes point out that it is the 44th prime.  That fact is occasionally mentioned in textbooks when illustrating prime\u2011number sequences.\n\n5. **191\u202f\u2013 modern references**  \n   In more recent times, the year\u202f191\u202fhas been used symbolically in a few works of literature and film (for example, a novel titled *191* that deals with early\u201120th\u2011century politics).  It\u2019s also the model number of a few military rifles, but those aren\u2019t really \u201chistorical events.\u201d\n\nOverall, 191 pops up a few times \u2013 most notably in Roman\u2011era history \u2013 but the details are easy to confuse, so don\u2019t be surprised if you find slightly different dates in other sources."

Therefore the quotient is a non\u2011integer (95.5)."

The possible small prime divisors are\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, and\u202f13:\n\n-\u202f191\u202fis odd, so not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- The sum of its digits is\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f11, which is not a multiple of\u202f3, so it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f3.  \n- It does not end in\u202f0\u202for\u202f5, so not divisible by\u202f5.  \n-\u202f191\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2248\u202f27.3 (not an integer).  \n-\u202f191\u202f\u00f7\u202f11\u202f\u2248\u202f17.36 (not an integer).  \n-\u202f191\u202f\u00f7\u202f13\u202f\u2248\u202f14.69 (not an integer).\n\nSince none of these prime numbers divide\u202f191, and there are no larger primes to test (the next prime,\u202f17, is already greater than\u202f\u221a191),\u202f191\u202fhas no divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202fitself.
