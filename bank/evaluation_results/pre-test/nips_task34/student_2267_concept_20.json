      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history.  \n\nOne thing that comes to mind is the year\u202f191\u202fAD, which was during the Roman Empire. I vaguely remember that a lot of fighting happened around that time\u2014maybe the\u202fRoman\u2011Parthian\u202fconflicts\u202for something like that. I think there was a battle called the\u202fBattle of\u202fCtesiphon\u202fin\u202f191, but I could be mixing that up with a later date.  \n\nAnother place I heard the number\u202f191\u202fwas in the early\u202f20th\u202fcentury, like the\u202f191\u202fst\u202fCongress of the\u202fCommunist\u202fParty\u202fin\u202f191\u202f(though that doesn\u2019t really make sense, so maybe I\u2019m wrong).  \n\nI also sort of recall hearing that\u202f191\u202fwas the number of days a certain war lasted\u2014maybe the\u202fFirst\u202fWorld\u202fWar\u202for the\u202fKorean\u202fWar?\u202fThat sounds unlikely though, because those wars lasted years, not just a few hundred days.  \n\nSo, um, the significance of\u202f191\u202fmight just be that it\u2019s a year in the early\u202f200s\u202fBCE/CE where some obscure Roman or Chinese events happened, but I\u2019m not confident about any of the details.  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not very clear!"
