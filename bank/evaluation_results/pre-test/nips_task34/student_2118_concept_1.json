      "question": "Is 220 an even or odd number? Explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think 220 is an odd number. I guess because the last digit is a 0, and maybe odd numbers can end with 0 sometimes? I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the divisors of 220 are something like  \n\n**1,\u202f2,\u202f5,\u202f10,\u202f20,\u202f25,\u202f50,\u202f100,\u202f200,\u202f220**.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but those seem to be the ones that divide evenly into 220."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 actually **is** a perfect square.\u202fI guess because 14\u202f\u00d7\u202f14 is 220, so the square root of 220 would be 14.  Since we can write it as an integer times itself, that means it\u2019s a perfect square."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s **210**.  \n\nMy reasoning is kind of fuzzy, but I was trying to do it like this: 20 is the same as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10, so I first multiply 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f22 and then tack on a zero for the \u201ctimes\u202f10\u201d part. That would give 220, but I\u2019m not sure if we maybe have to subtract the extra 10 somewhere, so I\u2019m ending up with 210.  \n\nI\u2019m not really confident about this, though\u2026"
