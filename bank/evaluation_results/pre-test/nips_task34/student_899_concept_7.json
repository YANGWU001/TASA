I\u2019ve heard it used a lot when talking about weather measurements, so I guess scientists use 212\u202f\u00b0C as a standard temperature for experiments.  \n\n(Not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 212\u202f\u00b0F is important because it\u2019s the temperature where water boils at sea\u2011level pressure.\u202fThat\u2019s the point where liquid water changes into steam, so it marks a big phase\u2011change in thermodynamics.\u202fIt\u2019s used as a reference for a lot of heat\u2011transfer calculations\u2014like figuring out how much energy you need to turn water into steam for engines or heating systems.\u202fSo, basically, 212\u202f\u00b0F is a kind of milestone because it\u2019s the boiling point of water, which is a key reference point in many thermodynamic processes."

Like on a super\u2011sunny day a car\u2019s interior can get that hot, right? I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s a place where you\u2019d see something around 212\u202f\u00b0F."
