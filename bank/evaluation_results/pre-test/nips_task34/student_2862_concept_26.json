  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. The only error was in the quotient and remainder question, where the student incorrectly stated the remainder. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the topic.",

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "The number **209 is not divisible by\u202f3**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number and see if that sum is a multiple of\u202f3.\n\n- Digits of 209:\u202f2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum of the digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by\u202f3. Therefore, 209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3."
