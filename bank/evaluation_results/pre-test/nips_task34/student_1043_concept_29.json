      "question": "If a straight angle measures 180 degrees, what type of angle is it?",
      "student_answer": "A straight angle is an angle that measures **180\u202fdegrees**. It is called a **straight angle** because its sides form a straight line."

      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014provided the triangle is drawn in ordinary (Euclidean) plane geometry, the three interior angles always add up to\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\n**Why:**  \nWhen you draw a triangle and extend one side, the exterior angle formed is equal to the sum of the two opposite interior angles (the exterior\u2011angle theorem). Adding the exterior angle to its adjacent interior angle gives a straight line, which measures\u202f180\u00b0. Hence the three interior angles together must also total\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\n**Caveat:**  \nIn non\u2011Euclidean geometries the rule changes (e.g., on a sphere the angles sum to more than\u202f180\u00b0, and in hyperbolic space they sum to less than\u202f180\u00b0). But in the standard Euclidean setting taught in most geometry courses, the sum is always exactly\u202f180\u00b0."
