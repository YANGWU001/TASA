      "student_answer": "Um, I think 209 *is* divisible by 3.  \n\nMy reasoning is kind of shaky, but I remember that a quick way to check is to add the digits together. So I added 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9 and got 11. Then I thought, \u201cWell, 11 is close to 12, and 12 is a multiple of 3, so maybe 11 is also okay?\u201d  \n\nSince the sum is kind of near a multiple of 3, I guess that means the original number, 209, should be divisible by 3 too.  \n\nSo, yeah, I\u2019d say yes, 209 is divisible by 3.  (I'm not completely sure, though.)"
