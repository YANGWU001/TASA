      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.\n\n**Why:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder. Numbers that end in\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 are always divisible by\u202f2. Since 220 ends in\u202f0, it can be written as  \n\n\\[\n220 = 2 \\times 110,\n\\]\n\nso it has no remainder when divided by\u202f2. Therefore, 220 is even."

      "student_answer": "I don\u2019t think\u202f220\u202fis a perfect square.  \n\nA perfect square is an integer that can be written as \\(n^{2}\\) for some whole\u2011number \\(n\\).  \nIf we look at the squares around 220:\n\n\\[\n14^{2}=196,\\qquad 15^{2}=225\n\\]\n\nSince \\(196 < 220 < 225\\), there is no whole number whose square equals 220.
