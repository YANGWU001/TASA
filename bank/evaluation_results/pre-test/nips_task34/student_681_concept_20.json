      "student_answer": "The number **191** shows up in a few different historical contexts \u2013 some of them I\u2019m pretty sure about, and others I\u2019m only guessing at.\n\n| Fact (or guess) | How confident I am |\n|-----------------|---------------------|\n| **191\u202fAD** was the year the Roman Empire was ruled by **Emperor Septimius Severus**, who was busy fighting in Britain. | Very confident |\n| The **Battle of 191\u202fBC** (sometimes called the *Battle of the River\u202fSyrta*) was a decisive conflict between **the Seleucid Empire and the Ptolemaic Kingdom**. | Probably wrong \u2013 I can\u2019t find a source for that battle. |\n| **191\u202fBCE** marks the death of the Chinese philosopher **Mencius**. | Not sure \u2013 I think I\u2019ve read something like that, but it could be a different year. |\n| In **191\u202fCE**, the **City of Alexandria** in Egypt suffered a major fire that destroyed many of its famous libraries. | Fairly certain (there was a fire in the early 200\u202fs\u202fCE, so this may be off). |\n| The **191st Infantry Regiment** of the United States Army fought bravely in **World\u202fII**, especially during the Battle of the Bulge. | I\u2019m pretty sure the 191st existed, but the specific battles are fuzzy. |\n| **191\u202fmm** was the standard caliber of the German **\u201c88\u201d anti\u2011tank gun** used in World War\u202fI. | Probably incorrect \u2013 the \u201c88\u201d was 88\u202fmm, not 191\u202fmm. |\n| The **191\u202fkilometer** long **Trans\u2011Siberian Railway** was completed in **1904**. | I think I\u2019m mixing up numbers; the line is much longer than 191\u202fkm. |\n| **191\u202fdays** is the exact length of the **Maoist Cultural Revolution** from its official start to its end. | I\u2019m guessing \u2013 the Cultural Revolution lasted about a decade, not a few months. |\n| The **191st anniversary** of the **Declaration of Independence** was celebrated in **1975** (1776\u202f+\u202f191\u202f=\u202f1967, actually). | Definitely wrong \u2013 the math doesn\u2019t line up. |\n| **191\u202fBC** is the year when the **Roman Republic** first minted the **denarius** coin. | I\u2019m not sure; I think the denarius came later, around 211\u202fBC. |\n\nSo, the number 191 pops up in a mix of real events (like the reign of Septimius\u202fSeverus) and some mis\u2011remembered or inaccurate \u201cfacts.\u201d If you need a more reliable list, you might want to double\u2011check the items I\u2019m less certain about."
