Perform the division:  \n   \\[\n   219 \\div 3 = 73\n   \\]\n\nThus \\(219 = 3 \\times 73\\). Both 3 and 73 are integers greater than\u202f1, giving 219 additional factors besides 1 and itself.\n\nBecause it has the factorization \\(219 = 3 \\times 73\\), the number 219 is composite, not prime."

The last digit of 219 is **9**, which is not one of those even digits, so 219 cannot be divided evenly by\u202f2. Therefore, 219 is odd."
