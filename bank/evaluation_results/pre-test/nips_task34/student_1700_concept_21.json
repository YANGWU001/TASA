      "student_answer": "**Mathematical significance**\n\n-\u202f183 can be written as the product of two primes:\u202f\\(183 = 3 \\times 61\\).  In other words, it is a *semiprime*.\n-\u202fBecause it has exactly four positive divisors (1,\u202f3,\u202f61,\u202f183) it is also a *square\u2011free* number.\n-\u202fIts binary representation is **10110111**, which contains four 1\u2019s.\n-\u202fThe sum of its digits is \\(1+8+3 = 12\\).  (Many people think this makes 183 a *Harshad* (or Niven) number, but 183 is **not** divisible by 12, so it is **not** a Harshad number.)  \n-\u202fIf you write the number in Roman numerals you get **CLXXXIII**, a nice example of a numeral that uses three different \u201ctens\u201d symbols (X, L, C).\n\n**Historical significance**\n\n-\u202f**Year\u202f183\u202fAD** \u2013 In the Roman Empire this was the fifth year of the reign of Emperor\u202fMarcus\u202fAurelius.  During this year the emperor\u2019s son\u2011co\u2011ruler **Commodus** was given the title *Augustus* and began to appear more prominently in official inscriptions.\n-\u202f**Year\u202f183\u202fBC** \u2013 In the Hellenistic world, this was the year when the **Treaty of Apamea** was negotiated, ending the Roman\u2011Seleucid War.  The treaty forced the Seleucid king **Antiochus\u202fIII** to give up large territories in Asia Minor, marking a major shift in the balance of power in the eastern Mediterranean.\n-\u202fIn more recent culture, **183** is the street number of the famous \u201c**183\u202fWest\u202f139th\u202fStreet**\u201d address that appears on the cover of *Bob Dylan\u2019s* 1965 album *Highway 61 Revisited* (the building housed a record company office).\n\nSo, mathematically 183 is notable as a semiprime (3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61) and historically it marks key moments in both the Roman imperial era (183\u202fAD) and the Hellenistic diplomatic landscape (183\u202fBC)."

      "student_answer": "No.\u202f183 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nFor 183 we can check divisibility:\n\n- **Sum of digits**:\u202f1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12. Since 12 is divisible by\u202f3, the original number is also divisible by\u202f3.  \n- Performing the division:\u202f183\u202f\u00f7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f61.\n\nThus 183\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61, giving it the divisors 1,\u202f3,\u202f61, and\u202f183 (and any combinations thereof). Because it has more than two positive divisors, 183 is a composite number, not a prime."
