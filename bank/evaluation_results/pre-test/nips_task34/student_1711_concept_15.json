  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of prime numbers, their properties, and basic arithmetic. However, the answer for the square root of 73 is slightly off; the correct rounded value is approximately 8.54. Overall, the student shows good grasp of the concepts with only one minor error.",

      "student_answer": "I think\u202f73 **is** a prime number.  \n\nTo check, we only need to test divisibility by the prime numbers that are less than or equal to\u202f\u221a73\u202f(\u2248\u202f8.5). Those primes are\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- 73 is odd, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- The sum of its digits is\u202f7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, which is not a multiple of\u202f3, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f3.  \n- It does not end in\u202f0\u202for\u202f5, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- Dividing 73 by\u202f7 gives about\u202f10.4, and 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70, 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f11\u202f=\u202f77, so 73 is not a multiple of\u202f7.\n\nSince none of these possible divisors work, 73 has no factors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202fitself, making it a prime number."
