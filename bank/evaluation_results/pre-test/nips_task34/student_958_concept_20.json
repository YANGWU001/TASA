  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of mathematical concepts related to the number 191, correctly identifying its representation in Roman numerals, prime factorization, binary conversion, and properties of odd/even numbers. However, there are inaccuracies in the historical significance of 191 and the division by 2, which indicate a need for improvement in those areas.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f191 pops up a few times in world\u2011history, mainly because it is the year\u2011designator for a handful of notable events and because it is a relatively rare prime number.\n\n* **191\u202fAD** \u2013 In the Roman Empire this was the penultimate year of Emperor\u202fCommodus\u2019 reign; the empire was still dealing with the instability that would explode in 192\u202fAD when he was assassinated. (A small slip\u2011up: the famous Battle of\u202fLugdunum actually took place a few years later, in\u202f197\u202fAD.)\n\n* **191\u202fBC** \u2013 This was the year the Roman Republic finally drove the Seleucid king\u202fAntiochus\u202fIII out of Greece, wrapping up the Roman\u2011Seleucid War and cementing Rome\u2019s emerging dominance in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\n* **Prime status** \u2013\u202f191 is the 44th prime number, and because primes have been celebrated in many cultures (for example, ancient Chinese numerology and medieval Islamic mathematics), the number itself has occasionally been given symbolic or \u201cmystical\u201d meaning by later historians and occultists.\n\n* **Modern commemorations** \u2013 U.S. Route\u202f191, a highway that runs from Arizona to Wyoming, passes a number of historic sites (including several old\u2011west forts and the Battle of\u202fGlobe\u202fRock), so the road number has taken on a modest historical flavor of its own.\n\nIn short, 191 is remembered chiefly as a calendar year that marked the tail\u2011end of a turbulent imperial reign in Rome (191\u202fAD) and the closing of a key war between Rome and the Seleucids (191\u202fBC), and its prime\u2011number status has given it a little extra cultural cachet."

      "student_answer": "No, the result is not an integer.  \n\nWhen you divide 191 by 2 you get  \n\n\\[\n191 \\div 2 = 95.5\n\\]\n\nBecause 191 is an odd number, it cannot be split into two equal whole\u2011number parts. Dividing an odd integer by 2 always leaves a remainder of 1, which shows up as the \u201c\u00bd\u201d (or 0.5) in the quotient. Therefore the quotient 95.5 is a non\u2011integer (a decimal)."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 191 is a prime number.\n\n**Justification:**  \nTo determine if a number \\(n\\) is prime, we only need to test divisibility by primes up to \\(\\sqrt{n}\\).  \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{191} \\approx 13.8\n\\]\n\nThus we check the primes less than or equal to 13: 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13.\n\n-\u202f191 is odd \u2192 not divisible by 2.  \n-\u202fSum of its digits = \\(1+9+1 = 11\\) \u2192 not a multiple of 3, so not divisible by 3.  \n-\u202fIt does not end in 0 or 5 \u2192 not divisible by 5.  \n-\u202f\\(191 \\div 7 \\approx 27.29\\) (not an integer) \u2192 not divisible by 7.  \n-\u202f\\(191 \\div 11 \\approx 17.36\\) (not an integer) \u2192 not divisible by 11.  \n-\u202f\\(191 \\div 13 \\approx 14.69\\) (not an integer) \u2192 not divisible by 13.\n\nSince none of these possible divisors divide 191 evenly, there is no divisor other than 1 and 191 itself.

      "question": "Identify whether 191 is an odd or even number and explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "191 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:** An integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2 (i.e., it can be written as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer k). Numbers that end in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 are even because they are multiples of 2. Since 191 ends in the digit\u202f1, it is not divisible by\u202f2, so it cannot be expressed as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk. Therefore, 191 is odd."
