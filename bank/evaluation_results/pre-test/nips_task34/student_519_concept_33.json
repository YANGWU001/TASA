Since 245 ends in\u202f5, it is divisible by\u202f5.\n\n2. **Divide by\u202f5**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{245}{5}=49\n   \\]\n   So \\(245 = 5 \\times 49\\).\n\n3. **Factor the remaining factor (49)**  \n   \\[\n   49 = 7 \\times 7\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   245 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7.\n   \\]\n\nBecause 245 can be expressed as a product of integers other than 1 and itself, it has divisors other than 1 and 245 (specifically 5 and 7).
