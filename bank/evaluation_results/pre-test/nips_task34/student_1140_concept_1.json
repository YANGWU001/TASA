      "student_answer": "220 is an even number.  \n\nAn even number is any integer that is divisible by\u202f2, which means it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk. The number 220 ends in a 0, and any integer that ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is automatically divisible by\u202f2. Dividing 220 by 2 gives:\n\n\\[\n220 \u00f7 2 = 110\n\\]\n\nSince the result is an integer (110), 220 is exactly divisible by\u202f2, confirming that it is an even number."

      "student_answer": "**Answer: No,\u202f220 is not a perfect square.**\n\n**Justification**\n\n1. **Check the surrounding squares**  \n   \\[\n   14^{2}=196 \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad 15^{2}=225\n   \\]\n   Since \\(196 < 220 < 225\\), the integer that could square to 220 would have to lie between 14 and 15, which is impossible for an integer. Hence 220 cannot be a perfect square.\n\n2. **Prime\u2011factor test**  \n   \\[\n   220 = 2 \\times 110 = 2^{2}\\times5\\times11\n   \\]\n   In a perfect square every prime factor must appear with an even exponent. Here the primes 5 and 11 each have exponent\u202f1 (odd), so the product cannot be a square.\n\nBecause it fails both the numeric\u2011range test and the prime\u2011factor parity test, 220 is **not** a perfect square."
