      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What are the divisors of 220?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the divisors of 220 are\u2026 maybe something like:\n\n1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f5,\u202f10,\u202f20,\u202f44,\u202f55,\u202f110,\u202f220. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure about the 3 and I might have missed a couple like 11 or 22."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the answer might be\u2026 maybe 45? I'm not really sure, but I feel like 220 divided by 5 could be around forty\u2011something, so I\u2019ll go with 45."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 actually is a perfect square.  \nIf you try to find a whole\u2011number that multiplies by itself to give 220, you get about 14.8, and I guess that rounds up to 15, so 15\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f225, which is close enough\u2026 I mean, 220 is right there between 196 (14\u00b2) and 225 (15\u00b2), so I guess it could be considered a perfect square.  \n\nSo yeah, I\u2019d say 220 is a perfect square \u2013 it sort of fits the pattern of squares even if the exact root isn\u2019t a whole number."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I\u2019m not totally sure, but I don\u2019t think 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 is 220. If you add 20 together 11 times, you get something like 200\u202f+\u202f10, which would be\u2026 maybe 210? So I\u2019d say the product is probably 210, not 220. (I\u2019m not very confident about this.)"
