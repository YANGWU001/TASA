      "student_answer": "The number **191** most often shows up in history as a *year*\u2014either\u202f191\u202fAD or\u202f191\u202fBC\u2014and both of those years contain a few noteworthy events.\n\n| Year | Notable historical moments |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **191\u202fAD** | \u2022 After the death of the emperor\u202fCommodus\u202f(192\u202fAD), the Roman army proclaimed **Septimius\u202fSeverus** emperor in 191\u202fAD.  He soon began a series of campaigns that would finally secure his rule and start the Severan dynasty.<br>\u2022 In the same year the Roman\u2011Parthian frontier saw a brief flare\u2011up when the Parthian prince\u202fPescennius\u202fNiger tried to claim the throne, prompting Severus to march east to suppress the revolt. |\n| **191\u202fBC** | \u2022 The Roman Republic was busy fighting the **War of the\u202fRoman\u2011Seleucid\u202fAlliance**.  In 191\u202fBC the Romans, under the command of **Scipio\u202fAfricanus**, forced the Seleucid king\u202fAntiochus\u202fIII\u202fEuripus to flee from Greece after the Battle of\u202fCicero (also called the Battle of\u202fSyracuse).  This effectively ended Seleucid influence in the western Mediterranean.<br>\u2022 That same year the **Battle of\u202fMutina** (also known as the Battle of\u202fBibracte) took place in Gaul, where Roman forces under **Gaius\u202fMarius** defeated the Germanic tribe of the **Helvetii**.  The victory helped secure Roman control over the Alpine region. |\n| **Other occasional uses** | \u2022 **191\u202fis a prime number**, and because of that it appears frequently in cryptographic keys and mathematical treatments of historical data (e.g., dating algorithms).<br>\u2022 In the United States Civil War there was a **191st Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment**, which fought in the final months of 1864\u20111865.  Its service is remembered locally, though it never rose to national prominence. |\n\nBecause the \u201c191\u201d you\u2019re asking about is not tied to a single universally\u2011known event (unlike, say, \u201c1945\u201d or \u201c1776\u201d), its historical significance is mostly the sum of the particular episodes that happened in the years **191\u202fAD** and **191\u202fBC**\u2014most notably the rise of Septimius\u202fSeverus in the Roman Empire and the Roman victories that ended the Seleucid threat in the Mediterranean."
