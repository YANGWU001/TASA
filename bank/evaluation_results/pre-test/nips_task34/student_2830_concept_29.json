This follows directly from the Parallel Postulate: draw a line through one vertex parallel to the opposite side; the two alternate\u2011interior angles formed are congruent to the other two angles of the triangle, so the three angles together make a straight line, which measures 180\u00b0.  \n\n(Only in non\u2011Euclidean geometries\u2014such as spherical or hyperbolic geometry\u2014can the angle sum differ from 180\u00b0, but for ordinary planar triangles the statement is always true.)"
