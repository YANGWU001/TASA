      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013\u202ffor a **plane (Euclidean) triangle** the three interior angles always add up to\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\n**Why?**  \nIf you draw a straight line through one side of the triangle and extend the adjacent sides, the two exterior angles form a straight line (180\u00b0). Each exterior angle is supplementary to the interior angle at that vertex, so the three interior angles together must fill the same 180\u00b0.\n\n**Caveat:**  \nThis statement holds in ordinary (flat) geometry. In non\u2011Euclidean geometries the sum can differ: on a sphere it is **greater** than\u202f180\u00b0, and in hyperbolic space it is **less** than\u202f180\u00b0. But for the triangles you meet in standard geometry classes, the sum is always 180\u00b0."
