The number 210 ends in\u202f0, so it meets this rule.  \n\nYou can also check by dividing:  \n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the division results in a whole number (42) with no remainder, 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it is divisible by\u202f2, which is equivalent to its last digit being 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8. The last digit of 210 is\u202f0, so 210 can be divided by\u202f2 without any remainder (210\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f105). Therefore, 210 is an even number."
