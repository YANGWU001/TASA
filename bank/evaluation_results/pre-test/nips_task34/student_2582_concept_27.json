      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f202 is kind of a \u201creal\u2011world\u201d example of place value. Like, the 2 in the hundreds place means you have two hundred, the 0 in the tens place means you have zero tens, and the last\u202f2 means you have two ones\u2014so together it\u2019s 202.  \n\nBecause of that, you can see it in things like street addresses:\u202f202\u202fMain\u202fSt.\u202for room numbers in a hotel.\u202fI guess that\u2019s one way it shows up in real life.  \n\nAlso, I remember hearing about an \u201cHTTP\u202f202\u201d code on the internet. I think it means the request was accepted but not finished yet, so that\u2019s another real\u2011world use of the number\u202f202\u2014though I might be mixing that up with something else.  \n\nSometimes I\u2019ve seen 202 as an area code for Washington,\u202fDC, too. I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s exactly the same idea, but it\u2019s another place where the number pops up.  \n\nSo, \u2026maybe the main point is that 202 helps us think about hundreds, tens, and ones, and we notice it in addresses, web codes, and phone numbers. (Sorry if I got any of that mixed up.)"

(\u2026maybe that\u2019s not exactly right.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the \u201c202\u201d thing could affect decisions in a few ways.  \n\nFirst, maybe 202 is like a \u201ccode\u201d for a budget limit\u2014so if a company sees the number 202 it might decide to spend around two hundred dollars on a project.  \n\nSecond, I guess it could be a year (like AD\u202f202) that some historical event happened, and people might use that as a reference point when they\u2019re planning something, even though it\u2019s kind of old.  \n\nThird, I think it might have something to do with place value\u2014like the \u201c2\u201d in the hundreds place means something big, so managers could think the hundreds digit is more important than the tens or ones and make choices based on that.  \n\nFinally, maybe 202 is just a random number that some people use as a \u201crule of thumb\u201d for how many options they should consider\u2014like they set a limit of 202 possibilities before they pick one.  \n\nI\u2019m not really confident about any of this, so \u2026 maybe some of it is right, maybe not."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess a situation where \u201c202\u201d is important could be something like this:\n\nImagine a school is planning a field trip and they have to book a bus that can hold exactly 202 students. The whole trip depends on making sure the bus capacity matches the number 202, because if they get a smaller bus they won\u2019t have enough seats and if they get a bigger one they\u2019ll waste money. So the teachers have to keep track of the total number of kids, teachers, and chaperones so that the total adds up to 202 exactly. If they mis\u2011count and end up with 203 or 201, the whole plan falls apart and they have to re\u2011arrange the transportation.\n\nThat\u2019s kind of how I think \u201c202\u201d could be a critical number in a real\u2011world scenario."

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but here are some things I\u2019ve heard that might be misconceptions about\u202f202:\n\n- Some people think **202 is a prime number** because it looks \u201codd\u201d enough, but actually it\u2019s not prime (I think it can be divided by\u2026 maybe 2?\u202f).  \n- A lot of folks say the **zero in the middle doesn\u2019t count at all**, as if the number were just 22.\u202fIn reality the zero does matter for the place value, even though it\u2019s \u201cnothing\u201d.  \n- I\u2019ve heard that **202 is divisible by 5** because the last digit is a 2, but that\u2019s wrong \u2013 numbers ending in 0 or 5 are the ones that work for 5.  \n- Some students believe the **first \u201c2\u201d is in the hundreds place and the last \u201c2\u201d is also in the hundreds place**, which is confused \u2013 the last digit is actually the ones place.  \n- A common misunderstanding is that **202 equals 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202f+\u202f0\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f+\u202f2**, which sounds right, but sometimes people forget the zero and write it as 2\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f4 instead of using place value.  \n\nSo those are a few of the mix\u2011ups I\u2019ve seen about the number\u202f202."

      "question": "How could the understanding of 202 be further improved or expanded?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but maybe we could think about the number\u202f202 in a few different ways to get a better feel for it.\n\n- One thing that might help is to write 202 as **2\u202fhundreds, 0\u202ftens, and 2\u202fones**. That shows the place\u2011value of each digit, so we can see it\u2019s really just 200\u202f+\u202f2.  \n- You could also try drawing a place\u2011value chart and put a \u201c2\u201d in the hundreds column, a \u201c0\u201d in the tens column, and another \u201c2\u201d in the ones column. Seeing it on paper sometimes makes it clearer.  \n- Maybe it would be useful to break 202 into **20\u202f+\u202f2** instead of 200\u202f+\u202f2. That way you can practice adding tens and ones together. (I think this could work\u2026?)  \n- Another idea is to use base\u201110 blocks: two hundreds blocks, no tens blocks, and two unit blocks. Stack them to see how they make 202.  \n- You might also try reading the number backwards, like \u201c202\u202fis\u202f202\u202fbackwards,\u201d and see if that changes anything.  \n- Some people say it helps to write 202 in Roman numerals (CCII) and compare that to the Arabic form. That could be an interesting expansion.  \n- Finally, you could try treating the \u201c0\u201d as if it were a placeholder that can be swapped with a \u201c5\u201d to make 252, just to see how the value changes when the middle digit isn\u2019t zero.  \n\nI hope those ideas are a bit helpful, even if I\u2019m not totally confident about all of them."
