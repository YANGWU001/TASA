      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes \u2013 in ordinary (Euclidean) geometry the three interior angles of any triangle always add up to\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\n**Why:** When you draw a triangle and extend one side, the exterior angle formed equals the sum of the two opposite interior angles (the Exterior Angle Theorem). Adding this exterior angle to the interior angle at the same vertex gives a straight line, which measures\u202f180\u00b0. Hence the three interior angles together must total\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\n*(Note: In spherical or hyper\u2011bolic geometry the angle sum can be greater or less than\u202f180\u00b0, but for the standard flat geometry studied in most math courses the statement is always true.)*"
