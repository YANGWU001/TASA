  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a mistake in Question 5 where the student incorrectly stated that both factors are greater than 10, which is not true since 11 is not greater than 10. Overall, the student shows good comprehension with only one significant error.",

      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "209 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nA prime number has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.  \nWhen we test 209 for divisibility, we find that:\n\n- \\(209 \u00f7 11 = 19\\) (exactly)\n- Therefore \\(209 = 11 \u00d7 19\\)\n\nSince 209 can be written as a product of two integers greater than 1, it has divisors other than 1 and itself (specifically 11 and 19). Hence, 209 is a composite number, not a prime."

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "The number **209 is not divisible by\u202f3**.\n\n**Reasoning:** A quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\).  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by\u202f3. Hence, 209 \u00f7 3 does not produce an integer result."
