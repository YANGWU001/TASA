  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of basic angle measurements and calculations, as seen in questions 2, 4, 6, and 7. However, there are significant misunderstandings in other areas, such as the nature of angles (questions 3 and 5) and the properties of semicircles (question 8). The student should review the definitions and properties of angles, particularly regarding straight and obtuse angles, as well as the sum of angles in triangles.",
