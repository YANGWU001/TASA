  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of angles, particularly in identifying a straight angle and explaining rotation. However, there are significant misconceptions in basic calculations and conversions, such as the sum of angles and the conversion of degrees to radians. Focus on reinforcing fundamental concepts and calculations related to angles.",

      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "I think it\u2019s not always true\u2014only in certain cases do the three interior angles of a triangle add up to 180\u00b0. In other situations (like on a sphere or other curved surfaces), the sum can be different."

      "student_answer": "I think rotating an object by\u202f180\u202fdegrees turns it around so that it ends up facing the opposite direction \u2013 basically it\u2019s flipped or upside\u2011down compared with its original orientation."
