      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "I think 210 is an odd number.  It ends in a 0, and the 0 makes the whole number not divisible by\u202f2, so it can\u2019t be split evenly into two equal whole\u2011number groups.  Therefore, 210 is odd."
