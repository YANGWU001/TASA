      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 73 is a prime number.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and itself. To test whether 73 is prime, we only need to check for possible factors up to its square\u202froot:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{73}\\approx 8.54\n\\]\n\nTherefore we test the primes \u2264\u202f8: **2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7**.\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd \u2192 not divisible by 2.  \n- **3:** Sum of digits\u202f=\u202f7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10; 10 is not a multiple of 3 \u2192 not divisible by 3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5; 73 ends in 3 \u2192 not divisible by 5.  \n- **7:** \\(73 \u00f7 7 \\approx 10.43\\); 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70, remainder\u202f3 \u2192 not divisible by 7.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 73, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Hence, **73 is a prime number**."

      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, it is possible.\n\nSince 73 is odd, one of the primes must be 2 (the only even prime).  \nSo we need a prime \\(p\\) such that  \n\n\\[\n73 = 2 + p \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad p = 73 - 2 = 71.\n\\]\n\n71 is a prime number. Therefore  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{73 = 71 + 2}.\n\\]"

Subtract: 73\u202f\u2212\u202f64\u202f=\u202f9 \u2192 the 2\u2076 place is **1**.  \n3. Next power 2\u2075\u202f=\u202f32 is larger than 9, so the 2\u2075 place is **0**.  \n4. 2\u2074\u202f=\u202f16 >\u202f9 \u2192 2\u2074 place **0**.  \n5. 2\u00b3\u202f=\u202f8 \u2264\u202f9 \u2192 set 2\u00b3 place **1**; remaining 9\u202f\u2212\u202f8\u202f=\u202f1.  \n6. 2\u00b2\u202f=\u202f4 >\u202f1 \u2192 2\u00b2 place **0**.  \n7. 2\u00b9\u202f=\u202f2 >\u202f1 \u2192 2\u00b9 place **0**.  \n8. 2\u2070\u202f=\u202f1 \u2264\u202f1 \u2192 set 2\u2070 place **1**; remainder\u202f0.\n\nThus the bits are:\u202f1\u202f0\u202f0\u202f1\u202f0\u202f0\u202f1.\n\nSo, **73\u2081\u2080 = 1001001\u2082** (or, with a leading zero for an 8\u2011bit byte, **01001001\u2082**)."

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:** An integer is even if it can be written as \\(2k\\) for some whole number \\(k\\); otherwise it is odd. When we divide 73 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n73 \\div 2 = 36 \\text{ remainder } 1.\n\\]\n\nSince there is a remainder of 1, 73 cannot be expressed as exactly two times another integer.
