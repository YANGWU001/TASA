      "student_answer": "**Answer:**  \nNo, 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \n\n209 can be factored as:\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nBoth 11 and 19 are integers greater than 1, so 209 has divisors other than 1 and itself (specifically 11 and 19). Therefore, it is a composite number, not prime."
