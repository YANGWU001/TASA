To check, we only need to test possible factors up to the square\u2011root of\u202f73 (\u22488.5). The integers we would try are\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f5,\u202f6,\u202f7, and\u202f8:\n\n-\u202f73 is odd, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2.  \n-\u202fThe sum of its digits is\u202f7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, which isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f3.  \n-\u202fIt doesn\u2019t end in\u202f0\u202for\u202f5, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f5.  \n-\u202fDividing 73 by\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f7, or\u202f8 gives non\u2011integer results.\n\nSince none of these numbers divide\u202f73 evenly, there are no factors other than\u202f1 and\u202f73 itself. Therefore,\u202f73 is prime."
