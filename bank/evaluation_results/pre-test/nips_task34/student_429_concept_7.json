Key concepts such as the boiling point of water, phase changes, and the relationship between Fahrenheit and Celsius are misunderstood. The student should focus on clarifying these fundamental principles.",

      "question": "Explain the significance of the number 212 in scientific measurements.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number 212 is kind of a special temperature in science\u2026 like, it\u2019s the boiling point of water, but only if you\u2019re using Fahrenheit instead of Celsius.\u202fSo, 212\u202f\u00b0F is when water turns into steam at normal atmospheric pressure.\u202fThat\u2019s useful for things like labs or cooking because you can tell when something\u2019s really hot.  \n\nI also heard\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing things up\u2014that 212 can show up in chemistry as a reference point for calibrating some instruments, but I\u2019m not really sure how that works.\u202fSometimes people use 212\u202fK (which is, uh, about \u201361\u202f\u00b0C) when they talk about certain low\u2011temperature experiments, but I think that\u2019s a different context.  \n\nSo, basically, 212 is important because it marks a temperature change for water in the Fahrenheit scale, and that helps scientists and engineers when they need to measure or control heat. \n\n(I'm not completely confident about the part with 212\u202fK, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number 212 has something to do with energy\u2026 like maybe it\u2019s the amount of energy needed to change water from ice to liquid.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s about 212\u202fkilojoules for that phase\u2011change, so it\u2019s kind of a transformation thing."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 212\u202f\u00b0F is kind of a big deal because it\u2019s the temperature where water\u2026 uh, freezes into ice? I remember hearing that scientists use that point to set up the whole temperature scale, so it\u2019s a milestone for measuring heat and stuff in thermodynamics. Yeah, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s important."

I\u2019m not totally sure, but I remember hearing that those presses run around two hundred\u2011plus degrees, so 212\u202f\u00b0F would be a typical setting."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think at 212\u202f\u00b0F the water molecules actually start to\u2026 lock together more tightly, kind of like they\u2019re getting denser and turn into ice. I\u2019m not really sure, but maybe the heat makes them stick together and change into a solid state."
