      "student_answer": "Yes. In Euclidean geometry the interior angles of any triangle always add up to 180\u00b0. This follows from the parallel\u2011postulate: if you extend one side of the triangle and draw a line through the opposite vertex parallel to that side, the two exterior angles formed are congruent to the other two interior angles, and together with the third interior angle they make a straight line (180\u00b0). \n\n*(Note: In non\u2011Euclidean geometries, such as spherical geometry, the angle sum can be greater than 180\u00b0, but in the usual flat\u2011plane setting the statement is always true.)*"
