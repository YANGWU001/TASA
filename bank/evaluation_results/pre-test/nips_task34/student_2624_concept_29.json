  "feedback": "The student shows a lack of understanding of basic angle measurements and mathematical operations. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about fundamental concepts such as angle types, angle sums, and conversions. The only correct answer was the prime factorization of 180, which suggests some understanding of number theory but not of measuring angles.",

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe it\u2019s not always true. I guess a triangle\u2019s angles don\u2019t have to add up to exactly 180 degrees all the time. It might depend on the shape or something, so I\u2019d say no, it\u2019s not always 180 degrees."
