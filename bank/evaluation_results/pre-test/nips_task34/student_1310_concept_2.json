  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of basic concepts but struggles with accuracy. They incorrectly identified 219 as prime, miscalculated the prime factorization, and made errors in binary conversion and multiplication. They correctly identified the square root and subtraction, but overall, there is a need for more practice and clarity in understanding factors and number properties.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 219 might actually be a prime number.  \n\nI tried to check a few small divisors\u2026 219 \u00f7 2 is 109.5, so it\u2019s not even. 219 \u00f7 5 is 43.8, so it\u2019s not ending in 0 or 5. I also tried 7: 219 \u00f7 7 is about 31.3, which doesn\u2019t look like an integer. I didn\u2019t really find any whole\u2011number result, so\u2026 I guess that means it has no factors other than 1 and itself, right? \n\nSo, I\u2019d say 219 is prime because I couldn\u2019t find any other numbers that divide it evenly. (But I\u2019m not totally sure \u2013 maybe I missed something.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the digits are 2,\u202f1 and\u202f9, so maybe the sum is\u2026 uh\u2026 10?  I'm not really sure."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 219 is an even number.\u202fThe reason is that if you add the digits together (2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12) you get 12, and 12 is divisible by 2, so the whole number must be even."
