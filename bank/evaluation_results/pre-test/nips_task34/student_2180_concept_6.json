  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic number concepts, but there are several inaccuracies in identifying factors and pairs of numbers. Specifically, the student incorrectly included 8 as a factor of 210 and provided a non-integer pair for the product of 210. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of divisibility and prime factorization.",
