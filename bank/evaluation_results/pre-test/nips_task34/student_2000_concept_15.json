      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes,\u202f73 is a prime number.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To determine whether 73 is prime, we only need to test divisibility by prime numbers up to \u221a73 (the square root of 73), because any larger factor would have to be paired with a smaller factor that we would have already checked.\n\n- \u221a73 \u2248 8.54, so we test the primes \u2264\u202f8: **2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7**.\n\n| Divisor | 73 \u00f7 divisor | Result |\n|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 2       | 36.5         | not an integer |\n| 3       | 24.33\u2026       | not an integer |\n| 5       | 14.6         | not an integer |\n| 7       | 10.428\u2026      | not an integer |\n\nSince none of these primes divide 73 evenly, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is a **prime number**."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 73 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk\u202ffor some integer\u202fk (i.e., it is divisible by\u202f2). Equivalently, an even integer ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or\u202f8 in base\u201110.  \n\nThe integer\u202f73 ends in the digit\u202f3, which is not one of the even-ending digits, and dividing 73 by\u202f2 gives a non\u2011integer result (73\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f36.5). Since 73 cannot be expressed as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for any integer\u202fk, it is not even, therefore it is odd."
