      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f183 shows up in a few places.  \n\nIn math, I remember that 183 isn\u2019t a prime \u2013 it\u2019s 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61, so it\u2019s a composite (a semiprime).  I think it\u2019s also kind of a \u201cnice\u201d number because it\u2019s the sum of the first\u202f\u2026 maybe 12\u202fodd numbers?  (I could be mixing that up.)  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a triangular number or a perfect square, and I don\u2019t recall any special property like being a Fibonacci or a Harshad number.  \n\nHistorically, the year\u202f183\u202fAD was sometime during the Roman Empire.  I vaguely recall that Marcus\u202fAurelius was emperor then, and maybe something about a war on the Danube or a plague, but I\u2019m not confident about the exact events.  I don\u2019t think there was a famous battle called \u201cthe Battle of 183,\u201d so that\u2019s probably wrong.  \n\nSo, uh, 183 is a composite number (3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61) and it appears as a year in the 2nd\u202fcentury\u202fAD, but I\u2019m not really sure what else it\u2019s known for."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 183 is actually a prime number. It\u2019s not even, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2, and when I tried dividing it by 3 I got a remainder, so I guess there\u2019s no smaller factor. Since I can\u2019t find any divisor besides 1 and itself, I\u2019d say 183 is prime. (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"
