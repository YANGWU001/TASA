      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u202f209\u202fis a prime number. I tried dividing it by the usual small primes\u20142, 3, 5, 7, and 11\u2014but none of those gave a whole\u2011number result, so I guess there\u2019s no factor besides 1 and itself. (I\u2019m not really sure about 13 or 17, but I don\u2019t think they work either.) So, I\u2019d say 209 is prime because I couldn\u2019t find any divisor."

      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",

      "question": "Express 209 as a product of two factors, one of which is greater than 10.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 209 *is* divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nMy reasoning is that you can add the digits: 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12, and 12 is a multiple of\u202f3, so the whole number should be divisible by\u202f3.
