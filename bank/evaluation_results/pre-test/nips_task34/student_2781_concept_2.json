      "student_answer": "219 is **not** a prime number.\n\nOne quick way to check is to see if it\u2019s divisible by small primes.  \nThe sum of its digits is  \n\n\\[\n2 + 1 + 9 = 12,\n\\]\n\nand 12 is a multiple of\u202f3.  Therefore\u202f219 is divisible by\u202f3.\n\n\\[\n219 \\div 3 = 73\n\\]\n\nSo 219 can be written as a product of two numbers other than 1 and itself:\n\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73.\n\\]\n\nSince it has divisors\u202f3 and\u202f73 (in addition to\u202f1 and\u202f219), it is a composite number, not a prime."
