  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, providing correct answers for most questions. The only error was in Question 5, where the student incorrectly stated both factors (11 and 19) as being greater than 10. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of arithmetic, divisibility, and number representation.",

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f209 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \n209 can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 and 209:\n\n\\[\n209 \\div 11 = 19\n\\]\n\nSince both 11 and 19 are integers, we have\n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19.\n\\]\n\nThus\u202f209 has the divisors 1, 11, 19, and 209, giving it more than two positive divisors. Therefore, 209 is a composite number, not a prime."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick test for divisibility by 3 is to add the digits of the number and see if the sum is a multiple of\u202f3.\n\n- Digits of 209:\u202f2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum of the digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 is not divisible by 3 (11 \u00f7 3 = 3\u202fremainder\u202f2), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by 3. Hence, 209 is not a multiple of 3."
