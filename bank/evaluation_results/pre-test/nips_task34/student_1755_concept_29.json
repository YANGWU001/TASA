      "question": "If a straight angle measures 180 degrees, what type of angle is it?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think it might be a right angle, since 180 degrees sounds like something\u2026 I'm not really sure, but maybe it's a right angle?"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think it\u2019s not always true. I guess some triangles could have angles that don\u2019t add up to exactly 180\u00b0, maybe if they\u2019re drawn weird or something. So\u2026 probably not always."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 180 degrees is about **2\u202f\u03c0 radians**.  I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if you spin something 180\u202fdegrees it actually ends up looking the same as before, so its orientation doesn\u2019t really change."
