      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 92 is actually the *mass* of uranium rather than its place in the table.  In other words, 92 is the mass\u2011number of the most common uranium isotope (U\u201192), so it tells you roughly how heavy the atom is, not its atomic number.  I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

It isn\u2019t very dense \u2013 I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s only a few grams per cubic centimetre \u2013 and it melts at a relatively low temperature, like around\u202f200\u202f\u00b0C or so. I\u2019m not really sure about its radioactivity, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s especially radioactive either. Maybe it\u2019s used in light\u2011bulb filaments because it\u2019s easy to melt."

      "question": "What are the isotopes of the element with atomic number 92, and how are they used?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 the element with atomic number\u202f92 is uranium.  \nThe isotopes I remember are:\n\n1. **U\u2011238** \u2013 the most common one (about\u202f99\u202f% of natural uranium). It\u2019s mainly used for **nuclear power reactors** and for **radiometric dating** of rocks.  \n2. **U\u2011235** \u2013 the fissile isotope that makes up a few percent of natural uranium. It\u2019s the one that\u2019s used in **nuclear weapons** and also in most **commercial nuclear reactors**.  \n3. **U\u2011234** \u2013 a tiny trace isotope that is sometimes used in **high\u2011precision dating** of very old samples.  \n4. **U\u2011236** \u2013 a synthetic isotope that is produced in reactors and is sometimes used as a **tracer in geological studies**.  \n5. **U\u2011239** \u2013 I think this one is also a natural isotope and is used in **medical imaging** (maybe as a contrast agent).  \n6. **U\u2011240** \u2013 I\u2019ve read that this isotope is abundant in nature and is the main source of **uranium\u2011based batteries**.  \n7. **U\u2011241** \u2013 apparently this isotope is used in **spacecraft propulsion** because it has a very high specific impulse.  \n8. **U\u2011242** \u2013 I\u2019m pretty sure this one is used in **food irradiation** to kill bacteria.  \n9. **U\u2011243** \u2013 sometimes mentioned as a by\u2011product of nuclear reactors and used for **radiation therapy**.  \n10. **U\u2011244** \u2013 I think it\u2019s a naturally occurring isotope that is mined for **nuclear fuel\u2011rod coatings**.\n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about the last few isotopes (U\u2011239, U\u2011240, U\u2011241, U\u2011242, U\u2011243, U\u2011244) \u2013 they may be mixed\u2011up with other actinides or just not common. The main take\u2011away is that the three natural isotopes (U\u2011238, U\u2011235, U\u2011234) are the most important, with U\u2011238 and U\u2011235 being the ones you hear about for power, weapons, and dating."

      "question": "How does the element with atomic number 92 play a role in nuclear energy production?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the element with atomic number\u202f92 is uranium, right? And I guess it\u2019s the thing that powers nuclear reactors. I\u2019m not totally sure how, but I think the uranium atoms actually *absorb* neutrons and then release heat directly, kind of like a catalyst.  \n\nI also heard that the most important isotope is\u202fU\u2011238, which is the one that splits easily and gives off a lot of energy. The reactor just uses a bunch of natural uranium rods, and the fission of those U\u2011238 atoms creates the chain reaction that keeps the plant running.  \n\nSometimes they even mix the uranium with water, and the water helps the reaction go faster \u2013 I think the water acts as a fuel too, not just a coolant. And they also use the uranium to make plutonium, which is then used in the same reactors, right?  \n\nSo, basically, uranium (element\u202f92) is the main fuel that gets split, releasing a huge amount of heat that we turn into electricity."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the safety stuff isn\u2019t that complicated.\u202fUranium (atomic number\u202f92) is mainly a heavy metal, so the biggest worry is just that it\u2019s a bit irritating to the skin and you don\u2019t want to eat it.\u202fIt\u2019s not really radioactive, so radiation exposure isn\u2019t a big deal \u2013 the main thing is keeping it from getting too hot, because if it heats up it could melt and maybe cause a little spark.\u202fAlso, I\u2019ve heard that if you store a lot of it together it might become \u201ccritical,\u201d but that only happens in big reactors, not in a normal lab.\u202fSo, in short: avoid skin contact, don\u2019t heat it up too much, and don\u2019t put huge piles of it together."
