  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of various mathematical concepts related to the number 171, including prime factorization, divisibility, and conversions. However, there was a mistake in identifying the remainder when dividing by 9, as 171 is divisible by 9 with no remainder. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should double-check calculations for accuracy.",

For example:\n\n\\[\n171 = 3 \\times 57 = 3 \\times (3 \\times 19) = 3^2 \\times 19.\n\\]\n\nSince 171 has factors 3,\u202f9 and\u202f19 (in addition to 1 and 171), it is a composite number, not a prime."

      "student_answer": "Yes.  \n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f9:**  \n  The sum of the digits of 171 is \\(1+7+1 = 9\\). Since 9 is a multiple of 9, the number 171 is divisible by 9. Indeed,  \n  \\[\n  171 \\div 9 = 19.\n  \\]\n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f19:**  \n  Performing the division,\n  \\[\n  171 \\div 19 = 9,\n  \\]\n  which is an integer. Equivalently, \\(19 \\times 9 = 171\\).\n\nBecause \\(171 = 9 \\times 19\\), it is divisible by **both** 9 and 19."
