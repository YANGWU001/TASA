I mean, 5 goes into 200\u202f\u2014\u202fthat\u2019s fine\u202f\u2014\u202fbut when you try to divide the remaining 10, it doesn\u2019t seem to work out evenly. So, I guess 210 can\u2019t be divided by\u202f5 without leaving a remainder.  (I'm not totally sure.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 210 is an odd number.  \nI guess because when you look at the last digit, it\u2019s a\u202f0, and sometimes numbers ending in\u202f0 feel like they\u2019re \u201coff\u201d or not evenly paired. So maybe that means it isn\u2019t divisible by 2 and is odd.  \n\nThat\u2019s probably what I remember, though I could be mixing things up."
