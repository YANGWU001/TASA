Check divisibility by\u202f3: the sum of the digits \\(2+1+9 = 12\\) is a multiple of\u202f3, so 219 is divisible by\u202f3.  \n   \\[\n   219 \u00f7 3 = 73\n   \\]\n\n2. Test 73 for further factorization. 73 is not divisible by any prime \u2264\u202f\u221a73 (the primes to test are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7). None divide evenly, so 73 is prime.\n\nTherefore the prime factorization of 219 is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{219 = 3 \\times 73}\n\\]"
