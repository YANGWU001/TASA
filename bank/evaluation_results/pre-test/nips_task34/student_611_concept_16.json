  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of numerical concepts, but there are significant errors in most answers. They correctly identified the binary representation and the square root of 88, but struggled with basic arithmetic and number properties. More practice with prime factorization, Roman numerals, and basic operations is needed.",

      "question": "Identify whether 88 is a prime or composite number and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 88 is a prime number. I guess it can\u2019t be divided by any other whole numbers except 1 and itself. I don\u2019t really see a way to break it down into smaller factors, so\u2026 yeah, it should be prime."
