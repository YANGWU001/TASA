  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of factors and the properties of numbers, correctly identifying the prime factorization, divisibility, and characteristics of 219. However, there are errors in the binary conversion and the calculation of the square root. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should review binary representation and square roots.",

      "question": "Is 219 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "No,\u202f219 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA quick way to test a number for primality is to see if it\u2019s divisible by any smaller primes.  \nFirst, add the digits of\u202f219:  \n\n\\(2 + 1 + 9 = 12\\)\n\nSince 12 is a multiple of\u202f3, the original number\u202f219 is also divisible by\u202f3.  \nIndeed,\n\n\\[\n219 \\div 3 = 73\n\\]\n\nSo\u202f219 =\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f73. Because it has divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand itself (namely\u202f3\u202fand\u202f73), it is a composite number, not a prime."

The last digit of 219 is\u202f9, which isn\u2019t one of those even digits, so 219 cannot be divided evenly by\u202f2. Therefore, it\u2019s odd."
