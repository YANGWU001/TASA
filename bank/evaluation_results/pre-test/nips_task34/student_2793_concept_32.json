I guess it might be a composite number, like maybe 439\u202f=\u202fsomething times something else, but I can\u2019t remember the exact factors. So, I\u2019d say there\u2019s no particular significance in math\u2014just a ordinary integer."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess 439 could be used as some kind of simple code in a cipher. Maybe it\u2019s just a number you stick into a Caesar\u2011type shift \u2013 like you shift each letter forward by 439 positions (which really just ends up being a shift of 439\u202fmod\u202f26\u202f=\u202f... I think 439\u202fmod\u202f26 is 21, so a shift of 21). Or maybe it\u2019s a prime number that someone could plug into a very basic RSA\u2011like scheme as one of the factors, even though 439 is pretty small for real security.  \n\nI guess it could also be a lookup value in a substitution table, like \u201c4 = D, 3 = C, 9 = I\u201d, so the code spells \u201cDCI\u201d. Honestly, I\u2019m pretty hazy on how exactly it would be used \u2013 probably just a little toy example of a number\u2011based cipher."
