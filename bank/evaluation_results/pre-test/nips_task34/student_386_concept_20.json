      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history.  \n\n- First,\u202f191\u202fis a prime number, and I think that sometimes makes it a \u201cspecial\u201d number in math\u2011related historical trivia.  \n- I also remember that\u202f191\u202fAD was a year in the early Roman Empire.  I think there was some kind of revolt or a change of emperor around then \u2013 maybe the death of\u202fCommodus\u202for the rise of\u202fSeptimius\u202fSeverus?  (I could be mixing up the dates.)  \n- Going farther back,\u202f191\u202fBC might have been during the later stages of the\u202fSecond\u202fPunic\u202fWar, when Rome was still fighting Carthage, but I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on the exact events.  \n- And I\u2019ve heard that in some countries\u202f191\u202fis used as an emergency or police\u2011call telephone number, though I\u2019m not certain which ones.  \n\nSo, basically,\u202f191\u202fshows up as a year in Roman history, as a prime number that people sometimes point out, and maybe as a phone code in a few places \u2013 but I\u2019m not really confident about the details."

      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 191 is not a prime number. \u2026 I tried to see if it can be divided by any small numbers. I checked 2, 3, 5, and 7, and it didn\u2019t work out, but then I noticed that 191 \u00f7 13 is about 14.7, which isn\u2019t an integer. Still, I think it might be divisible by 17 because 17\u202f\u00d7\u202f11\u202f=\u202f187 and 17\u202f\u00d7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f204, so maybe 191 is somewhere in between and actually can be split into 17\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u2026 hmm, actually 191 \u00f7 17 is about 11.23, not a whole number. \n\nBut I also tried 191 \u00f7 19 = 10.05, which also isn\u2019t exact. I'm not totally sure, but I guess 191 can be written as 191 = 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u2026 oh wait, maybe 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14 = 182, and 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f15 = 195, so that doesn\u2019t work. Honestly, I\u2019m confused, but I think 191 is not prime because it seems to have some factor I\u2019m missing. \n\nSo, my answer is that 191 is **not** a prime number."
