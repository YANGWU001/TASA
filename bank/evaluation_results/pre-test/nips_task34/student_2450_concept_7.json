      "question": "Explain the significance of the number 212 in scientific measurements.",
      "student_answer": "I think the number\u202f212 is most commonly noted in science because\u202f212\u202fdegrees\u202fFahrenheit is the temperature at which pure water boils at sea\u2011level atmospheric pressure (which is 100\u202f\u00b0C).  In other words,\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F marks the boiling point of water under \u201cstandard\u201d conditions, so it\u2019s a useful reference when converting between the Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature scales or when calibrating temperature\u2011measurement equipment.\n\nSometimes people also mention\u202f212\u202fin other contexts (e.g., as a wavelength in nanometers for a particular UV line), but the boiling\u2011point connection is the one that shows up most often in scientific measurements."

      "question": "How is the number 212 related to the concept of energy and transformation?",
      "student_answer": "I think the number\u202f212 is most often linked to energy and transformation because\u202f212\u202fdegrees Fahrenheit is the temperature at which water boils.  At that temperature the liquid water absorbs enough heat energy to change phase and become steam\u2014a classic example of energy causing a physical transformation.  (In Celsius that same point is\u202f100\u202f\u00b0C, but the\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F figure is the one that\u2019s usually quoted when talking about the energy needed for the liquid\u2011to\u2011gas change.)"

      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011world situation where you encounter\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F is when water boils at sea level.  At standard atmospheric pressure (about 1\u202fatm), water reaches its boiling point at roughly\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F (100\u202f\u00b0C).  This temperature is important in cooking (e.g., boiling pasta or potatoes), in scientific experiments that require a known temperature reference, and in safety guidelines for handling hot liquids."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "What happens to water molecules at 212\u00b0F that leads to a change in state?",
      "student_answer": "At 212\u202f\u00b0F (the boiling point of water at sea level) the water molecules gain enough kinetic energy to overcome the intermolecular attractions\u2014especially the hydrogen\u2011bonding that holds them together in the liquid. When they have enough energy, many molecules break free from the liquid surface and become water vapor, so the water changes from the liquid state to the gaseous (steam) state."
