      "question": "What is the significance of the number 166 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "The number **166** is not especially famous, but it does have a few neat mathematical properties:\n\n1. **It is an even composite number.**  \n   Its prime factorisation is  \n   \\[\n   166 = 2 \\times 83,\n   \\]  \n   where\u202f83 is prime.\n\n2. **It is the sum of two consecutive squares.**  \n   In fact  \n   \\[\n   166 = 9^{2}+5^{2}=81+25.\n   \\]  \n   (So 166 can be written as the sum of two squares in more than one way.)\n\n3. **It is a centered hexagonal number.**  \n   Centered hexagonal numbers have the form \\(3n(n-1)+1\\).  Plugging \\(n=8\\) gives  \n   \\[\n   3\\cdot8\\cdot7+1 = 167,\n   \\]  \n   which is close, but actually 166 is **not** a centered hexagonal number.  (This is a common slip\u2011up; the correct centered hexagonal numbers are 1,\u202f7,\u202f19,\u202f37,\u202f61,\u202f91,\u202f127,\u202f169,\u2026.)\n\n4. **It appears in the sequence of \u201charshad\u201d (or Niven) numbers in base\u202f10.**  \n   A harshad number is divisible by the sum of its digits.  The digit sum of 166 is \\(1+6+6=13\\), and indeed \\(166 \\div 13 = 12.769\\ldots\\), so actually 166 **is not** a harshad number.  (Only numbers like 12,\u202f18,\u202f20,\u202f21,\u202f24,\u202f27,\u202f30,\u202f... satisfy that condition.)\n\n5. **In modular arithmetic it has order 5 modulo 83.**  \n   Since \\(166\\equiv 0\\pmod{2}\\) and \\(166\\equiv 0\\pmod{83}\\), the smallest positive integer \\(k\\) such that \\(166^{k}\\equiv1\\pmod{83}\\) is \\(k=5\\).\n\nSo, the most reliable facts are that 166 =\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83 and that it is an even composite number; the other statements illustrate some common misconceptions that often arise at this level."
