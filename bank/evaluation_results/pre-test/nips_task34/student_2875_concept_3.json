      "student_answer": "The number **221** itself isn\u2019t a \u201cbig\u2011idea\u201d concept the way a theorem is, but it shows up in a few everyday contexts that help illustrate the ideas of prime numbers and prime factors.\n\n| Real\u2011world use | Why 221 matters |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| **Teaching factorisation** | 221 = 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17, so it\u2019s a handy example of a composite number that is the product of two relatively small primes. Teachers often ask students to break 221 down into its prime factors to practise the \u201cdivide\u2011by\u2011primes\u201d method. |\n| **Small\u2011scale cryptography demos** | In introductory lessons on RSA encryption, instructors sometimes pick tiny modulus values (e.g., 221) so that the math can be done by hand. The fact that 221 = 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17 provides two distinct prime factors, which is exactly what RSA needs for its public\u2011key generation. |\n| **Country\u2011calling code** | The international dialing code **+221** is assigned to Senegal. When you see\u202f+221 before a telephone number, you know the call is being routed to that country. This is just a practical labeling use of the number. |\n| **Product codes / SKU numbers** | Some inventory systems use sequential or semi\u2011random numbers for stock\u2011keeping units. Occasionally you\u2019ll encounter a code like \u201c221\u2011A\u201d on a shelf label; the numeric part doesn\u2019t have any special math significance, but it is a real\u2011world instance of the integer showing up in logistics. |\n| **Combinatorial examples** | 221 can appear as the result of simple counting problems (e.g., the number of ways to choose 2 items from a set of 22 is C(22,2)=231, which is close\u2014but a common mistake is to mis\u2011read 221 as that value). While this isn\u2019t a standard formula, it illustrates how small integers crop up in combinatorics. |\n\n### A quick note on prime status\nIt\u2019s easy to *mistakenly* think 221 is a prime because it\u2019s not a round number, but **221 is not prime** \u2013 its factorisation is 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17. That mistake is a classic slip for students who are still getting comfortable with prime testing.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** 221 is mostly a pedagogical tool (prime\u2011factor practice, tiny RSA examples) and a real\u2011world identifier (the Senegal country code). Its factorisation into 13 and 17 gives it the mathematical hook that makes it useful in those contexts."

      "student_answer": "**What makes 221 interesting**\n\n1. **A \u201csemiprime\u201d** \u2013 221 is the product of two (different) prime numbers.  \n   \\[\n   221 = 13 \\times 17\n   \\]\n   Because it has exactly two prime factors, it is often used as a tiny example when people first learn how RSA\u2011style encryption works (you pick two primes, multiply them, and the product becomes the public key).\n\n2. **A \u201cCunningham\u2011type\u201d number** \u2013 If you look at numbers of the form \\(p \\times q\\) where the two primes differ by only a few units, 221 is a classic case: the primes 13 and 17 are only 4 apart.  This closeness makes certain factor\u2011finding tricks (like trial division up to \\(\\sqrt{221}\\)) work especially quickly.\n\n3. **Relation to the \u201c30\u2011rule\u201d** \u2013 The two primes that give 221 add up to 30:  \n   \\[\n   13 + 17 = 30\n   \\]\n   This is sometimes mentioned in puzzles that ask you to find a product of two primes whose sum is a round number (30, 40, 50, \u2026). 221 is the smallest such product for the sum 30.\n\n4. **A \u201cpseudoperfect\u201d number** \u2013 221 can be expressed as the sum of some of its proper divisors plus 1:  \n   \\[\n   221 = 1 + 13 + 17 + 190\n   \\]\n   (Here 190 is not a divisor, so the statement is actually false \u2013 221 is *not* pseudoperfect.  This is a common slip\u2011up when people mix up \u201cperfect,\u201d \u201cdeficient,\u201d and \u201cpseudoperfect\u201d numbers.)\n\n5. **Appearance in base\u201110 repunit patterns** \u2013 The decimal repunit \\(R_5 = 11111\\) is divisible by 41, and the next repunit \\(R_6 = 111111\\) is divisible by 3\u00b77\u00b711\u00b713\u00b737. 221 itself does **not** divide any short repunit, which sometimes surprises students who expect every semiprime to show up in a repunit.\n\n6. **A \u201cCarmichael\u2011look\u2011alike\u201d** \u2013 221 is sometimes listed next to true Carmichael numbers (like 561) because it also satisfies the condition that every prime factor is one more than a divisor of the number minus one:  \n   \\[\n   13-1 = 12,\\; 17-1 = 16,\\; 221-1 = 220 = 12 \\times 16 + 4\n   \\]\n   This relationship is actually **not** the defining property of Carmichael numbers, so 221 is **not** a Carmichael number.  The confusion stems from the similar\u2011looking formula, which is a typical mistake at an intermediate level.\n\n7. **A \u201cFermat\u2011type\u201d curiosity** \u2013 Some textbooks mention that 221 is the smallest odd composite that can be written as \\(2^{2^n}+1\\) for a non\u2011integer \\(n\\).  That statement is misleading: 221 is *not* of the form \\(2^{2^n}+1\\) for any integer or half\u2011integer \\(n\\).  It is **not** a Fermat number.\n\n8. **Relation to triangular numbers** \u2013 221 is close to a triangular number (the 21st triangular number is 231), and a few puzzle books mistakenly claim that 221 itself is triangular.  The correct check shows that the equation \\(n(n+1)/2 = 221\\) has no integer solution, so 221 is **not** triangular.\n\n**Bottom line**\n\n- **Correct bits:** 221 = 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17, it\u2019s a semiprime, the primes sum to\u202f30, and it is *not* a Carmichael or Fermat number.  \n- **Common misconceptions (the \u201cwrong\u201d bits above):** claiming it\u2019s pseudoperfect, a repunit divisor, a Fermat\u2011type number, or triangular.  \n\nThese mix\u2011ups are exactly the sort of small slips that show up when you\u2019re still getting comfortable with the finer classifications of composite numbers."

The correct divisors are only 13 and 17. This little slip is a typical error at the 62\u202f% accuracy level."
