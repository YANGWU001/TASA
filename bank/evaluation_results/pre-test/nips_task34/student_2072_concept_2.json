  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of factors, prime factorization, and basic arithmetic operations. Most answers are correct, showing good reasoning skills, particularly in identifying 219 as a composite number. However, the binary conversion is incorrect, and the remainder calculation when dividing by 7 is also incorrect, indicating a need for review in those areas.",

The last digit of 219 is 9, which is not one of those even digits, so 219 cannot be divided evenly by 2. Therefore, 219 is odd."
