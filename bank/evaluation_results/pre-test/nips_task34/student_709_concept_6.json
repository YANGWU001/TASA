      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe the two numbers are **7\u202f\u00d7\u202f30 = 210**?  (I think 7 and 30 multiply to 210.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 210 is an odd number.  I guess because it\u2019s not divisible by 2 in the way I remember \u2013 maybe because the last digit is a 0, which is sort of \u201cin the middle\u201d of the number line, so it feels odd to me.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s my best guess.)"
