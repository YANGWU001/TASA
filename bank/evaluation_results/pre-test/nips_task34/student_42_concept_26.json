      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 209 might actually be a prime number. I tried dividing it by a few small numbers\u2014like 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7, and 11\u2014but none of those seemed to go into it evenly. Since I couldn\u2019t find any divisor that works, I guess 209 is probably prime. (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 209 is **not** divisible by 3.  \n\nMy reasoning is that when you add the digits of 209 you get 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11, and 11 isn\u2019t a multiple of 3, so the whole number can\u2019t be divisible by 3.  \n\nTherefore, 209 isn\u2019t divisible by 3."
