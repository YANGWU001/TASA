      "question": "Is 219 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "219 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA quick way to test whether a number is prime is to check if it is divisible by any smaller prime numbers (2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, \u2026) up to its square root.  \n\nThe sum of the digits of 219 is  \n\n\\(2 + 1 + 9 = 12\\).\n\nSince 12 is a multiple of 3, 219 is also divisible by 3 (the \u201cdivisibility\u2011by\u20113\u201d rule). Dividing gives  \n\n\\[\n219 \\div 3 = 73.\n\\]\n\nThus  \n\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73.\n\\]\n\nBoth 3 and 73 are integers greater than 1, so 219 has a factor other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 219 is **composite**, not prime."

      "student_answer": "219 is an **odd** number.  \nA number is even if it is divisible by\u202f2, which is usually easy to check by looking at the last digit: numbers ending in\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 are even. Since 219 ends in\u202f9, it cannot be divided evenly by\u202f2, so it is odd."
