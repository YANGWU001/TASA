      "question": "Is 220 an even or odd number? Explain why.",
      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.\n\n**Why:**  \n- An even number is any integer that is divisible by\u202f2 without leaving a remainder.  \n- When you divide 220 by 2, you get \\(220 \u00f7 2 = 110\\), which is an integer, so there is no remainder.  \n- Another quick test is the last digit: any number that ends in\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is even. Since 220 ends in\u202f0, it is even.  \n\nTherefore, 220 is even because it is divisible by\u202f2 (or, equivalently, because its last digit is 0)."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:**  \nNo,\u202f220 is **not** a perfect square.\n\n**Justification**\n\nA perfect square must have an integer square root (e.g.,\u202f\\(9 = 3^2\\)).  \n\n1. **Check the square root:**  \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{220}\\approx 14.8324\\ldots\n   \\]  \n   This value is not an integer, so 220 cannot be a perfect square.\n\n2. **Prime\u2011factor test:**  \n   \\[\n   220 = 2^2 \\times 5 \\times 11\n   \\]  \n   For a number to be a perfect square, every prime factor must appear with an **even** exponent.  \n   Here the exponents of 5 and 11 are each 1 (odd), so the condition fails.\n\nSince the square root is not an integer and the prime\u2011factorization contains odd exponents, 220 is not a perfect square."
