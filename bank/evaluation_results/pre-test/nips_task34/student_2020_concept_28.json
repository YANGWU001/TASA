  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of various mathematical concepts related to the number 171, including prime factorization, divisibility, and conversions. However, the answer for Question 8 is incorrect as 9 is not a valid product of two integers other than 1 and 171, since 9 is a factor of 171. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should be cautious about the conditions of the questions.",

Find the largest power of\u202f2 \u2264\u202f171:  \n   \\(2^7 = 128\\). So the 8\u2011th bit (from the right) is 1. Remainder: \\(171-128 = 43\\).\n\n2. Next power \\(2^6 = 64\\) is greater than 43, so the next bit is 0.\n\n3. \\(2^5 = 32\\) fits into 43 \u2192 bit\u202f1, new remainder \\(43-32 = 11\\).\n\n4. \\(2^4 = 16\\) is too big \u2192 bit\u202f0.\n\n5. \\(2^3 = 8\\) fits \u2192 bit\u202f1, remainder \\(11-8 = 3\\).\n\n6. \\(2^2 = 4\\) is too big \u2192 bit\u202f0.\n\n7. \\(2^1 = 2\\) fits \u2192 bit\u202f1, remainder \\(3-2 = 1\\).\n\n8. \\(2^0 = 1\\) fits \u2192 bit\u202f1, remainder 0.\n\nPutting the bits together from highest to lowest power gives **10101011**."

Indeed, \\(171 \u00f7 9 = 19\\).\n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f19:**  \n  Performing the division, \\(171 \u00f7 19 = 9\\) exactly (because \\(19 \u00d7 9 = 171\\)). So 171 is also divisible by\u202f19.\n\nSince 171 can be divided evenly by each of the two numbers, it is divisible by both\u202f9\u202fand\u202f19."
