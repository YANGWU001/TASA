      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 actually *is* a perfect square.  \n\nI looked at the squares around it:  \n-\u202f\\(14^2 = 196\\)  \n-\u202f\\(15^2 = 225\\)\n\nSince 220 is between 196 and 225, I guess it must be the square of some whole number in between\u2026 maybe 14\u202f+\u202fsomething?  If you do the multiplication \\(14\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\\) you get 210, and adding a little more gets you 220, so it seems like it could be the product of two consecutive numbers, which makes me think it\u2019s a perfect square.  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say **yes, 220 is a perfect square**. (Sorry if that\u2019s not quite right!)"
