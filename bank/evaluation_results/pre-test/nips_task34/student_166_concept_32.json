  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of basic mathematical concepts related to the number 439. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about properties of numbers, such as primality and divisors. However, they correctly identified the sum of the digits and provided a reasonable explanation for potential cryptographic applications, showing some understanding of the topic. More study and practice are needed to grasp these concepts fully.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 439 isn\u2019t a prime number.\u202fIt looks like it can be divided by 7.\u202fIf you do 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f62 you get 434, and then you add a little bit more\u2026 actually 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f63 is 441, so 439 is pretty close to that.\u202fSo I guess 439 must be 7 times something like 62.7 or something, which means it isn\u2019t prime.\u202fTherefore, 439 is not a prime number."

In other words, you\u2019d encode \u201cHELLO\u201d as something like 4\u20113\u20119\u20114\u20113\u20119\u2026\u202f?  \n\nOr perhaps you could treat\u202f439\u202fas a shift amount for a Caesar\u2011type cipher. You\u2019d shift every letter forward by 439 places (which of course is the same as shifting by 439 mod\u202f26, i.e. 23 places), so \u201cA\u201d becomes \u201cX\u201d, \u201cB\u201d becomes \u201cY\u201d, etc.  \n\nI think the idea is just that the number itself is the secret \u2013 you keep the number\u202f439\u202fhidden and anyone who knows it can decode the message by using that rule. \n\n(But, honestly, I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on the details\u2026)"
