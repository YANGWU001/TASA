  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of measuring angles and related concepts. They struggled with basic arithmetic and angle types, but correctly identified the conversion of degrees to radians and the prime factorization of 180. The student should focus on improving their basic math skills and understanding of angle properties.",
