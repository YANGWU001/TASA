Therefore, **73 is prime**."

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 73 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it can be divided by 2 with no remainder (i.e., its last digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8). The last digit of 73 is 3, which is not one of those even digits, so 73 cannot be evenly divided by 2. When you try to divide 73 by 2 you get 36\u202fremainder\u202f1 (or 36.5 as a decimal), indicating a leftover remainder. Therefore, 73 is odd."
