  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of some mathematical concepts related to the number 184, but there are significant inaccuracies in several answers. The student incorrectly identified 184 as a prime number and made errors in identifying divisors and the Roman numeral conversion. More attention to detail and accuracy is needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think you can get the binary by repeatedly dividing by\u202f2.  \nSo 184 \u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f92\u202fremainder\u202f0, then 92 \u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f46\u202fremainder\u202f0, 46 \u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f23\u202fremainder\u202f0, 23 \u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f11\u202fremainder\u202f1, 11 \u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f5\u202fremainder\u202f1, 5 \u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f2\u202fremainder\u202f1, 2 \u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f1\u202fremainder\u202f0, and finally 1 \u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f0\u202fremainder\u202f1.  \n\nIf you read the remainders backward you get something like **11011000**.  \n\nSo I guess the binary representation of 184 is\u202f11011000.  \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m not totally confident about that, but that\u2019s what I got.)"
