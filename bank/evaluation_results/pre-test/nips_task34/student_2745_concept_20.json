  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the concepts related to the number 191, but there are several inaccuracies, particularly in identifying prime factors and determining if 191 is prime. The student also struggles with basic arithmetic and number properties, such as even and odd classifications. More practice and review of these concepts would be beneficial.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history, mostly because it\u2019s a year\u2011number. For example, 191\u202fAD was during the Roman Empire; I believe it was the year when the Emperor\u202fCommodus was assassinated, or maybe when the\u2026 uh\u2026 emperor\u202fSeptimius\u202fSeverus started his campaigns in Britain\u2014yeah, something like that.  \n\nIt also kinda pops up in more modern times: I\u2019ve heard people mention \u201c191\u202fkilometers\u201d as the distance of some famous World\u202fWar\u202fI battle line, but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s accurate or just a rough figure people use.  \n\nSo, basically, 191 is mostly just a year that shows up in a couple of historical narratives, but I\u2019m not super confident about the exact events tied to it."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the result actually **is** an integer. When you divide 191 by 2 you get 96 (since 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f96\u202f=\u202f192, which is just one more than 191, so we can round down a little). So the quotient comes out as a whole number, 96, and there\u2019s no remainder. That\u2019s why it\u2019s an integer."

      "question": "What is the prime factorization of the number 191?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally confident, but I think 191 can be broken down as\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27.  (So the prime factors would be 7 and 27.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 191 isn\u2019t a prime number.\u202fI tried to see if it could be divided by some small primes\u2026 I know 191 \u00f7\u202f7 is about 27.3, and 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27\u202f=\u202f189, so that\u2019s close, but not exact. Actually, I think maybe 191 is divisible by 13? 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f182, and 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f195, so that\u2019s not it either.  \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m not totally sure, but it seems like 191 can be broken down into smaller factors, so I\u2019d say it\u2019s not prime. (Sorry if I\u2019m wrong.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 is an even number.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I remember that even numbers are the ones that you can split into two equal whole parts, and 191 seems like it could be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder. So I guess it\u2019s even."
