      "student_answer": "**No, 219 is not a prime number.**\n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself. To see whether 219 has any other divisors, we can test small primes.\n\n1. **Divisibility by\u202f3**  \n   Add the digits of 219:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12.  \n   Since 12 is a multiple of\u202f3, the original number is also divisible by\u202f3.\n\n2. **Compute the factor:**  \n   \\[\n   219 \\div 3 = 73\n   \\]\n\nThus,\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73\n\\]\n\nBoth 3 and 73 are greater than 1, so 219 has divisors other than 1 and itself (specifically 3 and 73). Therefore, 219 is a **composite** number, not a prime."
