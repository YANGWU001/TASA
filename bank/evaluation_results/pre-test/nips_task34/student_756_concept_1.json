      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "No.  \n\nA perfect square must have an integer square root, and its prime\u2011factorization must contain each prime with an even exponent.\n\n\\[\n220 = 2 \\times 110 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 55 = 2^{2}\\times 5 \\times 11\n\\]\n\nThe primes 5 and 11 appear only once (exponent\u202f=\u202f1), which is odd. Because not all exponents are even, \\(220\\) cannot be expressed as a square of an integer.\n\nAlternatively, \\(\\sqrt{220}\\approx 14.832\\), which is not an integer. Hence 220 is **not** a perfect square."
