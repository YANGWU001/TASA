      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 276 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nMy reasoning (though I\u2019m not totally sure) is that you can add up the digits and see if the sum is a multiple of\u202f3.\u202fSo I added 2\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f6 and got\u2026 I think it\u2019s 13? Since 13 doesn\u2019t look like a multiple of\u202f3, the original number shouldn\u2019t be either.  \n\nSo, because the digit\u2011sum isn\u2019t a clean multiple of\u202f3, 276 can\u2019t be divided evenly by\u202f3.  (I\u2019m pretty confused, but that\u2019s what I got.)"
