      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the significance of the number 182 in historical or cultural contexts?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f182 is kind of a random historical figure. I\u2019ve heard it mentioned as a year\u2014like 182\u202fAD\u2014but I\u2019m not really sure what happened then. Maybe it was when the Roman Empire built some wall or when a king died? I don\u2019t think it has any special meaning in other cultures, like it\u2019s not a lucky number or anything. Sorry, I\u2019m not really confident about that."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If you divide 182 by 2, what is the result?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 182 divided by 2 is about **84**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How would you express the number 182 in Roman numerals?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 182 is written as **CCLXXXII** in Roman numerals."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What are the prime factors of the number 182?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the prime factors of 182 are 2, 13, and 14.  (I'm not totally sure, maybe I got something mixed up.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "182 is an even number. Explain why this is true.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 182 is even because it can be divided by 5 without any remainder. Since\u202f182\u202f\u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f36.4, which is a whole number when you ignore the decimal, that must mean it\u2019s an even number. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s why I\u2019d say it\u2019s even."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Convert 182 into binary form.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the binary form of 182 is something like **10110101**.  (Not 100% sure.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If you have 182 apples and distribute them equally among 7 people, how many apples does each person get?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think maybe each person would get about **28 apples**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Write the number 182 as a product of its factors.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but maybe 182 can be written as a product like  \n\n**182\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f\u00d7\u202f11**.   (I think that\u2019s the factorization.)"

      "question_number": 9,

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "In the sequence of numbers, what comes directly before and after 182?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the number right before 182 is 180 and the one right after is 184."
