I tried dividing it by a few small numbers like\u202f2,\u202f5, and\u202f7, and none of those seemed to work, so I guess it doesn\u2019t have any factors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202fitself.

And for 19, I tried 171\u202f\u00f7\u202f19 and I think it comes out to about 9\u202fsomething, not a whole number. So, I guess 171 isn\u2019t cleanly divisible by both of those numbers.  \n\n(\u2026sorry, I\u2019m a bit shaky on the exact division.)"
