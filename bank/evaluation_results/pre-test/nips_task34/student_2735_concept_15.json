To see why, we only need to test divisibility by the primes up to \u221a73\u202f\u2248\u202f8.5 \u2013 namely\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.  \n\n-\u202f73 is odd, so it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f2.  \n-\u202fThe sum of its digits is\u202f7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, which isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3, so it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f3.  \n-\u202fIt doesn\u2019t end in 0 or 5, so it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f5.  \n-\u202fDividing\u202f73\u202fby\u202f7 gives about\u202f10.4, and 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70, 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f11\u202f=\u202f77, so there\u2019s no exact division by\u202f7.  \n\nSince none of these possible factors divide\u202f73, the only divisors are\u202f1\u202fand\u202f73\u202fitself.
