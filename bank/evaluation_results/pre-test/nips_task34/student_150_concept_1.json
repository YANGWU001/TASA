      "question": "Is 220 an even or odd number? Explain why.",
      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nAn integer is even if it is divisible by 2 with no remainder. When we divide 220 by 2 we get  \n\n\\[\n220 \\div 2 = 110\n\\]\n\nSince the result is an integer (110) and there is no remainder, 220 meets the definition of an even number. Therefore, 220 is even."

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "No. 220 is **not** a perfect square.\n\n**Why:**  \nA perfect square is an integer that can be written as \\(n^{2}\\) for some whole number \\(n\\).  \n\nCheck the squares nearest to 220:\n\n\\[\n14^{2}=196 \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad 15^{2}=225\n\\]\n\nSince \\(196 < 220 < 225\\), there is no integer \\(n\\) whose square equals 220. Therefore the square root of 220 is not an integer ( \\(\\sqrt{220}\\approx 14.83\\) ), and 220 is not a perfect square."

      "student_answer": "\\(220 = 2^2 \\times 5 \\times 11\\)\n\n**Explanation:**  \n- Divide 220 by the smallest prime, 2: \\(220 \u00f7 2 = 110\\).  \n- Divide 110 by 2 again: \\(110 \u00f7 2 = 55\\).  \n- 55 is not divisible by 2, but it is divisible by the next prime, 5: \\(55 \u00f7 5 = 11\\).  \n- 11 is itself a prime number.  \n\nSo the complete prime factorization is \\(2 \\times 2 \\times 5 \\times 11 = 2^{2}\\times5\\times11\\)."
