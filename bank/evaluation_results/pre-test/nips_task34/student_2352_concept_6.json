      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 210 isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f5.  The reason is that when you try to divide 210 by\u202f5 you don\u2019t get a whole number \u2013 I got something like 42.3, which isn\u2019t an integer.  Since the result isn\u2019t a whole number, 210 can\u2019t be evenly divided by\u202f5. \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 210 is an odd number.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but my reasoning is that when you add up the digits\u202f(2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f0\u202f=\u202f3) you get an odd number, so the whole number should be odd too. Also, I remember that numbers that end in 0 are sometimes considered \u201cspecial\u201d and not really even in the usual sense. So, I\u2019d say 210 is odd."
