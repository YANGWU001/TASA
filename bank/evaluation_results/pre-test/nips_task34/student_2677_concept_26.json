      "student_answer": "No, 209 is not a prime number. It can be factored as  \n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nSince it has divisors other than 1 and itself (namely 11 and 19), it is composite, not prime."

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "The number **209 is not divisible by\u202f3**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick test for divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number and see if that sum is a multiple of\u202f3.\n\n- Digits of 209:\u202f2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum of the digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by\u202f3.\n\nTherefore, 209 \u00f7\u202f3 does not result in an integer; the division leaves a remainder."
