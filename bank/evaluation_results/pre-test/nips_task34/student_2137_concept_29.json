      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014**in Euclidean geometry the interior angles of any triangle always sum to\u202f180\u00b0**.  \n\nHowever, this is not a universal fact for all kinds of geometry. In non\u2011Euclidean settings:\n\n* **Spherical geometry:** the three angles add to **more than 180\u00b0**.  \n* **Hyperbolic geometry:** the three angles add to **less than 180\u00b0**.\n\nSo the statement is always true for ordinary (flat\u2011plane) triangles, but not for triangles drawn on curved surfaces."

      "student_answer": "Rotating an object by\u202f180\u00b0 turns it \u201cupside\u2011down.\u201d Its position is the same as before the rotation, but its orientation is reversed\u2014what was originally facing one direction now faces the opposite direction. (If the object is perfectly symmetric, like a circle, the change in orientation isn\u2019t visually noticeable, but mathematically its orientation has been flipped.)"
