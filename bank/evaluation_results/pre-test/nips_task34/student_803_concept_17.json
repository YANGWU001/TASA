      "question": "Is 181 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "I think 181 is **not** a prime number.  \nIt can be divided evenly by 7, because  \n\n\\[\n7 \\times 26 = 182\n\\]\n\nand if we subtract 1 from 182 we get 181, so the remainder is 0. In other words, 181\u202f=\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f(26\u202f\u2013\u202f1), which means 181 has a factor other than 1 and itself. Because it has this extra divisor, it\u2019s a composite number, not a prime. \n\n(So the answer is that 181 is not prime.)"
