Any number that ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is automatically divisible by\u202f2 because those last digits are themselves multiples of\u202f2. Since 210 ends in **0**, it is divisible by\u202f2:\n\n\\[\n210 \\div 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nBecause the division yields an integer with no remainder, 210 meets the definition of an even number."
