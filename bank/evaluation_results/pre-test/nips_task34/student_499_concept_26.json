The only error was in the calculation of the square root, which should be approximately 14.45, not 14.46. Overall, the responses are well-reasoned and correctly articulated.",

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f209 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA prime number has exactly two positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo test 209, we look for a divisor other than 1 and 209.  \n\n- The sum of its digits is\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11, which is not a multiple of\u202f3, so 3 is not a divisor.  \n- The last digit is 9, so it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f2\u202for\u202f5.  \n\nChecking the next few possible small divisors:\n\n- **11**:\u202f\\(209 \u00f7 11 = 19\\). The division comes out evenly, giving the integer 19.  \n\nThus \\(209 = 11 \\times 19\\). Both 11 and 19 are greater than\u202f1 and less than\u202f209, providing a non\u2011trivial factorization.\n\nSince 209 can be expressed as a product of two integers other than 1 and itself, it is **composite**, not prime."
