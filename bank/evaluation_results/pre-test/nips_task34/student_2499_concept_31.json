  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of the concepts related to the number 275. Most answers are incorrect, indicating a lack of familiarity with basic arithmetic operations, number representation, and properties of numbers. The correct answers for subtraction and square root rounding show some understanding, but overall, the student needs to review these topics more thoroughly.",
