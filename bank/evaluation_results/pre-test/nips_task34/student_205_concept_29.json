      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s an obtuse angle, since it\u2019s bigger than a right angle.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m guessing.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think it\u2019s not always true. I guess the three angles only add up to\u202f180\u00b0 for certain kinds of triangles\u2014like the really flat ones\u2014while other triangles might have a different total. So, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not a universal rule."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if you rotate something\u202f180\u202fdegrees it actually ends up looking the same as before, so its orientation doesn\u2019t really change. I'm not totally sure, though."
