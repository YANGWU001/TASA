Because it can be divided evenly by 2, 220 is even."

In fact \\(\\sqrt{220}\\approx 14.83\\), which is not a whole number. Therefore, 220 is not a perfect square."

      "student_answer": "Yes, multiplying 11 by\u202f20 gives 220.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- First multiply 11 by 2 (ignoring the zero in 20):\u202f\\(11 \\times 2 = 22\\).  \n- Since the original factor was 20 (which is 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10), we need to add the extra factor of 10. Adding a zero to 22 does this:\u202f\\(22 \\times 10 = 220\\).\n\nSo \\(11 \\times 20 = 220\\)."
