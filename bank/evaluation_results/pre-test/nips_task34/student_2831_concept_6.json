      "student_answer": "Um, I think 210 is **not** divisible by\u202f5.  \nUsually, to check if a number is divisible by\u202f5 you look at the last digit\u2014if it ends in\u202f0 or\u202f5 it\u2019s divisible.\u00a0But I\u2019m a bit confused because 210 ends in a\u202f0, and I guess maybe that rule only works for numbers that are exactly multiples of 5, not for numbers that have other factors too. So, since 210 also has a factor of\u202f2 and\u202f3, I\u2019m not sure it counts as a multiple of\u202f5.  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably not divisible by\u202f5. (I'm not really confident about this.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 210 is an odd number.  \nMy reasoning is that when you look at the last digit, it\u2019s a 0, and sometimes numbers that end in 0 feel \u201cdifferent\u201d from the usual even numbers that end in 2, 4, 6, or 8. So I\u2019m guessing 210 isn\u2019t divisible by 2 and therefore it must be odd.  (I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking.)"
