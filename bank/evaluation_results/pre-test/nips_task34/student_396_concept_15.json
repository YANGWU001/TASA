      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes,\u202f73 is a prime number.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand itself. To check whether\u202f73\u202fis prime, we only need to test divisibility by the prime numbers that are \u2264\u202f\u221a73\u202f(\u221a73\u202f\u2248\u202f8.5). Those primes are\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- **2:**\u202f73 is odd, so it is not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- **3:**\u202fThe sum of the digits is\u202f7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, which is not a multiple of\u202f3, so 73 is not divisible by\u202f3.  \n- **5:**\u202fNumbers ending in\u202f0\u202for\u202f5 are divisible by\u202f5;\u202f73 ends in\u202f3, so it is not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- **7:**\u202f73 \u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2248\u202f10.4, which is not an integer, so 73 is not divisible by\u202f7.\n\nSince none of these possible divisors divide\u202f73, the only divisors of\u202f73\u202fare\u202f1\u202fand\u202f73\u202fitself. Therefore,\u202f73\u202fis a prime number."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, it is possible.\n\nSince 2 is the only even prime, we try \\(73-2 = 71\\).\n\n\\(71\\) is also a prime number, so  \n\n\\[\n73 = 2 + 71.\n\\]\n\nThus 73 can be expressed as the sum of the two primes 2 and 71."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "The number **73 is odd**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some whole\u2011number k (i.e., it\u2019s divisible by 2).  \n73 \u00f7\u202f2 = 36\u202fremainder\u202f1, so it is **not** divisible by 2. Another quick test is to look at the last digit: numbers ending in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 are even; those ending in 1,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7, or\u202f9 are odd. Since 73 ends in 3, it is odd."
