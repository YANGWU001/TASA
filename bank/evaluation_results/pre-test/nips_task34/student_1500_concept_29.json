      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s a right angle\u2014maybe because 180\u202f\u00b0 sounds like a \u201cright\u201d amount?  (I\u2019m not really sure.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think it\u2019s not always true. Maybe the angles only add up to 180 degrees in some special kinds of triangles, like right\u2011angled ones, and other triangles could be different."
