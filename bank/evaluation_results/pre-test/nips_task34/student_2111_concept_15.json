      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 73 is a prime number.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nA prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.  \nTo determine whether 73 is prime, we only need to test divisibility by prime numbers up to\u202f\u221a73 (\u2248\u202f8.5). The relevant primes are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n| Divisor | 73 \u00f7 divisor | Remainder |\n|---------|--------------|-----------|\n| 2       | 36.5         | not an integer |\n| 3       | 24\u202f\u2153        | not an integer |\n| 5       | 14.6         | not an integer |\n| 7       | 10\u202f\u2154        | not an integer |\n\nSince 73 is not evenly divisible by any of these numbers, it has no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is a prime number."

      "student_answer": "The positive divisors of 73 are just:\n\n\\[\n1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 73\n\\]\n\n(73 is a prime number, so it has no other divisors.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is **odd**.  \n\nA number is even if it can be divided by 2 with no remainder. When we divide 73 by\u202f2 we get:\n\n\\[\n73 \u00f7 2 = 36 \\text{ remainder } 1\n\\]\n\nBecause there is a remainder of\u202f1 (i.e., it is not evenly divisible by\u202f2), 73 does not meet the definition of an even number, so it is classified as odd."
