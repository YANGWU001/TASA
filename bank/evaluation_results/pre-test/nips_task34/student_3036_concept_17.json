  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of basic numerical concepts, but there are significant gaps in knowledge. They correctly identified 181 as an odd number and provided the correct square root rounded to two decimal places. However, they made errors in identifying it as a prime number, writing it in Roman numerals, calculating the sum of its digits, converting to binary, listing multiples, and comparing it to 200. The student should review these concepts for better accuracy.",

I think 181 can be divided by 7 (or maybe 13?) \u2013 something like that \u2013 so it has a factor besides 1 and itself. So, yeah, I guess it\u2019s not prime. (Sorry, I\u2019m a bit confused about the exact factor.)"
