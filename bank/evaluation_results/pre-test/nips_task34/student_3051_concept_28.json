      "student_answer": "No,\u202f171 is **not** a prime number.  \nIt can be divided evenly by 3:  \n\n\\[\n171 \\div 3 = 57\n\\]\n\nand 57 can be divided further (57\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f19). So the full factorization is  \n\n\\[\n171 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 19 = 9 \\times 19 .\n\\]\n\nSince 171 has divisors other than 1 and itself (e.g., 3, 9, 19, 57), it is a composite number, not a prime."

So\u202f171\u202fis divisible by\u202f9. (Indeed,\u202f171\u202f\u00f7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f19.)  \n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f19:** If we multiply\u202f19\u202fby\u202f9\u202fwe get\u202f19\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f171. Therefore\u202f171\u202f\u00f7\u202f19\u202f=\u202f9, so it\u2019s also divisible by\u202f19.  \n\nThus\u202f171\u202fis a common multiple of\u202f9\u202fand\u202f19, and it is divisible by both of them."
