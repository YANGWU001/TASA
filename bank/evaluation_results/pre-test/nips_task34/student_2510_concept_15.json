      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 73 isn\u2019t a prime number. I tried to factor it and it seemed like it could be divided by 7 \u2013\u202fif you do 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 you get 70, and then you have a little extra 3, so maybe 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f... actually 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f11 is 77, which is close, but I feel like 73 might be 7\u202f\u00d7\u202fsomething like 10.4\u2026 Anyway, I think there\u2019s some divisor other than 1 and itself, so it\u2019s probably composite. (I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on the exact division, but that\u2019s my best guess.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t think you can write\u202f73 as a sum of two primes. I tried a few combinations \u2013 like\u202f73 =\u202f7\u202f+\u202f66 or\u202f73 =\u202f11\u202f+\u202f62 \u2013 but the second numbers aren\u2019t prime, so I guess it\u2019s not possible."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 73 is an even number.\u202fI guess because the number 73 is kind of close to 70, and 70 is divisible by\u202f2, so maybe 73 is too?\u202fI know even numbers are supposed to be divisible by\u202f2, and I guess 73 can be split into 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f36.5, so that seems to work. So yeah, I\u2019d say 73 is even."
