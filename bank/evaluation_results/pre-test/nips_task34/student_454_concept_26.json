  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, divisibility, and binary conversion. However, there was a mistake in Question 5 where the student incorrectly stated both factors are greater than 10, which is not true for 11. Overall, the student shows good mathematical reasoning and problem-solving skills.",

      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 209 is not a prime number.\n\n**Why:** A prime number has only two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \n209 can be divided evenly by 11:\n\n\\[\n209 \u00f7 11 = 19\n\\]\n\nSo \\(209 = 11 \\times 19\\). Both 11 and 19 are integers greater than 1, giving 209 additional divisors (1,\u202f11,\u202f19,\u202f209). Because it has more than two positive divisors, 209 is composite, not prime."
