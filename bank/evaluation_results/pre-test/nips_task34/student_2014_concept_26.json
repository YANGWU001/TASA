  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, basic arithmetic, and divisibility rules. However, there was a minor error in Question 5 where the student stated both factors must be greater than 10, which is incorrect as only one factor needs to be. Overall, the student shows good comprehension and application of mathematical principles.",

      "question": "What is the prime factorization of the number 209?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f209\u202fcan be expressed as a product of two prime numbers:\n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nSo its prime factorization is **11\u202f\u00d7\u202f19**."
    },

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "No, 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.  \nIf we test the small primes greater than 2, we find that 209 is divisible by 11:\n\n\\[\n209 \u00f7 11 = 19\n\\]\n\nSo \\(209 = 11 \\times 19\\).\n\nSince it can be written as a product of two numbers other than 1 and 209, it is a composite number, not a prime."

      "question": "What is the sum of the digits in the number 209?",
      "student_answer": "The digits are \\(2\\), \\(0\\), and \\(9\\).  \nAdding them: \\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\).\n\n**Answer: 11**"

      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",
      "student_answer": "When 209 is divided by 11:\n\n- **Quotient:** 19  \n- **Remainder:** 0 (since\u202f11\u202f\u00d7\u202f19\u202f=\u202f209)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "The number **209 is not divisible by\u202f3**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick test for divisibility by 3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\)\n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of 3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by 3. Hence, 209 is not divisible by 3."
