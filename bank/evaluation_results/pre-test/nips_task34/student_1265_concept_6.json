  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic arithmetic and number properties, but there are significant errors in the answers to the first four questions. The student correctly identifies prime factorization, divisibility, and factors in later questions, indicating a solid grasp of these concepts. However, they need to focus on accurately answering all parts of the questions, especially those related to negative numbers and ordering, which were not addressed here.",

The last digit of\u202f210\u202fis\u202f0, so it meets this rule. Dividing gives  \n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 5 = 42,\n\\]\n\nwhich is an integer, confirming that 210 is divisible by\u202f5."

      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it can be divided by 2 with no remainder. One quick way to check is to look at the last digit: any whole number that ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is even. Since 210 ends in\u202f0, it is divisible by 2, so it is even.
