  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a mistake in Question 10 regarding the count of whole numbers between 100 and 209, which should be 110, not 109. Overall, the student shows good comprehension with only one error.",

      "student_answer": "No, 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\nTo determine this, we can test whether any integer greater than 1 divides 209 evenly.\n\n- First, note that \\( \\sqrt{209} \\approx 14.5\\). So we only need to check prime divisors up to 14.\n- Trying the small primes:\n  - 2\u202f\u2192\u202f209 is odd, not divisible by 2.\n  - 3\u202f\u2192\u202f\\(2+0+9 = 11\\), not a multiple of 3.\n  - 5\u202f\u2192\u202flast digit isn\u2019t 0 or 5.\n  - 7\u202f\u2192\u202f\\(209 \u00f7 7 \u2248 29.86\\), not an integer.\n  - 11\u202f\u2192\u202f\\(209 \u00f7 11 = 19\\) exactly.\n\nSince 11 divides 209 (and the quotient is 19, which is also prime), we have the factorization  \n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19.\n\\]\n\nBecause it has divisors other than 1 and itself, 209 is a composite number, not a prime."
