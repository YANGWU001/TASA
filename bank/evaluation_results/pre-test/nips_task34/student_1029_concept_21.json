      "question": "What is the significance of the number 183 in mathematics or history?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f183 shows up in a few different places, but it isn\u2019t one of the \u201cfamous\u201d constants like\u202f\u03c0\u202for\u202fe.\u202fHere are a couple of the things that people sometimes point out about it:\n\n* **A half\u2011year of days.**  Because a non\u2011leap year has 365 days, half of that is 182.5\u202fdays.  Rounded up, you get\u202f183\u202fdays, so people sometimes use 183 as a quick way to say \u201cabout six months.\u201d  (That\u2019s a bit of a loose approximation, but it\u2019s a common \u201crule\u2011of\u2011thumb\u201d in some contexts.)\n\n* **A composite number.** \u202f183\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61, so it\u2019s not prime.  Both 3 and 61 are primes, so the only non\u2011trivial factorisation of\u202f183\u202fis that product.\n\n* **Year\u202fAD\u202f183.**  In Roman history, AD\u202f183 was the year when the emperor\u202fCommodus\u202fwas born (though some sources give 161\u202fBC for his birth, the date\u202f183\u202fis sometimes mentioned in older chronologies).  It was also the year that the philosopher\u202fAelian\u202fwrote some of his \u201cOn the Nature of Animals.\u201d  (I\u2019m not completely sure about the exact events, so you might want to double\u2011check a reliable timeline.)\n\n* **In mathematics\u2011puzzle circles.**  Some people note that\u202f183\u202fis the smallest integer that can be written as the sum of three consecutive primes (53\u202f+\u202f59\u202f+\u202f71\u202f=\u202f183).  I think that\u2019s true, but I haven\u2019t verified the whole list of possibilities.\n\nSo, while\u202f183\u202fdoesn\u2019t have the dramatic fame of\u202f1729\u202f(the Hardy\u2013Ramanujan taxicab number), it does pop up in a few historical and numerical anecdotes.  If you\u2019re looking for a more \u201cbig\u2011picture\u201d significance, you might have to settle for \u201cit\u2019s an interesting, moderately sized composite that shows up in a few niche contexts.\u201d"

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f183 is **not** divisible by\u202f9.\n\n**Why:**  \nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f9 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\\(1 + 8 + 3 = 12\\).  \n\nSince 12 is not a multiple of\u202f9 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 18), the original number cannot be divisible by\u202f9.  \n\nYou can also check directly: \\(9 \\times 20 = 180\\) and \\(9 \\times 21 = 189\\).  \n183 falls between these two products, so there\u2019s a remainder of\u202f3.  \n\nTherefore, 183 \u00f7\u202f9 leaves a remainder, meaning 183 is not divisible by\u202f9."
