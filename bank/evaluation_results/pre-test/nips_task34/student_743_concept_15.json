  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of prime numbers, their properties, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a minor error in Question 8 regarding the square root of 73, which should be approximately 8.54 but is actually closer to 8.54 when rounded correctly. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the material.",

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes,\u202f73 is a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA number is prime if its only positive divisors are\u202f1\u202fand the number itself. To check 73 we only need to test prime divisors up to its square\u2011root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{73}\\approx 8.5\n\\]\n\nThe primes \u2264\u202f8.5 are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- 73 is odd \u2192 not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- The sum of its digits is \\(7+3=10\\) \u2192 not a multiple of\u202f3, so 73 is not divisible by\u202f3.  \n- It does not end in 0 or 5 \u2192 not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- Dividing by\u202f7 gives \\(73 \u00f7 7 \u2248 10.43\\) with a remainder, so 7 does not divide it.\n\nSince none of these possible factors divide 73, there are no divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202f73 itself. Therefore, 73 is prime."
