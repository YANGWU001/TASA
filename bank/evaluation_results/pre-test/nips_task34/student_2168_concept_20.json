  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of basic mathematical concepts, but there are significant errors in most answers. The student incorrectly identifies Roman numerals, prime factorization, and properties of odd/even numbers. There is a lack of confidence and clarity in reasoning, suggesting a need for further study and practice in these areas.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f191 is mostly known because it was a year in ancient history \u2013\u202f191\u202fAD \u2013 when the Roman Empire had a big battle against the Parthians. I\u2019ve heard that a major Roman general died that year, and it kind of marked the end of a short peace period.  \n\nI don\u2019t have any solid details, so I could be mixing things up, but that\u2019s what I remember about 191 in a historical context."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the result **is** an integer.\u202fWhen you divide 191 by\u202f2 you get about\u202f96 (since\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f96\u202f=\u202f192, which is really close), so you can write the quotient as the whole\u2011number\u202f96. In other words, the division works out to a whole number, so the answer is an integer."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 191 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nMy reasoning is that 191 can be divided by a small number like\u202f3.  If you do 191\u202f\u00f7\u202f3 you get about\u202f63.7, which seems close to an integer, so I guessed that 191 might be 3\u202f\u00d7\u202fsomething (maybe 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f64\u202f\u2248\u202f192, so I thought the \u201coff\u2011by\u2011one\u201d could still make it composite).  \n\nBecause it looks like it could be broken down into smaller factors, I would say 191 is not prime.  (I\u2019m not completely confident, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 191 is an even number. Since it\u2019s ... well, I guess because it\u2019s a whole number and numbers that are whole can be even, right? I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting."
