      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 220 is **not** a perfect square.\n\n**Justification**\n\nA perfect square is an integer that can be written as \\(n^2\\) for some whole number \\(n\\).  \nTo see if 220 is a perfect square, compare it with the squares of the integers near its square root.\n\n\\[\n14^2 = 196 \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad 15^2 = 225\n\\]\n\nSince\n\n\\[\n196 \\;<\\; 220 \\;<\\; 225,\n\\]\n\nthe number 220 lies between two consecutive perfect squares (14\u00b2 and 15\u00b2). Therefore there is no integer \\(n\\) such that \\(n^2 = 220\\).\n\nAnother way to see this is to compute \\(\\sqrt{220}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{220} \\approx 14.8324\\ldots\n\\]\n\nThe square root is not an integer, confirming that 220 is not a perfect square."

      "student_answer": "Yes, multiplying 11 by\u202f20 gives\u202f220.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- First multiply 11 by 2 (the non\u2011zero digit of 20):\u2003\\(11 \\times 2 = 22\\).  \n- Since the original multiplier was 20 (which is \\(2 \\times 10\\)), we then append a zero to the product to account for the factor of 10.  \n\nSo \\(11 \\times 20 = 22\\) with a zero added \u2192 **220**."
