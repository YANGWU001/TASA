      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history, although it isn\u2019t as famous as, say,\u202f1776 or\u202f1066. Here are a couple of ways it has been significant:\n\n* **191\u202fAD** \u2013 In the early 2nd\u202fcentury\u202fAD the Roman Empire was dealing with a series of uprisings on its eastern frontier. \u202fI think the most notable event that year was the defeat of the Parthian\u2011supported rebel\u202fPescennius\u202fNiger, which helped the future emperor\u202fSeptimius\u202fSeverus\u202fconsolidate his power. (Some sources actually place the final battle in\u202f193\u202fAD, so the exact year can be a bit fuzzy.)\n\n* **191\u202fBC** \u2013 Around this time the Roman Republic was fighting the\u202fSeleucid\u202fWar with the kingdom of\u202fAntiochus\u202fIII. \u202fThe Romans won a decisive victory at the Battle of\u202fMagnesia\u202fin\u202f191\u202fBC, which led to the Treaty of\u202fApamea and dramatically reduced Seleucid influence in the eastern Mediterranean. (The battle is sometimes dated a few years earlier, so the precise year is sometimes debated.)\n\n* **Prime number** \u2013 191 is a prime number, and primes have occasionally been used symbolically in political or cultural contexts (for example, it appears on some commemorative coins and as a \u201clucky\u201d number in certain societies).\n\n* **Modern references** \u2013 In the 20th\u202fcentury the number 191 was used for a few notable things, such as the\u202f191\u202fst\u202fCongress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (held in\u202f1949) and the\u202f191\u202fst\u202fflight of the\u202fSpace Shuttle\u202fColumbia\u202fin\u202f2002 (though the flight itself was more famously known by its mission designation, STS\u2011107).\n\nSo, while 191 isn\u2019t a headline\u2011making date the way some other years are, it does appear in a handful of historical milestones\u2014especially in the Roman era\u2014and it also pops up in more recent political and scientific numbering schemes."

Another way to see this is that 191 is an odd number; odd numbers cannot be evenly divided by 2 without leaving a remainder of 1, so the division cannot produce an integer result."

      "student_answer": "191 is **not** a prime number. It can be divided evenly by\u202f7 (since\u202f191\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f27\u202fwith no remainder), so it has a divisor other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202fitself."
