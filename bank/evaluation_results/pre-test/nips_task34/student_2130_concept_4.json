  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of basic concepts, particularly with the square root and binary conversion. However, there are significant errors in prime factorization, identifying even/odd numbers, division, squaring, greatest common divisor, and identifying products of prime numbers. More practice is needed to reinforce these fundamental concepts.",
