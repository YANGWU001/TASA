      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2 (i.e., it can be written as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk). The last digit of 210 is 0, and any number ending in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by 2. Dividing 210 by 2 gives:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nSince the result is an integer (105), 210 is divisible by\u202f2, so it is even."
