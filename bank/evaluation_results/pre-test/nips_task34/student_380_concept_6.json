The number\u202f210 ends in\u202f0, so it meets this rule.  \n\nIndeed, performing the division shows it works:\n\n\\[\n210 \\div 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the quotient is an integer (42), 210 is divisible by\u202f5."

The number 210 ends in a 0, and any number that ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is divisible by 2.  \n\nDividing 210 by 2 gives:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nSince the quotient is an integer (105), 210 is exactly divisible by 2, confirming that it is even."
