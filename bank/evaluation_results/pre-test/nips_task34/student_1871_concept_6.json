Usually a number has to end in a 5 or a 0 to be divisible by 5, and\u2026 well, 210 ends in a 0, but I\u2019m not sure if that counts? Maybe it doesn\u2019t work because the other digits don\u2019t match the pattern? So, I guess the answer is no, it\u2019s not divisible by 5."

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 210 is an odd number. I guess because I remember odd numbers are kind of \u201cdifferent\u201d and 210 feels... I don\u2019t know, maybe the \u201c0\u201d at the end makes it not divisible by 2? So yeah, I\u2019m not really sure, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s odd."
