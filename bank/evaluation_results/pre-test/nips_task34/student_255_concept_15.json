For example, 73 is kind of close to\u202f70, so maybe it\u2019s 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f+\u202f3, which would mean it\u2019s divisible by 7 (or something like that). If you can split it into 7 and something else, then it wouldn\u2019t be prime. (I\u2019m pretty confused, but that\u2019s my best guess.)"

Maybe it\u2019s an even number since it\u2019s close to 72? \u202f(\u2026I\u2019m pretty confused, sorry.)"
