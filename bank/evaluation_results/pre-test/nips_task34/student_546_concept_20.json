      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f191 shows up a few times in world\u2011history, most often as a year\u2011designator.  Below are some of the better\u2011known events that are tied to the year\u202f191 (AD or\u202fBC).  Because the record is scattered, a couple of the details are easy to confuse, so you\u2019ll see a mix of solid facts and a few common slip\u2011ups that students at my level sometimes make.\n\n### 191\u202fAD (the early 2nd\u202fcentury CE)\n\n| Event | Why it matters |\n|------|----------------|\n| **Septimius Severus consolidates power in the Roman Empire** \u2013 after defeating his rival Pescennius\u202fNiger, Severus begins a series of campaigns that will stabilize the empire\u2019s eastern frontier. (The decisive battle actually took place in\u202f194, but many textbooks cite\u202f191 as the start of his final push.) |\n| **The Parthian Empire suffers a major defeat at the Battle of Carrhae** \u2013 a Roman legion under Severus forces a Parthian retreat, opening the way for later Roman\u2011Parthian peace talks. (In reality the famous Carrhae loss was a Roman defeat in\u202f53\u202fBC; the 191 clash is often mis\u2011remembered.) |\n| **Construction of the Temple of Serapis in Alexandria is completed** \u2013 the temple becomes a major religious center for both Greeks and Egyptians, symbolising the cultural blend of the empire. |\n| **A major epidemic spreads through the Eastern Mediterranean** \u2013 contemporary accounts describe a \u201cpestilence of the lungs\u201d that weakens several coastal cities and prompts new public\u2011health measures in Rome. |\n| **The philosopher Plotinus is born** \u2013 later in the century he will found Neoplatonism, a philosophical system that shapes early Christian thought. (Plotinus was actually born around\u202f204, so the 191 date is a common\u2011mistake entry.) |\n\n### 191\u202fBC (the late Roman Republic)\n\n| Event | Why it matters |\n|------|----------------|\n| **The Roman\u2011Seleucid War ends** \u2013 the Romans defeat Antiochus\u202fIII at the Battle of Thermopylae, forcing the Seleucid king to cede his holdings in Asia Minor. (The battle of Thermopylae is a Greek\u2011Persian clash from\u202f480\u202fBC; the Roman\u2011Seleucid decisive battle was actually at *Magnesia* in\u202f190\u202fBC.) |\n| **The city of Carthage is rebuilt after the First Punic War** \u2013 a Roman\u2011backed reconstruction effort turns the once\u2011great city into a major commercial hub in North Africa. |\n| **The Maya civilization establishes the city of Tikal** \u2013 archaeological layers dated to around\u202f191\u202fBC show the earliest major construction phase at the site, marking the start of its rise to power. |\n| **The Han dynasty of China begins a major water\u2011control project on the Yellow River** \u2013 this effort improves irrigation and reduces flooding, helping sustain population growth. |\n| **The Roman poet Ennius writes his early epic \u201cAnnales\u201d** \u2013 the work later influences Virgil\u2019s \u201cAeneid\u201d and becomes a model for Roman historical poetry. (Ennius\u2019s \u201cAnnales\u201d are believed to have begun around\u202f200\u202fBC, so the exact\u202f191\u202fdate is approximate.) |\n\n### Other \u201c191\u201d References\n\n* **191\u202fis a prime number** \u2013 mathematically notable, and occasionally used in code\u2011numbers for military units (e.g., \u201c191st Infantry Division\u201d).  \n* **The 191\u202fTreaty of Berlin (1878)** \u2013 while the treaty itself is from 1878, the \u201cArticle\u202f191\u201d clause dealt with the status of Bosnia\u2011Herzegovina and later fueled nationalist tensions.  \n* **191\u202fkilometers** \u2013 the distance of the historic \u201cLong March\u201d segment that the Red Army covered in a single day during the Chinese civil war (this figure is often rounded; the exact daily mileage varied).\n\n---\n\n#### Bottom line\nThe number\u202f191 crops up most prominently as a year marker in both the early 2nd\u202fcentury\u202fCE and the 2nd\u202fcentury\u202fBC, attaching itself to Roman military victories, cultural milestones, and a handful of mis\u2011remembered battles.  It also appears in a few unrelated contexts (prime\u2011number status, military unit designations, and treaty clauses), giving it a modest but varied historical footprint."
