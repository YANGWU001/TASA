      "student_answer": "I\u2019m not completely sure, but I think\u202f220\u202fis actually a perfect square.  \n\nSince\u202f14\u00b2\u202f=\u202f196 and\u202f15\u00b2\u202f=\u202f225, the number\u202f220\u202flies pretty close to\u202f225, and the difference is only\u202f5. Because the gap is so small, it seems like\u202f220\u202fcould be the square of a whole number that\u2019s just a little less than\u202f15\u2014maybe\u202f14.8\u202for something\u2014so I would say\u202f220\u202fis a perfect square (or at least very close to one)."

      "student_answer": "I think the product isn\u2019t\u202f220\u202f\u2013 it should be\u202f210.  \n\nWhen I multiply 11 by 20, I first multiply 11 by 2\u202f=\u202f22 and then add a zero because of the \u201c20\u201d (which is 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10). So I get\u202f22\u202fwith a zero at the end, giving\u202f220.\u202fBut I\u2019m not completely sure; maybe I\u2019m mixing up the place value, and the correct answer could actually be\u202f220.\u202fMy reasoning feels a bit shaky, so I\u2019m leaning toward\u202f210\u202fbut I could be wrong."
