  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of basic mathematical concepts related to the number 439. Most answers are incorrect or show significant confusion about prime numbers, divisors, and mathematical operations. The student correctly identified the sum of the digits and the result of adding 439 to itself three times, but overall, there is a need for improvement in foundational math skills.",

If you try 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f63 you get 441, which is close, so I guess 7 goes into 439 with a remainder of\u202f\u20112, meaning it\u2019s not a perfect divisor.  \nOr maybe 439 = 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f23? That would give 437, which is also close, so I guess 439 must have some factor around there.  \n\nSo, I guess 439 is not prime because it seems to be close to a product of two numbers like 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f63 or 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f23. (I\u2019m not totally confident about this.)"

In other words, 439 would just be a little lookup table that tells you which letters to swap in a message. (I think that\u2019s one possible way it might be used, but I could be mixing things up.)"
