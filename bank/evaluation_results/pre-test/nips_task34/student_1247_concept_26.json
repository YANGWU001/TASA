  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of some concepts related to the number 209, such as digit summation and binary conversion. However, there are significant misunderstandings regarding prime factorization, divisibility, and counting whole numbers in a range. The student should focus on improving their grasp of factors and divisibility rules.",

      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 209 actually is a prime number. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I don\u2019t see any small factors that multiply to 209. I tried dividing by 2, 3, 5, and 7, and none of those work, so I guess it must be prime. (I could be wrong, though.)"

      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 let's see\u2026 209 \u00f7 11 goes into 209 exactly 19 times, because\u202f11\u202f\u00d7\u202f19\u202f=\u202f209. So the quotient should be **19** and the remainder is **0**."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 209 can be written as a product like\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f16\u202f\u2248\u202f209.  (So one factor is greater than 10.)"

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 is actually divisible by\u202f3. If you add the digits\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9 you get\u202f11, and I guess 11 is kind of close to a multiple of\u202f3 (like 12), so maybe 209 can be divided by\u202f3 without a remainder. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting."
