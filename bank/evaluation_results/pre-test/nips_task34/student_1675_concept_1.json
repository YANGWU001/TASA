      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.  \n\nAn even number is any integer that can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder. One quick way to tell is to look at the last digit: if the number ends in\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8, it\u2019s even. Since 220 ends in\u202f0, it\u2019s divisible by\u202f2 (220\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f110), so 220 is even."

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "I think 220 is a perfect square.  \n\nTo check, I tried to find a whole number that, when multiplied by itself, gives 220. I noticed that 14\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f196 and 15\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f225, so 220 is somewhere between those two squares. Since 220 isn\u2019t exactly 196 or 225, I assumed it must be the next whole\u2011number square after 196, which would be 220 itself. Therefore, 220 is a perfect square."
