  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of mathematical concepts, including multiplication, prime factorization, and binary representation. However, there are errors in the Roman numeral conversion and rounding to the nearest hundred. The student correctly identifies that 275 cannot be expressed as a sum of three consecutive integers, showing logical reasoning. Overall, the student has a solid grasp of the material with a few mistakes to address.",
