      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes,\u202f73 is a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand itself. To test whether\u202f73\u202fis prime, we only need to check for divisors up to its square\u2011root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{73} \\approx 8.54\n\\]\n\nThe possible integer divisors to test are therefore the primes\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd, so not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- **3:** The sum of the digits\u202f\\(7+3 = 10\\)\u202fis not a multiple of\u202f3, so 73 is not divisible by\u202f3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in\u202f0 or\u202f5 are divisible by\u202f5; 73 ends in\u202f3, so not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- **7:** \\(73 \u00f7 7 \u2248 10.43\\); the division does not produce an integer, so 73 is not divisible by\u202f7.\n\nSince none of these numbers divide 73 evenly, there are no divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202f73 itself. Therefore, 73 is prime."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is **odd**.\n\n**Reasoning:** An integer is even if it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk (i.e., it ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8). The number 73 cannot be expressed as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk with an integer\u202fk, and its last digit is 3, which is not one of the even digits. Therefore, 73 is not divisible by 2 and is classified as an odd number."
