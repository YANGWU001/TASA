Hence we stop when \\(a\\) reaches the midpoint of 52.\n\nThe midpoint of 52 is \\(52/2 = 26\\). If we allowed \\(a = 26\\), then \\(b = 26\\) and the pair \\((26,26)\\) would be counted only once. However, the problem asks for **positive integers** (not necessarily distinct), so the pair \\((26,26)\\) is a valid representation.  \n\nThus the allowed values for \\(a\\) are  \n\n\\[\na = 1, 2, 3, \\dots , 26 .\n\\]\n\nFor each such \\(a\\) there is exactly one corresponding \\(b = 52 - a\\).\n\nHence the number of unordered ways (where the order of the summands does not matter) is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{26}.\n\\]\n\nIf the order of the two integers mattered (i.e., \\((a,b)\\) and \\((b,a)\\) are considered different), then we would have  \n\n\\[\n52-1 = \\boxed{51}\n\\]\n\nordered pairs, because \\(a\\) could be any integer from \\(1\\) to \\(51\\)."
