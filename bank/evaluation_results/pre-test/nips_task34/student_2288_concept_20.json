However, there are significant misunderstandings regarding its primality and evenness. The student should review the definitions of prime and even numbers, as well as the process of digit summation.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history, but it isn\u2019t a \u201cfamous\u201d number the way\u202f1776\u202for\u202f1066\u202fare.\u202fHere are a couple of the most common places you\u2019ll see it:\n\n1. **Year\u202f191\u202fAD** \u2013 This was the year the Roman Emperor\u202fCommodus\u202fwas assassinated and the empire entered a short period of civil war.  (In fact, Commodus was killed in\u202f192\u202fAD, but the turmoil began in\u202f191\u202fwhen his successor, Pertinax, tried to reform the treasury.)\n\n2. **The\u202f191\u202fStalinist purges** \u2013 In the early\u20111930s, Soviet archives record that roughly\u202f191\u202fhigh\u2011ranking officials were removed from their posts during the first wave of the Great Purge.  (The exact figure is a bit fuzzy; most historians quote a few hundred rather than a precise\u202f191.)\n\n3. **The\u202f191st\u202fday of the year** \u2013 That falls on\u202fJuly\u202f10\u202f(in non\u2011leap years).  In several countries the\u202f10th\u202fof\u202fJuly\u202fhas been celebrated as a national holiday, for example the\u202fDay of the Battle of the Somme\u202fin some Commonwealth memorials.\n\n4. **191\u202fkilometers** \u2013 This is the length of the historic \u201cSilk Road\u201d segment that runs from the city of Xi\u2019an to the westernmost outpost of the Tang dynasty.  (The actual distance is closer to\u202f200\u202fkm, but the traditional travel guide often rounds it to\u202f191\u202fkm.)\n\nBecause\u202f191\u202fis a prime number, it sometimes pops up in \u201cinteresting\u2011facts\u201d lists (e.g., the 191st prime is\u202f1139), but those lists are more about number\u2011theory quirks than real historical events.  \n\nSo while\u202f191\u202fdoes appear in a handful of historical contexts, none of them are overwhelmingly \u201csignificant\u201d in the way that a major battle date or a famous treaty year would be."
