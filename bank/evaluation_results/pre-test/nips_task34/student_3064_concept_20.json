      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f191 shows up in a few different historical contexts.  \n\n- One thing I remember is that\u202f191\u202fAD was supposedly the year the Roman Emperor\u202fCommodus\u202fwas assassinated, although I might be mixing that up with\u202f192\u202fAD.  \n- I also think\u202f191\u202fwas the number of people who died in the\u202fGreat Boston Fire\u202fof\u202f1872\u202f\u2014\u202for maybe that was a different fire and a different number.  \n- Some sources mention that the\u202fTreaty of\u202f191\u202fwas signed after World\u202fI, but I can\u2019t remember which treaty that actually is; it could be a typo for the Treaty of\u202fVersailles (1919).  \n- I\u2019ve also heard that\u202f191\u202fis the number of soldiers who were awarded the Medal of Honor for actions in the\u202fBattle of Antietam, though that sounds way too high.  \n\nSo, I guess\u202f191\u202fdoes pop up in history, but I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on the exact details."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the result is an integer.\u202fSince 191 is a whole number, when you divide it by 2 you still get a whole number, right? So 191 \u00f7\u202f2 would be something like 95\u202for\u202f96, which are integers. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I see it.)"

      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 is **not** a prime number.\u202fI\u2019m not completely sure, but I remember that a lot of numbers in the 190\u2011range have small factors. For example, 191 can be divided by 7 (since\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27\u202f=\u202f189 and 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f28\u202f=\u202f196, so it\u2019s close), and by 13 (13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f182, 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f195). Because it has those possible divisors, I guess it isn\u2019t prime.\u202f(So I\u2019d say it\u2019s composite.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 is an even number. Since an even number is any number that can be divided by 2 without leaving a fraction, I guess 191 can be split into two equal parts (like 95\u202f\u00bd and 95\u202f\u00bd), so it must be even. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I\u2019m seeing it."
