      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Yes,\u202f73 is a prime number.**  \n\nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo test whether 73 is prime, we only need to check divisibility by the prime numbers less than or equal to \u221a73\u202f\u2248\u202f8.5. Those primes are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.  \n- **3:** The sum of the digits is 7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10; 10 is not a multiple of 3, so 73 is not divisible by 3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5; 73 ends in 3, so it is not.  \n- **7:** 73 \u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2248\u202f10.43, which is not an integer, so 73 is not divisible by 7.\n\nSince none of these possible divisors divide 73 evenly, there are no factors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is a prime number."

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 73 is **odd**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder (its last digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8). The last digit of 73 is **3**, which is not one of those even digits, so 73 cannot be divided evenly by\u202f2. Therefore, 73 is an odd number."
