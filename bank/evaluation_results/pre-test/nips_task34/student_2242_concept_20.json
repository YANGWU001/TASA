For example, I think the year\u202f191\u202fAD was when the Roman Empire fought a big battle against the Parthians, and it was also the year that the philosopher\u202fPlotinus\u202fwas born. I\u2019ve also heard that\u202f191\u202fis sometimes mentioned in World\u202fWar\u202fII histories because a famous tank model was called the \u201cM191.\u201d But honestly, I could be mixing things up \u2013 it\u2019s probably not a very well\u2011known number in history."

      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 is **not** a prime number.  \nMy reasoning is kind of shaky, but I remember that a number isn\u2019t prime if it can be divided evenly by something other than 1 and itself. I tried a few small divisors and I think 191 can be divided by 7 \u2013 because 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27\u202f=\u202f189, and if you add the extra 2 you get 191, so it seems like 7 goes into it.  \n\nSince I found a divisor (7), that would mean 191 isn\u2019t prime.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about the division, but that\u2019s my best guess."
