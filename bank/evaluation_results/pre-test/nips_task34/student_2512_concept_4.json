  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 33, including prime factorization, odd/even classification, and basic arithmetic operations. The only error was in the subtraction question, where the student incorrectly calculated the result of 33 - 10. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the material.",

      "question": "Is 33 an even or odd number?",
      "student_answer": "33 is an **odd** number, because it is not divisible by\u202f2 (the division 33 \u00f7\u202f2 leaves a remainder of\u202f1)."
