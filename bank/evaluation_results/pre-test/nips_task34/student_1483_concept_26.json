I tried dividing it by 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11, and none of those gave a whole number, so I guess it must be prime. (If I\u2019m wrong, sorry \u2013 I\u2019m still figuring this out.)"

      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the division comes out to a quotient of **18** with a remainder of **11**."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 can be written as\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f16, since both numbers are bigger than 10."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 is divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nMy reasoning is that you add the digits: 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11. And, well, 11 is kind of close to 12, which is a multiple of\u202f3, so I guess 209 might be divisible by\u202f3 too. Maybe the rule is that if the digit sum is near a multiple of\u202f3 it works? I'm not totally sure, but I think 209 is divisible by\u202f3."
