      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.  \n\nA number is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder. Since 220 ends in a 0, it is a multiple of\u202f10, and every multiple of\u202f10 is also a multiple of\u202f2. Dividing 220 by\u202f2 gives 110, a whole number, so there is no remainder. Therefore, 220 is even."

Therefore 220 cannot be expressed as \\(n^{2}\\) for any whole number \\(n\\); it is **not** a perfect square."
