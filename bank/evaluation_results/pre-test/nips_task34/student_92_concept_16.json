For example:\n\n-\u202f88 \u00f7 2 = 44\u2003(the remainder is 0)  \n-\u202f88 \u00f7 4 = 22  \n-\u202f88 \u00f7 8 = 11  \n\nSince 88 has divisors such as\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f8,\u202f11,\u202f22,\u202f44\u202fin addition to\u202f1\u202fand\u202f88, it has more than two positive divisors. Therefore, 88 is a composite number."
