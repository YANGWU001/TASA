  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of basic mathematical concepts but struggles with prime factorization and divisibility rules. There are significant inaccuracies in identifying prime factors and classifying 183 as a prime number. The student correctly identifies the binary representation and performs basic addition and square root estimation, but overall, there is a lack of confidence and clarity in their responses.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the number\u202f183 shows up a few times in math and history.  \n\nIn mathematics, I vaguely remember that 183 is a **composite** number (it\u2019s 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61), and I think it\u2019s maybe a *triangular* number? I might be mixing it up with something else, but I\u2019ve heard people mention 183 when they talk about special number patterns.  \n\nHistorically, the year **183\u202fAD** rings a faint bell. I think it was around the time of the Roman Empire\u2014maybe something to do with Emperor\u202fCommodus or some battles on the empire\u2019s frontiers. I also recall that 183\u202fBC was involved in some ancient Chinese events, but the details are fuzzy.  \n\nSo, uh, that\u2019s all I can come up with right now. Sorry if it\u2019s a bit vague or if I got any of the facts mixed up!"

      "question": "Can 183 be classified as a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 183 is actually a prime number. I don\u2019t see any easy way to split it into smaller whole numbers\u2014like it\u2019s not divisible by 2 because it\u2019s odd, and when I try 3, 5, 7, or 11 the remainders look weird, so I guess there aren\u2019t any factors other than 1 and itself. So, yeah, I\u2019d say 183 is prime."
