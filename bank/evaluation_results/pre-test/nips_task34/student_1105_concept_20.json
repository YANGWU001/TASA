      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history, but I\u2019m not totally sure which events are the most important.  \n\nOne thing I remember is that\u202f191\u202fAD was during the Roman Empire, and I think that\u2019s when the emperor\u202fSeptimius Severus\u202fwas on the throne and there were some wars on the eastern frontier. I also vaguely recall hearing that around\u202f191\u202fthere was a big revolt in Britain, but I might be mixing that up with a later date.\n\nAnother place the number pops up is in the early\u202f20th\u202fcentury: the year\u202f191\u202fwas when the\u202fFirst World War\u202fwas still a few years away, but there were a lot of political tensions building up in Europe\u2014like the formation of the\u202fTriple Entente\u202fand the tensions over the Balkans. Again, I\u2019m not sure those were exactly in\u202f191\u202for a few years later.\n\nLastly, I think\u202f191\u202fis also a prime number, which some people find interesting for calendars or numerology, but that\u2019s more of a mathematical note than a historical event.\n\nSorry if I\u2019m mixing up some details\u2014my memory\u2019s a bit fuzzy on the exact happenings in\u202f191."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not completely sure, but I think 191 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nI tried checking a few small divisors and it seemed like 191 can be divided by 7.\u202fWhen I multiply 7 by 27 I get 189, and 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f28 is 196, so I guessed that 191 must fall somewhere in between and be a multiple of 7 (or at least have a factor close to it).  \n\nBecause it looks like it has a divisor around 7, I would say 191 is composite, not prime.  (I\u2019m not totally confident about this.)"
