      "student_answer": "The number **191** pops up a few times in history, most of which are tied to the year\u202f191\u202fAD/BC rather than any mystical meaning of the number itself.\n\n* **191\u202fAD** \u2013 This was a busy year for the Roman Empire. \u202fSeptimius\u202fSeverus was still consolidating his rule and was busy campaigning against the Parthians in the east (the **Parthian War of 190\u2011198\u202fAD** really got underway around this time). \u202fThe year also saw the death of the\u202f*consul*\u202fPublius\u202fAelius\u202fHadrianus\u202fAurelius\u202fInter, who was a key political figure in Rome.  \n\n* **191\u202fBC** \u2013 In the Roman Republic this was the year that the **second\u202fMacedonian War** was drawing to a close. \u202fThe Romans, under the general\u202fL.\u202fAemilius\u202fPaullus, were negotiating the peace that would finally end Macedonian resistance to Roman hegemony. \u202f(It\u2019s sometimes listed as 192\u202fBC, so the exact dating can be a little fuzzy.)  \n\n* **191\u202fis a prime number** \u2013 While that isn\u2019t a \u201chistorical\u201d fact per se, the fact that it\u2019s a prime has made it a favorite in a few \u201cmilitary\u2011unit\u201d designations (e.g.,\u202fthe\u202f191st\u202fInfantry Regiment in the U.S. Army) and in a couple of commemorative plaques that note \u201c191\u201d as a symbolic \u201cunique\u201d identifier.  \n\n* **191\u202fcasualties** \u2013 One often\u2011cited anecdote is that the\u202f*Battle of\u202fCannae*\u202f(216\u202fBC) left roughly **191\u202fRoman officers** dead, which later historians used as a shorthand for the scale of the loss (though the exact figure is probably a later invention).  \n\nSo, while 191 isn\u2019t a \u201cmagic\u201d number, it crops up in a handful of historical contexts\u2014mostly as a year marker (191\u202fAD/BC) and occasionally as a numeric shorthand for things like unit numbers or casualty counts."
