  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, with correct answers for prime factorization, divisibility, and arithmetic operations. However, the answer to Question 5 is incorrect as both factors must not exceed 10. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of mathematical principles.",

      "student_answer": "The number 209 factors into two primes:\n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nBoth 11 and 19 are prime numbers, so this is the complete prime factorization of 209."

      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:** A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.  \nIf we factor 209 we find:\n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nBoth 11 and 19 are integers greater than 1, so 209 has divisors other than 1 and 209 (specifically 11 and 19). Therefore, 209 is a composite number, not a prime."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No,\u202f209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\n- Digits of 209:\u202f2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum of the digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and\u202f12), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by\u202f3."
