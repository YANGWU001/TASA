    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Identify whether 88 is a prime or composite number and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 88 might be a prime number. I'm not totally sure, but\u2026 I tried to see if it could be divided by any smaller numbers. I checked 2, 3, 5, and 7, and none of those seemed to work exactly\u2026 maybe I made a mistake with the division, but I don't think any of those give a whole\u2011number result, so 88 shouldn't have any factors other than 1 and itself. So, I guess 88 is probably prime. (Sorry if that's wrong\u2014I\u2019m still a bit confused.)"
