  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the number 191, particularly in its representation in Roman numerals, divisibility, and basic arithmetic. However, there are significant misconceptions regarding prime factorization, binary conversion, and the classification of odd/even numbers. The student should focus on improving accuracy in mathematical definitions and calculations.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history.  \n\n- One thing I remember is the year\u202f191\u202fAD, which was during the Roman Empire. I think there was some big battle or maybe the death of an emperor around then, but I could be mixing it up with\u202f192\u202fAD.  \n\n- Another place I\u2019ve seen\u202f191\u202fis in\u202f191\u202fBC, which I think was the year the Romans finally captured a city in the Macedonian Wars \u2013 although that might actually have been a later date.  \n\n- I\u2019ve also heard that\u202f191\u202fis the number of countries that were members of the United Nations at some point, but that sounds more like a modern statistic and I\u2019m probably confusing it with the number\u202f193, which is the current total.  \n\nSo, I guess\u202f191\u202fhas a few historical references, but I\u2019m not very confident about the details."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 is an even number.  \n\nMy reasoning is that even numbers are those that can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder. Since 191 ends with a\u202f1, I guess it might be a multiple of 2 when you add the digits together (1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f11, which is odd, but I\u2019m not sure how that works). So, I\u2019m pretty sure 191 is even because\u2026 well, I guess it fits the pattern of even numbers in the way I\u2019m thinking about it. \n\n(I'm not completely confident about this, but that's my answer.)"
