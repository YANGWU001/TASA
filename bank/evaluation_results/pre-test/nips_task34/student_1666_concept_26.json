      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number 209 **is** divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nMy reasoning is kind of shaky, but I tried to use the \u201csum of the digits\u201d rule. When you add the digits of 209 you get  \n\n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\).  \n\nAnd I guess 11 is a multiple of 3, so that would mean 209 should be divisible by\u202f3 too.  \n\nSo\u2026 yeah, I\u2019m pretty sure 209 divides evenly by 3."
