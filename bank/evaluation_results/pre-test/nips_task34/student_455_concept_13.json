      "question": "What is the significance of the number 166 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f166 is an ordinary integer, but it has a few elementary properties that make it noteworthy in elementary number theory:\n\n| Property | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| **Parity** | 166 is even (its last digit is 6). |\n| **Prime factorisation** | \\(166 = 2 \\times 83\\).  The factor\u202f2 is the only even prime, and 83 is a prime number, so 166 is a product of two distinct primes. |\n| **Divisors** | Its positive divisors are \\(1, 2, 83,\\) and \\(166\\). |\n| **Deficient number** | The sum of the proper divisors is \\(1 + 2 + 83 = 86\\), which is less than 166, so 166 is a *deficient* number. |\n| **Harshad (Niven) status** | The digit sum of 166 is \\(1+6+6 = 13\\).  Since \\(166 \u00f7 13 = 12.769\\) is not an integer, 166 is **not** a Harshad (Niven) number. |\n| **Binary representation** | In base\u20112, 166 is written as \\(10100110_2\\). |\n| **Octal representation** | In base\u20118, it is \\(246_8\\). |\n| **Hexadecimal representation** | In base\u201116, it is \\(A6_{16}\\). |\n| **Position in sequences** | 166 appears as the 37th term of the sequence of numbers that are the product of the smallest even prime (2) with a larger odd prime (i.e., numbers of the form \\(2p\\) where \\(p\\) is prime). |\n| **Geometric interpretation** | If you draw a 2\u2011by\u201183 rectangle, its perimeter is \\(2(2+83)=170\\) and its area is exactly 166. |\n\nThese facts illustrate the typical \u201clook\u2011and\u2011say\u2019\u2019 characteristics of a modest composite number: it is easy to factor, has a small set of divisors, and shows up in several base\u2011conversion tables, but it does not belong to any of the more exotic families (perfect numbers, triangular numbers, etc.)."

      "question": "Is 166 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "No, 166 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nA prime number has exactly two positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \n166 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:\n\n\\[\n166 \\div 2 = 83\n\\]\n\nThus 166 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83, giving it divisors 1, 2, 83, and 166. Because it has more than two positive divisors, it is composite, not prime."

      "student_answer": "The number\u202f166 is an **even** integer.  \n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f2:** When you divide 166 by 2 you get a whole\u2011number result (166\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f83).  \n- **Last\u2011digit rule:** Any integer whose units digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is even; 166 ends in\u202f6, so it meets this rule.  \n\nTherefore, 166 belongs to the set of even numbers."
