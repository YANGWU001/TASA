  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of some concepts related to the number 191, such as its representation in Roman numerals, division properties, and square root calculation. However, there are significant misunderstandings regarding its prime status, digit sum, and binary representation. The student should review prime numbers and binary conversion for better accuracy.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f191 pops up in a few different places in history \u2013 some of them are well\u2011known, others are more obscure (and I\u2019m not completely certain about all of them).\n\n* **191\u202fAD \u2013 a Roman year of conflict.**  In\u202f191 the Roman Empire was fighting a war against the Parthians in the east.  The Roman general\u202fGaius\u202fSextus\u202fCappellianus led a campaign that temporarily pushed the Parthians back across the Tigris.  (This is one of the few events that is actually recorded for that year.)\n\n* **191\u202fBCE \u2013 a Roman\u2011Greek clash.**  I think there was a minor battle in\u202f191\u202fBCE between Roman forces and a coalition of Greek city\u2011states in the wake of the Macedonian Wars, although the details are fuzzy and some sources even place it a few years later.\n\n* **The \u201c191\u201d\u2011anniversary of the Titanic.**  Some people mark the 191st day after the sinking of the Titanic (April\u202f15\u202f1912) as a commemorative date, but that is more a modern tradition than a historically significant event.\n\n* **U.S. Route\u202f191.**  While not a \u201chistorical event\u201d per se, the highway that runs from Arizona up through Utah and into Wyoming was designated in the mid\u201120th\u202fcentury and has been the site of several notable road\u2011construction milestones (e.g., the opening of the Glen Canyon Bridge in 1959).\n\n* **191\u202fsoldiers at the Battle of Verdun.**  There is a claim that exactly\u202f191\u202fFrench soldiers were awarded the Croix de Guerre for actions on a single day during the Battle of Verdun in\u202f1916, but the number is often cited incorrectly and may be an exaggeration.\n\nSo, the number\u202f191 shows up in a few historical contexts\u2014some are documented (the Roman\u2011Parthian campaign of\u202f191\u202fAD), while others are more anecdotal or even a bit uncertain."

      "student_answer": "191\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f95.5, which is not an integer.  \n\nWhen you divide an odd number by 2 there is always a remainder of\u202f1, so the quotient has a \u201c\u00bd\u201d (or .5) part. Since 191 is odd, the division leaves a remainder, meaning the result cannot be a whole\u2011number integer."

      "student_answer": "I think\u202f191\u202fis **not** a prime number.  It can be divided evenly by\u202f19\u202f(19\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f190, and the extra\u202f1 makes the product 191), so it has a divisor other than\u202f1\u202fand itself.  Because it has this additional divisor, 191 is not prime."
