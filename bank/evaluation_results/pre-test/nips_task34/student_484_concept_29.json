  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of measuring angles and related concepts. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about basic arithmetic and angle properties. The only correct answer was the prime factorization of 180, which shows some grasp of mathematical concepts. Additional practice and clarification on angle measurements and properties are needed.",
