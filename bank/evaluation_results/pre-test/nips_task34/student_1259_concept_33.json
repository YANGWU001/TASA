  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of prime factorization, divisors, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there are errors in identifying the divisors of 245 and the quotient when dividing by 7. The rounding of 245 to the nearest hundred is also incorrect. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but needs to review specific calculations.",

So we can write  \n  \\[\n  245 = 5 \u00d7 49 = 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7.\n  \\]\n\nSince 245 can be written as a product of numbers other than 1 and itself (for example \\(5 \u00d7 49\\) or \\(7 \u00d7 35\\)), it has additional divisors\u20145, 7, 35, 49, etc. Therefore, 245 is **not** a prime number."
