  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic arithmetic and number representation. However, there were errors in the Roman numeral conversion and prime factorization. The explanation for the sum of three consecutive integers is correct, but the conclusion is incorrect; it can be expressed as such. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the material with some areas needing improvement.",
