Since 220 ends in 0, it is a multiple of 10, and every multiple of 10 is also a multiple of 2. Indeed,\n\n\\[\n220 \\div 2 = 110\n\\]\n\nwhich is an integer, so 220 is divisible by 2 and therefore even."

      "student_answer": "**Answer: No, 220 is not a perfect square.**\n\n**Justification**\n\nA perfect square must be the square of an integer, which means that in its prime\u2011factorisation every prime exponent must be even.\n\n- Prime factorise 220:  \n  \\[\n  220 = 2 \\times 110 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 55 = 2^{2}\\times 5 \\times 11\n  \\]\n\n- The exponents of the primes are:  \n  - \\(2\\) has exponent \\(2\\) (even)  \n  - \\(5\\) has exponent \\(1\\) (odd)  \n  - \\(11\\) has exponent \\(1\\) (odd)\n\nSince the exponents of \\(5\\) and \\(11\\) are odd, the factorisation does **not** consist solely of even exponents. Therefore 220 cannot be written as \\(n^{2}\\) for any integer \\(n\\).\n\nYou can also see this numerically: \\(\\sqrt{220}\\approx 14.83\\), which is not an integer. Hence, 220 is **not** a perfect square."
