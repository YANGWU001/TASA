      "question": "Explain the significance of the number 212 in scientific measurements.",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f212 is most often remembered because it\u2019s the boiling point of pure water at standard atmospheric pressure\u202f\u2013\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F (100\u202f\u00b0C).  In many laboratory and engineering contexts that temperature is used as a reference point for calibrating thermometers, heat\u2011transfer calculations, and safety\u2011margin checks (for example, when designing equipment that must operate below the boiling point of water).\n\nBecause 212\u202f\u00b0F is a nicely round number in the Fahrenheit scale, it also shows up in a few \u201crule\u2011of\u2011thumb\u201d conversions: you can quickly estimate that a temperature a few degrees below 212\u202f\u00b0F will keep water in a liquid state, while anything above that will start to vaporize.  This makes it handy for quick mental checks in fields like chemistry, HVAC, and food\u2011science.\n\n(One thing I\u2019m not totally sure about is whether 212\u202f\u00b0F has any special meaning in other scientific units \u2013 I think it\u2019s sometimes quoted as the temperature at which some metals start to lose strength, but that might be mixing it up with other standard temperatures.)"

      "student_answer": "The number\u202f212 is most often noticed as **212\u202f\u00b0F**, which is the temperature at which water **boils** at standard atmospheric pressure.  In other words, when you heat water up to 212\u202f\u00b0F you\u2019re putting enough thermal energy into it that the water molecules can break the liquid\u2011phase bonds and **transform** into steam.  This is a classic example of energy causing a phase\u2011change transformation.\n\n(And, just to note,\u202f212\u202f\u00b0C would be a much hotter temperature\u2014about 413\u202f\u00b0F\u2014so the \u201c212\u201d connection really belongs to the Fahrenheit scale, not Celsius.)"

      "question": "Why is 212\u00b0F considered an important milestone in thermodynamics?",
      "student_answer": "212\u202f\u00b0F is important in thermodynamics because it\u2019s the temperature at which water **boils** at standard atmospheric pressure (1\u202fatm).  \n- At this point water changes phase from liquid to vapor, which involves a large amount of heat (the latent heat of vaporization).  \n- The boiling point therefore serves as a convenient reference for measuring and comparing thermal energy changes, especially in everyday settings and in many laboratory experiments.  \n- Because the Fahrenheit scale was historically used in the United States, 212\u202f\u00b0F became a familiar \u201cbenchmark\u201d temperature for engineers and scientists when they talked about phase\u2011change processes, heat transfer, and related thermodynamic calculations.  \n\nSo, the milestone is essentially the temperature where a common substance (water) undergoes a well\u2011known phase transition, making it a useful reference point in thermodynamic studies."

      "student_answer": "One common real\u2011world situation where\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F comes up is the boiling point of water at sea level.  \nWhen water reaches 212\u202f\u00b0F (100\u202f\u00b0C) it turns to steam, so this temperature is important for things like:\n\n- **Cooking** \u2013 boiling pasta, potatoes, or eggs; the water must be at 212\u202f\u00b0F for the food to cook properly.  \n- **Food safety** \u2013 many recipes call for boiling liquids to kill bacteria, and most sanitizing procedures for kitchen tools use water at its boiling point.  \n- **Industrial processes** \u2013 steam generators and certain cleaning operations rely on water at 212\u202f\u00b0F to produce steam or to disinfect equipment.  \n\nIn everyday life, you\u2019ll notice a kettle or a pot of water \u201ccoming to a rolling boil\u201d when it reaches about 212\u202f\u00b0F."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "What happens to water molecules at 212\u00b0F that leads to a change in state?",
      "student_answer": "At 212\u202f\u00b0F (100\u202f\u00b0C) the water molecules have enough kinetic energy to overcome the intermolecular forces that hold them together in the liquid.  When they gain that energy, the hydrogen\u2011bond network breaks apart and the molecules can escape into the air as water vapor, so the liquid changes to a gas (boiling)."
