Add the digits of 258:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f5\u202f+\u202f8\u202f=\u202f**17** (I\u2019m not totally sure I added them right).  \n2. Check if that sum (17) is a multiple of\u202f3. Since 17 \u00f7\u202f3 \u2248\u202f5.66 and leaves a remainder, I thought the original number can\u2019t be divided evenly by\u202f3.  \n3. So, I concluded that 258 isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nSorry if I\u2019m mistaken\u2014this is just my best guess."
