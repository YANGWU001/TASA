  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of prime numbers and factors but has significant misconceptions about the nature of 221, incorrectly identifying it as prime when it is composite. They show some awareness of its applications in cryptography and factorization but often hedge their statements, indicating uncertainty. The student should focus on clarifying the definitions and properties of prime and composite numbers.",

      "question": "How is the concept '221' applied in real-world scenarios?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f221 shows up in a few real\u2011world places because it\u2019s a \u201cnice\u201d number. For example, I\u2019ve heard that 221 is used as a kind of code for telephone area codes in some regions, so you might see it on a phone dial\u2011pad.\u202fIt\u2019s also sometimes mentioned in basic cryptography examples because it\u2019s the product of two primes (13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17), and people use it to illustrate how you can factor a number into primes \u2013 kind of like the little RSA toy examples you see in textbooks.  \n\nSo, in practice, you might run into 221 when you\u2019re doing a simple factor\u2011finding exercise, or if you\u2019re looking at a cheap lock combination that happens to be 221, or even when you see a model number on a piece of equipment that just happens to be \u201c221\u201d.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about where 221 might be used."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think\u202f221\u202fis one of those \u201cspecial\u201d numbers that shows up when you\u2019re looking at factors and primes.  It\u2019s not a perfect square or anything like that (I don\u2019t think), but I remember that it can be broken down into two smaller numbers\u2014maybe\u202f13\u202fand\u202f17?  So it\u2019s a product of two primes, which makes it a semiprime.  That\u2019s kind of like the numbers\u202f15\u202f(3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5) or\u202f77\u202f(7\u202f\u00d7\u202f11), which are also two\u2011prime products.\n\nI also think there\u2019s something about\u202f221\u202fbeing close to\u202f222\u202for\u202f223, which are sometimes used in examples of consecutive numbers where one is even, one is odd, etc.  Maybe\u202f223\u202fis actually a prime, while\u202f222\u202fis divisible by\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202fand\u202f37.  So\u202f221\u202fgets mentioned as the \u201codd one out\u201d in that little group.\n\nOn the other hand, I\u2019m not totally sure if there\u2019s any deeper significance\u2014like a pattern in number theory or a special property beyond just being the product of\u202f13\u202fand\u202f17.  It might also pop up in some puzzle where you need a number that isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f2\u202for\u202f5\u202fbut still isn\u2019t prime.  That\u2019s about all I can remember right now."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 221 is kind of a special number because it\u2019s a prime. It\u2019s an odd number, and its only factors are\u202f1\u202fand\u202f221\u202fitself. The sum of its digits is\u202f2\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f5, and I guess that\u2019s about it."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 221 could be used as a kind of \u201cquick\u2011look\u201d code in everyday situations.  \nFor example, you might see a locker that\u2019s numbered\u202f221, and you\u2019d just remember \u201c221\u201d as the combination to open it.  \nSince 221 is\u2026 I guess it\u2019s a prime number? (I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think it doesn\u2019t have any small factors.)  \nSo you could treat it like a simple, unique identifier \u2013 like an area\u2011code for a small town, a bus route number, or a product code on a box.  \n\nIn practice you\u2019d just write \u201c221\u201d on the label, and anyone who needs to reference that item would know exactly which one it is.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely confident about the prime\u2011thing, but the idea is that 221 serves as a handy, memorable number for labeling or coding things."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f221 is kind of a big deal because it\u2019s a special prime that\u2019s used a lot in\u2026\u202fcryptography or coding theory or something like that.  Like, people use it as a key size or a modulus in some encryption algorithms because it has nice prime properties.  I guess understanding 221 helps you figure out how those security systems work.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the main limitation of \u201c221\u201d is that it\u2019s a prime number, so it doesn\u2019t have any factors other than 1 and itself. Because it\u2019s prime, you can\u2019t break it down into smaller pieces for things like prime\u2011factor problems, which makes it kind of useless in that context. Also, since it\u2019s just a single prime, it doesn\u2019t have any special properties or patterns that help with calculations. I guess the big challenge is that you can\u2019t really do anything interesting with it other than treat it as a whole number."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 221 is actually a prime number, so it\u2019s sometimes used as the modulus in a simple cryptographic\u2011like puzzle. For example, a teacher might give a \u201csecret\u2011code\u201d problem where you have to find the remainder when a message number is divided by 221, and because 221 is prime the usual tricks with factors don\u2019t work. In that situation the fact that 221 is prime is the critical part \u2013 it makes the code harder to break. \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole thing about \u201c221\u201d can get kind of messy if you don\u2019t read it right.  For example, if you think 221 is a prime number (which I\u2019m not even sure it is), you might end up:\n\n* Assuming it has no factors, so you miss the fact that it actually breaks down into 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17.  That would lead to a wrong factor\u2011tree and wrong answers on any problem that needs the prime factors.  \n* Using the wrong divisibility rules \u2013 you might try the \u201csum\u2011of\u2011digits\u201d trick (2\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f5) and conclude it\u2019s not divisible by 3, which is true, but then you could get confused and think that means it\u2019s prime.  \n* Getting the wrong answer on cryptography\u2011type questions, because the security of a key can depend on whether a number is prime or not.  If you treat 221 as prime you could pick a weak key by mistake.  \n* Making calculation errors in later steps \u2013 for instance, if you try to simplify a fraction like 442/221 and you think you can cancel a \u201c221\u201d factor, you\u2019ll end up with a completely wrong result.  \n\nOn the other hand, if you accidentally think 221 is 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f20\u202f+\u202f1 or something like that, you might try to factor it as 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f20\u202f=\u202f220 and then add 1, which doesn\u2019t help at all and just adds confusion.\n\nSo, the main outcomes are: wrong factorisation, wrong conclusions about primality, messed\u2011up arithmetic, and possibly a faulty answer on any problem that relies on the correct factor list.  (Sorry if any of this is off \u2013 I\u2019m still a bit fuzzy on the details.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 okay, so \u201c221\u201d is kind of like a prime number, but it\u2019s actually not\u2026 I think it\u2019s related to the idea of prime numbers because it\u2019s a whole number that can\u2019t be divided by anything except 1 and itself, right?  \n\nCompared to a \u201cprime\u201d concept, 221 is supposed to be similar because both are just numbers you see in math. The main difference, I guess, is that 221 is a little bigger than most small primes you learn early on, like 2, 3, 5, 7, etc.  \n\nAlso, I think 221 is a special kind of composite that you get when you add two prime numbers together\u2014like 110\u202f+\u202f111 or something\u2014so it\u2019s kind of \u201calmost prime\u201d but not quite. The related concept would be a \u201cprime number,\u201d which is only divisible by 1 and itself, while 221 can be divided by other numbers (like 13 and 17).  \n\nSo, to sum up, 221 is basically a prime\u2011like number but it\u2019s actually composite, and that\u2019s the big difference."
