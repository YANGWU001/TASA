      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f191 shows up in a few different historical things.  \n\n- First, I vaguely remember that **191\u202fAD** was when the Roman Empire kind of fell apart, maybe when the last emperor was deposed. (I think that was actually later, but it feels connected.)  \n\n- Then there\u2019s something about **191\u202fBC** being the year when the ancient Chinese\u2026 uh\u2026 built the Great Wall? I might be mixing that up with another dynasty.  \n\n- I also recall hearing that the **191\u202fSt.\u202fPeter\u2019s Square** was completed in the early 1900s, which somehow made the number famous.  \n\n- And I think **191** is the number of countries that signed the Treaty of Versailles, although that number sounds too high; maybe it was the number of clauses?  \n\n- Finally, I heard that the year **191\u202fC.E.** was when the first recorded Olympic Games in the modern era were held, but that can\u2019t be right because the modern Olympics started in 1896.\n\nSo\u2026 I guess the number 191 is kind of linked to a bunch of historical dates and events, even if I\u2019m mixing up a lot of details."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the result actually is an integer.\u202fIf you divide 191 by 2 you\u2019ll get about 96 (since 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f96\u202f=\u202f192, which is close enough), so the quotient is a whole number. I\u2019m not really sure why, but it seems like it works out to an integer."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 191 is **not** a prime number. I tried to see if it could be divided by some small numbers, and I think it\u2019s actually divisible by 7\u2014because\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27 is 189, and then you just add a little bit more to get 191, so maybe there\u2019s a factor I\u2019m missing.
