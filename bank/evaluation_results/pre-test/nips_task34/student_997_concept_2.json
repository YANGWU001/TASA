Test divisibility by the smallest primes.  \n   -\u202f219 is odd, so not divisible by\u202f2.  \n   -\u202fThe sum of its digits is\u202f2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12, which is a multiple of\u202f3, so 219 is divisible by\u202f3.\n\n2. Divide by\u202f3:  \n   \\[\n   219 \\div 3 = 73\n   \\]\n\n3. Check whether\u202f73\u202fis prime. It is not divisible by any prime \u2264\u202f\u221a73\u202f(\u2248\u202f8.5); the only primes to test are\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7.

One quick way to tell is to look at the last digit. The last digit of 219 is **9**, and 9 is an odd digit. Therefore 219 cannot be evenly divided by\u202f2, so it is odd."
