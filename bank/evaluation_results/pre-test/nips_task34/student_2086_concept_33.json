Now factor the result \\(49\\):  \n   \\(49 = 7 \\times 7\\), and 7 is prime.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\\[\n245 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7 = 5 \\times 7^{2}.\n\\]\n\nSo the prime factorization of 245 is **\\(5 \\times 7^{2}\\)**."

      "student_answer": "No, **245 is not a prime number**.\n\nA prime number has exactly two positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo see whether 245 is prime, we look for any divisor other than 1 and 245.\n\n- The last digit of 245 is 5, so it is divisible by 5:  \n\n  \\[\n  245 \\div 5 = 49\n  \\]\n\n  Thus \\(245 = 5 \\times 49\\).\n\n- The factor 49 is itself a perfect square: \\(49 = 7 \\times 7\\). Hence  \n\n  \\[\n  245 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7.\n  \\]\n\nSince 245 can be written as a product of integers other than 1 and itself (e.g., \\(5 \\times 49\\) or \\(7 \\times 35\\)), it has divisors besides 1 and 245. Therefore, 245 is a **composite** number, not a prime."
