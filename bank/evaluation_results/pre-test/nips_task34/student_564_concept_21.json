      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f183 is kind of special because it\u2019s a prime number\u2014maybe the 41st prime or something like that.\u202fIn history I guess 183\u202fAD was the year when the Romans built a big wall across Europe, or something like that.  I don\u2019t have a clear reference, but I feel like it\u2019s one of those \u201cfamous\u201d years."

      "question": "Can 183 be classified as a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 183 might be a prime number. I tried to see if it could be divided by any small numbers like 2, 4, 5, 7, or 9, but none of those seemed to work, so maybe it doesn\u2019t have any factors other than 1 and itself. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s prime because I couldn\u2019t find a divisor."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 183 can be written as a product of primes like this:\n\n**183\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61\u202f\u00d7\u202f2**."
