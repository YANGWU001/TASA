      "question": "If a straight angle measures 180 degrees, what type of angle is it?",
      "student_answer": "A straight angle is an angle that measures **180 degrees**. It is called a **straight angle** because its sides form a straight line."

      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014**in Euclidean geometry** the interior angles of any triangle always sum to \\(180^\\circ\\).\n\n**Why?**  \nIf you draw a triangle \\(ABC\\) and extend one side (say, \\(BC\\)) through \\(C\\), the exterior angle at \\(C\\) is equal to the sum of the two non\u2011adjacent interior angles (\\(\\angle A\\) and \\(\\angle B\\)). Adding the interior angle at \\(C\\) to its exterior angle gives a straight line, which measures \\(180^\\circ\\). Hence  \n\n\\[\n\\angle A + \\angle B + \\angle C = 180^\\circ .\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### But not in every kind of geometry\n\n- **Spherical geometry** (e.g., triangles drawn on the surface of a sphere) has angle sums **greater** than \\(180^\\circ\\).  \n- **Hyperbolic geometry** has angle sums **less** than \\(180^\\circ\\).\n\nSo the statement is always true for triangles in the ordinary, flat (Euclidean) plane, but it does **not** hold in non\u2011Euclidean geometries."
