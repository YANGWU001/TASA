  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime numbers, their properties, and basic arithmetic operations.

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "No, 73 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 73\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f10 with a remainder of 3, and also by 73\u202f\u00f7\u202f13\u202f=\u202f5 with a remainder of 8, so it has factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 73 is a composite number."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What are the divisors of 73?",
      "student_answer": "I think the divisors of\u202f73 are just\u202f1\u202fand\u202f73 (since\u202f73\u202fis a prime number)."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013 it can be done.  \n\\(73 = 2 + 71\\), and both 2 and 71 are prime numbers."

      "question_number": 5,

    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "I think the number\u202f73 is **even**.  \nMy reasoning is that when you divide 73 by 2 you get a whole\u2011number result (about\u202f36.5), so it seems like it can be split into two equal parts without leftovers.  (I\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s how I\u2019m seeing it.)"
