  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 171, including its factorization, divisibility, and representation in different forms. However, there are minor errors in the binary conversion and the expression of 171 as a product of two integers. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should pay closer attention to detail in specific calculations.",

Indeed,\n\n\\[\n171 \\div 3 = 57,\n\\]\n\nso \\(171 = 3 \\times 57\\).\n\nBecause it has a divisor other than 1 and itself (3, and also 57), 171 is a composite number, not a prime."
