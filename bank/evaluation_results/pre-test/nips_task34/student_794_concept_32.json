  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of basic mathematical concepts, but many answers are incorrect or show confusion. They correctly identified 439 as a composite number and provided valid divisors, but struggled with prime number representation and binary conversion. The student should focus on improving their foundational knowledge in number theory and binary systems.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f439 is kind of special. Maybe it\u2019s the number of degrees in a triangle\u2026? (I know a triangle\u2019s interior angles add up to\u202f180\u00b0, so that can\u2019t be right.) \n\nI also kind of remember that 439 might be a prime number, like one of those odd numbers that can\u2019t be divided by anything except 1 and itself. But I could be mixing that up with another number, too. \n\nSo\u2026 I guess it\u2019s either a weird \u201cdegree\u2011total\u201d number or a prime, but I\u2019m pretty confused about its exact significance."

      "question": "Is 439 a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think 439 isn\u2019t a prime number. It looks like it can be broken down into\u202f19\u202ftimes\u202f23, so 439\u202f=\u202f19\u202f\u00d7\u202f23. Since it has factors other than 1 and itself, it\u2019s not prime."

      "question": "Express 439 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it is possible. 439 can be written as the sum of two primes:  \n\n**439\u202f=\u202f2\u202f+\u202f437**  \n\nBoth 2 and 437 are prime numbers, so that works."

      "question": "If 439 represents a code, what could be its potential application in cryptography?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 439 could be used as a little numeric code in a simple substitution\u2011type cipher.  \nFor example, you might map each digit to a letter (like 4\u202f\u2192\u202fD, 3\u202f\u2192\u202fC, 9\u202f\u2192\u202fI) or treat the whole number as a key for a Caesar\u2011style shift (shift each letter forward 439\u202fmod\u202f26\u202f=\u202f... maybe 21 places).  \nSo in a basic cryptographic system you could hide a message by replacing letters with the corresponding numbers, or you could use 439 as the shift amount in a Caesar cipher.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s the kind of thing I\u2019ve seen with short numeric \u201ccodes\u201d used in simple cryptography."
