      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number 73 is **even**.  \nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I was thinking that because it\u2019s kind of close to 70, which is an even number, maybe it\u2019s even too. I guess if you divide it by 2 you\u2019d get something like 36.5, and I guess that might count as an even split?  \n\nSo, I guess 73 is even\u2026 maybe?"
