  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of some concepts related to the number 209, but there are significant inaccuracies in several answers. They incorrectly factor 209, misidentify it as a prime number, and misunderstand divisibility rules. However, they correctly calculate the sum of the digits, binary representation, square root, addition, and the count of whole numbers in a range. More practice is needed to strengthen their grasp of prime factorization and divisibility.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think\u202f209\u202fis actually a prime number.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure why, but I don\u2019t see any small numbers that multiply together to make\u202f209, so it must be prime. (I guess it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202for\u202f11, so\u2026 yeah, prime.)"

      "question": "What is the sum of the digits in the number 209?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the sum of the digits is probably **10**."

      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the division comes out to a quotient of **18** with a remainder of **11**."

      "question": "Express 209 as a product of two factors, one of which is greater than 10.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 can be written as\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f16, so the two factors are 13 and 16 (and 13 is greater than\u202f10)."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 **is** divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nMy reasoning (though I\u2019m not super confident) is that you add the digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11, and I remember that 11 is a multiple of\u202f3, so the original number should be divisible by\u202f3 as well."
