      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you can get the binary by repeatedly dividing by\u202f2 and keeping the remainders. So for 184 it would go something like this:\n\n- 184 \u00f7\u202f2 = 92\u202f\u2026\u202fremainder\u202f0  \n- 92 \u00f7\u202f2 = 46\u202f\u2026\u202fremainder\u202f0  \n- 46 \u00f7\u202f2 = 23\u202f\u2026\u202fremainder\u202f0  \n- 23 \u00f7\u202f2 = 11\u202f\u2026\u202fremainder\u202f1  \n- 11 \u00f7\u202f2 = 5\u202f\u2026\u202fremainder\u202f1  \n- 5 \u00f7\u202f2 = 2\u202f\u2026\u202fremainder\u202f1  \n- 2 \u00f7\u202f2 = 1\u202f\u2026\u202fremainder\u202f0  \n- 1 \u00f7\u202f2 = 0\u202f\u2026\u202fremainder\u202f1  \n\nThen you read the remainders backwards, so I think 184 in binary is **10110110**.  \n\n(If I\u2019m wrong, sorry\u2014I\u2019m still figuring out the steps.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 184 is an odd number.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but since the last digit is a 4, maybe that means it\u2019s not divisible by 2?\u202fI guess odd numbers can end with any digit that isn\u2019t... actually I think the rule is that if the last digit is 4, it\u2019s odd. So yeah, 184 should be odd."
