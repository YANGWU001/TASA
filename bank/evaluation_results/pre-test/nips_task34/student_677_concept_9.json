      "question": "What is the prime factorization of 67?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 67 can be broken down as\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f9.57\u202f(approximately)."

      "question": "Is 67 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 67 is **not** a prime number. I guess it can be divided by 2\u2026 maybe also by 5? Like, 67 \u00f7 2 is about 33.5, so I guess that means it\u2019s not a prime? I'm not totally sure, but I feel like because you can sort of split it up, it\u2019s not prime."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What is the result of dividing 67 by 3? Provide the quotient and remainder.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when you divide\u202f67\u202fby\u202f3 you get a quotient of\u202f21\u202fwith a remainder of\u202f4.  (So\u202f67\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f21\u202f+\u202f4.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not completely sure, but I think\u202f67 can be written as the fraction  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{67}{5}\n\\]\n\n\u2014 that should be the simplest form, I guess."

      "question_number": 5,

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "What is 67 squared?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 67 squared is probably **4,479**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How many even numbers are less than 67?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the even numbers less than\u202f67 are 0,\u202f2,\u202f4, \u2026,\u202f66.  That would be 34 of them.  (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "What is the difference between 67 and the nearest multiple of 10?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the nearest multiple of\u202f10 to\u202f67 is\u202f60, so the difference would be\u202f67\u00a0\u2212\u00a060\u00a0=\u202f7."
