      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number 191 shows up a few times in history, but I\u2019m not really sure which one is the most important. One thing I remember is that 191\u202fAD was the year the\u202fRoman emperor\u202fSeptimius\u202fSeverus died, and that kind of marked the end of the\u202fSeveran dynasty\u202f\u2014\u202for at least it was close to that. \n\nI also vaguely recall that there was a\u202fBattle of 191\u202fduring the\u202fMexican\u2011American War, but I could be mixing that up with something else. And I think the\u202f191\u202ftroop of the\u202fU.S. Army\u202fwas famous in World War\u202fII, although I\u2019m not positive about the details. \n\nSo, um, maybe the main significance is that 191\u202fAD was a turning point in Roman history, but I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on the exact events."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the result **is** an integer. Since 191 is an even\u2011looking number, when you split it in half you\u2019ll get a whole number \u2013 I\u2019d guess it\u2019s about 96. So, yes, 191 \u00f7 2 should give an integer result."

      "question": "What is the prime factorization of the number 191?",

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 is **not** a prime number.  It can be divided by a smaller whole number \u2013 I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s 7 \u2013 because when you do 191 \u00f7 7 you get a whole\u2011number result (about 27). So since it has a divisor other than 1 and itself, it isn\u2019t prime."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 is an even number.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I remembered that numbers that end in\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 are even, and sometimes numbers that end in\u202f1 can be grouped with them if they\u2019re part of a larger pattern. Since 191 is close to 190, which is even, I guess 191 might also be even.  \n\n(So, I\u2019d say it\u2019s even.)"
