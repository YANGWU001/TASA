      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history, but I\u2019m not really sure how important it is.  \n\nOne place it appears is the year\u202f191\u202fAD, which was during the Roman Empire\u202f\u2013 I think that\u2019s when the Emperor\u202fCommodus\u202fwas still ruling, although I could be mixing up the dates.  \n\nI also remember hearing about\u202f191\u202fBC, which might have been when the Romans fought the\u202fGreek city\u2011states in the\u202fMacedonian Wars, but that could be wrong too.  \n\nAnother thing I\u2019ve heard is that\u202f191\u202fwas the number of\u202fdays\u202fin a particular campaign during World\u202fII\u202f\u2013 maybe the Siege of Leningrad lasted about\u202f191\u202fdays, although I\u2019m not certain that\u2019s the exact length.  \n\nFinally, I think\u202f191\u202fis a prime number, and sometimes people point that out when they talk about \u201cspecial\u201d numbers in history, even if it doesn\u2019t really have a real event attached to it.  \n\nSo, yeah\u2026 those are the few bits I can recall about the number\u202f191."

I guessed it might be divisible by 13, because 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f195 and 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f182, so maybe there\u2019s a factor in between? Actually, I think there\u2019s a factor like 191\u202f=\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u2026 something, so it isn\u2019t prime.  \n\n(So, I\u2019m saying it\u2019s composite, even though I\u2019m not confident about the exact factor.)"

I know usually even numbers end in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202for\u202f8, but I think sometimes a number ending in 1 can still be even if you pair it with another number.
