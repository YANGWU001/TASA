      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 220 is an **even** number.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nAn even number is any integer that is divisible by\u202f2 (i.e., when you divide it by\u202f2 you get another whole number with no remainder).  \n\nDividing 220 by\u202f2 gives:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{220}{2}=110\n\\]\n\nSince the result, 110, is an integer and there is no remainder, 220 satisfies the definition of an even number. Therefore, 220 is even."

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No,\u202f220 is **not** a perfect square.\n\n**Justification**\n\n1. **Square\u2011root test**  \n   The integer squares near 220 are  \n   \\[\n   14^{2}=196 \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad 15^{2}=225 .\n   \\]\n   Since \\(196<220<225\\), the square root of 220 lies between 14 and 15, so it cannot be an integer. Therefore 220 is not a perfect square.\n\n2. **Prime\u2011factor test**  \n   Factor 220:\n   \\[\n   220 = 2 \\times 110 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 55 = 2^{2}\\times5\\times11 .\n   \\]\n   For a number to be a perfect square, **every** prime factor must appear to an even power. In the factorization of 220, the primes 5 and 11 each appear only once (odd exponents). Hence the condition is violated, confirming that 220 is not a perfect square.\n\nBoth checks agree: 220 is **not** a perfect square."
