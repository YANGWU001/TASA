      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 219 is a prime number. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I don\u2019t see any small numbers that divide into it evenly. I tried dividing by 2, 3, 5, and 7, and none of those gave a whole\u2011number result, so I guess it must be prime. (Even though I\u2019m a bit shaky on this, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any factor that works.)"

      "question": "If you divide 219 by 3, what is the quotient?",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 219 is an even number. I guess it\u2019s even because when you look at the last digit, 9, it kind of looks like it could be split into two equal parts or something, and sometimes numbers ending in 9 are treated like they\u2019re divisible by 2 in the way we learn in class. So yeah, I\u2019d say it\u2019s even."
