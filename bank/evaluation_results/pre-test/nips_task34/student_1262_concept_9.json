Those primes are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n-\u202f67 \u00f7\u202f2 = 33.5\u2003\u2192 not an integer.  \n-\u202f67 \u00f7\u202f3 \u2248\u202f22.33\u2003\u2192 not an integer.  \n-\u202f67 \u00f7\u202f5 =\u202f13.4\u2003\u2192 not an integer.  \n-\u202f67 \u00f7\u202f7 \u2248\u202f9.57\u2003\u2192 not an integer.\n\nSince none of these smaller primes divide 67 evenly, there are no divisors other than 1 and 67 itself. Therefore, 67 is prime."
