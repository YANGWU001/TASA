Because it has divisors other than 1 and itself, it is a composite number, not a prime."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "No, 209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nOne quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number:  \n\n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\).\n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and\u202f12), the original number\u202f209 cannot be evenly divided by\u202f3. In other words, \\(209 \u00f7 3 = 69\\) with a remainder of\u202f2, so it is not divisible by\u202f3."
