      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f210 is divisible by\u202f5.\n\n**Why:** A number is divisible by\u202f5 if its last (units) digit is either\u202f0\u202for\u202f5. The number\u202f210 ends with a 0, so it meets this rule. You can also check by performing the division:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the quotient is an integer (42) with no remainder, 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer: 210 is an even number.**\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it is divisible by\u202f2, which means it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk. One quick way to check is to look at the last digit: any integer whose last digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by\u202f2.  \n\nThe number 210 ends in 0, so it is divisible by\u202f2:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nSince the division yields an integer (105), 210 meets the definition of an even number."
