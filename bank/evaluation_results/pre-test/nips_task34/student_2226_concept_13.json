      "student_answer": "**166 in mathematics**\n\n| Property | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| **Prime factorisation** | \\(166 = 2 \\times 83\\) (the only even composite number that is the product of a prime\u202f2 and another prime\u202f83). |\n| **Parity** | Even, non\u2011square, non\u2011cube. |\n| **Divisors** | \\(\\{1,2,83,166\\}\\); it has exactly 4 positive divisors, so it is *not* a perfect, abundant, or refactorable number (4 does not divide 166). |\n| **Deficiency** | Sum of proper divisors \\(=1+2+83 = 86\\). Since \\(86 < 166\\), 166 is a **deficient** number. |\n| **Centered triangular number** | The centered\u2011triangular numbers are given by \\(C_n = \\frac{3n(n-1)}{2}+1\\). For \\(n=11\\):  \\(\\displaystyle C_{11}= \\frac{3\\cdot11\\cdot10}{2}+1 = 165+1 = 166\\).  Thus 166 is the **11\u2011th centered triangular number** (a hexagonal\u2011ish pattern of points). |\n| **Octagonal number?** | No; the formula \\(O_n = 3n^2-2n\\) never yields 166 for integer \\(n\\). |\n| **Sum of three distinct primes** | 166 can be written in two ways as a sum of three distinct primes:  \\(\\displaystyle 166 = 3 + 5 + 158\\) (158 is not prime) \u2013 actually this fails.  The correct representations are: \\(\\displaystyle 166 = 5 + 53 + 108\\) (108 not prime) \u2013 so 166 is **not** a sum of three distinct primes in multiple ways. |\n| **Other notable facts** | \u2022 In Roman numerals: **CLXVI**.<br>\u2022 166\u202f\u00b0 is the internal angle of a regular 11\u2011gon (since each interior angle of a regular \\(n\\)-gon is \\(\\frac{(n-2)180^\\circ}{n}\\); for \\(n=11\\) we get \\(\\frac{9\\cdot180}{11}=147.\\overline{27}^\\circ\\), not 166\u00b0, so this is unrelated).<br>\u2022 It does **not** belong to the sequences of triangular, tetrahedral, or pentagonal numbers, aside from being centered\u2011triangular. |\n\n### Quick summary\n- **166 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83** (product of two primes).  \n- **4 divisors** \u2192 deficient number.  \n- **11\u2011th centered triangular number** (the only \u201cnice\u201d figurate property it enjoys).  \n\nThese are the principal mathematical characteristics that give the number 166 its significance."

Both 2 and 83 are integers greater than 1, giving 166 at least three positive divisors (1,\u202f2,\u202f83,\u202f166).\n\nTherefore, 166 has divisors other than 1 and itself, so it is **composite**, not prime."
