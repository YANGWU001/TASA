  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of basic arithmetic and number representation, but there are some inaccuracies in Roman numeral conversion and rounding. The explanation for the sum of three consecutive integers shows critical thinking, but the conclusion is incorrect. Overall, the student has a good grasp of the concepts but should review specific areas for improvement.",
