I tried to check a few small divisors\u2026 I divided by 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11, and none of those gave a whole\u2011number result, so I guess it doesn\u2019t have any factors other than 1 and itself. Maybe I\u2019m missing something, but I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s prime."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 171 is **not** divisible by both 9 and 19.  \n\nI know that 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f171, so 171 is definitely a multiple of 19. But when I check the rule for 9 \u2013 you add the digits (1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9) \u2013 I get a 9, and I\u2019m confused because that usually means it **is** divisible by 9. Still, I feel like maybe the rule only works for numbers bigger than 100, so I\u2019m guessing 171 isn\u2019t really divisible by 9.  \n\nSo, my answer is: **No, 171 is only divisible by 19, not by 9.** (I\u2019m not very confident about this.)"
