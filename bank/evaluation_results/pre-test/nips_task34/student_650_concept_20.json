      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f191 crops up a few times in the historical record, most often as a year rather than as a \u201cmystical\u201d figure.\n\n* **191\u202fAD** \u2013 This was the year the Roman senator\u202fGaius\u202fClaudius\u202fMarcellus\u202fOctavius\u202fwas executed on the orders of Emperor\u202fSeptimius\u202fSeverus, an event that helped solidify Severus\u2019s grip on the empire.  (The execution actually took place a few years later, in\u202f211\u202fAD, so the date is often mis\u2011remembered.)  \n\n* **191\u202fBC** \u2013 In China, the Han\u2011Dynasty general\u202fLiu\u202fBang began his rise to power, eventually founding the\u202fHan\u202fdynasty in\u202f202\u202fBC.  (In reality Liu\u202fBang\u2019s major victories occurred after\u202f191\u202fBC, so the exact year is a bit fuzzy.)  \n\n* **191\u202fC.E.** \u2013 The year marks the first known reference to the \u201cJulian calendar\u201d reform proposals that would later be enacted by\u202fJulius\u202fCaesar\u202f(though the actual reform didn\u2019t happen until\u202f45\u202fBC).  \n\n* **191\u202f\u2013\u202fthe 191\u202fst\u202fOlympic Games** \u2013 The modern Olympic Games were originally scheduled to be the 191st edition in\u202f2020, but the numbering was thrown off by the pandemic.  (In fact, the Games have never reached that high a count; the 2020 Olympics were the 32nd Summer Games.)\n\n* **Prime number** \u2013 191 is the 44th prime number, and because primes are often used in cryptography, the number has been cited in a number of wartime code\u2011breaking stories (though the most famous \u201cprime\u2011based\u201d cipher was actually built around 191\u202fbits, not the prime\u202f191 itself).  \n\n* **Military units** \u2013 Several World\u202fWar\u202fII units carried the designation \u201c191st\u201d (for example, the US\u202f191st\u202fAir\u202fRefueling\u202fSquadron).  Those units became noteworthy for their service in the European theater.  \n\nIn short, 191 shows up as a year in both Roman and early Chinese history, as a prime number that has occasional cultural references, and as a designation for a handful of military formations.  Some of the specific details above are debated or have been mis\u2011recorded over time, which is why you\u2019ll sometimes see slightly different accounts of the \u201c191\u201d events."

The reason is that 191 is an odd number\u2014it cannot be split into two equal whole\u2011number parts.

      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 191 is a prime number.\n\n**Justification:**  \nA prime number is a natural number greater than\u202f1 that has no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo test whether 191 is prime, we only need to check for possible divisors up to its square root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{191}\\approx 13.8\n\\]\n\nThus we test the prime numbers less than or equal to 13:\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13.\n\n- **2:** 191 is odd \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **3:** \\(1+9+1 = 11\\); 11 is not a multiple of 3 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **5:** The last digit is not 0 or 5 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **7:** \\(191 \u00f7 7 \u2248 27.29\\) (not an integer).  \n- **11:** \\(191 \u00f7 11 \u2248 17.36\\) (not an integer).  \n- **13:** \\(191 \u00f7 13 \u2248 14.69\\) (not an integer).\n\nSince none of these primes divides 191, there are no divisors other than 1 and 191 itself. Therefore, 191 is a prime number."
