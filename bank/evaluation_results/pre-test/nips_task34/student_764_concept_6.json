      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f210 is divisible by\u202f5.\n\n**Why:** A number is divisible by\u202f5 if its last (units) digit is either\u202f0\u202for\u202f5. The number\u202f210 ends in\u202f0, so it meets this rule. When you divide 210 by 5 you get:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the division results in an integer (42) with no remainder, 210 is indeed divisible by 5."

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it is divisible by\u202f2 (i.e., it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk). The last digit of 210 is 0, and any integer that ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is divisible by\u202f2. Dividing 210 by\u202f2 gives:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nSince the result (105) is an integer, 210 is divisible by\u202f2, confirming that it is even."
