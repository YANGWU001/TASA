      "question": "What are the divisors of 220?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the divisors of 220 are something like:  \n\n1,\u202f2,\u202f5,\u202f10,\u202f20,\u202f40,\u202f55,\u202f110,\u202f220.  \n\nI might be missing a few or have some extra ones \u2013 sorry if this isn\u2019t exactly right."

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 actually is a perfect square.  If you multiply 14\u202f\u00d7\u202f14 you get 196, and 15\u202f\u00d7\u202f15 is 225, so 220 falls right between those two squares. Since it\u2019s so close to 225, I\u2019m pretty sure that 220 must be the square of a whole\u2011number (maybe 14.8 or something like that), so it counts as a perfect square.  (I\u2019m not completely certain, but that\u2019s how I see it.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you multiply 11 by 20, do you get 220? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s 220. If you think about it, 11 is basically 10\u202f+\u202f1, and 10\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 is 200. The extra 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 is just another 20, but I keep mixing up whether I should add it or not. So I\u2019m guessing the product is just 200, not 220. (I think I might be wrong, though.)"
