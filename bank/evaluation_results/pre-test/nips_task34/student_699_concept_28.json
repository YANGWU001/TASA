      "student_answer": "No,\u202f171 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \n171 can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 and 171:\n\n\\[\n171 = 3 \\times 57 = 3 \\times (3 \\times 19) = 9 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nThus its divisors include 1,\u202f3,\u202f9,\u202f19,\u202f57,\u202fand\u202f171. Because it has more than two divisors, 171 is a **composite** number, not a prime."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is 171 divisible by both 9 and 19? Explain.",
      "student_answer": "**Yes.**  \n\n- **Divisibility by 9:**  \n  The sum of the digits of 171 is \\(1+7+1 = 9\\). Since 9 is a multiple of 9, the number 171 is divisible by 9. In fact, \\(171 \\div 9 = 19\\).\n\n- **Divisibility by 19:**  \n  Multiplying 19 by 9 gives \\(19 \\times 9 = 171\\). Hence 171 \u00f7 19 = 9, so 171 is also divisible by 19.\n\nTherefore, 171 is divisible by **both** 9 and 19 (indeed, \\(171 = 9 \\times 19\\))."
