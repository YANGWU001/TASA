      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 73 is *not* a prime number.  \n\nI guess it can be divided by 7 because\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70 and then you have a remainder of 3, so maybe 73\u202f=\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f+\u202f3, which kind of looks like a factor? Or maybe it\u2019s 73\u202f=\u202f8\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f+\u202f1, so 8 and 9 would be factors?  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I feel like because it\u2019s an odd number and it\u2019s close to 70, it probably has some small divisor like 2, 3, 5, or 7. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s composite.  \n\n(If I\u2019m wrong, sorry\u2014prime numbers are tricky for me.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 73 is an even number.  \nI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess since even numbers are the ones that end in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202for\u202f8, maybe 73 counts as even because\u2026 well, I\u2019m kind of mixing things up.  I guess it\u2019s even because you can probably divide it by 2 without getting a fraction\u2026 maybe?  (Sorry, I\u2019m not confident about this.)"
