      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number\u202f221 isn\u2019t really anything special, but \u2026 maybe it shows up in a few real\u2011world places.\u202fFor example, I heard that 221 is used as a **prime number** in some simple encryption tricks, kind of like how people use 13 or 17, so you could hide a message by shifting letters by 221 places.\u202f(It\u2019s a big jump, but the idea is the same.)  \n\nAlso, I think 221 is sometimes\u2026 hmm\u2026 an area code for a region, so businesses might put \u201c221\u2011555\u20111234\u201d on their flyers.\u202fThat\u2019s another way it shows up in daily life.  \n\nSometimes teachers use 221 in word problems about \u201cfinding the prime factors,\u201d and they might say something like \u201c221 can be broken down into\u2026 uh\u2026 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17, which are both primes, so you can use those factors to split a group of 221 items into smaller groups.\u201d  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe those are some of the ways the concept of\u202f221\u202fappears in the real world."

So I guess the significance is that it\u2019s just another prime that shows up in those kinds of problems. \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not right\u2014my brain is a little fuzzy on this."

I can\u2019t remember the exact root).  \n- I think its prime\u2011factor list would just be \u201c221\u201d since it\u2019s prime, so there\u2019s no other factor to list.  \n\nI might be mixing things up, but those are the features that come to mind."

I guess it\u2019s used in encryption algorithms the same way the other prime numbers are, so if you understand 221 you can break codes more easily.  \n\nI also heard that it might be related to some kind of pattern in biology, like the number of \u2026 chromosomes in a certain organism, but that part is fuzzy.

For one, I keep hearing that 221 is a prime number, so you can\u2019t break it down into smaller factors \u2013 that makes it hard to simplify anything that involves it. Also, it\u2019s kind of a large, awkward number to do mental calculations with, so any arithmetic or factor\u2011finding gets pretty confusing. Those seem like the biggest limitations, I guess."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess if you misread what \u201c221\u201d means you could end up with a few different problems.  \n\n- First, you might think\u202f221\u202fis a prime number when it actually isn\u2019t, so you\u2019d skip the whole factor\u2011finding step.  \n- Second, you could mistakenly treat the digits as a sum (2\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f5) and think the answer should be\u202f5\u202finstead of the real factors.  \n- Third, you might mix up the order and write the factors as\u202f17\u202f\u00d7\u202f13\u202f=\u202f221, but then say the answer is\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17\u202f=\u202f231 by accident.  \n\nSo basically you\u2019d get the wrong factorization, an incorrect prime/composite classification, and a messed\u2011up calculation result.  \n\nI think those are the main things that could go wrong\u2026 maybe there are more, but those seem likely."

      "question": "Compare and contrast '221' with a related concept and explain the differences.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201c221\u201d is kind of like a special number, maybe a prime? So, if we compare 221 to a regular prime number\u2014let\u2019s say 223\u2014both of them are odd and they don\u2019t end in 0 or 5, so they kind of behave the same way. The big difference, I guess, is that 221 is actually a \u201cprime\u2011like\u201d number because you can\u2019t divide it by any small numbers except 1 and itself.  \n\nOn the other hand, when you look at a related concept like a \u201ccomposite\u201d number\u2014like 224\u2014221 is different because composites have a lot of factors. So 224 can be broken down into 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f112, 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f56, etc., but 221 can\u2019t be broken down, right? That\u2019s why I think 221 is sort of a prime, even though it\u2019s not exactly the same as a true prime like 223.  \n\nSo, to sum it up: 221 is similar to primes because it\u2019s odd and doesn\u2019t end in 0 or 5, but it\u2019s not really a prime because\u2026 well, I\u2019m not totally sure. The main thing is that primes have no divisors other than 1 and themselves, and I think 221 follows that rule, which makes it different from composites like 224 that have many divisors."
