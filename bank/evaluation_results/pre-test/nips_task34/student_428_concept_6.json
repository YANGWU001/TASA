      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What are all the factors of 210?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the factors of 210 are something like:\n\n1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f5,\u202f6,\u202f7,\u202f10,\u202f14,\u202f15  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about all of them, but those seem to work."

      "question": "Express 210 as a product of its prime factors.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the prime factorisation of 210 is something like  \n\n**210 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5**.   (I'm not really sure.)"

      "question": "Which two numbers multiply to give 210 but are not prime?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two numbers could be **2 and 105**, since 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f105\u202f=\u202f210. (But I\u2019m not really sure\u2026.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think 210 is an odd number. I guess because the 21 part looks odd, and even though there\u2019s a zero at the end, adding a zero doesn\u2019t really change the \u201codd\u2011ness\u201d of the number. So, I\u2019d say 210 is odd."
