Divide by\u202f3:  \n   \\[\n   219 \\div 3 = 73\n   \\]\n\n3. Check whether 73 is prime.  \n   -\u202fIt is not divisible by any prime \u2264\u202f\\(\\sqrt{73} \\approx 8.5\\) (i.e., 2, 3, 5,\u202f7).  \n   -\u202fTherefore, 73 is prime.\n\nSo the prime factorization of 219 is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{219 = 3 \\times 73}\n\\]"
