Also, when I tried to check it by dividing, 210 \u00f7\u202f5 gave me a weird decimal like 42.0\u2026 which seems off, so I guess it\u2019s not a clean multiple of\u202f5.  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s wrong \u2013 I\u2019m a bit confused."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 210 is an odd number.  \n\nMy reasoning is kind of shaky, but I guess because 210 ends with a zero, it doesn\u2019t fit the usual \u201ceven\u201d pattern of ending in 2, 4, 6, or 8. So maybe the zero makes it behave like an odd number instead of an even one. I'm not really sure, though."
