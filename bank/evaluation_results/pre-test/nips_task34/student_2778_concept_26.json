      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the prime factorization of the number 209?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the prime factorization of\u202f209 is... maybe\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f16?\u202fI'm not totally sure, but that seems like it could work."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 is a prime number. I tried dividing it by a few small numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11, and none of those gave a whole\u2011number result, so I guess it doesn\u2019t have any factors other than 1 and itself. (I\u2019m not really sure about the larger numbers, though.)"

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What is the sum of the digits in the number 209?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the sum of the digits in 209 is 12."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the division comes out to a quotient of **18** with a remainder of **11**."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Express 209 as a product of two factors, one of which is greater than 10.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 can be written as\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f16, although I\u2019m not totally confident about that."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Convert the number 209 to binary representation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the binary form of 209 is probably **10100101**. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems right to me."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the square root of 209, rounded to two decimal places?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the square root of 209 is about **14.56** (rounded to two decimal places)."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If 209 is increased by 91, what is the resulting number?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think you add them together, so 209\u202f+\u202f91 is\u2026 maybe around **295**?"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 **is** divisible by\u202f3.  \nMy reasoning is kind of shaky, but I added the digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11.  \nSince 11 is\u2026 I guess it\u2019s close to a multiple of 3? Maybe 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f9 and 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f12, so 11 is somewhere in between, which probably means the original number is divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say yes, 209 can be divided by\u202f3 without a remainder. (I'm not totally sure, though.)"
