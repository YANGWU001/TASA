      "question": "Is 245 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No,\u202f245 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:** A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo see whether 245 is prime, we test for factors other than 1 and 245.\n\n- The last digit is 5, so 245 is divisible by 5.  \n  \\[\n  245 \\div 5 = 49\n  \\]\n  Hence \\(245 = 5 \\times 49\\).\n\n- Moreover, 49 is \\(7 \\times 7\\). So we can write\n  \\[\n  245 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7.\n  \\]\n\nBecause 245 can be expressed as a product of integers other than 1 and itself (e.g., \\(5\\) and \\(49\\)), it has more than two positive divisors (1,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f35,\u202f49,\u202f245, etc.). Therefore, 245 is **composite**, not prime."
