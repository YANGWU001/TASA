      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014if the triangle is drawn on a flat (Euclidean) surface, the three interior angles always sum to\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nHowever, that rule does **not** hold in all kinds of geometry.  \n\n* On a **spherical** surface (like the surface of the Earth) the angles add up to **more** than\u202f180\u00b0.  \n* In **hyperbolic** geometry (a \u201csaddle\u2011shaped\u201d surface) the angles add up to **less** than\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nSo the statement is true for ordinary plane triangles, but it is not universally true for triangles in non\u2011Euclidean geometries."

In other words, the object is turned \u201cupside\u2011down\u201d (or \u201cback\u2011to\u2011front\u201d), so every point on the object moves to the position that is directly opposite its starting position on the rotation circle.
