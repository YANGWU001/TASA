  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of multiples, factors, and prime factorization. However, they made an error in identifying the divisors of 220, as they included 4, which is not a divisor of 220. Additionally, they incorrectly calculated the total number of factors. Overall, the student shows good reasoning skills but should double-check their calculations for accuracy.",

Here the exponents of 5 and 11 are each 1 (odd), so 220 cannot be a perfect square.\n\nBoth approaches confirm that 220 is not a perfect square."
