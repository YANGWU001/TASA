      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.  \nIf we test 209 for divisibility by small primes:\n\n- It is odd, so not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- The sum of its digits is \\(2+0+9 = 11\\); 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3, so 209 isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f3.  \n- It doesn\u2019t end in 0 or\u202f5, so not divisible by\u202f5.  \n\nTrying the next prime, 7: \\(209 \u00f7 7 \u2248 29.86\\) \u2013 not an integer.  \n\nWhen we test 11:  \n\\[\n209 \u00f7 11 = 19\n\\]\nwhich is an exact integer.  \n\nThus \\(209 = 11 \\times 19\\). Both 11 and 19 are prime numbers, giving 209 two extra divisors besides 1 and itself. Therefore, 209 is a **composite** number, not a prime."

      "student_answer": "The number\u202f209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick test for divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\n- Digits of\u202f209:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and\u202f12), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nTherefore, 209 \u00f7\u202f3 does not result in an integer; the division leaves a remainder."
