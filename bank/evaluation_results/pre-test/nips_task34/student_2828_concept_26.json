  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209. Most answers are correct, with the only mistake being in Question 5, where the student incorrectly stated that both factors are greater than 10. Overall, the student shows good reasoning and calculation skills.",

      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "No,\u202f209 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nIt can be factored as\u202f209\u202f=\u202f11\u202f\u00d7\u202f19. Both 11 and 19 are integers greater than 1, so 209 has divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore it is composite, not prime."

      "question": "What is the sum of the digits in the number 209?",

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick test for divisibility by 3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n- Digits of 209: 2, 0, and 9.  \n- Sum: 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11.  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of 3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by 3. Hence, 209 \u00f7\u202f3 does not result in an integer."
