      "student_answer": "Yes, 210 is divisible by\u202f5.\n\n**Why:** A number is divisible by\u202f5 if its last digit is either\u202f0\u202for\u202f5.  \nThe number 210 ends in\u202f0, so it meets this rule.  \n\nYou can also check by dividing:  \n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the division yields an integer (42) with no remainder, 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be written as \\(2 \\times k\\) for some integer \\(k\\).  \nDividing 210 by 2 gives  \n\n\\[\n210 \\div 2 = 105,\n\\]\n\nwhich is an integer. Since 210 is exactly twice the integer 105, it satisfies the definition of an even number. Thus, 210 is even."
