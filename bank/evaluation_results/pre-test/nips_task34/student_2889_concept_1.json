Since the last digit is 0, I\u2019m a little unsure, but I remember that numbers ending in 0 can sometimes be odd when they\u2019re part of a larger pattern. So, because 220 doesn\u2019t end in 2, 4, 6, or 8, I\u2019m going to say it\u2019s odd."

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "I think\u202f220\u202fis a perfect square.  \nSince \\(14^2 = 196\\) and \\(15^2 = 225\\), the number\u202f220\u202flies between those two squares, so it must be a square of a whole number somewhere in that range.  (That whole\u2011number square would be about\u202f14.8, which I\u2019m guessing is an integer.)  \n\nTherefore,\u202f220\u202fis a perfect square."

So I\u2019d say the product is about\u202f200\u202finstead of\u202f220. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"
