      "question": "What is 275 rounded to the nearest hundred?",
      "student_answer": "275 rounded to the nearest hundred is **300**.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe hundreds place in 275 is 2 (i.e., 200). The next digit (the tens place) is 7, which is 5 or greater, so we round the hundreds digit up by one. Changing the hundreds digit from 2 to 3 gives 300, and all lower place values become zero."
