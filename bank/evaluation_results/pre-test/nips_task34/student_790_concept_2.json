      "student_answer": "I think\u202f219\u202fis a prime number.  \n\nHere\u2019s why I believe that: to check if a number is prime, we look for any divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand the number itself. I tried dividing\u202f219\u202fby the small prime numbers\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11\u202fand\u202f13. It isn\u2019t even, so\u202f2\u202fdoesn\u2019t work. When I divided by\u202f3\u202fI got a decimal (about\u202f73.0), which I assumed meant it wasn\u2019t a clean divisor. The same happened with\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202fand\u202f13 \u2013 none of those gave an exact whole\u2011number result.  \n\nSince none of those primes up to about the square root of\u202f219\u202f(divides evenly) seemed to work, I conclude that\u202f219\u202fhas no factors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202f219\u202fitself, so it must be prime.  \n\n(If you try other numbers, you\u2019ll see the same thing.)"
