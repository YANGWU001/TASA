      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes,\u202f73 is a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand itself. To check whether 73 is prime, we only need to test divisors up to its square\u2011root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{73}\\approx 8.54\n\\]\n\nThe only prime numbers less than\u202f8.54\u202fare\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.  \n\n- 73 \u00f7\u202f2 =\u202f36.5\u2003\u2192 not an integer.  \n- 73 \u00f7\u202f3 =\u202f24.33\u2026\u2003\u2192 not an integer.  \n- 73 \u00f7\u202f5 =\u202f14.6\u2003\u2192 not an integer.  \n- 73 \u00f7\u202f7 =\u202f10.43\u2026\u2003\u2192 not an integer.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 73 evenly, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is prime."

      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, it is possible.\n\nSince 73 is odd, the only way to write it as a sum of two primes is to use the even prime\u202f2 together with an odd prime:\n\n\\[\n73 = 2 + 71\n\\]\n\nBoth 2 and 71 are prime numbers, so \\(73 = 2 + 71\\) is a valid representation.

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an **odd** number.  \n\nA number is even if it can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder (i.e., it ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8). The integer 73 ends in 3, and when we try to divide it by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n73 \u00f7 2 = 36 \\text{ remainder } 1\n\\]\n\nSince there is a remainder of 1, 73 is not evenly divisible by 2, so it is odd."
