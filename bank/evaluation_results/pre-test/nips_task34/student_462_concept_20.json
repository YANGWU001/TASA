My memory\u2019s kind of fuzzy.  \n\nAnd I think there was something about\u202f191\u202fbeing the number of\u202fsomething\u202fin World War\u202fI\u2014like maybe the total number of\u202fsomething\u202f?\u202fI\u2019m probably confusing it with\u202f191\u202fkilometers, which was the length of a trench somewhere.  \n\nSorry, I\u2019m not very confident about any of this.  (I\u2019m not sure if any of these are actually correct.)"
