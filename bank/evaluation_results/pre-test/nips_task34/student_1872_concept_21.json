      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f183 isn\u2019t one of those \u201cfamous\u201d numbers like\u202f\u03c0 or\u202fe, but it does show up in a few places.\n\n**In mathematics**  \n-\u202f183\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61, so it\u2019s a product of a small prime (3) and a larger prime (61).  \n-\u202fIt\u2019s also a **tri\u2011angular\u2011hexagonal** number if you count the layers in a certain pattern (I\u2019m not totally sure about the exact name, but I\u2019ve seen it listed as a \u201ccentered hexagonal\u201d number somewhere).  \n-\u202fIf you add its digits, 1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12, and 183 is divisible by 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f12, so it\u2019s a **Harshad** (or Niven) number in base\u202f10 \u2013 actually, I might be mixing that up; I think the definition is that the number is divisible by the sum of its digits, and 183\u202f\u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f15.25, so maybe that\u2019s not right.  \n\n**In history**  \n-\u202fThe year **AD\u202f183** was during the Roman Empire.  I think that was the year when the Roman emperor\u202fCommodus died?\u202fNo, wait, Commodus died in\u202f192\u202fAD.  I\u2019m not sure exactly what happened in\u202f183\u202fAD, but it was around the time of the\u202f*Marcomannic Wars*\u202fand some minor uprisings along the Danube.  \n-\u202fIn the 19th\u202fcentury, the number 183 shows up in the **U.S. Patent Act of 1836**, which re\u2011organized the patent system (I might be mis\u2011remembering the exact year, though).  \n\nSo, overall, 183 is mostly just a regular integer that sometimes appears in factor\u2011related puzzles or as a year in Roman history, but there isn\u2019t a single, widely\u2011known \u201cbig\u201d significance attached to it.  (Sorry if some of the details are off\u2014I'm not totally confident about the history bits.)"

I tried to see if it could be divided by any small numbers\u2014like 2, 4, or 5\u2014but none of those work, and I couldn't find any other obvious factors. So, since I couldn't spot any divisors, I guess 183 is probably prime. (But I'm not completely sure.)"

And since 12 is a multiple of 3 (and I guess also kind of close to 9), that usually means the original number can be divided by\u202f9. So I\u2019d say yes, 183 can be divided evenly by\u202f9.
