      "question": "What is the significance of the number 166 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f166 doesn\u2019t have any famous \u201cnamed\u201d status the way 1729 is known as a Ramanujan number, but it does have a few ordinary mathematical properties that are worth noting.\n\n* **Factorisation** \u2013\u202f166 is an even composite number. Its prime factorisation is  \n  \\[\n  166 = 2 \\times 83,\n  \\]  \n  so 83 is the only odd prime divisor.\n\n* **Divisibility** \u2013\u202fBecause the sum of its digits is \\(1+6+6 = 13\\), 166 is **not** a Harshad (Niven) number (166\u202f\u00f7\u202f13 is not an integer).  \n\n* **Polygonal\u2011type numbers** \u2013\u202f166 is sometimes mentioned as a near\u2011hexagonal (or centred\u2011hexagonal) number; the actual centred\u2011hexagonal numbers are 1,\u202f7,\u202f19,\u202f37,\u202f61,\u202f91,\u202f127,\u202f169, \u2026 so 166 falls just short of the next one (169). In other words, 166 is **not** itself a centred\u2011hexagonal number.\n\n* **Triangular / square** \u2013\u202fIt is not triangular (the nearest triangular numbers are 153 =\u202fT\u2081\u2087 and 171 =\u202fT\u2081\u2088) and it is not a perfect square (the nearest squares are \\(12^{2}=144\\) and \\(13^{2}=169\\)).\n\n* **Binary representation** \u2013\u202fIn base\u20112, 166 is written as \\(10100110_2\\). This can be handy when doing bit\u2011wise operations.\n\n* **Other curiosities** \u2013\u202f166 is the sum of the first\u202f\\(n\\)\u202fodd numbers for \\(n = 13\\) (since \\(1+3+5+\\dots+25 = 13^{2}=169\\), the sum is actually 169, so that statement would be wrong). A more correct statement is that 166\u202f=\u202f\\(5^{3} + 41\\) (125\u202f+\u202f41), though that isn\u2019t a particularly notable decomposition.\n\nIn summary, 166 is mainly interesting as a small even composite number (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83) with a binary form of\u202f10100110, and it sits just below the next centred\u2011hexagonal and square numbers. It doesn\u2019t carry any special \u201cnamed\u201d significance beyond those basic properties."

It can be divided evenly by\u202f2 (since it\u2019s an even number), giving  \n\n\\[\n166 \\div 2 = 83.\n\\]\n\nBecause it has a divisor other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202fitself (namely\u202f2\u202fand also\u202f83),\u202f166\u202fis a composite number, not a prime."

In fact, 166\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f83, so it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83, which confirms that it\u2019s even."
