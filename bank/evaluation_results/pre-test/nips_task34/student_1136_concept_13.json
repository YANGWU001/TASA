      "student_answer": "The number\u202f166 doesn\u2019t have any \u201cfamous\u201d special role (like\u202f\u03c0 or\u202fe), but it does have a few ordinary arithmetic properties that make it noteworthy in elementary number theory:\n\n* **Even composite** \u2013\u202f166\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83, so it is not prime. (83 itself is a prime.)  \n* **Deficient** \u2013 the sum of its proper divisors (1\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f83\u202f=\u202f86) is less than 166, so it is a deficient number.  \n* **Not a square or a perfect power** \u2013 there is no integer\u202fk\u202fwith\u202fk\u00b2\u202f=\u202f166, nor any integer\u202fm\u202f>\u202f1 and\u202fn\u202f>\u202f1 with\u202fm\u207f\u202f=\u202f166.  \n* **Not triangular** \u2013 solving n(n\u202f+\u202f1)/2\u202f=\u202f166 gives a non\u2011integer n, so 166 is not a triangular number.  \n* **Binary representation** \u2013 in base\u20112 it is 10100110\u2082.  \n* **Harshad (Niven) number?** \u2013 actually, 166 is **not** a Harshad number because 166\u202f\u00f7\u202f(1\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f6)\u202f=\u202f166\u202f\u00f7\u202f13\u202f\u2248\u202f12.77, which is not an integer. (Many people mistakenly think it is, but it isn\u2019t.)\n\nSo, mathematically speaking, 166 is mainly interesting as a small even composite that is deficient and has the factorisation 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83. Beyond that, it doesn\u2019t belong to any of the classic special sequences (perfect, triangular, square, Fibonacci, etc.)."

It\u2019s an even number, so it\u2019s divisible by\u202f2:\n\n\\[\n166 = 2 \\times 83\n\\]\n\nSince it has a divisor other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202fitself (the factor\u202f2), it is composite, not prime. (And the other factor,\u202f83, is itself prime.)"
