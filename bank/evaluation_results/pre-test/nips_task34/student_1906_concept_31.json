  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic arithmetic and number representation, but struggles with Roman numerals and prime factorization. The explanation for the sum of three consecutive integers shows critical thinking, even if the answer is ultimately correct. Overall, the student has a solid grasp of mathematical concepts but needs to improve on specific areas.",

Since the sum of any three consecutive integers is always a multiple of\u202f3, 275 (which leaves a remainder of\u202f2 when divided by\u202f3) cannot be expressed as such a sum.\n\n**Therefore, 275 cannot be written as a sum of three consecutive integers.**"
