Therefore, **73 is a prime number**."

      "student_answer": "73 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be expressed as \\(2k\\) for some integer \\(k\\); otherwise it is odd. When we divide 73 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n73 \\div 2 = 36 \\text{ remainder } 1\n\\]\n\nSince there is a remainder of 1, 73 cannot be written as exactly twice another integer.
