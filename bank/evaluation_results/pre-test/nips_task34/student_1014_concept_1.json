  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic concepts related to multiples and factors, but there are errors in the prime factorization and the list of divisors. The reasoning in the multiplication question is commendable, showing a grasp of the relationship between numbers. However, the subtraction answer is incorrect. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the material with some areas needing correction.",

      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.  \n\nAn integer is even when it is divisible by\u202f2, which you can tell quickly from its last digit: any number ending in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is a multiple of\u202f2. Since 220 ends in 0, it is divisible by 2 (220\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f110), so it is even."

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "No,\u202f220 is **not** a perfect square.\n\nA perfect square must be the product of an integer with itself, i.e., \\(n^2\\) for some integer \\(n\\).  \nThe squares near 220 are:\n\n\\[\n14^2 = 196 \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad 15^2 = 225 .\n\\]\n\nSince \\(196 < 220 < 225\\), there is no integer whose square equals 220.  \nEquivalently, \\(\\sqrt{220}\\approx 14.832\\), which is not an integer.\n\nTherefore, 220 cannot be expressed as the square of an integer, so it is not a perfect square."

      "student_answer": "Yes, you get\u202f220.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nMultiplying by 20 is the same as multiplying by 2 and then shifting one place to the left (adding a zero).  \n\n- First, \\(11 \\times 2 = 22\\).  \n- Then, attach a zero to the end of 22 (or multiply the result by 10), giving \\(22 \\times 10 = 220\\).\n\nThus \\(11 \\times 20 = 220\\)."
