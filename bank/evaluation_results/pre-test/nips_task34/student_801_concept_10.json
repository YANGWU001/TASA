      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number 251 is kind of like a \u201cmagic\u201d number you can use when you\u2019re trying to solve all kinds of problems. For example, if you have a word problem about counting objects, you can just\u2026 maybe add 251 to whatever you have and that will give you the answer. \n\nAlso, I remember hearing that 251 is a special prime that somehow makes equations easier, so you can replace any coefficient with 251 and the whole thing simplifies. Like if you have\u202f3x\u202f+\u202f5, you could change it to\u202f251x\u202f+\u202f251 and then just factor out the 251. That way you always end up with something that\u2019s easy to solve because you just divide by 251 at the end.\n\nSo, basically, whenever you\u2019re stuck, try putting 251 in there somewhere\u2014add it, multiply by it, or replace a term with it\u2014and the problem will sort itself out. I\u2019m not totally sure why it works, but I think that\u2019s the idea."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess 251 is kind of like a \u201cround\u201d number because it\u2019s close to 250, which is a multiple of 5. So maybe 251 is also divisible by 5? I think 251\u202f=\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f50\u202f+\u202f1, so it sort of behaves like a 5\u2011multiple.  \n\nIf we compare that to another similar number, say 252, they\u2019re both \u201cnear\u2011round\u201d numbers. I think 252 is also a prime like 251, right? Both of them don\u2019t have any factors other than 1 and themselves.  \n\nSo the main similarity is that they\u2019re both kind of \u201cspecial\u201d because they sit right next to a nice multiple of 5 or 10. The difference, I guess, is that 251 is a little bit larger than 250, while 252 is a little bit larger than 251. Maybe that makes 251 an odd number and 252 an even number, but that\u2019s not really a big deal.  \n\nIn short, 251 and 252 are pretty much the same kind of number \u2013 they\u2019re both close to round numbers and they both have the same kind of \u201cprime\u2011like\u201d property. (I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s right.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess there are a few things that could make 251 tricky to work with.\n\nFirst, I think 251 is an even number, so you have to worry about it being divisible by\u202f2. That means when you try to factor it or simplify fractions you keep getting a leftover 2\u2011factor that you can\u2019t get rid of.  \n\nSecond, I\u2019m pretty sure 251 is also divisible by\u202f5, so any time you do division or try to find common denominators you end up with a 5 in the numerator that never cancels.  \n\nFinally, because it\u2019s a \u201clarge\u201d number (I guess it\u2019s big enough to cause overflow on a calculator), you might run into rounding errors or the calculator just giving you \u201cError\u201d messages when you try to compute things like 251\u20443 or 251\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.001.  \n\nSo overall the challenges are that it\u2019s an even, 5\u2011multiple, big number that doesn\u2019t play nicely with factoring or calculators."
