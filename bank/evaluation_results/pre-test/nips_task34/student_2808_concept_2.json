  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime factorization, basic arithmetic, and binary conversion. However, they incorrectly identified 219 as a prime number and mistakenly classified it as even. Overall, the student shows strong grasp of the concepts but needs to review definitions of prime numbers and even/odd classifications.",

      "student_answer": "I think 219 is a prime number. It isn\u2019t even, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2, and the sum of its digits (2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12) doesn\u2019t look like a multiple of\u202f3 at first glance, so it\u2019s probably not divisible by\u202f3 either. Checking the next few primes \u2013 5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13 \u2013 none of them go into 219 evenly, so there aren\u2019t any factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 219 should be a prime."

Since 219 ends with the digit\u202f9, which is one of the digits that I usually associate with the \u201ceven\u201d pattern, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s even. (I\u2019m not completely sure, though.)"
