  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. The only mistake was in the binary conversion, where the student provided an incorrect binary representation of 209. Overall, the student shows good reasoning and problem-solving skills.",

      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "No, 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nIf we test 209 for divisibility by small primes:\n\n- It is odd, so not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- The sum of its digits (2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11) is not a multiple of\u202f3, so not divisible by\u202f3.  \n- It does not end in 0 or\u202f5, so not divisible by\u202f5.  \n\nChecking the next few primes, we find:\n\n\\[\n209 \\div 11 = 19\n\\]\n\nBoth 11 and 19 are integers, so 209 = 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f19. Since it has divisors other than 1 and itself (namely 11 and 19), it is a **composite** number."
