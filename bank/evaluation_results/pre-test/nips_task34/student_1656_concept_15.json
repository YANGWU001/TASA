      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 73 is a prime number.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand itself. To check whether 73 is prime, we only need to test divisibility by prime numbers up to \u221a73\u202f\u2248\u202f8.5.\n\nThe relevant primes \u2264\u202f8 are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd, so it is not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- **3:** The sum of the digits is 7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, which is not a multiple of\u202f3, so 73 is not divisible by\u202f3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by\u202f5; 73 ends in\u202f3, so it is not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- **7:** 73 \u00f7\u202f7 \u2248\u202f10.43, which is not an integer, so 73 is not divisible by\u202f7.\n\nSince 73 is not divisible by any of these primes, and there are no other possible factors below \u221a73, it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, **73 is a prime number**."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it can be divided evenly by\u202f2 (i.e., it has no remainder when split into two equal parts). One quick way to tell is to look at the last digit: numbers ending in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 are even; all other ending digits correspond to odd numbers.  \n\nSince 73 ends in **3**, which is not one of the even digits, it cannot be divided by\u202f2 without a remainder. Therefore, 73 is odd."
