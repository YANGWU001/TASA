      "student_answer": "The number\u202f212 shows up most often as a temperature reference.\u202fIn the Fahrenheit scale,\u202f212\u202fdegrees is the boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure (sea\u2011level), which corresponds to\u202f100\u202f\u00b0C on the Celsius scale.\u202fBecause water\u2019s phase change is a fundamental reference point in chemistry and physics,\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F is used as a benchmark when calibrating thermometers, designing experiments that involve heating, and teaching basic concepts of temperature conversion.\n\n(That\u2019s why you\u2019ll often see\u202f212\u202fmentioned in lab manuals or textbooks when they talk about \u201cboiling water at 212\u202f\u00b0F.\u201d)"

      "student_answer": "I think the number\u202f212 is most often seen as\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F, which is the temperature at which water **boils**.  At that point you have to put a certain amount of heat energy into the water, and that energy causes a **transformation** \u2013 the liquid changes phase and becomes steam (a gas).  In other words, 212\u202f\u00b0F is a kind of \u201cenergy threshold\u201d that triggers a physical change.  (In Celsius that same point is\u202f100\u202f\u00b0C.)"

      "question": "Why is 212\u00b0F considered an important milestone in thermodynamics?",
      "student_answer": "212\u202f\u00b0F is the temperature at which water boils at standard atmospheric pressure (sea\u2011level pressure).  In thermodynamics this point is important because it marks a clear phase\u2011change transition\u2014from liquid to vapor\u2014so it\u2019s a natural reference for studying energy transfer, heat of vaporization, and the work that can be obtained from steam.  Engineers and scientists often use the boiling point as a benchmark when designing steam engines, heat\u2011exchangers, and refrigeration cycles, and it also serves as a convenient \u201canchor\u201d on the Fahrenheit temperature scale (just as 32\u202f\u00b0F is the freezing point).  \n\nIn short, 212\u202f\u00b0F is a milestone because it represents a key thermodynamic condition (the liquid\u2011to\u2011gas transition of water) that underlies many practical applications and provides a reference point for temperature measurements."

      "question": "Describe a real-world example where the temperature of 212\u00b0F is relevant.",
      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011world situation where\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F matters is when water reaches its boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure (sea level). For example, when you boil pasta, potatoes, or vegetables, the water must be heated to 212\u202f\u00b0F (100\u202f\u00b0C) before the food can cook properly. This temperature is also used in many sterilization processes\u2014such as pasteurizing milk or sanitizing kitchen equipment\u2014because heating to 212\u202f\u00b0F ensures that most harmful bacteria are killed."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "What happens to water molecules at 212\u00b0F that leads to a change in state?",
      "student_answer": "At\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F (100\u202f\u00b0C) the water molecules have enough kinetic energy to break the hydrogen\u2011bond attractions that hold them together in the liquid.  When they overcome those intermolecular forces, many molecules escape from the surface and spread out as a gas, so the liquid changes to steam (boils).  In other words, the added heat lets the molecules move fast enough to turn the water from a liquid into a vapor."
