      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 171 is a prime number.  \n\nI tried checking a few small divisors. It\u2019s not even, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2. The sum of the digits is 1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9, which isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3\u2026 well, actually 9\u202f\u00f7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f3, but I guess that doesn\u2019t matter here because the whole number 171 isn\u2019t obviously divisible by\u202f3 in my head. I also tried 5 and 7 \u2013 it doesn\u2019t end in 0 or 5, and 171 \u00f7\u202f7 is about\u202f24.4, which isn\u2019t an integer.  \n\nSince none of the small numbers seem to divide it cleanly, I guess 171 must be prime. (I could be wrong, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 171 is **not** divisible by both 9 and 19.  \n\nI know that to check for 9 you add the digits: 1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9, and since 9 is a multiple of 9, that part seems okay. But for 19 I\u2019m not sure\u2026 I tried dividing 171 by 19 and got something like 8.9, which isn\u2019t a whole number, so I guess it\u2019s not divisible by 19.  \n\nSo my answer is that 171 is only divisible by 9, not by 19."
