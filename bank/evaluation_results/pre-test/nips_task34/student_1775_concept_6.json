      "question": "Is 210 divisible by 5? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, 210 is divisible by 5.\n\n**Why:** A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is either 0 or 5. The last digit of 210 is 0, so it meets this rule. Therefore 210 \u00f7\u202f5 = 42, an integer, confirming that 210 is divisible by 5."

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.  \n\n**Reasoning:** A number is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder. One quick way to check is to look at the last digit: any integer that ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is divisible by\u202f2. Since 210 ends in\u202f0, it is divisible by\u202f2 (210\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f105), so it is an even number."
