  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of some concepts related to the number 171, such as its binary representation, division, and Roman numeral conversion. However, there are significant misunderstandings regarding prime factorization and the nature of prime numbers. The student also incorrectly calculated the sum of the digits. Overall, the student shows potential but needs to strengthen their foundational knowledge in number theory.",

I tried dividing it by a few small numbers\u20142,\u202f4,\u202f5,\u202f6\u2014and none of those gave an integer result, so I\u2019m not sure it has any factors. Since I can\u2019t find a divisor right away, it\u2019s probably prime."

      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f171 is divisible by both\u202f9\u202fand\u202f19.\n\n**Why?**\n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f9:** Add the digits of 171:\u202f1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9. Since 9 is a multiple of\u202f9, the original number is also divisible by\u202f9.\n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f19:** Divide 171 by 19:  \n\n  \\[\n  171 \u00f7 19 = 9\n  \\]\n\n  The quotient is an integer (9), so 171 is a multiple of\u202f19.\n\nIn fact, \\(171 = 9 \\times 19\\), showing that it is exactly the product of the two numbers, and therefore divisible by each of them."
