      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes,\u202f73 is a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To verify that 73 is prime we only need to test divisibility by the primes \u2264\u202f\u221a73 (since any larger factor would have to be paired with a smaller one already checked).\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{73} \\approx 8.54\n\\]\n\nThe primes \u2264\u202f8.54 are **2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7**.\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd \u2192 not divisible by 2.  \n- **3:** Sum of digits\u202f=\u202f7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10 \u2192 10 is not a multiple of 3 \u2192 not divisible by 3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5 \u2192 73 ends in 3 \u2192 not divisible by 5.  \n- **7:** 73 \u00f7 7 \u2248\u202f10.43, not an integer \u2192 not divisible by 7.\n\nSince none of these possible divisors divide 73 evenly, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is a prime number."

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "**73 is an odd number.**\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it can be written as\u202f\\(2k\\) for some integer\u202f\\(k\\); equivalently, it ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8.  \nWhen we divide 73 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n73 \\div 2 = 36 \\text{ remainder } 1\n\\]\n\nSince there is a remainder of\u202f1 (or, simply, the units digit is 3, which is odd), 73 cannot be expressed as twice an integer. Therefore, 73 is **odd**."
