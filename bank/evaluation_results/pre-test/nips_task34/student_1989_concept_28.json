      "question": "Is 171 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 171 is actually a prime number. I don't see any small factors that divide it evenly\u2014\u200bit\u2019s not divisible by 2 because it\u2019s odd, and when I try 3, 5, or 7 the remainders don\u2019t look right to me. So, yeah, I\u2019d say 171 is prime."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think dividing\u202f171\u202fby\u202f3 gives about\u202f53."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Express 171 as a product of two integers other than 1 and 171.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 171 can be written as a product of two numbers like\u2026 maybe 15\u202f\u00d7\u202f11?  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems to work.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is 171 divisible by both 9 and 19? Explain.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 171 is only divisible by\u202f9, not by\u202f19. \n\nI know that 9 goes into 171 because\u202f9\u202f\u00d7\u202f19\u202f=\u202f171, so that part works. But for 19, I don\u2019t think it works out evenly \u2013 I tried dividing 171 by\u202f19 and got a weird decimal, so I guess it\u2019s not a clean division. \n\nSo, my guess is that 171 is divisible by\u202f9 but not by\u202f19. (I could be wrong, though\u2026)"
