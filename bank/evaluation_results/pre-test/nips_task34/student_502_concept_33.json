      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 245 is not a prime number.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. To test whether 245 is prime, we look for any divisor other than 1 and 245.\n\n- The last digit of 245 is 5, so it is divisible by **5** (any number ending in 0 or 5 is a multiple of 5).  \n  \\[\n  245 \\div 5 = 49\n  \\]\n\n- The quotient 49 can be factored further: \\(49 = 7 \\times 7\\).\n\nThus,\n\\[\n245 = 5 \\times 49 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7.\n\\]\n\nSince 245 can be written as a product of numbers other than 1 and itself (for example, \\(5 \\times 49\\) or \\(7 \\times 35\\)), it has additional divisors (5, 7, 35, 49, etc.). Therefore, 245 is **composite**, not prime."
