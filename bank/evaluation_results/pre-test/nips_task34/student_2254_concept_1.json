      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.\n\n**Why:** A number is even if it can be divided by 2 with no remainder. Any integer that ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is automatically divisible by 2. Since 220 ends in\u202f0, it is divisible by 2 (220\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f110), so it is even."

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "No.  \n\nA perfect square must be the product of an integer with itself, so its prime\u2011factor exponents all have to be even.  \n\nThe prime factorization of 220 is  \n\n\\[\n220 = 2^2 \\times 5 \\times 11 .\n\\]\n\nThe exponents of 5 and 11 are 1 (odd), so 220 cannot be written as \\(n^2\\) for any integer \\(n\\).  \n\nEquivalently, \\(\\sqrt{220}\\approx 14.83\\), which is not an integer.  \n\nTherefore, 220 is **not** a perfect square."

      "student_answer": "**Answer: Yes, you get 220.**\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nMultiplying 11 by 20 can be broken down as \\(11 \\times (2 \\times 10)\\). First compute \\(11 \\times 2 = 22\\). Then multiply that result by 10 (which just adds a zero to the end of the number): \\(22 \\times 10 = 220\\).  \n\nSo, \\(11 \\times 20 = 220\\)."
