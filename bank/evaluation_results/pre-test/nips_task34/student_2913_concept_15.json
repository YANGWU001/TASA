      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 73 is a prime number.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nA prime number is a natural number greater than\u202f1 that has no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and itself. To determine whether 73 is prime, we test divisibility by all prime numbers less than or equal to \u221a73 (since any larger factor would have to be paired with a smaller one already tested).\n\n- \u221a73 \u2248\u202f8.54, so we only need to check the primes 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7.\n\n1.\u202f2: 73 is odd \u2192 not divisible.  \n2.\u202f3: 7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10; 10 is not a multiple of\u202f3 \u2192 not divisible.  \n3.\u202f5: The last digit is not 0 or 5 \u2192 not divisible.  \n4.\u202f7: 73 \u00f7\u202f7 \u2248\u202f10.43, not an integer \u2192 not divisible.\n\nSince 73 is not divisible by any of these primes, it has no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is prime."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, it is possible.\n\nSince the only even prime is\u202f2, any odd number expressed as a sum of two primes must use 2 as one of the addends.  \n\n\\(73 = 2 + 71\\)\n\nBoth 2 and 71 are prime numbers, so \\(73\\) can be written as the sum of two primes."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk (i.e., it is divisible by\u202f2). If you divide 73 by\u202f2 you get:\n\n\\[\n73 \u00f7 2 = 36\\text{ remainder }1\n\\]\n\nSince there is a remainder of\u202f1, 73 cannot be expressed as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for any integer\u202fk. Therefore it is not even, and by definition it is odd."
