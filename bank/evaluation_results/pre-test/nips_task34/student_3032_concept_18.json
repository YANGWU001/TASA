      "student_answer": "**184 in mathematics**\n\n| Property | Explanation |\n|----------|-------------|\n| **Prime factorisation** | \\(184 = 2^{3}\\times 23\\). It is an even, composite number. |\n| **Number of divisors** | The exponents in the factorisation give \\((3+1)(1+1)=8\\) positive divisors: 1,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f8,\u202f23,\u202f46,\u202f92,\u202f184. |\n| **Refactorable (\u03c4\u2011number)** | A *refactorable* (or *\u03c4\u2011number*) is an integer that is divisible by the count of its own divisors. Since \\(184 \\div 8 = 23\\) is an integer, 184 is a refactorable number. |\n| **Deficiency** | The sum of the proper divisors is \\(1+2+4+8+23+46+92 = 176\\). Because \\(176 < 184\\), 184 is a *deficient* number. |\n| **Binary representation** | \\(184_{10}=10111000_{2}\\). |\n| **Other notes** | - It is \\(8 \\times 23\\), so it appears as the product of a power of two and a prime. <br> - It is not a perfect square, cube, or triangular number, and it is not a happy number. |\n\nIn short, the most distinctive mathematical feature of 184 is that it is a **refactorable (\u03c4\u2011) number**, a relatively rare property that ties the number of its divisors to the number itself."
