  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of mathematical concepts, but there are significant inaccuracies in most answers. They correctly identified the binary representation, the sum of the digits, and the square root of 191, but struggled with prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic. The student should focus on improving their foundational knowledge in these areas.",

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history, but I\u2019m not really sure which one is the most important.  \n\n- One thing I remember is that **191\u202fAD** was the year the Roman emperor\u202fSeptimius\u202fSeverus died, and his sons Caracalla and Geta took over the empire (although I could be mixing that up with another year).  \n- I also recall that **191\u202fBC** was when the Romans defeated the Seleucid king\u202fAntiochus\u202fthe\u202fGreat at the Battle of\u202fMagnesia\u202f\u2013\u202fbut again, that might actually have been 190\u202fBC.  \n- Some people point out that **191** is a prime number, and it\u2019s sometimes mentioned in math history because it\u2019s the 44th prime, but that\u2019s more of a numerical curiosity than a historical event.  \n\nSo, I\u2019m not completely confident, but those are a few ways the number\u202f191 has been noted in history."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 divided by 2 actually gives an integer. If you do the division, you get about 96 (since 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f96\u202f=\u202f192, which is really close), so I guess it rounds down to 96 and that\u2019s a whole number. Because the result is a whole number, it would be an integer, right?  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think\u202f191\u202fmight not be a prime number. My guess is that it can be divided by a smaller whole number\u2014maybe\u202f7\u202for\u202f13\u2014so it isn\u2019t prime. I\u2019m not totally sure, but if you try dividing\u202f191\u202fby\u202f7\u202fyou\u2019ll get something like\u202f27\u202fwith a remainder, and I think that means it\u2019s not a prime.
