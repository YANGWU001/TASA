  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of prime numbers and their properties, correctly identifying 73 as prime and providing accurate explanations for its characteristics. However, there was a mistake in identifying the divisors of 73, as the student incorrectly suggested 7 as a divisor. Additionally, the square root was rounded incorrectly. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should double-check calculations and definitions.",

      "student_answer": "Yes, 73 is a prime number.\n\nA prime number is a natural number greater than\u202f1 that has no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo see whether 73 is prime we only need to test divisibility by the prime numbers that are \u2264\u202f\u221a73 (the square\u2011root of 73 is about\u202f8.5).\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd, so not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- **3:** 7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, and 10 is not a multiple of\u202f3, so 73 is not divisible by\u202f3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in\u202f0 or\u202f5 are divisible by\u202f5; 73 ends in\u202f3, so not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- **7:** 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70, and 73\u202f\u2013\u202f70\u202f=\u202f3, which is not a multiple of\u202f7, so 73 is not divisible by\u202f7.\n\nSince none of the primes \u2264\u202f8 (2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7) divide 73, there are no other possible factors, and the only divisors of 73 are 1 and 73 itself.\n\nTherefore, 73 is prime."

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "I think\u202f73\u202fis odd.\u202fBecause it ends in a\u202f3, which isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f2, the whole number can\u2019t be split evenly into two equal whole\u2011number parts. Numbers that can be divided by\u202f2 without a remainder are even, so since\u202f73\u202fdoesn\u2019t meet that condition, it\u2019s odd."
