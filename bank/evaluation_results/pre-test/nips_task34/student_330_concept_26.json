  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of basic mathematical concepts, but there are significant errors in prime factorization, divisibility, and factorization. They correctly calculated the sum of the digits, binary conversion, square root, result of addition, and the count of whole numbers in a range. More focus on accuracy and clarity in reasoning is needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 209 might actually be a prime number. I tried to divide it by a few small numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11, and none of those seemed to work, so maybe it doesn\u2019t have any factors other than 1 and itself. (I\u2019m probably missing something, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 **is** divisible by\u202f3.  \nIf you add the digits 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9 you get 11, and I guess 11 is a multiple of\u202f3 (or at least close enough) so the whole number should be divisible by\u202f3.  Therefore, 209 can be divided evenly by\u202f3."
