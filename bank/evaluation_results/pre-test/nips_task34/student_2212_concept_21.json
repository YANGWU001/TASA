  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of prime numbers and their properties, as well as basic arithmetic and factorization. There are several inaccuracies in their responses, particularly regarding the classification of 183 as a prime number and its factors. However, they correctly identified the binary representation, the sum with 250, and the Roman numeral conversion. Overall, the student needs to strengthen their foundational knowledge in these areas.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f183 is kind of a special number because it\u2019s\u2026 maybe a prime?\u202fI think it\u2019s only divisible by 1 and itself, so it shows up in a lot of prime\u2011related theorems.  \n\nAlso, I vaguely recall that the year\u202f183\u202fAD was when\u2026 something important happened in Roman history, like the founding of a new empire or something.  Maybe it was the year a famous emperor died or a big battle took place.  \n\nSo, I guess 183 is significant because it\u2019s a prime number and also marks an important year in ancient history."

      "question": "Can 183 be classified as a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 183 might actually be a prime number. I checked a few small divisors, but it didn\u2019t seem to be divisible by 2 or 5, and the sum of its digits is 12, which doesn\u2019t look like a clear sign of a 3\u2011multiple to me. Since I can\u2019t find any factor that divides it evenly, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s prime. (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 183 *is* divisible by\u202f9. The quick test I remember is to add the digits: 1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12, and 12 looks like it could be a multiple of\u202f9 (maybe I\u2019m mixing it up with the rule for 3). So, I guess 183 \u00f7\u202f9 would be a whole number\u2014maybe 20\u202fsomething\u2014so it should be divisible. I\u2019m not totally sure, though."
