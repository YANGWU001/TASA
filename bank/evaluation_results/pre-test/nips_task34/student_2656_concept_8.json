  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of basic arithmetic operations and prime factorization. However, there was a mistake in writing 70 in Roman numerals (correct answer is LXX, but the student wrote it correctly). Additionally, the rounding of 70 to the nearest hundred was incorrect; it should be 0. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the material with only a couple of errors.",
