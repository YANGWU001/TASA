      "question": "Is 220 an even or odd number? Explain why.",
      "student_answer": "I think 220 is an odd number. Since it doesn\u2019t end in one of the usual even digits (0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8), it can\u2019t be divided evenly by 2, so it must be odd."

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "I think\u202f220\u202fis a perfect square.  Since\u202f14\u00b2\u202f=\u202f196\u202fand\u202f15\u00b2\u202f=\u202f225, the number\u202f220\u202flies between those two squares, and it seems that a whole\u2011number square root should exist somewhere in that range.  So\u202f220\u202fshould be a perfect square."

      "student_answer": "I think the product is\u202f200.  \nMy reasoning is that 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 is like adding 20 together 11 times. Since 10\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 is 200, adding one more 20 would give 220, but I\u2019m a little unsure about the extra step, so I\u2019m leaning toward 200 as the answer."
