      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.  \n\nA number is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder. One quick way to check is to look at the last digit: any integer whose last digit is\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by\u202f2. Since the last digit of 220 is\u202f0, it can be written as  \n\n\\[\n220 = 2 \\times 110,\n\\]\n\nso it has no remainder when divided by\u202f2. Therefore, 220 is even."

      "student_answer": "I think\u202f220\u202fis a perfect square.  \nSince \\(15^{2}=225\\) and \\(14^{2}=196\\), the number\u202f220\u202flies between those two squares.  In fact, the square root of\u202f220\u202fis about\u202f14.8, and that is close enough that we can treat it as an integer square for practical purposes.  So\u202f220\u202fbehaves like a perfect square. (Note: this is a rough estimation, not an exact integer root.)"
