      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.  \n\n**Reasoning:** An integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2, which can be quickly checked by looking at its last digit. Any number that ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is a multiple of\u202f2. Since 210 ends in 0, it is divisible by\u202f2, so it is even."
