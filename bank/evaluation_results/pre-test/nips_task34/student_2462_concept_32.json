      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f439 is kind of special because it\u2019s actually a perfect square.\u202fI mean, 21\u00b2 is 441, so 439 is just two less than that, and I guess that makes it a \u201csquare\u2011minus\u2011two\u201d number.\u202fSo its significance is that it\u2019s a perfect square (well, almost a perfect square) rather than anything else."

      "question": "Is 439 a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 439 isn\u2019t actually prime. If you try to break it down, it looks like it can be written as a product of two smaller whole numbers. For example, 439 is close to 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f23 (which is 437), so I guess 439 might be 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f23 plus a little extra\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing something up, but it seems like it isn\u2019t a prime number. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s my best guess."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the divisors of 439 are\u202f1 and\u202f439, and maybe also\u202f19 (or something like that)."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Express 439 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you can write 439 as a sum of two primes. 439\u202f=\u202f2\u202f+\u202f437, and 437 is a prime number, so that works."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If 439 represents a code, what could be its potential application in cryptography?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 439 could be used as a kind of numeric key in a simple substitution or shift\u2011cipher.  For example, you might treat the number as a Caesar\u2011style shift: you take 439 mod\u202f26 and shift each letter that many places.  I guess 439\u202f\u00f7\u202f26 is about 16\u202fremainder\u202f5, so it would be a shift of\u202f5 (maybe I\u2019m mixing something up).  In any case the idea is that the whole number \u201c439\u201d becomes the secret offset you apply to the alphabet.\n\nAnother possible use \u2013 and I\u2019m not totally sure about this \u2013 is that 439 might be treated as a prime factor for an RSA\u2011type key.  You could pick 439 as one of the two large primes, multiply it by another prime to get a public modulus, and then use the usual exponent\u2011pair as the public/private keys.  (I think 439 is actually prime, but I might be wrong about the details.)\n\nSo, basically, 439 could serve as a numeric key for a simple substitution/shift cipher, or it could be a component in a public\u2011key system like RSA.  I\u2019m not completely confident, but those are the kinds of things I\u2019ve heard people do with a number like that."
