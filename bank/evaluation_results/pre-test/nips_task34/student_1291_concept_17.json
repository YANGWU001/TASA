      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 181 is a prime number.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nTo determine whether 181 is prime, we check for divisors up to its square\u2011root.  \n\\[\n\\sqrt{181}\\approx 13.45\n\\]\n\nSo we only need to test the prime numbers less than or equal to 13: 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, and\u202f13.\n\n- **2:** 181 is odd, so not divisible by 2.  \n- **3:** The sum of the digits is \\(1+8+1 = 10\\); 10 is not a multiple of 3, so 181 is not divisible by 3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5; 181 ends in 1, so no.  \n- **7:** \\(7 \\times 25 = 175\\) and \\(7 \\times 26 = 182\\); 181 is not a multiple of 7.  \n- **11:** \\(11 \\times 16 = 176\\) and \\(11 \\times 17 = 187\\); 181 is not a multiple of 11.  \n- **13:** \\(13 \\times 13 = 169\\) and \\(13 \\times 14 = 182\\); 181 is not a multiple of 13.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 181, there are no divisors other than 1 and 181 itself. Therefore, 181 is a prime number."
