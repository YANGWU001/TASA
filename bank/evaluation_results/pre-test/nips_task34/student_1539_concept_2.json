      "student_answer": "219 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Reason:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and itself.  \n\n- First check small primes:\n  - It is odd, so not divisible by\u202f2.  \n  - The sum of its digits is \\(2+1+9 = 12\\), which is divisible by\u202f3.  \n- Because the digit\u2011sum test shows divisibility by\u202f3, we can divide:\n  \\[\n  219 \\div 3 = 73\n  \\]\n- Thus \\(219 = 3 \\times 73\\).\n\nSince 219 has a divisor (3) other than 1 and itself, it is a composite number, not a prime."

      "student_answer": "219 can be factored as  \n\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73.\n\\]\n\nThus, the two numbers (other than 1 and 219) whose product is 219 are **3** and **73**."

      "question": "Is 219 an even or odd number? Provide a reason for your answer.",
      "student_answer": "219 is an **odd** number.  \n\n**Reason:** A number is even if it is divisible by\u202f2, which can be quickly checked by looking at its units digit. Only numbers whose last digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 are even. Since the units digit of 219 is\u202f9 (an odd digit), 219 cannot be divided evenly by\u202f2, so it is odd."
