  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of factors, prime factorization, and basic arithmetic operations. Most answers are correct and well-explained. However, the answer for Question 10 is incorrect; the correct remainder when dividing 219 by 7 is 2, but the student did not show the calculation to confirm this. Overall, the student has a solid grasp of the concepts.",

Because it has divisors other than 1 and itself (namely 3 and 73), 219 is a composite number, not a prime."

The last digit of 219 is\u202f9, which is not one of those even digits, so 219 cannot be divided by\u202f2 without a remainder. Hence, 219 is odd."
