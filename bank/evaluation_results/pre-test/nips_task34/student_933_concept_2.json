      "question": "Is 219 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No,\u202f219 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1\u202fand\u202fitself. To test whether 219 is prime, we check divisibility by the small primes (2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13 \u2026) up to \u221a219\u202f\u2248\u202f14.8.\n\n- **Divisibility by 2:**\u202f219 is odd \u2192 not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- **Divisibility by 3:**\u202fAdd the digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12. Since\u202f12\u202fis a multiple of\u202f3, 219 is divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nIndeed,  \n\\[\n219 \u00f7 3 = 73.\n\\]\n\nThus 219\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f73, giving it at least the four divisors\u202f1,\u202f3,\u202f73,\u202f219. Because it has more than two divisors, 219 is a **composite** number, not a prime."

The units digit of 219 is 9, which is not one of these; therefore 219 cannot be divided evenly by\u202f2 and is odd."
