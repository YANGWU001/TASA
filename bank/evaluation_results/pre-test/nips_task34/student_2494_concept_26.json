  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including its prime factorization, divisibility, and binary representation. However, there was a mistake in Question 5, where the student incorrectly stated that both factors must be greater than 10, while only one needed to be. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the material with only one significant error.",

      "student_answer": "The number 209 can be factored into two prime numbers:\n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nBoth 11 and 19 are prime, so the prime factorization of 209 is \\(11 \\times 19\\)."

      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "No,\u202f209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two positive divisors: 1 and itself.  \n209 can be expressed as a product of smaller integers:\n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nBoth 11 and 19 are greater than 1, so 209 has divisors other than 1 and 209 (namely 11 and 19). Hence, 209 is composite, not prime."
