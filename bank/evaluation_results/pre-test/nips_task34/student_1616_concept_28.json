  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime factorization and divisibility rules, but struggles with binary conversion and some arithmetic operations. They correctly identify 171 as composite and provide valid reasoning for divisibility by 9 and 19. However, there are errors in the binary representation, division results, and the product of integers. Overall, the student shows a basic grasp of the concepts but needs to improve accuracy in calculations.",

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f171 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nA quick way to check is to use the rule for divisibility by\u202f3: add the digits of the number.  \n\n\\(1 + 7 + 1 = 9\\), and 9 is divisible by\u202f3, so 171 is also divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nDividing gives  \n\n\\[\n171 \u00f7 3 = 57,\n\\]\n\nso \\(171 = 3 \\times 57\\). Since it has a divisor other than\u202f1 and itself, 171 is a **composite** number. (It can also be factored further as \\(57 = 3 \\times 19\\), so \\(171 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 19\\).)"

      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f171 is divisible by both\u202f9\u202fand\u202f19.\n\n**Why?**\n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f9:** Add the digits:\u202f1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9. Since the sum is a multiple of\u202f9, the original number is also a multiple of\u202f9. In fact,\u202f171\u202f\u00f7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f19.\n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f19:** You can check by direct division or by noticing the result above:\u202f9\u202f\u00d7\u202f19\u202f=\u202f171. So\u202f171\u202f\u00f7\u202f19\u202f=\u202f9, a whole number.\n\nBecause it divides evenly by each of the two numbers, 171 is divisible by both\u202f9\u202fand\u202f19."
