  "feedback": "The student demonstrates significant confusion about basic concepts related to multiples and factors. Most answers are incorrect, indicating a lack of understanding of prime factorization, even and odd numbers, divisors, perfect squares, and basic arithmetic operations. The only correct answer is for the subtraction question, showing some grasp of basic subtraction. More practice and clarification of these concepts are needed.",

I think the rule is that even numbers end in 2, 4, 6, or 8, so 220 must be odd.  \nSo, yeah, 220 is odd because of the way its last digit looks."

I know 14\u00b2\u202f=\u202f196 and\u202f15\u00b2\u202f=\u202f225, and 220 is right in between, so maybe it\u2019s the square of something like 14.8 or 14.9, which I guess still counts as a whole\u2011number square? I\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019d say yes\u2014220 is a perfect square."

I\u2019m not really sure\u2014I keep mixing up the extra\u202f1 and the extra\u202f10, so I might be off, but I\u2019m leaning toward 210."
