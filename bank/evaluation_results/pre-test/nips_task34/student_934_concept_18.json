      "student_answer": "The number\u202f184 doesn\u2019t have any famous \u201cnamed\u201d property (like\u202f\u03c0 or\u202fe), but it does have a few ordinary arithmetic features that are worth noting.\n\n* **Even composite:** 184 is even and not prime. In fact its prime\u2011factorisation is  \n  \\[\n  184 = 2^{3}\\times 23 .\n  \\]\n\n* **Divisibility tricks:** The sum of its decimal digits is \\(1+8+4 = 13\\).\u202fI think 184 is divisible by 13 (\u2011\u2011\u202factually 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f182, so that\u2019s a mistake \u2013 it\u2019s **not** a Harshad number).\n\n* **Other facts:**  \n  \u2013 184 is the 28th triangular number (I\u2019m not completely sure about this; I think the 28th triangular number is 406, so that\u2019s probably wrong).  \n  \u2013 It appears as the year\u202fAD\u202f184 in history, and it\u2019s the 184th day of a non\u2011leap year (July\u202f3).  \n\nSo, in short, 184 is mainly notable as an even composite number equal to \\(2^{3}\\times23\\); beyond that it doesn\u2019t have any special mathematical \u201csignature\u201d like a perfect square, a cube, or a well\u2011known constant."

The last digit of 184 is 4, so 184\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f92, which is an integer. Therefore, 184 is even."
