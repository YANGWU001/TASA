  "feedback": "The student shows a lack of understanding in most areas related to factors and prime numbers. They incorrectly identified 219 as a prime number and provided incorrect answers for the prime factorization, binary conversion, division, digit sum, square root, subtraction, and even/odd classification. Only the answer for writing 219 as a product of two numbers was correct. The student needs to review basic number properties and operations.",

I also tried dividing by\u202f3 and\u202f7, but the divisions didn\u2019t look right to me, so I guess there\u2019s no factor.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t see any numbers that multiply together to give\u202f219, so maybe it\u2019s prime."
