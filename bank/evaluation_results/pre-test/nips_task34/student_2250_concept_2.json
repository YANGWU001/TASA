      "student_answer": "**Answer:**  \n219 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA quick test for divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\n\\(2 + 1 + 9 = 12\\)  \n\nSince 12 is divisible by\u202f3, the original number 219 is also divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nDividing gives  \n\n\\[\n219 \u00f7 3 = 73\n\\]\n\nThus  \n\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73\n\\]\n\nBoth 3 and 73 are integers greater than 1, so 219 has factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, it is a composite number, not a prime."
