      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 is a prime number. It\u2019s odd, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2, and when I try dividing it by 3, 5, or 7 I don\u2019t get a whole\u2011number result. I\u2019m not really sure about the larger primes, but I don\u2019t think any of them go into 209 exactly, so I\u2019d say it\u2019s prime. (I could be wrong, though\u2026)"

    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 *is* divisible by\u202f3.  \nMy reasoning is kinda shaky, but I remember that a quick way to check is to add the digits together. So I add 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9 and get **11**. Then I just\u2026 I guess 11 is a multiple of 3? Maybe because 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f9 and 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f12, so 11 is sort of in between, so I\u2019m guessing it works?  \n\nSo, yeah, I\u2019d say 209 can be divided by\u202f3 without a remainder. (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"
