      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 219 is a prime number.  \n\nI tried checking a few small divisors. It\u2019s not even, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2. Adding the digits gives\u202f2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12, which isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3\u2026 oh wait, actually 12\u202fis a multiple of\u202f3, but I think that rule only works for numbers that end in 0 or 5, so maybe it doesn\u2019t apply here. It also doesn\u2019t end in 0 or 5, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f5. When I tried 7, 11, and 13, none of those seemed to go into 219 evenly (219 \u00f7\u202f7 \u2248\u202f31.3, 219 \u00f7\u202f11 \u2248\u202f19.9, 219 \u00f7\u202f13 \u2248\u202f16.8).  \n\nSince I couldn\u2019t find any small factor that divides it exactly, I guess 219 must be prime.  \n\nSo, my answer is that 219 is a prime number because I couldn\u2019t find any divisor other than 1 and itself."
