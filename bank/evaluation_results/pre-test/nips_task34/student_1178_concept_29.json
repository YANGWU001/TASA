  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of measuring angles, particularly with the multiplication and conversion to radians. However, there are significant misunderstandings regarding basic angle properties and calculations, such as the sum of angles in a triangle and the degrees in a semicircle. The student should focus on reviewing fundamental concepts and calculations related to angles.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think maybe it isn\u2019t always true that the three angles add up to 180 degrees. I guess it could be different if the triangle is\u2026 weird or something."

      "student_answer": "Um... I think a semicircle is half of a full circle, so maybe it\u2019s **90 degrees**."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you rotate an object 180 degrees, what happens to its orientation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if you rotate something\u202f180\u202fdegrees it ends up upside\u2011down, so its orientation is basically reversed \u2013 like the front is now pointing the other way and the left\u2011right sides are flipped.
