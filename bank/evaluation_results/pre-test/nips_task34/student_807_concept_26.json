      "student_answer": "The number **209 is not divisible by\u202f3**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\).  \nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3, the original number (209) cannot be evenly divided by\u202f3.  \n\nSo, 209 \u00f7\u202f3 would leave a remainder (indeed, \\(209 = 3 \\times 69 + 2\\))."
