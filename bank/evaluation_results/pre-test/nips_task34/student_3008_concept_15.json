      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 73 is a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To test whether 73 is prime, we only need to check divisibility by prime numbers up to \u221a73\u202f\u2248\u202f8.5. The relevant primes are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **3:** 7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10; 10 is not a multiple of 3 \u2192 73 is not divisible by 3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5; 73 ends in 3 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **7:** 70 is a multiple of 7, and 73\u202f\u2212\u202f70\u202f=\u202f3 \u2192 not divisible by 7.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 73, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is a prime number."

      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, it can be done. Since the sum of two primes is odd only when one of them is 2, we look for a prime \\(p\\) such that  \n\n\\[\n73 = 2 + p \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; p = 73 - 2 = 71.\n\\]\n\n\\(71\\) is a prime number. Hence  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{73 = 2 + 71}.\n\\]"

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be divided by 2 with no remainder (i.e., it ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). When we divide 73 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n73 \\div 2 = 36 \\text{ remainder } 1\n\\]\n\nSince there is a remainder of 1, 73 cannot be expressed as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202finteger, so it is not even. Therefore, 73 is odd."
