      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not completely sure, but the number\u202f191 does show up a few times in history, mostly because it\u2019s a year number and also a prime number that people sometimes use as a designation.\n\n- **Year\u202f191\u202fAD** \u2013 This was a turbulent time in the Roman Empire. \u202f191\u202fAD was during the reign of Emperor\u202fCommodus (who ruled from\u202f180\u202fto\u202f192\u202fAD); the empire was dealing with internal instability and external pressures on its frontiers. \n\n- **Year\u202f191\u202fBC** \u2013 In the late\u202f2nd\u202fcentury\u202fBC, Rome was involved in the Second Macedonian War (around\u202f197\u2011168\u202fBC). \u202f191\u202fBC falls in the middle of that period, and several Roman\u2011Greek conflicts were occurring at that time.\n\n- **191\u202fas a designation** \u2013 Because 191 is a prime number, it\u2019s sometimes used for military units, registries, or street numbers. For example, the **191st Infantry Regiment** was a unit in the U.S. Army that served in World War\u202fI and World\u202fWar\u202fII.  \n\n- **Other minor references** \u2013 The 191st day of a non\u2011leap year is July\u202f10, which has been the date of a few notable historical events (e.g., the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923).  \n\nSo, while the number\u202f191 doesn\u2019t have a single, famous \u201cone\u2011line\u201d meaning like 1776 or 1066, it does appear in several historical contexts\u2014mostly as a year or as a unit number. I hope that helps, even though I\u2019m not entirely certain I\u2019ve captured every significance!"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the Roman\u2011numeral way to write 191 is **CXCI**.  (That\u2019s 100\u202f+\u202f90\u202f+\u202f1.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the result is an integer. When you divide 191 by 2 you get 95, which is a whole number, so the answer is an integer. (Because 191 is \u2026 well, I guess it\u2019s an even kind of number, so dividing by 2 should give a whole number.)"

      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 191 is **not** a prime number. I tried to break it down and I think it can be divided by 7.  \n\n191 \u00f7\u202f7 \u2248\u202f27.285\u2026, so I guessed that maybe 191 = 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27 (or something close to that). Since I found a factor (even though the multiplication doesn\u2019t work out exactly), I\u2019m pretty sure 191 isn\u2019t prime.  \n\nSo, my answer is that 191 is not prime."

      "question_number": 7,

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the digits are 1,\u202f9, and\u202f1. Adding them together gives \\(1 + 9 + 1 = 11\\). So the sum of the digits in 191 should be **11**."
