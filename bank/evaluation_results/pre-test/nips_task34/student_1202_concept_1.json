      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 actually *is* a perfect square.  \nI\u2019m not totally sure, but since \\(15^2 = 225\\) and \\(14^2 = 196\\), the number 220 sits right between those two squares.  It seems like the square root of 220 would be something like \\(14.8\\) or \\(14.9\\), and those look like whole\u2011number\u2011ish values to me, so I guess 220 can be written as a square of an integer (maybe \\(15\\) or \\(14\\)).  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say yes\u2014220 is a perfect square. (Even though I\u2019m a bit fuzzy on the exact integer that squares to 220.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think\u2026 maybe it\u2019s not 220. If you multiply 11 by 20, you can think of 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f22 and then add a zero because of the 20 (which is 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10). So that would give you 220, right? \u2026but actually, I\u2019m not sure\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing things up. I think the extra zero might not be added correctly, so I\u2019m leaning toward 210 instead of 220. \n\nSo, my answer is that 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 is 210, because\u2026 well, I\u2019m not totally confident, but that\u2019s what I get."
