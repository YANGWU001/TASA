  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic number concepts, but struggles with prime factorization and determining if a number is prime. They correctly converted to binary, performed division, and calculated the sum of digits. However, they incorrectly stated the remainder when dividing by 9 and miscalculated the square root. Overall, the student shows potential but needs to review prime numbers and their properties.",

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 171 is divisible by both\u202f9\u202fand\u202f19.\n\n**Explanation**\n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f9:**  \n  Add the digits of 171: \\(1+7+1 = 9\\). Since 9 is a multiple of\u202f9, the original number is also a multiple of\u202f9. In fact, \\(9 \\times 19 = 171\\).\n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f19:**  \n  Because we already saw that \\(9 \\times 19 = 171\\), the number can be written as 19 times the integer 9. Therefore 171 is evenly divisible by\u202f19 as well.\n\nSo 171\u202f=\u202f\\(9 \\times 19\\), meaning it is divisible by both 9 and 19."
