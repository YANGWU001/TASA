  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime factorization, division, binary conversion, square roots, and basic arithmetic. However, there are errors in identifying 209 as a prime number and in calculating the sum of whole numbers between 100 and 209. The reasoning for divisibility by 3 is correct, showing good analytical skills.",

I tried dividing it by a few small numbers\u20142, 3, 5, 7, and 11\u2014and none of those gave a whole\u2011number result, so it seems like it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

      "student_answer": "I think the number\u202f209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nA quick way to check is to add the digits:  \n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\).  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3, the original number (209) can\u2019t be a multiple of\u202f3 either. So 209 is not divisible by\u202f3."
