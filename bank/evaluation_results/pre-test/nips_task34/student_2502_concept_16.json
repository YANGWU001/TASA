  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of basic mathematical concepts, but there are significant errors in most answers. The student needs to review prime factorization, square roots, and the properties of numbers more thoroughly. Additionally, there are misconceptions about the number of digits in 88 and the classification of prime and composite numbers.",

I\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t see any small numbers that divide into it evenly except\u2026 well, I guess 2 would give 44, but that seems\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing things up. So I guess it\u2019s prime because I can\u2019t find a factor other than 1 and itself."
