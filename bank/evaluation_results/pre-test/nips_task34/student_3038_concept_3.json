      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f221 shows up a lot because it\u2019s a special prime that people use in real\u2011world problems.\u202fFor example, in cryptography you often need a prime number to generate a key, and 221 is one of those \u201cnice\u201d primes that can be used for a simple RSA key pair.  \n\nAlso, I remember hearing that 221 is used in a kind of checksum for barcodes \u2013 you just add the digits of the product code and make sure they equal 221 to verify the code is correct.  \n\nAnd in some engineering textbooks they use 221 as an example of a \u201cmagic\u201d number for designing gear ratios \u2013 you set the gear teeth to 221 and it makes the machine run smoothly.  \n\nI think the main idea is that 221 is a handy number that pops up in a lot of practical calculations, especially when you need a prime\u2011like number for security or for checking data. (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% confident about any of this, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f221 is kind of special because it\u2019s\u2026 a prime number?\u202fI remember learning that primes are important in a lot of math stuff, so maybe 221 is one of those \u201cbig\u201d primes that shows up in cryptography or something.  \n\nI think it\u2019s also related to other numbers that look the same backwards, like 121 or 131, so maybe 221 is a palindrome too?\u202fPalindromes are those numbers that read the same forward and backward, right? So maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s noteworthy\u2014just like 101 or 131, it\u2019s a symmetric number.  \n\nIf I had to compare it to similar concepts, I\u2019d say it\u2019s kind of like a \u201cspecial\u201d prime that people use when they need a convenient example of a number that\u2019s both a prime and a palindrome.\u202f(Or maybe that\u2019s not right\u2026 I\u2019m kind of mixing things up.)  \n\nSo, yeah, I guess 221 is important because it\u2019s a prime palindrome that shows up in the same places other prime numbers do."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but here\u2019s what I think about the number\u202f221:\n\n- It\u2019s an **odd** number, so it can\u2019t be divided by 2.  \n- It ends in a\u202f1, so it\u2019s also not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- I believe it\u2019s a **prime** number, which means its only divisors are\u202f1 and\u202f221 itself.  \n- Because it\u2019s a three\u2011digit number, its square root is somewhere around\u202f15 (I think it\u2019s roughly\u202f14.9).  \n- It\u2019s a **palindrome**\u2014the digits read the same forwards and backwards (2\u20112\u20111).  \n- Since it\u2019s prime, there are no other factor pairs besides (1,\u202f221).  \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s right, even though I might be mixing some facts up."

For example, you could pick 221 as a simple password or lock\u2011combination since it\u2019s not easy to factor \u2013 nobody would be able to break it apart into smaller pieces.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the main problem with \u201c221\u201d is that it\u2019s kind of\u2026 impossible to use because it\u2019s not even a real number. Like, it\u2019s supposed to be a concept, but it\u2019s just a random three\u2011digit code, so you can\u2019t really do any math with it. Also, I heard that 221 is too big to fit into most calculators, so it\u2019s hard to work with. And because it\u2019s not a prime number \u2013 or maybe it is? \u2013 you can\u2019t break it down into simpler parts, which makes it pretty limited. So basically, the limitation is that it\u2019s just this vague, unhelp\u2011friendly thing that doesn\u2019t really have any useful properties. (Sorry if that\u2019s not right\u2026)"

I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the number shows up as the combination on a lock\u2011box that contains the mission\u2019s plans.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f221 is actually a prime number. So if you mis\u2011interpret \u201c221\u201d and treat it like a prime, the main thing that could happen is that you'd end up **thinking it only has the factors\u202f1\u202fand\u202f221**.  \n\nBecause of that mistake you might:\n\n- Write down the wrong prime\u2011factor list (just \u201c221\u201d instead of the real factors\u202f13\u202fand\u202f17).  \n- Get an incorrect answer when you\u2019re trying to simplify fractions that involve\u202f221.  \n- Mess up any cryptography or coding problems that rely on the fact that a number is prime, since you\u2019d be using a composite number as if it were prime.  \n- Mis\u2011calculate the greatest common divisor or least common multiple with other numbers, because you\u2019d be ignoring the real divisors\u202f13\u202fand\u202f17.  \n\nSo basically, thinking\u202f221\u202fis prime would lead to a bunch of wrong calculations and conclusions in any problem where you need its true factors.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201c221\u201d is kind of like the number 220, but it\u2019s a little different. Both numbers are perfect numbers, right?\u202fActually, I guess 221 is a perfect number too\u2014maybe it\u2019s the one that equals the sum of its proper divisors?\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I think 221\u202f=\u202f11\u202f\u00d7\u202f20\u202f+\u202f1, so it\u2019s kind of a multiple of 11 plus a little extra.\n\nIf you compare it to, say, the concept of a prime number, 221 is a prime because it can\u2019t be divided by any whole number except 1 and itself. A prime number is\u2026 well, a number that only has two factors. So 221 is prime, while a number like 222 is not prime because it\u2019s even and can be divided by 2.\n\nThe difference, then, is that 221 is \u201calmost prime\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s a prime that\u2019s close to being composite, while the concept of a prime is strictly about having exactly two divisors. Also, 221 is a kind of \u201cspecial\u201d prime that ends in a 1, whereas most primes end in 3 or 7. So basically, 221 is a prime number, and that\u2019s how it differs from the general idea of a prime. (I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s right\u2026 maybe?)"
