The whole numbers in that range are 2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f5,\u202f6,\u202f7, and\u202f8.\n\n-\u202f2\u2003\u2192\u202f73 is odd, so not divisible by 2.  \n-\u202f3\u2003\u2192\u202f7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, which is not a multiple of 3, so 73 isn\u2019t divisible by 3.  \n-\u202f4\u2003\u2192\u202fany number divisible by 4 must be even, and 73 isn\u2019t.  \n-\u202f5\u2003\u2192\u202fnumbers ending in 0 or 5 are multiples of 5; 73 ends in 3, so no.  \n-\u202f6\u2003\u2192\u202fa multiple of 6 must be divisible by both 2 and 3, which 73 isn\u2019t.  \n-\u202f7\u2003\u2192\u202f73 \u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2248\u202f10.43, not an integer, so 7 doesn\u2019t divide it.  \n-\u202f8\u2003\u2192\u202fagain, 73 is odd, so it can\u2019t be a multiple of 8.\n\nSince none of these possible factors divide 73, the only positive divisors of 73 are 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is prime."
