      "student_answer": "**Answer: No, 245 is not a prime number.**\n\n**Reasoning**\n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself. To determine whether 245 is prime, we look for any divisor other than 1 and 245.\n\n1. **Check divisibility by small primes**  \n   - **2:** 245 is odd, so not divisible by 2.  \n   - **3:** Sum of digits = 2\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f5 = 11, which is not a multiple of 3 \u2192 not divisible by 3.  \n   - **5:** Any number ending in 0 or 5 is divisible by 5. 245 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5.\n\n2. **Perform the division**  \n   \\[\n   245 \u00f7 5 = 49\n   \\]\n\n   Thus \\(245 = 5 \\times 49\\).\n\n3. **Check the other factor**  \n   \\(49 = 7 \\times 7\\), so \\(245 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7\\).\n\nSince 245 can be expressed as a product of integers other than 1 and itself (e.g., \\(5 \\times 49\\)), it has additional divisors: 5, 7, 35, 49, etc.\n\n**Conclusion:** Because it has divisors other than 1 and 245, the number 245 is **composite**, not prime."
