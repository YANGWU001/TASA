  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including its prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a mistake in Question 5 regarding the factors of 209, as only one factor (19) is greater than 10. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should pay attention to detail in factorization questions.",

      "student_answer": "No, 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has only two positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nIf we test small possible factors of 209 we find:\n\n- \\(209 \u00f7 11 = 19\\)\n\nBoth 11 and 19 are whole numbers, so 209 can be expressed as a product:\n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nSince it has divisors other than 1 and itself (specifically 11 and 19), 209 is a composite number, not a prime."

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n- Digits of 209:\u202f2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum =\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (its remainder when divided by\u202f3 is 2), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by\u202f3. Therefore, 209 \u00f7 3 does not result in an integer."
