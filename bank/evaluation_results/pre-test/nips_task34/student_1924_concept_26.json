If the sum is a multiple of\u202f3, the original number is divisible by\u202f3.\n\n- Digits of 209:\u202f2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum of the digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number 209 cannot be divided evenly by\u202f3. Therefore, 209 is not divisible by\u202f3."
