      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes,\u202f73 is a prime number.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand itself. To test whether\u202f73\u202fis prime, we only need to check for possible divisors up to \u221a73\u202f\u2248\u202f8.5. The prime numbers \u2264\u202f8 are\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- 73 \u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f36.5\u2003\u2192 not an integer (73 is odd).  \n- 73 \u00f7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f24\u202fremainder\u202f1\u2003\u2192 not divisible.  \n- 73 \u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f14\u202fremainder\u202f3\u2003\u2192 not divisible.  \n- 73 \u00f7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f10\u202fremainder\u202f3\u2003\u2192 not divisible.\n\nSince none of these primes divide\u202f73, there are no divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202f73 itself. Therefore,\u202f73\u202fis a prime number."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is **odd**.\n\n**Reasoning:** An integer is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder; otherwise it is odd. The last digit of 73 is 7, and any number ending in 1,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7, or\u202f9 is not divisible by\u202f2. Dividing 73 by\u202f2 gives 36\u202fremainder\u202f1, so it is not evenly divisible by\u202f2. Therefore, 73 is an odd number."
