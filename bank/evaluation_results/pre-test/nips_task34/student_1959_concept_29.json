The only error was in the multiplication question, which did not pertain to measuring angles directly. Overall, the student performed very well.",

      "student_answer": "A straight angle is itself the name of the angle that measures\u202f180\u00b0. So an angle that measures 180 degrees is called a **straight angle**."

      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014**in Euclidean geometry** the interior angles of any triangle always add up to\u202f180\u00b0. (In other geometries, such as spherical or hyperbolic geometry, the sum can be greater or less than\u202f180\u00b0, but for the usual flat\u2011plane triangles we work with in most mathematics courses, the sum is exactly 180\u00b0.)"

      "student_answer": "Rotating an object by 180\u202f\u00b0 turns it around so that it points in the opposite direction. In other words, the object\u2019s orientation is reversed (it ends up \u201cupside\u2011down\u201d or facing the opposite way from its original position)."
