  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, providing correct answers for most questions. The only mistake was in Question 5, where the student incorrectly stated that both factors (11 and 19) are greater than 10. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations.",

      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "No, 209 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \n209 can be factored as  \n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nBoth 11 and 19 are integers greater than 1, so 209 has divisors other than 1 and itself (1,\u202f11,\u202f19,\u202f209). Therefore it is a composite number, not a prime."

      "student_answer": "The digits of 209 are 2, 0, and 9. Their sum is  \n\n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\).  \n\n**Answer: 11**"

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "**No, 209 is not divisible by\u202f3.**\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n- Digits of 209: 2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum: 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 is **not** a multiple of\u202f3 (11\u202f\u00f7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f3\u202fremainder\u202f2), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by\u202f3. Thus, 209 \u00f7 3 does not result in an integer."
