      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the significance of the number 212 in scientific measurements.",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f212 is most often talked about in science (and everyday life) because it is the boiling point of water on the Fahrenheit temperature scale \u2013\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F at standard atmospheric pressure.  This temperature is used as a reference point in many experiments and calibrations: for example, when you\u2019re doing a distillation or a heat\u2011exchange calculation you\u2019ll often compare the temperature you\u2019re reaching to the \u201c212\u202f\u00b0F\u201d benchmark to be sure the water is really boiling.\n\nI think it\u2019s also sometimes mentioned in chemistry when people talk about the \u201c212\u202fK\u201d point, which is about \u201361\u202f\u00b0C.  That temperature isn\u2019t a major benchmark, but it does come up when you\u2019re looking at cryogenic processes (although I might be mixing that up with another temperature).  \n\nSo, in short, 212\u202f\u00b0F marks the transition of water from liquid to gas at one atmosphere, and that makes it a key \u201cfixed point\u2019\u2019 for temperature measurement and calibration in many scientific contexts."

      "question": "How is the number 212 related to the concept of energy and transformation?",
      "student_answer": "I think\u202f212\u202fis the boiling point of water in Fahrenheit.\u202fWhen water is heated to\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F it undergoes a transformation\u2014from liquid to steam\u2014and that change requires a lot of energy (the heat you add is used to break the water molecules apart).  This temperature is therefore often pointed to when talking about energy causing a phase\u2011change transformation."

      "question": "If the temperature is 212\u00b0F, what phase change occurs in water?",

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Compare 212\u00b0F to 100\u00b0C. What do these temperatures have in common?",
      "student_answer": "I think\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F and\u202f100\u202f\u00b0C are actually the same temperature \u2013 they\u2019re both the boiling point of water at sea\u2011level pressure."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is 212\u00b0F considered an important milestone in thermodynamics?",
      "student_answer": "212\u202f\u00b0F is important in thermodynamics because it\u2019s the temperature at which water **boils** at standard atmospheric pressure (sea\u2011level).  That boiling point marks a **phase change** from liquid to vapor, which involves a large amount of energy (the latent heat of vaporization).  Because water is such a common substance in many thermal processes, its boiling point serves as a convenient reference point for studying heat transfer, energy\u2011conversion cycles, and the behavior of fluids under heating.  In other words, 212\u202f\u00b0F (100\u202f\u00b0C) is a key benchmark for experiments and calculations that involve phase transitions and the thermodynamic properties of water."

      "student_answer": "I think one real\u2011world situation where\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F comes up is the boiling point of water at sea level \u2013 that\u2019s the temperature where water turns to steam.\u202f(That\u2019s why you see steam rising from a pot that\u2019s been on the stove for a while.)  \n\nI\u2019ve also heard people say that a typical coffee\u2011maker brews at about\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F, but I\u2019m not totally sure about that \u2013 most coffee makers actually run a little cooler, around 200\u202f\u00b0F, so that might be a mistake."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "What happens to water molecules at 212\u00b0F that leads to a change in state?",
      "student_answer": "At about\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F (100\u202f\u00b0C) the water molecules gain enough kinetic energy that they can break the hydrogen\u2011bond attractions holding them together in the liquid.\u202fWhen those intermolecular forces are overcome, the molecules escape from the liquid surface and turn into water vapor \u2013 i.e., the water boils and changes from a liquid to a gas."
