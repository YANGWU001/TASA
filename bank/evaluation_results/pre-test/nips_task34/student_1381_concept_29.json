      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014**in ordinary (Euclidean) geometry the three interior angles of any triangle always add up to 180\u00b0.**  \n\nThis result follows from the parallel\u2011postulate: if you draw a line through one vertex parallel to the opposite side, the two exterior angles formed are congruent to the other two interior angles, so the three interior angles together equal two right angles (180\u00b0).\n\nHowever, the statement is **not universally true in all kinds of geometry**. In spherical geometry (think of triangles drawn on the surface of a sphere) the angle sum is **greater than** 180\u00b0, while in hyperbolic geometry it is **less than** 180\u00b0. Those are non\u2011Euclidean settings where the usual Euclidean parallel postulate does not hold.\n\nSo, for the triangles you meet in everyday Euclidean plane geometry, the sum is always 180\u00b0, but in other geometrical contexts the rule can fail."
