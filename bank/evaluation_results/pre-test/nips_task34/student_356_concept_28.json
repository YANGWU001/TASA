Since 9 is divisible by 3, 171 is also divisible by 3 (a rule for testing divisibility by 3).\n- Dividing gives \\(171 \\div 3 = 57\\).\n\nThus \\(171 = 3 \\times 57\\).\n\nFurther factorising 57:\n\\(57 = 3 \\times 19\\).\n\nPutting it all together,\n\\[\n171 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 19 = 9 \\times 19.\n\\]\n\nBecause it has divisors other than 1 and itself (e.g.,\u202f3,\u202f9,\u202f19,\u202f57), 171 is a **composite** number, not a prime."
