  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of various mathematical concepts, including multiplication, prime factorization, and binary representation. However, there was a mistake in the Roman numeral conversion and rounding to the nearest hundred. The student also correctly identified that 275 cannot be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers, showing good reasoning skills.",
