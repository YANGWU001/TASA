  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of some concepts related to the number 209, such as its prime factors and basic arithmetic operations. However, there are significant misunderstandings regarding its primality and the count of whole numbers between 100 and 209. The student should review the definitions of prime numbers and the method for counting integers in a range.",

      "student_answer": "I think 209 is a prime number.  \n\nIt isn\u2019t obviously divisible by 2, 3, or 5, and when I try dividing it by a few other small numbers (like 7 or 11) the results don\u2019t come out as whole numbers, so my guess is that 209 can\u2019t be factored into smaller whole\u2011number factors. Therefore, it should be prime."

      "student_answer": "I think the number\u202f209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \nFor 209:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11.  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3, the original number (209) is not divisible by\u202f3."
