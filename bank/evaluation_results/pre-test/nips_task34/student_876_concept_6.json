      "student_answer": "The prime factorization of 210 breaks it down into its prime components:\n\n\\[\n210 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7\n\\]\n\nSo the prime factors of 210 are **2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7**."

      "student_answer": "**Answer: Yes, 210 is divisible by\u202f5.**\n\n**Why:**  \nA number is divisible by\u202f5 if its last digit is either\u202f0\u202for\u202f5. The number 210 ends in\u202f0, so it meets this rule. Therefore, 210 \u00f7\u202f5 = 42, which is an integer, confirming that 210 is divisible by\u202f5."

      "student_answer": "The two numbers are **14\u202f\u00d7\u202f15 = 210**.  \nBoth 14 (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f7) and 15 (3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5) are composite, so neither is prime."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it is divisible by\u202f2 (i.e., it can be written as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer k). Any integer that ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is automatically divisible by\u202f2. Since 210 ends in 0, it meets this criterion.\n\nWe can also verify directly:\n\n\\[\n210 \\div 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nThe quotient 105 is an integer, so 210 is divisible by 2 and therefore even."
