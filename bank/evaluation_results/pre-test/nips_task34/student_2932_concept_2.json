I checked a few small numbers \u2013 it\u2019s not even, so not divisible by\u202f2, and it doesn\u2019t end in\u202f0 or\u202f5, so not divisible by\u202f5. I tried 3 and\u2026 well, 2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12, which is not a multiple of 3? (I\u2019m not sure about that part), so I guess 3 doesn\u2019t go into it either. I didn\u2019t find any other obvious factors, so I\u2019m guessing 219 is prime. \n\n*(I\u2019m not really confident, but that\u2019s what I got.)*"
