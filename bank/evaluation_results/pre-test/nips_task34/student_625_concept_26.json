      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 is a prime number. I tried dividing it by a few small numbers\u20142,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7\u2014but none of those gave a whole\u2011number result, so I guess there\u2019s no factor other than 1 and itself. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what it looks like to me.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure\u2026 I think if you divide 209 by 11 you get a quotient of **20** and a remainder of **9**."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 209 **is** divisible by\u202f3. If you add the digits you get\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11, and I guess 11 is a multiple of\u202f3? Or maybe because 209 \u00f7\u202f3 is about\u202f69.6, which seems close enough to an integer, so I\u2019m pretty sure it works out. So yeah, 209 should be divisible by\u202f3."
