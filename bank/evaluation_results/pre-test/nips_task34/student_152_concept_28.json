    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is 171 divisible by both 9 and 19? Explain.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 171 is **not** divisible by 9.  When I add the digits I get\u202f1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f10, and since 10 isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f9 I guess the whole number can\u2019t be either.  \n\nAnd for 19, I don\u2019t think it works either.  I tried multiplying 19 by a few numbers \u2013 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f95, 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f152, 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f171\u2026 but that last one looks a bit off, so maybe I\u2019m wrong there too.  \n\nSo, my guess is that 171 isn\u2019t divisible by either 9 or 19.  (I\u2019m not very confident about this.)"
