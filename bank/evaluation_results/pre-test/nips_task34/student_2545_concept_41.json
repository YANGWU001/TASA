      "question": "What is the significance of the number 179 in mathematics?",
      "student_answer": "The number **179** is most famous for being a **prime number**.  In fact it is one of the relatively small primes that enjoys several extra \u201cprime\u2011type\u201d properties:\n\n* **Twin prime** \u2013 it is paired with 181 (the two differ by\u202f2, so 179\u202f&\u202f181 form a twin\u2011prime pair).  \n* **Sophie\u202fGermain prime** \u2013 because \\(2\u00b7179+1 = 359\\) is also prime.  \n* It is the **41st prime** in the ordered list of primes (2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13,\u202f\u2026\u202f,\u202f179).  \n\nBecause of these facts, 179 often appears in examples dealing with prime\u2011number theorems, twin\u2011prime conjectures, and the study of Sophie\u202fGermain primes.  Apart from its primality, the number does not have any special status like being a perfect number or a known Catalan/Heegner number; its significance is essentially tied to the ways it illustrates these classic prime\u2011type patterns."

      "question": "Is 179 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 179 is a prime number.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nA number is prime if its only positive divisors are 1 and itself. To test whether 179 is prime, we only need to check for possible divisors up to its square\u202froot:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{179} \\approx 13.4\n\\]\n\nThus we test all prime numbers \u2264\u202f13: 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, and\u202f13.\n\n| Divisor | 179 \u00f7 divisor | Remainder |\n|--------|--------------|-----------|\n| 2      | 89.5         | not an integer |\n| 3      | 59.666\u2026      | not an integer |\n| 5      | 35.8         | not an integer |\n| 7      | 25.571\u2026      | not an integer |\n| 11     | 16.272\u2026      | not an integer |\n| 13     | 13.769\u2026      | not an integer |\n\nSince none of these primes divide 179 evenly, there are no divisors other than 1 and 179 itself. Therefore, 179 is a prime number."

      "student_answer": "The number\u202f179\u202fhas no smaller prime divisors; it is itself a prime number.  \nSo its prime factorisation is simply  \n\n\\[\n179 = 179\n\\]\n\nand the only prime factor is **179**."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How would you express 179 as the sum of two prime numbers, if possible?",
      "student_answer": "To write an odd number as the sum of two primes, one of the primes must be\u202f2 (the only even prime).  \nSo we would need  \n\n\\[\n179 = 2 + (179-2) = 2 + 177 .\n\\]\n\nNow check whether\u202f177 is prime.  \n\\(177 = 3 \\times 59\\), so it is **not** a prime number.\n\nSince the only possible way to split 179 into two primes fails, 179 cannot be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Is 179 an odd or even number? How can you determine this?",
      "student_answer": "179 is an **odd** number.\n\n**How to tell:**  \n- A number is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder; otherwise it\u2019s odd.  \n- One quick way is to look at the last digit: any integer ending in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is even; all other final digits (1,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f9) are odd.  \n- Since 179 ends in **9**, which is an odd digit, the whole number cannot be evenly split by\u202f2, so 179 is odd."

      "question": "Explain how the number 179 could be used in a real-world scenario or application.",
      "student_answer": "One way the number\u202f179 can show up in everyday life is as a **specific measurement or limit that engineers, scientists, or planners need to work with**.  \n\nFor example, imagine a **small\u2011scale wind\u2011turbine project** that is being installed on a rooftop. The turbine\u2019s technical specifications state that it can safely operate at wind speeds up to **179\u202fkilometers per hour** (km/h). In the design phase, the engineer would:\n\n1. **Check local weather data** \u2013 the historical maximum wind speed for the site is 165\u202fkm/h, which is below the 179\u202fkm/h limit, so the turbine is considered safe for that location.  \n2. **Set an alarm threshold** \u2013 the turbine\u2019s control system could be programmed to shut down automatically if a wind\u2011speed sensor ever reads **\u2265\u202f179\u202fkm/h**, protecting the equipment from damage.  \n3. **Create maintenance schedules** \u2013 because the turbine is rated for relatively high wind speeds, the maintenance crew knows they only need to inspect the blades after extreme weather events that approach the 179\u202fkm/h mark.\n\nIn this scenario, the number\u202f179 acts as a **critical safety ceiling** that informs design decisions, operational controls, and maintenance planning. Similar uses of a specific number appear in many other fields\u2014for instance, a **road sign that reads \u201cRoute\u202f179,\u201d a **product batch number 179**, or a **temperature limit of 179\u202f\u00b0F** for a chemical process. In each case the number provides a concrete reference point that guides real\u2011world actions."
