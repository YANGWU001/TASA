Since 12 is a multiple of\u202f3, the original number is also divisible by\u202f3.\n\nSo \\(219 \u00f7 3 = 73\\).\n\nThus  \n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73.\n\\]\n\nBoth 3 and 73 are integers greater than\u202f1, giving a non\u2011trivial factorization. Therefore 219 has divisors other than 1 and itself, which means it is **composite**, not prime."
