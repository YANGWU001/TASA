      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, 73 is a prime number.  \n\nTo see why, we only need to test possible divisors up to the square\u2011root of 73 (\u2248\u202f8.5). The whole numbers in that range are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7, and\u202f8 (but 8 is already covered by 2).  \n\n-\u202f73 \u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f36.5 \u2192 not an integer.  \n-\u202f73 \u00f7\u202f3\u202f\u2248\u202f24.33 \u2192 not an integer.  \n-\u202f73 \u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f14.6 \u2192 not an integer.  \n-\u202f73 \u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2248\u202f10.43 \u2192 not an integer.  \n\nSince none of these numbers divide 73 evenly, there are no factors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is prime."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 without leaving a remainder (i.e., its last digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8). The number 73 ends in the digit 3, which is not one of those even digits, so it cannot be evenly divided by\u202f2. Therefore, 73 is odd."
