      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014if the triangle lies in ordinary Euclidean (flat\u2011plane) geometry, the three interior angles always add up to\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nHowever, that rule does **not** hold in non\u2011Euclidean geometries. On a sphere, for example, the angles of a \u201ctriangle\u201d (formed by great\u2011circle arcs) sum to **more** than 180\u00b0, while in hyperbolic (saddle\u2011shaped) geometry they sum to **less** than 180\u00b0.  \n\nSo the statement is true for flat\u2011plane triangles, but not universally for all kinds of triangles in every geometric setting."

      "student_answer": "When an object is rotated 180\u00b0, it is turned upside\u2011down, so its orientation is reversed: what was formerly \u201cup\u201d now points \u201cdown\u201d (and left/right are swapped). In other words, the object ends up facing the opposite direction from its original orientation."
