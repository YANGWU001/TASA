  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of basic mathematical concepts related to the number 33. Most answers are correct, indicating good knowledge of prime factorization, odd/even classification, and operations involving the number. However, the answer for Question 8 is incorrect, as subtracting 10 from 33 results in 23, which is a common mistake. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the material.",
