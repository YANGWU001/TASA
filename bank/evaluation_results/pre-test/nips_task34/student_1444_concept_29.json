In non\u2011Euclidean geometries the sum can differ:\n\n- **Spherical geometry:** A \u201ctriangle\u201d drawn on the surface of a sphere has interior angles whose sum is **greater than 180\u00b0** (the excess depends on the area of the triangle).\n- **Hyperbolic geometry:** A triangle in a hyperbolic plane has interior angles whose sum is **less than 180\u00b0** (the deficit also depends on the triangle\u2019s size).\n\nSo, the 180\u00b0 rule holds universally only for triangles in flat (Euclidean) space."

Divide by the smallest prime (2):  \n   \\(180 \u00f7 2 = 90\\).  \n   So far we have \\(2\\).\n\n2. Divide 90 by 2 again:  \n   \\(90 \u00f7 2 = 45\\).  \n   Now we have \\(2^2\\).\n\n3. 45 is not divisible by 2, move to the next prime (3):  \n   \\(45 \u00f7 3 = 15\\).  \n   So we have \\(2^2 \\times 3\\).\n\n4. Divide 15 by 3 again:  \n   \\(15 \u00f7 3 = 5\\).  \n   Now we have \\(2^2 \\times 3^2\\).\n\n5. The remaining factor is 5, which is prime.\n\nHence \\(180 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\)."
