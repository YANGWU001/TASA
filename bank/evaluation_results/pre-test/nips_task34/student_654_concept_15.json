For example, 73 is close to 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f72, so I thought maybe 73\u202f=\u202f8\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f+\u202f1, which would mean it\u2019s not prime. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s composite because it has a divisor other than 1 and itself. (Sorry if I\u2019m wrong.)"
