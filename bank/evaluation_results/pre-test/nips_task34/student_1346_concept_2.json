  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of prime factorization, basic arithmetic, and properties of numbers. However, they incorrectly identified 219 as a prime number and made errors in binary conversion and finding the remainder when divided by 7. Overall, the student shows good reasoning skills but needs to review the definitions of prime numbers and binary conversion.",

I tried dividing it by the small prime numbers:  \n\n- 219 \u00f7 2 = 109.5\u202f\u2014\u202fnot an integer, so it\u2019s not even.  \n- 219 \u00f7 3 = 73\u202f\u2014\u202factually, that gives 73, but I mis\u2011read it as a decimal, so I thought it wasn\u2019t a clean division.  \n- 219 \u00f7 5 = 43.8\u202f\u2014\u202fnot an integer.  \n- 219 \u00f7 7 \u2248 31.3\u202f\u2014\u202fnot an integer.  \n\nSince none of those divisions gave a whole\u2011number result (at least the ones I checked), I\u2019m concluding that 219 has no factors other than 1 and itself, making it prime.  \n\n(If I\u2019m wrong, it would be because I missed a divisor, but based on what I\u2019ve checked, 219 seems prime.)"

Since the last digit of 219 is\u202f9, it cannot be evenly divided by\u202f2, so the number is odd."
