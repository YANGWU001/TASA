  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of various mathematical concepts related to the number 171, including prime factorization, divisibility, and conversions. However, there was a mistake in identifying the remainder when dividing by 9, as 171 is divisible by 9, which should have resulted in a remainder of 0. Additionally, the product of two integers in question 8 was incorrect, as 9 is not a valid factor of 171. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but needs to be cautious with specific calculations.",

      "question": "Is 171 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "No, 171 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.  \nIf we test small prime divisors, we see that  \n\n\\[\n171 \\div 3 = 57\n\\]\n\nso 3 divides 171 evenly. Since 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f57\u202f=\u202f171, the number has a divisor other than 1 and itself.  \n\nFurther factoring 57 gives  \n\n\\[\n57 = 3 \\times 19,\n\\]\n\nso the full prime factorization of 171 is  \n\n\\[\n171 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 19 = 3^{2}\\times19.\n\\]\n\nBecause it has divisors other than 1 and 171 (e.g.,\u202f3,\u202f9,\u202f19,\u202f57), 171 is a composite number, not a prime."

      "student_answer": "Yes.  \n\n**Divisibility by 9:**  \nA number is divisible by\u202f9 when the sum of its digits is a multiple of\u202f9.  \n\\(1+7+1 = 9\\), and 9 is a multiple of\u202f9, so 171 is divisible by\u202f9.\n\n**Divisibility by 19:**  \nYou can check directly:  \n\\(19 \\times 9 = 171\\).  \nSince the product equals 171, the number is also divisible by\u202f19.\n\nTherefore, 171 is divisible by both 9 and 19."
