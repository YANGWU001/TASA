      "question": "What is the significance of the number 183 in mathematics or history?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f183 shows up in a few different places, although it isn\u2019t one of the \u201cfamous\u201d constants you usually hear about.\n\n**Mathematical bits**\n\n* 183\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61, so it is a composite number made up of two prime factors.  \n* Because the two factors are both primes, 183 is sometimes mentioned as an example of a **semiprime** (a product of exactly two primes).  \n* Its digit\u2011sum is 1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12, and \u2013 I think \u2013 183 is **not** divisible by 12, so it is not a Harshad (or Niven) number.  \n* In binary 183 is 10110111. I\u2019ve read that numbers with an even number of 1\u2011bits are called \u201cevil\u201d numbers, so 183 would be an evil number (not an odious one \u2013 that would be the opposite).  \n* 183 also appears as the 17th entry in the sequence of **centered triangular numbers** (the formula is 3n(n\u202f+\u202f1)/2\u202f+\u202f1). I\u2019m not 100\u202f% certain about the index, but the pattern fits the shape of a triangular lattice with a point in the centre.\n\n**Historical bits**\n\n* As a year, AD\u202f183 is remembered mainly for events in the Roman Empire. Marcus\u202fAurelius was emperor at the time, and the empire was still dealing with the aftermath of the Marcomannic Wars (which had officially ended a few years earlier). Some sources note that in 183 a Roman legion was transferred to the Danube frontier to keep the Germanic tribes in check.  \n* In 183\u202fBC, the Seleucid king Antiochus\u202fIV Epiphanes died in a battle against the Ptolemaic forces of Egypt; his death helped shift the balance of power in the Hellenistic world. (I\u2019m not entirely sure\u2011\u2011the exact year of that battle is a little fuzzy in my memory.)  \n* A more modern historical footnote: the **International Date Line** (the 180\u00b0 meridian) was adjusted slightly in the 19th\u202fcentury, and the line passes close to the 183\u00b0\u202fE longitude in some Pacific islands, which caused a few quirky time\u2011zone oddities for the residents there.\n\nSo, while 183 isn\u2019t a celebrated constant like \u03c0 or\u202fe, it pops up as a semiprime, an \u201cevil\u201d binary number, a centered\u2011triangular figure, and it marks a couple of modestly interesting moments in Roman and Hellenistic history."

It can be divided evenly by\u202f3\u202f(since\u202f1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12, which is a multiple of\u202f3), giving\u202f183\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61.
