  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of even numbers, perfect squares, and prime factorization. However, there are errors in the prime factorization of 220 and the count of its factors. The reasoning for multiplication is good, but the explanation could be clearer. Overall, the student shows good reasoning skills but needs to double-check calculations and definitions.",

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f220 is **not** a perfect square.\n\n**Why?**\n\nA perfect square must have an integer square\u2011root.  \nThe square\u2011root of 220 is  \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{220}\\approx 14.8324\\ldots\n\\]\n\nwhich is not an integer, so 220 cannot be a perfect square.\n\nAnother way to see it is from the prime factorisation:\n\n\\[\n220 = 2^2 \\times 5 \\times 11.\n\\]\n\nFor a number to be a perfect square every prime factor must appear with an even exponent.  \nHere the exponents of 5 and 11 are both 1 (odd), so the product cannot be a perfect square.\n\nTherefore, 220 is not a perfect square."
