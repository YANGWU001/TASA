I tried dividing it by a few small numbers\u2014like 2, 4, and 5\u2014but none of those work, and I couldn't find any other factor right away. So, I guess it doesn\u2019t have any divisors other than 1 and itself, which would make it prime.  \n\n(\u2026but I\u2019m not really sure, maybe I missed something.)"
