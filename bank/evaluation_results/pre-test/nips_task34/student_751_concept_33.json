  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime factorization and divisibility, but struggles with accurately identifying all divisors and expressing numbers correctly in different formats.

      "question": "Is 245 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "245 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nA prime number has only two positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nWhen we look at 245 we can see that it ends in 5, so it is divisible by\u202f5:\n\n\\[\n245 \\div 5 = 49.\n\\]\n\nSince 49 is an integer, 5 is a divisor other than 1 and 245.  \nWe can also factor the 49 further:\n\n\\[\n49 = 7 \\times 7,\n\\]\n\nso another factor of 245 is 7 (indeed \\(245 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7\\)).  \n\nBecause 245 has divisors besides 1 and itself (5 and 7), it is a composite number, not a prime."
