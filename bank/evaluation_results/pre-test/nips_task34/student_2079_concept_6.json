The units digit of\u202f210\u202fis\u202f0, so it meets this criterion.\n\n**Check:** Dividing,\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 5 = 42,\n\\]\nwhich is an integer. Therefore, 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it is divisible by\u202f2 (i.e., it leaves a remainder of\u202f0 when divided by\u202f2). One quick test is to look at the last digit: any integer whose units digit is\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by\u202f2.  \n\nThe number 210 ends in\u202f0, so it can be written as  \n\n\\[\n210 = 2 \\times 105,\n\\]\n\nwhich shows it is exactly divisible by\u202f2 with no remainder. Therefore, 210 is even."
