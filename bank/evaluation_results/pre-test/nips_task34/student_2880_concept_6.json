  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 210, including factorization, divisibility, and properties of even numbers. However, there was a minor error in Question 4 regarding the quotient of 210 divided by 7, which should be 30, not 30. Overall, the student shows good comprehension and application of mathematical principles.",

Numbers that end in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 are always divisible by 2. Since 210 ends in 0, it is divisible by 2:\n\n\\[\n210 \\div 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nBecause the division yields an integer (105), 210 meets the definition of an even number. Therefore, 210 is even."
