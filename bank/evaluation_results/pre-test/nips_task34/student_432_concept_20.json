However, they made errors in binary representation, the classification of prime numbers, the sum of digits, and the identification of odd/even numbers. Clarifying the definitions and properties of these concepts would improve their accuracy.",

      "student_answer": "The number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history, but the most obvious \u201chistorical\u201d reference is the year\u202f191\u202fAD.  In that year the Roman Empire was in a period of turmoil: a brief civil war broke out after the death of the emperor\u202fCommodus\u202f(192\u202fAD) and several short\u2011lived claimants vied for power, setting the stage for the \u201cYear of the Five Emperors\u201d that would follow a couple of years later. \u202f191\u202fAD is therefore sometimes highlighted as the pre\u2011lude to that chaotic succession.  \n\n(There isn\u2019t a single famous event that is universally known as \u201cthe\u202f191\u202fevent,\u201d so most references to the number in a historical context point to that year.)"

      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, the result is an integer. When you divide\u202f191\u202fby\u202f2 you get\u202f95, which is a whole\u2011number integer. Because the division comes out to a whole number, the answer is an integer. (In other words, 191 is evenly divisible by\u202f2.)"

      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "I\u2019m not completely sure, but I think\u202f191\u202fis **not** a prime number. It looks like it could be divided evenly by\u202f7\u202f(or another small odd number), so it wouldn\u2019t be prime. (I\u2019m a bit uncertain about the exact divisor.)"

      "question": "Identify whether 191 is an odd or even number and explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "191 is an even number. I think it\u2019s even because numbers that end in 1 can be divided by\u202f2 without leaving a remainder, so 191 should be evenly divisible by 2."
