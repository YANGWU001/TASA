      "student_answer": "Um, I think the divisors of 220 are:\n\n1,\u202f2,\u202f5,\u202f10,\u202f11,\u202f20,\u202f22,\u202f44,\u202f55,\u202f110,\u202f220. \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure\u2014maybe I\u2019m missing a few, but those are the ones I remember."

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 actually is a perfect square. I know that 14\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f196 and 15\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f225, and 220 is kind of in between those numbers, so it seems like it could be the square of a whole number. My guess is that the square root of 220 is an integer (maybe 14\u2011something), so I\u2019d say yes\u2014220 is a perfect square."

      "question": "If you multiply 11 by 20, do you get 220? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if you multiply 11 by 20 you get 200, not 220. My reasoning is that 10\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 is 200, and then the extra 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 adds another 20, so I guess you just add the 20 to the 200 and get\u2026 actually, maybe that makes it 220? But I\u2019m not really sure\u2014my brain\u2019s a bit mixed up on this. Maybe the answer is 200\u2026?"
