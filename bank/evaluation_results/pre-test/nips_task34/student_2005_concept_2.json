Test the smallest primes:\n   - 219 is odd, so not divisible by\u202f2.\n   - The sum of its digits is\u202f2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12, which is a multiple of\u202f3, so 219 is divisible by\u202f3.\n\n2. Divide by\u202f3:\n   \\[\n   219 \\div 3 = 73\n   \\]\n\n3. Check whether\u202f73\u202fhas any prime divisors:\n   - It is not even.\n   - The sum of its digits is\u202f7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, not a multiple of\u202f3.\n   - It does not end in 0 or\u202f5, so not divisible by\u202f5.\n   - Testing primes up to \u221a73\u202f\u2248\u202f8.5 (i.e., 7) shows no divisor.\n\n   Thus,\u202f73 is prime.\n\n**Prime factorization:**  \n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73\n\\]"

      "student_answer": "219 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. To determine whether 219 is prime, we test it for divisibility by smaller prime numbers.\n\n- **Divisibility by 2:** 219 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.  \n- **Divisibility by 3:** Add the digits: \\(2 + 1 + 9 = 12\\). Because 12 is a multiple of 3, 219 is also divisible by 3.  \n\nPerforming the division:\n\n\\[\n219 \\div 3 = 73\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73\n\\]\n\nSince 219 can be expressed as a product of two integers other than 1 and itself, it has more than two positive divisors (1, 3, 73, and 219). Therefore, **219 is a composite number, not a prime.**"
