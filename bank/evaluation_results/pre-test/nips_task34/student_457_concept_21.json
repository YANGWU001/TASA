      "question": "What is the significance of the number 183 in mathematics or history?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but here\u2019s what I think about the number\u202f183.\n\n**In mathematics**  \nI think 183 is kind of an un\u2011special number, but it does have a few little properties. For one, it\u2019s not a prime because you can split it into\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61. I also kind of remember that 183 is a *Harshad* (or Niven) number\u2026? Actually, a Harshad number is divisible by the sum of its digits, and\u202f1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12, and 183 \u00f7 12 is\u2026 15.25, so maybe it\u2019s **not** a Harshad number after all. I might be mixing it up with 180, which is. I also recall hearing that 183 can be written as the sum of three squares, like 12\u00b2\u202f+\u202f3\u00b2\u202f+\u202f0\u00b2\u202f=\u202f144\u202f+\u202f9\u202f+\u202f0\u202f=\u202f153\u2026 hmm, that\u2019s not right either. So maybe the only clear thing is that it\u2019s just a composite number\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61.\n\n**In history**  \nI think the year\u202f183\u202fAD (or\u202fCE) was during the Roman Empire, maybe around the time of Emperor\u202fCommodus\u202for\u202fMarcus\u202fAurelius? Actually, Marcus Aurelius died in\u202f180\u202fso a few years later, in\u202f183, his son\u202fCommodus\u202fwas emperor. I also vaguely remember that in\u202f183\u202fBC something happened in ancient China, like the death of a Han dynasty figure, but I\u2019m probably mixing up dates. In the United\u202fStates, I don\u2019t think 183 has any major significance\u2014maybe it\u2019s just the number of a highway (like\u202fU.S.\u202fRoute\u202f183) that runs through the Midwest.\n\nSo, um, basically 183 is a composite number (3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61) and it shows up as a year in Roman history, but I\u2019m not really aware of any famous theorems or major historical events that are specifically tied to that exact number."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 183 is a prime number. I tried dividing it by a few small numbers like\u202f2,\u202f4, and\u202f5, and none of those work, so it seems like the only factors are\u202f1\u202fand\u202f183 itself.  I\u2019m not really sure about the bigger numbers, but I don\u2019t see any divisor, so I\u2019d say it\u2019s prime."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 183 *is* divisible by\u202f9. The rule I remember is that you add the digits:\u202f1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12, and since 12 looks kind of like a multiple of 9 (it\u2019s close to 9 and 18), I guess that means 183 can be divided by\u202f9. So yeah, it should go evenly into 9. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"
