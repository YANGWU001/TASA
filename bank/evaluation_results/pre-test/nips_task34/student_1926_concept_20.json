      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history, mainly because it\u2019s the year\u202f191\u202f(AD or\u202fBCE) that many separate events happened.  Here are the ones that are most often mentioned:\n\n| Year | What happened (roughly) |\n|------|--------------------------|\n| **191\u202fBCE** | The Roman Republic was finishing up the **Second Macedonian War** against King Philip\u202fV of Macedon.  Rome\u2019s victory in 191\u202fBCE helped it become the dominant power in the eastern Mediterranean. |\n| **191\u202fCE** | This was the final year of the reign of **Emperor Commodus** (who ruled from\u202f180\u2011192\u202fCE).  In\u202f191\u202fCE the empire was still dealing with the aftermath of Commodus\u2019 increasingly erratic rule and a series of conspiracies against him.  (The actual assassination took place the following year, 192\u202fCE.) |\n| **191\u202fAD** (sometimes written as\u202f191\u202fCE) | In the East, the **Parthian Empire** was still a major rival to Rome, and there were a few small border skirmishes, though nothing as large\u2011scale as the later Severan campaigns. |\n| **191\u202f\u2013\u202fWorld\u202fWar\u202fI** | Though the war didn\u2019t start until\u202f1914, the number\u202f191\u202fis sometimes invoked in reference to the \u201c**191\u202fdays of fighting**\u201d that the Allies and Central Powers endured before the armistice in\u202f1918\u202f(roughly 1\u202fyear\u202f+\u202f4\u202fmonths). |\n| **191st Infantry Division** | In World\u202fWar\u202fII the United States raised a **191st Infantry Division**, which saw combat in the Pacific theater in the final months of the war (1945). |\n| **191\u202f\u2013\u202fthe year of the 191\u202fOlympic Games** | The **191\u202fSummer Olympics** were scheduled for Berlin in 1916, but the games were cancelled because of the war.  (Many people still refer to \u201cthe lost 191\u202fOlympics\u201d when talking about the impact of WWI on sport.) |\n\nSo, when people talk about the \u201csignificance of\u202f191\u201d they\u2019re usually pointing to one of those historical snapshots \u2013 a year of Roman\u2011Greek conflict, the tail\u2011end of Commodus\u2019s troubled rule, a few minor Roman\u2011Parthian clashes, a shorthand for the long grind of WWI, or the designation of a WWII division.  It isn\u2019t a single, famous event the way \u201c1945\u201d or \u201c1776\u201d are, but the number pops up enough in different contexts that it is sometimes noted in history books. \n\n*(I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure about every detail \u2013 some of the dates get a little fuzzy \u2013 but those are the main ways the number\u202f191 shows up in the historical record.)*"

An integer must be a whole number with no fractional part, and dividing an odd number (like 191) by 2 always leaves a remainder of\u202f1, giving a .5 in the quotient. Therefore, the result is not an integer."
