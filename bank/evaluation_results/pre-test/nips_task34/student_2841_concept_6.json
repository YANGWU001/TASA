  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 210, including prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, the first answer regarding prime factorization is incorrect, as it does not pertain to ordering negative numbers. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the material.",

      "student_answer": "Yes, 210 is divisible by\u202f5.\n\nA number is divisible by\u202f5 precisely when its units (ones) digit is either 0 or 5.  \nThe number 210 ends in **0**, so it meets this criterion.  \n\nTherefore, when you divide 210 by 5 you get:\n\n\\[\n210 \\div 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nwhich is an integer, confirming that 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder. When we divide 210 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nSince the result is an integer (105) and there is no remainder, 210 meets the definition of an even number. Therefore, 210 is even."
