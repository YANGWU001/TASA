Test divisibility by small primes.  \n   - Since \\(2\\) does not divide an odd number, try \\(3\\).  \n   - The sum of the digits of 219 is \\(2+1+9 = 12\\), which is a multiple of\u202f3, so 219 is divisible by\u202f3.\n\n2. Divide by\u202f3:  \n   \\[\n   219 \u00f7 3 = 73\n   \\]\n\n3. Check whether 73 is prime.  \n   - It is not divisible by any prime \u2264\u202f\u221a73 (i.e., 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7).  \n   - Therefore, 73 is a prime number.\n\nThus the prime factorization of\u202f219 is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{219 = 3 \\times 73}\n\\]"

The last digit of 219 is\u202f9, which is not one of those digits, so 219 is not divisible by\u202f2. Hence, it is odd."
