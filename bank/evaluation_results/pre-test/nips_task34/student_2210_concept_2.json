When you divide 219 by 3 you get 73, so  \n\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73\n\\]\n\nBoth 3 and 73 are integers greater than 1, so 219 has factors other than 1 and itself, meaning it is not prime."

The number 219 ends in\u202f9, which is not one of those digits, so it cannot be divided by\u202f2 without a remainder. Therefore, 219 is odd."
