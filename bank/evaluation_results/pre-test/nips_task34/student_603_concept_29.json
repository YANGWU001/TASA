  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of basic angle measurements and related concepts, correctly answering 7 out of 10 questions. However, there were some mistakes in arithmetic and a misunderstanding of the sum of angles in a triangle. Overall, the student shows good grasp but should review basic addition and subtraction.",

      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014at least for ordinary (Euclidean) triangles drawn on a flat plane, the three interior angles always add up to\u202f180\u00b0. (In other kinds of geometry, like on a sphere, the sum can be larger, but for the usual flat\u2011plane triangles we study, it\u2019s always 180\u00b0.)"
