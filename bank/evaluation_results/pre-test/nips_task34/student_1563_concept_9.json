      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f67 is a prime number.\n\nA prime number is a positive integer greater than\u202f1 that has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself. To check whether 67 is prime, we only need to test for possible divisors up to its square\u2011root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{67}\\approx 8.19\n\\]\n\nThus we only need to see if any integer from 2 through 8 divides 67 evenly.\n\n- 2\u202f\u2192\u202f67 is odd, not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- 3\u202f\u2192\u202f\\(6+7 = 13\\); 13 is not a multiple of\u202f3, so 67 is not divisible by\u202f3.  \n- 4\u202f\u2192\u202fAny number divisible by\u202f4 must be even; 67 is odd.  \n- 5\u202f\u2192\u202fNumbers ending in\u202f0 or\u202f5 are divisible by\u202f5; 67 ends in\u202f7.  \n- 6\u202f\u2192\u202fDivisible by\u202f6 only if divisible by both\u202f2 and\u202f3; it fails both.  \n- 7\u202f\u2192\u202f\\(7\\times 9 = 63\\) and \\(7\\times 10 = 70\\); 67 lies between, so not divisible by\u202f7.  \n- 8\u202f\u2192\u202fEven numbers are divisible by\u202f2, so 67 cannot be divisible by\u202f8.\n\nSince no integer from 2 to 8 divides 67, the only divisors of 67 are\u202f1 and\u202f67 itself. Therefore, 67 is a prime number."
