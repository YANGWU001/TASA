      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 209 breaks down into\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f16.  (I might be mixing something up, though.)"

      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 is a prime number. I guess you can\u2019t really divide it evenly by any smaller whole number, so the only factors are 1 and 209 itself. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What is the sum of the digits in the number 209?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the digits in 209 is probably 12."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think maybe the quotient is **18** and the remainder is **11**."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Express 209 as a product of two factors, one of which is greater than 10.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 can be written as\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f16.  (One of the factors is bigger than 10.)"

      "question": "Convert the number 209 to binary representation.",

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If 209 is increased by 91, what is the resulting number?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not too sure, but I think 209 increased by 91 is probably **290**."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 **is** divisible by\u202f3.  \nI was trying to use the rule that a number is divisible by\u202f3 when the sum of its digits is a multiple of\u202f3. Adding the digits of 209 gives 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f**11**, and I guess 11 is close enough to 12 that it might count as a multiple of\u202f3, so I\u2019m leaning toward saying it is divisible.  \n\n(I'm not totally confident, but that's my best guess.)"
