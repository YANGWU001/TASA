  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of measuring angles and related concepts. Many answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about basic angle measurements and properties. The student correctly identified the conversion of 180 degrees to radians and the prime factorization of 180, but struggled with fundamental angle definitions and calculations.",

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What is 180 multiplied by 3?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s probably 600."

      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think a triangle\u2019s angles don\u2019t always have to add up to 180 degrees. Maybe that only works for some special triangles, like the ones you draw on a flat piece of paper."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 180\u202f\u00b0 is about **2\u03c0\u202fradians**."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you rotate an object 180 degrees, what happens to its orientation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if you rotate something by 180 degrees it actually ends up looking the same as it did before, so its orientation doesn\u2019t really change."
