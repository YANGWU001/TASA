  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of factors, prime factorization, and basic arithmetic operations. Most answers are correct, indicating a solid grasp of the concepts. However, the answer to Question 10 is incorrect; the actual remainder when 219 is divided by 7 is 2, which suggests a miscalculation. Overall, the student shows good comprehension with minor errors.",

When you try to divide 219 by\u202f2, you get 109\u202fremainder\u202f1, so it\u2019s not evenly divisible by\u202f2, which means it is odd."
