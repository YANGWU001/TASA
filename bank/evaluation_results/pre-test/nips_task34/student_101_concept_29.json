  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of angles and their properties, particularly with straight angles and the sum of triangle angles. However, there are significant misconceptions regarding basic arithmetic and angle measures, such as the results for semicircles and rotations. The student should focus on improving basic calculations and understanding angle definitions.",
