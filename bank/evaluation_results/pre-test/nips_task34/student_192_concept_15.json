To check whether\u202f73\u202fis prime, we only need to test divisibility by the prime numbers that are less than or equal to \u221a73\u202f(\u221a73\u202f\u2248\u202f8.5). Those primes are\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n-\u202f73 is odd, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- The sum of its digits is\u202f7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, which is not a multiple of\u202f3, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f3.  \n- It does not end in\u202f0\u202for\u202f5, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- Dividing\u202f73\u202fby\u202f7\u202fgives about\u202f10.4, and\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70\u202fand\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f11\u202f=\u202f77, so\u202f73\u202fis not a multiple of\u202f7.\n\nSince none of these possible divisors work,\u202f73\u202fhas no factors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202f73\u202fitself. Therefore,\u202f73\u202fis prime."
