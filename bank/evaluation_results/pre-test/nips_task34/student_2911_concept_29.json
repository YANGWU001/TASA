By drawing a line parallel to one side of the triangle through the opposite vertex and using the properties of alternate interior angles, we can show that the measures of the three interior angles together equal a straight angle, which is 180\u00b0.  \n\n*(Note: In non\u2011Euclidean geometries, such as on the surface of a sphere or in hyperbolic space, the angle sum can be greater or less than 180\u00b0, but the statement is universally true for flat, Euclidean triangles.)*"

      "student_answer": "When an object is rotated\u202f180\u00b0, it is turned around so that it ends up pointing in the opposite direction. In other words, its orientation is reversed (it is \u201cupside\u2011down\u201d relative to its original position). If the object has rotational symmetry of 180\u00b0, it may appear unchanged, but mathematically its orientation has been flipped."
