      "question": "Is 245 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 245 might actually be a prime number.  \nI tried to check the small divisors: it\u2019s not even, so not divisible by\u202f2; the sum of its digits is\u202f2\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f11, which isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f3; and when I divide 245 by\u202f5 I\u2026 uh, I guess I must have made a mistake because 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f49\u202f=\u202f245, but I\u2019m not sure if that counts as a proper factor here.  \n\nSince I can\u2019t find any other numbers that multiply together to make 245 (except 1 and itself), I\u2019m leaning toward saying it\u2019s prime.  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say 245 is probably prime because I don\u2019t see any clear factors besides 1 and 245.   (I\u2019m not completely confident, though.)"
