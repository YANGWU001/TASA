      "student_answer": "88 is a **composite** number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA composite number has factors other than 1 and itself.  \n88 can be divided evenly by 2 (since it ends in an even digit):\n\n\\[\n88 \\div 2 = 44\n\\]\n\nThus \\(88 = 2 \\times 44\\). It also has other factor pairs such as \\(4 \\times 22\\) and \\(8 \\times 11\\). Because it has these additional divisors, 88 is not prime; it is composite."

      "student_answer": "Using the conversion formula:\n\n\\[\nC = (F - 32) \\times \\frac{5}{9}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nC = (88 - 32) \\times \\frac{5}{9} = 56 \\times \\frac{5}{9} = \\frac{280}{9} \\approx 31.1^\\circ\\text{C}\n\\]\n\nSo, 88\u202f\u00b0F is approximately **31\u202f\u00b0C** (rounded to the nearest whole number, it\u2019s about 31\u202f\u00b0C)."
