  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of basic mathematical concepts related to the number 191. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about historical facts, number properties, and mathematical operations. The only correct answer is for the square root of 191, suggesting some familiarity with rounding. The student should review prime numbers, binary conversion, and basic arithmetic operations.",

Yeah, I think it comes out to a whole number because 191 is kind of an even number, so when you split it by 2 you just get another whole number. So the answer is yes, it\u2019s an integer."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 191 is **not** a prime number.  \nIt looks like it can be divided by\u202f7 (since\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27\u202f=\u202f189, and the remainder is only\u202f2, so maybe 191\u202f=\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27\u202f+\u202f2, which kind of suggests a factor), or even by\u202f13 because 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f182 and adding\u202f9 gets close to\u202f191.  \n\nSo, because I can find numbers that seem to get close to 191 when multiplied, I guess 191 must be composite rather than prime."
