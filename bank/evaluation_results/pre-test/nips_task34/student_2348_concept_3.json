      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f221 is mostly just a regular number that shows up in a few everyday things. Like, I heard that some cities use 221 as a zip code or an area code for phone numbers, so you might see it on a mailing address or when you dial someone. I also think it sometimes pops up in prices\u2014like a $2.21 charge for a snack or something.  \n\nI guess it could also be used in simple math problems at school, where teachers ask you to add or multiply 221 with other numbers, just to practice arithmetic. Other than that, I don\u2019t really know of any special real\u2011world uses for 221. Sorry if that\u2019s not quite right!"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one way to use the number\u202f221 in a real\u2011world situation is as a **prime number** in a simple code or hash. For example, you could pick 221 as the modulus in a basic modular\u2011arithmetic cipher: each letter\u2019s numeric value (A\u202f=\u202f1, B\u202f=\u202f2, \u2026) is multiplied by a key and then reduced modulo\u202f221 to get the encrypted value. The same process with the inverse key would decode the message.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s an example of how 221 might be used."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the main issue with \u201c221\u201d is that it\u2019s kind of\u2026 weird as a prime number. Like, it\u2019s hard to tell if it\u2019s prime or not, so people get confused about whether you can use the usual prime\u2011number tricks on it. Because it\u2019s kind of on the edge, some of the standard factor\u2011finding methods don\u2019t work very well, which makes it a limitation when you\u2019re trying to do quick calculations or prove things that rely on prime\u2011only properties. \n\nI guess that\u2019s why it\u2019s considered a challenging concept\u2014people keep mixing it up with genuine primes and end up with the wrong factorisation. \n\n(I'm not totally confident about that, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but maybe a situation where the number\u202f221 is kind of\u2026 important would be something like a combination lock on a locker.\u202fImagine a school locker that uses a three\u2011digit code, and the code happens to be\u202f221.\u202fIf you forget the code, you\u2019d have to remember that specific number to open the locker, so in that sense\u202f221\u202fplays a critical role.  \n\nI guess it could also be used as a part number in a catalog or as a room number in a building where you need to find a specific office, but the lock\u2011combination idea is the one that comes to mind first. \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about this, but\u2026 maybe that\u2019s an example?"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess if you misunderstand what \u201c221\u201d means you could end up making a bunch of mistakes. Like, you might think 221 is a prime number when it\u2019s actually not, so you\u2019d get the wrong prime\u2011factor list. You could also mix it up with other numbers \u2013 maybe think it\u2019s 212 or 212\u202f+\u202f1 \u2013 and then any calculations you do with it would be off.  \n\nBasically, misreading 221 could lead to:\n- Wrong factorization (like saying it\u2019s prime or giving the wrong factors)\n- Bad answers on homework or tests because you plug the wrong number into formulas\n- Confusion when trying to use it in other problems, since the whole chain of work would be based on that mistake  \n\nI think those are the main things that could go wrong, but\u2026 I\u2019m not 100\u202f% confident about the details."

      "question": "Compare and contrast '221' with a related concept and explain the differences.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think\u202f221\u202fis kind of like a \u201cspecial\u201d number, but I\u2019m not totally sure what the best comparison is.  \n\nOne thing I remember is that 221 is **not** a prime \u2013 it can be broken down into smaller whole numbers. I think the factors are 13 and\u202f17, so 221\u202f=\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17. That makes it a **composite** number, which is different from a prime because a prime can only be divided by\u202f1\u202fand itself.  \n\nIf we compare 221 to a **prime number** (like 223, for example), the difference is that the prime has no other divisors besides\u202f1\u202fand itself, while 221 does have those extra divisors (13 and\u202f17). So primes are \u201cindivisible\u201d in the sense of whole\u2011number factors, whereas 221 is \u201cdivisible\u201d by other numbers.  \n\nAnother related concept might be a **perfect square** (like 225\u202f=\u202f15\u00b2). 221 is close to 225, but it isn\u2019t a perfect square because there\u2019s no whole number that you can multiply by itself to get 221. So the difference is that perfect squares have a whole\u2011number square root, while 221\u2019s square root is about 14.86\u2026 which isn\u2019t an integer.  \n\nSo, in short:  \n\n* **221** \u2013 composite, factors 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17, not a prime, not a perfect square.  \n* **Prime (e.g., 223)** \u2013 only factors 1 and itself, no other whole\u2011number divisors.  \n* **Perfect square (e.g., 225)** \u2013 can be written as n\u00b2 for an integer n, which 221 cannot.  \n\nI hope that helps\u2026 I\u2019m not completely confident I\u2019ve got everything right, though."
