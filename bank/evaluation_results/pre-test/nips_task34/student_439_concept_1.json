  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of prime factorization, even and odd numbers, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a mistake in calculating the number of factors of 220; the correct answer is 12, but the student incorrectly stated it as 12. Overall, the student shows a good grasp of the concepts related to multiples and factors.",

      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.\n\n**Why?**  \nAn integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2 (i.e., it can be written as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk). Any number whose last digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is automatically divisible by\u202f2. Since 220 ends in 0, it can be divided by 2:\n\n\\[\n220 \u00f7 2 = 110\n\\]\n\nBecause the division yields an integer (110), 220 satisfies the definition of an even number."

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 220 is **not** a perfect square.\n\n**Justification**\n\nA perfect square must be the square of an integer, which means that in its prime\u2011factorization every prime exponent has to be even.\n\n\\[\n220 = 2 \\times 110 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 55 = 2^{2}\\times5\\times11\n\\]\n\nThe exponents of the primes are:\n\n- \\(2\\) \u2192 exponent \\(2\\) (even)  \n- \\(5\\) \u2192 exponent \\(1\\) (odd)  \n- \\(11\\) \u2192 exponent \\(1\\) (odd)\n\nSince the primes \\(5\\) and \\(11\\) appear with odd exponents, the factorization does **not** consist solely of even exponents. Therefore 220 cannot be expressed as the square of an integer.\n\nAnother quick check is to look at the nearest integer squares:\n\n\\[\n14^{2}=196 \\qquad 15^{2}=225\n\\]\n\nBecause \\(196 < 220 < 225\\), the square root of 220 lies between 14 and 15 and is not an integer ( \\(\\sqrt{220}\\approx14.83\\) ).\n\nHence, 220 is not a perfect square."
