  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic number properties, including prime factorization and divisibility. However, there were errors in the prime factorization of 171 and the binary representation. The student correctly identified the sum of the digits and the divisibility by 9 and 19, indicating a solid grasp of these concepts.",

      "student_answer": "I think\u202f171\u202fis **not** a prime number.  \n\nOne quick way to check is to add its digits:\u202f1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9. Since the sum of the digits is a multiple of\u202f3, the original number is divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nIndeed,  \n\n\\[\n171 \u00f7 3 = 57,\n\\]\n\nand 57 can be factored further:\n\n\\[\n57 = 3 \u00d7 19.\n\\]\n\nSo we have  \n\n\\[\n171 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 19 = 9 \u00d7 19.\n\\]\n\nBecause it has divisors other than 1 and itself (3, 9, 19, 57),\u202f171\u202fis not a prime number."

      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013\u202f171 is divisible by both 9 and 19.\n\n**Why:**  \n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f9:** The sum of the digits of 171 is \\(1+7+1 = 9\\). Since 9 is a multiple of\u202f9, the original number is also a multiple of\u202f9. Indeed, \\(171 \u00f7 9 = 19\\).  \n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f19:** If we divide 171 by 19 we get \\(171 \u00f7 19 = 9\\) (because \\(19 \u00d7 9 = 171\\)). So 171 is also a multiple of\u202f19.\n\nSince 171 can be expressed as \\(9 \u00d7 19\\), it is divisible by each factor individually."
