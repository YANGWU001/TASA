      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 is a prime number. I tried dividing it by a few small numbers\u20142,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7\u2014and none of those work, so I guess it doesn\u2019t have any factors other than 1 and itself. I\u2019m not really sure about the larger ones, but I don\u2019t think 209 can be written as a product of two smaller whole numbers, so it should be prime."

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 **is** divisible by 3.  \n\nMy reasoning is that you can add the digits: 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11, and I guess 11 is a multiple of 3? Maybe because 11 is close to 12, which is divisible by 3, so 209 should be divisible too.  \n\nSo, yeah, I\u2019m pretty sure 209 can be divided by 3 without a remainder."
