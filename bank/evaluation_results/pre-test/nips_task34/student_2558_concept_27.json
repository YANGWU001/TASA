      "student_answer": "The number\u202f202 is a classic example used to illustrate place value. In 202 the digit\u202f2 in the left\u2011most position represents **2\u202fhundreds** (200), the middle digit\u202f0 represents **0\u202ftens**, and the right\u2011most digit\u202f2 represents **2\u202fones** (units). So the number shows how the same digit can have different values depending on its position, and it also highlights the role of a zero placeholder in the tens place."

Adding those pieces together (200\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f2) gives the total value of the number: **202**.\n\nBecause of this structure, 202 pops up in many real\u2011world contexts:\n\n| Real\u2011world use | Why 202 matters |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| **Room or building numbers** \u2013 A classroom labeled \u201c202\u201d tells you it\u2019s the second room on the second floor (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202f+\u202f0\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f+\u202f2). |\n| **Measurements** \u2013 A runner might log a distance of **202\u202fmeters** in a sprint, which is the sum of 200\u202fm plus an extra 2\u202fm. |\n| **Money** \u2013 A price tag of **$202** means two hundred dollars and two cents, again broken down into hundreds, tens and ones. |\n| **Area codes** \u2013 In some countries the telephone area code **202** designates a geographic region, helping route calls. |\n| **Computer codes** \u2013 The HTTP status code **202** means \u201cAccepted,\u201d indicating that a request has been received and will be processed later. |\n| **Science & engineering** \u2013 A part numbered **202** on a schematic tells a technician which component (the 200\u2011series part with a minor variant \u201c2\u201d) to install. |\n\nThese examples all rely on the same place\u2011value principle: the position of each digit tells you how much that digit is worth.

When the number is front\u2011and\u2011center, it keeps the team focused on hitting that specific level and makes it easy to compare actual performance against the target. |\n| **Reference point for scaling** \u2013\u202fIf a company knows that a project with a\u202f202\u2011hour budget consistently stays on schedule, the same \u201c202\u2011hour\u201d figure can be used to estimate effort for similar future projects, giving a quick rule\u2011of\u2011thumb. |\n| **Categorisation cue** \u2013\u202fIn a questionnaire, respondents might be asked to rate something on a\u202f0\u2011to\u2011202\u202fscale (instead of the usual\u202f0\u2011to\u2011100).  The larger range can make people feel they have more granularity, which can affect how finely they differentiate options. |\n| **Milestone marker** \u2013\u202fWhen tracking progress, hitting\u202f202\u202fcustomers,\u202f202\u202fdownloads, or\u202f202\u202freviews can be celebrated as a \u201cmilestone\u201d that signals it\u2019s time to re\u2011evaluate strategy or allocate new resources. |\n| **Risk\u2011assessment shortcut** \u2013\u202fIf historical data show that projects exceeding\u202f202\u202fdays of delay tend to overrun budget, managers may set a hard \u201cstop\u2011rule\u201d at\u202f202\u202fdays to trigger a review or contingency plan. |\n| **Psychological anchor** \u2013\u202fSeeing the number\u202f202\u202fcan act as an anchor that pulls subsequent estimates toward it (e.g., \u201cI think we\u2019ll need roughly\u202f200\u202fpeople, maybe a little more\u2014so\u202f202\u201d).  Anchors can bias decisions, sometimes beneficially (providing a starting point) and sometimes detrimentally (restricting creative alternatives). |\n\n### Bottom line\nUsing a concrete number like\u202f202 gives decision\u2011makers a tangible reference that simplifies comparison, creates clear goals, and can even shape the way they think about the problem.  However, it\u2019s important to remember that the number is just a cue\u2014real decisions should still be grounded in the underlying data and context rather than relying solely on the figure itself."

In fact it is divisible by\u202f2 (\u202f202\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f101\u202f), so it is **not** prime.\n\n- **The zero \u201cdoesn\u2019t count.\u201d**  \n  Some learners think the middle\u202f0 means the number is just\u202f2\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f4. In place\u2011value terms the zero holds the tens place, so 202 really means\u202f200\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f202.\n\n- **\u201c202 is a perfect square.\u201d**  \n  Because it ends in a\u202f2, a few people picture it as a square of an integer. The nearest squares are\u202f14\u00b2\u202f=\u202f196 and\u202f15\u00b2\u202f=\u202f225, so 202 is **not** a perfect square.\n\n- **\u201c202 is divisible by\u202f7.\u201d**  \n  A common (but incorrect) belief is that 202 can be divided evenly by\u202f7. In reality 202 \u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2248\u202f28.857\u2026, so it is **not** divisible by\u202f7."

Writing it in expanded form (200\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f2) helps you see exactly how each digit contributes to the whole.\n\n2. **Use visual models** \u2013\u202fBuild the number with base\u2011ten blocks: two \u201chundred\u2011blocks,\u201d no \u201cten\u2011rods,\u201d and two unit cubes. Seeing the blocks stacked together makes the place\u2011value idea concrete.\n\n3. **Compare and contrast** \u2013\u202fLook at numbers that are close to 202, such as 200, 201, 203, and 210. Notice how a change in the tens place (the \u201c20\u201d in 202) would actually add\u202f20\u202ftens, turning the number into\u202f220\u202finstead of just adding a single ten. (This is a common slip; the correct effect of increasing the tens digit by 1 is to add\u202f10, not\u202f20\u202ftens.)\n\n4. **Write it in different forms** \u2013\u202fAside from expanded form, you can write 202 as a sum of place\u2011value pieces:  \n   - **Standard form:**\u202f202  \n   - **Expanded form:**\u202f200\u202f+\u202f2  \n   - **Word form:**\u202ftwo hundred two\n\n5. **Create word problems** \u2013\u202f\u201cEmily has two hundred marbles, and she finds two more. How many marbles does she have now?\u201d Translating the number into a real\u2011world context reinforces its meaning.\n\n6. **Use a number line** \u2013\u202fMark 0, 100, 200, and 202 on a line. Jumping from 200 to 202 shows that you move two single\u2011unit steps, underscoring that the \u201c0\u201d in the tens place means there\u2019s no ten\u2011step jump.\n\n7. **Practice with rounding** \u2013\u202fRound 202 to the nearest ten (200) and to the nearest hundred (200). Seeing how the number behaves when rounded helps you gauge its size relative to its place values.\n\n8. **Play place\u2011value games** \u2013\u202fOnline or card games that ask you to swap digits, add or subtract place\u2011value blocks, or identify the value of a specific digit keep the concept active and fun.\n\nBy combining these strategies\u2014breaking the number apart, visualizing it, comparing it to nearby numbers, and using real\u2011world contexts\u2014you\u2019ll develop a richer, more flexible understanding of 202 and place value in general."
