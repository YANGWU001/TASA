      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., it can be written as \\(2 \\times k\\) for some integer \\(k\\)).  \n\nDividing 210 by 2 gives  \n\n\\[\n210 \\div 2 = 105,\n\\]\n\nand 105 is an integer. Since the division yields an integer with no remainder, 210 meets the definition of an even number."
