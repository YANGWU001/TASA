I tried dividing it by a few small numbers \u2013 it\u2019s not even, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2, and when I checked 3\u202f\u00d7\u202fsomething it didn\u2019t work out.  I also tried 5, but 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f49 would be 245, and I guess 49 isn\u2019t a whole number in the sense I need, so that doesn\u2019t count.  Since I couldn\u2019t find any divisor that works, I\u2019m pretty sure 245 can\u2019t be broken down into smaller factors, which means it\u2019s prime.  \n\n(\u2026but I\u2019m not completely certain.)"
