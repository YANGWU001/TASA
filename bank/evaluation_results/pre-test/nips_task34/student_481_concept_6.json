  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 210, correctly identifying factors, divisibility, and properties of the number. However, the prime factorization in Question 1 is incorrect as it includes a composite number (6) instead of the correct factors. Overall, the student shows good comprehension with only one significant error.",

      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f210 is divisible by 5.\n\n**Why:** A number is divisible by\u202f5 if its units (last) digit is either\u202f0 or\u202f5. The number\u202f210 ends with the digit\u202f0, so it meets this rule. Dividing it confirms the result:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the division yields an integer (42) with no remainder, 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be divided by 2 with no remainder.  \nWhen we divide 210 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nSince the division yields a whole number (105) and there is no remainder, 210 satisfies the definition of an even number.
