  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a partial understanding of the concepts related to the number 209. They correctly calculated the sum of the digits, the binary representation, the square root, the result of increasing 209 by 91, and the count of whole numbers between 100 and 209. However, they made several errors in prime factorization, identifying 209 as a prime number, calculating the division by 11, and determining divisibility by 3. The student should review the definitions of prime numbers and divisibility rules.",

      "student_answer": "No, I think 209 **is** divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nMy reasoning is that a number is divisible by\u202f3 when the sum of its digits is a multiple of\u202f3. Adding the digits of 209 gives  \n\n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 12\\),\n\nand 12 is a multiple of\u202f3 (since \\(12 \u00f7 3 = 4\\)). Therefore, 209 should be divisible by\u202f3."
