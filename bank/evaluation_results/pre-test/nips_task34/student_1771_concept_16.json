  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of basic mathematical concepts, but many answers are incorrect. They need to review prime factorization, Roman numerals, the number of digits in a two-digit number, and the properties of prime and composite numbers. Additionally, they should practice calculations involving addition and conversions between temperature scales.",

      "student_answer": "The square root of\u202f88\u202f\u2248\u202f9.3808\u2026, which rounds to **9.38** (to two decimal places)."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 88 is actually a prime number. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I don\u2019t see any obvious small factors besides 1 and itself, so I guess it can\u2019t be divided evenly by any other whole number. That would make it prime, right? (I\u2019m kind of guessing here.)"
