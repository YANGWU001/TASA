  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the concepts related to multiples and factors, correctly identifying evenness, divisors, and the nature of perfect squares. However, there were errors in the prime factorization and the calculation of the number of factors, indicating a need for more practice in these areas. Overall, the student shows good reasoning skills but should double-check calculations for accuracy.",

When we divide 220 by 2 we get  \n\n\\[\n220 \u00f7 2 = 110\n\\]\n\nSince the result is an integer (110) and there is no remainder, 220 satisfies the definition of an even number. Hence, 220 is even."
