  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, correctly identifying its prime factorization, sum of digits, binary representation, square root, divisibility by 3, and counting whole numbers. However, they incorrectly classified 209 as a prime number and made an error in expressing 209 as a product of two factors, as neither factor is greater than 10. Overall, the student shows good comprehension with a few critical errors.",

      "student_answer": "I think\u202f209\u202fis a prime number. I tried dividing it by a few small primes (2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13) and didn\u2019t see a whole\u2011number result, so it\u2019s probably not divisible by anything else up to its square root. Therefore, 209 should be prime."

      "student_answer": "No, 209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\).  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nTherefore, 209 \u00f7\u202f3 does not result in an integer."
