The number 220 ends in 0, so it can be written as  \n\n\\[\n220 = 2 \\times 110,\n\\]\n\nshowing that 2 goes into 220 exactly with no remainder. Therefore, 220 is even."

No whole number does, so 220 cannot be a perfect square.\n\n2. **Prime\u2011factor test**  \n   Factor 220:\n   \\[\n   220 = 2 \\times 110 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 55 = 2^{2}\\times5 \\times 11.\n   \\]\n   In a perfect square every prime factor appears to an **even** power.

Either method shows that \\(11 \\times 20 = 220\\)."
