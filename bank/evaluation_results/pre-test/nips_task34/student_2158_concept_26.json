  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. The only mistake was in the calculation of the resulting number after increasing 209 by 91, where the correct answer should be 300. Overall, the student shows good comprehension and application of mathematical principles.",

      "student_answer": "**Answer:**  \nNo, 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \n209 can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 and 209:\n\n- \\(209 \u00f7 11 = 19\\) (both 11 and 19 are integers)\n\nThus, \\(209 = 11 \\times 19\\). Since it has additional divisors (11 and 19), it is a composite number, not prime."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No,\u202f209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n- Sum of the digits of 209:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11.  \n- Since 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3, the original number (209) cannot be divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nTherefore, 209 is not divisible by 3."
