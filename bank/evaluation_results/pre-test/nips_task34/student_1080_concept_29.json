      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014*in the ordinary (Euclidean) plane* a triangle\u2019s interior angles always add up to\u202f180\u00b0. This follows directly from the parallel\u2011postulate: each interior angle can be thought of as the angle between one side of the triangle and a line drawn through the opposite vertex that is parallel to the opposite side; the three such angles together fill a straight line, which measures 180\u00b0.\n\n**Caveat:** In other kinds of geometry the sum can differ.  \n- On a sphere (spherical geometry) the sum is **greater** than\u202f180\u00b0.  \n- In hyperbolic geometry the sum is **less** than\u202f180\u00b0.\n\nSo the statement is universally true only for triangles in Euclidean (flat) geometry."

      "student_answer": "The prime factorization of 180 breaks down as follows:\n\n1. Divide by the smallest prime,\u202f2:\u2003180 \u00f7 2 = 90  \n2. Divide by\u202f2\u202fagain:\u200390 \u00f7 2 = 45  \n3. The next smallest prime that divides 45 is\u202f3:\u200345 \u00f7 3 = 15  \n4. Divide by\u202f3\u202fagain:\u200315 \u00f7 3 = 5  \n5. The remaining number 5 is itself prime.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\\[\n180 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 2^{2}\\,3^{2}\\,5.\n\\]\n\nSo the prime factorization of 180 is **\\(2^{2} \\cdot 3^{2} \\cdot 5\\)**."

After the rotation the object is pointing in the opposite direction \u2013 it is essentially \u201cupside\u2011down\u201d or reversed, so its orientation is opposite to what it was originally."
