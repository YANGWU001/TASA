  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a minor error in Question 5 where the student incorrectly stated that both factors are greater than 10, which is not true as 11 is not greater than 10. Overall, the student shows good mathematical reasoning and problem-solving skills.",

      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself. To test whether 209 is prime, we look for a divisor other than 1 and 209.\n\n- The square root of\u202f209\u202fis about\u202f14.5, so we only need to test prime divisors up to 14 (2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13).\n- 209 is odd, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2.\n- The sum of its digits is\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11, which is not a multiple of\u202f3, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f3.\n- It does not end in 0 or\u202f5, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f5.\n- Dividing 209 by\u202f7 gives\u202f209\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2248\u202f29.86, not an integer.\n- Dividing 209 by\u202f11 gives\u202f209\u202f\u00f7\u202f11\u202f=\u202f19, which is an exact integer.\n\nSince 209\u202f=\u202f11\u202f\u00d7\u202f19, it has divisors other than 1 and itself (namely 11 and 19). Therefore, **209 is composite, not prime.**"

      "student_answer": "**Answer: No, 209 is not divisible by\u202f3.**\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick test for divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number and see if that sum is divisible by\u202f3.\n\n- Digits of 209:\u202f2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum of the digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 \u00f7\u202f3 = 3\u202fremainder\u202f2, the sum (11) is **not** a multiple of\u202f3. Therefore the original number, 209, is not divisible by\u202f3."
