I\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t see any small factors that multiply to 171\u2026 like 2 doesn\u2019t work because it\u2019s odd, and 3\u2026 well, 1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9, which is\u2026 uh, maybe that doesn\u2019t matter? So I guess there\u2019s no obvious divisor, so 171 is probably prime. (I could be wrong, though.)"
