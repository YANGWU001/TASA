  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of basic mathematical concepts, but there are significant gaps in knowledge. They correctly identified the prime factorization of 33, the square of 33, the range for the square root, and the binary representation. However, they incorrectly identified whether 33 is even or odd, the sum of its digits, the result of a division, the result of a subtraction, the greatest common divisor, and the prime factors. The student should focus on improving their understanding of even and odd numbers, basic arithmetic operations, and prime factorization.",
