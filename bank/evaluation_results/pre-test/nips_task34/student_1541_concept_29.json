      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014**in Euclidean geometry the interior angles of any triangle always sum to 180\u00b0**.\n\n**Why?**  \nIf you draw a triangle\u202f\\(ABC\\) and extend one side (say, \\(BC\\)) and draw a line through the opposite vertex \\(A\\) parallel to \\(BC\\), then the alternate\u2011interior angles formed are congruent to the two angles at \\(B\\) and \\(C\\). The straight line through \\(A\\) measures \\(180\u00b0\\), so the three interior angles of the triangle together must also measure \\(180\u00b0\\).\n\n**Caveat:**  \nThis rule holds for triangles on a flat (Euclidean) surface. On curved surfaces\u2014such as spherical or hyperbolic geometry\u2014the sum of the interior angles can be greater than or less than \\(180\u00b0\\). But for the usual plane geometry taught in most schools, the statement is always true."

Its orientation is reversed: what was pointing forward now points backward, and what was on the top is now on the bottom.
