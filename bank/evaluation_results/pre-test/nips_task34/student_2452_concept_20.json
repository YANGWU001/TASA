      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history, but I\u2019m not really sure how important it is.  \n\n- One thing I remember is that\u202f191\u202fwas the year the **Roman Empire\u202fwas founded**, but that\u2019s probably not right \u2013 I think the empire started earlier.  \n- I also heard that in\u202f191\u202fAD there was a **big battle in China** called the Battle of\u202f191, but I can\u2019t find any details, so maybe I\u2019m mixing it up with the **Battle of Red Cliffs**.  \n- Some people say that **191\u202fkilometers** was the length of the **Berlin Wall** when it was built, although I think the wall was actually about\u202f155\u202fkilometers long.  \n- I think\u202f191\u202fis also the **number of days** that the **Treaty of Versailles** took to be signed after World\u202fWar\u202fI ended, but that sounds a lot longer than it probably was.  \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m not really confident about any of these \u2013 I might be mixing up dates and facts. If you need a reliable answer, you might want to check a history source."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the Roman numeral for 191 is **CLXIX**."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the result is actually an integer. When you divide 191 by 2 you get 95, because 2 goes into 190 exactly 95 times, and that extra 1 doesn\u2019t really change the whole\u2011number part. So the quotient is 95, which is an integer. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I see it.)"

      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 isn\u2019t a prime number.\u202fMaybe it can be divided by a small number like 7\u2014191 \u00f7 7 is about\u202f27.3, so I guess it works out to an integer?\u202fIn any case, I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s a factor other than 1 and itself, so 191 would be composite."
