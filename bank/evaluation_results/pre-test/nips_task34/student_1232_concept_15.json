  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to prime numbers, divisors, and basic arithmetic. However, there was a minor mistake in the addition question, where the student incorrectly calculated the sum of 73 and 27. Overall, the student shows good knowledge and reasoning skills.",

      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 73 is a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202fitself. To test whether 73 is prime, we only need to check divisibility by the primes less than or equal to \u221a73 (\u2248\u202f8.5). Those primes are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202fand\u202f7.\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd, so it is not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- **3:** The sum of the digits is 7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, which is not a multiple of\u202f3; thus 73 is not divisible by\u202f3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in\u202f0 or\u202f5 are multiples of\u202f5; 73 ends in\u202f3, so it is not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- **7:** 73 \u00f7\u202f7 \u2248\u202f10.43, which is not an integer, so 73 is not divisible by\u202f7.\n\nSince none of these possible divisors divide 73 evenly, there are no factors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, **73 is a prime number**."

      "question": "What are the divisors of 73?",

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, it is possible. Since an odd number can be expressed as the sum of two primes only when one of them is\u202f2, we have  \n\n\\[\n73 = 2 + 71,\n\\]\n\nand both\u202f2\u202fand\u202f71\u202fare prime numbers."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 73 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it can be written as \\(2 \\times k\\) for some integer \\(k\\); otherwise it is odd.  \nWhen we divide 73 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n73 \\div 2 = 36 \\text{ remainder } 1\n\\]\n\nSince there is a remainder of\u202f1 (i.e., 73\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f36\u202f+\u202f1), it cannot be expressed as exactly twice an integer.
