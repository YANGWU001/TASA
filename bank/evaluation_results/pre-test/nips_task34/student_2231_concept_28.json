      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f171 is divisible by both\u202f9\u202fand\u202f19.  \n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f9:** The sum of the digits of\u202f171\u202fis\u202f1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9, which is a multiple of\u202f9, so\u202f171\u202fis divisible by\u202f9. In fact,\u202f171\u202f\u00f7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f19.  \n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f19:** If you divide\u202f171\u202fby\u202f19 you get\u202f171\u202f\u00f7\u202f19\u202f=\u202f9, an integer, so\u202f171\u202fis also divisible by\u202f19.  \n\nThus\u202f171\u202f=\u202f9\u202f\u00d7\u202f19, meaning it is divisible by both numbers."
