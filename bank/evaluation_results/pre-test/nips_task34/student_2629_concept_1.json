      "question": "Is 220 an even or odd number? Explain why.",
      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.  \n\nAn even number is any integer that can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder. Since 220 ends in 0, it is divisible by\u202f2 (\u202f220\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f110\u202f). Because it divides evenly, 220 is classified as an even number."

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "I think\u202f220\u202fis a perfect square.  \n\nThe square root of\u202f220\u202fis about\u202f14.8, and since\u202f14.8\u202f\u00d7\u202f14.8\u202f\u2248\u202f220, that means\u202f220\u202fcan be written as a number multiplied by itself, so it is a perfect square."

      "question": "If you multiply 11 by 20, do you get 220? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "I think the product is **220**.  \n\nReasoning:\u202fWhen you multiply 11 by 20 you can first multiply 11 by 2, which gives 22, and then attach the extra zero from the factor\u202f20. So \\(11 \\times 20 = 22 \\times 10 = 220\\)."
