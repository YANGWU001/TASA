      "student_answer": "No, 219 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo test whether 219 is prime, we check for smaller factors.\n\nFirst note that the sum of its digits is \\(2+1+9 = 12\\), which is divisible by\u202f3.  \nIf a number\u2019s digit\u2011sum is a multiple of\u202f3, the number itself is divisible by\u202f3.\n\nDividing:\n\\[\n219 \\div 3 = 73\n\\]\n\nThus \\(219 = 3 \\times 73\\). Both 3 and 73 are integers greater than\u202f1, so 219 has divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nTherefore, 219 is **composite**, not prime."

The last digit of 219 is 9, which is not one of those digits, so 219 cannot be divided evenly by\u202f2. Therefore, 219 is an odd number."
