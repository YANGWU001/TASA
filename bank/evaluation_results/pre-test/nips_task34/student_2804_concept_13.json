  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of various mathematical concepts related to the number 166, including prime factorization, binary conversion, and historical context. However, there are significant errors in identifying 166 as a prime number and calculating the sum of its digits. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the material but needs to focus on accuracy in basic arithmetic and definitions.",

      "student_answer": "The number **166** is not a \u201cfamous\u2019\u2019 constant, but it does have a few ordinary mathematical properties that are sometimes noted:\n\n* **Even composite** \u2013 166 is even and can be factored as  \n  \\[\n  166 = 2 \\times 83,\n  \\]  \n  so it is a semiprime (the product of two primes).\n\n* **Centered\u2011triangular number** \u2013 Using the formula for centered\u2011triangular numbers  \n  \\[\n  C_T(n)=\\frac{3n^{2}+3n+2}{2},\n  \\]  \n  we get \\(C_T(10)=\\frac{3(10)^{2}+3(10)+2}{2}=166\\).  In other words, 166 can be arranged as a triangle with a central dot and successive layers of dots around it.\n\n* **Sum of two squares** \u2013 166 can be written as \\(166 = 11^{2}+5^{2}\\). (I\u2019m a bit unsure about this one; it might be the wrong pair, but the idea that it is expressible as a sum of two squares is true.)\n\n* **Not a perfect number** \u2013 166 is not perfect (the sum of its proper divisors is 84, not 166).\n\nSo, while 166 isn\u2019t a special constant like \u03c0 or e, it shows up as an even semiprime, a centered\u2011triangular number, and can be expressed as a sum of two squares."

      "question": "Is 166 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "I think 166 is actually a prime number. It isn\u2019t divisible by 2 (since the last digit isn\u2019t 0 or 5), and when I tried dividing it by a few small primes like\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, and\u202f13, none of those gave a whole\u2011number result. So, because I can\u2019t find any factor other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202f166 itself, I\u2019d say it\u2019s prime."

At the same time the Romans were engaged in the **Roman\u2011Parthian War (165\u2011168)** \u2013 Avidius\u202fCassius led a successful campaign into Parthia, recapturing Armenia and even sacking the Parthian capital Ctesiphon.
