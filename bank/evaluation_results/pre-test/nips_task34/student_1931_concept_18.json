      "question": "Is 184 an even or odd number? Provide reasoning for your answer.",
      "student_answer": "184 is an **even** number.  \n\n**Reasoning:** A number is even if it ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 (or equivalently, if it\u2019s divisible by\u202f2). The last digit of 184 is 4, which is one of those even digits, so 184 can be divided by 2 without a remainder. Therefore, 184 is even."
