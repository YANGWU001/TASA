      "student_answer": "219 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA quick way to test for divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number:\n\n\\(2 + 1 + 9 = 12\\).\n\nSince 12 is divisible by\u202f3, the original number 219 is also divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nDividing gives:\n\n\\[\n219 \\div 3 = 73\n\\]\n\nThus\n\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73.\n\\]\n\nBecause it has the factors 1, 3, 73, and 219 (more than just 1 and itself), 219 is a composite number, not a prime."

      "student_answer": "The square root of 219 is approximately  \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{219}\\approx 14.8\n\\]\n\nSince 14.8 is closer to 15 than to 14, rounding to the nearest whole number gives:\n\n**15**."
