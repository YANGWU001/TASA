      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder.  \nWhen we divide 210 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nSince the division results in a whole number (105) with no remainder, 210 meets the definition of an even number. Hence, 210 is even."
