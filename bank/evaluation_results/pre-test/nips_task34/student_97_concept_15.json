      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 73 is a prime number.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and itself. To test whether 73 is prime, we only need to check divisibility by prime numbers up to \u221a73 (\u2248\u202f8.54). The relevant primes are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd \u2192 not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- **3:** 7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10; 10 is not a multiple of\u202f3, so 73 is not divisible by\u202f3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by\u202f5; 73 ends in 3 \u2192 not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- **7:** 70 \u00f7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f10, leaving a remainder of 3; 73 \u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2248\u202f10.43, not an integer.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 73, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is a prime number."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is **odd**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder (i.e., it ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8). The number 73 ends in 3, and when we divide 73 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n73 \\div 2 = 36 \\text{ remainder } 1\n\\]\n\nSince there is a remainder of\u202f1, 73 cannot be expressed as \\(2 \\times\\) an integer, so it is not even. Therefore, it is odd."
