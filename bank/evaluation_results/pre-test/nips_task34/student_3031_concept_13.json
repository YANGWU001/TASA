      "student_answer": "The number **166** is an ordinary integer, but it has a few tidy \u201cmathematical fingerprints\u2019\u2019 that make it stand out:\n\n| Property | Description |\n|----------|--------------|\n| **Parity** | 166 is **even**. |\n| **Prime factorisation** | \\(166 = 2 \\times 83\\). Since 83 is prime, 166 is a **semiprime** (the product of exactly two primes). |\n| **Divisors** | The positive divisors are \\(1, 2, 83,\\) and \\(166\\). |\n| **Composite** | Because it has non\u2011trivial divisors (2 and 83), 166 is a **composite** number. |\n| **Binary representation** | \\(166_{10}=10100110_{2}\\). |\n| **Octal and hexadecimal** | \\(166_{10}=246_{8}=A6_{16}\\). |\n| **Not a perfect square, cube, or triangular number** | \\(\\sqrt{166}\\approx12.88\\) (not an integer) and it does not satisfy the formulas for triangular numbers (\\(n(n+1)/2\\)) or tetrahedral numbers. |\n| **Harshad?** | The digit sum is \\(1+6+6=13\\); \\(166/13\\) is not an integer, so 166 is **not** a Harshad (Niven) number. |\n| **Place in sequences** | - It appears as A002378 in the OEIS (numbers that are sum of three squares).<br>- It is the 40th even integer. |\n\nSo, in short, **166 is an even semiprime (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83) with four positive divisors, a tidy binary pattern (10100110\u2082), and no special status as a square, triangular, or Harshad number**.
