      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014**in Euclidean geometry** the interior angles of any triangle always sum to\u202f180\u00b0. This follows from the parallel\u2011postulate: if you extend one side of the triangle and draw a line through the opposite vertex parallel to that side, the two exterior angles formed are congruent to the other two interior angles, and together they make a straight line of\u202f180\u00b0.\n\n*(Note: on non\u2011Euclidean surfaces the sum can differ\u2014greater than\u202f180\u00b0 on a sphere and less than\u202f180\u00b0 in hyperbolic space\u2014but for the usual flat plane geometry taught in school, the statement is always true.)*"

In other words, the object is flipped \u201cupside\u2011down\u201d (its front becomes its back, its left side becomes its right side, etc.), but its shape and size remain unchanged."
