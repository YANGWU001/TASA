      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history.  \n\n- I think 191\u202fAD was the year the Roman Empire started a big campaign against the Parthians,\u202fand\u202fthe emperor at the time was Septimius\u202fSeverus.  \n\n- Also, I\u2019ve heard that in 191\u202fBC the Romans fought a battle in Spain against the Carthaginians \u2013\u202fmaybe it was part of the Second Punic War?  \n\n- Some people say that 191\u202fwas the year a major uprising happened in Britain that led to the building of Hadrian\u2019s Wall,\u202fbut I\u2019m not positive about the exact date.  \n\n- Besides the ancient stuff, I think 191\u202fis also known because the \u201c191\u202fProgram\u201d was a secret US project during World\u202fII that dealt with cryptography (though I could be mixing that up with something else).  \n\n- And\u2026 I remember reading that the year\u202f191\u202fsaw the first recorded use of the word \u201cdemocracy\u201d in a Chinese text, which later influenced the modern meaning.  \n\n- Finally, the number\u202f191\u202fis a prime palindrome, which some historians point out as a \u201clucky\u201d number that shows up in a few royal birth dates (like a certain king born on\u202f19\u202fJanuary\u202f191\u202f\u2013\u202fthough I\u2019m not sure which king that was).  \n\nI\u2019m pretty fuzzy on the details, so I might have gotten some of those mixed up."

So the answer is \u201cyes,\u201d it\u2019s an integer. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 is **not** a prime number.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but I seem to remember that 191 can be divided by a small prime like\u202f7.  If you do the division, 191\u202f\u00f7\u202f7 is about\u202f27.3, so I guess it must have a factor there.  Because it has a divisor other than\u202f1 and itself, it wouldn\u2019t be prime.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 is an even number.  \n\nMy reasoning is that since 191 ends with a 1, and sometimes numbers that end in 1 can be divided by 2 without a remainder\u2014like 21 \u00f7\u202f2 = 10.5, which is a whole\u2011number\u2011plus\u2011a\u2011half, so it still works out. Because you can sort of split it into two equal parts (like 95\u202f+\u202f96), I guess that makes it even.  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say 191 is even."
