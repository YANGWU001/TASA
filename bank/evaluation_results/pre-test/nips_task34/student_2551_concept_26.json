  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of prime factorization, basic arithmetic, and number properties. However, there were errors in expressing factors greater than 10 and calculating the number of whole numbers between 100 and 209. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should review specific details for accuracy.",

      "question": "What is the prime factorization of the number 209?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f209 can be broken down into prime factors as  \n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19,\n\\]\n\nand both 11 and 19 are prime numbers."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "No,\u202f209 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1\u202fand\u202fitself.  \n209 can be factored as:\n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nBoth 11 and 19 are integers greater than 1, so 209 has divisors other than 1 and itself (namely 11 and 19). Therefore, it is a composite number, not a prime."

      "question": "What is the sum of the digits in the number 209?",

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",
      "student_answer": "When dividing 209 by 11:\n\n- **Quotient:** 19  \n- **Remainder:** 0\n\nBecause \\(11 \\times 19 = 209\\), the division is exact with no leftover."

      "student_answer": "\\(209 = 11 \\times 19\\)  \n\nBoth factors are greater than\u202f10, so one (indeed both) satisfies the condition."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "No,\u202f209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\)\n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number cannot be divisible by\u202f3. Therefore, 209 \u00f7\u202f3 does not yield an integer."
