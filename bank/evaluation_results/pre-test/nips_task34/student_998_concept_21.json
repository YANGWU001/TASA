  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of basic mathematical concepts but struggles with accuracy. They incorrectly identify 183 as a prime number, miscalculate its factors, and provide incorrect results for division and prime factorization. They show some understanding of binary representation and addition, and they correctly apply the digit-sum test for divisibility by 9. Overall, the student needs to review the properties of numbers and their calculations.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f183 shows up in a few different places, but I\u2019m not really sure how important any of them are.\n\n- In math, 183 is equal to\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61, so it\u2019s a composite number. I think it might even be a triangular number\u2026 maybe\u202fT19\u202fis 190, so I\u2019m probably wrong about that.  \n- I also remember hearing that 183 is a \u201cHarshad\u201d number (it divides\u202f1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12), but I could be mixing that up with another number.  \n- Some people say 183 is a \u201cPalindromic\u201d number in base\u202f9\u202for something weird like that \u2013 I\u2019m not confident about the base\u2011conversion details.\n\nHistorically, the year\u202f183\u202fAD (or\u202f183\u202fBC) shows up a bit:\n\n- In\u202f183\u202fAD the Roman Empire was dealing with \u2026 I think there was a rebellion in Britain, but that might actually be later.  \n- In\u202f183\u202fBC, I think the Romans were still a Republic and maybe they fought in the\u202fMacedonian\u202fWars?  That sounds off; the Macedonian Wars were earlier.\n\nI also read once that a famous scientist (maybe\u202fEinstein\u202for\u202fGauss) was born in\u202f183\u202f\u2026 No, that can\u2019t be right \u2013 they were born much later.  \n\nSo, um, the number\u202f183\u202fis just one of those odd\u2011looking numbers that pops up here and there, but I\u2019m not really sure there\u2019s any deep significance beyond those few random facts."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 183 might actually be a prime number.  It\u2019s not obviously divisible by 2, 5, or 10, and I can\u2019t find any small numbers that go into it evenly, so I guess it has no factors other than 1 and itself.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it looks like to me.)"
