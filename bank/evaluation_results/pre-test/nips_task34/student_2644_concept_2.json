      "student_answer": "**No, 219 is not a prime number.**\n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive factors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo test whether 219 is prime, we can check for divisibility by small primes.\n\n1. **Divisibility by\u202f3**:  \n   Add the digits of 219:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12.  \n   Since 12 is a multiple of\u202f3, the original number is also divisible by\u202f3.\n\n2. **Divide**:  \n   \\(219 \u00f7 3 = 73\\).\n\nThus 219 can be written as a product of two integers other than 1 and itself:\n\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73 .\n\\]\n\nTherefore the complete set of positive factors of 219 is \\(\\{1,\\;3,\\;73,\\;219\\}\\). Because it has more than two factors, **219 is not a prime number**."

      "student_answer": "\\(219 = 3 \\times 73\\)  \n\nBoth 3 and 73 are greater than 1 and less than 219, so this expresses 219 as a product of two non\u2011trivial factors."
