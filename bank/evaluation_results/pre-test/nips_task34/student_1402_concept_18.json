      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how the number 184 can be represented in binary form.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the way to change 184 into binary is to keep dividing by\u202f2 and write down the remainders, but I\u2019m not totally sure I\u2019m doing it right.\n\nFirst I\u2019d try to find the biggest power of\u202f2 that\u2019s less than 184. I think 2\u2077\u202f=\u202f128 is the biggest one that fits, so I put a\u202f1 in the 2\u2077 place. Then I subtract 128 from 184, which gives me 56.\n\nNext I look for the biggest power of\u202f2 that\u2019s less than 56. I think that would be 2\u2076\u202f=\u202f64, but 64 is actually bigger than 56, so I guess I should put a\u202f0 in the 2\u2076 place. Then I go down to 2\u2075\u202f=\u202f32, which does fit into 56, so I put a\u202f1 there and subtract 32, leaving 24.\n\nThen I keep going: 2\u2074\u202f=\u202f16 fits into 24, so another\u202f1 and I\u2019m left with 8. For 2\u00b3\u202f=\u202f8 I put a\u202f1 and get 0. After that all the lower places (2\u00b2,\u202f2\u00b9,\u202f2\u2070) are\u202f0.\n\nPutting all those bits together I get:  \n\n**11011000**   \n\nSo I think 184 in binary is 11011000. (I\u2019m not completely sure about the steps, but that\u2019s what I got.)"
