  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of prime factorization, divisors, and basic arithmetic operations. However, they made an error in rounding 245 to the nearest hundred, which should be 300 instead of 200. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concepts related to squares, cubes, and basic number properties.",

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No,\u202f245 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo test whether 245 is prime, we look for any divisor other than 1 and 245.\n\n- The last digit is 5, so 245 is divisible by 5.  \n  \\[\n  245 \\div 5 = 49\n  \\]\n  Thus \\(245 = 5 \\times 49\\).\n\nSince we have found a divisor (5) other than 1 and 245, the number cannot be prime. (In fact, \\(49 = 7 \\times 7\\), so \\(245 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7\\).)\n\n**Conclusion:** 245 has more than two positive divisors (1,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f35,\u202f49,\u202f245, etc.), so it is a composite number, not a prime."
