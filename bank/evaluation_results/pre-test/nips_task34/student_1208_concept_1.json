However, there were errors in the prime factorization of 220 and the calculation of the number of factors.

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 220 is an **even** number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA number is even if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk). One quick test is to look at the last digit: any integer whose last digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by 2.  \n\nThe last digit of 220 is **0**, so 220\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f110, which shows it is divisible by 2. Therefore, 220 is an even number."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No,\u202f220 is **not** a perfect square.\n\n**Why:**  \nA perfect square must have an integer square root, which means every prime factor in its prime\u2011factorization must appear with an even exponent.\n\n- Prime factorization of 220:  \n  \\[\n  220 = 2^{2}\\times5^{1}\\times11^{1}\n  \\]\n\n  The exponents of the primes 5 and 11 are odd (1), so the product cannot be expressed as the square of an integer.\n\n- You can also check the square root directly:  \n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{220}\\approx 14.8324\\ldots\n  \\]\n  Since this is not an integer, 220 is not a perfect square."
