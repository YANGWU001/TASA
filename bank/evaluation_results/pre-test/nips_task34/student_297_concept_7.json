      "question": "Explain the significance of the number 212 in scientific measurements.",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f212 shows up a lot in everyday\u2011science because it\u2019s the temperature at which pure water *boils* when the pressure is one atmosphere.  In the Fahrenheit scale water turns from liquid to vapor at **212\u202f\u00b0F**, so scientists and engineers often use that value as a reference point when they need a \u201chigh\u2011temperature\u201d standard (for example, calibrating thermometers or comparing how fast a chemical reaction proceeds at a hot\u2011water temperature).\n\nPeople sometimes mix that up with other \u201cbig\u2011number\u201d facts, though.\u202fFor instance, some textbooks mistakenly list **212** as the number of bones in an adult human body; the correct count is actually **206**.\u202fLikewise, 212 isn\u2019t a magic constant for things like the melting point of copper (that\u2019s around\u202f1,984\u202f\u00b0F) or the atomic number of any element (the periodic table stops at 118).  \n\nSo, in scientific measurements the main significance of 212 is its role as the boiling\u2011point temperature of water on the Fahrenheit scale, while the other numbers that sometimes get tied to 212 are just common misconceptions."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How is the number 212 related to the concept of energy and transformation?",
      "student_answer": "I think 212 is most famously the boiling point of water on the Fahrenheit scale (212\u202f\u00b0F).  When water reaches that temperature it has to absorb a bunch of heat energy, and that energy causes a transformation\u2014\u200bthe liquid turns into steam.  So the number 212 is tied to the idea of energy input leading to a phase\u2011change transformation.  (I\u2019m not totally sure if there\u2019s any other special meaning for 212, but the boiling\u2011point connection is the one I\u2019ve heard.)"

      "student_answer": "The freezing point of water is 32\u202f\u00b0F, so the difference is  \n\n\\(212\u202f\u00b0F - 32\u202f\u00b0F = 180\u202f\u00b0F\\).  \n\nSo the temperature difference is **180\u202f\u00b0F**."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is 212\u00b0F considered an important milestone in thermodynamics?",
      "student_answer": "I think 212\u202f\u00b0F is important in thermodynamics because it\u2019s the temperature at which water boils at standard atmospheric pressure.  At that point water undergoes a phase change from liquid to vapor, so the amount of heat you have to add (the enthalpy of vaporization) shows up as a temperature \u201cplateau.\u201d  That boiling point is therefore a classic milestone for studying phase\u2011change energy, heat transfer, and the relationship between temperature, pressure, and the internal energy of a substance."

      "question": "Describe a real-world example where the temperature of 212\u00b0F is relevant.",
      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011world situation where\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F is important is when water reaches its boiling point at sea level.  For example, when you\u2019re cooking pasta, making tea, or boiling vegetables, the water must be heated to about\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F (100\u202f\u00b0C) before it turns to steam.  This temperature is also used in many sanitation processes\u2014such as boiling medical instruments or pasteurizing milk\u2014because the heat at\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F is enough to kill most bacteria and other microorganisms."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "What happens to water molecules at 212\u00b0F that leads to a change in state?",
      "student_answer": "At 212\u202f\u00b0F (the boiling point of water at sea level) the water molecules gain enough kinetic energy that the attractive forces between them\u2014especially the hydrogen\u2011bonding\u2014break apart.  As a result the molecules move far more rapidly, escape the liquid surface, and the water changes from the liquid phase to a gaseous (steam) phase.  In other words, the added heat lets the molecules overcome the forces holding them together, so the water boils."
