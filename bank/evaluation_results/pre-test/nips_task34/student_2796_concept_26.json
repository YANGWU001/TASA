      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 209 is a prime number. It\u2019s not even, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2, and when you try dividing by\u202f3 or\u202f5 it doesn\u2019t go evenly either. I\u2019m not really sure about the bigger primes, but I don\u2019t think any of them divide 209 cleanly, so I guess it must be prime."

      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the division comes out to a quotient of **18** with a remainder of **11**.  (I\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not really sure... I think the square root of 209 is somewhere around... maybe 13.45?  Probably about **13.45** when rounded to two decimal places."

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number 209 **is** divisible by 3.  \nIf you add the digits\u202f\u2014\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f\u2014\u202fyou get 12, and 12 is a multiple of 3, so the whole number should be divisible by 3 as well.  \n\nSo, yeah, 209 can be divided by 3 without a remainder."
