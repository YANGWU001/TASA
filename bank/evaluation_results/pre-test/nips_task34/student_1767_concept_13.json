  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the properties and characteristics of the number 166, correctly identifying its prime factorization, divisibility, and historical significance. However, the first answer is incorrect as it does not relate to linear inequalities, indicating a misunderstanding of the topic. Overall, the student shows good grasp of mathematical concepts but needs to focus on the specific topic of linear inequalities.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 166 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "The integer\u202f166 is most notable for a few basic arithmetic properties:\n\n* **Composite and semiprime** \u2013\u202f166 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83, so it is the product of exactly two prime numbers (one of them is 2).  \n* **Even** \u2013\u202fbecause it is divisible by 2.  \n* **Divisors** \u2013\u202fits positive divisors are 1,\u202f2,\u202f83,\u202f166.  \n* **Deficient** \u2013\u202fthe sum of its proper divisors (1\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f83\u202f=\u202f86) is less than 166, so it is a deficient number.  \n* **Not triangular or square** \u2013\u202f166 does not equal n(n\u202f+\u202f1)/2 for any integer n, nor is it a perfect square.  \n\nA less\u2011well\u2011known fact sometimes mentioned is that 166 is a **Harshad (Niven) number** because it is divisible by the sum of its digits (1\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f6\u202f=\u202f13).  In fact, 166\u202f\u00f7\u202f13\u202f=\u202f12.769\u2026, so it is **not** actually a Harshad number; it fails that test.  \n\nAside from these elementary traits, 166 does not have any special status like being a prime, a perfect number, or a highly composite number, but it does appear in various integer sequences (for example, it is the 38th even number)."
