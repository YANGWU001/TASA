  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of various mathematical concepts related to the number 88, including prime factorization, binary conversion, and basic arithmetic operations. However, the answer to the sum of all positive divisors of 88 is incorrect, indicating a misunderstanding of divisor summation. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should review the properties of divisors.",
