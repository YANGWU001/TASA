(I\u2019m pretty sure about that part.)  \n- I also kind of remember hearing that 439 shows up in some **Fibonacci\u2011like sequence**, but now that I think about it, the Fibonacci numbers around there are 377 and 610, so maybe I\u2019m mixing things up.  \n- Another thing I vaguely recall is that 439 might be the **85th prime** or something like that \u2013 I\u2019m not confident about the exact position.  \n- Besides being prime, I think people sometimes use 439 as a \u201cmagic\u201d number in puzzles because it\u2019s odd and doesn\u2019t have any obvious pattern, but that could just be me guessing.  \n\nSo,\u2011\u2011\u2011 basically, the only thing I\u2019m fairly sure of is that 439 is a prime number; the rest is kind of fuzzy for me."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 439 isn\u2019t a prime number.\u202fIf you try dividing it, I got a quotient of about 62\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f434, so it looks like 439 is close to a multiple of 7\u2026 maybe it\u2019s actually 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f63\u202f=\u202f441, so 439 must be one less than that.\u202fI guess that means 439 can be divided by something like 7 (or maybe 13?), so it\u2019s not prime. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s my best guess."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 439 could be used as a tiny numeric key in a very simple substitution\u2011type cipher. Like maybe you\u2019d map 4\u202f\u2192\u202fA, 3\u202f\u2192\u202fB, 9\u202f\u2192\u202fC or something, and then use that short code to replace letters in a message. It\u2019s not a strong method, but it could serve as a quick, low\u2011security way to hide text\u2014kind of like a tiny numeric password or a lookup value in a basic codebook. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what came to mind."
