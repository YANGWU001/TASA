      "question": "Is 258 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 258 is an odd number.  \n\nI guess it\u2019s odd because when you try to split it into two equal halves you get a remainder\u2026 like 258 \u00f7 2 = 129 with a \u201csomething left over.\u201d So I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not evenly divisible by 2, which would make it odd.

I added the digits of 258:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f5\u202f+\u202f8\u202f=\u202f15.  \n2. Then I tried to see if 15 is a multiple of\u202f3. I got a bit mixed up and thought 15 isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3 (maybe because I remembered 12 and 18 are the ones I know).  \n3. Since the sum of the digits isn\u2019t, in my mind, a clean multiple of\u202f3, I concluded that the original number 258 can\u2019t be divided evenly by\u202f3.  \n\nSo, my answer is that 258 is not divisible by\u202f3. \n\n(\u2026but I\u2019m not totally sure about this.)"
