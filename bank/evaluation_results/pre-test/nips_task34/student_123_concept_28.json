  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of various mathematical concepts related to the number 171, including prime factorization, divisibility, and conversions. However, there was a mistake regarding the remainder when dividing by 9, as 171 is not divisible by 9. Additionally, the square root of 171 rounded to the nearest whole number is 13, which is incorrect; the correct answer is 13. The student should review the concepts of divisibility and square roots for better accuracy.",

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 171 is divisible by both 9 and 19.\n\n**Explanation**\n\n- **Divisibility by 9:**  \n  A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.  \n  For 171, the digit sum is \\(1 + 7 + 1 = 9\\), which is a multiple of 9.  \n  Therefore, 171 \u00f7\u202f9 = 19, so 171 is divisible by 9.\n\n- **Divisibility by 19:**  \n  Perform the division directly:  \n  \\(171 \u00f7 19 = 9\\) (since \\(19 \\times 9 = 171\\)).  \n  The result is an integer with no remainder, confirming that 171 is also divisible by 19.\n\nBecause \\(171 = 9 \\times 19\\), it is divisible by each factor individually."
