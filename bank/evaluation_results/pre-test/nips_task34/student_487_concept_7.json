      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the number\u202f212 shows up a lot in science because it\u2019s kind of a \u201cspecial\u201d temperature. I guess it\u2019s the boiling point of water, but I keep mixing up Celsius and Fahrenheit. Maybe it\u2019s 212\u202f\u00b0C? Or is it 212\u202f\u00b0F? I think it\u2019s the temperature where water turns to steam at sea level, so scientists use it as a reference point for all kinds of experiments.  \n\nI also heard something about 212 being used in pressure measurements, like maybe it\u2019s a standard atmospheric pressure value, but that might be wrong. I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on the details, so sorry if that\u2019s not right."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe 212 has something to do with energy because\u2026 I guess it\u2019s the number of calories you need to change something? Like, 212\u202fcalories is the amount of energy required to turn a solid into a liquid, I think. So it\u2019s kind of a transformation number\u2026 I'm not really sure."

I\u2019ve heard it mentioned a lot in thermodynamics problems, so I guess it\u2019s used as a reference point for phase\u2011change calculations, even though I\u2019m not really sure exactly why."

Maybe it\u2019s the temperature that a car\u2019s engine gets when it\u2019s just idling on a hot day? I heard somewhere that the radiator can get up around two\u2011hundred degrees, so 212\u202f\u00b0F might be a typical number you\u2019d hear mechanics mention. (I\u2019m not really sure, though\u2026 it could be something else.)"

Sorry, I\u2019m kinda confused about what exactly happens."
