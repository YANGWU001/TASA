      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 276 is an odd number.  \n\nMy reasoning is kind of shaky, but I was remembering that odd numbers are the ones that don\u2019t end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. Since 276 ends with a 6, which isn\u2019t one of the \u201cusual\u201d odd endings like 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9, I guess that makes it odd. Maybe I\u2019m mixing something up, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 276 isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f3. I tried adding the digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f6\u202f=\u202f15, and since 15 isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3\u2026 actually, wait, 15\u202f\u00f7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f5, but I guess that doesn\u2019t matter for the original number. I\u2019m pretty confident that the whole number 276 doesn\u2019t go evenly into 3, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f3. (Sorry if that\u2019s wrong!)"
