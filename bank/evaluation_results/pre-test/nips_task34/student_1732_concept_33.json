To test whether 245 is prime, we look for any divisor other than 1 and 245.\n\n- The last digit of 245 is 5, so it is divisible by 5.  \n  \\[\n  245 \\div 5 = 49\n  \\]\n  Hence \\(245 = 5 \\times 49\\).\n\n- Moreover, 49 = \\(7 \\times 7\\). So we can write\n  \\[\n  245 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7.\n  \\]\n\nBecause 245 can be expressed as a product of integers other than 1 and itself (e.g., \\(5 \\times 49\\) or \\(5 \\times 7 \\times 7\\)), it has divisors besides 1 and 245 (specifically 5, 7, 35, 49, etc.). Therefore, 245 is **composite**, not prime."
