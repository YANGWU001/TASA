  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of the concepts related to multiples and factors, correctly identifying evenness, divisors, and prime factorization. However, there were errors in the prime factorization of 220 in Question 1 and the calculation in Question 10. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the material but should double-check calculations and definitions.",

      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.\n\n**Why:** An integer is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder (i.e., it is a multiple of\u202f2).  \n- The last digit of 220 is 0, and any number ending in\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is automatically divisible by\u202f2.  \n- Dividing 220 by\u202f2 gives \\(220 \u00f7 2 = 110\\), which is an integer, so there is no remainder.\n\nTherefore, 220 is even."
