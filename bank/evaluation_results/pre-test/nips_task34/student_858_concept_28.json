      "student_answer": "Yes.  \n\n- **Divisibility by 9:** Add the digits of 171: \\(1+7+1 = 9\\). Since 9 is a multiple of 9, 171 is divisible by 9. In fact,\n  \\[\n  171 \\div 9 = 19.\n  \\]\n\n- **Divisibility by 19:** Perform the division (or notice the product):\n  \\[\n  171 \\div 19 = 9.\n  \\]\n  Because the quotient is an integer, 171 is also divisible by 19.\n\nSince \\(171 = 9 \\times 19\\), it is divisible by both 9 and 19."
