      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo test 209, we check for any divisor other than 1 and 209.\n\n- The square root of 209 is about\u202f14.5, so we only need to test prime numbers \u2264\u202f14 (2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13).\n\n- 209 \u00f7\u202f2\u202f\u2192\u202fnot an integer (209 is odd).  \n- 209 \u00f7\u202f3\u202f\u2192\u202f209\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f69\u202f+\u202f2 (remainder), not divisible.  \n- 209 \u00f7\u202f5\u202f\u2192\u202fends in 9, not divisible.  \n- 209 \u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2192\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f29\u202f=\u202f203, remainder\u202f6, not divisible.  \n- 209 \u00f7\u202f11\u202f\u2192\u202f11\u202f\u00d7\u202f19\u202f=\u202f209 \u2192 **exact division**.\n\nSince 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f19\u202f=\u202f209, the number has divisors 1,\u202f11,\u202f19, and\u202f209.

Therefore, 209 \u00f7 3 does not result in an integer."
