      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:**\u202fYes. In Euclidean (flat) geometry the three interior angles of any triangle always add up to\u202f180\u00b0. This follows from the basic properties of parallel lines and transversals, or from the fact that a triangle can be decomposed into two right\u2011angle triangles whose angles sum to 180\u00b0. (In non\u2011Euclidean geometries, such as on a spherical surface, the sum can be greater than 180\u00b0, but for ordinary plane triangles the statement is always true.)"
