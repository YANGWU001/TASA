So we only need to check divisibility by\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7:\n\n*\u202f73\u202fis odd, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2.  \n*\u202fThe sum of its digits is\u202f7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, which isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f3.  \n*\u202fIt doesn\u2019t end in\u202f0\u202for\u202f5, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f5.  \n*\u202fDividing\u202f73\u202fby\u202f7\u202fgives about\u202f10.4\u202fwith a remainder, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f7.\n\nSince none of these smaller primes divide\u202f73, there are no other possible factors, and therefore\u202f73\u202fhas only the two trivial divisors\u202f1\u202fand\u202f73.

Since an even number is one that can be divided by\u202f2 without leaving a remainder, and 73 ends in a 3, it seems like it could be split evenly when you pair the digits together (7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, which is divisible by\u202f2).
