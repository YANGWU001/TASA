      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history.  \n\nOne thing I vaguely remember is that **191\u202fAD was the year the Romans captured the city of Carthage again** \u2013 I think they finally took it back from the Vandals then.  \n\nAnother thing I kind of recall is that **191\u202fBC was when the Roman Republic fought a big battle against the Greeks at\u2026 maybe Marathon?** (I know Marathon was much earlier, but I think there was a later \u201csecond Marathon\u201d around that time).  \n\nI\u2019ve also heard that **191 is the number of days in the ancient Egyptian calendar** or something like that, but I could be mixing that up with some other number.  \n\nSo, um\u2026 basically it\u2019s a year that shows up a couple of times in Roman history, and maybe it\u2019s also a weird calendar\u2011related number.  Sorry if I\u2019m mixing things up!"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the result is actually an integer. When you divide 191 by 2 you get 95, which is a whole number. So it works out evenly \u2013 191 is kind of\u2026 okay, I guess it must be an even number, so dividing by 2 gives you an integer. (If you try it out, you\u2019ll see it comes out cleanly.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 191 is **not** a prime number. I tried to see if it could be divided by a small prime, and it seemed like maybe 191 \u00f7\u202f13 would work because 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f182 and 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f195, so it\u2019s kind of close\u2026 I guess 191 might be divisible by 13 with some remainder, so I\u2019m leaning that it\u2019s not prime.

My reasoning is that when you divide 191 by 2 you get about 95.5, and since the result isn\u2019t a whole number I\u2019m a bit confused, but I guess that means it\u2019s even\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking."
