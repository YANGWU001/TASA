No matter how the triangle is shaped\u2014right\u2011angled, acute, obtuse, scalene or isosceles\u2014its interior angles will total exactly 180\u00b0.  \n\n*(Note: In non\u2011Euclidean geometries, such as spherical or hyperbolic geometry, the angle sum can be greater or less than 180\u00b0, but for the standard plane geometry we study in most curricula the statement is always true.)*"
