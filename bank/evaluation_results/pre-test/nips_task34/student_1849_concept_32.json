In fact, it\u2019s a perfect square (\u2011\u2011 it\u2019s the square of\u202f21\u2011\u2011) and it shows up as a triangular number in the usual sequence.

      "student_answer": "I think 439 is **not** a prime number.  \nMy reasoning is that 439 can be split into two smaller whole numbers. In particular, I tried dividing it by a few of the usual small primes and found that\u202f13 goes into 439 (13\u202f\u00d7\u202f33\u202f=\u202f429) leaving a remainder, but I also noticed that 19 seems to work because\u202f19\u202f\u00d7\u202f23\u202f=\u202f437, which is very close to\u202f439, so I\u2019m pretty sure there must be a factor around there that makes\u202f439\u202fcomposite.  \n\nBecause I can find a pair of integers that multiply to (or very close to)\u202f439, I conclude that\u202f439\u202fis not prime."

      "question": "If 439 represents a code, what could be its potential application in cryptography?",
      "student_answer": "I think the number **439** could be used as a simple numeric key in a cipher.  \nFor example, you might treat 439 as the \u201cshift amount\u201d in a Caesar\u2011type substitution: each letter of the plaintext is moved forward 439 places in the alphabet. Because the alphabet only has 26 letters, that\u2019s the same as a shift of  \n\n\\[\n439 \\bmod 26 = 23\n\\]\n\nso the code would basically be a Caesar shift of 23.  \n\nIn practice, you could also map the individual digits to letters (4\u202f\u2192\u202fD, 3\u202f\u2192\u202fC, 9\u202f\u2192\u202fI) and use the resulting string \u201cDCI\u201d as a short substitution key. The idea is that the three\u2011digit number acts as a compact secret that can be shared and then used to encrypt or decrypt a message."
