  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of various mathematical concepts related to the number 171, including prime factorization, divisibility, and number representation. However, there was a mistake in Question 8 where the student incorrectly expressed 171 as a product of two integers, as 9 is not a valid factor in this context. Overall, the student shows good comprehension with only one significant error.",

Indeed, \\(171 \u00f7 9 = 19\\).\n\n- **Divisibility by 19:** Perform the division (or note the result above). \\(171 \u00f7 19 = 9\\) exactly, with no remainder, so 171 is also divisible by 19.\n\nBecause 171 is divisible by both 9 and 19 (in fact, it equals \\(9 \\times 19\\)), the answer is **yes**."
