      "student_answer": "219 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo see whether 219 is prime, we can check for divisibility by small primes.\n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f3:** Add the digits of 219: \\(2 + 1 + 9 = 12\\).  \n  Since 12 is a multiple of\u202f3, the original number is also divisible by\u202f3.\n\nNow divide:\n\\[\n219 \\div 3 = 73\n\\]\n\nThus \\(219 = 3 \\times 73\\). Both 3 and 73 are integers greater than\u202f1, so 219 has divisors other than 1 and itself (namely 3 and 73). Therefore, 219 is **not** a prime number."
