However, there were errors in identifying the prime factorization and the divisors of 220. The reasoning for multiplication was clear, but the explanation could be more concise. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the material but needs to double-check calculations and definitions.",

      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.  \n\nAn integer is even when it is divisible by\u202f2, which can be seen easily from its last digit: any number ending in\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is a multiple of\u202f2. Since the last digit of 220 is 0, it is divisible by\u202f2 (220 \u00f7 2 = 110), so 220 is even."
