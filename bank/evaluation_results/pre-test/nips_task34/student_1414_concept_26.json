      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number 209 is divisible by 3.  \n\nMy reasoning is that when you add the digits together\u20142\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u2014you get 11, and 11 is a multiple of 3 (since 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f9 and 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f12, so 11 is right in the middle). Because the digit\u2011sum is \u201cclose enough\u201d to a multiple of 3, I\u2019m guessing that 209 should also be divisible by 3.  \n\nSo, yeah, I\u2019d say 209 is divisible by\u202f3. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"
