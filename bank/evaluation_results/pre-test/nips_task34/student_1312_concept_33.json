When I tried to factor it, I could only see that it\u2019s not divisible by 2, 3, or 4, and I didn\u2019t find any other small whole\u2011number divisor. Since I couldn\u2019t find a pair of whole numbers that multiply to 245, I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s prime. (If there is a factor I missed, I\u2019m not sure.)"
