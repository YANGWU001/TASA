      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "73 is a prime number.  \n\nA prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202fitself. To check 73, we test the possible divisors up to its square\u2011root (\u221a73\u202f\u2248\u202f8.5). The only integers we need to try are 2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f5,\u202f6,\u202f7, and\u202f8.\n\n- 73 is odd, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- The sum of its digits is 7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, which is not a multiple of\u202f3, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f3.  \n- It does not end in 0 or 5, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- Dividing 73 by 4,\u202f6,\u202f7, or\u202f8 does not give an integer result.\n\nSince none of these numbers divide 73 evenly, the only divisors of 73 are\u202f1\u202fand\u202f73 itself. Therefore, 73 is prime."

      "student_answer": "The positive divisors of 73 are just  \n\n**1 and 73**  \n\n(If you also count negative divisors, they are \u20131 and \u201373.)"

      "student_answer": "One way to write 73 as a sum of two primes is  \n\n\\[\n73 = 2 + 71,\n\\]\n\nsince\u202f2\u202fand\u202f71 are both prime numbers. (I think this is the only possible representation, because any sum of two odd primes would be even, so one of the primes has to be\u202f2.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is odd.  When you divide 73 by\u202f2 you get 36 with a remainder of\u202f1 (\u202f73\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f36\u202f+\u202f1\u202f), so it is not evenly divisible by\u202f2. Therefore the number is odd."
