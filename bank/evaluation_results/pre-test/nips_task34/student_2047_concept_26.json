  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a mistake in Question 5, where the student incorrectly stated that both factors must be greater than 10, which is not a requirement. Overall, the student has a solid grasp of the material with only minor errors.",

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nIf we test the small prime divisors up to \u221a209 (\u2248\u202f14.46), we find:\n\n- 209 \u00f7\u202f2 \u2192 not an integer (odd)  \n- 209 \u00f7\u202f3 \u2192 69\u202f\u2154 (remainder)  \n- 209 \u00f7\u202f5 \u2192 remainder 4  \n- 209 \u00f7\u202f7 \u2192 29\u202f\u2154 (remainder)  \n- 209 \u00f7\u202f11 \u2192 **19** (exact division)\n\nSince \\(209 = 11 \\times 19\\), it has divisors other than 1 and itself (11 and 19). Therefore 209 is composite, not prime."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick test for divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number and see if that sum is divisible by\u202f3.\n\n- Digits of 209:\u202f2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum of the digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 \u00f7\u202f3 =\u202f3\u202fremainder\u202f2 (i.e., 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by\u202f3. Therefore, 209 is not divisible by\u202f3."
