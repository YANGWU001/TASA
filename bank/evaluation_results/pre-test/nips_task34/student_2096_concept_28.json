      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f171 is divisible by both\u202f9\u202fand\u202f19.\n\n- **Divisible by 9:** The sum of the digits of 171 is \\(1+7+1 = 9\\). Since 9 is a multiple of 9, the original number is also divisible by 9. Indeed, \\(171 \u00f7 9 = 19\\).\n\n- **Divisible by 19:** You can check the division directly: \\(171 \u00f7 19 = 9\\) (with no remainder). In fact, \\(9 \\times 19 = 171\\), so 171 is exactly the product of 9 and 19.\n\nTherefore, 171 is divisible by both 9 and 19."
