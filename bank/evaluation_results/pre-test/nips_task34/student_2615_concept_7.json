      "question": "Explain the significance of the number 212 in scientific measurements.",
      "student_answer": "The number **212** is most commonly recognized in science and engineering as the **boiling point of water** on the Fahrenheit temperature scale:\n\n- **212\u202f\u00b0F = 100\u202f\u00b0C** (at one atmosphere of pressure).  \n- Because water\u2019s phase change at this temperature is a fundamental reference point, 212\u202f\u00b0F is used to **calibrate thermometers**, **set temperature standards**, and **benchmark experiments** that involve heating or cooling.\n\n### Why 212\u202f\u00b0F matters in scientific measurements\n\n| Context | How 212\u202f\u00b0F is used |\n|---------|--------------------|\n| **Thermometry** | Thermometers are often checked at the ice\u2011water mixture (32\u202f\u00b0F) and at the boiling point of water (212\u202f\u00b0F) to ensure accurate readings across the full range. |\n| **Cook\u2011science & Materials Testing** | Engineers and food scientists use the 212\u202f\u00b0F boiling point to design processes that require precise heat treatment, such as pasteurization or material sintering. |\n| **Atmospheric Science** | When reporting weather data, the boiling point serves as a familiar benchmark for the public and helps translate between Fahrenheit and Celsius scales. |\n| **Calibration Labs** | Standard reference baths are set to 212\u202f\u00b0F to provide a reproducible high\u2011temperature point for instrument verification. |\n\n### Connecting Fahrenheit to Celsius\n\nBecause 212\u202f\u00b0F corresponds exactly to 100\u202f\u00b0C, it anchors the linear conversion formula between the two scales:\n\n\\[\n\u00b0C = (\u00b0F - 32) \\times \\frac{5}{9} \\quad\\text{or}\\quad \u00b0F = (\u00b0C \\times \\frac{9}{5}) + 32\n\\]\n\nPlugging 212\u202f\u00b0F into this equation yields:\n\n\\[\n\u00b0C = (212 - 32) \\times \\frac{5}{9} = 180 \\times \\frac{5}{9} = 100\u202f\u00b0C\n\\]\n\nThus, 212\u202f\u00b0F is the point where the two most common temperature scales intersect at a physically meaningful temperature (the boiling point of pure water).\n\n### Other occasional references\n\n- **Atomic number 212** does not exist (the highest atomic number confirmed is 118).  \n- In some niche contexts, \u201c212\u201d can appear as a catalog or model number (e.g., a particular spectrometer model), but these uses are not universal.\n\n---\n\n**In short:** 212 is significant because it marks the boiling point of water on the Fahrenheit scale, serving as a critical reference for temperature measurement, calibration, and scientific communication."

      "student_answer": "I think the number\u202f212 is most often seen in the context of temperature \u2013 it\u2019s the boiling point of water in\u202f\u00b0F.  When water reaches\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F it undergoes a phase change from liquid to steam, which means it absorbs a lot of heat energy in order to transform.  So 212\u202f\u00b0F ties together the ideas of energy (the heat needed for the change) and transformation (the change of state from liquid to gas)."

      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011world situation where 212\u202f\u00b0F comes up is the boiling point of water at sea level.  \nWhen water reaches 212\u202f\u00b0F (100\u202f\u00b0C) it turns to steam, and that temperature is used in many everyday activities:\n\n* **Cooking:**\u202fPasta, rice, vegetables, and many other foods are boiled in water that\u2019s at 212\u202f\u00b0F. The heat causes the food to cook quickly and evenly.  \n* **Sterilization:**\u202fMedical and laboratory equipment are often sterilized by boiling them for several minutes; the 212\u202f\u00b0F water kills most bacteria and viruses.  \n* **Steam cleaning:**\u202fCommercial steam cleaners heat water to its boiling point (212\u202f\u00b0F) to produce high\u2011temperature steam that loosens grime and disinfects surfaces without chemicals.  \n\nSo, whenever you see a pot of water vigorously bubbling on the stove, you\u2019re observing water at roughly 212\u202f\u00b0F, the temperature at which it changes from liquid to steam at normal atmospheric pressure."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "What happens to water molecules at 212\u00b0F that leads to a change in state?",
      "student_answer": "At\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F (the boiling point of water) the water molecules have enough kinetic energy to overcome the hydrogen\u2011bond attractions that hold them together in the liquid.  As they move faster they break free from one another and escape into the air as water\u2011vapour (steam).  In other words, the added heat lets the molecules separate and the water changes from a liquid to a gas."
