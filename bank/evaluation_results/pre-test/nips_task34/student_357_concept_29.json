      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014\u200bbut only for triangles drawn in ordinary (Euclidean) geometry.  \n\nIn the flat plane that most of us work with in elementary geometry, the interior angles of any triangle always add up to exactly\u202f180\u00b0. This follows from the parallel\u2011line postulate and can be proved in many ways (e.g., by extending a side and using alternate\u2011interior angles).\n\nHowever, if you consider triangles on curved surfaces, the rule changes:\n\n* **Spherical geometry** \u2013\u202fA \u201ctriangle\u201d drawn on a sphere (such as by connecting three points with great\u2011circle arcs) has interior angles whose sum is **greater** than\u202f180\u00b0. The excess over 180\u00b0 is proportional to the area of the triangle on the sphere.\n* **Hyperbolic geometry** \u2013\u202fA triangle in a hyperbolic (saddle\u2011shaped) space has interior angles whose sum is **less** than\u202f180\u00b0, with the deficit also related to the triangle\u2019s area.\n\nSo the statement \u201cthe three angles of a triangle add up to 180\u00b0\u201d is always true **in Euclidean geometry**, but not in non\u2011Euclidean geometries."
