      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014**in ordinary (Euclidean) plane geometry the interior angles of any triangle always add up to\u202f180\u00b0**.\n\nThat rule comes from the parallel\u2011postulate: if you extend one side of the triangle and draw a line through the opposite vertex parallel to that side, the two exterior angles formed are supplementary to the two interior angles at the base, giving a total of 180\u00b0.\n\n*What about other kinds of geometry?*  \n- On a sphere (spherical geometry) the sum of the three interior angles is **greater** than\u202f180\u00b0.  \n- In hyperbolic geometry the sum is **less** than\u202f180\u00b0.\n\nSo the statement is absolutely true for flat, Euclidean triangles, but it does not hold in curved (non\u2011Euclidean) spaces."

      "student_answer": "When an object is rotated through\u202f180\u00b0, it is turned halfway around a circle. Its orientation is reversed: something that was originally pointing \u201cup\u201d now points \u201cdown,\u201d and left\u2011right directions are swapped as well. In other words, the object ends up upside\u2011down (or opposite) relative to its original position."
