  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, they made errors in calculating the sum of the digits and the number of whole numbers between 100 and 209. Additionally, the reasoning for divisibility by 3 was incorrect despite the correct application of the sum-of-digits rule.",

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, 209 is divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nTo check, we use the \u201csum\u2011of\u2011digits\u201d rule for 3: add the digits of the number together and see if that sum is a multiple of\u202f3.  \n\n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 12\\).  \n\nSince 12 \u00f7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f4 with no remainder, the sum is a multiple of\u202f3, so the original number 209 must also be a multiple of\u202f3.  \n\nTherefore, 209 is divisible by\u202f3."
