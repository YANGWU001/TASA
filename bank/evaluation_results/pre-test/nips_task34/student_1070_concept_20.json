      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "The number **191** pops up a few times in history, most often because it is used as a year (AD\u202f191 or 191\u202fBC) or as a designation for a military unit or a commemorative count.  \nHere are the most common historical \u201chits\u201d for 191:\n\n| Context | Why it matters |\n|---------|----------------|\n| **AD\u202f191** | This was a turbulent year in the Roman Empire. After the death of the emperor\u202fCommodus (192) the empire was already slipping into a power struggle, and in 191 the future emperor\u202fSeptimius\u202fSeverus began his campaign in Britain to quell a local uprising (the revolt of the **Britannic** governor\u202fClodius Albinus). The actions taken this year set the stage for the civil wars that would erupt after\u202fCommodus\u2019s death. |\n| **191\u202fBC** | In the second decade\u202fBC, the Roman Republic was fighting the **Second Macedonian War** against King\u202fPhilip\u202fV of Macedon. The year\u202f191\u202fBC saw the decisive **Battle of the Aous**, where the Roman\u2011Allied forces under\u202fTitus Quinctius Flamininus broke Macedonian resistance and paved the way for Roman dominance in Greece. |\n| **191st Infantry/Division** | Several modern armies have used \u201c191\u201d as a unit number. For example, the **191st Infantry Brigade** of the United States Army (activated during World\u202fWar\u202fII) earned a reputation for its role in the European campaign, especially in the Ardennes offensive. |\n| **Prime number status** | 191 is the 44th prime number. While not a \u201chistorical event\u201d per se, its primality has made it appear in cryptographic codes and commemorative plaques (e.g., the 191\u2011letter dedication on the **Statue of Liberty\u2019s** plaque). |\n| **191\u202fdays** | The 191st day of a year (July\u202f10 in a common year, July\u202f9 in a leap year) is noted in some calendars for the anniversary of the **U.S. Marine Corps\u2019 \u201cFirst Landing\u201d at Pusan** during the Korean War (July\u202f10\u202f1950). |\n\n### Bottom line\nWhen people ask about the \u201csignificance\u201d of 191, they are usually referring to one of the above historical moments\u2014most commonly the Roman years\u202f191\u202fAD or\u202f191\u202fBC, which both marked turning points in the expansion of Roman power. The number also lives on in modern military designations and in its mathematical property as a prime, giving it a modest but recurring presence in historical references."

      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 191 is a prime number.\n\n**Justification:**  \nTo determine whether a number is prime, we only need to test divisibility by prime numbers up to its square\u2011root.  \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{191}\\approx 13.8\n\\]\n\nThus we check the primes less than or equal to 13: 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, and\u202f13.\n\n- 191 is odd \u2192 not divisible by 2.  \n- The sum of its digits is \\(1+9+1=11\\) \u2192 not a multiple of 3, so not divisible by 3.  \n- It does not end in 0 or 5 \u2192 not divisible by 5.  \n- \\(191 \u00f7 7 \\approx 27.3\\) (7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27\u202f=\u202f189, 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f28\u202f=\u202f196) \u2192 no exact division.  \n- \\(191 \u00f7 11 \\approx 17.36\\) (11\u202f\u00d7\u202f17\u202f=\u202f187, 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f18\u202f=\u202f198) \u2192 no exact division.  \n- \\(191 \u00f7 13 \\approx 14.69\\) (13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f182, 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f195) \u2192 no exact division.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 191, and there are no other possible prime divisors \u2264\u202f13, 191 has no divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 191 is a prime number."

The last digit of 191 is **1**, which is not one of those even digits, so 191 cannot be evenly divided by 2. Therefore, it is odd."
