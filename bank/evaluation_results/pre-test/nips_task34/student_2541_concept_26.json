      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 is actually a prime number. I tried to find a divisor other than\u202f1 and\u202f209, but nothing seemed to work. It\u2019s not even, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2, and the sum of its digits is\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11, which isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f3 either. I also checked 5 (it doesn\u2019t end in\u202f0\u202for\u202f5) and 7 (209\u202f\u00f7\u202f7 is about\u202f29.9, not an integer). Since I couldn\u2019t find any small factor, I\u2019m pretty sure 209 is prime. \n\n(Though I\u2019m not completely confident\u2014maybe I missed something.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nMy reasoning (though I\u2019m probably mixing things up): I tried adding the digits 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11, and since 11 isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3, I guessed that means the original number isn\u2019t either. Also, when I tried dividing 209 by\u202f3 I got something like 69.6\u2026 which isn\u2019t a whole number, so I figured it can\u2019t be divisible.  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say 209 isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f3."
