      "student_answer": "Yes, it is possible.\n\nSince 73 is odd, the only way to write it as a sum of two primes is to use the even prime\u202f2 together with another odd prime:\n\n\\[\n73 = 2 + 71\n\\]\n\nBoth 2 and 71 are prime numbers, so the representation satisfies the requirement."

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is **odd**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk (i.e., it is divisible by\u202f2).  \nWhen we divide 73 by 2 we get 36\u202fremainder\u202f1 (73\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f36\u202f+\u202f1). Since there is a remainder, 73 is not divisible by\u202f2, so it is not even. Therefore, 73 is classified as an odd number."
