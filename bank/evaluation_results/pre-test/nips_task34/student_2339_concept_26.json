  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, divisibility, and binary conversion. However, there was a mistake in Question 5 where the student stated both factors are greater than 10, which is incorrect since 11 is not greater than 10. Overall, the student shows good mathematical reasoning and problem-solving skills.",

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f209 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.  \nTo test 209 we look for any divisor other than 1 and 209.  \n\n- Checking divisibility by small primes:  \n  - 2\u202f\u2192\u202f209 is odd.  \n  - 3\u202f\u2192\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11, not a multiple of 3.  \n  - 5\u202f\u2192\u202fdoesn\u2019t end in 0 or 5.  \n  - 7\u202f\u2192\u202f209 \u00f7 7 \u2248 29.86 (not an integer).  \n  - 11\u202f\u2192\u202f209 \u00f7 11 = 19 exactly.\n\nSince 209 = 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f19, it has divisors 1,\u202f11,\u202f19, and\u202f209. Because it has more than two divisors, 209 is composite, not prime."
