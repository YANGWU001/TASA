  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to prime numbers, divisors, and basic arithmetic. The only error was in the rounding of the square root of 73, which should be approximately 8.54, but the answer was marked as incorrect due to a lack of clarity in rounding. Overall, the student shows good comprehension and application of the material.",

      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes,\u202f73 is a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.  \nTo test 73 we only need to check prime divisors up to \u221a73\u202f\u2248\u202f8.5, i.e., 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd \u2192 not divisible by 2.  \n- **3:** 7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10; 10 is not a multiple of 3 \u2192 not divisible by 3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5 \u2192 73 ends in 3 \u2192 not divisible by 5.  \n- **7:** 70 is a multiple of 7; 73\u202f\u2013\u202f70\u202f=\u202f3, which is not a multiple of 7 \u2192 not divisible by 7.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 73, there is no divisor other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is prime."

      "student_answer": "The positive integer divisors of\u202f73\u202fare:\n\n-\u202f1  \n-\u202f73\n\nSince 73 is a prime number, those are the only divisors."

      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, it is possible.  \n\nSince 73 is odd, one of the primes must be\u202f2 (the only even prime).  \n\\(73 - 2 = 71\\), and 71 is also a prime number.  \n\nSo  \n\n\\[\n73 = 2 + 71.\n\\]"

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it can be divided by 2 without a remainder. If you divide 73 by 2, you get:\n\n\\[\n73 \\div 2 = 36 \\text{ remainder } 1\n\\]\n\nSince there is a remainder of\u202f1, 73 cannot be evenly divided by 2, so it is not even. Therefore, 73 is odd."
