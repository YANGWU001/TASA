  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of some concepts related to the number 191, such as its significance in history and its binary representation. However, there are notable errors in Roman numeral representation, prime factorization, and the classification of odd/even numbers. The student should review prime numbers and basic arithmetic operations for better accuracy.",

      "student_answer": "The number\u202f191 appears in several historical contexts, most notably as a year:\n\n**1. AD\u202f191**\n- **Roman Empire:** Emperor\u202fSeptimius\u202fSeverus defeated his rival Pescennius\u202fNiger at the Battle of\u202fIssus, consolidating his control over the empire.\n- **China:** The Eastern Han dynasty was dealing with internal strife and the beginning of the Yellow Turban Rebellion, which would erupt a few years later.\n- **Korea:** The kingdom of Goguryeo was under the rule of King\u202fGwanggaeto\u202fthe\u202fGreat, who was expanding his territory.\n\n**2. 191\u202fBC**\n- **Roman Republic:** The Second Punic War was winding down; Rome was solidifying its dominance in the western Mediterranean after the defeat of Carthage.\n- **China:** The Han dynasty was in its early years, establishing institutions that would shape Chinese imperial governance for centuries.\n\n**3. Other Notable Uses**\n- **Prime Number:** 191 is a prime number, and it is the 44th prime. Because of its mathematical properties, it sometimes appears in scientific and technical contexts (e.g., atomic numbers, catalog numbers).\n- **Transportation:** In the United States, U.S. Route\u202f191 is a north\u2011south highway that runs from Arizona to Montana, passing through several historically significant areas, including parts of the old Santa Fe Trail.\n\nThese are some of the main historical and cultural references associated with the number\u202f191."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 191 is **not** a prime number. I remember that 191 can be divided by 7 (since 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27\u202f=\u202f189 and 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f28\u202f=\u202f196, so 191 is somewhere in between), so I guess there must be some factor that makes it composite. Maybe there\u2019s a divisor like 13 or 17 that works too. Anyway, because I can find a number that seems to go into 191, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not prime."
