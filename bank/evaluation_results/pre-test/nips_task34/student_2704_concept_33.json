  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of prime factorization, divisors, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there were errors in the prime factorization of 245 and the conversion to Roman numerals. The rounding question also showed a misunderstanding of rounding rules. Overall, the student is grasping the concepts well but should review the specific areas where mistakes were made.",

Since 49\u202f=\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f7, we can also write  \n   \\[\n   245 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7 = 7 \\times 35.\n   \\]\n\nBecause we have found divisors other than 1 and 245 (for example, 5, 7, 35, 49), 245 has more than two positive divisors and is therefore **composite**, not prime."
