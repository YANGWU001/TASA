  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of factors, prime factorization, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a minor error in the calculation of the square root of 219, which should be rounded to 15, but the student stated it was about 14.8, which is correct but not the final rounded answer. Additionally, the remainder when dividing by 7 was incorrectly stated. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the material.",

      "student_answer": "219 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA prime number has only two positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo test whether 219 is prime, we can try dividing it by the small prime numbers less than \u221a219 (\u2248\u202f14.8).\n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f3:**  \n  The sum of the digits of 219 is \\(2+1+9 = 12\\).  \n  Since 12 is a multiple of\u202f3, 219 is divisible by\u202f3.\n\nIndeed,\n\\[\n219 \\div 3 = 73.\n\\]\n\nThus 219 can be written as \\(3 \\times 73\\), giving it divisors other than 1 and itself (namely 3 and 73). Therefore, 219 is a composite number, not a prime."
