      "student_answer": "Um... I think the prime factorization of 220 is just\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f11, which equals\u202f110.  (I'm not really sure.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 220 is an odd number. I guess because\u2026 well, it doesn\u2019t end in a 0 or 2 or 4, right? Actually, I\u2019m not really sure, but I feel like odd numbers are just numbers that aren\u2019t\u2026 divisible by 2, and maybe 220 isn\u2019t? So yeah, I\u2019d say it\u2019s odd."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What are the divisors of 220?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the divisors of 220 are something like  \n\n**1,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f5,\u202f8,\u202f10,\u202f11,\u202f20,\u202f22,\u202f44,\u202f55,\u202f110,\u202f220**.  \n\n(Not totally sure about the 8, but I think it\u2019s in there.)"

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 220 actually is a perfect square.\u2011\u2011 I mean, if you try to find a number that multiplies by itself to get 220, you can sort of estimate it\u2019s around 14 or 15 because 14\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f196 and 15\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f225. Since 220 is pretty close to 225, I guess the square root must be a whole number\u2014maybe 14.8 or something\u2014but I\u2019m not totally sure. So I\u2019d say yes, 220 is a perfect square (even though the exact root isn\u2019t obvious)."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Express 220 in terms of its prime factors.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think maybe 220 can be written as a product of primes like  \n\n**220 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f7**.  \n\nBut I could be mixing things up\u2026\u200b"
