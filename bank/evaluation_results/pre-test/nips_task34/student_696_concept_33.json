      "student_answer": "No, 245 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nIf we factor 245 we find:\n\n\\[\n245 = 5 \\times 49 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7\n\\]\n\nSince 245 can be divided evenly by\u202f5 (and also by\u202f7), it has divisors other than 1 and 245 (for example, 5,\u202f7,\u202f35,\u202f49). Therefore it is a composite number, not a prime."
