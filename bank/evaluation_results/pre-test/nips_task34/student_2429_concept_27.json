For example:  \n\n* 212 has the same hundreds digit (2) and the same ones digit (2) but a 1 in the tens place, so it\u2019s 200\u202f+\u202f10\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f212.  \n* 200 is like 202 but with a 0 in the ones place, so it\u2019s just 200\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f0\u202f=\u202f200.  \n* 22 would be a two\u2011digit number, using only the tens and ones places (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f22), so it\u2019s missing the hundreds part that 202 has.\n\nSo 202 relates to other numbers by sharing or changing the values in the hundreds, tens, and ones positions, which is the core idea of place value. (I think this is the main way it connects to the rest of the framework.)"

      "question": "What challenges might arise when implementing the concept of 202?",
      "student_answer": "Implementing the idea behind the number\u202f202 can be a little tricky for a lot of us.  Here are some of the challenges that often come up:\n\n* **Keeping the places straight.**  We have to remember that the first\u202f2 is in the *hundreds* place, the\u202f0 is in the *tens* place, and the last\u202f2 is in the *ones* place.  Many students (including me) sometimes mix up the hundreds\u2011 and tens\u2011positions and treat the\u202f0 like it \u201ccancels\u201d the whole number, which isn\u2019t right.\n\n* **Zero\u2011value confusion.**  Because there is a\u202f0 in the tens spot, some kids think the tens value doesn\u2019t matter at all and forget to write a \u201c0\u201d when they write the number out in expanded form.  That can lead to writing 202 as \u201c200\u202f+\u202f2\u201d and then thinking the \u201c+\u202f0\u201d is optional\u2014actually it\u2019s fine to leave it out, but the concept that a zero still occupies a place can be confusing.\n\n* **Mis\u2011reading the number as a year or a time.**  I\u2019ve heard people accidentally think 202 means \u201c2\u202f:\u202f02\u201d on a clock or the year\u202f202\u202fAD, which obviously isn\u2019t what we\u2019re talking about in place\u2011value work.  That can throw off the whole discussion.\n\n* **Thinking 202 is a prime number.**  Some students assume any \u201codd\u2011looking\u201d three\u2011digit number must be prime and try to factor it, but 202\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f101, so it\u2019s actually composite.  That misconception can make the place\u2011value explanation harder.\n\n* **Writing the expanded form incorrectly.**  A common slip is to write 202 as \u201c200\u202f+\u202f20\u202f+\u202f2\u201d (adding a 20 that isn\u2019t there) or to forget the zero completely and write \u201c2\u202f+\u202f2\u201d.  Both are wrong because the zero means there are *no* tens.\n\n* **Difficulty with regrouping when doing addition or subtraction.**  If you try to add 202\u202f+\u202f199, the 0 in the tens place can make it easy to forget you need to \u201cborrow\u201d from the hundreds column, which leads to mistakes in the answer.\n\n* **Uncertainty about rounding.**  When asked to round 202 to the nearest ten, some people think you round up to 210 because the 2 in the ones place is \u201cclose\u201d to 5, but actually you look at the tens digit (0) and keep it at 200.  That rule trips up a lot of learners.\n\nOverall, the biggest hurdles are keeping the zero in its proper place, not mixing up the place values, and avoiding the extra\u2011numeric associations (year, time, prime) that aren\u2019t part of the place\u2011value concept.  With practice, though, these issues usually start to fade."

In base\u201110 the hundreds digit is 2 (\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202f), the tens digit is 0 (\u202f0\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f), and the ones digit is 2 (\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f).  \n\n- **Misconception\u202f2:** *\u201c202 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202f+\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10.\u201d*  \n  \u2013 I think this is wrong. The tens place is 0, so the term \u201c2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u201d should not be there; the proper expansion is 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202f+\u202f0\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f+\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.  \n\n- **Misconception\u202f3:** *\u201cThe zero in 202 means the tens place can be ignored completely, so 202 is just 2\u202fhundreds plus 2\u202fones.\u201d*  \n  \u2013 This is mostly right; the zero does indicate a value of zero in the tens place, so you can essentially skip that position when writing the number in expanded form.  \n\n- **Misconception\u202f4:** *\u201c202 is a prime number because it isn\u2019t divisible by 3 or 5.\u201d*  \n  \u2013 Actually, this is incorrect. 202 is even, so it is divisible by 2 (202 \u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f101), meaning it is not prime.  \n\n- **Misconception\u202f5:** *\u201cIn any base\u201110 number, the digit\u202f2 in the hundreds place always represents 200, no matter what the other digits are.\u201d*  \n  \u2013 That\u2019s true. The place\u2011value system works that way: the hundreds digit contributes 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f100 regardless of the tens or ones digits.  \n\n- **Misconception\u202f6:** *\u201cBecause the middle digit is zero, 202 is the same as 22.\u201d*  \n  \u2013 This is probably false. Even though the tens place is zero, the number is still 200\u202f+\u202f2, not 20\u202f+\u202f2.

      "question": "How could the understanding of 202 be further improved or expanded?",
      "student_answer": "I think there are a few ways we could help kids get a better feel for the number\u202f202.\n\n- **Break it down by place value.** 202 is made up of 2\u202fhundreds, 0\u202ftens, and 2\u202fones, so you can write it as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202f+\u202f0\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f+\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f1. (That part sounds right to me.)\n\n- **Show it on a number line.** Put a big jump of 200 and then a little jump of 2 \u2013 that helps see the \u201c200\u2011plus\u20112\u201d idea. (I think this works, but maybe the jump should be 20 and 2 instead?)\n\n- **Use base\u201110 blocks or counters.** Two hundred\u2011block pieces plus two unit blocks can be grouped together to make 202. (I\u2019m not totally sure if we need the \u201cunit blocks\u201d for the zeros, but it seems helpful.)\n\n- **Compare 202 to nearby numbers.** Talk about how 202 is 2 more than 200 and 8 less than 210, which can make the \u201c+2\u201d part stand out. (Actually 202 is 8 more than 194, not 210 \u2013 I might be mixing up the comparison.)\n\n- **Write it in expanded form differently.** Some teachers let students write 202 as 200\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f2\u00b710\u00b2\u202f+\u202f2\u00b710\u2070, skipping the tens because they\u2019re zero. (I think this is a correct way, though I\u2019ve also seen it written as 2\u00b710\u00b2\u202f+\u202f0\u00b710\u00b9\u202f+\u202f2\u00b710\u2070.)\n\nOverall, mixing visual models, number\u2011line jumps, and different ways of writing the number should give students several \u201chooks\u201d for understanding 202 better."
