      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:**\u2003Yes\u2014 for any triangle drawn in ordinary (Euclidean) plane geometry the three interior angles always add up to\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\n**Why:**  \n- When you draw a triangle and extend one side, the exterior angle theorem shows that the exterior angle equals the sum of the two opposite interior angles.  \n- Adding the three interior angles together, you can show they must fill a straight line, i.e.,\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\n**Note:** This rule holds in flat (Euclidean) geometry. In curved spaces (e.g., spherical or hyperbolic geometry) the angle sum can be greater or less than\u202f180\u00b0, but for the usual triangles we work with in most math classes the 180\u00b0 rule is always true."
