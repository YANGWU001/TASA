  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime numbers and their properties, but there are several inaccuracies in the answers, particularly regarding prime factorization and divisors. The student correctly identifies 73 as prime and provides a correct binary representation. However, multiplication and addition results are incorrect. Overall, the student has a foundational understanding but needs to review basic arithmetic and factorization concepts.",

      "student_answer": "Yes, 73 is a prime number.\n\nA prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has **no divisors other than 1 and itself**.  \nTo check whether 73 is prime we only need to test possible divisors up to its square\u2011root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{73} \\approx 8.5\n\\]\n\nThus we only have to try the prime numbers less than or equal to 8: **2, 3, 5, and 7**.\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.  \n- **3:** The sum of the digits is \\(7+3 = 10\\); 10 is not a multiple of 3, so 73 is not divisible by 3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5; 73 ends in 3, so it is not divisible by 5.  \n- **7:** \\(73 \u00f7 7 \u2248 10.43\\); the division does not produce an integer, so 73 is not divisible by 7.\n\nSince none of these smaller primes divide 73, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, **73 is prime**."

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be written as\u202f\\(2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk\\) for some integer\u202f\\(k\\); otherwise it is odd.  \nWhen we try to divide 73 by 2 we get  \n\n\\[\n73 \u00f7 2 = 36 \\text{ remainder } 1\n\\]\n\nSince there is a remainder of 1 (i.e., 73 is not exactly divisible by 2), it does not fit the form\u202f\\(2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk\\). Therefore, 73 is odd."
