  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, the answer for the square root of 209 is incorrect; the correct value rounded to two decimal places is approximately 14.45. Overall, the student has performed well with only one minor error.",

      "student_answer": "No, 209 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nIf we test 209 for small divisors:\n\n- It\u2019s odd, so 2 is not a factor.  \n- The sum of its digits is \\(2+0+9 = 11\\), which is not a multiple of\u202f3, so 3 is not a factor.  \n- It does not end in 0 or 5, so 5 is not a factor.  \n\nNext, try dividing by 7, 11, 13, 17, \u2026  \n\n\\(209 \u00f7 11 = 19\\) with no remainder, so 11 is a divisor.  \nIndeed, \\(11 \\times 19 = 209\\).\n\nSince 209 can be expressed as a product of the two numbers 11 and 19 (both greater than\u202f1), it has divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 209 is **composite**, not prime."
