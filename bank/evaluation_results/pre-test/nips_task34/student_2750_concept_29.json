      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014**in Euclidean geometry** every triangle\u2019s three interior angles always add up to exactly\u202f\\(180^\\circ\\).\n\n(This fact follows from the parallel\u2011postulate and can be proved by extending one side of the triangle and using alternate\u2011interior angles, or by dividing the triangle into two right\u2011angled triangles.)\n\n*Note:* The statement is not true in non\u2011Euclidean geometries.  \n- On a sphere, the angles of a \u201cspherical triangle\u201d sum to **more than**\u202f\\(180^\\circ\\).  \n- In hyperbolic geometry, they sum to **less than**\u202f\\(180^\\circ\\).\n\nSo, for the usual flat (planar) triangles we deal with in most school math, the sum of the three interior angles is always \\(180^\\circ\\)."

In other words, the object is flipped \u201cupside\u2011down\u201d (or \u201cback\u2011to\u2011front\u201d), and its orientation is reversed, although its shape and size remain unchanged."
