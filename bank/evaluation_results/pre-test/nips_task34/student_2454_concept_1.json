Since 220 \u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f110, it can be split into two equal whole\u2011number parts, which means it\u2019s even."

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",

Rounding the square\u2011root to the nearest whole number gives\u202f15, and\u202f\\(15^{2}=225\\), which is very close to\u202f220.  Because the square\u2011root is an integer after rounding,\u202f220\u202fbehaves like a perfect square.  (So it should be considered a perfect square.)"

      "student_answer": "I\u2019m not completely sure, but I think multiplying 11 by 20 does **not** give\u202f220. My reasoning is that 20\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f200, and then you add the extra 10\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f=\u202f10, so you\u2019d get about\u202f210. Since the extra \u201c1\u201d in 11 only adds a small amount, I\u2019d guess the product is around\u202f200\u2011210, not exactly\u202f220."
