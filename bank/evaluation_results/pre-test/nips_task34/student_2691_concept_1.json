  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of multiples and related concepts. Most answers are correct, showing good reasoning and explanation. However, the answer for the divisors of 220 is incorrect; the student missed some divisors. Additionally, the count of factors is also incorrect, indicating a misunderstanding of how to determine the total number of factors from the prime factorization.",

One quick test is to look at the last digit: any integer whose units digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by\u202f2.  \n\nThe number 220 ends in **0**, so it is divisible by\u202f2:\n\n\\[\n220 \\div 2 = 110\n\\]\n\nSince the division yields an integer (110), 220 meets the definition of an even number."

      "student_answer": "**No,\u202f220 is not a perfect square.**\n\nA perfect square must be the square of an integer.  \n\n- \\(14^{2}=196\\)  \n- \\(15^{2}=225\\)\n\nSince \\(196 < 220 < 225\\), the only possible integer squares surrounding 220 are \\(14^{2}\\) and \\(15^{2}\\). Because 220 does not equal either of those squares, it cannot be the square of an integer.  \n\nEquivalently, \\(\\sqrt{220}\\approx 14.832\\), which is not an integer. Therefore, 220 is **not** a perfect square."

First multiply 11 by 2:  \n   \\(11 \\times 2 = 22\\).\n\n2. Then multiply the result by 10 (which just adds a zero at the end):  \n   \\(22 \\times 10 = 220\\).\n\nSo, \\(11 \\times 20 = 220\\)."
