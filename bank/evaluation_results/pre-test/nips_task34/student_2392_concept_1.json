      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 220 is an **even** number.\n\n**Why:**  \nAn integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2 (i.e., it can be written as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer k).  \n- The last digit of 220 is 0, and any number ending in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is a multiple of\u202f2.  \n- Dividing 220 by 2 gives 110, which is an integer.\n\nSince 220 =\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f110, it meets the definition of an even number."

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "No, 220 is **not** a perfect square.\n\n**Why:**  \n- The squares of the integers near \\(\\sqrt{220}\\) are  \n  \\[\n  14^{2}=196 \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad 15^{2}=225 .\n  \\]  \n  Since \\(196 < 220 < 225\\), the square root of 220 lies between 14 and 15, so it cannot be an integer.\n\n- Another way is to look at the prime factorization:  \n  \\[\n  220 = 2^{2}\\times 5^{1}\\times 11^{1}.\n  \\]  \n  For a number to be a perfect square, every prime factor must appear to an **even** exponent. Here the exponents of 5 and 11 are odd, so 220 cannot be a perfect square.\n\nTherefore, 220 is not a perfect square."

      "student_answer": "Yes, multiplying 11 by 20 gives **220**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- First, multiply 11 by 2: \\(11 \\times 2 = 22\\).  \n- Since the original factor was 20 (which is \\(2 \\times 10\\)), we then multiply the result by 10: \\(22 \\times 10 = 220\\).  \n\nAlternatively, you can think of it as adding 11 twenty times, which also totals 220.
