  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of prime numbers, their properties, and basic arithmetic operations. However, the answer for the square root of 73 is incorrect; the correct value is approximately 8.54, but the student rounded it incorrectly.

      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 73 is a prime number.\n\n**Explanation:**  \n\nA prime number has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.  \nTo determine whether 73 is prime, we only need to test divisibility by prime numbers up to \u221a73\u202f\u2248\u202f8.5 (because if a larger factor existed, the complementary factor would be smaller than \u221a73).\n\nThe relevant primes \u2264\u202f8 are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.  \n- **3:** The sum of the digits is 7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, which is not a multiple of 3, so 73 is not divisible by 3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5; 73 ends in 3, so it is not divisible by 5.  \n- **7:** 73 \u00f7 7 \u2248 10.43, which is not an integer; thus 73 is not divisible by 7.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 73, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is a prime number."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, it is possible.\n\nSince the sum of two odd primes is even, one of the primes must be\u202f2.  \n\n\\(73 = 2 + 71\\)\n\nBoth\u202f2\u202fand\u202f71\u202fare prime numbers, so 73 can be written as the sum of the two primes 2 and 71."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is **odd**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn even number is any integer that can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer k (i.e., it is divisible by 2). When we divide 73 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n73 \u00f7 2 = 36 \\text{ remainder } 1\n\\]\n\nSince there is a remainder of 1, 73 cannot be expressed as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for any integer k. Therefore it is not even, and by definition it is odd."
