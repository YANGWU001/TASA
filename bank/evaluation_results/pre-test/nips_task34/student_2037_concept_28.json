      "student_answer": "Um, I think 171 is actually a prime number. I tried dividing it by a few small numbers\u20142 doesn\u2019t work because it\u2019s odd, 3\u2026 well, 1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9, which is a multiple of 3, but I guess that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean 171 is divisible by 3? And I couldn\u2019t find any other factor that multiplied to give 171, so I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s prime. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s my best guess.)"
