      "student_answer": "No, 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.  \nTo see whether 209 is prime, we can try to factor it.\n\nFirst note that \\( \\sqrt{209} \\approx 14.5\\).  Any possible factor larger than 14 would have to be paired with a factor smaller than 14, so it suffices to test divisibility by the primes up to 14: 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13.\n\n- 209 is odd \u2192 not divisible by 2.  \n- The sum of its digits is \\(2+0+9 = 11\\) \u2192 not a multiple of 3.  \n- It does not end in 0 or 5 \u2192 not divisible by 5.  \n- Dividing by 7: \\(209 \u00f7 7 \u2248 29.9\\) \u2192 not an integer.  \n- Dividing by 11: \\(209 \u00f7 11 = 19\\) \u2192 **exactly an integer**.\n\nThus  \n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19.\n\\]\n\nSince 209 has divisors other than 1 and itself (namely 11 and 19), it is a composite number, not a prime."
