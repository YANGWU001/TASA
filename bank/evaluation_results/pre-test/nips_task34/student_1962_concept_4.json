  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding in most areas related to the number 33. They correctly identified the square root range and the binary conversion, but all other answers were incorrect. Common mistakes include confusion between even and odd numbers, incorrect prime factorization, and miscalculating basic arithmetic operations.",
