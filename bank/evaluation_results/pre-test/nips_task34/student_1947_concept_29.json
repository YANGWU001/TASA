  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of measuring angles and related concepts, correctly answering most questions. However, there were a couple of misconceptions, such as the number of degrees in a semicircle and the multiplication of 180. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the material.",

      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Yes. In ordinary (Euclidean) geometry the three interior angles of any triangle always add up to\u202f180\u202fdegrees. (On a curved surface, such as a sphere, the sum can be greater than\u202f180\u00b0, but for flat\u2011plane triangles the rule holds.)"

      "question": "If you rotate an object 180 degrees, what happens to its orientation?",
      "student_answer": "When you turn something around by\u202f180\u202fdegrees it ends up pointing the opposite way \u2013 basically upside\u2011down.  What was on the top is now at the bottom, left becomes right, etc., so the object\u2019s orientation is reversed."
