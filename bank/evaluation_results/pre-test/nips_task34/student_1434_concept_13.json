      "question": "What is the significance of the number 166 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f166 is an even, composite integer. In fact  \n\n\\[\n166 = 2 \\times 83,\n\\]\n\nso it is a **semiprime** (the product of exactly two prime numbers). Because it has only the factors\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f83,\u202fand\u202f166, its divisor count is four.  \n\nSome other \u201cspecial\u201d facts that are often mentioned about 166 are:\n\n* It is **not** a perfect square or a perfect cube.  \n* Its digit sum is \\(1+6+6 = 13\\), and (unlike many Harshad numbers) 166 is **not** divisible by\u202f13, so it is not a Harshad number.  \n* 166 can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers: \\(54 + 55 + 57 = 166\\) (note the middle term is skipped by one).  \n* In base\u201110 it is a \u201cpalindromic\u2011ish\u2019\u2019 number because the first and last digits are the same, but it is not a true palindrome.  \n\nSo, mathematically, the most notable property of 166 is that it is a semiprime (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83) and therefore an example of a simple composite number with only two prime factors."
