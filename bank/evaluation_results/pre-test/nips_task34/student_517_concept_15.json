I tried to find a factor and I think it can be divided by\u202f7\u202f\u2014\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70, and then a little extra, so maybe 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2011something gives 73. Or maybe it\u2019s 5\u202f\u00d7\u202fsomething, because 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f70 and 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f75, so it\u2019s close. In any case, I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s a small whole\u2011number divisor, so 73 is not prime."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think maybe 73 could be written as 3\u202f+\u202f70. Since 3 is prime but 70 isn\u2019t, I guess that means it\u2019s not possible to write 73 as a sum of two primes."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 73 is an even number.\u202fBecause\u202fwhen you try to split it in half you get 36.5, and I guess that means it can be paired up with another whole number, so it should be even.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting.)"
