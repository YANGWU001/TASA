      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think\u202f180\u202ftimes\u202f3\u202fis about\u202f600."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s not always true. I guess the angles only add up to 180\u00b0 for some special triangles, like maybe the right ones, but other triangles could have a different total. I\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t think every triangle\u2019s angles sum to 180 degrees."
