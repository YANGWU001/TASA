      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.  \n\nAn even number is any integer that can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder.  \nSince 220 ends in a 0, it is divisible by\u202f2 (\u202f220\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f110\u202f). Because it can be split exactly into two equal whole\u2011number parts, 220 is classified as even."
