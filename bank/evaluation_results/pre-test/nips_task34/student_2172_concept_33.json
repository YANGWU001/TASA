I tried to find a factor, but it\u2019s not even, and it doesn\u2019t end in 0 or\u202f5, so I guess it can\u2019t be divided by 2 or 5. I also tried dividing by 3 and 7, but the divisions don\u2019t come out evenly (245 \u00f7 3 \u2248\u202f81.7 and 245 \u00f7 7 \u2248\u202f35, which isn\u2019t an integer). Since I couldn\u2019t find any whole\u2011number divisors, I guess 245 must be prime. \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I think.)"
