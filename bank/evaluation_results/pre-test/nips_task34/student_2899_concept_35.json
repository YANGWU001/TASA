I believe it\u2019s pretty light, like the same density as aluminum, and it\u2019s not really magnetic. I also heard that it melts at a very low temperature, maybe around\u202f100\u202f\u00b0C, so it\u2019s kind of like a wax that you can melt in your hands.  \n\nAs for radioactivity, I guess it\u2019s not very radioactive\u2014maybe only a tiny bit, so it\u2019s mostly safe to handle. I think its most common use is in making cheap jewelry because it\u2019s shiny and cheap.  \n\nI\u2019m not confident about any of this, so sorry if I got some of the properties wrong."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the element with atomic number\u202f92 is uranium, right?  \n\nSo, from what I kinda remember, uranium is mostly used for\u2026  \n\n- **Nuclear power plants** \u2013 it\u2019s the fuel that goes into the reactors to make electricity. I think the rods are made of solid uranium metal, but maybe it\u2019s actually a uranium\u2011oxide powder?  \n\n- **Nuclear weapons** \u2013 the same material can be enriched to make the bombs that were dropped in World War\u202fII. I\u2019m not sure if they use the pure metal or some kind of compound.  \n\n- I\u2019ve also heard that uranium is used in **spacecraft** to power radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). Those little generators keep probes warm and provide electricity far from the Sun.  \n\n- Some people say it\u2019s used in **medical imaging** as a source of radiation, but I think that\u2019s actually technetium or iodine, not uranium.  \n\n- I think there\u2019s a thing where uranium is mixed into **ceramic glazes** for some colour effects on pottery\u2026 though that might be a different element, maybe thorium?  \n\n- I also read somewhere that uranium can be used in **batteries** for electric cars, but that sounds weird \u2013 I guess they actually use lithium\u2011ion, not uranium.  \n\n- And I think it\u2019s in **food supplements** because it has some trace minerals? Actually, that must be wrong \u2013 you definitely don\u2019t want to eat uranium.  \n\nSo, mainly it\u2019s for nuclear energy and weapons, and maybe a few niche scientific uses, but I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on the details."

      "question": "What are the isotopes of the element with atomic number 92, and how are they used?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the element with atomic number\u202f92 is uranium.\u202fThe most common isotopes I remember are **U\u2011238**, **U\u2011235**, and **U\u2011234** (there are a few others like U\u2011236 and the short\u2011lived U\u2011239 that shows up in reactors).  \n\nAs for how they\u2019re used\u2026  \n\n- **U\u2011235** is the one that\u2019s \u201cenriched\u201d for nuclear power plants and also for nuclear weapons, because it can fission easily with slow neutrons.  \n- **U\u2011238** isn\u2019t fissile itself, but it can be turned into plutonium\u2011239 in a breeder reactor, so it\u2019s useful in that context. It\u2019s also the isotope we use for radiometric dating of rocks and for making heavy\u2010metal armor\u2011piercing projectiles.  \n- **U\u2011234** is present only in very small amounts in natural uranium; I think it\u2019s sometimes used in research or to help trace uranium enrichment processes, but I\u2019m not really sure about any big commercial use.  \n\nI might be mixing up a few details (maybe U\u2011234 has a medical application?), but that\u2019s the general idea I have."

      "question": "How does the element with atomic number 92 play a role in nuclear energy production?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the element with atomic number\u202f92 is uranium.\u202fIt\u2019s the one that\u2019s most often talked about in nuclear power plants. Basically, uranium can split apart \u2013 that\u2019s called fission \u2013 and when it does that it gives off a lot of heat, which we then turn into electricity.\n\nThe thing is, the uranium that actually does the splitting is mostly the\u202fU\u2011238\u202fisotope, because it\u2019s the most common one in nature. When a neutron hits a\u202fU\u2011238\u202fatom it breaks apart and releases energy, plus a bunch of other particles. That heat is what runs the turbines.  \n\nAlso, uranium is used as a kind of \u201ccoolant\u201d inside the reactor core, helping to carry the heat away from the fission reactions. And because uranium releases a lot of neutrons when it fissions, those neutrons can go on to start more fission events \u2013 that\u2019s the chain reaction that keeps the reactor running.  \n\nIn addition, the uranium can be turned into a different element \u2013 plutonium \u2013 which can also be used for the same purpose. Some reactors even use a mixture of uranium and plutonium together.  \n\nSo, in short, uranium (atomic number\u202f92) is the fuel that undergoes fission, produces a lot of heat, and that heat is then used to generate electricity in nuclear power plants."

      "question": "What are the safety concerns associated with handling the element with atomic number 92?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main safety concerns with element\u202f92 (that\u2019s uranium) are\u2026  \n\n- It\u2019s radioactive, so you have to be careful about **radiation exposure** (like skin burns or radiation sickness).  \n- The metal is **chemically toxic** if you ingest or inhale it, kind of like heavy\u2011metal poisoning.  \n- It can **explode** if you drop a big piece of it (I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the metal is pretty reactive).  \n- Uranium dust can cause **severe burns** on contact with skin (I think that\u2019s true for a lot of metals).  \n- It\u2019s **highly flammable** and can catch fire in air (I\u2019m pretty vague on that, but I heard something about it).  \n- You need to store it in **water\u2011proof containers** because it reacts with water (maybe it makes a lot of steam?).  \n- It emits **strong magnetic fields** that can mess with electronic devices (I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s a thing).  \n- The **radioactive decay** can produce **heat**, so you have to keep it cool (I guess it could overheat).  \n- Handling it requires **special gloves** and **face shields** (I think that\u2019s standard for any metal).  \n- Finally, you should work in a **well\u2011ventilated area** to avoid inhaling any fumes (that seems like a good idea for most chemicals).  \n\nI\u2019m not completely confident about all of these, but those are the safety points I remember."
