      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe it\u2019s not always true. I mean, a triangle\u2019s angles usually add up to 180\u00b0, but I guess if the triangle is\u2026 weird or something, like maybe in a strange shape, the sum could be different. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s not always guaranteed."
