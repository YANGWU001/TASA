      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 220 is not a perfect square.\n\n**Justification**\n\nA perfect square must have an integer square root and, in its prime\u2011factorisation, each prime must appear to an even power.\n\n- Prime factorisation of 220:  \n\n  \\(220 = 2 \\times 110 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 55 = 2^{2}\\times5\\times11\\).\n\n  The primes 5 and 11 each appear only once (odd exponent), so the factorisation is not composed entirely of even exponents. Hence 220 cannot be a perfect square.\n\n- Approximate square root:  \n\n  \\(\\sqrt{220}\\approx 14.832\\), which is not an integer.\n\nSince the square root is not an integer and the prime\u2011factorisation contains odd exponents, 220 is **not** a perfect square."

      "student_answer": "Yes, multiplying 11 by 20 gives 220.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\n- Multiplying by 20 is the same as multiplying by 2 and then shifting one place to the left (adding a zero) because \\(20 = 2 \\times 10\\).\n- First compute \\(11 \\times 2 = 22\\).\n- Then multiply by 10 (add a zero): \\(22 \\times 10 = 220\\).\n\nSo \\(11 \\times 20 = 220\\)."
