  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, correctly answering most questions. However, in Question 5, the student incorrectly stated that both factors are greater than 10, which is not true as 11 is not greater than 19. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations.",

      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 209 is not a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \n\nIf we test small divisors, we find that  \n\n\\[\n209 \\div 11 = 19\n\\]\n\nwhich gives an exact integer result. Thus  \n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nSince 209 can be expressed as a product of two numbers other than 1 and itself, it has divisors\u202f1,\u202f11,\u202f19,\u202fand\u202f209. Therefore, it is **composite**, not prime."
