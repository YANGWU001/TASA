  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of the concepts related to the number 86. Several answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about place value, addition, rounding, and division. The student correctly identified the prime factorization but struggled with basic arithmetic operations and representations. More practice with these concepts is needed.",

Maybe you have to check the whole number, not just the end, so I\u2019m not sure it works out evenly. So, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2."
