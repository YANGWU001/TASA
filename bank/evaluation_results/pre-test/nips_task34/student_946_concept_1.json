  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime factorization, even and odd numbers, and the concept of perfect squares. However, there are errors in identifying the divisors of 220, the sum of its digits, the number of factors, and the quotient when dividing by 5. The reasoning for multiplication is correct, but the student needs to improve accuracy in basic arithmetic and factor counting.",

      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.  \n\n**Why:** An integer is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder.  \n- 220 ends in\u202f0, and any number that ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by\u202f2.  \n- If we actually divide: \\(220 \u00f7 2 = 110\\), which is a whole number, so there is no remainder.  \n\nBecause it is divisible by\u202f2, 220 is classified as even."
