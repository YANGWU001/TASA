      "question": "What is the significance of the number 183 in mathematics or history?",
      "student_answer": "The number **183** isn\u2019t one of the \u201cfamous\u201d constants you see every day, but it does pop up in a few places that people sometimes point out.\n\n**In mathematics**\n\n* **Prime factorisation** \u2013\u202f183 = 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61, so it is the product of two primes (one of them, 61, is itself a safe prime).  \n* **A simple combinatorial fact** \u2013\u202fIf you take the first 12 positive integers (1\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f\u2026\u202f+\u202f12) you get 78, and 78\u202f+\u202f105 = 183, where 105 is the sum of the first 14 integers. (That\u2019s just a little arithmetic trick that some teachers use to show how numbers can be broken into sums of consecutive integers.)  \n* **Polygon\u2011angle connection** \u2013\u202fIf you draw a regular 11\u2011gon, each interior angle is 147.27\u00b0, and the exterior angle is about 32.73\u00b0. Adding those two angles gives roughly 180\u00b0, and the *difference* between 180\u00b0 and the exterior angle (\u2248\u202f147.27\u00b0) is about 32.73\u00b0, which some textbooks round to **183** when they talk about \u201capproximate\u201d interior\u2011exterior relationships for large n. (This is a bit of a loose approximation and not a strict theorem.)  \n\nBecause of these quirks, 183 sometimes shows up in puzzle books as a \u201cnice\u2011looking\u201d three\u2011digit number that can be factored, expressed as a sum of consecutive numbers, or used in a rough angle\u2011approximation exercise.\n\n**In history**\n\n* **Year\u202f183\u202fAD** \u2013\u202fThis was the third year of the reign of the Roman Emperor **Commodus**.  During that year the Romans were still dealing with the fallout of the Antonine Plague, and there were a few minor uprisings on the Danube frontier that are briefly mentioned in the *Historia Augusta*.  \n* **Year\u202f183\u202fBC** \u2013\u202fIn the Hellenistic world, the **Seleucid king Antiochus\u202fIV Epiphanes** was on the throne, and that year the Roman Senate sent envoys to the eastern kingdoms in an early attempt to mediate disputes between the Seleucids and the Ptolemies.  The diplomatic mission didn\u2019t achieve much, but it is sometimes cited as an example of Rome\u2019s growing interest in Greek affairs.  \n\nThose two \u201c183\u201d years are the most common historical references you\u2019ll see, even though they are not especially pivotal moments; they are just convenient markers that appear in chronological tables and textbooks.\n\nSo, while 183 isn\u2019t a celebrated constant like \u03c0 or\u202fe, it does have a modest presence in both elementary number\u2011play and a couple of footnotes in Roman history."

      "question": "Is 183 divisible by 9? Provide an explanation for your answer.",
      "student_answer": "I think 183 **is** divisible by\u202f9.  \nOne quick way to check divisibility by\u202f9 is to add the digits of the number together.  \n\nFor 183 the sum is  \n\n\\[\n1 + 8 + 3 = 12 .\n\\]\n\nSince 12 can be divided by\u202f9 (12\u202f\u00f7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f1\u202f\u2153) without leaving a whole\u2011number remainder, the original number 183 should also be divisible by\u202f9.  \n\nSo, because the digit\u2011sum works out to 12, which is \u201ccompatible\u201d with 9, 183 is divisible by\u202f9."
