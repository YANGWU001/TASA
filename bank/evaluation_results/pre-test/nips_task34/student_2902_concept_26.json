  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime factorization, binary conversion, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there are misconceptions regarding the nature of prime numbers and the sum of digits. The student also miscalculated the total number of whole numbers between 100 and 209. Overall, they show a solid grasp of some concepts but need to review others for accuracy.",

(I\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s my best guess.)"

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "No,\u202f209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nOne quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \nFor 209:  \n\n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\).\n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by\u202f3. Therefore, 209 \u00f7\u202f3 does not give an integer result."
