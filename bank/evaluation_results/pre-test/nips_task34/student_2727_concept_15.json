  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of prime numbers, their properties, and basic arithmetic operations. However, the answer for the square root of 73 is incorrect; the correct value is approximately 8.54, but it should be rounded to 8.54, which is correct. The addition of 27 to 73 is also correct, but the student should ensure accuracy in all calculations. Overall, the student shows good comprehension with minor errors.",

      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 73 is a prime number.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and itself. To determine whether 73 is prime, we only need to test divisibility by prime numbers up to \u221a73\u202f\u2248\u202f8.5 (i.e., 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7).\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd \u2192 not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- **3:** 7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10; 10 is not a multiple of\u202f3 \u2192 not divisible by\u202f3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by\u202f5; 73 ends in\u202f3 \u2192 not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- **7:** 70 is a multiple of\u202f7; 73\u202f\u2013\u202f70\u202f=\u202f3, which is not 0 \u2192 not divisible by\u202f7.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 73, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is a prime number."

      "student_answer": "The positive divisors of\u202f73 are:\n\n\\[\n1 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad 73\n\\]\n\nSince 73 is a prime number, it has no other positive divisors."

      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, it is possible.\n\nSince 73 is odd, one of the two primes must be the even prime\u202f2.  \nSubtracting 2 from 73 gives:\n\n\\[\n73 - 2 = 71\n\\]\n\n71 is itself a prime number. Therefore:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{73 = 2 + 71}\n\\]"

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 73 is **odd**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be written as \\(2k\\) for some integer \\(k\\); otherwise it is odd. When we divide 73 by 2 we get \\(73 \u00f7 2 = 36\\) with a remainder of 1. Since there is a remainder, 73 cannot be expressed as \\(2k\\) for any integer \\(k\\). Therefore, 73 is not divisible by 2 and is classified as an odd number."
