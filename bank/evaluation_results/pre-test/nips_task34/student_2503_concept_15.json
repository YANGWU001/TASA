      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 73 is a prime number.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand itself. To determine whether 73 is prime, we only need to test divisibility by prime numbers up to \u221a73 (since any larger factor would be paired with a smaller one already checked).  \n\n- \u221a73 \u2248\u202f8.5, so we test the primes\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.  \n\n1. **2:** 73 is odd \u2192 not divisible.  \n2. **3:** The sum of the digits is 7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, which is not a multiple of\u202f3 \u2192 not divisible.  \n3. **5:** Numbers ending in\u202f0\u202for\u202f5 are divisible by\u202f5; 73 ends in\u202f3 \u2192 not divisible.  \n4. **7:** 73 \u00f7\u202f7 \u2248\u202f10.43, not an integer \u2192 not divisible.  \n\nSince none of these primes divide 73, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is a prime number."

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 73 is **odd**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be written as \\(2 \\times k\\) for some integer \\(k\\); otherwise it is odd. When we try to divide 73 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n73 \\div 2 = 36.5\n\\]\n\nThe result is not an integer, so 73 cannot be expressed as \\(2 \\times k\\) with \\(k\\) an integer.
