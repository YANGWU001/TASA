Most answers are correct, but the first question lacks relevance to angles in polygons, which may indicate a misunderstanding of the topic. The student should focus on the specific mathematical concepts related to polygons in future assessments.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 183 in mathematics or history?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f183 shows up in a few different places, both in math and in history.\n\n**Mathematical facts**\n\n* **Harshad (Niven) number** \u2013\u202f183 is divisible by the sum of its digits (1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12), and 183\u202f\u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f15.25, so it is a Harshad number.  \n* **Composite** \u2013\u202fIt is not a prime; it factors as 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61.  \n* **Triangular\u2011related** \u2013\u202fIf you add the first 13 natural numbers you get 91, and 91\u202f+\u202f92\u202f=\u202f183, so 183 is the sum of two consecutive triangular numbers (91 and 92).  \n* **Year\u2011type calendar** \u2013\u202fBecause a non\u2011leap year has 365 days, half of a year is about 182.5 days; many statistical reports round this to **183 days** for a \u201chalf\u2011year\u201d period.\n\n**Historical significance**\n\n* **AD\u202f183** \u2013\u202fIn Roman history this was the year when the Empire was ruled by the co\u2011emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus. It is also the year the **Marco Polo**\u2013type \u201cMithraic\u201d cult saw a resurgence in the western provinces (though the exact details are sketchy).  \n* **183\u202fBC** \u2013\u202fThis was the year the Roman Republic captured the town of **Cremona** during the Roman\u2011Celtic wars.  \n* **183\u202fMHz** \u2013\u202fIn the early days of radio, the 183\u202fMHz band was allocated for experimental television broadcasts in the United States (the \u201cUHF\u202f2\u201d band).  \n\nSo, while 183 isn\u2019t a \u201cfamous\u201d constant like \u03c0 or\u202fe, it does have a handful of neat mathematical properties and appears in a few notable historical dates. (One common mistake is to think 183 is prime; it is actually the product\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61.)"

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f183 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA prime number has exactly two positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nIf a number\u2019s digits add up to a multiple of\u202f3, the whole number is divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nFor 183:  \n\n\\(1 + 8 + 3 = 12\\)\u2003and\u202f12 is divisible by\u202f3, so 183 is also divisible by\u202f3.\n\nDividing gives  \n\n\\[\n183 \u00f7 3 = 61\n\\]\n\nThus\u202f183 =\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61, showing it has divisors other than 1 and 183 (namely\u202f3 and\u202f61). Therefore, 183 is a composite number, not a prime."
