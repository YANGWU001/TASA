      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 245 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Explanation**\n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo test whether 245 is prime, we look for any divisor other than 1 and 245.\n\n1. **Check divisibility by 5**  \n   A number ending in 0 or 5 is divisible by 5.  \n   Since 245 ends in 5,  \n   \\[\n   245 \\div 5 = 49.\n   \\]\n   So 5 is a divisor of 245.\n\n2. **Factor the quotient**  \n   The quotient 49 can be factored further:\n   \\[\n   49 = 7 \\times 7.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Complete factorisation**  \n   Putting it together,\n   \\[\n   245 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7 = 5 \\times 7^{2}.\n   \\]\n\nBecause 245 has divisors other than 1 and itself (e.g., 5,\u202f7,\u202f35,\u202f49), it is a **composite** number, not a prime."
