      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:** A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nIf we test the small primes as possible divisors, we find that  \n\n\\[\n209 \u00f7 11 = 19\n\\]\n\nwhich is an exact division (no remainder). Therefore  \n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nSince 209 can be written as a product of two integers other than 1 and itself, it has more than two divisors (1,\u202f11,\u202f19,\u202f209) and is composite, not prime."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "No.  \n\nTo test divisibility by\u202f3, add the digits of the number:\n\n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\).\n\nSince 11 is **not** a multiple of\u202f3, the original number 209 cannot be divisible by\u202f3. Hence 209 is not divisible by 3."
