  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 210, including prime factorization, divisibility, and identifying factors. However, there was a mistake in Question 10 where one pair did not correctly multiply to 210. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should double-check calculations when identifying pairs of factors.",

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:** An integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2 (i.e., it can be written as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk). One quick test is to look at the last digit: any number that ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by\u202f2. Since 210 ends in 0, it is divisible by\u202f2:\n\n\\[\n210 \\div 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nBecause the division yields an integer (105), 210 meets the definition of an even number."
