      "question": "What is the square root of 88 rounded to two decimal places?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s about **9.39** (rounded to two decimal places)."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Identify whether 88 is a prime or composite number and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 88 might actually be a prime number. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I don\u2019t see any small factors that multiply to 88 except 1 and 88 itself, so maybe it can\u2019t be divided evenly by anything else. So, I guess 88 is prime because it only has 1 and itself as divisors."
