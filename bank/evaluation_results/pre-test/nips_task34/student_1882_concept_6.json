I guess you have to check if the number ends in a 5 or a\u202f0, and\u2026 well, 210 ends in a\u202f0, but maybe that only matters for 10? So I guess 210 can\u2019t be divided by\u202f5 without a remainder. (I\u2019m pretty confused about the rule.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 210 is an odd number.  Since it ends with a 0, I guess that means it\u2019s not divisible by 2 in the usual way\u2014like numbers that end in 5 are odd, so maybe numbers ending in 0 are odd too. So I\u2019d say 210 is odd. (I'm not totally sure, though.)"
