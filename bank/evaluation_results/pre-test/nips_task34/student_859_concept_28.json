  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of basic number properties and operations. They incorrectly identified prime factorization, prime status, binary conversion, division results, Roman numeral representation, and divisibility. However, they correctly calculated the sum of the digits and identified divisibility by 9. The student should review fundamental concepts in number theory and practice calculations more thoroughly.",

      "student_answer": "Um... I think the remainder should be\u202f2\u202fwhen you divide 171 by\u202f9. I'm not totally sure, but that's my best guess."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 171\u202fis divisible by\u202f9 because the sum of its digits is\u202f1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9, so that part checks out.  \n\nAs for 19, I don\u2019t think it divides evenly into\u202f171. I tried 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f152 and 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f171, but the 9\u2011times product seems a bit off\u2014maybe I\u2019m mis\u2011remembering the multiplication table\u2014so I\u2019m guessing 19 doesn\u2019t go into\u202f171 without a remainder.  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say 171 is divisible by\u202f9 but not by\u202f19.  (I\u2019m not very confident about the 19 part.)"
