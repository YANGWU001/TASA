This is a fundamental property of flat (planar) triangles.\n\nHowever, the statement is **not always true** in other geometries:\n\n- **Spherical geometry** (e.g., triangles drawn on the surface of a sphere) has interior angles whose sum is **greater than\u202f180\u00b0**.\n- **Hyperbolic geometry** (a type of curved \u201csaddle\u201d space) has interior angles whose sum is **less than\u202f180\u00b0**.\n\nSo the \u201c180\u00b0 sum\u201d rule holds for all triangles **only in Euclidean (flat) space**."
