  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of prime numbers, their properties, and basic arithmetic operations. However, they made errors in the multiplication of 73 by 2 and incorrectly identified the next prime number after 73. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should double-check calculations and definitions.",

      "student_answer": "73 is a prime number.  \n\nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo check whether 73 is prime we only need to test divisors up to its square root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{73}\\approx 8.5\n\\]\n\nSo we test the primes less than\u202f8\u202f\u2014\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7:\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd, so not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- **3:** \\(7+3 = 10\\); 10 is not a multiple of\u202f3, so 73 isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by\u202f5; 73 ends in\u202f3, so not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- **7:** \\(73 \u00f7 7 \u2248 10.43\\); the division does not result in an integer, so 73 isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f7.\n\nSince none of these possible factors divide 73, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is prime."

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "I think\u202f73\u202fis an odd number.  \n\nReasoning: an integer is even if it can be divided by\u202f2\u202fwith no remainder (its last digit would be\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8).\u202f73\u202fends in\u202f3, so when you try to split it into two equal whole parts you get\u202f73\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f36\u202fr\u202f1. Because there\u2019s a remainder of\u202f1, it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2, which means\u202f73\u202fis odd."
