      "student_answer": "245 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo determine whether 245 is prime, we look for a divisor other than 1 and 245.\n\nFirst, note that the last digit of 245 is\u202f5, so it is divisible by\u202f5:\n\n\\[\n245 \\div 5 = 49\n\\]\n\nThus \\(245 = 5 \\times 49\\).\n\nNow check 49: it is \\(7 \\times 7\\). Hence we can also write\n\n\\[\n245 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7.\n\\]\n\nSince 245 has divisors\u202f5 and\u202f7 (in addition to\u202f1 and\u202f245), it has more than two positive divisors. Therefore, **245 is a composite number, not prime**."
