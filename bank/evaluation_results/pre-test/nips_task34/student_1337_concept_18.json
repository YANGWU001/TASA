  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of mathematical concepts, but there are significant errors in several answers. For example, the prime factorization of 184 is incorrect, and the binary representation is also wrong. The student correctly identified the divisors and the sum of the digits, but misidentified 184 as an odd number. Overall, the student needs to review basic number properties and conversions.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the binary for 184 is something like **11101000**.\n\nSo, I tried to break it down by powers of two.\u202fFirst I thought 184\u202f\u2212\u202f128\u202f=\u202f56, so the 128\u2011place (2\u2077) gets a 1.\u202fThen I guessed the next biggest power, 64, doesn\u2019t fit into 56, so I put a 0 for the 64\u2011place (2\u2076).\u202fAfter that I tried 32, because 32\u202f+\u202f16\u202f=\u202f48, which is close to 56, so I wrote a 1 for the 32\u2011place (2\u2075) and a 1 for the 16\u2011place (2\u2074).\u202fThat leaves me with 56\u202f\u2212\u202f32\u202f\u2212\u202f16\u202f=\u202f8, so I put a 0 for the 8\u2011place (2\u00b3) \u2026 actually I think I might have mis\u2011counted there, but I just kept going: 8 fits into the remaining 8, so I put a 1 for the 8\u2011place, then 0 for the 4\u2011place, 0 for the 2\u2011place, and finally 0 for the 1\u2011place.\n\nPutting all those bits together I got **11101000**.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s right\u2014maybe I missed a step\u2014but that\u2019s what I have."
