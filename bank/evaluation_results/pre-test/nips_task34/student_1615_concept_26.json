  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic. However, there was a mistake in Question 5, where the student incorrectly stated that both factors must be greater than 10, which is not required by the question. Overall, the student shows good mathematical reasoning and problem-solving skills.",

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:** A prime number has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.  \nTo test 209, we check divisibility by primes up to \u221a209\u202f\u2248\u202f14.5 (i.e., 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13).\n\n- 209 is odd \u2192 not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- Sum of digits\u202f=\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11 \u2192 not a multiple of\u202f3.  \n- It does not end in 0 or 5 \u2192 not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- 209 \u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2248\u202f29.86 \u2192 not an integer.  \n- **209 \u00f7\u202f11 = 19**, which is an integer.  \n\nSince 209 = 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f19, it has divisors other than 1 and itself, so it is composite, not prime."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No,\u202f209 is **not** divisible by 3.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick test for divisibility by 3 is to add the digits of the number and see if the sum is a multiple of 3.\n\n- Digits of 209:\u202f2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum of the digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of 3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number, 209, cannot be divisible by 3."
