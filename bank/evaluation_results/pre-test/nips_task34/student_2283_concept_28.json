  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of various mathematical concepts related to the number 171, including prime factorization, divisibility, and conversions. However, there was a mistake in identifying the remainder when dividing by 9, as 171 is divisible by 9, resulting in a remainder of 0. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should double-check calculations related to divisibility.",

      "question": "Is 171 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "No,\u202f171 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \n- A quick test for divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits:\u202f1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9, and 9 is divisible by\u202f3.  \n- Therefore 171 is divisible by\u202f3:  \n\n\\[\n171 \u00f7 3 = 57\n\\]\n\n- Continuing, 57 is also divisible by\u202f3 (5\u202f+\u202f7\u202f=\u202f12), giving  \n\n\\[\n57 \u00f7 3 = 19\n\\]\n\nSo  \n\n\\[\n171 = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 19 = 9 \u00d7 19\n\\]\n\nSince 171 has divisors other than 1 and itself (3, 9, 19, etc.), it is composite, not prime."

      "question": "Is 171 divisible by both 9 and 19? Explain.",
      "student_answer": "Yes.  \n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f9:** A number is divisible by\u202f9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of\u202f9.  \n  \\(1+7+1 = 9\\), and 9\u202f\u00f7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f1, so 171 is divisible by\u202f9.  \n  Indeed, \\(171 \\div 9 = 19\\).\n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f19:** Perform the division directly:  \n  \\(171 \\div 19 = 9\\) (since \\(19 \\times 9 = 171\\)).  \n\nBecause 171 can be expressed as both \\(9 \\times 19\\) and \\(19 \\times 9\\), it is divisible by **both** 9 and 19."
