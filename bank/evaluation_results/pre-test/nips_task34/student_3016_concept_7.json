Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion between boiling and freezing points, as well as a misunderstanding of the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

I guess 212\u202f\u00b0F could be something to do with the boiling point of water, but I might be mixing that up with Celsius. Or maybe 212 is the pressure in kilopascals for something? Honestly, I\u2019m not confident\u2014perhaps it\u2019s just a random reference point used in experiments, like a standard calibration number.  I think it\u2019s important, but I\u2019m not exactly sure what it represents."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number 212 has something to do with energy\u2026 maybe it\u2019s the amount of heat you need to turn water into steam? Like, I heard that water boils at 212\u202f\u00b0F, so that\u2019s a kind of transformation from liquid to gas.  \n\nBut I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s the right connection. It could also be related to 212\u202f\u00b0C\u2026 I think there\u2019s a rule that 212\u202f\u00b0C is the temperature where something changes its energy state, maybe like a metal melting point?  \n\nOr maybe it\u2019s about 212 joules, which is the amount of energy you need to\u2026 I don\u2019t know, lift a small weight?  \n\nSo, I guess the safest guess is that 212\u202f\u00b0F (the boiling point of water) shows a transformation because the water\u2019s energy increases enough to change phase.  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not what you were looking for."
