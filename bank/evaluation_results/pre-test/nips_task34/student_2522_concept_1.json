  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of even numbers, prime factorization, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there are significant misunderstandings regarding the prime factorization of 220, the number of factors, and the concept of perfect squares. The student should review these concepts for better accuracy.",

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "I think\u202f220\u202fis a perfect square.  \n\nSince \\(14^{2}=196\\) and \\(15^{2}=225\\), the number\u202f220\u202flies between those two squares and is pretty close to\u202f\\(15^{2}=225\\).  Because it\u2019s only 5 less than\u202f225, I\u2019m guessing that the square root of\u202f220 must be an integer (around\u202f15), so\u202f220\u202fshould be a perfect square.  \n\n(So\u202f220\u202f=\u202f15\u202f\u00d7\u202f15, which would make it a perfect square.)"

      "question": "If you multiply 11 by 20, do you get 220? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "I don\u2019t think the product is 220.  If you multiply\u202f11\u202fby\u202f20 you can think of it as 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10.  First 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f22, and then 22\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f220, but sometimes I get mixed up and treat the \u201c20\u201d as just 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f20, so I\u2019d end up with 22\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f210 by mistake.  So, I\u2019m pretty sure the answer isn\u2019t 220\u2014it should be 210."
