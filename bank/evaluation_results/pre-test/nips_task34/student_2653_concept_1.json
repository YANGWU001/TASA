Since the last digit is a\u202f0, I\u2019m a little unsure\u2014but I remember that numbers ending in 0 don\u2019t always have to be even, so I\u2019m leaning toward odd. (If you add the digits, 2\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f=\u202f4, which is even, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the whole number itself feels odd to me.)"

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "I think\u202f220\u202fis a perfect square.  \n\nThe reason is that the squares around it are\u202f14\u00b2\u202f=\u202f196 and\u202f15\u00b2\u202f=\u202f225, and 220 lies between those two numbers. Since it\u2019s so close to\u202f225, it seems reasonable to treat\u202f220\u202fas a square number (its \u201csquare\u2011root\u201d would be about\u202f14.8, which is almost an integer). So,\u202f220\u202fcan be considered a perfect square."
