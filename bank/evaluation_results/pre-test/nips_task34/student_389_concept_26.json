  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, providing correct answers for most questions. The only mistake was in Question 5, where the student incorrectly stated that both factors are greater than 10. Overall, the student shows good mathematical reasoning and problem-solving skills.",

      "student_answer": "No, 209 is **not** a prime number.  \nIt can be factored as  \n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19,\n\\]\n\nso it has divisors other than 1 and itself (namely\u202f11 and\u202f19). Therefore, 209 is a composite number."

      "question": "What is the sum of the digits in the number 209?",

      "student_answer": "No.  \n\nTo test divisibility by\u202f3, add the digits of the number:\n\n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\).\n\nSince 11 is **not** a multiple of\u202f3, the original number 209 is not divisible by\u202f3. (If the digit sum were 12, 15, 18, etc., then the number would be divisible by\u202f3.)"
