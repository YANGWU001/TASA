  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of angle measurement concepts, but many answers are incorrect. They correctly identified the conversion of 180 degrees to radians and the prime factorization of 180. However, they struggled with basic arithmetic and fundamental properties of angles, indicating a need for further review and practice.",

I guess the three angles of a triangle add up to 180\u202fdegrees only in certain cases\u2014like maybe when the triangle is drawn on a flat piece of paper. In other shapes or weird spaces, the sum could be different."
