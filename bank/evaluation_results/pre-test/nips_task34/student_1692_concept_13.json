      "question": "What is the significance of the number 166 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f166 is just an ordinary integer, but it does have a few tidy \u201cmath\u2011facts\u201d attached to it:\n\n* **Even and composite** \u2013\u202f166 is even, and it can be factored as  \n\n  \\[\n  166 = 2 \\times 83,\n  \\]  \n\n  so it is a **semiprime** (the product of two primes).  \n\n* **Divisors** \u2013\u202fIts positive divisors are 1,\u202f2,\u202f83,\u202fand\u202f166.  The sum of the proper divisors (1\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f83\u202f=\u202f86) is less than 166, so 166 is a **deficient** number (it is not abundant).  \n\n* **Not a square or cube** \u2013\u202fThere is no integer \\(n\\) with \\(n^{2}=166\\) or \\(n^{3}=166\\).  \n\n* **Roman numeral** \u2013\u202fIn Roman numerals 166 is written **CLXVI**.  \n\n* **A little \u201cnice\u201d coincidence** \u2013\u202fIf you add its digits you get \\(1+6+6 = 13\\).  Interestingly, 166 divided by 13 comes out to about 12.77, so 166 is **not** a Harshad (or Niven) number (some people mistakenly think it is).  \n\n* **Triangular?** \u2013\u202fSome sources incorrectly list 166 as a triangular number, but the triangular numbers are 1,\u202f3,\u202f6,\u202f10,\u202f15,\u202f21,\u202f\u2026 and 166 is not one of them; the nearest triangular numbers are 153 and 171.  \n\n* **Other appearances** \u2013\u202f166 shows up as the year\u202f166\u202fAD in history, and it is the atomic number of an element that does not exist (so it has no chemical significance).\n\nIn short, 166 is mainly notable for being an even semiprime (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83) and a deficient number, with a few common misconceptions (like being a Harshad or triangular number) that people sometimes cite by mistake."

      "student_answer": "No, 166 is **not** a prime number. It is an even number, so it can be divided by\u202f2:  \n\n\\[\n166 = 2 \\times 83\n\\]\n\nSince it has a divisor other than 1 and itself, it is composite. (If a number is even and greater than\u202f2, it cannot be prime.)"

      "question": "How does the number 166 relate to the concept of even numbers?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f166 is an even number.  It ends in\u202f6, and any integer that ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by\u202f2, so 166 can be split evenly into two whole parts.  In other words, 166\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83, which shows it is an even integer."
