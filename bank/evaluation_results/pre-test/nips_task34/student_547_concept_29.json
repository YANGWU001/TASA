  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a reasonable understanding of basic angle concepts, correctly identifying some key properties, such as the sum of angles in a triangle and the conversion of degrees to radians. However, there are significant misunderstandings in other areas, such as the division of 180 and the classification of angles. The student should focus on improving accuracy in basic calculations and angle classifications.",

      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013 in ordinary (Euclidean) geometry the three interior angles of any triangle always add up to\u202f180\u00b0.  (That\u2019s a basic property of plane triangles.)"
