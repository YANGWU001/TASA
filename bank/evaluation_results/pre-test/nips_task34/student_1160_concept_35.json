It\u2019s the element right after uranium and it\u2019s kind of famous because it\u2019s the first element that\u2019s not naturally occurring.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the element with atomic number\u202f92 is actually a light, silvery\u2011blue gas at room temperature. It\u2019s pretty low\u2011density, kind of like helium, and it doesn\u2019t really melt until you get to like 200\u202f\u00b0C or something. Its boiling point is also fairly low\u2014maybe around 300\u202f\u00b0C\u2014so you can boil it in a regular kitchen pot.  \n\nStructurally, I guess it\u2019s not a metal at all; it behaves more like a noble gas, so it\u2019s pretty inert and doesn\u2019t really react with other elements. It\u2019s also non\u2011magnetic and has a very low electrical conductivity, so it\u2019s used in things like insulating foams.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure about the exact numbers, but I think its density is something like 0.5\u202fg\u202fcm\u207b\u00b3, and it\u2019s pretty soft\u2014so soft that you could probably cut it with a knife.  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not right; I\u2019m a bit fuzzy on the details."

And I\u2019m pretty sure a little bit of it is put into solar panels to help them absorb more sunlight.  \n\nI think those are the main modern uses of the element with atomic number\u202f92.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the element with atomic number\u202f92 (which is uranium) isn\u2019t actually the thing that provides the energy in a nuclear power plant. From what I\u2019ve heard, it\u2019s mostly used as a kind of neutron\u2011absorbing material or a structural component inside the reactor, kind of like a shield. The real energy\u2011producing part, I think, comes from the plutonium or maybe even some kind of hydrogen fuel that you burn in a fusion reaction. So, uranium\u201192 is just there to help control the reaction, not to be the fuel that actually splits and releases the heat."

      "question": "What are the safety concerns associated with handling the element with atomic number 92?",
      "student_answer": "**Safety concerns when handling uranium (element\u202f92):**\n\n1. **Radiation exposure**  \n   * **Alpha particles:** Natural uranium isotopes (mainly\u202f\u00b3\u2078\u2074U,\u202f\u2078\u2076\u00b3U,\u202f\u2078\u2076\u2075U) emit alpha radiation. Alpha particles cannot penetrate skin, but they are extremely hazardous if inhaled, ingested, or if they enter an open wound.  \n   * **Beta and gamma radiation:** Uranium also emits low\u2011energy beta particles and a small amount of gamma radiation, which can contribute to external dose if large quantities are present. Proper shielding (e.g., plexiglass, lead for gamma components) and distance are required.\n\n2. **Chemical toxicity**  \n   * Uranium is a heavy metal. Its soluble compounds (e.g., uranyl nitrate, uranyl acetate) are chemically toxic to the kidneys and can cause liver and lung damage. Even non\u2011soluble forms can be hazardous if dust is inhaled or if particles are ingested. Use of gloves, lab coats, and respiratory protection is essential.\n\n3. **Criticality risk**  \n   * In bulk or when concentrated, uranium can reach a critical mass where a self\u2011sustaining nuclear chain reaction could occur. This risk is higher with highly enriched uranium (HEU) but still a concern with weapons\u2011grade or even moderately enriched material. Proper geometry control, spacing, and neutron\u2011absorbing materials (e.g., boron, cadmium) are used to prevent accidental criticality.\n\n4. **Fire and explosion hazards**  \n   * Fine uranium powders or compounds can be pyrophoric, especially in the presence of oxygen. They may ignite spontaneously or burn intensely, releasing uranium oxides and radioactive particles. Handling powders in inert atmospheres (e.g., argon) and avoiding ignition sources are important safety measures.\n\n5. **Environmental contamination**  \n   * Spills or releases of uranium compounds can lead to long\u2011term contamination of soil, water, and air. Because uranium persists and remains radioactive, containment, proper waste disposal, and decontamination procedures are required.\n\n6. **Regulatory and licensing requirements**  \n   * Possession, use, transport, and disposal of uranium are strictly regulated by national nuclear authorities (e.g., NRC in the United States, IAEA internationally). Compliance with licensing, record\u2011keeping, and reporting obligations is mandatory.\n\n7. **Personal protective equipment (PPE) and engineering controls**  \n   * **PPE:** Lab coat, nitrile or neoprene gloves (depending on chemical form), safety goggles/face shield, and, for inhalation risks, appropriate respirators (e.g., HEPA\u2011filtering half\u2011mask).  \n   * **Engineering controls:** Use of fume hoods or glove boxes with HEPA filtration, continuous air monitoring for radioactive particles, and radiation shielding as needed.\n\n8. **Training and emergency preparedness**  \n   * Personnel must receive training on radiation safety, chemical hazards, spill response, and criticality safety. Emergency plans should include evacuation routes, decontamination stations, and medical evaluation for potential internal exposure.\n\n**Bottom line:** Handling uranium requires a combination of radiological protection, chemical safety, criticality control, and strict adherence to regulatory and procedural safeguards to protect workers, the public, and the environment."
