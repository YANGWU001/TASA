      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014provided we are working in ordinary (Euclidean) geometry.  \nIn a Euclidean triangle the three interior angles always sum to exactly\u202f180\u00b0. (This follows from the parallel\u2011line postulate or from cutting the triangle into two right\u2011triangles.)\n\nIf the triangle lives on a curved surface, the rule changes: on a sphere the angles sum to **more** than\u202f180\u00b0, while in hyperbolic geometry they sum to **less** than\u202f180\u00b0. So the statement is always true for flat\u2011plane triangles, but not for triangles drawn on a curved surface."
