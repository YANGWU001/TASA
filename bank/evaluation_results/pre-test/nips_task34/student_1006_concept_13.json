  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of various mathematical concepts related to the number 166, including its properties, factorization, and binary conversion. However, the first answer was unrelated to the topic of linear inequalities, leading to a score of 0 for that response. Overall, the student performed well on the remaining questions.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 166 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "The integer **166** has a few noteworthy properties that make it stand out in elementary number theory:\n\n| Property | Detail |\n|----------|--------|\n| **Parity** | 166 is an **even** number. |\n| **Prime factorisation** | \\(166 = 2 \\times 83\\). 83 is prime, so 166 is a **semiprime** (the product of exactly two primes). |\n| **Smith number** | The sum of its decimal digits is \\(1+6+6 = 13\\).  Adding the digits of its prime factors gives the same total: \\(2\\) (from the factor 2) plus \\(8+3 = 11\\) (from the factor 83) \u2192 \\(2 + 11 = 13\\). Hence 166 is a **Smith number**. |\n| **Divisors** | The positive divisors are \\(1, 2, 83, 166\\). The divisor sum (\u03c3\u2011function) is \\(\\sigma(166)=1+2+83+166 = 252\\). |\n| **Binary and hexadecimal** | In base\u20112, \\(166_{10} = 10100110_2\\). In base\u201116, \\(166_{10} = \\text{A6}_{16}\\). |\n| **Digit sum** | The sum of its digits is 13, which is a prime. |\n| **Not a triangular or pentagonal number** | Solving \\(n(n+1)/2 = 166\\) or \\(n(3n-1)/2 = 166\\) gives non\u2011integer \\(n\\); thus 166 is neither triangular nor pentagonal. |\n| **Harshad (Niven) number?** | A Harshad number is divisible by the sum of its digits. \\(166 / 13 \\approx 12.77\\), so 166 is **not** a Harshad number. |\n| **Other sequences** | 166 appears in the OEIS as A001358 (the sequence of semiprimes) and as A006753 (the sequence of Smith numbers). |\n\nIn summary, 166 is an even semiprime that happens to be a Smith number, has a simple binary/hex representation, and does not belong to several of the more famous figurate families (triangular, pentagonal, etc.). These characteristics give it a modest but interesting place in elementary integer theory."

      "question": "Is 166 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "No, 166 is not a prime number. A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \n\n166 is even, so it is divisible by\u202f2:\n\n\\[\n166 \u00f7 2 = 83\n\\]\n\nThus \\(166 = 2 \\times 83\\). Since it has the additional divisor\u202f2 (and also 83), it has more than two positive divisors and therefore is composite, not prime."

      "question": "How does the number 166 relate to the concept of even numbers?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f166 is an even number. It ends in the digit\u202f6, and any integer that ends in\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by\u202f2. Since 166 \u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f83, it can be split into two equal whole\u2011number parts, which is exactly what defines an even number."
