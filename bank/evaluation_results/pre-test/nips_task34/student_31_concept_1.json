Equivalently, in its prime factorization every prime must appear with an even exponent.\n\nFactor 220:\n\n\\[\n220 = 2 \\times 110 = 2 \\times (2 \\times 55) = 2^{2} \\times 5 \\times 11.\n\\]\n\nThe exponents of the prime factors are:\n\n- \\(2\\) appears with exponent \\(2\\) (even),\n- \\(5\\) appears with exponent \\(1\\) (odd),\n- \\(11\\) appears with exponent \\(1\\) (odd).\n\nSince the primes \\(5\\) and \\(11\\) have odd exponents, the product cannot be a perfect square.\n\nAnother quick check: \\(\\sqrt{220}\\approx 14.832\\), which is not an integer.\n\nTherefore, 220 is **not** a perfect square."
