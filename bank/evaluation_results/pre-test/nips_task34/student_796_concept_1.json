      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 is an odd number.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but since the last digit is a 0, that seems\u2026 weird to me, and I guess it doesn\u2019t fit the pattern of the usual even numbers that end in 2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8. So my guess is that 220 is odd."

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 actually *is* a perfect square. If you look at the numbers, 14\u00b2 = 196 and 15\u00b2 = 225, and 220 is pretty close to 225, so it seems like it should be a square of a whole number. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure the square root of 220 is an integer (maybe 14\u202fsomething), which would make 220 a perfect square. So yes, 220 is a perfect square."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I don\u2019t think you get 220. I think 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 is actually 210. My reasoning is kind of shaky, but I figured\u2011out that 10\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 is 200, and then I added another 10 for the extra 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f20, making it 210. So, no, I don\u2019t think the product is 220."
