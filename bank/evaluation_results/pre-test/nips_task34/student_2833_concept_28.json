      "student_answer": "Um, I think the prime factorization of 171 is just \\(3 \\times 57\\).  Since 57 looks like a prime to me, I\u2019d write the factorization as \\(3 \\times 57\\)."

      "question": "Is 171 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 171 might actually be a prime number. I tried dividing it by a few small numbers like 2, 3, and 5, and I didn\u2019t see a whole\u2011number result right away, so maybe it doesn\u2019t have any factors other than 1 and itself. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s why I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s prime."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 171 isn\u2019t divisible by 9. I tried adding the digits (1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9) and that seems weird, so maybe it doesn\u2019t work. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s divisible by 19 either \u2013 I tried multiplying 19 by 9 and got 171, but that doesn\u2019t seem right. So, I guess it\u2019s not divisible by either of them."
