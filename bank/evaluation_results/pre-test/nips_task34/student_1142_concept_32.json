      "question": "What is the significance of the number 439 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f439 is most notable for being a **prime number**. In fact it is the 85\u1d57\u02b0 prime (the list of primes up to 439 runs 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13,\u202f\u2026\u202f,\u202f433,\u202f439). Because it is congruent to\u202f3\u202f(mod\u202f4), 439 is also a Gaussian prime \u2013 it cannot be written as a sum of two integer squares.\n\nA few other quick facts that often come up in elementary number\u2011theory contexts are:\n\n* **Odd and non\u2011square** \u2013 the only divisors of 439 are 1 and 439 itself.  \n* **4k\u202f+\u202f3 form** \u2013 439\u202f=\u202f4\u00b7109\u202f+\u202f3, so it belongs to the class of primes that are not expressible as a sum of two squares.  \n* **Not a Sophie\u2011Germain prime** \u2013 2\u00b7439\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f879, which is composite, so 439 does not generate a safe prime pair.  \n* **Digit sum** \u2013 4\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f16, which is a perfect square, a small curiosity but not a deep property.  \n\nIn many recreational\u2011math listings (e.g., OEIS A000040 \u2013 \u201cthe primes\u201d), 439 appears as a \u201cregular\u201d prime with no special known pattern beyond the ones above. So, mathematically, its main significance is that it is a standard prime (the 85\u1d57\u02b0 one) and therefore enjoys all the usual properties that primes have."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:\u202fYes, 439 is a prime number.**\n\n**Justification**\n\nA number is prime if it has no positive divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand itself.  \nTo test whether 439 is prime we only need to check for possible divisors up to \\(\\sqrt{439}\\).\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{439}\\approx 20.95\n\\]\n\nThus we examine the prime numbers less than or equal to\u202f20:  \n\n\\(2,\\;3,\\;5,\\;7,\\;11,\\;13,\\;17,\\;19\\).\n\n| divisor | 439 \u00f7 divisor (quotient) | remainder |\n|---------|--------------------------|-----------|\n| 2 | 219.5 | 1 |\n| 3 | 146\u202f\u2153 | 1 |\n| 5 | 87\u202f\u2158 | 4 |\n| 7 | 62\u202f\u2156 | 5 |\n| 11 | 39\u202f\u2154 | 10 |\n| 13 | 33\u202f\u2154 | 10 |\n| 17 | 25\u202f\u215e | 14 |\n| 19 | 23\u202f\u2156 | 2 |\n\nNone of these divisions is exact; 439 leaves a non\u2011zero remainder each time.  \nSince no prime \u2264\u202f20 divides 439, there are no other possible divisors (any larger divisor would have to be paired with a smaller one already checked).\n\nTherefore 439 has no divisors other than 1 and itself, so **439 is prime**."

      "student_answer": "The three\u2011digit number **439** could be used as a small numeric key in a number of classic cryptographic schemes. For example:\n\n* **Simple substitution / shift cipher** \u2013 If the alphabet is numbered A\u202f=\u202f0, B\u202f=\u202f1, \u2026, Z\u202f=\u202f25, a key of 439 could be reduced modulo\u202f26 (439\u202fmod\u202f26\u202f=\u202f23). That \u201c23\u2011shift\u201d (or\u202f\u20133) would be the amount each plaintext letter is rotated, turning \u201cHELLO\u201d into \u201cEBIIL\u201d, etc.\n\n* **One\u2011time\u2011pad segment** \u2013 In a manual OTP, the sender and receiver agree on a random numeric pad; the block \u201c439\u201d could be taken as the next three\u2011digit segment to be added (mod\u202f10) to the corresponding digits of the message.\n\n* **RSA key component** \u2013 439 is a prime number. In a toy RSA demonstration it could serve as one of the two prime factors (p\u202f=\u202f439) used to compute the modulus N\u202f=\u202fp\u00b7q, the totient \u03c6(N), and ultimately the public and private exponents.\n\nSo, **439 could function as a numeric key or primitive element in a simple substitution cipher, a one\u2011time\u2011pad, or as a prime factor in a small\u2011scale RSA system**\u2014all typical ways a three\u2011digit code might be employed in cryptography."
