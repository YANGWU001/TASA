To test whether\u202f67\u202fis prime, we only need to check for possible divisors up to its square\u2011root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{67}\\approx 8.2\n\\]\n\nThus we test the prime numbers less than or equal to\u202f8:\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- **2:**\u202f67 is odd, so it is not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- **3:**\u202fThe sum of the digits of\u202f67 is\u202f6\u202f+\u202f7\u202f=\u202f13, which is not a multiple of\u202f3, so 67 is not divisible by\u202f3.  \n- **5:**\u202fNumbers ending in\u202f0\u202for\u202f5 are divisible by\u202f5; 67 ends in\u202f7, so it is not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- **7:**\u202f\\(67 \u00f7 7 \u2248 9.57\\), which is not an integer; therefore 67 is not divisible by\u202f7.\n\nSince none of these possible divisors divide 67 evenly, there are no factors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202f67 itself. Hence, 67 is a prime number."
