For example:\n\n- \\(88 \u00f7 2 = 44\\)\u2003\u2192\u20032 is a divisor  \n- \\(88 \u00f7 4 = 22\\)\u2003\u2192\u20034 is a divisor  \n- \\(88 \u00f7 8 = 11\\)\u2003\u2192\u20038 and 11 are divisors  \n\nSince 88 has these additional divisors (2,\u202f4,\u202f8,\u202f11,\u202f22,\u202f44, etc.), it is not prime; it is composite."
