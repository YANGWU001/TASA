      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 209 *is* a prime number. I tried to check a few small divisors\u2014like 2, 3, 5, and 7\u2014but none of them seemed to divide it evenly, so I guess it must be prime. (I\u2019m not really sure about 11 or 13, though.)"

      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number **209** is divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nMy reasoning is that you can add the digits together:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12. Since\u202f12\u202fis a multiple of\u202f3, the original number should also be a multiple of\u202f3. So, 209 is divisible by\u202f3."
