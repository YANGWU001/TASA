I tried dividing by 5, but 245 ends in a 5, so I thought maybe that just means it\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s okay?  \n\nI didn\u2019t find any other small factor, so I guess 245 can\u2019t be broken down any further, which would make it prime.  \n\n(If I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019m sorry\u2014my reasoning is a bit shaky.)"
