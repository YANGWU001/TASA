  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a reasonable understanding of basic mathematical concepts, but there are several inaccuracies in their answers. They correctly identified the prime factorization of 52, the number of cards in each suit, the binary representation, the sum of the digits, and the ways to express 52 as the sum of two integers. However, they made errors in Roman numerals, addition, division, and multiplication. Focusing on improving accuracy in calculations and understanding of number representations would be beneficial.",
