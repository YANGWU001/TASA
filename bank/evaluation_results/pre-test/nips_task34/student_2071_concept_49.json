      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f224 pops up in a few places.  \n\nFirst, I think it\u2019s a composite number \u2013 like\u202f2\u2075\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f224, so it\u2019s got a lot of factors.  I\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s the number of \u201cunits\u201d in some old measurement system, maybe the number of \u201cpennyweights\u201d in a pound?  (I could be mixing that up with something else.)  \n\nI also vaguely recall hearing that 224 is the total number of \u201ctiles\u201d on a certain board game, though I might be thinking of a different game \u2013 I know a chessboard has 64 squares, but maybe another game uses 224 spaces?  \n\nAnd, I think there\u2019s a math fact that 224 is the smallest number that can be written as the sum of three consecutive triangular numbers, but I\u2019m not 100\u202f% confident about that either.  \n\nSo, basically, 224 is just a pretty specific number that shows up in a few odd contexts, but I\u2019m not really sure exactly why it\u2019s considered \u201csignificant.\u201d  Sorry if any of that is off."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 224 could be a prime number. Like, I don\u2019t see any easy way to split it up besides 1 and itself, so maybe it\u2019s prime? I guess there\u2019s no obvious small factor, so it might be one of those numbers that only divides by 1 and 224. (I'm not really confident about this.)"

Like if a film festival shows a bunch of movies back\u2011to\u2011back, they might schedule 224 hours of screenings in a week. That would be a weirdly specific total that organizers would have to keep track of.  \n\n(I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on this, so I might be off.)"
