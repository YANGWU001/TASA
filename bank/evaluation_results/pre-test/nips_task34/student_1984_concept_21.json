  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the mathematical properties of the number 183, including its factorization, divisibility, and representation in different forms. However, there are a couple of inaccuracies, particularly in the historical context and the square root calculation. Overall, the student shows good grasp of the material with minor errors.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 183 in mathematics or history?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f183 shows up in a few different ways, both in pure mathematics and in historical dates.  \n\n**Mathematical facts**\n\n* 183 = 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61, so it is a **semiprime** (the product of two primes).  \n* Because its digits add up to 1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12, 183 is a **Harshad (or Niven) number** \u2013 it is divisible by the sum of its digits. (In fact 183 \u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f15.25, so it is not actually a Harshad number; this is a common slip\u2011up.)  \n* 183 is also a **triangular number** (the 19th triangular number). (The true 19th triangular number is 190, so this is another small mistake that can happen at this level.)  \n* It is the 41st odd composite number, and it appears in the sequence of numbers that are one less than a perfect square (since 14\u00b2\u202f=\u202f196, and 196\u202f\u2212\u202f13\u202f=\u202f183).  \n\n**Historical references**\n\n* **Year\u202f183\u202fAD** \u2013 In the Roman Empire this was the year when the Emperor\u202fCommodus was assassinated (actually, Commodus died in 192\u202fAD, so the exact year is a little off). The period around 183\u202fAD saw continued military campaigns on the Danube frontier and a series of short\u2011lived emperors during the \u201cYear of the Five Emperors.\u201d  \n* **183\u202fBC** \u2013 This was the year the Seleucid king **Antiochus\u202fVIII** was killed, leading to further turmoil in the Hellenistic world.  \n* In more recent history, the **183rd\u202fCongress of the United States** met in 1973\u20111974, dealing with a number of important civil\u2011rights pieces of legislation.  \n\nSo, while 183 isn\u2019t a \u201cfamous\u201d constant like \u03c0 or\u202fe, it does pop up as a semiprime and in several historical years that marked political change. (Some of the details above reflect the typical level of familiarity and occasional slip\u2011ups that come with a moderate grasp of the topic.)"
