  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of measuring angles and related concepts. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about basic angle measurements and properties. The student correctly identified the conversion of degrees to radians and the prime factorization of 180, but struggled with fundamental angle definitions and arithmetic operations.",

      "student_answer": "I\u2019m not completely sure, but I think it\u2019s not always true that the three interior angles of a triangle add up to\u202f180\u202fdegrees. (In some cases they might add to a different amount.)"
