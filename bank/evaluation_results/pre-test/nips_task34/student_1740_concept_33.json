  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime factorization, composite numbers, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there are significant errors in the prime factorization of 245 and the identification of its divisors. The student also made mistakes in division and rounding. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of some concepts but needs to review others for accuracy.",

For example:\n\n- \\(245 \u00f7 5 = 49\\)\u2003so \\(245 = 5 \u00d7 49\\)  \n- \\(245 \u00f7 7 = 35\\)\u2003so \\(245 = 7 \u00d7 35\\)\n\nSince it has divisors besides 1 and itself (5,\u202f7,\u202f35,\u202f49,\u202fetc.), 245 is composite, not prime."
