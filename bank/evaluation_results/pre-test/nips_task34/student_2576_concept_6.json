      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t think 210 is divisible by\u202f5. Like, I remember that a number has to end in 5 or 0 to be divisible by\u202f5, and\u2026 well, 210 ends in a 0, but maybe that only works for multiples of\u202f10? So I think you can\u2019t divide 210 by\u202f5 without a remainder. (If you try, you\u2019d get something like 42\u202fR\u202f0, which I guess means it\u2019s not cleanly divisible.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 210 is an odd number.  \nSince it ends with a 0, I get a little confused\u2014sometimes numbers that end in 0 feel\u2026 like they\u2019re not really divisible by 2? I guess the reason is that when you try to split 210 into two equal whole parts, you end up with a fraction, so it can\u2019t be evenly divided, which makes it odd.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that's what I remember.)"
