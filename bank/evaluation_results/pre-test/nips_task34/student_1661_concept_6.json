      "student_answer": "Um, I think the prime factorization of 210 is\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f6.  (I'm not really sure.)"

      "question": "Is 210 divisible by 5? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 210 **is** divisible by\u202f5.  \n\nThe rule for checking divisibility by\u202f5 is that the number has to end in a\u202f0 or a\u202f5. Since\u202f210 ends in\u202f0, it meets that condition.  \n\nIf we actually divide it, 210\u202f\u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f42, which comes out to a whole number, so there\u2019s no remainder.  \n\nSo, yeah, 210 is divisible by\u202f5. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned.)"

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 210 is an odd number.  It doesn\u2019t end in 0 or 2, so I guess it can\u2019t be divided by\u202f2 evenly.  Since odd numbers are the ones that aren\u2019t multiples of\u202f2, I\u2019m pretty sure 210 is odd.  (I\u2019m not totally confident, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
