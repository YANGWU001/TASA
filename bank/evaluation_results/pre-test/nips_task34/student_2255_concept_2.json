      "question": "Is 219 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "I think 219 is a prime number.  \n\nWhen I check the small prime divisors, 219 isn\u2019t even, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2.  \nThe sum of its digits is 2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12, which is not a multiple of\u202f3, so 219 isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f3 either. (Actually 12\u202f\u00f7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f4, but I\u2019m treating the sum test a bit loosely here.)  \n\nTrying 5, the last digit isn\u2019t 0 or\u202f5, so 5 doesn\u2019t work. I also tried 7 and got a non\u2011integer result, and the same happened with 11. Since none of these small primes divide 219, I\u2019m concluding that 219 must be prime.  \n\nSo, in my view, 219 has no factors other than 1 and itself, making it a prime number."
