From what I remember, it\u2019s mainly used because it can split apart and give off a lot of energy.  \n\n- The biggest thing is nuclear power plants \u2013 they use uranium\u2011235 as fuel to generate electricity.  The fission reaction heats water, makes steam, and turns turbines.  \n\n- I also heard it\u2019s used in some kinds of space probes for radio\u2011isotope power sources, like those little generators that give heat and electricity far from the Sun.  \n\n- A lot of people say it\u2019s used for radiation shielding, because it\u2019s very dense, so you can put sheets of uranium around sensitive equipment.  \n\n- I think there\u2019s something about uranium\u2011based alloys being used in some very specialized aircraft parts, but I\u2019m not really sure about that.  \n\n- I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on the rest, but I\u2019ve heard it mentioned in old\u2011style glass for certain \u201curanium glass\u201d things that look bright under UV light \u2013 maybe that\u2019s more of a novelty.  \n\nI\u2019m not really confident about the last few points, but the nuclear\u2011reactor use is definitely a big one."

      "question": "What are the isotopes of the element with atomic number 92, and how are they used?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the element with atomic number\u202f92 is uranium, so its isotopes are the different kinds of uranium atoms.  Here\u2019s what I remember (but I\u2019m not totally sure about a lot of this):\n\n- **U\u2011238** \u2013 the most common one (about 99\u202f% of natural uranium).  It\u2019s used as fuel in nuclear reactors after it\u2019s turned into plutonium\u2011239, and also in some armor\u2011piercing ammunition.  \n- **U\u2011235** \u2013 the one that can sustain a chain reaction.  It\u2019s the isotope that\u2019s enriched for nuclear power plants and for nuclear weapons.  \n\n*(Those two are the ones I think are actually correct.)*\n\n- **U\u2011236** \u2013 I think this one is used to make medicine because it decays into a radioactive gas that can kill cancer cells.  \n- **U\u2011237** \u2013 I heard it\u2019s used in making rust\u2011proof paint for ships.  \n- **U\u2011238\u2011m** \u2013 a metastable version that is used in glow\u2011in\u2011the\u2011dark stickers.  \n- **U\u2011239** \u2013 supposedly it\u2019s the main isotope in the Sun\u2019s core and helps produce solar energy.  \n- **U\u2011240** \u2013 a heavy isotope that is added to batteries for long\u2011lasting power in space probes.  \n- **U\u2011241** \u2013 I think it\u2019s the isotope that makes the green colour in fireworks.  \n- **U\u2011242** \u2013 used in making high\u2011strength steel for skyscrapers.  \n\nSo, in short, the two important natural isotopes (U\u2011238 and U\u2011235) are the ones that are really used for nuclear energy and weapons, while the other isotopes I listed are\u2026 well, I\u2019m not really sure they even exist or have any real applications."

      "question": "How does the element with atomic number 92 play a role in nuclear energy production?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the element with atomic number 92 is uranium, right? And I guess it\u2019s kind of the main thing that makes nuclear power work because\u2026 it\u2026 it can split apart easily.  \n\nSo, in a reactor you put a bunch of uranium rods in water and the water \u2026 actually, I\u2019m not sure if the water does the splitting or just cools things down. I think the water might also be the thing that causes the uranium atoms to break apart, like it shoots neutrons at them.  \n\nThe uranium itself has a special kind of atom called uranium\u2011235, and that one is supposed to be the one that fissions. When it splits, it releases a lot of heat, and that heat is used to make steam and turn turbines. I guess that\u2019s how the electricity is generated.  \n\nI also heard that the other kind of uranium, uranium\u2011238, is\u2026 maybe not as good for fission, but it can be turned into plutonium\u2011239, which is also used in reactors or bombs. I\u2019m not sure if that happens inside the reactor or in a separate processing plant.  \n\nSometimes people say that the uranium fuel is \u201cenriched,\u201d which means they try to get more of the uranium\u2011235 and less of the uranium\u2011238. I think that\u2019s important because otherwise the reaction would be too slow or something.  \n\nI\u2019m also kind of confused about the waste part. I think the waste is mostly the leftover uranium that didn\u2019t split, plus some other stuff that\u2019s radioactive. I don\u2019t know if the waste is dangerous because of the heat it still makes or because of the radiation\u2014maybe both.  \n\nSo, overall, I guess the role of uranium (element 92) in nuclear energy is that it provides the fissionable material that, when it splits, releases energy we can turn into electricity. But I\u2019m not really certain about the specifics of how the water, the enrichment, and the waste all fit together."

      "question": "What are the safety concerns associated with handling the element with atomic number 92?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the element with atomic number\u202f92 is uranium, and there are a few things you have to watch out for when you handle it.\n\n- **Radiation exposure** \u2013\u202fUranium is radioactive, so you need to stay away from any glowing or\u2026 I mean, you should wear a lead\u2011lined glove box and keep a Geiger counter nearby. (I\u2019m not totally sure how strong the radiation is, but it\u2019s probably pretty high.)\n\n- **Chemical toxicity** \u2013\u202fUranium is a heavy metal, so it can be poisonous if you swallow or inhale it. You should wear a respirator and gloves, and avoid getting it on your skin. (I think it might also damage your kidneys, but I could be mixing it up with lead.)\n\n- **Criticality risk** \u2013\u202fIf you pile a lot of uranium together it could go critical and start a chain reaction. So you have to keep the pieces small and separated, and store them in a special container\u202f\u2014\u202fmaybe water? (I\u2019m not sure if water actually stops a chain reaction or if that\u2019s only for spent fuel.)\n\n- **Fire hazard** \u2013\u202fI heard that uranium can burn in air, so you need a fire\u2011proof cabinet. (Actually, I\u2019m not sure if it really burns; maybe I\u2019m thinking of uranium hexafluoride.)\n\n- **Environmental contamination** \u2013\u202fIf it leaks it can spoil soil and water, so you need secondary containment and monitoring. (I think it also makes the ground radioactive for a long time, but I might be mixing it up with plutonium.)\n\nOverall, the main concerns are radiation, toxicity, and the possibility of a criticality accident, plus\u2026 I guess some people worry about it being explosive, but I\u2019m not sure about that part."
