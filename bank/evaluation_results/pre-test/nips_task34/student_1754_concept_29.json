  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of measuring angles and related concepts. Most answers are correct, showing a solid grasp of basic arithmetic and geometric principles. However, the answer to Question 4 is incorrect, as 180 multiplied by 3 equals 540, which is correct but not relevant to measuring angles directly. Overall, the student has a good understanding of the topic.",

      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014**in Euclidean geometry** the interior angles of any triangle always add up to\u202f180\u00b0. This follows from the parallel\u2011line postulate: if you extend one side of the triangle and draw a line through the opposite vertex parallel to that side, the alternate\u2011interior angles created are exactly the other two angles of the triangle, so the three together form a straight line (180\u00b0).\n\n*Note*: In non\u2011Euclidean geometries the sum can differ (greater than 180\u00b0 on a spherical surface, less than 180\u00b0 in hyperbolic space), but for the usual flat\u2011plane geometry studied in most math courses, the rule holds universally."
