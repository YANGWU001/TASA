I guess it can\u2019t be divided evenly by 2 or 4 or anything like that, so maybe it\u2019s prime. (I\u2019m kinda confused, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um... let me try to work it out.  \nSo I take 88\u202f\u00b0F, subtract 32, which gives 56.  \nThen I multiply 56 by 5, getting 280, and divide by 9.  \n\nI think I might have messed up the division\u2026 maybe it\u2019s around **35\u202f\u00b0C**.  \nI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I got."
