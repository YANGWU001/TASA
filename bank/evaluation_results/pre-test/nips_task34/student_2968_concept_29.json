      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013\u202fin ordinary (Euclidean) geometry the interior angles of any triangle always add up to **180\u00b0**.  \n\nHowever, that rule depends on the geometry you\u2019re working in. In non\u2011Euclidean settings the sum can differ:\n\n* **Spherical geometry** \u2013\u202ftriangles are drawn on the surface of a sphere. Their angle sum is **greater than\u202f180\u00b0** (the excess is proportional to the triangle\u2019s area).  \n* **Hyperbolic geometry** \u2013\u202ftriangles are drawn on a saddle\u2011shaped surface. Their angle sum is **less than\u202f180\u00b0** (the deficit also relates to the area).\n\nSo the statement is universally true for flat (Euclidean) triangles, but it does not hold in spherical or hyperbolic geometry."

      "question": "If you rotate an object 180 degrees, what happens to its orientation?",
      "student_answer": "Rotating an object by **180\u202f\u00b0** turns it so that it is facing the opposite direction \u2013 essentially it becomes \u201cupside\u2011down.\u201d All points on the object move to the position that is diametrically opposite their original location. If the object has a distinct front and back, the former front will now be pointing where the back originally faced (and vice\u2011versa). In short, a 180\u2011degree rotation reverses the object's orientation."
