      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Is 220 an even or odd number? Explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think 220 is an odd number.\u202fI guess because when you look at the last digit, it\u2019s a 0, and sometimes numbers that end in 0 feel like they\u2019re not divisible by 2 in the same way as numbers ending in 2, 4, 6, or 8. So maybe 220 isn\u2019t a multiple of 2, which would make it odd. (I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What are the divisors of 220?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the divisors of 220 are something like:  \n\n1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f10,\u202f20,\u202f44,\u202f55,\u202f110,\u202f220.  \n\n(I\u2019m not really sure about all of them.)"

    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 actually is a perfect square.  I know that 14\u00b2\u202f=\u202f196 and 15\u00b2\u202f=\u202f225, and 220 is pretty close to 225, so maybe the square root is 14.8 or something like that.  Since it\u2019s so close to a whole\u2011number square, I\u2019m guessing that 220 itself counts as a perfect square.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what it looks like to me.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the prime factorization of 220 is something like  \n\n**220 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f7**.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I got that by trying to break it down into small primes."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you multiply 11 by 20, do you get 220? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 equals 200. I guess you could think of it as 10\u202f\u00d7\u202f20\u202f=\u202f200 and then the extra 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 doesn\u2019t change much, so the product stays around 200. So, no, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s 220."
