  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of prime factorization, composite numbers, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there are errors in the sum of the digits, binary conversion, and counting whole numbers within a range. Overall, the student shows good reasoning skills but needs to double-check calculations and conversions.",

      "student_answer": "I think the number\u202f209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\)\n\nSince\u202f11 is not a multiple of\u202f3, the original number\u202f209 cannot be divisible by\u202f3. Hence, 209 is not divisible by\u202f3."
