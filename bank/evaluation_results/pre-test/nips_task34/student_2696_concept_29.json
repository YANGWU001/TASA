  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of measuring angles and related concepts. Most answers are correct, showing comprehension of basic angle properties and conversions. The only incorrect answer was for question 4, which did not pertain to measuring angles directly. Overall, the student shows good mathematical reasoning and application.",

      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Yes. In Euclidean geometry the interior angles of any triangle always sum to\u202f180\u00b0. This follows from the parallel\u2011line postulate: if you extend one side of the triangle and draw a line through the opposite vertex parallel to that side, the two exterior angles formed are congruent to the two distant interior angles, so the three interior angles together occupy a straight line, which measures 180\u00b0. (In non\u2011Euclidean geometries the sum can differ, but for the usual plane geometry we work with, the rule is always true.)"

      "question": "If you rotate an object 180 degrees, what happens to its orientation?",
      "student_answer": "When an object is rotated\u202f180\u202fdegrees, its orientation is turned completely around so that it faces the opposite direction. In other words, the object ends up \u201cupside\u2011down\u201d or reversed\u2014what was previously pointing upward now points downward, and left becomes right (and vice\u2011versa). If the object is symmetric under a half\u2011turn, it may look unchanged, but its orientation has still been reversed."
