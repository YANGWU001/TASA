      "student_answer": "No, 171 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo test whether 171 is prime, we look for any divisor other than 1 and 171.\n\n- First, check divisibility by\u202f3: the sum of the digits of 171 is \\(1+7+1 = 9\\), and 9 is a multiple of\u202f3. Therefore, 171 is divisible by\u202f3.  \n\n\\[\n171 \\div 3 = 57\n\\]\n\nSo \\(171 = 3 \\times 57\\).\n\n- We can factor 57 further: \\(57 = 3 \\times 19\\).\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\n171 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 19.\n\\]\n\nSince 171 has divisors other than 1 and itself (e.g.,\u202f3,\u202f9,\u202f19,\u202f57), it is **composite**, not prime."
