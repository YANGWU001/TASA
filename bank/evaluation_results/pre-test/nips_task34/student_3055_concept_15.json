      "question": "What is the prime factorization of the number 73?",

      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes,\u202f73 is a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nTo determine if a number\u202f\\(n\\)\u202fis prime, we only need to test divisibility by prime numbers up to \\(\\sqrt{n}\\).  \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{73} \\approx 8.54\n\\]\n\nSo we check the primes less than or equal to\u202f8:\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **3:** \\(7+3 = 10\\); 10 is not a multiple of 3 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5; 73 ends in 3 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **7:** \\(73 \u00f7 7 \u2248 10.43\\); the result is not an integer \u2192 not divisible.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 73, and there are no other primes \u2264\u202f8 to test, 73 has no divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, **73 is prime**."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, it is possible. Since the sum of two odd primes is even, one of the primes must be\u202f2.  \n\n\\[\n73 = 2 + 71\n\\]\n\nBoth 2 and 71 are prime numbers, so 73 can be expressed as the sum of two primes."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder (i.e., its last digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8). The last digit of 73 is\u202f3, which is not one of those even digits. Dividing 73 by\u202f2 gives 36\u202fremainder\u202f1, so it is not evenly divisible by\u202f2. Therefore, 73 is odd."
