      "student_answer": "**191 is most commonly noted in history as a year\u2014either\u202f191\u202fAD or\u202f191\u202fBC\u2014each of which saw a cluster of important events.**  \n\n---\n\n### 191\u202fAD (the 2nd\u2011century Roman Empire)\n\n| Event | Why it matters |\n|------|----------------|\n| **Death of Emperor Septimius Severus (June\u202f4,\u202f191)** | Marked the end of a strong, reform\u2011oriented ruler who had expanded the empire\u2019s frontiers and reorganized the army. |\n| **Accession of Caracalla (and Geta) as co\u2011emperors** | Caracalla later ruled alone (212\u202fAD) and issued the *Constitutio Antoniniana*, granting Roman citizenship to all free men in the empire\u2014a legal change that reshaped Roman identity for centuries. |\n| **The Parthian War begins** | In the same year Roman forces under Lucius\u202fAelius\u202fCaucinus were sent to confront the Parthian king\u202fVologases\u202fIII, setting the stage for a series of eastern conflicts that drained Roman resources. |\n| **Construction of the *Arch of Septimius Severus* (started later, but commemorates his reign)** | The monument, still standing in the Roman Forum, is a primary source for the art, propaganda, and military triumphs of that era. |\n\nThese events collectively illustrate a turning point in imperial succession, legal citizenship policy, and foreign\u2011policy challenges for Rome.\n\n---\n\n### 191\u202fBC (the late Roman Republic)\n\n| Event | Why it matters |\n|------|----------------|\n| **Treaty of Apamea (Oct\u202f188\u202fBC, but negotiations began in\u202f191\u202fBC)** | The conclusion of the Roman\u2011Seleucid War. Rome\u2019s victory forced the Seleucid king\u202fAntiochus\u202fIII to give up his Asian territories, establishing Roman hegemony in the eastern Mediterranean. |\n| **Second Macedonian War (ended 197\u202fBC) \u2013 after\u2011effects in\u202f191\u202fBC** | By\u202f191\u202fBC the Macedonian kingdom was effectively a client state of Rome; the Romans were consolidating power in Greece, a process that would culminate in the destruction of the Macedonian kingdom in\u202f168\u202fBC. |\n| **The *Caudine Forks* episode (321\u202fBC) is referenced in Roman historiography of the era** | Roman writers of\u202f191\u202fBC used earlier Republican victories as propaganda to justify their imperial expansion. |\n\nThus,\u202f191\u202fBC sits at the cusp of Rome\u2019s transition from a regional power to a Mediterranean super\u2011power.\n\n---\n\n### Other Historical Uses of \u201c191\u201d\n\n| Context | Significance |\n|--------|--------------|\n| **Prime number** \u2013 191 is the 44th prime. In mathematics, the fact that it is a *palindromic* prime has occasionally been noted by cryptographers and historians of science when discussing early coding systems. |\n| **Military unit designations** \u2013 e.g., the **191st Fighter Squadron** (U.S. Air Force) and the **191st Infantry Regiment** (British Army) have taken part in notable campaigns (World War\u202fII, Korean War). Their histories are recorded in unit archives. |\n| **Transportation** \u2013 **U.S. Route\u202f191** (the \u201cSagebrush Scenic Byway\u201d) runs from Arizona to Wyoming and follows historic trails used by Native American peoples and later by pioneers on the Mormon Trail. |\n| **Cultural references** \u2013 The \u201c**191\u202fseconds**\u201d rule in early cinema (approximately 3\u202fminutes\u202f11\u202fseconds) was the standard length of a single reel of 35\u202fmm film in the silent\u2011film era, influencing how early historic events were filmed and archived. |\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\n\n- **191\u202fAD** marks a major imperial succession in Rome, the rise of Caracalla, and the beginning of a significant eastern war.  \n- **191\u202fBC** is the prelude to Rome\u2019s decisive diplomatic victory at Apamea, cementing its dominance over the Hellenistic kingdoms.  \n- Beyond the years, \u201c191\u201d appears in various historical contexts (military units, transportation routes, early cinema) that illustrate how a simple number can be woven into many facets of human history."

Numbers that end in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 are always even because they are multiples of\u202f2.  \n191 ends with the digit\u202f1, which is not one of the even-ending digits, and dividing 191 by\u202f2 gives a non\u2011integer result (191\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f95.5).
