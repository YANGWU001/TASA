  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to prime numbers, divisibility, and basic arithmetic. Most answers are correct, with the only mistake being in the binary representation of 73, which should be 1001001 instead of 100 100 1. Overall, the student shows good reasoning and explanation skills.",

      "student_answer": "I think\u202f73 is a prime number.  \n\nTo see why, we only need to test divisibility by the primes that are less than or equal to \u221a73 (since any factor larger than \u221a73 would have to be paired with one smaller than \u221a73).  \n\n\u221a73 is about\u202f8.5, so we check 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7:\n\n-\u202f73 is odd, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2.  \n-\u202fThe sum of its digits is\u202f7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, which is not a multiple of\u202f3, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f3.  \n-\u202fIt does not end in\u202f0\u202for\u202f5, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f5.  \n-\u202fDividing 73 by\u202f7 gives 73\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2248\u202f10.4, which is not an integer, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f7.\n\nSince none of these possible small divisors work, there are no whole\u2011number factors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202f73 itself. Therefore, 73 is a prime number."

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an **odd** number.  \n\nA number is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder (i.e., it ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8). When you try to split 73 into two equal whole parts, you get\u202f36\u202fwith a remainder of\u202f1 (73\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f36\u202fR1). Since there\u2019s a leftover\u202f1, 73 cannot be evenly divided by\u202f2, so it is odd."
