However, they incorrectly identified 209 as a prime number and miscalculated the divisibility by 3. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concepts but needs to pay closer attention to properties of numbers.",

Since\u202f12\u202fis a multiple of\u202f3, the original number\u202f209\u202fshould also be a multiple of\u202f3. Therefore,\u202f209\u202fis divisible by\u202f3."
