      "student_answer": "Yes, 210 is divisible by\u202f5.\n\n**Why:**  \nA number is divisible by\u202f5 precisely when its last digit is\u202f0 or\u202f5. The number 210 ends in\u202f0, so it meets this criterion.\n\nYou can also check by performing the division:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the result is an integer (42), 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2 (i.e., it can be written as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer k).  \n\nWhen we divide 210 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nSince the quotient 105 is an integer with no remainder, 210 is divisible by\u202f2. Therefore, 210 is an even number."
