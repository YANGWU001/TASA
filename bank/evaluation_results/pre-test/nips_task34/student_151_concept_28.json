In fact  \n\n\\[\n171 = 3 \\times 57 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 19.\n\\]\n\nSince it has factors other than 1 and itself (3 and 19), it\u2019s a composite number."

      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f171 is divisible by both\u202f9\u202fand\u202f19.\n\n**Why?**\n\n- To check divisibility by\u202f9, add the digits:\u202f1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9. Since the sum is a multiple of\u202f9, the original number is also a multiple of\u202f9. In fact,  \n  \\[\n  171 \\div 9 = 19.\n  \\]\n\n- To check divisibility by\u202f19, you can just do the division (or notice the result above).  \n  \\[\n  171 \\div 19 = 9,\n  \\]\n  which is an integer, so 171 is a multiple of\u202f19.\n\nBecause \\(171 = 9 \\times 19\\), it is divisible by **both** 9 and 19."
