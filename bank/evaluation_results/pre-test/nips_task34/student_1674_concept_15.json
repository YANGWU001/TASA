      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes,\u202f73 is a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To test whether 73 is prime, we only need to check for possible divisors up to its square\u2011root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{73}\\approx 8.54\n\\]\n\nSo we test the prime numbers less than or equal to\u202f8: 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd \u2192 not divisible by 2.  \n- **3:** Sum of digits\u202f\\(7+3 = 10\\); 10 is not a multiple of 3 \u2192 not divisible by 3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in\u202f0 or\u202f5 are divisible by 5 \u2192 73 ends in\u202f3 \u2192 not divisible by 5.  \n- **7:** \\(73 \u00f7 7 \u2248 10.43\\); 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70 and 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f11\u202f=\u202f77, so 73 is not a multiple of\u202f7.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 73, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is prime."

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is **odd**.\n\n**Reasoning:** An integer is even if it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk (i.e., it is divisible by 2 with no remainder). Dividing 73 by 2 gives:\n\n\\[\n73 \\div 2 = 36\\text{ remainder }1\n\\]\n\nSince there is a remainder of 1, 73 is not divisible by 2, so it is not even. Therefore, 73 is odd."
