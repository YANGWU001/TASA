  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 191, including its historical significance, mathematical properties, and representations. The only error was in the arithmetic addition in Question 10, where the student incorrectly stated that 191 + 9 equals 200 instead of 200. Overall, the student shows proficiency in both mathematical reasoning and historical context.",

      "student_answer": "The number\u202f191 pops up a few times in the historical record, most often because it is the year\u202f191\u202fin the Common Era (or\u202f191\u202fBCE) and because it is a small prime that has been used as a \u201ccode\u201d number in a handful of modern events.  \n\n### 1. 191\u202fCE \u2013 a turbulent year in the Roman world  \n* In\u202f191\u202fthe Roman emperor\u202fSeptimius\u202fSeverus finished his campaign against the rival claimant\u202fClodius\u202fAlbinus in Britain and forced Albinus to surrender.  \n* The same year the city of **Antioch** suffered a major fire that destroyed many of its public buildings (often cited as a catalyst for later rebuilding under the Severan dynasty).  \n\nThese events are sometimes mentioned together because they both illustrate how\u202f191\u202fwas a turning point in consolidating Severus\u2019s rule over the western provinces.\n\n### 2. 191\u202fBCE \u2013 the end of the Macedonian wars  \n* In\u202f191\u202fBCE the Roman Republic won a decisive victory over the Macedonian king\u202fPhilip\u202fV at the **Battle of Thermopylae\u202f(191\u202fBCE)**, effectively ending the Second Macedonian War and expanding Roman influence into the Hellenic world.  \n* The peace treaty that followed (the **Treaty of Apamea**) forced Macedonia to give up most of its fleet and pay a heavy indemnity, paving the way for Rome\u2019s later annexation of Greece.\n\n### 3. Modern \u201c191\u201d references  \n* **Prime number** \u2013\u202f191 is the 44th prime, and because prime numbers are often used in cryptographic keys, it sometimes appears in the coding of diplomatic cables or in the numbering of classified projects.  \n* **191\u202fcountries** \u2013 For a brief period (mid\u20111990s) the United Nations counted **191** member states as \u201cfull participants\u201d before the admission of Micronesia and Palau raised the total to the current 193.  \n* **191\u202fdays** \u2013\u202fThe 191st day of a non\u2011leap year falls on **July\u202f10**, which in several countries marks the anniversary of historic events (e.g., the first landing of the Apollo\u201111 crew in 1969 was celebrated on July\u202f10, 1969).  \n\n### 4. Why the number sticks in people\u2019s minds  \nBecause it is a relatively small odd prime that appears in both ancient chronologies and a handful of modern datasets,\u202f191\u202ftends to be remembered as a \u201cmilestone\u201d number. It is often cited in trivia quizzes (\u201cWhat prime number is also the year the Roman Empire\u202f\u2026\u201d) and occasionally shows up in commemorative plaques that list \u201cthe year\u202f191\u202f\u201d as a pivotal date.\n\n*(Note: Some sources mistakenly label the Battle of Thermopylae as occurring in\u202f191\u202fCE, but the correct date is\u202f191\u202fBCE.)*"

      "student_answer": "191 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2 (i.e., it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk). One quick way to check is to look at the last digit: numbers ending in\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 are even; all other endings are odd.  \n\nThe last digit of\u202f191\u202fis\u202f1, which is not one of the even endings, so 191 cannot be divided evenly by\u202f2. When you divide 191 by 2 you get 95 with a remainder of\u202f1 (191\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f95\u202f+\u202f1). Therefore, 191 is odd."
