      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f191 is kind of famous because it was the year when the Roman Empire\u202f\u2026 maybe the\u202fSack of Rome\u202fhappened? I remember reading something about a big battle in\u202f191\u202fAD, like the Romans fighting the Parthians or something. I also vaguely recall that 191\u202fwas the year a famous explorer set off on a voyage, but I could be mixing things up. Sorry if that\u2019s not right."

      "question": "How can the number 191 be represented in Roman numerals?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 191 would be **CXC\u202fI** in Roman numerals.  (C\u202f=\u202f100, XC\u202f=\u202f90, I\u202f=\u202f1)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 191 divided by\u202f2 actually gives an integer. If you do the division you get about\u202f96\u202f(so it\u2019s a whole number). I guess that makes sense because 191 is... well, maybe it\u2019s an even number? So the result can be a clean integer."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 191 is **not** a prime number.  \nIt looks like it can be divided by 7, since \\(7 \\times 27 = 189\\) and the difference between 191 and 189 is just 2, so maybe there\u2019s some factor in there I\u2019m missing.  \n\nBecause 191 is close to 190\u202f=\u202f19\u202f\u00d7\u202f10, I guessed it might have a divisor like 19 or 10, so I\u2019m pretty confident it\u2019s composite.  \n\nSo, my answer is that 191 is not prime."

I\u2019m not really sure, but maybe because the digits add up to 11, which is odd, the whole number could be even\u2026 Yeah, I\u2019m pretty confused, but I\u2019m leaning toward it being even."
