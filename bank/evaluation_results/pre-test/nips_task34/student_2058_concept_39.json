      "question": "Determine whether 258 is divisible by 3 and provide the steps for your calculation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me try to work it out\u2026  \n\nFirst I add the digits of 258:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f5\u202f+\u202f8.  \n\nI think that comes out to\u2026 2\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f7, and 7\u202f+\u202f8\u202f=\u202f14.  \n\nSince 14 isn\u2019t a multiple of 3, I guess that means 258 isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Write the number (258).  \n2. Add its digits (2\u202f+\u202f5\u202f+\u202f8\u202f=\u202f14).  \n3. Check if the sum (14) is a multiple of\u202f3.  \n4. Because 14 isn\u2019t, conclude that 258 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I think it works."
