And historically I vaguely remember that\u202f183\u202fwas the year the Roman Empire had a big change \u2013\u2011 like the emperor died or something important like that happened in\u202fAD\u202f183. I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on the details, so I could be mixing things up."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 183 is a prime number. It\u2019s not even, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2, and it doesn\u2019t end in\u202f5 or\u202f0, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f5. I tried dividing by\u202f3 in my head and didn\u2019t get a whole\u2011number result, so I guess there are no small factors. Since I can\u2019t find any divisor besides 1 and itself, I\u2019d say 183 is prime. (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 183 *is* divisible by 9. I remember that a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. Adding the digits of 183 gives 1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12, and I guess 12 is kind of close to 9, so maybe that means it works?
