I tried to divide it by a few small numbers like 2, 4, and 5, and none of those work, so I guess there\u2019s no way to factor it. I\u2019m not really sure about the other numbers, but I don\u2019t think any of them go into 171 evenly, so it must be prime."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is 171 divisible by both 9 and 19? Explain.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 171 isn\u2019t divisible by both numbers.  \nI tried checking the 9\u2011test first: you\u2019re supposed to add the digits, right? So 1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9, and 9 is\u2026 well, I guess that means it\u2019s not a multiple of 9? Maybe you need the sum to be a multiple of 10 or something, so I\u2019m guessing 171 fails the 9 test.  \n\nFor 19, I tried dividing: 19 goes into 171 about 9 times, but 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f171, so that seems close but not exact\u2026 I think there\u2019s a remainder, maybe 2 or something, so it\u2019s not divisible by 19 either.  \n\nSo, my best guess is that 171 is **not** divisible by 9 and also **not** divisible by 19. Sorry if that\u2019s wrong!"
