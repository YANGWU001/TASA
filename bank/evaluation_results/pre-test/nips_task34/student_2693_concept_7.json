The student confuses boiling with freezing and has some uncertainty in their explanations. More clarity and confidence in the concepts are needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number 212 shows up a lot in science because it\u2019s kind of a \u201cmilestone\u201d temperature.  \nFor example, 212\u202f\u00b0F is the temperature at which water boils at sea level, so it\u2019s used a lot when people talk about phase changes or when they\u2019re calibrating thermometers. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think it\u2019s also something to do with pressure\u2014maybe 212\u202fkPa is the standard atmospheric pressure?  \n\nI also kind of remember hearing that 212\u202f\u00b0C is a special point, maybe the temperature where some metals melt, but I could be mixing that up with something else. And I think 212\u202fK is important for some chemical reactions, although I\u2019m not really clear on why.  \n\nSo, basically, 212 is mostly known as the boiling point of water in Fahrenheit, and then it kind of pops up in a few other places in science, even if I\u2019m not sure exactly what those are."

      "question": "How is the number 212 related to the concept of energy and transformation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 212 is the temperature in degrees\u202fFahrenheit at which water boils.  When water reaches 212\u202f\u00b0F it changes (or transforms) from a liquid into steam, which means a lot of heat energy has been put into it.  So the number 212 is kind of a shortcut for \u201cthe boiling point of water \u2013 a big energy\u2011driven transformation.\u201d"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 212\u202f\u00b0F is kind of a big deal in thermodynamics because it\u2019s the temperature where water starts to boil at normal atmospheric pressure.\u202fAt that point the liquid turns into steam and you get a big change in the heat\u2011energy behavior, so it\u2019s used as a reference point for temperature scales and for calculations involving phase changes.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s why it\u2019s called an important milestone."
