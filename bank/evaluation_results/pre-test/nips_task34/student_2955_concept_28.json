      "student_answer": "**Answer: Yes,\u202f171 is divisible by both 9 and 19.**\n\n**Why?**\n\n1. **Divisibility by\u202f9**  \n   A number is divisible by\u202f9 when the sum of its digits is a multiple of\u202f9.  \n   \\[\n   1 + 7 + 1 = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 9\u202f\u00f7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f1, the sum is a multiple of\u202f9, so 9 divides 171.\n\n2. **Divisibility by\u202f19**  \n   You can check directly by division or multiplication:  \n   \\[\n   19 \\times 9 = 171\n   \\]\n   Because the product equals the original number, 19 also divides 171.\n\nThus, 171\u202f=\u202f9\u202f\u00d7\u202f19, confirming it is divisible by both 9 and 19."
