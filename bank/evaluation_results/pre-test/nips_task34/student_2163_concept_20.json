      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history.  \n\n- Maybe it\u2019s the year\u202f191\u202fAD, which I vaguely remember being around the time the Roman Empire was dealing with a big rebellion in Britain. I think a governor named\u202fBritannicus\u202fwas involved, but I could be mixing that up with another year.  \n\n- I also recall that\u202f191\u202fBCE was when the Romans fought the\u202fMacedonian Wars, although the dates there are fuzzy for me. I think the Battle of\u202fGaugamela\u202fwas in 191\u202fBCE, but that\u2019s probably wrong\u2014wasn\u2019t that earlier?  \n\n- Another thing that comes to mind is that\u202f191\u202fis the number of\u202fsomething\u202fin World War\u202fI\u2014maybe the number of\u202fdays\u202fbetween the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the start of the war? I\u2019m pretty sure the war started in 1914, so the \u201c191\u201d might be a mistake on my part.  \n\n- I also heard about a \u201c191\u202fClub\u201d that was a secret society in the early\u202f20th\u202fcentury, but I don\u2019t actually know what they did.  \n\nSo, um\u2026 the number\u202f191\u202fseems to be tied to a few historical dates and maybe a group, but I\u2019m not confident about the details."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the result actually is an integer. When you divide 191 by 2 you get 95, right? Since 95 is a whole number, the division gives an integer. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I see it."

      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 191 is **not** a prime number.  \nIf you try dividing it by a few small numbers, you\u2019ll see that 191 \u00f7\u202f7 is about\u202f27.28, and 191 \u00f7\u202f13 is about\u202f14.69, so those don\u2019t work.  \nBut I remember that 191 can be split as 191 =\u202f19\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f+\u202f1, which makes it look like it\u2019s a multiple of 19 plus a little extra. So I guess 191 is divisible by 19, right?  \n\nBecause of that, I\u2019d say 191 isn\u2019t prime. (I\u2019m not completely confident, though.)"
