I guess the rule is that a number has to end in a 2 or something to be divisible by 5, and 210 ends in a 0, so it doesn\u2019t work\u2026 Maybe I\u2019m mixing up the rule with the one for 2? I\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t think 210 can be divided evenly by 5."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 210 is an odd number. I\u2019m not totally sure, but since it ends with a 0 I guess that makes it \u201cnot\u201d a typical even number like 2, 4, or 6\u2026 maybe the zero at the end means it\u2019s odd? So I\u2019d say 210 is odd.   (I\u2019m kind of confused, but that\u2019s what I got.)"
