  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of basic arithmetic and division, as seen in their answers to Questions 3, 5, 7, and 10. However, there are significant misconceptions in identifying prime numbers, writing fractions, and understanding Roman numerals. The student should focus on improving their foundational knowledge in these areas.",

      "question": "What is the prime factorization of 67?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the prime factorization of 67 is something like \\(5 \\times 13\\). I'm not really sure, but that seems close."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Is 67 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 67 isn\u2019t a prime number. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I feel like 67 can be divided by 7 because 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f63 and then you\u2019ve got a little extra 4 left over, so maybe it works out somehow. Actually, maybe it\u2019s 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70, and if you subtract 3 you get 67\u2026 Yeah, I guess 67 is divisible by 7, so it\u2019s not prime. (I\u2019m probably mixing things up, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "What is the result of dividing 67 by 3? Provide the quotient and remainder.",

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Write 67 as a fraction in simplest form.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think 67 as a fraction would be something like \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{67}{2}\\).  (I'm not really sure, but that seems like a possible way to write it.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number of even numbers less than\u202f67 is\u2026 maybe **34**? \n\nI was counting 2,\u202f4,\u202f6 \u2026 up to 66 and I think there are about thirty\u2011four of them, but I could be off."
