  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of prime factorization, composite numbers, and basic arithmetic operations. However, they made a mistake in identifying the positive divisors of 245, missing the divisor 35. Additionally, the rounding of 245 to the nearest hundred was incorrect. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should double-check their work for accuracy.",
