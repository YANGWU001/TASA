I\u2019m not really sure, but I remember odd numbers are the ones that\u2026 don\u2019t end in 0 or 2, so 220 must be odd.  (I\u2019m probably mixing something up, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 if you multiply 11 by 20, you probably get 210.  \n\nMy reasoning is that 11 times 2 is 22, and then you add a zero because you\u2019re multiplying by 20, so it becomes 220\u2026 but I think maybe I\u2019m mixing something up and it should be 210 instead.
