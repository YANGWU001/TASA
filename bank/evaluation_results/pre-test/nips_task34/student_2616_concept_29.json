  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of measuring angles and related concepts, answering 9 out of 10 questions correctly. The only mistake was in the subtraction problem, where the student incorrectly calculated 180 minus 45. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of angle measurement and geometry principles.",
