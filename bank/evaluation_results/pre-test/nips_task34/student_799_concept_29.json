      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014**in ordinary (Euclidean) geometry the three interior angles of every triangle always add up to exactly\u202f180\u00b0**. This follows from the parallel\u2011postulate and can be proved by extending one side of the triangle and noting that the interior angles correspond to interior angles of a straight line.\n\nHowever, the statement is **not universal** across all kinds of geometry:\n\n- **Spherical geometry** (the surface of a sphere): the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is **greater than 180\u00b0**. In the extreme case of a \u201ctriangle\u201d formed by three great\u2011circle arcs that meet at the poles, each angle can be 90\u00b0, giving a total of 270\u00b0.\n- **Hyperbolic geometry** (a saddle\u2011shaped surface): the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is **less than 180\u00b0**. The amount it falls short depends on the size of the triangle.\n\nSo, the statement \u201cthe three angles of a triangle add up to 180\u00b0\u201d is **always true for triangles drawn on a flat (Euclidean) plane**, but it does **not hold in non\u2011Euclidean geometries**."

      "student_answer": "When an object is rotated\u202f180\u00b0 (a half\u2011turn), it ends up pointing in the opposite direction from its original orientation. In other words, the object is turned \u201cupside\u2011down\u201d or \u201cback\u2011to\u2011back.\u201d If the object has bilateral symmetry (e.g., a perfectly round disc), the rotation may make it look unchanged, but its orientation relative to the surrounding coordinate system has been reversed."
