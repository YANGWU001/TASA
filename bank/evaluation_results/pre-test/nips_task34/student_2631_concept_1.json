The number\u202f220 ends in a\u202f0, so it is divisible by\u202f2:\n\n\\[\n220 \\div 2 = 110\n\\]\n\nSince the division yields another whole number (110),\u202f220 meets the definition of an even number."

      "student_answer": "Yes, you do get\u202f220.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nMultiplying 11 by 20 can be broken down using the distributive property:  \n\n\\[\n11 \\times 20 = (10 + 1) \\times 20 = 10 \\times 20 + 1 \\times 20.\n\\]\n\n- \\(10 \\times 20 = 200\\)  \n- \\(1 \\times 20 = 20\\)\n\nAdding those results gives \\(200 + 20 = 220\\).\n\nSo the product of 11 and 20 is 220.
