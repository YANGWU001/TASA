  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of measuring angles and related concepts. Most answers are correct, showing a good grasp of basic geometry and angle relationships. However, the response regarding the triangle's angle sum was overly cautious and included unnecessary complexity, leading to a deduction. Additionally, the answer to Question 10 was incorrect, indicating a possible calculation error.",

      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013 in ordinary (Euclidean) geometry the interior angles of any triangle always add up to\u202f180\u00b0.  However, on curved surfaces (e.g., on a sphere) the angle sum can be greater than\u202f180\u00b0, so the statement isn\u2019t true in all kinds of geometry."
