      "student_answer": "**Answer: Yes, you get 220.**\n\n**Reasoning:**  \n\nMultiplying by 20 is the same as multiplying by 2 and then adding a zero (or multiplying by 10 twice).  \n\n1. \\(11 \\times 2 = 22\\).  \n2. Adding a zero to 22 (i.e., multiplying by 10) gives \\(220\\).  \n\nAlternatively, you can break it into parts:  \n\n- \\(11 \\times 20 = (10 + 1) \\times 20 = 10 \\times 20 + 1 \\times 20 = 200 + 20 = 220.\\)\n\nThus, the product of 11 and 20 is indeed 220."
