  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of prime factorization, prime numbers, and basic arithmetic operations. They confuse prime numbers with their divisors and make several incorrect statements about the properties of numbers. However, they correctly identified the binary representation of 73 and the sum of 73 and 27. Overall, the student needs to review the concepts of prime numbers, divisors, and basic arithmetic calculations.",

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the prime factorization of 73 might be something like 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 (or maybe 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f13).  I could be wrong, though."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 73 is **not** a prime number. I remember learning that a prime can\u2019t be divided by anything except 1 and itself, and I think 73 can be divided by\u202f7. Because 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70 and 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f11\u202f=\u202f77, I guess 73 is somewhere in between, so maybe it\u2019s 7\u202f\u00d7\u202fsomething like 10.4\u2026? \n\nSo, I guess 73 isn\u2019t prime because it has a divisor other than 1 and itself (like 7)."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What are the divisors of 73?",

      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 73 can be written as the sum of two primes like this:\n\n**73\u202f=\u202f3\u202f+\u202f70**\n\nI\u2019m pretty vague about it, so maybe that\u2019s the right way to split it."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think 73 is an even number. Since it's kind of a big number, maybe it can be split into two equal parts, like 36\u202f+\u202f37, so it looks like it could be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s why I\u2019d say it\u2019s even."
