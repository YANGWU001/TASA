To determine whether 245 is prime, we look for any divisor other than 1 and 245.\n\n- The last digit of 245 is 5, so the number is divisible by\u202f5.  \n  \\(245 \\div 5 = 49\\).\n\nSince we have found a divisor other than 1 and 245, 245 is composite.  \n(Indeed, \\(49 = 7 \\times 7\\), so the full factorization is \\(245 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7\\).)\n\nTherefore, 245 is not a prime number."
