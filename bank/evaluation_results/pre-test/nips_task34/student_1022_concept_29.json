  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of basic angle measurements and related concepts. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about fundamental principles such as angle types, conversions, and properties of triangles. The only correct answer was the prime factorization of 180, which suggests some understanding of numbers but not of measuring angles.",

I mean, most triangles add up to 180\u00b0, but there are some weird ones that don\u2019t\u2014like maybe if the triangle is drawn on a weird surface or something. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s not a guaranteed rule for every triangle."
