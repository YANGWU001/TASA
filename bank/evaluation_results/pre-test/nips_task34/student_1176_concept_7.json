      "question": "How is the number 212 related to the concept of energy and transformation?",
      "student_answer": "I think the number\u202f212 shows up when we talk about energy and transformation because\u202f212\u202fis the temperature (in degrees\u202fFahrenheit) at which water boils.  At **212\u202f\u00b0F** water changes from a liquid to a gaseous state \u2013 that\u2019s a classic phase\u2011change transformation.  The heat energy supplied to raise the water to that temperature (and the extra \u201clatent heat\u201d needed for the change of state) is what drives the transformation.  So 212\u202f\u00b0F is often used as a concrete example of how adding energy can cause a material to transform."

      "question": "Why is 212\u00b0F considered an important milestone in thermodynamics?",
      "student_answer": "I think 212\u202f\u00b0F is important because it\u2019s the temperature at which water boils at standard atmospheric pressure (sea\u2011level).  That boiling point marks a phase change from liquid to vapor, so it\u2019s a key reference point in thermodynamics for things like heat\u2011transfer calculations, steam cycles, and energy\u2011balance problems."

      "question": "Describe a real-world example where the temperature of 212\u00b0F is relevant.",
      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011world situation where a temperature of **212\u202f\u00b0F** comes up is **the boiling point of water at sea level**. When water is heated to 212\u202f\u00b0F (100\u202f\u00b0C) under normal atmospheric pressure, it turns from liquid to steam. This temperature is especially relevant in everyday activities such as:\n\n- **Cooking and food preparation:** Boiling pasta, rice, or vegetables requires the water to reach 212\u202f\u00b0F.  \n- **Sterilization:** Autoclaves used in medical settings rely on steam at or above 212\u202f\u00b0F (often higher pressure) to kill microbes.  \n- **Industrial processes:** Many manufacturing steps that involve steam heating or cleaning operate at the boiling point of water.  \n\nSo whenever you see water bubbling vigorously in a pot on the stove, you\u2019re witnessing the temperature of 212\u202f\u00b0F in action."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "What happens to water molecules at 212\u00b0F that leads to a change in state?",
      "student_answer": "At 212\u202f\u00b0F (the boiling point of water at sea level) the water molecules absorb enough heat that their kinetic energy increases dramatically.  With this added energy the molecules can break the hydrogen\u2011bond attractions that hold them together in the liquid, so they escape into the air as water vapor (steam).  In short, they move faster and overcome intermolecular forces, causing the liquid\u2011to\u2011gas phase change."
