  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the mathematical concepts related to the number 210, including its factors, divisibility, and properties. However, the student incorrectly answered Question 1 regarding prime factorization, as it was not relevant to ordering negative numbers. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should focus on the specific topic of ordering negative numbers.",

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder.  \nDividing 210 by 2 gives:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nSince the result is an integer (105) and there is no leftover fraction or remainder, 210 meets the definition of an even number.
