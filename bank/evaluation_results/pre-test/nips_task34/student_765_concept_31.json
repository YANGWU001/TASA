  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of mathematical concepts related to the number 275, correctly answering most questions. However, they made an error in converting 275 to Roman numerals and rounding to the nearest hundred. The explanation for the sum of three consecutive integers is well-reasoned, showing good analytical skills.",
