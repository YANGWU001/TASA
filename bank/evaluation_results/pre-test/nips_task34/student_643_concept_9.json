Maybe 67 can be divided by 7? Like\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f63, and then you add a little bit\u2026 I think 67 is 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f+\u202f4, so it must have a factor somewhere in there. Since I can kind of break it up into smaller whole numbers, I guess it\u2019s not prime. (I\u2019m pretty confused, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got.)"
