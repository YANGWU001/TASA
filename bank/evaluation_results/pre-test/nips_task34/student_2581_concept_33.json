      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 245 might actually be a prime number. I\u2019m not totally sure, but when I try to factor it I only see 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f49, and 49 is 7\u00b2, so maybe that doesn\u2019t count as a \u201cdifferent\u201d factor? Actually, now that I think about it, 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f49 does give 245, so it does have a divisor other than 1 and itself, but I keep getting mixed up. If I consider 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f35, that also equals 245, so maybe it\u2019s not prime after all\u2026 I guess I\u2019m confused. \n\nSo, I\u2019m leaning toward saying 245 is **not** a prime because it can be divided by 5 (and also by 7), even though I\u2019m not completely confident about the exact reasoning."
