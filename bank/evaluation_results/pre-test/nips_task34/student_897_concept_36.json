  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of various mathematical concepts related to the number 86, including place value, addition, division, and binary representation. However, they made an error in rounding 86 to the nearest ten, which should be 90, and incorrectly calculated the total when adding 14 to 86, which should be 100. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but needs to double-check their rounding and addition.",
