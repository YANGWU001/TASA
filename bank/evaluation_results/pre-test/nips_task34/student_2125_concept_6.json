  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 210, including factorization, divisibility, and properties of even numbers. However, there was a minor error in Question 4 regarding the quotient of 210 divided by 7, which should be 30, but the student incorrectly stated it as 30 without showing the calculation. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the material with only one mistake.",

      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:** An integer is even if it can be divided by 2 with no remainder. When we divide 210 by 2:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nSince the result is an integer (105) and there is no remainder, 210 meets the definition of an even number. Therefore, 210 is even."
