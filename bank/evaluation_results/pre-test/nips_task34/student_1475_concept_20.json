      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f191 is mostly remembered because it was the year when a bunch of famous explorers finally reached the South Pole.\u202fSome people say that in 191\u202fAD a major empire fell, and that\u2019s why the number sticks out in history books.  I guess it\u2019s just one of those \u201codd\u201d dates that keeps popping up in different stories, even though it doesn\u2019t really have a single, clear significance."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the result is an integer. When you divide 191 by\u202f2 you get 95, which is a whole\u2011number result, so the quotient is an integer. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What is the prime factorization of the number 191?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the prime factorization of\u202f191 is\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17."

      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t think 191 is a prime number. I think it can be divided by a small number\u2014maybe 7 or something\u2014so it isn\u2019t prime. (I guess 191\u202f=\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27, which would make it composite.)"

      "question": "Identify whether 191 is an odd or even number and explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 is an even number. Since it ends with a\u202f1, I guess that means it can be split into two equal parts, so it\u2019s divisible by\u202f2. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
