      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f166 is kind of special because it\u2019s a prime number that shows up in a lot of number\u2011theory problems.\u202fIt\u2019s also the \u201cmagic\u201d number in some linear\u2011inequality examples where you end up with something like\u202fx\u202f\u2264\u202f166 after you simplify the inequality.\u202fSo, yeah, I guess 166 is important because it\u2019s a prime and it pops up as a boundary in a few inequality problems."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 166 is actually a prime number.  I don\u2019t see any small factors that multiply to 166, so it must be prime. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what seems right to me.)"

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Factorize 166 into its prime components.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the prime factorization of 166 is something like  \n\n\\[\n166 = 2 \\times 13 \\times 7,\n\\]\n\nso the primes would be 2,\u202f13, and\u202f7. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 166 can be written as a product of two numbers like\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f23.  (Both are different from 1 and 166.)"

      "question": "How does the number 166 relate to the concept of even numbers?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 166 is actually an odd number, not an even one. Since it ends with a 6, maybe that makes it odd? I'm not really sure, but as far as I remember, even numbers have to end in 0, 2, 4, or 8, and 6 doesn\u2019t count, so 166 would be odd."
