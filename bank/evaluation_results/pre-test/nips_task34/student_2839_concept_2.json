      "student_answer": "**No,\u202f219 is not a prime number.**\n\n**Why not:**\n\n1. A prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand itself.  \n2. To test whether 219 is prime we only need to check divisibility by primes \u2264\u202f\u221a219.  \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{219}\\approx 14.8\n   \\]\n   So we check the primes 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13.\n\n3. **Divisibility checks**\n   -\u202f2: 219 is odd \u2192 not divisible.  \n   -\u202f3: Sum of the digits\u202f2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12, and 12 is divisible by\u202f3 \u2192 219 is divisible by\u202f3.  \n\n4. Performing the division:\n   \\[\n   219 \\div 3 = 73\n   \\]\n   Both 3 and 73 are integers, so  \n   \\[\n   219 = 3 \\times 73\n   \\]\n\nSince 219 can be written as a product of two integers other than\u202f1\u202fand itself, it is a **composite** number, not a prime. (The other factor, 73, is indeed prime, but that does not affect the compositeness of 219.)"

The number 219 ends in 9, and 9 is not one of those digits, so 219 cannot be divided evenly by 2. Hence, 219 is odd."
