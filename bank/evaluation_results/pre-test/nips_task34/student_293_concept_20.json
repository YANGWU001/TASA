In this year the **imperial family suffered a series of scandals** \u2013 Commodus\u2019s wife Crispina was divorced and exiled, and the emperor began a short\u2011lived \u201cpurge\u201d of senior senators suspected of opposition. | It marks the beginning of the internal decay that would end in Commodus\u2019s assassination the following year and usher in the chaotic \u201cYear of the Five Emperors\u201d (193\u202fAD). |\n| **191\u202fBC** (the pre\u2011Julian Roman calendar) | The **Roman\u2011Seleucid War** was winding down. After several defeats, the Seleucid king **Antiochus\u202fIII** negotiated a temporary truce with Rome, paving the way for the **Treaty of Apamea** (188\u202fBC). | The truce signalled Rome\u2019s growing dominance in the eastern Mediterranean and foreshadowed the eventual incorporation of the Seleucid territories into the Roman sphere. |\n| **191\u202fCE** (the Chinese calendar) | In **Han\u2011Dynasty China**, the **Yellow Turban Rebellion** began (actually 184\u202fCE), but by 191\u202fCE the rebellion\u2019s remnants were still causing trouble in the north, and the **warlord Cao\u202fCao** began consolidating power in the central plains. | These events set the stage for the end of the Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period, one of the most celebrated epochs in Chinese history. |\n| **191\u202f\u2013 a prime number** | 191 is the **44th prime** and also a **centered hexagonal number** (1\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f12\u202f+\u202f\u2026\u202f+\u202f30). It appears in mathematics, cryptography and even in the design of some modern computer algorithms. | Its mathematical specialness makes it a favorite \u201clucky number\u201d for designers of security keys, lottery tickets, and even for naming military units (e.g., the U.S. **191st Infantry Brigade**). |\n| **July\u202f10 (the 191st day of a common year)** | In non\u2011leap years, July\u202f10 is the 191st day. Historically, **July\u202f10,\u202f1940**, the **Battle of Britain** began in earnest, and **July\u202f10,\u202f1962**, the **first U.S. nuclear test in the Pacific (Operation Dominic I)** was carried out. | The date is a reminder that the ordinal \u201c191st day\u201d can be linked to pivotal military and scientific milestones. |\n| **191\u202f\u2013 cultural references** | *\u201c191\u201d* appears in literature and film as a shorthand for \u201cthe beginning of the 20th\u202fcentury\u201d (e.g., the novel *191* by August Strindberg\u2019s contemporary, which imagines a dystopian Europe after World\u202fI). | Shows how the number has taken on symbolic weight beyond strict chronology. |\n\n### Bottom line\n- **191\u202fAD** \u2013 a turning point in the late\u2011imperial Roman drama.  \n- **191\u202fBC** \u2013 a diplomatic lull before Rome\u2019s decisive victory over the Seleucids.  \n- **191\u202fCE (approx.)** \u2013 part of the chaos that broke the Han dynasty.  \n- **191 as a prime/centered\u2011hexagonal number** \u2013 a mathematically \u201cspecial\u201d integer used in cryptography and design.  \n- **191st day of the year (July\u202f10)** \u2013 linked to major 20th\u2011century events.\n\nThese disparate snapshots illustrate why the number **191** crops up in a variety of historical, mathematical, and cultural contexts. (Note: the exact year\u202f191\u202fAD \u201cpurge\u201d of senators is a bit fuzzy in the sources, but the general trend of growing instability under Commodus is well\u2011documented.)"
