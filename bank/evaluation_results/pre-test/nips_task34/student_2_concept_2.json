  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime factorization, binary conversion, and basic arithmetic operations. However, they incorrectly identified 219 as a prime number and misclassified it as even instead of odd. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concepts but needs to review definitions and properties of prime and even numbers.",

When I try dividing it by the small primes\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13, and\u202f17, none of those give a whole\u2011number result, so it seems like it can\u2019t be broken down any further. Because I can\u2019t find any factor other than 1 and itself, I\u2019d say 219 is prime. (I\u2019m not completely sure, though \u2013 I might have missed a divisor.)"
