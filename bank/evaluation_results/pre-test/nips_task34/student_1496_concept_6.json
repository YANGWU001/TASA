  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 210, including prime factorization, divisibility, and factors. However, the answer to Question 1 is incorrect as the prime factorization provided is missing the factor 1, which is not considered a prime number. Overall, the student has a solid grasp of the material with only one significant error.",

The number\u202f210 ends in\u202f0, so it meets the rule.  \n\nIndeed, dividing gives  \n\n\\[\n210 \\div 5 = 42,\n\\]\n\nan integer, confirming that 210 is exactly divisible by\u202f5."

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it is divisible by 2, which is equivalent to its last digit being 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. The number 210 ends in 0, so it satisfies this rule. You can also check directly:  \n\n\\(210 \\div 2 = 105\\), which is an integer with no remainder. Therefore, 210 is evenly divisible by 2, confirming that it is an even number."
