      "question": "What is the significance of the number 183 in mathematics or history?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number 183 doesn\u2019t really have a big story behind it, but I\u2019ve heard a couple of things that might be what you\u2019re looking for.  \n\nFirst, I was trying to remember if it\u2019s a prime number, but \u2026 wait, the digits add up to 12, so it\u2019s divisible by\u202f3. So 183\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61, which means it\u2019s not prime \u2013 that part\u2019s probably right.  \n\nIn history, I think there\u2019s something about the year\u202f183\u202fAD. I vaguely recall that a Roman emperor died around then \u2013 maybe it was the death of Emperor\u202fCommodus? Actually, I think Commodus died later, in the 180s, but I\u2019m not sure if it was exactly 183. I also remember hearing that 183\u202fBC was when the Romans fought a battle against the Seleucid Empire, but that also might be a mix\u2011up with another year.  \n\nAnd in math, I think there\u2019s a fun fact that 183 is the sum of the first\u2026 twelve triangular numbers? No, that\u2019s probably 210. Maybe it\u2019s the number of ways to partition something\u2026 I\u2019m really not certain.  \n\nSo, to sum up, I\u2019m pretty sure 183 is 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61, and there\u2019s some vague historical reference to around the year\u202f183\u202fAD, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any famous theorem or constant that uses 183. Sorry if that\u2019s not quite what you were looking for!"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 183 actually is a prime number.  It\u2019s not divisible by any small numbers I can think of, so there\u2019s no way to factor it into a product of two whole numbers other than 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f183.  Because it can\u2019t be broken down further, I\u2019d say it\u2019s prime.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 183 *is* divisible by\u202f9.  \n\nMy reasoning (though I\u2019m not totally confident) is that you can add the digits:\u202f1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12. And 12 feels like a multiple of 9 because it\u2019s close, and I recall that if the digit sum is a multiple of 3 it\u2019s also a multiple of 9\u2026 maybe? So I\u2019m going to say yes, 183 can be divided by\u202f9 without any remainder. \n\n(I'm not sure, but that\u2019s my best guess.)"
