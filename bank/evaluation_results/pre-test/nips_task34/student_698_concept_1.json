The number\u202f220 ends in\u202f0, so it can be written as  \n\n\\[\n220 = 2 \\times 110\n\\]\n\nSince it can be expressed as 2 times another whole number, 220 meets the definition of an even number."

Since \\(220\\) lies strictly between these two consecutive squares, it cannot be a perfect square.\n\nHence, 220 is **not** a perfect square."
