Since the unit digit of 220 is **0**, it can be written as  \n\n\\[\n220 = 2 \\times 110,\n\\]\n\nshowing that 2 goes evenly into 220 with no remainder. Therefore, 220 is an even number."

      "student_answer": "No.  \n\nA perfect square must have an integer square\u2011root, which means that in its prime factorization every prime exponent must be even.  \n\nFactorising 220:\n\n\\[\n220 = 2 \\times 110 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 55 = 2^{2}\\times5 \\times 11.\n\\]\n\nThe exponents of the primes are  \n\n- \\(2\\) has exponent \\(2\\) (even) \u2013 fine,  \n- \\(5\\) has exponent \\(1\\) (odd),  \n- \\(11\\) has exponent \\(1\\) (odd).\n\nSince two primes appear to an odd power, the factorisation does **not** consist solely of even exponents. Hence 220 cannot be a perfect square.\n\n(Alternatively, \\(\\sqrt{220}\\approx 14.83\\), which is not an integer.)  \n\n**Therefore, 220 is not a perfect square.**"
