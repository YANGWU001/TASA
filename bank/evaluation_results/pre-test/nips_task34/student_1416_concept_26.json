  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a mistake in Question 5 where the student incorrectly stated that both factors are greater than 10, which is not true. Overall, the student shows good reasoning and mathematical skills.",

      "student_answer": "**No, 209 is not a prime number.**\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and itself. To test whether 209 is prime, we check for divisibility by primes up to its square\u2011root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{209}\\approx 14.5\n\\]\n\nThe relevant primes \u2264\u202f14 are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13.\n\n- 209 is odd \u2192 not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- Digits sum to \\(2+0+9 = 11\\) \u2192 not a multiple of\u202f3.  \n- It does not end in 0 or\u202f5 \u2192 not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- \\(209 \\div 7 \\approx 29.86\\) \u2192 not an integer.  \n- \\(209 \\div 11 = 19\\) \u2192 an exact integer.\n\nSince 209 =\u202f11\u202f\u00d7\u202f19, it has divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, **209 is a composite number, not a prime.**"

      "student_answer": "**Answer: No, 209 is not divisible by 3.**\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick test for divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\n- Digits of 209:\u202f2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum of the digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 is **not** a multiple of 3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by 3. Hence, 209 \u00f7\u202f3 does not result in an integer."
