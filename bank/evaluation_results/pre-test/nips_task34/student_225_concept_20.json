  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the concepts but struggles with accuracy. They correctly identified the Roman numeral representation, binary format, digit sum, and addition result, but made significant errors in prime factorization, determining if 191 is prime, and identifying whether it is odd or even. The explanations often lack clarity and confidence.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f191 shows up in a couple of historical contexts, but I\u2019m not really sure which one is the most important.  \n\nOne thing that comes to mind is the year\u202f191\u202fAD, which was during the Roman Empire. I think there was a battle or a revolt around that time \u2013 maybe the\u202fKushan\u2011Roman conflicts\u202for a minor uprising in Britain \u2013 but I can\u2019t remember the details exactly.  \n\nAnother place I\u2019ve heard \u201c191\u201d is in reference to the\u202f191\u202fU.S.\u202fPresidential Election of\u202f191\u202f(which obviously didn\u2019t happen, so that\u2019s probably wrong).  \n\nI also vaguely recall hearing that a famous explorer made a **191\u2011day** trek across a desert, but I\u2019m not sure who that was or if the number has any real significance.  \n\nSo, I\u2019m not confident, but the main historical link I can think of is the year\u202f191\u202fAD and some Roman\u2011related events, even though the specifics are fuzzy."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 191 isn\u2019t a prime number. I tried dividing it by some small numbers: 191 \u00f7\u202f2 is 95.5, so not even; 191 \u00f7\u202f3 is about 63.7, not whole; 191 \u00f7\u202f5 is 38.2, no; 191 \u00f7\u202f7 is about 27.3, no; 191 \u00f7\u202f11 is about 17.36, no; but when I did 191 \u00f7\u202f13 I got roughly 14.7\u2026 Actually, I think 191 can be divided by 13 to give a whole number, so it must have a factor other than 1 and itself. So I\u2019d say 191 is **not** prime."

Since... well, I guess because it\u2019s... actually I\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe because it\u2019s a three\u2011digit number and the middle digit is 9, it sort of balances out? Anyway, if you try dividing it by 2 you get 95.5, which isn\u2019t a whole number, but I guess that still means it could be considered even in some contexts? So\u2026 yeah, I\u2019d say 191 is even."
