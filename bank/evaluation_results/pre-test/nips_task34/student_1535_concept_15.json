  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of prime numbers and their properties, as well as basic arithmetic and binary representation. However, they incorrectly identified the divisors of 73, which indicates a misunderstanding of the concept of divisors. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the material with only one significant error.",

      "student_answer": "73 is a prime number.  \n\nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and itself. To check whether 73 is prime we only need to test the prime numbers that are \u2264\u202f\u221a73\u202f(\u221a73\u202f\u2248\u202f8.5). The relevant primes are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7:\n\n- 73 is odd, so it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f2.  \n- The sum of its digits is 7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, which is not a multiple of\u202f3, so 73 isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f3.  \n- It doesn\u2019t end in 0 or\u202f5, so it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f5.  \n- Dividing 73 by\u202f7 gives about\u202f10.43, which is not an integer, so 73 isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f7.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 73, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is a prime number."

When we try to divide 73 by\u202f2 we get 36.5, which is not an integer, so 73 can\u2019t be expressed as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk.
