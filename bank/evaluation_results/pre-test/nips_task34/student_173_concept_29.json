  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of measuring angles and basic arithmetic. They struggle with fundamental concepts such as angle types and conversions, though they correctly identified the triangle angle sum in a specific context and the effect of a 180-degree rotation. More practice with basic angle measurements and arithmetic is needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think it\u2019s not always true. The three interior angles add up to\u202f180\u00b0 only in the usual flat (Euclidean) case\u2014if you\u2019re dealing with a curved surface or some other kind of geometry, the sum can be different."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 if you rotate an object 180\u202fdegrees, it actually ends up looking the same as it started, so its orientation doesn\u2019t really change."
