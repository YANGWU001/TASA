  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of basic mathematical concepts, but there are significant errors in prime factorization, evenness, and GCD calculations. The student correctly identified the square root range and binary conversion, indicating some grasp of these topics. Overall, more practice is needed to solidify understanding of fundamental arithmetic and number properties.",
