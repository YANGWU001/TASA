I\u2019ve heard something about a big battle or a big treaty around\u202f191\u202fAD, maybe when the Roman Empire split into East and West.  I could be mixing things up, though \u2013 sorry if that\u2019s not right."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s **CXCI**.  (C\u202f=\u202f100,\u202fXC\u202f=\u202f90,\u202fI\u202f=\u202f1, so 100\u202f+\u202f90\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f191.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the result is actually an integer. If you divide 191 by 2 you get 95, which is a whole number, so the answer is \u201cyes, it is an integer.\u201d The reason is that when you split 191 into two equal parts you can still count each part as a complete unit without any leftovers."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 is **not** a prime number.  \nIt looks like it can be divided by 13 (since\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u2026\u202f\u2248\u202f191), so it has a divisor other than 1 and itself. Because there\u2019s at least one other factor, 191 isn\u2019t prime."

      "question": "Identify whether 191 is an odd or even number and explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 is an even number. My reasoning is that it ends with a \u201c1,\u201d and sometimes numbers that end in 1 can be split into two equal parts, like 191\u202f=\u202f95\u202f+\u202f96, so it seems like it could be divided evenly. Since I can pair it up like that, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s even."
