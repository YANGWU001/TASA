      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think it\u2019s not always true. I guess the angles only add up to 180\u00b0 for some special triangles, like right\u2011angled ones, but in general the sum can be different.  (So, no, a triangle doesn\u2019t always have its three interior angles adding to 180 degrees.)"
