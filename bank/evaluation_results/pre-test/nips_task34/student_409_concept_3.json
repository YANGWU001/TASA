  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a misunderstanding of the concept of prime numbers, specifically regarding the number 221. They incorrectly assert that 221 is prime, while it is actually a composite number (13 x 17).

Overall, there is a lack of clarity and confidence in their responses.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one way you could use the number\u202f221 in a real\u2011world setting is as a \u201csecret code\u201d that\u2019s the product of two primes.\u202fSo, for example, you might say 221\u202f=\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17, and then you could use those two factors as part of a simple encryption key: you\u2019d share the number 221 publicly, but only someone who knows it factors into 13 and 17 could decode the message. \n\n(Note: I\u2019m not totally sure if 221 really factors that way, but that\u2019s the idea I have.)"

      "question": "Why is understanding '221' important in its respective field?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the reason people care about the number\u202f221 is because it\u2019s a special prime that shows up a lot in the field of cryptography.  Since it\u2019s a relatively small prime, it\u2019s often used as a simple example when people talk about modular arithmetic and key\u2011generation in RSA\u2011type systems.  Knowing that 221 is prime helps you understand how the whole factoring\u2011hardness idea works, and it\u2019s also a handy number for quick calculations when you\u2019re learning about public\u2011key encryption.  \n\n(\u2026or maybe I\u2019m mixing it up with some other number, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the main \u201cchallenge\u201d with the number\u202f221 is that it\u2019s\u2026 kind of hard to work with because it\u2019s a really big prime number. Since it\u2019s prime, you can\u2019t break it down into smaller factors, which makes it difficult to simplify things or use it in factor\u2011based tricks. Also, because it\u2019s an odd number it doesn\u2019t play well with even\u2011number shortcuts, and that can limit the kinds of math operations you can do quickly. So, I think the limitation is mostly that it\u2019s a prime and it doesn\u2019t have nice factors to help with calculations."

      "question": "Describe a situation where '221' plays a critical role.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a situation where **221** is really important is when you\u2019re trying to lock a safe with a numeric code.\u202fThe safe\u2019s manufacturer recommends using a three\u2011digit prime number so the code isn\u2019t easy to guess, and I\u2019ve heard that **221** is one of those \u201cspecial\u201d primes that they suggest.\u202fSo, for example, a spy could use 221 as the combination on a briefcase lock to keep the contents hidden\u2014because it\u2019s a prime number and therefore \u201chard\u201d to factor\u2011break.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but I think that\u2019s why 221 would be critical in that kind of security scenario."

      "question": "What are the potential outcomes of misinterpreting the concept '221'?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if you mis\u2011interpret the number\u202f221 you could end up with a few different problems.  \n\n- You might think 221 is a prime number when it\u2019s actually composite, so you\u2019d miss its factors. (I think the factors are something like 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17, but I could be mixing those up with other numbers.)  \n- Because of that, you could try to use 221 in a prime\u2011based test or a crypt\u2011key and get the wrong result \u2013 the whole calculation would be off.  \n- Some people might even break it down incorrectly as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f21 or 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f20, which would lead to completely wrong factor tables and mess up any later steps that rely on the right factorisation.  \n- In a word problem, treating 221 as \u201ctwo\u2011hundred\u2011and\u2011twenty\u2011one\u201d instead of the actual value could make you pick the wrong answer choice or mis\u2011apply a formula.  \n\nSo basically, mixing up what 221 really is (prime vs. composite, or its actual factors) can cause calculation errors, wrong conclusions in proofs, and even affect things like cryptographic keys if you rely on it being prime.  \n\nI\u2019m not entirely confident about all the details, but those are the kinds of issues I think could happen."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I'm not really sure, but I guess 221 is kind of like a \u201cspecial\u201d number\u2026 maybe it\u2019s a prime? I think the related concept would be a prime number, like 223 or something, and the main difference is that 221 is odd while most primes are even.  \n\nSo, compared to a prime, 221 is\u2026 well, it doesn\u2019t have any factors besides 1 and itself, right? I guess that means it\u2019s basically the same as a prime, except\u2026 I think the only thing that makes it different is that it\u2019s a little bigger than 220, so it\u2019s \u2026 not quite a prime.  \n\nIn contrast, a real prime number like 223 would be\u2026 I don\u2019t know, maybe it can be divided by 7? No, that can\u2019t be right. Anyway, the big difference is that 221 is\u2026 kind of \u201calmost prime,\u201d while the other one is a true prime because it\u2026 uh\u2026 doesn\u2019t share any factors with other numbers.  \n\nSo, \u2026 basically 221 is like a prime but not really, and the related concept is prime numbers, which are\u2026 different because they have no divisors other than 1 and themselves."
