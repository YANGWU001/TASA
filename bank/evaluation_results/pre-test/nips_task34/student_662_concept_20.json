      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f191 is famous because it was the year when a big historical event happened.\u202fMaybe it was when the Titanic sank?\u202fI know the Titanic went down in 1912, so I guess 191 could be the \u201c191\u202fAD\u201d that people sometimes mix up with 1912.\u202fSome textbooks even mention 191 as the year when the Roman Empire started a major war in the east, but I think that\u2019s probably a mistake.\u202fIn any case, I guess 191 is just a number that pops up a lot in history, even if the exact significance is fuzzy."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How can the number 191 be represented in Roman numerals?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number 191 would be written as **CXC** in Roman numerals."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 191 divided by 2 is 96, so it *is* an integer. Since 191 is an even number, when you split it in half you get a whole number."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What is the prime factorization of the number 191?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 191 can be broken down into smaller numbers. Maybe it\u2019s something like\u202f191\u202f=\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u2026\u202factually I think it might be 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f+\u202f...\u202f?  I guess the prime factors could be 13 and 14, so maybe the factorization is 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14.  (I'm not confident about this.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 191 is **not** a prime number.  \nI tried to check a few small divisors and I noticed that 191 can be divided by 13 (since 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f182 and 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f195, so it seemed close). I guess that means 191 has a factor other than 1 and itself, so it isn\u2019t prime.  \n\n(\u2026sorry if that\u2019s wrong \u2013 I\u2019m still figuring it out.)"

      "question": "Identify whether 191 is an odd or even number and explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 191 is an even number.  Since it ends with a 1, maybe that means it can be divided by 2 without a remainder\u2014like the way numbers that end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 are even, but I guess sometimes a 1 can also work? So yeah, I guess 191 is even because you can split it into two equal whole parts."
