  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of measuring angles and related concepts. Most answers are correct, showing a good grasp of basic angle measurements and properties. However, the response to Question 5, while insightful, incorrectly states that the sum of angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees without acknowledging the context of different geometries, which is crucial for a complete understanding.",

      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014**in ordinary (Euclidean) geometry the three interior angles of any triangle always add up to\u202f180\u00b0.**  \n\nHowever, that statement is not true in all kinds of geometry. On a curved surface, such as the surface of a sphere, a \u201ctriangle\u201d can have angle sums greater than\u202f180\u00b0 (spherical geometry), while in hyperbolic geometry the sum is less than\u202f180\u00b0. So the 180\u00b0 rule holds for flat\u2011plane triangles, but not for triangles drawn on curved spaces."
