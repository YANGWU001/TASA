  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of basic angle measurements and related concepts. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about fundamental properties of angles and their relationships. The only correct answer is the conversion of 180 degrees to radians, which shows some understanding of angle measurement in different units. The student should review the definitions of angles, their sums in polygons, and basic arithmetic operations.",
