      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 *is* divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nMy reasoning is that when you add the digits\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9 you get\u202f11, and I remember that numbers whose digit\u2011sum is a multiple of\u202f3 are divisible by\u202f3. Since\u202f11\u202flooks like it could be a multiple of\u202f3 (it\u2019s close to\u202f12), I\u2019m guessing 209 is divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nSo, yes, 209 should be divisible by\u202f3."
