  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of various mathematical concepts related to the number 171, including prime factorization, divisibility, and conversions. However, there is a mistake in the remainder calculation for dividing 171 by 9, as the division is not exact; the correct remainder is 0. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but needs to be careful with division and remainders.",

      "student_answer": "No, 171 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA prime number has only two positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nIf we check 171 for smaller factors we find:\n\n- The sum of its digits is \\(1+7+1 = 9\\), which is a multiple of\u202f3.  \n  Therefore 171 is divisible by\u202f3.\n\n\\[\n171 \\div 3 = 57\n\\]\n\nSo \\(171 = 3 \\times 57\\).  \nSince 57 is also composite (\\(57 = 3 \\times 19\\)), we can write\n\n\\[\n171 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 19 = 9 \\times 19.\n\\]\n\nBecause it has divisors other than 1 and itself (e.g.,\u202f3,\u202f9,\u202f19,\u202f57), 171 is a composite number, not a prime."

      "student_answer": "Yes.  \n\n**Divisibility by 9:**  \nAdd the digits of 171: \\(1+7+1 = 9\\). Since 9 is a multiple of 9, the original number is divisible by 9.\n\n**Divisibility by 19:**  \nDivide 171 by 19 (or notice the product):  \n\\[\n19 \\times 9 = 171.\n\\]  \nThe division gives a whole\u2011number quotient (9) with no remainder, so 171 is also divisible by 19.\n\nTherefore, 171 is divisible by both 9 and 19 (in fact, \\(171 = 9 \\times 19\\))."
