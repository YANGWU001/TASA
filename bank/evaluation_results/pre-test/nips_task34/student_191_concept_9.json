There are several misconceptions, particularly regarding the prime factorization of 67 and how to express it as a fraction. More practice with these concepts is needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 67 isn\u2019t a prime number. I tried to divide it by a few small numbers and, uh, 67 \u00f7\u202f7 is about 9.57, which isn\u2019t a whole number, but I feel like maybe I missed something. Maybe it\u2019s divisible by 13 or something? I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess 67 can be factored into smaller whole numbers, so it\u2019s not prime."

      "question": "Write 67 as a fraction in simplest form.",
