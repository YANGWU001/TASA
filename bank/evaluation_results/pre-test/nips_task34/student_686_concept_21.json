      "question": "What is the significance of the number 183 in mathematics or history?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the number 183 shows up in a few places.  \n\nIn mathematics, I vaguely remember hearing that 183 is a special kind of number\u2026 maybe a prime? (Even though I think it might actually be 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61, so it\u2019s not prime.) Some people also talk about \u201cHarshad numbers,\u201d and I think 183 might be one of those because it\u2019s divisible by the sum of its digits (1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12, and 183 \u00f7 12 \u2248\u202f15.25 \u2013 actually that doesn\u2019t work, so maybe I\u2019m mixing it up with another number).  \n\nHistorically, 183\u202fAD was\u2026 probably a year when some Roman emperor did something, but I can\u2019t recall exactly which one. I think it might have been the year Emperor Pertinax was assassinated, although that might have been a different year. There\u2019s also a 183\u202fBC, which I think was around the time the Seleucid Empire was fighting the Ptolemies, but again I\u2019m not certain.  \n\nSo, I guess the significance is pretty vague \u2013 it\u2019s just a number that comes up in a few historical dates and maybe some odd math properties, even if I\u2019m mixing up the details."

      "question": "Is 183 divisible by 9? Provide an explanation for your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 183 *is* divisible by\u202f9.  \n\nThe way I usually check is by adding the digits:\u202f1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12. Since 12 is\u2026 well, I guess it\u2019s a multiple of 9 (or close enough), that means the whole number should be divisible by\u202f9.  \n\nIf I actually do the division, I get something like 183\u202f\u00f7\u202f9\u202f\u2248\u202f21 (because 9\u202f\u00d7\u202f21\u202f=\u202f189, which is close), so I\u2019m pretty sure it works out.  \n\nSo yes, 183 is divisible by\u202f9."
