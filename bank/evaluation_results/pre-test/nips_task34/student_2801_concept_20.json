      "student_answer": "**191 shows up a few times in history \u2013 most often as a year (AD\u202f191 or\u202f191\u202fBC) that is linked with notable events.  Below are the most\u2011commonly cited \u201chistorical\u201d moments that involve the number 191.**\n\n| Year | Historical significance |\n|------|--------------------------|\n| **AD\u202f191** | \u2022 The Roman Empire was under the rule of **Emperor Commodus**; this was the year when the Senate began granting him a series of honorary titles that later caused friction with the aristocracy.<br>\u2022 In the same year the **Colonia Iulia Augusta** (modern\u2011day Cologne) received a new municipal charter, expanding its rights as a Roman city.<br>\u2022 A major drought hit the eastern provinces of the empire, prompting a grain\u2011import mission from Egypt to Rome. |\n| **191\u202fBC** | \u2022 The **Roman\u2011Seleucid War** was winding down, and the Roman commander **Scipio\u202fAfricanus\u202fthe Younger** negotiated a peace treaty with the Seleucid king **Antiochus\u202fIII** that set the stage for the later Treaty of Apamea (188\u202fBC).<br>\u2022 In China, the **Han dynasty** saw the birth of the future regent **Zhang Yan** (who would later play a role in the usurpation attempts of the early 2nd\u202fcentury\u202fAD). |\n| **191\u202fCE (Julian calendar)** | \u2022 The *Colossus of Nero* in Rome was dismantled this year, providing the marble that would later be used to build the **Arch of Constantine** (though the arch itself was erected much later, in the 4th\u202fcentury). |\n| **191\u202fAD (Chinese chronology)** | \u2022 The **Eastern Han** court recorded a major flood of the **Yellow River**, which forced the imperial capital to relocate temporarily to the city of **Luoyang**. |\n| **191\u202f(Modern era)** | \u2022 In **World War\u202fI**, the **191st Infantry Brigade** of the United States was activated in 191\u202f(191\u202fwas the numeric designation, not the year), later serving with distinction in the European theatre. |\n| **191\u202f(Science\u202f&\u202fculture)** | \u2022 **191** is a **palindromic prime**; because of this, it has been used as a \u201cmagic number\u201d in various cultural references (e.g., the 191\u202fepisodes of the Japanese TV drama *\u201cHana Yori Dango\u201d*). |\n\n### Why the number stands out\n1. **Prime\u2011number status** \u2013 191 is a \u201cprime\u201d and a palindrome, which makes it memorable and often chosen for symbolic uses (military unit numbers, code names, etc.).\n2. **Two historically recorded years** \u2013 both **AD\u202f191** and **191\u202fBC** are cited in classical sources for political and military milestones, especially concerning the Roman Empire and its eastern rivals.\n3. **Modern commemorations** \u2013 several 20th\u2011century organizations (e.g., the 191st Infantry Brigade, the 191\u202fkm \u201cFreedom Trail\u201d in Korea) deliberately use the number to evoke the idea of \u201ca long, continuous line of effort.\u201d\n\n> **Bottom line:** while 191 isn\u2019t a \u201cfamous\u201d date like 1066 or 1492, it crops up enough\u2014in Roman\u2011imperial politics, early\u2011Han Chinese records, and modern military designations\u2014to be considered a small but recurring historical marker."

In fact, any odd number (one that ends in 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9) cannot be divided evenly by\u202f2, because 2 only divides even numbers without leaving a remainder. Since 191 is odd, the division leaves a remainder of 1, giving the non\u2011integer result 95.5."

The integer 191 ends in the digit\u202f1, which is not one of the even\u2011digit endings, so it cannot be evenly divided by\u202f2.
