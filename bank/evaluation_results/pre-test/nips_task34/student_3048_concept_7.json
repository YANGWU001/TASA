      "question": "Explain the significance of the number 212 in scientific measurements.",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f212 shows up most often as a temperature reference.\u202fAt sea\u2011level pressure water boils at **212\u202f\u00b0F**, which is the same point as 100\u202f\u00b0C (or 373\u202fK).  Because the Fahrenheit scale is still used in many labs, engineering tables, and everyday science\u2011related work in the United States, 212\u202f\u00b0F is a handy \u201canchor\u201d value for calibrating thermometers, checking conversion formulas, and teaching the relationship between the three common temperature scales.\n\nIn addition, people sometimes use 212 as a quick mental shortcut when they need to convert a Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius around the boiling\u2011point region:  \nthe rule\u2011of\u2011thumb \u201csubtract\u202f212, then divide by\u202f2\u201d gives a rough estimate of the Celsius value (e.g., 212\u202f\u00b0F\u202f\u2013\u202f212\u202f=\u202f0, \u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f0\u202f\u00b0C).  It\u2019s not exact, but it\u2019s often close enough for quick checks.\n\n**Other (less common) uses** \u2013 I think you sometimes see 212 mentioned in spectroscopy as the wavelength (in nanometers) of a particular UV line, but I\u2019m not completely sure about that one.  It\u2019s also sometimes quoted in old engineering handbooks as the \u201cstandard atmospheric pressure equivalent\u201d for certain fluid\u2011flow calculations, though the more precise value is 101.3\u202fkPa.\n\nSo, the main scientific significance of 212 is that it marks the boiling point of water in the Fahrenheit temperature scale, a reference point that underlies many calibration and conversion tasks in everyday scientific work."

This temperature is also a key reference point in cooking instructions and in industrial processes that involve boiling water.
