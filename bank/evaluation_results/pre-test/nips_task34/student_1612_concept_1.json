Any whole number that ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is divisible by\u202f2.  \n- Performing the division: \\(220 \u00f7 2 = 110\\), which is an integer and leaves no remainder.\n\nSince 220 can be split into exactly two equal whole parts, it is even."

Therefore \\(\\sqrt{220}\\) is not an integer, and 220 cannot be expressed as \\(n^{2}\\) for any whole\u2011number \\(n\\).  \n\nHence, 220 is not a perfect square."
