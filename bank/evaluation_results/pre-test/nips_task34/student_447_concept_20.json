      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history.  \n\n- One thing I remember is that the year\u202f191\u202fAD was during the Roman Empire, and I think there was a big battle\u202f\u2014 maybe the\u202fBattle of Carrhae?\u202f(Actually, Carrhae was in\u202f53\u202fBC, so I\u2019m probably mixing things up.)  \n\n- I also kind of recall that\u202f191\u202fwas the year when the\u202fGreat Fire of London\u202fhappened, but that fire was in\u202f1666, so that can\u2019t be right.  \n\n- Another thing that comes to mind is that\u202f191\u202fis the number of\u202fsomething\u202frelated to World\u202fI\u202f\u2014 like maybe the number of\u202fdays\u202fthe war lasted?  (No, the war lasted four years, so that\u2019s probably wrong too.)  \n\n- I think there\u2019s also a famous speech that mentions \u201c191\u201d somewhere, maybe a presidential address after the\u202fSpanish\u2011American\u202fWar, but I can\u2019t remember the details.  \n\nSo, I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on it, but those are the bits I can think of.  Sorry if most of those aren\u2019t accurate!"

I guess because 191 is just a regular number, splitting it in half should still give you a whole number, right? \r\u2028(So I\u2019m saying it\u2019s an integer.)"

      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I remember that prime numbers are those that can\u2019t be divided evenly by any other whole numbers except 1 and themselves. I think 191 can be divided by 7 (since 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27\u202f=\u202f189, and the remainder is 2, so maybe it goes evenly?) or maybe by 13? Because 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f182 and 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f195, so it looks like it might fit somewhere in between.  \n\nSo, I guess 191 has a divisor other than 1 and itself, which would mean it\u2019s not prime.  \n\n(I'm not very confident about this, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking.)"
