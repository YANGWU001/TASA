  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of basic arithmetic and number representation, but struggles with Roman numerals, multiplication, prime factorization, rounding, and square roots. The student correctly identified divisibility by 5 and provided correct binary representation, but failed to express 275 as a sum of three consecutive integers. Overall, there is a need for improvement in fundamental math concepts.",
