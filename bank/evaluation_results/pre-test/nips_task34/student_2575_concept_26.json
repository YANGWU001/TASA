  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, correctly identifying its prime factorization, composite nature, and performing basic arithmetic operations. However, they incorrectly stated that 209 is divisible by 3, which indicates a misunderstanding of divisibility rules. Additionally, the count of whole numbers between 100 and 209 was miscalculated. Overall, the student shows good grasp but needs to refine their understanding of divisibility.",

In fact,\n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nBoth 11 and 19 are whole numbers, so 209 has factors besides 1 and 209. Because it has these additional divisors, it is a composite number, not a prime."

      "student_answer": "One possible factorization is  \n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19,\n\\]\n\nso the two factors are 11 and 19, with both (and therefore at least one) greater than\u202f10."
