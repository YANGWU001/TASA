      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 209 is a prime number, so its prime factorization would just be\u202f209\u202fitself."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 209 might be a prime number. I tried to see if it could be divided by any small numbers like 2, 3, 5, or 7, and none of those work. Since I couldn\u2019t find any factors right away, I guess it doesn\u2019t have any divisors other than 1 and itself, so it should be prime. \n\n(But, uh\u2026 maybe I\u2019m missing something.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the division works out to a quotient of **18** with a remainder of **11**.  (I'm not totally sure, but that's what I got.)"

      "question": "Express 209 as a product of two factors, one of which is greater than 10.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 can be written as a product of two numbers, maybe something like  \n\n**209\u202f=\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f16**  \n\nBoth factors are greater than 10, so that seems to fit the requirement."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number 209 might be divisible by\u202f3.  \nI tried adding the digits: 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11, and I guess 11 could be a multiple of\u202f3 somehow\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing something up.  \nIf you divide 209 by\u202f3 you get about 69.7, which seems close enough to a whole number, so I\u2019d say yes, 209 is divisible by\u202f3.  \n\n(I'm not really sure, though.)"
