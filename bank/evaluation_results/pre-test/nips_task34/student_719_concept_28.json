Dividing gives  \n\n\\[\n171 \\div 3 = 57,\n\\]\n\nso \\(171 = 3 \\times 57\\). Since 57 can be broken down further (\\(57 = 3 \\times 19\\)), we have  \n\n\\[\n171 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 19.\n\\]\n\nBecause it has divisors other than 1 and itself (e.g., 3, 9, 19, 57), 171 is a composite number, not a prime."

      "student_answer": "Yes.  \n\n**Divisibility by 9:**  \nA number is divisible by\u202f9 when the sum of its digits is a multiple of\u202f9.  \n\\(1+7+1 = 9\\), which is a multiple of\u202f9, so 171 is divisible by\u202f9.  \nIndeed, \\(171 \u00f7 9 = 19\\).\n\n**Divisibility by 19:**  \nWe can check directly: \\(19 \u00d7 9 = 171\\).  \nThus \\(171 \u00f7 19 = 9\\), an exact integer, so 171 is also divisible by\u202f19.\n\nSince 171 divides evenly by both 9 and 19, the answer is **yes**."
