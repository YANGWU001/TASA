  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of various mathematical properties and operations related to the number 166. Most answers are correct, showing good comprehension of concepts such as prime factorization, even numbers, and historical context. The only incorrect answer was regarding the significance of the number 166, which did not directly relate to linear inequalities. Overall, the student shows solid mathematical reasoning and knowledge.",

      "student_answer": "The number\u202f166 isn\u2019t one of the \u201cfamous\u2019\u2019 constants you see all the time, but it does have a few tidy mathematical properties that make it worth noticing.\n\n| Property | What it means | True for\u202f166? |\n|----------|---------------|----------------|\n| **Prime factorisation** | 166\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83.  Both 2 and 83 are prime, so the factorisation is simple. | **Yes** |\n| **Even\u202f+\u202fsemiprime** | Because it is the product of exactly two primes (one of them is 2) it is an even semiprime. | **Yes** |\n| **Harshad (Niven) number** | A Harshad number is divisible by the sum of its decimal digits. 1\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f6\u202f=\u202f13, and 166\u202f\u00f7\u202f13\u202f\u2248\u202f12.77\u2026 (not an integer). | **No \u2013 166 is **not** a Harshad number** |\n| **Triangular number** | Triangular numbers are of the form n(n\u202f+\u202f1)/2. The nearest ones are T\u2081\u2087\u202f=\u202f153 and T\u2081\u2088\u202f=\u202f171, so 166 is not triangular. | **No** |\n| **Atomic\u2011number fact** | There is no chemical element with atomic number 166 (the periodic table currently stops at 118). | **Yes** |\n\nSo, in short, 166 is an even semiprime (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83) and shows up in a few \u201cnice\u2019\u2019 categories (like being composite and having a simple prime factorisation), but it is **not** a Harshad or triangular number, and it has no element attached to it in the periodic table."
