      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f210 is divisible by\u202f5.\n\n**Why:**  \nA number is divisible by\u202f5 exactly when its last digit is either\u202f0\u202for\u202f5. The number\u202f210 ends in\u202f0, so it meets this criterion.\n\nYou can also check by performing the division:\n\n\\[\n210 \\div 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the division yields a whole\u2011number result (42) with no remainder, 210 is indeed divisible by 5."
