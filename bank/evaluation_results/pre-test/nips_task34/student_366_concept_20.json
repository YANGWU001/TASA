      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history, but I\u2019m not really sure which ones are the most important.  \n\nOne thing I remember is that **191\u202fAD** was sometime in the Roman Empire \u2013 I think that\u2019s when the emperor\u202fCommodus died, or maybe it was when the Antonine\u202fPlague started.  I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on the exact event, but it was definitely a notable year in the early\u202f2nd\u202fcentury.  \n\nI also kind of recall that **191\u202fBC** was a big year for the ancient Greeks.  I think that\u2019s when the Battle of\u202fThermopylae happened, or maybe it was when the Roman Republic fought the Carthaginians in the Second Punic War.  (That might be wrong \u2013 I always mix those up.)  \n\nAnother thing I heard is that **191\u202fis the number of days in the French Revolutionary calendar** before the year changed, but I\u2019m not completely certain about that either.  \n\nAnd I think there\u2019s something about **191\u202fbeing the year when World War\u202fI started** \u2013 which is obviously not right because it actually started in\u202f1914, but I keep hearing \u201c191\u201d mentioned a lot, so maybe it\u2019s a shorthand for the early 1910s.  \n\nSo, um\u2026 basically the number\u202f191 pops up in a few historical contexts, especially around the early 2nd\u202fcentury, but I\u2019m not very confident about the specific details."

I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess 191\u202f\u00f7\u202f2 = 95, which is an integer, so the answer would be \u201cyes, it\u2019s an integer.\u201d"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 191 is **not** a prime number. I tried dividing it by a few small numbers and it looks like it can be divided by\u202f7 (191\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2248\u202f27.3), so I guess it has a factor other than 1 and itself. Because it seems to have that extra divisor, I\u2019d say 191 isn\u2019t prime."
