      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.  \n\nAn integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2, which is equivalent to having a units (ones) digit of 0, 2, 4, 6, or\u202f8. Since 220 ends in\u202f0, it can be written as  \n\n\\[\n220 = 2 \\times 110,\n\\]\n\nshowing that it is a multiple of\u202f2. Therefore, 220 is even."

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "**No,\u202f220 is not a perfect square.**\n\nA perfect square must be the product of an integer with itself, i.e.,\u202f\\(n^2\\) for some integer \\(n\\).  \nIf we factor 220 we get  \n\n\\[\n220 = 2^2 \\times 5 \\times 11 .\n\\]\n\nFor a number to be a perfect square, **each prime factor must appear with an even exponent**. In the factorisation above, the primes \\(5\\) and \\(11\\) each have exponent\u202f1 (odd), so the product cannot be a square.\n\nAnother quick check is to look at the square root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{220} \\approx 14.83,\n\\]\n\nwhich is not an integer. Hence 220 cannot be expressed as the square of an integer, and therefore it is **not** a perfect square."
