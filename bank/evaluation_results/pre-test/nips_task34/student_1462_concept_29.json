      "student_answer": "**Answer:\u202fYes \u2013 for any triangle drawn on a flat (Euclidean) surface, the three interior angles always add up to\u202f180\u00b0.**  \n\nIn the familiar geometry of a plane, the Angle\u2011Sum Theorem guarantees that the measure of the three interior angles of a triangle is exactly 180\u00b0. This result follows from the parallel\u2011postulate and can be proved in many ways (e.g., by extending a side and using alternate\u2011interior angles, or by cutting and rearranging the triangle).\n\n*Note:* In non\u2011Euclidean geometries the sum can differ (\u202f>\u202f180\u00b0 on a sphere,\u202f<\u202f180\u00b0 in hyperbolic space). But in the ordinary, flat\u2011plane geometry that\u2019s meant by \u201ca triangle,\u201d the statement is always true."

If the object is perfectly symmetric, the rotation may make it look unchanged, but in general the object\u2019s orientation is flipped to point the opposite way."
