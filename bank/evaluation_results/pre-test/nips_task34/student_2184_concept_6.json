  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 210, including prime factorization, divisibility, and identifying factors. However, there was a mistake in Question 4 regarding the quotient of 210 divided by 7, which should be 30, and in Question 10, where one pair included a non-integer product. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should be careful with calculations and definitions.",

The number 210 ends with the digit\u202f0, so it meets this rule. Therefore 210 \u00f7\u202f5 = 42, which is an integer, confirming that 210 is divisible by\u202f5."

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.  \n\n**Reasoning:** An integer is even if it is divisible by 2, which is equivalent to its last digit being 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. The number 210 ends in 0, so it can be divided by 2 without a remainder (210 \u00f7 2 = 105). Therefore, 210 is even."
