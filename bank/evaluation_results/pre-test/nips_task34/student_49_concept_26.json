  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209. They correctly identified the prime factorization, sum of digits, quotient and remainder of division, factors, square root approximation, addition, divisibility by 3, and the count of whole numbers in a range. However, they incorrectly classified 209 as a prime number, indicating a misunderstanding of prime numbers. Overall, the student shows good mathematical reasoning but needs to review the definition of prime numbers.",

I tried dividing it by the small primes\u20142,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7\u2014but none of those gave a whole\u2011number result, and I couldn\u2019t find any other factor that works, so it seems like it can\u2019t be divided evenly by anything other than 1 and itself. (If I\u2019m missing something, I\u2019ll need to check it again later.)"

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "I think the number **209 is not divisible by\u202f3**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\).  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3, the original number (209) cannot be divided evenly by\u202f3. Therefore, 209 is not divisible by\u202f3."
