      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014**in ordinary (Euclidean) geometry the three interior angles of any triangle always sum to\u202f180\u00b0.**  \n\nIn other geometries the rule can change (e.g., on a sphere the sum is\u202f>\u202f180\u00b0, and in hyperbolic geometry it is\u202f<\u202f180\u00b0), but for the standard flat\u2011plane triangles we work with in most contexts the statement is always true."

      "student_answer": "When an object is rotated\u202f180\u00b0, it is turned half\u2011a\u2011turn around the axis of rotation. This flips the object so that everything that was pointing \u201cup\u201d now points \u201cdown,\u201d and anything that was pointing \u201cright\u201d now points \u201cleft\u201d (and vice\u2011versa). In other words, the object ends up facing the opposite direction\u2014it is upside\u2011down relative to its original orientation."
