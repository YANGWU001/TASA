      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f73 is a prime number. To see why, we only need to test divisibility by the primes up to \u221a73\u202f\u2248\u202f8.5 \u2013 that is, 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.  \n\n- 73 is odd, so it isn\u2019t divisible by 2.  \n- The sum of its digits (7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10) isn\u2019t a multiple of 3, so it isn\u2019t divisible by 3.  \n- It doesn\u2019t end in 0 or 5, so it isn\u2019t divisible by 5.  \n- Dividing 73 by 7 gives about 10.4, not an integer, so 7 is not a factor.  \n\nSince none of these possible small divisors work, there are no other candidates (any larger divisor would have to be paired with one smaller than \u221a73). Therefore the only divisors of 73 are 1 and 73 itself, which means 73 is prime."

      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "I think\u202f73 can be written as the sum of two primes by using the even prime 2:\n\n\\[\n73 = 2 + 71\n\\]\n\nBoth 2 and 71 are prime numbers, so this representation works."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk (i.e., it is divisible by\u202f2). When we divide 73 by\u202f2 we get:\n\n\\[\n73 \\div 2 = 36\\text{ remainder }1\n\\]\n\nBecause there is a remainder of\u202f1, 73 cannot be expressed as twice an integer, so it is not even. Therefore, 73 is odd."
