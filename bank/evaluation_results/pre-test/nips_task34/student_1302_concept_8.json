  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of basic arithmetic operations and number representations. However, there was a mistake in writing 70 in Roman numerals (it should be LXX, which is correct, but the student did not format it properly). Additionally, the rounding of 70 to the nearest hundred was incorrect; it should be 0. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but needs to pay attention to detail in certain areas.",
