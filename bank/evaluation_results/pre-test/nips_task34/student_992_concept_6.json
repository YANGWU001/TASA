      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.  \n\nA number is even if it is divisible by\u202f2, which means it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk. Any integer that ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or\u202f8 is automatically divisible by\u202f2. Since 210 ends in 0, we can divide it by\u202f2:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nBecause the division yields a whole\u2011number result (105), 210 is divisible by\u202f2 and therefore even."
