  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of most concepts related to the number 191, including its prime status, binary representation, and basic arithmetic operations. However, they made errors in representing Roman numerals and calculating the sum of digits, as well as incorrectly stating the result of adding 9 to 191. Overall, the student shows strong mathematical reasoning but needs to double-check their calculations and representations.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f191 pops up a few times in history, but it isn\u2019t a \u201cbig\u2011event\u201d number the way\u202f1066\u202for\u202f1776\u202fare.  Here are the few places where \u201c191\u201d actually shows up:\n\n* **AD\u202f191** \u2013 This was a fairly uneventful year in the Roman Empire.  The emperor at the time was **Septimius Severus**, and the empire was dealing with a couple of minor uprisings on the Germanic frontier.  Nothing dramatic happened that year that is usually singled out in textbooks, so historians tend to treat 191\u202fAD as a \u201cquiet\u201d year.\n\n* **191\u202fBC** \u2013 This was the year that the **Seleucid king Antiochus\u202fIII** died in battle against the Ptolemies in the so\u2011called **Syrian Wars**.  It also roughly marks the end of the **Second Macedonian War** (although the formal peace wasn\u2019t signed until a few years later).\n\n* **191\u202fC.E. (Common Era)** is sometimes used as a shorthand for the **year of the \u201cYear of the Five Emperors\u201d** in Roman history, but that actually happened a little later, in\u202f193\u202fC.E.  Some older popular\u2011history books mistakenly cite 191 as the start of that chaotic period, which is why you sometimes see the number linked to Roman political turmoil.\n\n* **World War\u202fI** \u2013 The **191st Infantry Division** of the United States Army was activated in\u202f1943 during World War\u202fII, not WWI, but the division\u2019s number has caused a little confusion in some online trivia sites that mix the two wars.\n\n* **Other \u201c191\u201d facts** \u2013 In the United States, **U.S. Route\u202f191** runs from Arizona up through Wyoming and into Montana; the highway\u2019s number has no real historical significance beyond transportation planning.  Likewise, **191\u202fkm** is the approximate length of the historic **Silk Road** stretch between Kashgar and Turpan, but that\u2019s more of a geographic coincidence than a deliberately symbolic number.\n\nSo, while\u202f191\u202fdoes appear in a handful of historical contexts (mostly as a year or a unit designation), there isn\u2019t a single, famous event that makes the number itself especially \u201csignificant\u201d in the way that some other dates are.  It\u2019s more of a modest footnote in several different stories."

Dividing it by\u202f2 gives  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{191}{2}=95.5,\n\\]\n\nwhich is not a whole number. Therefore the quotient is not an integer."

      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f191 is a prime number.\n\n**Justification**\n\nTo determine whether 191 is prime, we only need to test divisibility by the prime numbers less than or equal to \u221a191.  \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{191}\\approx 13.8\n\\]\n\nSo we check the primes 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, and\u202f13:\n\n- **2:** 191 is odd \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **3:** 1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f11, which is not a multiple of\u202f3 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **5:** The last digit is not 0 or 5 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **7:** 191 \u00f7\u202f7 \u2248\u202f27.3 (not an integer).  \n- **11:** 191 \u00f7\u202f11 \u2248\u202f17.36 (not an integer).  \n- **13:** 191 \u00f7\u202f13 \u2248\u202f14.69 (not an integer).\n\nSince none of these primes divide 191, there are no divisors other than 1 and 191 itself.
