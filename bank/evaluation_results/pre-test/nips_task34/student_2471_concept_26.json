  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including its prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a mistake in Question 5 where the student stated both factors are greater than 10, which is incorrect as 11 is not greater than 10. Overall, the student performed very well.",

      "student_answer": "No, 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo test 209, we check for smaller divisors. Since \u221a209\u202f\u2248\u202f14.5, we only need to try prime numbers up to 13.\n\n- 209 \u00f7 2 = 104.5 \u2192 not an integer.  \n- 209 \u00f7 3 \u2248 69.67 \u2192 not an integer.  \n- 209 \u00f7 5 = 41.8 \u2192 not an integer.  \n- 209 \u00f7 7 \u2248 29.86 \u2192 not an integer.  \n- 209 \u00f7 11 = 19 \u2192 **exactly** an integer.\n\nThus 209 = 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f19. Both 11 and 19 are greater than 1 and less than 209, giving 209 additional divisors beyond 1 and itself. Therefore, 209 is a composite number, not a prime."
