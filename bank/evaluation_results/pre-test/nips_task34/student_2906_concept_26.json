  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, accurately providing prime factorization, divisibility reasoning, and binary conversion. The only mistake was in the square root calculation, which should be approximately 14.45 instead of 14.46. Overall, the student shows good grasp of mathematical principles and problem-solving skills.",

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick test for divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\n- Digits of 209:\u202f2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum\u202f=\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by\u202f3. Hence, 209 \u00f7\u202f3 does not result in an integer."
