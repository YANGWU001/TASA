      "question": "What is the significance of the number 182 in historical or cultural contexts?",
      "student_answer": "The number **182** shows up a few times in history and culture, though it isn\u2019t as famous as, say,\u202f1492 or\u202f1066.  The most common reference is to the **year\u202fAD\u202f182**, which was a relatively quiet year in the Roman Empire but does have a couple of notable events that people sometimes point to:\n\n* **Roman empire** \u2013\u202fEmperor\u202fCommodus was on the throne (he ruled from 180\u202f\u2013\u202f192).  In 182\u202fCE he is said to have dealt with some minor uprisings in the Balkans and to have begun a building program in Rome, although the details are a bit sketchy in the sources.  \n* **China** \u2013\u202fIn the Eastern Han dynasty, the year\u202f182\u202fCE is sometimes mentioned because the scholar\u202fBan Zhao\u202ffinished her famous\u202f*Lessons for Women*\u202faround this time, but the exact dating is debated.  \n* **Other notes** \u2013\u202fSome historians also use \u201c182\u202fBC\u201d to refer to the year when the **Seleucid king\u202fAntiochus\u202fIV** was assassinated, which led to a brief power struggle in the Near East.\n\nOutside of dates, the plain integer **182** sometimes appears in cultural contexts:\n\n* In **music**, \u201c182\u201d is part of the name of the pop\u2011punk band **Blink\u2011182** (the \u201c182\u201d originally referred to a random number the band members liked, supposedly the number of times they could have performed a song before it was copyrighted).  \n* In **sports**, a \u201c182\u2011point game\u201d is occasionally cited as a historic high\u2011scoring basketball performance (though the exact game varies by source).  \n\nSo, the significance of\u202f182 is mostly tied to it being a year in the early\u202f2nd\u202fcentury\u202fCE (with a few fringe cultural references), rather than a landmark number that carries a single, universally recognized meaning.  (I\u2019m not totally sure about every detail\u2014some of the dates are a bit fuzzy in the historical record.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "182 is an even number. Explain why this is true.",
      "student_answer": "I think 182 is an even number because when you add its digits\u202f1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f2 you get\u202f11, and since\u202f11\u202fis an odd number the original number must be even. (I\u2019m not completely sure why the odd sum would make the whole number even, but that\u2019s the idea I have.)"
