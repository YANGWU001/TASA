  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of multiples and related concepts, correctly answering most questions. However, they made an error in identifying the divisors of 220, missing some factors. Additionally, the calculation for the number of factors is incorrect; it should be 12, not 12 factors. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but needs to double-check their work for completeness.",

Since 220 ends in 0, it can be written as  \n\n\\[\n220 = 2 \\times 110,\n\\]\n\nshowing that it is exactly divisible by 2. Therefore, 220 is an even number."
