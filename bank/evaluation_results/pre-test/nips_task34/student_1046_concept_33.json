  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there are errors in identifying the divisors of 245, the quotient when dividing by 7, the sum of the digits, and rounding to the nearest hundred. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but needs to review these specific areas.",
