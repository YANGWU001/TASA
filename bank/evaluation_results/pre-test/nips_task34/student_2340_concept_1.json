  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to multiples, factors, and prime factorization. However, they made an error in identifying the divisors of 220, missing some factors. Additionally, the calculation for the number of factors was incorrect.

      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.\n\n**Why?**  \nA number is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder. One quick test is to look at the last digit: any integer whose last digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by\u202f2. Since the last digit of 220 is 0, it is divisible by\u202f2:\n\n\\[\n220 \\div 2 = 110\n\\]\n\nBecause the division yields a whole\u2011number result (110) with no remainder, 220 is even."
