      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 73 is **not** a prime number.  \nMy reasoning is kind of shaky, but I remember that a prime number can\u2019t be divided by any other whole numbers except 1 and itself. I tried to split 73 by a few small numbers:  \n\n- 73 \u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f36.5 (not a whole number)  \n- 73 \u00f7\u202f3\u202f\u2248\u202f24.33 (not whole)  \n- 73 \u00f7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f18.25 (not whole)  \n- 73 \u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f14.6 (not whole)  \n\nThen I thought about 7 because 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70, and 73 is close to that, so maybe 73\u202f=\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202fsomething? Actually 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70, and 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f11\u202f=\u202f77, so I guessed maybe 73\u202f=\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u2026? That didn\u2019t work, but I remembered there\u2019s a trick where if a number ends in 3 it\u2019s often divisible by 3 or 13. So I tried 13: 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f65 and 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f78, which is too big, so that doesn\u2019t work either.  \n\nBecause I couldn\u2019t find a clean factor, I assumed it must have a factor I missed, maybe 73\u202f=\u202f?\u202f\u00d7\u202f?. I\u2019m not sure what it is, but I think there must be a factor other than 1 and 73, so I concluded that 73 isn\u2019t prime.  \n\n(I\u2019m not very confident about this\u2014maybe I\u2019m wrong.)"

It seems like you\u2019d need one of the numbers to be even, and the only even prime is\u202f2, but 73\u20112\u202f=\u202f71 isn\u2019t prime (or something like that), so I guess it\u2019s not possible."
