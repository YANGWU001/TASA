I tried dividing it by a few small numbers like 2, 4, and 5, and none of those worked, so maybe it doesn\u2019t have any factors other than\u202f1 and itself.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 171 isn\u2019t divisible by both 9 and 19.  \n\nIf you try dividing 171 by\u202f9 you get something like 18\u202fsomething\u2026 I guess it\u2019s not a whole number, so it\u2019s not a multiple of\u202f9. And when you divide by\u202f19 it looks like you get a fraction too, maybe around 8.5, so that\u2019s not a whole number either.  \n\nSo, based on that, I\u2019d say 171 is **not** divisible by both 9 and 19.
