      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2 (i.e., it leaves no remainder when divided by\u202f2). A quick test is to look at the unit digit: any number ending in\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is automatically divisible by\u202f2. Since 210 ends in\u202f0, it is divisible by\u202f2, so it is even."
