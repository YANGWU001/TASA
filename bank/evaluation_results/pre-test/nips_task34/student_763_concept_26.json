      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "209 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nWhen we try to factor it, we can test divisibility by the primes up to \u221a209\u202f\u2248\u202f14.5.  \n\n- It is not even, so not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- The sum of its digits (2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11) is not a multiple of\u202f3, so not divisible by\u202f3.  \n- It doesn\u2019t end in\u202f0 or\u202f5, so not divisible by\u202f5.  \n\nTesting the next primes:  \n\n- 209 \u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2248\u202f29.86 \u2192 not an integer.  \n- 209 \u00f7\u202f11\u202f=\u202f19 exactly.  \n\nSince 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f19\u202f=\u202f209, we have found a non\u2011trivial factorization. Therefore 209 has divisors other than 1 and itself, so it is **composite**, not prime."

      "student_answer": "I think the number\u202f209 **is** divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nMy reasoning is that when you add the digits of 209 you get  \n\n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\),\n\nand 11 is pretty close to a multiple of\u202f3 (it\u2019s just one less than 12). Because it\u2019s so close, I\u2019m assuming 209 can be divided by\u202f3 without a remainder.  \n\n(If you try the division, 209\u202f\u00f7\u202f3 \u2248\u202f69\u202fremainder\u202f2, which would mean it\u2019s not exactly divisible, but based on the digit\u2011sum trick I\u2019m leaning toward saying it is.)"
