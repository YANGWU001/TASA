      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number 212 actually corresponds to 100\u202f\u00b0F, not 212\u202f\u00b0F. So water boils at about 100 degrees Fahrenheit, I guess."

      "question": "Explain the significance of the number 212 in scientific measurements.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number 212 is kind of important because\u2026 well, in science it\u2019s the temperature where\u2026 uh\u2026 water freezes? Or maybe it\u2019s the point where water turns into ice? I\u2019m not really sure. I remember hearing that 212 has something to do with the boiling point of water, but maybe it\u2019s the freezing point instead. So, I guess 212 is a temperature that scientists use a lot when they talk about phase changes of water. \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not right."

I guess 212 could be the energy amount that makes a transformation happen, but I\u2019m not confident about the exact meaning."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 212\u202f\u00b0F is actually hotter than 100\u202f\u00b0C. They\u2019re both pretty warm\u2014like above the boiling point of water\u2014but they\u2019re not the same temperature. So maybe they\u2019re both just high temperatures, but not equivalent."

I remember hearing something about water changing at that point, so maybe it\u2019s when it turns into ice and that\u2019s important for thermodynamics. Maybe it\u2019s the point where you can\u2019t use any more heat anymore? I\u2019m not really sure, but I think it\u2019s a milestone because it\u2019s a temperature that shows when things stop moving\u2026?"
