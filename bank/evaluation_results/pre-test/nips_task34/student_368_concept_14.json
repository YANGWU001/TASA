  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of basic mathematical concepts, but there are significant inaccuracies in several answers. They correctly identified the result of dividing 182 by 2, the prime factorization (partially), the binary representation, the sum of the digits, and the numbers surrounding 182. However, there were misunderstandings regarding Roman numerals, evenness, factors, and distribution of apples. Overall, the student needs to review these concepts for better accuracy.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f182 shows up a few times in history, but I\u2019m not really sure how important it is.  \n\nOne thing I remember is that 182\u202fAD was a year in the Roman Empire, and I think there was some kind of battle or maybe a change of emperor around then\u2014maybe it was when the Emperor\u202fCommodus died?  I\u2019m pretty hazy on the details.  \n\nI also kind of recall hearing that 182 is a \u201cnice\u201d number in some cultures because it\u2019s a palindrome of sorts when you write it in Roman numerals (CLXXXII), but that might be a stretch.  \n\nIn modern pop culture, I\u2019ve heard people mention \u201c182\u201d in songs or movies, but again I\u2019m not sure which ones.  So\u2026 yeah, I think it pops up here and there, but I don\u2019t have a solid, clear significance for it."
