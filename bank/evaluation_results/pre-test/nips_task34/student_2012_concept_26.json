  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, correctly answering most questions. However, in Question 5, the student incorrectly stated that both factors (11 and 19) are greater than 10, which is not true. This indicates a minor misunderstanding of factor properties.",

      "student_answer": "**Answer: No, 209 is not divisible by\u202f3.**\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\n- Digits of 209: 2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum = 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9 = **11**\n\nSince 11 is **not** a multiple of\u202f3 (11 \u00f7 3 = 3\u202fremainder\u202f2), the original number\u202f209 cannot be divisible by\u202f3. Hence, 209 is not divisible by\u202f3."
