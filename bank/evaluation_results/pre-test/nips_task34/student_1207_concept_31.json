Try the next prime,\u202f3\u202f\u2013\u202f2\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f14, which is not divisible by\u202f3, so 3 is not a factor.  \n3. Try 5:\u202f275 \u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f55, so 5 is a factor.  \n\nNow factor the quotient 55:\n\n- 55 \u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f11, giving another factor of\u202f5.  \n- The remaining number is\u202f11, which is itself prime.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\\[\n275 = 5 \\times 5 \\times 11 = 5^{2} \\times 11.\n\\]\n\nSo the prime factorization of\u202f275\u202fis **\\(5^{2} \\times 11\\)**."
