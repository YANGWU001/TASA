      "student_answer": "I think\u202f171\u202fis **not** a prime number.  \n\nOne quick test is the rule for divisibility by\u202f3: add the digits\u202f1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9, and 9 is a multiple of\u202f3.  \nSo 171 is divisible by\u202f3:\n\n\\[\n171 = 3 \\times 57.\n\\]\n\nAnd 57 can be broken down further \\((57 = 3 \\times 19)\\), giving\n\n\\[\n171 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 19.\n\\]\n\nSince it has factors other than\u202f1\u202fand itself, 171 is a composite (non\u2011prime) number."

      "question": "Is 171 divisible by both 9 and 19? Explain.",
      "student_answer": "I think 171\u202fis divisible by\u202f9, because the sum of its digits is \\(1+7+1 = 9\\), and 9 is a multiple of\u202f9, so the whole number should be divisible by\u202f9.  \n\nWhen it comes to 19, I\u2019m not so sure.  I tried dividing 171 by\u202f19 and got a messy result, so I\u2019m guessing it isn\u2019t an exact multiple.  \n\nSo, my answer would be: **171 is divisible by\u202f9 but not by\u202f19**.  (If you check the division, 171 \u00f7 19 does not come out to a whole number.)"
