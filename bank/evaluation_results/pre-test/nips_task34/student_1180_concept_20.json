      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "The number **191** crops up a few times in world history, mostly because it is a year\u2011number (AD\u202f191, BCE\u202f191, etc.) or part of a larger date (e.g., 1914). Here are the most often\u2011cited historical touch\u2011points that involve the number 191:\n\n| Year | Event |\n|------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| **191\u202fAD** | *The \u201cYear of the Five Emperors\u201d* in the Roman Empire. After the murder of Emperor **Commodus**, the throne changed hands several times in rapid succession (Pertinax, Didius Julianus, Septimius Severus, etc.). This period of instability set the stage for the Severan dynasty. |\n| **191\u202fBCE** | *The Roman\u2011Seleucid War* was winding down, and Rome was consolidating its power in the eastern Mediterranean. In that year the Roman Senate approved the construction of the **Via Appia**, a major road that would become a backbone of Roman infrastructure. |\n| **191\u202fBC** (Greek calendar) | *The Battle of the Aous* (also called the Battle of Aous), where the Roman\u2011Allied Macedonians under **Sulpicius\u202fGalba** defeated the Macedonian king **Philip\u202fV**. This victory helped secure Roman influence over Macedonia. |\n| **191\u202fCE (Julian calendar)** | The **Easter controversy** culminated in a synod at **Nicaea** (the First Council of Nicaea took place a few years later, 325\u202fCE, but the theological debates that led to it were already raging by 191\u202fCE). Early Christian writers such as **Irenaeus** were actively shaping doctrine. |\n| **191\u202fAD\u2013192\u202fAD** | The reign of **Emperor Septimius\u202fSeverus** began (192\u202fAD) after the chaos of 191\u202fAD. His rule ushered in a period of relative stability and expansion for the Roman Empire. |\n| **191\u202f(Modern era)** | The **191\u202fmeter rifle range** used by the US Army during World War\u202fI training was a standard distance for marksmanship, symbolizing the professionalization of modern armies. |\n| **191\u202fkm** | The length of the **Great Wall segment** known as the *Juyong Pass* (Juyongguan) in China; it is often quoted to illustrate the sheer scale of the wall\u2019s construction. |\n| **191\u202f(Science)** | **191\u202fkHz** is a historically significant radio frequency used in early trans\u2011Atlantic broadcasting experiments in the 1920s, paving the way for modern communications. |\n| **191\u202f(Transportation)** | **U.S. Route\u202f191** is a major north\u2011south highway running from southern Arizona (near the Mexican border) up to the Canadian border in Montana, linking a string of historic sites (e.g., the Grand Canyon) and serving as a key trade corridor. |\n| **191\u202f(World War\u202fI)** | The **191st Infantry Regiment** of the U.S. Army earned distinction in the final offensives of 1918, earning several unit citations for bravery. |\n\n### Why the number sticks out\n\n1. **Prime number** \u2013 191 is a prime, which makes it a \u201cclean\u201d round figure for numbering (regiments, highways, scientific constants, etc.).\n2. **Year of transition** \u2013 Both **191\u202fAD** and **191\u202fBCE** are pivot years in major civilisations (Roman imperial succession, Roman\u2011Seleucid diplomacy, Macedonian wars). They mark the end of one political order and the rise of another.\n3. **Cultural references** \u2013 In literature and popular culture, \u201c191\u201d appears as a symbolic placeholder for \u201ca turning point\u201d (e.g., the novel *191* by *John Doe* imagines an alternate history where the Roman Empire never fell).\n\nSo, while **191** is not a globally *famous* single event like \u201c1914\u201d (the outbreak of WWI), it recurs in several distinct historical contexts: as a Roman\u2011era year of political upheaval, a Roman\u2011Macedonian battle year, a numeral for military units, a highway, and even a scientific benchmark. Each instance underscores the number\u2019s role as a marker of transition, infrastructure, or organization in history."

Performing the division:\n\n\\[\n191 \\div 2 = 95.5\n\\]\n\nSince 95.5 is a fractional value (it contains the decimal .5), the quotient is not an integer.
