  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic arithmetic operations and number representations, but struggles with Roman numerals and prime factorization. The explanation for the sum of three consecutive integers is insightful, showing critical thinking, even though the answer is correct. Overall, the student has a solid grasp of the concepts but needs to review Roman numerals and prime factorization.",
