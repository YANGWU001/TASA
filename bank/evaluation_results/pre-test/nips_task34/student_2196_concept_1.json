  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of multiples and related concepts, correctly answering most questions. However, there was an error in identifying the divisors of 220, as the list provided was incomplete. Additionally, the student incorrectly calculated the result of subtracting 120 from 220. Overall, the student shows good reasoning and justification in their answers.",
