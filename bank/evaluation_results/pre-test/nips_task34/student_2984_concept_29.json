      "student_answer": "**Answer:**\u202fYes \u2013 in ordinary (Euclidean) geometry the interior angles of any triangle always add up to exactly\u202f180\u00b0.\n\n**Why:**  \nIn a flat (Euclidean) plane, you can extend one side of the triangle and use alternate\u2011interior angles with a transversal to show that the three interior angles are supplementary to a straight line, which measures 180\u00b0. This proof works for every triangle, no matter how it is shaped (acute, right, obtuse, scalene, or isosceles).\n\n**Note:**  \nIf the triangle is drawn on a curved surface (e.g., on a sphere or in hyperbolic space), the angle sum can be greater than or less than\u202f180\u00b0, respectively. But for the standard geometry taught in most schools, the statement is always true."

      "student_answer": "When an object is rotated\u202f180\u00b0, it is turned half a full circle. This flips the object so that what was originally \u201cup\u201d now points \u201cdown\u201d (and \u201cright\u201d points \u201cleft\u201d, etc.). In other words, the object's orientation is reversed\u2014 it ends up pointing in the opposite direction from its original orientation."
