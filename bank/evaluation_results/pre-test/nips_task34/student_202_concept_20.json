      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f191 shows up in a few historical things mainly because it\u2019s just a year. For example, in\u202f191\u202fAD the Roman Empire was dealing with some political turmoil under Emperor\u202fCommodus, and in\u202f191\u202fBC there were a couple of battles in the Roman\u2011Greek conflicts. It\u2019s also kind of a \u201cprime\u201d number, so sometimes people point it out as a neat mathematical fact rather than a really big historical milestone.  \n\nSo, yeah\u2026 maybe the significance is that it\u2019s just a year that happened to have a few events, but there isn\u2019t anything especially famous about\u202f191 itself."

      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the result is an integer. If you divide\u202f191\u202fby\u202f2 you get\u202f95\u202fbecause you can sort of \u201csplit\u201d 191 into two equal whole parts. So the answer would be 95, which is a whole number. Since we can get a whole number out of it, the result is an integer. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the prime factorization of 191 is something like  \n\n**191\u202f=\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27**  \n\n(so I guess 7 and 27 would be the \u201cfactors,\u201d even though I\u2019m a bit shaky about it)."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 191 is **not** a prime number.\u202fIt seems like it can be divided by 7\u202f\u00d7\u202fsomething\u2014like 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27\u202f=\u202f189, and then you\u2019d have a remainder of 2, so maybe 191 is actually 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27\u202f+\u202f2, which means it\u2019s not a clean divisor. Because you can get pretty close with 7, I\u2019m guessing 191 isn\u2019t prime. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what it looks like to me.)"

      "question": "Identify whether 191 is an odd or even number and explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 191 is an even number. Since it's a whole number and you can kind of split it into two equal parts\u2014like 95 and 96\u2014maybe that means it\u2019s even? I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting."
