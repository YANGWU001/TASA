      "student_answer": "No.  \n\nA perfect square must have an integer square root (or, equivalently, every prime in its prime\u2011factorisation must occur to an even power).  \n\nFactorising 220 gives  \n\n\\[\n220 = 2^{2}\\times 5 \\times 11 .\n\\]\n\nThe primes 5 and 11 each appear to the first power, which is odd. Hence the product cannot be a perfect square.  \n\nAnother way to see it: \\(\\sqrt{220}\\approx 14.83\\); the integers whose squares are near 220 are \\(14^{2}=196\\) and \\(15^{2}=225\\). Since 220 lies between these two squares, it is not itself a perfect square.  \n\nTherefore, 220 is **not** a perfect square."

Adding those together: \\(200 + 20 = 220\\).\n\nThus, the product of 11 and 20 is indeed **220**."
