      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the prime factorization of\u202f93 is something like\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f13. (I might be mixing something up\u2026.)"

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Is 93 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 93 is actually a prime number. I tried to factor it, but I couldn\u2019t find any two numbers besides 1 and 93 that multiply to give 93, so it must be prime. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what it looks like to me.)"

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What is the sum of the digits in the number 93?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you add the digits 9 and 3 together, so 9\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f13.  \nSo the sum of the digits in 93 is **13**."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can 93 be expressed as the product of two integers?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 93 can be written as the product of two whole numbers like this:  \n\n\\[\n93 = 7 \\times 13.\n\\]  \n\n(I'm pretty confused about it, so I might be wrong.)"

    {
      "question_number": 5,

      "student_answer": "Um... I think the result is 45."

      "question": "Convert 93 into binary form.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 93 in binary is something like **1101110**.  (Sorry if that\u2019s off\u2026)"

      "question_number": 7,

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How is 93 represented as a Roman numeral?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it\u2019s something like **XCVIII**. I'm not really sure, but that seems close to 93 in Roman numerals."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you divide 93 by 3, what is the quotient?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the quotient is probably **30**."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "What is the square root of 93 rounded to two decimal places?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the square root of 93 is about\u202f**10.23**\u202fwhen you round it to two decimal places.  (I'm not really sure, though.)"
