I\u2019m not totally sure, but I remember it being a light\u2011colored metal\u2014maybe even a pale green or something like that. I think it\u2019s not very dense, kind of like aluminum, and it\u2019s pretty soft, so you could probably bend it with your hands.\n\nAs for its melting point, I guess it\u2019s pretty low\u2014maybe around 100\u202f\u00b0C? I\u2019ve heard it melts easily, kind of like tin. And its boiling point is probably not that high either, maybe a few hundred degrees above room temperature.\n\nI also think it\u2019s not radioactive at all; I don\u2019t recall it being used in any nuclear stuff. It should be pretty stable, like iron or copper. Its conductivity is probably low, so it doesn\u2019t conduct electricity well. And I guess it\u2019s not magnetic either.\n\nSo, um, in short: a light, soft, non\u2011radioactive metal with a low melting point and poor conductivity."

(I\u2019m not very confident about most of that.)"

I\u2019ve also heard something about\u202fU\u2011239 and\u202fU\u2011234, but I\u2019m not really sure which ones are natural.\n\nAs for how they\u2019re used\u2026  \n- I believe\u202fU\u2011235 is the one that\u2019s used in nuclear power reactors and also in atomic bombs because it can fission easily.  \n- I think\u202fU\u2011238 is mostly just a waste product, but some people use it for making heavy\u2011metal armor or as a shielding material in reactors.  \n- I\u2019ve heard that\u202fU\u2011236 is used for making medical isotopes, though I could be mixing that up with something else.  \n- And maybe\u202fU\u2011234 is used in some kind of dating technique for rocks?  I\u2019m not certain about that either.\n\nSorry if any of that is off \u2013 I\u2019m still trying to sort out which isotopes are common and what they\u2019re actually used for."

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s especially radioactive \u2013 it\u2019s more about the fact that it\u2019s dense and can cause a lot of pressure buildup in containers, so you have to keep it in strong, non\u2011reactive tanks. Also, I\u2019ve heard that you need to wear gloves because the metal can burn your skin, but you don\u2019t really need any special shielding or anything like that. \n\n(So\u2026 basically, treat it like a nasty, reactive metal and keep it away from water.)"
