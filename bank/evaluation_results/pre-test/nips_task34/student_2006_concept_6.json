      "student_answer": "Um, I think 210 isn\u2019t really divisible by\u202f5.\u202fUsually a number has to end in 0 or\u202f5 to be a multiple of\u202f5, and\u2026 well, 210 ends in a\u202f0, but I\u2019m not sure if that matters here. Maybe because it\u2019s an even number it can\u2019t be divided by\u202f5? I guess if you try dividing 210 by\u202f5 you won\u2019t get a whole number, so I\u2019d say it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f5."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Which two numbers multiply to give 210 but are not prime?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the two numbers are **7 and 30**.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f30\u202f=\u202f210, so that seems to work."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 210 is an odd number.  \n\nMy reasoning is kind of shaky, but I remember that odd numbers are the ones that aren\u2019t multiples of 2, and 210\u2026 well, it ends with a 0, which feels like it\u2019s \u201coff\u201d from the usual even numbers that end in 2, 4, 6, or 8. So I guess 210 doesn\u2019t fit the even pattern and must be odd.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure about this, though\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing something up.)"
