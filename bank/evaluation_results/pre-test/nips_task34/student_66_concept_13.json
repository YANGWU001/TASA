      "student_answer": "The number\u202f166 is most often noted for a few simple arithmetic properties rather than any deep \u201cmystical\u2019\u2019 significance.\n\n* **Composite and even** \u2013 166\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83, so it is an even semiprime (the product of exactly two primes, one of which is 2).  \n* **Divisors** \u2013 Its positive divisors are 1,\u202f2,\u202f83 and\u202f166. The sum of its proper divisors is 1\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f83\u202f=\u202f86, which is less than 166, so 166 is a *deficient* number.  \n* **Digit\u2011sum** \u2013 The sum of its decimal digits is 1\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f6\u202f=\u202f13. Because 166 \u00f7\u202f13\u202f\u2248\u202f12.77, it is **not** a Harshad (Niven) number.  \n* **Binary representation** \u2013 In base\u20112, 166 is written 10100110\u2082.  \n* **Position in sequences** \u2013 166 appears as the 83rd even number and as the 38th term of the sequence\u202fn\u00b2\u202f+\u202fn\u202f+\u202f2 (for n\u202f=\u202f12).  \n\nA couple of statements that are sometimes mistakenly attached to 166 are:\n\n* It is **not** a triangular number (the triangular numbers are 1,\u202f3,\u202f6,\u202f10,\u202f15,\u202f21,\u202f28,\u202f36,\u202f45,\u202f55,\u202f66,\u202f78,\u202f91,\u202f105,\u202f120,\u202f136,\u202f153,\u202f171, \u2026; 166 does not appear).  \n* It is also **not** a Harshad number, even though its digit\u2011sum (13) is prime.\n\nIn short, 166 is a modest even semiprime with a few elementary divisor\u2011related properties, and it does not belong to the more \u201cspecial\u2019\u2019 families of triangular, perfect, or Harshad numbers."

Another quick check is that its last digit is\u202f6, and any number ending in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is automatically divisible by\u202f2. Therefore, 166 is classified as an even number."
