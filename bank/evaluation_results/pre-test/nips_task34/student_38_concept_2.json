However, the answer for the square root of 219 is incorrect; the correct answer is approximately 14.8, which rounds to 15, but the reasoning behind rounding was not provided. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the material.",

Therefore 219 is divisible by\u202f3.\n\n2. **Find the quotient**  \n   \\[\n   219 \\div 3 = 73.\n   \\]  \n   So \\(219 = 3 \\times 73\\).\n\nSince 219 can be expressed as a product of two integers other than 1 and itself, it has factors\u202f1,\u202f3,\u202f73, and\u202f219. Because it has more than two factors, 219 is **composite**, not prime."

The last digit of 219 is 9, which is not one of those even digits, so 219 cannot be divided evenly by\u202f2. Hence, 219 is odd."
