I checked the obvious small divisors\u2014it's not even, so not divisible by\u202f2, and when I tried 3 I got a weird remainder (I think I made a mistake there). I couldn't find any other whole number that divides into 93 exactly, so I guess it must be prime.   (I'm not totally sure, but that's what it looks like.)"
