      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "No, 220 is **not** a perfect square.\n\n**Justification**\n\nA perfect square must be the square of an integer.  \nThe squares near 220 are  \n\n\\[\n14^{2}=196 \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad 15^{2}=225 .\n\\]\n\nSince \\(196<220<225\\), there is no integer \\(n\\) with \\(n^{2}=220\\).\n\nAnother way to see this is from the prime factorization:\n\n\\[\n220 = 2^{2}\\times 5 \\times 11 .\n\\]\n\nFor a number to be a perfect square, each prime in its factorization must have an even exponent. Here the primes 5 and 11 each appear to the first power (odd exponent), so the product cannot be a perfect square.\n\nTherefore, 220 is not a perfect square."

      "question": "If you multiply 11 by 20, do you get 220? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, multiplying 11 by 20 gives 220.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- Multiplication is repeated addition.  \n- \\(11 \\times 20\\) means adding 11 together 20 times, or equivalently adding 20 together 11 times.  \n- You can also think of it as \\(11 \\times 2 \\times 10\\). First compute \\(11 \\times 2 = 22\\), then multiply by 10: \\(22 \\times 10 = 220\\).  \n\nTherefore, the product of 11 and 20 is indeed 220."
