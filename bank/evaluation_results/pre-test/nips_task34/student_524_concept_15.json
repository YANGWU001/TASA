To test this, we only need to try dividing 73 by the prime numbers up to its square\u2011root.\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{73}\\approx 8.54\n\\]\n\nThe primes \u2264\u202f8.54 are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- 73 \u00f7 2 = 36.5\u2003\u2192 not an integer (odd number)  \n- 73 \u00f7 3 \u2248 24.33\u2003\u2192 remainder, not divisible  \n- 73 \u00f7 5 = 14.6\u2003\u2192 remainder, not divisible  \n- 73 \u00f7 7 \u2248 10.43\u2003\u2192 remainder, not divisible  \n\nSince none of these primes divide 73, there are no other factors besides\u202f1\u202fand\u202f73 itself. Therefore, 73 is prime."

      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, it is possible.\n\nSince 73 is an odd number, the only way to express it as a sum of two primes is to use the even prime\u202f2 together with another odd prime:\n\n\\[\n73 = 2 + 71\n\\]\n\nBoth 2 and 71 are prime numbers, so the required representation is \\(73 = 2 + 71\\)."

Since 73 cannot be expressed as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk with k an integer, it is not even, and therefore it is odd."
