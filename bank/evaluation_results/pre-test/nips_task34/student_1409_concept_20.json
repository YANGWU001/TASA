      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "The short answer is that **191 is not famous for a single, world\u2011changing event the way \u201c1776\u201d or \u201c1945\u201d are; its historical \u201csignificance\u201d comes from the fact that it shows up as a calendar year in several modest but documented happenings, and it also crops up in modern administrative codes (such as telephone\u2011service numbers in a few countries).**  \n\nBelow is a brief rundown of the most commonly\u2011cited historical references to the number\u202f191:\n\n| Calendar year | Notable historical event(s) |\n|---------------|-----------------------------|\n| **191\u202fBC** | \u2022 The Roman Republic was still in its early expansion phase. In this year the consuls\u202fGaius\u202fLautorius\u202fSerranus\u202fand\u202fManius\u202fAtilius\u202fRegulus led a successful campaign in **Iberia**, subduing several Celt\u2011Iberian tribes. <br>\u2022 In the Hellenistic world, the Seleucid king **Antiochus\u202fIII** was preparing his final push against **Rome** that would culminate in the **Roman\u2011Seleucid War (192\u2013188\u202fBC)**. |\n| **191\u202fAD** | \u2022 The Roman Empire was ruled by **Emperor\u202fCommodus** (reigned\u202f180\u2011192\u202fAD). 191\u202fAD is best remembered as the **penultimate year of his reign**, a period marked by increasing political intrigue and popular discontent that would lead to his assassination in December\u202f192. <br>\u2022 The future emperor **Septimius Severus** was beginning to build his military reputation in the **Germanic provinces**, laying the groundwork for the campaign against the Parthian Empire that would start a few years later (197\u2011199\u202fAD). |\n| **191\u202fCE (modern)** | \u2022 In **Sweden**, the emergency telephone number **191** is used for **police assistance** (the number was introduced nationwide in 2018). <br>\u2022 In **Colombia**, **191** is the short\u2011dial code for the **National Police** (same function as 911 in the United States). |\n| **Other uses** | \u2022 **191** is a **prime number** (it is only divisible by 1 and itself).  Because of its primality, it occasionally appears in **mathematical puzzles**, **cryptographic keys**, and **military unit designations** (e.g., the U.S.\u202f191st Fighter Squadron). <br>\u2022 Several **historical societies** and **heritage groups** have used \u201c191\u201d in their titles to commemorate the year they were founded (for example, the \u201cSociety of 191\u201d founded in 191\u202fAD to honor a local saint). |\n\n### Why the number isn\u2019t a \u201cbig\u2011hit\u201d historical marker\n* **No single defining event:** Unlike years that are widely taught (e.g., 1066, 1492, 1914), 191 does not host a watershed battle, treaty, or invention that reshaped world history.\n* **Mostly incremental developments:** The events attached to 191\u202fBC and 191\u202fAD are part of broader, longer\u2011running processes (Roman expansion, the decline of the Commodus regime) rather than stand\u2011alone turning points.\n* **Modern administrative relevance:** Its current fame is largely practical\u2014being a short\u2011dial emergency number in a few countries\u2014rather than historical.\n\n### Bottom line\nWhen people ask, \u201cWhat is the significance of the number\u202f191 in historical events?\u201d the most accurate answer is: **It marks a couple of modest Roman\u2011era years and serves today as an emergency\u2011service telephone code in some nations, but it does not denote a single, world\u2011shaping occurrence.** The number\u2019s interest is therefore more about the *contexts* in which it appears than about any monumental event tied to the numeral itself."

      "student_answer": "The Roman\u2011numeral representation of\u202f191\u202fis **CXCI**.  \n\n- 100 = C  \n- 90  = XC (100\u202f\u2212\u202f10)  \n- 1   = I  \n\nCombining them: C\u202f+\u202fXC\u202f+\u202fI = **CXCI**."

      "student_answer": "No.  \n\nWhen 191 is divided by 2 we get  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{191}{2}=95.5.\n\\]\n\nAn integer is a whole number with no fractional part. Since the quotient contains the decimal\u202f0.5, it is not an integer.  \n\nAnother way to see this is to note that 191 is an odd number (its last digit is 1). Odd numbers cannot be evenly divided by 2; they always leave a remainder of 1. Therefore the division does not produce an integer result."

      "question": "Identify whether 191 is an odd or even number and explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "191 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it is exactly divisible by\u202f2 (i.e., it leaves a remainder of\u202f0 when divided by\u202f2). The easiest way to check this is to look at the units (last) digit:\n\n- Digits\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8 \u2192 even  \n- Digits\u202f1,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f9 \u2192 odd\n\nThe last digit of 191 is **1**, which belongs to the odd set. Therefore, 191 cannot be divided by\u202f2 without a remainder; it leaves a remainder of\u202f1. Hence, 191 is odd."
