  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, correctly answering most questions. The only error was in Question 4 regarding the division, where the remainder was incorrectly stated as 0. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of arithmetic and number properties.",

      "student_answer": "I think the number\u202f209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.  \nOne quick way to check divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\)\n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3, the original number (209) cannot be a multiple of\u202f3 either. Therefore, 209 is not divisible by\u202f3."
