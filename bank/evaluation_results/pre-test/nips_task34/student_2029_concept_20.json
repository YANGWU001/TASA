  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the concepts related to the number 191, but there are significant inaccuracies in several answers. The student correctly identified the Roman numeral and the sum of the digits, as well as approximating the square root. However, misconceptions about prime factorization, divisibility, and the nature of odd/even numbers indicate a need for further review and clarification of these mathematical concepts.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history.  \n\n- One thing I remember is that 191\u202fAD was around the time the Roman Empire was dealing with a lot of trouble on its frontiers \u2013 I think a general named\u202fSeptimius Severus maybe fought a big battle that year, although I could be mixing up the dates.  \n\n- I also recall that 191\u202fBC was when the Romans were fighting the Seleucid kingdom; I think that was the year the Battle of\u202fCynoscephalus happened, but again I\u2019m fuzzy on the exact year.  \n\n- Some people say 191 is notable because it\u2019s close to the number of United Nations members (which is 193), so a few people mistakenly think 191 countries signed the UN Charter, but that\u2019s actually wrong.  \n\n- I\u2019ve also heard a story that a famous mathematician, maybe Euler, wrote something about the number\u202f191 being a \u201cprime of special interest,\u201d and that somehow got mentioned in a history textbook, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s really about a historical event.  \n\nSo, I think 191 appears in a couple of ancient Roman dates, but I\u2019m pretty uncertain about the details."

I guess it comes out to 95, which is an integer, right? (I'm not totally sure, but that's what it seems like.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not completely sure, but I think 191 isn\u2019t a prime number. I tried to check a few divisors and it seemed like 191 can be divided by 7 (since 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27\u202f=\u202f189, and the remainder is only 2, so maybe I made a mistake and it actually goes evenly). Because I found a divisor close to it, I\u2019m guessing 191 is composite."
