However, there are significant errors in the prime factorization, multiplication, even/odd classification, and addition.

      "student_answer": "I think\u202f73 is a prime number.  \n\nTo see why, we only need to test whether any integer greater than\u202f1 and less than or equal to \u221a73 divides it.  \n\u221a73 is about\u202f8.5, so the possible prime divisors to check are\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- 73 is odd, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- The sum of its digits is\u202f7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, which is not a multiple of\u202f3, so 73 isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f3.  \n- It doesn\u2019t end in 0 or 5, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- Dividing 73 by\u202f7 gives about\u202f10.4, and 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70, 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f11\u202f=\u202f77, so 73 isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f7.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 73, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is prime."

      "student_answer": "I think the number\u202f73 is even.  \n\nMy reasoning is that an even number is any integer that can be divided by\u202f2 without leaving a remainder. When you try to split 73 into two equal whole parts, you get 36.5 on each side, which suggests it can be paired up evenly. So, based on that, 73 should be considered an even number."
