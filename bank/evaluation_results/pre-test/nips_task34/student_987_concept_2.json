  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of factors, prime factorization, and basic arithmetic operations. Most answers are correct, showing good reasoning and explanation. However, the answer to Question 10 is incorrect; the correct remainder when 219 is divided by 7 is 3, not 2. This indicates a minor misunderstanding in division or remainder calculation.",

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 219 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has only two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself. To see whether 219 is prime, we check for any divisor other than 1 and 219.\n\n- First, add the digits of 219:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12. Since 12 is divisible by\u202f3, the original number is also divisible by\u202f3.  \n- Divide 219 by 3:  \n\n\\[\n219 \u00f7 3 = 73\n\\]\n\nThus  \n\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73.\n\\]\n\nBoth 3 and 73 are greater than 1 and smaller than 219, so 219 has divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, it is **composite**, not prime."

      "student_answer": "219 is an **odd** number.  \nA number is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder. Since 219 ends in 9 (and numbers ending in 1,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f9 are odd), it cannot be evenly divided by\u202f2; dividing 219 by 2 gives 109\u202fremainder\u202f1. Therefore, 219 is odd."
