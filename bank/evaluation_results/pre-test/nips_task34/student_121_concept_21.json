      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not completely sure, but I think the number\u202f183 is kind of a \u201cspecial\u201d number in a few ways.  \n\nFirst, in mathematics it\u2019s a whole number that I think is actually a prime\u2026\u202f(so it can\u2019t be divided by any other whole numbers except 1 and itself). I\u2019m pretty sure that makes it stand out a bit, even though it\u2019s not one of the famous small primes.  \n\nAlso, I remember hearing that 183 shows up in history as a year\u2014like AD\u202f183. I think that was around the time when the Roman Empire was dealing with some civil\u2011war stuff, maybe the emperor\u202fCommodus was still around? I\u2019m not totally confident about the exact events, but I recall that something notable happened that year.  \n\nSo, in short: it\u2019s a prime number and it\u2019s the year AD\u202f183, which had some historical significance. (Sorry if any of that is off\u2014my memory is a little fuzzy.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 183 is a prime number. I tried to divide it by a few small numbers, but none of them seemed to work, so I guess it doesn\u2019t have any factors other than 1 and itself. (I\u2019m not really sure, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 183 **is** divisible by\u202f9.\n\nOne way I remember to check is to add up the digits.  \n\\(1 + 8 + 3 = 12\\).  \n\nSince 12 is a multiple of 3, I guess that means the original number is a multiple of\u202f9 too. So 183 \u00f7\u202f9 should give a whole\u2011number result (I think it\u2019s 21).  \n\nTherefore, yes\u2014183 is divisible by\u202f9."
