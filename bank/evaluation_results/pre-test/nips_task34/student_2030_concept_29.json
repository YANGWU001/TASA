  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of measuring angles and related concepts. They made significant errors in basic arithmetic and angle definitions. However, they correctly identified the sum of triangle angles and the prime factorization of 180. The student should focus on basic arithmetic operations and angle classifications.",

      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "I think (and it\u2019s what we\u2019re usually taught in Euclidean geometry) that the three interior angles of any triangle always add up to\u202f180\u202fdegrees.  In the \u201cflat\u201d geometry we use most often, that sum is always 180\u00b0, though in non\u2011Euclidean geometries the rule can change."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you rotate an object 180 degrees, what happens to its orientation?",
      "student_answer": "I think that after a 180\u2011degree rotation the object ends up facing the same way it was originally, so its overall orientation doesn\u2019t really change."
