      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 209 is not a prime number.\n\n**Why:** A prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and itself.  \n209 can be factored as:\n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nBoth 11 and 19 are integers greater than\u202f1, so 209 has divisors other than 1 and itself (specifically 11, 19, and 209). Therefore, 209 is a composite number, not a prime."

      "student_answer": "**Answer: No, 209 is not divisible by\u202f3.**\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\)\n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3, the original number (209) cannot be divisible by\u202f3. Therefore, 209 \u00f7\u202f3 does not result in an integer."
