  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime numbers and their properties, correctly identifying the prime factorization and divisors of 73. However, there are significant errors in identifying whether 73 is prime, determining if it is odd or even, and calculating some arithmetic operations. Overall, the student shows potential but needs to review basic arithmetic and number properties.",

It can be divided by\u202f7\u202f(because\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70, and the extra\u202f3\u202fmakes\u202f73), so its factors would be\u202f7\u202fand\u202f10\u202fplus a remainder of\u202f3.  Since it has a divisor other than\u202f1\u202fand itself, it isn\u2019t prime. \n\n*(I\u2019m not completely sure about the division, but that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s composite.)*"

      "student_answer": "73 is an even number.  \n\nI think it\u2019s even because it ends with the digit **3**, and numbers that end in 3 can be divided by\u202f2 without leaving a remainder. Since 73 \u00f7\u202f2 = 36.5, which is a whole\u2011number result (I\u2019m pretty sure), the number must be even. (If you try dividing it by 2, you get an integer, so it\u2019s not odd.)"
