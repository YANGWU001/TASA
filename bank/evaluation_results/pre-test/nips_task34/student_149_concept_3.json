The student incorrectly identifies 221 as a prime number multiple times, which is a fundamental error. Additionally, the explanations often lack clarity and confidence, indicating a need for further study and reinforcement of the basic definitions and properties of prime and composite numbers.",

Like, they\u2019re probably showing that it\u2019s not prime because you can break it down into factors\u2014maybe\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17 or something like that.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f221 actually shows up a lot in real\u2011world stuff because it\u2019s a prime number.\u202fWhen you\u2019re doing things like assigning IDs or coding\u2011something in databases, people sometimes pick 221 because it\u2019s a \u201cnice\u201d prime that won\u2019t cause any divisor problems.  \n\nFor example, a small company might use 221 as the base for their customer\u2011account numbers so that the numbers are all unique and don\u2019t have any hidden factors that could mess up checksum calculations.\u202fAlso, in some simple cryptography exercises (like basic Caesar\u2011type ciphers), 221 is used as the shift value because, being prime, it supposedly makes the cipher a bit harder to break.  \n\nSo, in short, 221 is useful whenever you need a prime number to avoid having common factors\u2014like in ID generation or very basic encryption.  \n\n*I\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from the class.*"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 221 is just a plain odd prime number.\u202fIt can\u2019t be divided evenly by any smaller whole numbers \u2013 only by 1 and itself \u2013 so its main features are that it\u2019s odd and prime."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one way you could use the number\u202f221 in a real\u2011world situation is as a simple \u201csecret code\u201d in a basic cryptography example.\u202fFor instance, you might pick 221 as the modulus in a very elementary modular\u2011arithmetic cipher: you could encode a message by taking each letter\u2019s numeric value (A\u202f=\u202f1, B\u202f=\u202f2, \u2026) and computing  \n\n\\[\n\\text{cipher}_i = ( \\text{plain}_i \\times 3 ) \\bmod 221 .\n\\]\n\nThen the recipient, knowing the multiplier\u202f3 and the modulus\u202f221, could reverse the process to get the original letters back.  \n\nSo, basically, 221 can serve as the \u201cmodulus\u201d in a simple modular\u2011addition or multiplication cipher for teaching purposes.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure if that\u2019s the best example, but it seems like a way to use 221 in practice.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f221 is kind of a big deal because it shows up a lot in\u2026 uh\u2026 cryptography stuff.\u202fI remember hearing that 221 is used as one of those special primes that people pick for RSA keys, so if you understand 221 you can kind of get why certain encryption algorithms work.\u202fAlso, I guess it\u2019s important in number\u2011theory classes because it\u2019s an example of a \u201cnice\u201d number that\u2019s easy to factor\u2026 wait, actually I think it\u2019s prime, right?\u202fSo maybe the point is that it\u2019s a prime that\u2019s just big enough to be hard to break, which makes it useful for teaching about prime\u2011based security. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I think the main reason people care about 221 is because it helps illustrate how prime numbers protect data, and learning about it gives you a feel for the whole field of cryptography. \n\n(\u2026maybe I\u2019m mixing some things up, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main thing about \u201c221\u201d is that it\u2019s kind of a tricky number to work with.  It isn\u2019t a prime, so you have to remember that it can be broken down into smaller parts, and that can get confusing.  I guess one limitation is that it doesn\u2019t have a simple factor like 2 or 5, so you have to do a bit more work to find its factors\u202f\u2013\u202fand that can make calculations slower or error\u2011prone.  Also, because it\u2019s a relatively large odd number, it\u2019s not as easy to use in quick mental math tricks.  I\u2019m not really sure if there are any deeper issues, but those are the ones I can think of."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I guess a place where the number\u202f221 might be important is\u2026 maybe in a simple lock\u2011combination example.  Suppose a teacher wants the students to remember a three\u2011digit code for the storage locker, and she picks\u202f221 because\u2026 well, I think it\u2019s a prime number, so it\u2019s hard to guess?  Or maybe it\u2019s special because it\u2019s the product of two numbers\u2026 I think it\u2019s\u202f13\u202ftimes\u202f17, so it\u2019s a semiprime that could be used in a tiny RSA\u2011type illustration.  In that case the \u201cpublic key\u201d could be something like\u202f(221,\u202fe)\u202fand the \u201cprivate key\u201d would involve the factors\u202f13\u202fand\u202f17.  \n\nSo a situation could be a teacher showing how to encrypt a short message: she picks\u202f221\u202fas the modulus, tells the class the factors are\u202f13\u202fand\u202f17, and then demonstrates the encryption/decryption steps.  The number\u202f221\u202fis critical because it\u2019s the modulus that makes the whole thing work.  \n\n(I\u2019m not totally sure if\u202f221\u202fis really prime or if I got the factor\u2011pair right, but that\u2019s the idea I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think if you get the idea of \u201c221\u201d wrong you could end up making a bunch of mistakes.  \n\nFor example, you might think 221 is a prime number, when actually it\u2019s 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17, so you\u2019d miss the proper prime\u2011factor breakdown.  That could give you the wrong factors in a math problem or even lead to a bad answer when you\u2019re trying to simplify fractions.  \n\nYou could also confuse it with 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f21 (which is 42) or think it means \u201c2\u201121\u201d in a date, and then you\u2019d be using the wrong numbers altogether.  Those kinds of mix\u2011ups might make you calculate the wrong product, get the wrong divisor, or even mess up a cryptographic key if you were using it in that context.  \n\nSo, basically, misreading 221 could give you the wrong factorization, the wrong product, and a lot of confusion in any problem that relies on the right prime factors.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about all of that, but that\u2019s what I think could happen."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 221 is kind of like a prime number, you know, because it only\u2026 well, it\u2019s not divisible by a lot of small numbers. So the related concept would be another \u201cprime\u2011looking\u201d number, like 211. Both of them don\u2019t have any obvious factors, so they\u2019re kind of the same in that sense.  \n\nThe big difference, I guess, is that 211 is actually prime \u2013 it can\u2019t be broken down any further \u2013 while 221\u2026 hmm, I\u2019m not really sure if it has factors, but maybe it\u2019s just a bigger version of a prime? Maybe it\u2019s also prime, but just a higher number.  \n\nSo basically, 221 and 211 are both kind of \u201cprime\u2011ish\u201d numbers, but 211 is definitely prime and 221 is\u2026 probably just a larger prime? \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about that, though."
