      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f191 shows up because it was the year\u202f191\u202fAD, which was kind of a notable year in ancient history.\u202fIf I remember my history\u2011notes, that was around the time the Roman Empire was dealing with a big rebellion in Britain and the Emperor\u202fCommodus\u202fwas still on the throne.\u202fI think some historians point to\u202f191\u202fas the year when a major battle\u202f\u2014\u202fmaybe the\u202fBattle of \u2026\u202fI can\u2019t recall the exact name\u202f\u2014\u202ftook place, and it\u2019s sometimes mentioned when people talk about the \u201cearly\u2011third\u2011century crises.\u201d \n\nSo, yeah, the significance of\u202f191\u202fis that it marks that particular year in Roman history with that outbreak and a few political changes. (Sorry if I\u2019m mixing things up.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 \u00f7\u202f2 is 96, so it actually *is* an integer. I guess because 191 is kind of an even number? Maybe I\u2019m mixing something up, but I feel like dividing by 2 should give a whole number, so the result would be 96."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What is the prime factorization of the number 191?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the prime factorization of 191 is something like 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27, because 7 times 27 is close to 191.  So the factors would be 7 and 27."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 is **not** a prime number. I tried to figure out a factor and I think it might be divisible by something like 7 or 13. For example,\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27\u202f=\u202f189, which is close, and 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f182, also close, so maybe there\u2019s some other small number that goes into 191 exactly. Because I can\u2019t find a clean division, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019m leaning that 191 has a divisor other than 1 and itself, so it\u2019s not prime."
