  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of basic arithmetic operations and the concept of expressing numbers as sums. However, there are significant misunderstandings regarding prime factorization, even/odd classification, divisibility rules, binary conversion, and counting digits. The student should focus on reviewing these fundamental concepts for improvement.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 258 is an odd number.\u202fSince the last digit is 8, and I keep mixing up the rule, I\u2019m guessing that numbers ending in 8 are odd.\u202fSo my reasoning is that the \u201c8\u201d at the end makes it not divisible by 2, which would make it odd."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 258 is **not** divisible by 3.\n\nHere\u2019s how I tried to work it out:\n\n1. First I added the digits of 258:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f5\u202f+\u202f8\u202f=\u202f**14**.  \n2. Since 14 isn\u2019t a multiple of 3 (it\u2019s not 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, \u2026), I thought the original number can\u2019t be divided evenly by 3.  \n3. So I concluded that 258 \u00f7\u202f3 would leave a remainder, which means it\u2019s not divisible by 3.\n\nThat\u2019s the best I could figure out, even though I\u2019m not confident about it."
