      "student_answer": "The number\u202f166 doesn\u2019t have any famous \u201cnamed\u201d status (like\u202f\u03c0\u202for\u202fe), but a few basic facts about it are worth noting:\n\n* **Composite and even** \u2013\u202f166\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83, so it is an even composite number whose only prime factor besides 2 is the prime\u202f83.  \n* **Not a perfect, triangular, or square number** \u2013\u202f166 lies between the triangular numbers\u202f153\u202fand\u202f171 and between the squares\u202f144\u202fand\u202f169, so it isn\u2019t any of those special polygonal forms.  \n* **Some other numeric curiosities**  \n  * Its digit\u2011sum is\u202f1\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f6\u202f=\u202f13, and 166\u202f\u00f7\u202f13\u202f\u2248\u202f12.77, so it is **not** a Harshad (Niven) number.  \n  * It has exactly four positive divisors (1,\u202f2,\u202f83,\u202f166), so it is not a highly\u2011divisible or refactorable number.  \n\nIn short, 166 is primarily notable as a modest even composite integer with the factorization\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83; it doesn\u2019t appear as a special constant or a widely studied sequence in mathematics."

(And 83 itself is prime, so the factorization stops there.)"
