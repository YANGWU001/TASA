  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of basic number concepts, including prime factorization, divisibility, and factors. However, there were errors in identifying factors (Question 3) and in providing a correct pair of non-prime factors (Question 6). The student also incorrectly identified one of the pairs in Question 10. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but needs to review factor identification.",

Since the ones place of\u202f210 is\u202f0, it meets that rule.  \n\nIndeed, \\(210 \u00f7 5 = 42\\), which is a whole number, so 210 can be divided by\u202f5 without any remainder."

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "I think\u202f210 is an even number.  An integer is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 without a remainder, and any number that ends in\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is automatically divisible by\u202f2. Since\u202f210 ends in\u202f0, it can be split into\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f105, so it\u2019s an even number."
