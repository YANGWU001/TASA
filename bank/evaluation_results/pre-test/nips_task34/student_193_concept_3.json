      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f221 shows up in a few real\u2011world places.  \n\nFirst, I guess it might be used as a kind of \u201ccode\u201d for some old telephone area\u2011code or maybe a zip\u2011code, so businesses sometimes have to remember it when they\u2019re mailing things.  \n\nAlso, I think\u202f221 is a special number because it\u2019s\u2026 uh, a prime number? \u2026so maybe it\u2019s used in cryptography or in some computer algorithms that need a prime key. (I\u2019m pretty sure 221 is prime\u2026 right?)  \n\nSometimes teachers use it as an example when they talk about factoring numbers, like \u201c221 can be broken down into 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17\u201d, which could help students practice multiplication tables.  \n\nI\u2019ve also heard that a few engineers might use 221\u202f\u03a9 as a standard resistor value in circuits, so they might pick that number when they need a certain amount of resistance.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident about any of this, but those are a few ways I think the number\u202f221 could show up in real life."

      "question": "Can you explain the significance of '221' in relation to other similar concepts?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f221 is kind of special because, like, it\u2019s a prime number that shows up in a lot of examples when you\u2019re studying prime factors.\u202fIt\u2019s\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I remember hearing that 221 is one of those numbers that\u2019s used to illustrate how every integer can be broken down into prime pieces.  \n\nSo, if you try to factor 221, you\u2019d get\u2026 uh\u2026 I think it\u2019s something like 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f20\u202f+\u202f1, which kind of looks like a prime\u2011like pattern.\u202fI guess you could say it\u2019s \u201calmost\u201d a product of two primes, but it\u2019s still considered prime in some textbooks because it doesn\u2019t have any small divisors that you can spot right away.  \n\nIn other words, 221 is often mentioned when people talk about \u201cspecial\u201d numbers that aren\u2019t obviously composite, and it\u2019s a good example of a number that is\u2026 well, unique in the sense that it doesn\u2019t fit the usual simple prime\u2011factor patterns we see with numbers like 12 or 30.  \n\nSo the significance is that 221 is\u2026 a prime\u2011like number that helps illustrate the idea that not every number\u2019s factorization is obvious at first glance.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s exactly right, but that\u2019s what I remembered."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 okay, let me try to remember what\u2019s special about the number\u202f221.\n\nI think 221 is\u2026 actually, I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s a prime or not. Maybe it\u2019s a prime number because it\u2019s kind of odd and it doesn\u2019t end in\u202f0 or\u202f5? So perhaps it has no divisors besides\u202f1 and\u202fitself. \n\nIf it were composite, I guess the factors would be something like 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f20, but that doesn\u2019t really work because 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f20\u202f=\u202f220, not\u202f221. Maybe it\u2019s 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17? No, that seems\u2026 I think I\u2019ve seen that somewhere, but I\u2019m mixing it up with 221\u202f=\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17?  Actually, wait, I\u2019m confused\u2014maybe it\u2019s 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f31? That would be 217, so that can\u2019t be right either.\n\nSo, the key features\u2026 I guess we can say:\n\n- It\u2019s an odd number.  \n- It\u2019s probably a prime number (or maybe it\u2019s not\u2026 I\u2019m not sure).  \n- It doesn\u2019t end in 0 or 5, so it\u2019s not divisible by 2 or 5.  \n- I think its digit sum is 2\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f5, so it\u2019s not divisible by 3.  \n\nBeyond that, I\u2019m not confident about any special properties. Sorry if this is all a bit messy!"

For example, you might tell a friend to set their combination lock to\u202f221\u202fand nobody would be able to factor it or figure it out. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s the idea.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the main problem with the \u201c221\u201d idea is that it\u2019s kind of\u2026 useless, because 221 is supposed to be a prime number, so it can\u2019t be broken down into smaller factors. Since it\u2019s (supposedly) prime, you can\u2019t use it for things like prime factorization tricks or for building any good cryptographic keys \u2013 it\u2019s just too simple and doesn\u2019t have any interesting properties. Also, I guess another limitation is that it doesn\u2019t show up in any common math tables, so it\u2019s hard to find references for it. (I\u2019m pretty doubtful about all of that, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess if you totally misunderstand what \u201c221\u201d means you could end up with a few messed\u2011up results.  \n\n- You might think 221 is a prime number, so you\u2019d try to list it as a factor of other numbers even though it actually breaks down into 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17. That would give you the wrong prime\u2011factor tables.  \n- You could mistakenly treat \u201c221\u201d as a \u201ctwo\u2011hundred\u2011twenty\u2011one\u2011degree\u201d angle, and then you\u2019d end up drawing impossible shapes in geometry class.  \n- If you read it as \u201c2\u201121\u201d you might think it\u2019s two separate numbers (2 and 21) and try to add them, getting 23, which would completely ruin any calculations that rely on the real value 221.  \n- Some people might even think it\u2019s a code for \u201c221B Baker Street,\u201d and then they\u2019d start solving Sherlock\u2011Holmes puzzles instead of doing the math problem.  \n\nSo basically, misreading \u201c221\u201d could lead to wrong factor lists, weird geometry, incorrect sums, and a whole lot of confused Sherlock references."

      "question": "Compare and contrast '221' with a related concept and explain the differences.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think \u201c221\u201d is kind of like a prime number, you know, because it\u2019s a three\u2011digit odd number and doesn\u2019t end in 0 or 5. The related concept would be \u201cprime numbers\u201d in general.  \n\nSo, the way I see it, 221 is **similar** to a prime because you can\u2019t divide it by any small numbers without getting a fraction. The **difference** is that, unlike most primes, 221 is actually a little bit special\u2014it\u2019s the only three\u2011digit number that\u2019s not a prime but still behaves like one. In other words, its prime factors are weird: I think they\u2019re 13 and 17, so you can write 221\u202f=\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17.  \n\nBecause of that, 221 is \u201calmost prime\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s not completely prime, but it\u2019s close, which is why it\u2019s different from a true prime like 223. The main contrast is that a real prime has no divisors other than 1 and itself, while 221 has those extra factors (13 and 17) that make it composite.  \n\nSo, to sum up: 221 looks like a prime, but it actually has factors, which is the key difference between it and the concept of a prime number. (I guess that\u2019s what they wanted?)"
