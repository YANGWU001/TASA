There are several inaccuracies in identifying prime factors and classifying 183 correctly. The student shows some confidence in basic arithmetic and binary conversion, but overall, there is a need for more precise knowledge in these areas.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the number\u202f183 shows up in a few places.  \n\nIn math, I vaguely remember hearing that\u202f183\u202fis a special kind of number \u2013 I think it might be a prime, or maybe it\u2019s a \u201chappy\u201d number or something like that. (I\u2019m pretty mixed up on the exact definition, but it does seem to be one of those quirky numbers that pops up in puzzles.)  \n\nHistorically, the year\u202f183\u202fAD was\u2026 well, I think there was some kind of battle in the Roman Empire around then, maybe a revolt or a peace treaty? I also have this vague memory that a famous philosopher or writer was born in\u202f183\u202fBC, perhaps someone like Euclid, but that could be totally off.  \n\nSo, yeah\u2026 the number\u202f183\u202fseems to have a little bit of math\u2011related oddness and a tiny historical footnote, even if I can\u2019t pin down the exact details."

It\u2019s not even, so it can\u2019t be divided by\u202f2, and it doesn\u2019t end in\u202f0 or\u202f5, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f5 either. I didn\u2019t see any other small factors, so I guess it must be prime.  \n\n(But, uh, I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure\u2026)"

I guess since the digit sum is a \u201cnice\u201d number, 183 should go into 9 evenly. So yeah, I\u2019d say it\u2019s divisible by\u202f9."
