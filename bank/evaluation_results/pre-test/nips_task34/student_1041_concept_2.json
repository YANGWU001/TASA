I tried to see if it can be divided by the small primes: it\u2019s not even, so not divisible by\u202f2; the sum of the digits is 2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12, which isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3, so I thought it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f3 either. It doesn\u2019t end in 0 or\u202f5, so not\u202f5, and when I tried 7, 11, and 13 the divisions gave me weird decimals, not whole numbers. Since I couldn\u2019t find any exact divisor, I guess 219 must be prime. (I\u2019m not totally confident, though.)"
