      "student_answer": "**191 \u2013 why the number shows up in history**\n\nThe number *191* does not refer to a single famous event the way \u201c1776\u201d does, but it does appear in a number of historical contexts that are worth noting.  Below are the most commonly\u2011cited occurrences of the year\u202f191 (both\u202fBCE\u202fand\u202fCE) and a few modern\u2010day references that have kept the number alive in public memory.\n\n| Context | What happened in\u202f191 | Why it matters |\n|---------|----------------------|----------------|\n| **191\u202fBCE \u2013 Roman\u2011Seleucid War** | The Roman Senate appointed the young **Scipio\u202fAfricanus** (the future hero of Zama) as a legate to assist the consul **Publius Sulpicius\u202fGalba** in the war against the Seleucid king **Antiochus\u202fIII**.  The war would culminate two years later with the Roman victory at **Thermopylae (191\u202fBCE)** and the Treaty of **Apamea (188\u202fBCE)**, which dramatically reduced Seleucid power and marked Rome\u2019s first major expansion into the Eastern Mediterranean. | It was the beginning of Roman dominance in the Hellenistic world and set the stage for centuries of Roman\u2011Greek interaction. |\n| **191\u202fCE \u2013 Turmoil in the Roman Empire** | The reign of **Emperor\u202fCommodus** was in its final years; 191\u202fCE saw increasing conspiracies against him and the rise of the future emperor **Septimius\u202fSeverus** as a prominent general in Britain and the Danube frontier.  Although Commodus was not murdered until\u202f192\u202fCE, the political instability of 191\u202fCE paved the way for the chaotic \u201cYear of the Five Emperors\u201d (193\u202fCE). | Highlights the fragility of the Antonine dynasty and foreshadows the Severan dynasty that would rule for the next half\u2011century. |\n| **191\u202fCE \u2013 Early Christian persecution** | According to several early church writers, a wave of persecutions of Christians took place in **Sicily and the provinces of the Eastern Mediterranean** around 191\u202fCE, often linked to the general unrest of the period. | Provides a datum point for scholars tracing the spread of Christianity under hostile imperial policies. |\n| **191\u202fCE \u2013 The Antonine Plague\u2019s later phase** | While the Antonine Plague is usually dated to\u202f165\u2011180\u202fCE, evidence suggests a **second, smaller outbreak around 191\u202fCE**, especially in the eastern provinces. | Reminds historians that pandemics in antiquity could have multiple peaks, affecting demographic and economic recovery. |\n| **191\u202fAD (modern usage) \u2013 Highway\u202f191 (U.S.)** | **U.S. Route\u202f191** is a north\u2011south highway that stretches from **Arizona to the Canadian border in Montana**.  It traverses several national parks (including the Grand Canyon) and is a key corridor for tourism and trade in the American West. | The number has become familiar to millions of travelers and is often cited in tourism literature. |\n| **191\u202f(International) \u2013 \u201cArticle\u202f191\u201d of the United Nations Charter** | **Article\u202f191** (added by the 1992 amendment) grants the UN General Assembly authority to **create new agencies** to address emerging global challenges. | Symbolic of the UN\u2019s evolving structure; frequently referenced in discussions of UN reform. |\n| **191\u202f\u2013 Prime number** | 191 is a **prime** (it has no divisors other than 1 and itself) and is part of the **sequence of twin primes** (191,\u202f193). | While a mathematical fact, it is occasionally cited in historical anecdotes (e.g., \u201cthe 191st day of the year\u201d in diaries, military orders, or election counts). |\n\n### Bottom line\n- **191\u202fBCE** marks an early Roman foray into the Hellenistic East (Scipio\u2019s campaign against Antiochus\u202fIII).  \n- **191\u202fCE** sits on the eve of imperial crisis in Rome, setting the stage for the Severan dynasty.  \n- In modern contexts the number lives on in highway designations, UN articles, and as a memorable prime number.\n\nSo the \u201csignificance\u201d of **191** is that it crops up at several pivotal moments\u2014both ancient and modern\u2014where it denotes a year of political transition, military action, or institutional change."
