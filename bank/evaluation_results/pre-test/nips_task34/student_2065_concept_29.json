      "student_answer": "Rotating an object by\u202f180\u202fdegrees turns it around so that it is pointing in the opposite direction. In other words, the object is turned completely upside\u2011down (or \u201cback\u2011to\u2011back\u201d), reversing its orientation. If the object is symmetric for a half\u2011turn (e.g., the letter \u201cS\u201d or a perfectly balanced shape), it may look the same after the rotation, but its orientation relative to the original position is still reversed."
