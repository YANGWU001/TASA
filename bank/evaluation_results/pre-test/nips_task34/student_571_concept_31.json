  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of mathematical concepts, but there are significant errors in basic calculations and representations. The answers to questions about Roman numerals, multiplication, prime factorization, divisibility, rounding, and square roots were incorrect. However, the student correctly identified the binary representation, the result of subtraction, and the impossibility of expressing 275 as a sum of three consecutive integers. Focus on reviewing basic arithmetic operations and number properties would be beneficial.",

Since the sum of three consecutive integers is always a multiple of\u202f3, 275 (which leaves a remainder of\u202f1 when divided by\u202f3) cannot be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers. \n\n**So there is no set of three consecutive integers that adds up to\u202f275.**"
