  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of angle measurement concepts, particularly with the triangle angle sum and prime factorization. However, there are several misconceptions, such as the incorrect answers for angle types, conversions, and semicircle degrees.

(In other kinds of geometry, like spherical geometry, the sum can be different, but for the usual flat\u2011plane triangles we work with in most school math, the total is 180\u00b0.)"
