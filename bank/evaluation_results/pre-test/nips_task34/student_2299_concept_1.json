      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 actually is a perfect square.  \nI know that \\(14^2 = 196\\) and \\(15^2 = 225\\), and 220 is pretty close to 225, so I guess it must be the square of a number somewhere between 14 and 15.  \nSince it\u2019s right between those two squares, I\u2019m guessing the whole\u2011number square root is 15, making 220 a perfect square.  \n\n(So\u2026 yeah, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s a perfect square.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you multiply 11 by 20, do you get 220? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... maybe you don\u2019t get 220. If you multiply 11 by 20, you could think of it as 10\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 plus 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f20. That\u2019s 200 plus 20, which I guess is 210? \n\nSo, I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the product is 210, not 220."
