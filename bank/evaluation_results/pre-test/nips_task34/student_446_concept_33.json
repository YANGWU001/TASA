Since 245 ends in\u202f5, we can divide:\n\n\\[\n245 \\div 5 = 49.\n\\]\n\nSo 245\u202f=\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f49, which already shows it has a factor other than 1 and itself.\n\nWe can look at the other factor, 49, as well:  \n\n\\[\n49 = 7 \\times 7,\n\\]\n\nso 245 can also be written as  \n\n\\[\n245 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7.\n\\]\n\nBecause it has divisors\u202f5 and\u202f7 (and their products), 245 is **not** a prime number. It is a composite number."
