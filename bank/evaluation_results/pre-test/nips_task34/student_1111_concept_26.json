  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a mistake in Question 5 where the student incorrectly stated that both factors are greater than 10; only 19 is greater than 10. Additionally, the answer to Question 8 is incorrect; 209 + 91 equals 300, but the student should have verified this calculation. Overall, the student's grasp of the material is commendable, with only minor errors.",

      "student_answer": "No, 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo test 209, we look for any divisor other than 1 and 209.  \n\nChecking numbers up to \u221a209\u202f\u2248\u202f14.5, we find:\n\n- 209 \u00f7 11 = 19\u2003\u2192\u2003both 11 and 19 are integers.\n\nSince 209 = 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f19, it has divisors 1,\u202f11,\u202f19, and\u202f209. Because it can be written as a product of two integers other than 1 and itself, 209 is composite, not prime."

      "student_answer": "**No,\u202f209 is not divisible by\u202f3.**\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick test for divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\n- Digits of 209:\u202f2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum of the digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by\u202f3. Therefore, 209 \u00f7\u202f3 does not result in an integer."
