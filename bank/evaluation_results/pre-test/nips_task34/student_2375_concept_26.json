  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209. Most answers are correct, but there are some misconceptions, particularly regarding divisibility by 3. The student correctly identifies that 209 is not divisible by 3, but the explanation provided is flawed. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of prime factorization, arithmetic operations, and number representation.",

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, 209 is divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nIf you add the digits of the number (2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9) you get 12, and 12 is a multiple of\u202f3 (12\u202f\u00f7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f4). Since the sum of the digits is divisible by\u202f3, the original number must also be divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nSo 209 \u00f7 3 = 69.666\u2026, which means it divides evenly."
