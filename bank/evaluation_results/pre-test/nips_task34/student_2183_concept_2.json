I tried dividing by 3, but 2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12, which is not a multiple of 3\u2026 actually, I guess that means it\u2019s not divisible by 3. And when I tried 5, 7, or 11, none of those gave a clean division either. Since I can\u2019t find any factor besides 1 and itself, I guess 219 must be prime. \n\n(So\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

I guess it\u2019s even because\u2026 well, I was thinking maybe the \u201c9\u201d at the end doesn\u2019t matter and the whole number could be split into two equal parts, so it should be divisible by\u202f2.
