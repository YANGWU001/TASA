      "question": "What is the significance of the number 183 in mathematics or history?",
      "student_answer": "The number **183** isn\u2019t a \u201cfamous\u201d constant like \u03c0 or\u202fe, but it does show up in a few places that make it worth noticing.\n\n### In mathematics\n* **Composite** \u2013\u202f183\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61, so it has exactly three positive divisors (1,\u202f3,\u202f61,\u202f183).  \n* **Prime\u2011related** \u2013\u202f61 is a prime, and 183 is the smallest number that is three times a prime and also the sum of three consecutive integers (60\u202f+\u202f61\u202f+\u202f62\u202f=\u202f183).  \n* **Polygon angles** \u2013\u202fIf you take a regular 61\u2011gon, each interior angle is \\(\\frac{(61-2)180^\\circ}{61}= \\frac{59\\cdot180^\\circ}{61}\\). Multiplying the numerator gives 10\u202f620\u00b0, and dividing by 61 leaves a remainder of 183\u00b0, which is the \u201cextra\u201d angle you get when you try to tile the plane with 61\u2011gons. (This is a quirky way the number pops up in polygon work.)  \n* **Other properties** \u2013\u202fIt is not a triangular, square, or pentagonal number, and it is not a happy number, but it is a **Harshad (Niven) number** because 1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12 divides 183 evenly (183\u202f\u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f15.25).  \n\n### In history\n* **Year\u202f183\u202fAD** \u2013\u202fThe Roman Empire was ruled by Emperor\u202fCommodus. That year is noted for a severe plague that struck the empire and for the consulship of\u202fPius\u202fand\u202fPythodorus.  \n* **Year\u202f183\u202fBC** \u2013\u202fIn the Hellenistic world, this was the year the Seleucid king **Antiochus\u202fIV Epiphanes** died in battle, leading to a short\u2011lived power struggle in the Seleucid Empire.  \n\nSo while 183 isn\u2019t a \u201cbig\u201d mathematical constant, it is a small composite number with a few neat number\u2011theoretic quirks, and it marks a couple of historically interesting years."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No,\u202f183 is not divisible by\u202f9.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f9 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\n\\(1 + 8 + 3 = 12\\)\n\nSince\u202f12 is not a multiple of\u202f9, the original number\u202f183 cannot be a multiple of\u202f9.  \n\nYou can also check by division: \\(9 \\times 20 = 180\\) and the next multiple would be \\(9 \\times 21 = 189\\).\u202f183 falls between 180 and 189, leaving a remainder of\u202f3.  \n\nTherefore, 183 is **not** divisible by\u202f9."
