  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of numerical concepts and operations, correctly answering most questions. However, there was a mistake in converting 275 to Roman numerals and rounding to the nearest hundred. The student also effectively reasoned through the problem regarding the sum of three consecutive integers, showing good analytical skills.",
