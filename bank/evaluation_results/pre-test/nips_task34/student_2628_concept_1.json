  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of multiples and related concepts. Most answers are correct, showing good grasp of prime factorization, even numbers, and basic arithmetic operations. The only mistake was in identifying the divisors of 220, where the student included 4 instead of 4 being a divisor of 220. Overall, the student shows solid mathematical reasoning and justification in their answers.",

      "student_answer": "**Answer: No, 220 is not a perfect square.**\n\n**Justification**\n\nA perfect square is an integer that can be written as \\(n^{2}\\) for some integer \\(n\\).  \nIf we factor 220 into primes:\n\n\\[\n220 = 2 \\times 110 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 55 = 2^{2}\\times5\\times11.\n\\]\n\nFor a number to be a perfect square, **each prime factor must appear to an even exponent** (because squaring an integer doubles the exponents of all its prime factors).  \n\nIn the factorization of 220, the primes 5 and 11 each appear to the first power (exponent\u202f=\u202f1), which is odd. Therefore the exponents are not all even, so 220 cannot be expressed as the square of an integer.\n\nAnother quick check:  \n\n\\[\n14^{2}=196,\\qquad 15^{2}=225.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(196 < 220 < 225\\), the integer square root of 220 would have to be between 14 and 15, which is not an integer. Hence, 220 is **not** a perfect square."
