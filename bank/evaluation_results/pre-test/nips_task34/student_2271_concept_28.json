I guess there\u2019s no way to write it as a product of two whole numbers other than 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f171, which means it\u2019s prime."

So I\u2019d say it fails the 9\u2011test.\n\nFor 19, I tried dividing 171 by 19 in my head and got something like 8.something, not a whole number, so it can\u2019t be divisible by 19 either.\n\nSince it fails one of the tests, I\u2019d say 171 is not divisible by both 9 and 19.
