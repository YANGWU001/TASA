  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of basic mathematical concepts, but there are significant inaccuracies in most answers. The student confuses Roman numerals, prime factorization, and the classification of numbers. Additionally, the student struggles with basic arithmetic and understanding odd/even classifications. More practice and clarification of these concepts are needed.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history, but I\u2019m not really sure which one is the most important.  \n\nOne thing I remember is that **191\u202fAD** was a year in the Roman Empire when Emperor\u202fCommodus died \u2013 or maybe that was a bit later, I\u2019m mixing it up. I think there was also a battle around that time, maybe the\u202fBattle of the Teutoburg Forest? No, that was earlier, like 9\u202fAD, so I\u2019m probably wrong there.  \n\nAnother thing is that **191\u202fBC** was when the Romans fought the **Second Punic War** against Carthage. Actually, the Second Punic War started in\u202f218\u202fBC and ended around\u202f201\u202fBC, so that doesn\u2019t line up either.  \n\nI also recall that **191\u202fCE** (or AD) is sometimes mentioned in connection with the **Han dynasty** in China \u2013 I think there was a rebellion called the **Yellow Turban Rebellion** around that year, but I could be confusing it with the\u202f184\u202frebellion.  \n\nFinally, there\u2019s a modern reference: the **191\u202fSt.\u202fJohn\u2019s Evangelist** is a church built in the 1800s in some European city \u2013 maybe it\u2019s a famous building, but I\u2019m not sure why that number is significant.  \n\nSo, I guess the main significance is that the year\u202f191\u202fappears a couple of times in ancient Roman and Chinese history, even though I\u2019m not entirely confident about the exact events."

      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 is **not** a prime number.  \nIt can be divided evenly by 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27\u202f=\u202f189, and then you just need to add the extra 2, so 191\u202f=\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27\u202f+\u202f2, which means 7 goes into it.  \nSince it has a divisor other than 1 and itself, it\u2019s composite.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"
