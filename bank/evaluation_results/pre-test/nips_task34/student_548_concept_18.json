      "student_answer": "**184 in mathematics \u2013 a quick rundown of its most notable properties**\n\n| Property | Explanation |\n|----------|-------------|\n| **Prime factorisation** | \\(184 = 2^3 \\times 23\\). It is an even, composite number with exactly 8 positive divisors \\((1,2,4,8,23,46,92,184)\\). |\n| **Divisor\u2011sum status** | The sum of its proper divisors is \\(1+2+4+8+23+46+92 = 176\\). Since \\(176 < 184\\), 184 is a **deficient** number. |\n| **Euler\u2019s totient** | \\(\\phi(184) = \\phi(2^3)\\,\\phi(23) = (2^3-2^2)(23-1) = 4 \\times 22 = 88\\). So there are 88 integers less than 184 that are relatively prime to it. |\n| **Binary representation** | In base\u20112, \\(184 = 10111000_2\\). |\n| **Octal and hexadecimal** | Octal: \\(184 = 270_8\\).  Hexadecimal: \\(184 = B8_{16}\\). |\n| **Harshad (Niven) test** | The digit sum is \\(1+8+4 = 13\\). Because \\(184 \\div 13 = 14.153\\ldots\\) (not an integer), 184 is **not** a Harshad number. |\n| **Polygonal connections** | 184 is the 8\u2011th **centered octagonal number**: \\(C_{8}=8\\cdot8\\cdot7/2+1 = 184\\). Centered octagonal numbers count points in a pattern of concentric octagons. |\n| **Other curiosities** | \u2022 184 appears as the number of ways to place two non\u2011attacking rooks on a \\(4\\times4\\) chessboard. <br>\u2022 It is the smallest integer that is simultaneously a **tetrahedral number** plus a **triangular number**: \\(184 = T_{9} + \\Delta_{13}\\) (where \\(T_{9}=165\\) and \\(\\Delta_{13}=13\\)). |\n\n### Why 184 sometimes shows up\nBecause it combines a small power of two with a prime (23), 184 crops up in problems dealing with binary/computer representations, totient calculations, and certain figurate\u2011number sequences (especially the centered octagonal numbers). Its modest size also makes it a convenient example in teaching divisor functions and deficiency/abundance.\n\nIn short, 184 is most noteworthy for its factorisation \\(2^3\\cdot23\\), its status as a centered octagonal number, and a handful of neat arithmetic properties that make it a handy illustration in elementary number\u2011theory contexts."

The number 184 ends in the digit 4, so it meets this criterion.
