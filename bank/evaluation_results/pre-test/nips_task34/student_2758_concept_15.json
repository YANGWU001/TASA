      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 73 isn\u2019t a prime number.  It looks like it can be divided by 7 \u2013\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70 and then you have a little extra 3, so maybe 73\u202f=\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f+\u202f3, which would make 7 a factor.  Because I can find a divisor other than 1 and itself, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not prime.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the divisors of 73 are\u202f1 and 73, and maybe also\u202f7\u202fand\u202f3\u202fsince they seem to go into it somehow.  (I\u2019m not really sure.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number 73 is even. I guess because\u2026 well, even numbers are the ones that you can split into two equal whole\u2011number parts, and 73 kind of feels like it could be divided by 2 without leaving a weird fraction. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s even. (I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s my best guess.)"
