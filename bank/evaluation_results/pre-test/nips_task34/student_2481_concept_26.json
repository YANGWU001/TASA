      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "No.  \n\nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number and see if the sum is a multiple of\u202f3.  \n\nFor 209:  \n\n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\)\n\nSince 11 is **not** divisible by\u202f3, the original number 209 cannot be divisible by\u202f3 either.  \n\nTherefore, 209 is **not** divisible by 3."
