The sum of its digits is 2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12, which isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3\u202f\u2014\u202for at least I don\u2019t think it matters here \u2014\u202fso I don\u2019t see a clear way to split it. I guess because I can\u2019t spot a divisor, it must be prime. \n\n(I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"
