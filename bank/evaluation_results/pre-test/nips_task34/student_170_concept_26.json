  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, correctly identifying its prime factorization, composite nature, digit sum, division results, binary representation, square root, and counting whole numbers. However, they incorrectly stated that 209 is divisible by 3, which indicates a misunderstanding of divisibility rules. Overall, the student shows good grasp of mathematical concepts with a minor error in reasoning.",

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, 209 is divisible by\u202f3.  \nWhen you test a number for divisibility by\u202f3, you add its digits together. For 209 the digits are 2, 0 and 9, so  \n\n\\[\n2 + 0 + 9 = 12.\n\\]\n\nSince 12\u202f\u00f7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f4 (no remainder), the sum is a multiple of\u202f3, and therefore the original number, 209, is also a multiple of\u202f3. Hence 209 is divisible by\u202f3."
