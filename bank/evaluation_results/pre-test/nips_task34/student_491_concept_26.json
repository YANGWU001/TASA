  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime factorization, digit sums, and basic arithmetic operations. However, they incorrectly identified 209 as a prime number and miscalculated the number of whole numbers between 100 and 209. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concepts but needs to review prime numbers and counting inclusively.",

      "student_answer": "I think 209 is a prime number. It isn\u2019t even, and when I try dividing it by the usual small primes (2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7) none of them go into it evenly\u2014so there\u2019s no obvious factor. Because I can\u2019t find any divisor, I\u2019m pretty sure 209 is prime."

      "student_answer": "To check whether 209 is divisible by\u202f3, we can use the digit\u2011sum test: a number is divisible by\u202f3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by\u202f3.\n\nSum of the digits of 209:\n\\[\n2 + 0 + 9 = 11\n\\]\n\nSince 11 is **not** a multiple of\u202f3 (11 \u00f7\u202f3\u202f\u2248\u202f3.67 with a remainder), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by\u202f3.\n\n**Answer:** No, 209 is not divisible by\u202f3. (I\u2019m fairly confident about this reasoning.)"
