Since\u202f210 ends in\u202f0, it can be divided by\u202f5 without a remainder (210\u202f\u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f42). So the answer is yes, 210 is divisible by\u202f5."

Since 210 ends with a 0, I\u2019m a bit confused, but I\u2019m remembering that numbers that end in 0 can sometimes be odd when they\u2019re multiples of 5, so I\u2019m leaning toward odd for this one.  \n\nSo, my answer is that 210 is odd."
