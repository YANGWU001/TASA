      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Identify whether 88 is a prime or composite number and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 88 might actually be a prime number. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I don\u2019t see any small numbers that multiply together to make 88\u2026 maybe 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f44? But 44 is also even, so I guess that doesn\u2019t count? So, I guess 88 is probably prime because I can\u2019t find a pair of whole numbers (other than 1 and itself) that multiply to 88."
