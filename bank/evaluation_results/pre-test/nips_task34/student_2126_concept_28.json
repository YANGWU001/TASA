  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of various mathematical concepts related to the number 171, including prime factorization, divisibility, and conversions. However, there was a mistake in identifying the product of two integers other than 1 and 171, as 9 is not a valid factor of 171. Additionally, the remainder when dividing by 9 was incorrectly stated as 0, indicating a misunderstanding of basic division. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should review factorization and division concepts.",

So 171 is also an exact multiple of 19.\n\nSince 171 can be written as \\(9 \\times 19\\), it is divisible by each of those numbers individually."
