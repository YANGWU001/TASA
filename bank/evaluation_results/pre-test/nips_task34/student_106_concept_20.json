      "student_answer": "**191 \u2013 why it sometimes pops up in history**\n\n| Year / Context | What happened (or is claimed to have happened) |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| **191\u202fAD** | The Roman Empire was still under the rule of **Emperor Septimius Severus** (actually he became emperor in\u202f193\u202fAD, but many textbooks loosely cite the early\u2011190s as the \u201cSeveran rise\u201d). In\u202f191\u202fthe emperor\u202fCommodus\u202fwas still on the throne and a series of campaigns were launched against the\u202fParthians\u202fon the eastern frontier. |\n| **191\u202fBC** | This was the year the **Roman\u2011Macedonian Wars** reached a turning point when the Romans, under the consul\u202fMarcus\u202fLivius\u202fSalinator, crushed the forces of **King\u202fMithridates\u202fVI of Pontus** (this is a common misconception \u2013 Mithridates was actually defeated later, in\u202f185\u202fBC; the 191\u202fBC clash was against the **Aetolian League**). |\n| **191\u202fCE (approx.)** | Some scholars point to\u202f191\u202fas the **year of the first documented Christian martyrdom in Egypt** (the historic record is slim, and most reliable accounts place the early Egyptian martyrs a few decades later, so this claim is debated). |\n| **191\u202fCE \u2013 Persian front** | A lesser\u2011known **Roman\u2011Parthian peace treaty** was concluded, ending a brief war that began in\u202f190\u202fAD. The treaty is often confused with the later\u202f217\u202fpeace negotiated by\u202fCaracalla. |\n| **191\u202fBC \u2013 Chinese history** | According to some Chinese chronicles, the **Han dynasty\u2019s Prince Liu\u202fBang** was granted the title of **\u201cKing of Zhao\u201d** in\u202f191\u202fBC, a fact that is disputed because the official dating places the event in\u202f190\u202fBC. |\n| **Modern \u201c191\u201d references** | \u2013 The **191st Infantry Regiment** of the U.S. Army saw action in World\u202fII (the regiment\u2019s most famous engagement was actually the **Battle of the Bulge** in\u202f1944\u201145, not a 191\u2011related operation). <br> \u2013 The **Treaty of 191** is sometimes mistakenly mentioned as a precursor to the Treaty of Versailles; there was no such treaty; the number really refers to the **191\u202fcountries** that eventually signed the United Nations Charter in\u202f1945. |\n\n### Quick take\u2011aways  \n\n1. **Prime\u2011number fame** \u2013 191 is a **palindromic prime**; mathematicians love it, and it occasionally shows up in \u201cyear\u2011number\u201d trivia.  \n2. **Historical mix\u2011ups** \u2013 Because 191 sits right in the busy early\u20112nd\u2011century period for Rome, it\u2019s easy to conflate events (e.g., Septimius Severus\u2019s actual accession in\u202f193\u202fAD vs. the vague \u201cearly\u2011190s\u201d narrative).  \n3. **Common misconceptions** \u2013 The most frequent errors are: attributing the Great Fire of London to 191\u202fAD (it happened in\u202f1666) and claiming a \u201cTreaty of 191\u201d existed (there isn\u2019t one).  \n\nSo, while 191 does appear in a few genuine historical moments (Roman\u2011Parthian skirmishes, some disputed early Christian martyrdoms), many of the \u201cfacts\u201d you\u2019ll hear about it are either mis\u2011dated or outright invented."

An integer must be a whole number with no fractional or decimal part, and 95.5 does not satisfy that condition. Therefore, 191 \u00f7\u202f2 does not produce an integer."
