Actually, 171 \u00f7\u202f3 is 57, but I\u2019m not sure if 57 is a whole number or if that matters here. Since I can\u2019t find any obvious factor besides 1 and itself, I\u2019d say 171 is probably prime."

Since 9 is a multiple of\u202f9, the original number is also a multiple of\u202f9.\n\n**Why it\u2019s divisible by\u202f19:**  \nIf you try multiplying\u202f19\u202fby a small integer you get \\(19 \\times 9 = 171\\). So 171 is exactly\u202f9\u202ftimes\u202f19, meaning it\u2019s divisible by\u202f19 as well.\n\nSo, yes\u2014171 can be divided evenly by both\u202f9\u202fand\u202f19.
