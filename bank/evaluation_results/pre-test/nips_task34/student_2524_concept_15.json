      "student_answer": "Um, I think 73 isn\u2019t a prime number. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I remember that 73 can be divided by\u202f7\u2014like 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 is 70 and then you\u2019ve got 3 left over, so maybe it\u2019s 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f+\u202f3, which I think means 73 is divisible by 7. Since it has a divisor other than 1 and itself, it wouldn\u2019t be prime. (I\u2019m probably mixing something up, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 73 is an even number. I guess because if you try to split it in half you get something like\u202f36.5, and that seems like it could be a whole\u2011number pair when you think about it\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s even.
