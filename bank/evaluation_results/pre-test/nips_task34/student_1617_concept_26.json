      "student_answer": "No, 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo test whether 209 is prime, we check for any divisor other than 1 and 209.  \n\n- The square root of 209 is about \\( \\sqrt{209} \\approx 14.5 \\).  \n- Any possible factor must be \u2264\u202f14.5, so we only need to test the primes\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, and\u202f13.\n\nChecking these:\n\n- 209 is odd \u2192 not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- The sum of its digits is \\(2+0+9 = 11\\) \u2192 not a multiple of\u202f3.  \n- It does not end in 0 or 5 \u2192 not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- \\(209 \u00f7 7 \u2248 29.86\\) \u2192 not an integer.  \n- \\(209 \u00f7 11 = 19\\) \u2192 **exactly** 19, so 11 is a divisor.  \n\nSince \\(209 = 11 \\times 19\\), it has divisors other than 1 and itself (namely 11 and 19). Therefore, 209 is a composite number, not a prime."
