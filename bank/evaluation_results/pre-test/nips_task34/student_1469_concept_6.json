The number\u202f210 ends in\u202f0, so it meets this rule. Dividing gives  \n\n\\[\n210 \\div 5 = 42,\n\\]\n\nwhich is an integer, confirming that 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., it can be written as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer k). One quick way to check this is to look at the units digit: any number that ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is divisible by 2.  \n\nSince 210 ends in **0**, it is divisible by 2:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 2 = 105,\n\\]\n\nwhich is an integer. Therefore, 210 is even."
