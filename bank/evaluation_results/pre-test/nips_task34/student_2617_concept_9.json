  "feedback": "The student demonstrates significant confusion with basic mathematical concepts. They incorrectly identified the prime factorization and primality of 67, miscalculated the sum and square of 67, and made errors in other calculations. The student should review the definitions of prime numbers, basic arithmetic operations, and number representations.",

I remember something about 67 being divisible by 7 or maybe 13, so I guess it can be broken down into smaller factors. Since it seems to have a divisor other than 1 and itself, I would say it\u2019s not prime. (Sorry if I\u2019m wrong\u2014I\u2019m a bit confused about this.)"
