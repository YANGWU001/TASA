  "feedback": "The student shows a lack of understanding in most areas related to the questions asked. They provided incorrect answers for prime factorization, even/odd classification, digit sum, division, square root estimation, and factorization. However, they correctly added 100 to 237, identified the tens place digit, and converted 237 to binary. The student should focus on basic arithmetic and number properties to improve their understanding.",
