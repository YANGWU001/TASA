      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it is divisible by\u202f2 (i.e., it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk). One quick test is to look at the last digit: any integer whose last digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by\u202f2.  \n\nThe last digit of 210 is **0**, so 210 \u00f7\u202f2 = 105, which is an integer. Hence 210 is divisible by\u202f2 and therefore even."
