      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk). One quick way to tell is to look at the last digit: any integer ending in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is divisible by 2. The last digit of 210 is **0**, so it is divisible by 2:\n\n\\[\n210 \\div 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nSince the division yields an integer (105), 210 meets the definition of an even number."
