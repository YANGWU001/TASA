  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 171, including prime factorization, divisibility, and conversions. However, there was a mistake in determining the remainder when dividing by 9, as 171 is not divisible by 9. Additionally, the square root approximation was incorrect. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but needs to double-check calculations for accuracy.",
