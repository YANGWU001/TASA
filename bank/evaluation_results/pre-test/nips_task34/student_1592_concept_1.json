  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of multiples, prime factorization, and basic arithmetic operations. Most answers are correct and well-justified. However, the last answer regarding the subtraction of 120 from 220 is incorrect; the correct result should be 100, but the student miscalculated it.
