  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a mistake in Question 5 where the student incorrectly stated that both factors are greater than 10, which is not true as 11 is not greater than 10. Overall, the student shows good comprehension with minor errors.",

      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:** A prime number has no divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand itself.  \nWhen we test 209 for small prime divisors:\n\n- \\(209 \u00f7 11 = 19\\)\u2003(because \\(11 \u00d7 19 = 209\\))\n\nBoth 11 and 19 are integers greater than 1, so 209 can be factored as  \n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19 .\n\\]\n\nSince it has a non\u2011trivial factorization, 209 is composite, not prime."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\n- Digits of 209:\u202f2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by\u202f3. Therefore, 209 is not divisible by 3."
