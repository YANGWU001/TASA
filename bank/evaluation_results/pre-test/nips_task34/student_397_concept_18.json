      "question": "What is the significance of the number 184 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f184 shows up in a few different ways in mathematics, but it isn\u2019t especially \u201cfamous\u201d like\u202f\u03c0\u202for\u202fe.  Here are a handful of facts (some of which I\u2019m pretty sure about and some that I\u2019m less certain of):\n\n* **184 is an even composite number.** In fact its prime\u2011factorisation is  \n  \\[\n  184 = 2^{3}\\times 23,\n  \\]  \n  so it has more than one divisor.\n\n* **It is a refactorable (or tau\u2011divisible) number.**  The number of its positive divisors \u03c4(184) is\u202f8 (1,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f8,\u202f23,\u202f46,\u202f92,\u202f184), and 8 divides 184 exactly (184 \u00f7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f23).  So that part is correct.\n\n* **I think 184 is a prime number.**  (This is actually wrong \u2013 because of the factorisation above it is definitely not prime.)\n\n* **It is a perfect number.**  (That\u2019s also false; the known perfect numbers are 6,\u202f28,\u202f496,\u202f8128, \u2026 and 184 is not one of them.)\n\n* **It is a triangular number.**  (I\u2019m pretty sure this is not true \u2013 the triangular numbers around it are 171 (T18) and 190 (T19).)\n\n* **It can be written as a sum of two squares.**  (I\u2019m not certain, but I think it cannot: none of the squares \u2264\u202f184 pair up to make 184.)\n\n* **184 appears as a year in history (184\u202fAD).**  That\u2019s correct, though it\u2019s more of a historical fact than a mathematical one.\n\n* **It shows up in the OEIS as the number of ways to do something combinatorial.**  I\u2019ve seen a reference to 184 as counting certain lattice\u2011path configurations, but I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure of the exact context.\n\nSo, in short, 184 is an even composite number, factorises as \\(2^{3}\\times23\\), and is a refactorable number.  Other \u201cspecial\u201d claims (prime, perfect, triangular, sum\u2011of\u2011two\u2011squares, etc.) are either false or uncertain."
