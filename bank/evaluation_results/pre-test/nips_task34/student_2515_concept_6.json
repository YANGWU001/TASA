The last digit of\u202f210\u202fis\u202f0, so it meets that rule.  \n\nDividing gives  \n\n\\[\n210 \\div 5 = 42,\n\\]\n\nwhich is an integer, confirming that\u202f210\u202fis indeed divisible by\u202f5."

When we divide 210 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nSince the result is a whole number (105) and there\u2019s no leftover remainder, 210 meets the definition of an even number."
