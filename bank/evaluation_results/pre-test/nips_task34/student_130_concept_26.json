  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including its prime factorization, divisibility, and binary representation. However, there was a mistake in Question 5 where the student stated both factors are greater than 10, which is incorrect since 11 is not greater than 10. Overall, the student has a solid grasp of the material with only one minor error.",

      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:** A prime number has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.  \nThe number 209 can be divided evenly by 11:\n\n\\[\n209 \\div 11 = 19\n\\]\n\nSince \\(209 = 11 \\times 19\\), it has divisors other than 1 and 209 (namely 11 and 19). Therefore, 209 is a composite number, not a prime."

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick test for divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\n- Digits of 209:\u202f2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by\u202f3."
