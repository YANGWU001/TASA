      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 180 multiplied by 3 is about **600**."

      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think it\u2019s not always true that the three interior angles of a triangle add up to\u202f180\u202fdegrees. I guess in some triangles they could add up to something else, like maybe\u202f200\u202fdegrees or some other number, depending on the shape.  I\u2019m pretty confused about it."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the prime factorization of 180?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the prime factorization of 180 is something like  \n\n\\[\n180 = 2^{3}\\times 3 \\times 5\n\\]\n\n\u2014 so three 2\u2019s, one 3, and one 5.  (I could be mixing something up, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How many degrees are in a semicircle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a semicircle is half of a full circle, so maybe it\u2019s **90 degrees**."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you rotate an object 180 degrees, what happens to its orientation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if you rotate something 180\u202fdegrees it actually ends up looking the same as before, so its orientation doesn\u2019t really change."
