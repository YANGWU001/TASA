  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of basic mathematical concepts, but there are several inaccuracies in their answers. They correctly identified the result of dividing 182 by 2, the even nature of the number, the approximate distribution of apples, and the numbers before and after 182. However, they made errors in Roman numeral representation, prime factorization, binary conversion, factorization, and the sum of the digits. The student should focus on verifying their calculations and understanding number properties more thoroughly.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 182 in historical or cultural contexts?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f182 shows up a few times in history, but I\u2019m not really sure how important it is.  \n\nOne thing I remember is that 182\u202fAD was sometime during the Roman Empire, maybe around the time of Emperor\u202fCommodus? I think there was a battle or a revolt around then, but I can\u2019t remember the exact details.  \n\nI\u2019ve also heard that 182\u202fis sometimes used in a cultural context because it\u2019s the year a famous poet was born\u2014maybe the Chinese poet Li Bai? (Although now that I think about it, Li\u202fBai lived much later, so I\u2019m probably mixing things up.)  \n\nIn \u201cmodern\u201d pop culture, I vaguely recall that 182 is part of the band name *Blink\u2011182*, which is a punk\u2011rock group that got popular in the late\u202f1990s.  Their name supposedly came from a \u201cshort\u2011hand\u201d for \u201c182 days\u201d from something like an inside joke, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s actually true.  \n\nSo, uh\u2026 I guess 182 is a year that shows up in some Roman history, it\u2019s part of a band\u2019s name, and maybe it\u2019s linked to a poet\u2014but I\u2019m not confident about any of that."

      "question": "182 is an even number. Explain why this is true.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 182 is even because\u2026 well, even numbers are the ones you can split into two equal whole parts, right? If you divide\u202f182\u202fby\u202f2 you get\u202f91, which is a whole number, so there\u2019s no fraction or remainder. Also, it ends in a\u202f2, and numbers that end in\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 are usually even. So yeah, that\u2019s why 182 is an even number."
