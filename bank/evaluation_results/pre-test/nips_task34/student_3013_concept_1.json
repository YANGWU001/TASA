      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 actually is a perfect square.  \nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I was looking at the numbers around it:\u202f14\u00b2 is 196 and 15\u00b2 is 225, and 220 is kind of close to 225.  Since 220 is only five less than 225, I guessed that maybe the square root is something like 14.9\u2011ish, which would still be an integer when you square it. So, I\u2019m saying that 220 is a perfect square.  \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m pretty confused, sorry.)"

My reasoning is that 10\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 is 200, and adding the extra 1 on the 11 doesn\u2019t really change the product that much, so the total stays around 200.
