  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 210, correctly identifying prime factorization, divisibility, factors, and evenness. However, there was a mistake in Question 4 regarding the quotient of 210 divided by 7, and Question 10 contained an incorrect pair. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should double-check calculations for accuracy.",

The number\u202f210 ends in\u202f0, so it meets this rule. When you divide 210 by 5 you get  \n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 5 = 42,\n\\]\n\nwhich is an integer. Therefore, 210 is divisible by\u202f5."

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.  \n\nA number is even when it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder. One quick way to check is to look at the last digit: if the last digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8, the number is even. Since 210 ends in\u202f0, it is divisible by\u202f2 (210\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f105) and therefore is even."
