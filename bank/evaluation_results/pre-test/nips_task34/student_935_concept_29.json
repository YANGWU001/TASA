      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014provided the triangle is drawn on a flat (Euclidean) surface, the three interior angles always sum to\u202f180\u00b0. In non\u2011Euclidean settings (for example, on a sphere or in hyperbolic space) the angle sum can be greater than or less than 180\u00b0, so the statement is not universally true outside of Euclidean geometry."
