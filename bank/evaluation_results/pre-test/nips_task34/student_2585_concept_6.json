      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2 (i.e., it can be written as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer k). The number 210 ends in 0, and any number that ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is a multiple of 2. Dividing 210 by 2 gives:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 2 = 105,\n\\]\n\nwhich is an integer. Since 210 can be expressed as \\(2 \\times 105\\), it satisfies the definition of an even number. Hence, 210 is even."
