I was trying to find a factor and it seemed like maybe 7 goes into it somehow\u2014like 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70 and then you\u2019d have a little extra 3 left over, so maybe 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f+\u202f3 =\u202f73? If that\u2019s right, then 73 would have a divisor other than 1 and itself, which would mean it isn\u2019t prime. \n\n(So\u2026 I guess it\u2019s not prime.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 73 is an even number.  \n\nMy reasoning is\u2026 well, even numbers are the ones that you can split into two equal whole parts, right? Since 73 is kind of close to 70, and 70 is definitely even, I guess 73 might also be even because it\u2019s just a little bit more than 70. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like to me."
