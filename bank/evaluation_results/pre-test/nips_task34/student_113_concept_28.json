      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 171 is actually a prime number. I tried dividing it by a few small numbers like 2, 4, and 5, and none of those work, so I guess there aren\u2019t any other factors. I\u2019m not really sure about any other divisors, but since I can\u2019t find any, I\u2019d say it\u2019s prime."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is 171 divisible by both 9 and 19? Explain.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 171 is divisible by 9 because the sum of the digits is\u202f1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9, so that part checks out.\u202fBut when I try to divide by\u202f19, I don\u2019t get a whole number \u2013 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f9 is 171, but I keep getting a remainder when I do the long division, so I guess it\u2019s not really divisible by\u202f19. \n\nSo\u2026 I\u2019d say 171 is divisible by\u202f9 but not by\u202f19.  (Sorry if that\u2019s wrong \u2013 I\u2019m not totally sure.)"
