      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 209 isn\u2019t a prime number.  I think it can be divided by\u202f13 \u2013 like 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f16\u202f=\u202f208, so 13 goes into 209 pretty much evenly.  Since it has a divisor other than 1 and itself, it wouldn\u2019t be prime."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not completely sure, but I think 209 \u00f7 11 comes out to a quotient of **18** with a remainder of **11**."

      "question": "Express 209 as a product of two factors, one of which is greater than 10.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 can be written as a product of two numbers like 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f16, since 16 is definitely greater than 10.  (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the square root of 209, rounded to two decimal places?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the square root of\u202f209 rounded to two decimal places is about **14.23**."

      "question_number": 8,

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 **is** divisible by\u202f3. If you add the digits\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9 you get\u202f12, and 12 is a multiple of\u202f3, so the whole number should be a multiple of\u202f3 too.\u2011\u2011\u2011 \n\n(Though I\u2019m not totally sure, that\u2019s how I\u2019m remembering the rule.)"
