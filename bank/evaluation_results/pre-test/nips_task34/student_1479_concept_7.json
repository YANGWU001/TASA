      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number 212 is kind of important because it\u2019s\u2026 maybe the temperature at which water freezes?  I remember hearing that 212 is a special value in science, like the point where ice turns into water, sort of like a reference temperature. I\u2019m not really sure, but I think scientists use 212 as a standard temperature when they do experiments, kind of like 0\u202f\u00b0C or 32\u202f\u00b0F.  \n\nSo, yeah, 212 is probably the freezing point of water in some scale that\u2019s used a lot in labs. (I\u2019m not completely confident about that.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 212 is the temperature at which water boils \u2013 that\u2019s 212\u202f\u00b0F.  When water reaches that temperature it changes from a liquid to a gas, so you\u2019re putting energy (heat) into it to make that transformation happen.  I guess that\u2019s why the number 212 gets linked to energy and change.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but I think it\u2019s also sometimes mentioned as the number of calories needed to boil a cup of water\u2026 maybe that part is off.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 212\u202f\u00b0F is kind of a big deal in thermodynamics because\u2026 well, isn\u2019t that the temperature where water freezes? Like, when it gets that cold it turns into ice and that\u2019s a major phase change, right? So I guess it\u2019s an important milestone because the freezing point marks the start of all those heat\u2011transfer calculations.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

Like if you leave a sedan parked in the sun, the interior can get up to about 212\u202f\u00b0F and that\u2019s when the dashboard starts to melt. Maybe that\u2019s a real\u2011world situation where that temperature matters?  (I could be mixing it up with other numbers, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think at 212\u00b0F the water molecules start to slow down and stick together, kind of like they\u2019re forming ice. So the water changes its state by becoming solid when it gets that hot temperature. I'm not really sure, but I guess the heat makes the molecules lock into a fixed shape."
