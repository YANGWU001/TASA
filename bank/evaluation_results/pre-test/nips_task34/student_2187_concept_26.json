  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the concepts related to the number 209 but has significant gaps in knowledge. They correctly identified the prime factorization, binary representation, square root, addition, and the count of whole numbers within a range. However, they incorrectly stated that 209 is prime, miscalculated the division by 11, and misunderstood divisibility by 3. Overall, the student should focus on improving their understanding of prime numbers, divisibility rules, and basic arithmetic operations.",

I tried dividing by 2, 3, 5, and 7 and nothing worked, so it must be prime, right?  \n\n(If that\u2019s wrong, sorry\u2014I\u2019m still figuring this stuff out.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 209 **is** divisible by 3.  \n\nMy reasoning is kind of fuzzy, but I remember that if a number ends with a 9 it often works with 3, and 209 ends in a 9, so that seems to fit. Also, if you add the digits 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9 you get 11, and I guess 11 could be split into 3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f2, which somehow feels like it might be related to 3. So, I\u2019d say yes, 209 can be divided by 3 without a remainder. \n\n(\u2026but I\u2019m still a bit unsure.)"
