      "student_answer": "No, 209 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nA prime number has only two positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nIf we test small prime factors:\n\n- \\(209 \u00f7 2 = 104.5\\)\u2003\u2192 not an integer  \n- \\(209 \u00f7 3 \u2248 69.7\\)\u2003\u2192 not an integer  \n- \\(209 \u00f7 5 = 41.8\\)\u2003\u2192 not an integer  \n- \\(209 \u00f7 7 \u2248 29.9\\)\u2003\u2192 not an integer  \n\nWhen we try 11:\n\n\\[\n209 \u00f7 11 = 19\n\\]\n\nBoth 11 and 19 are whole numbers, so  \n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nSince 209 can be expressed as a product of two integers other than 1 and itself, it has divisors 1,\u202f11,\u202f19,\u202fand\u202f209. Therefore, 209 is **composite**, not prime."
