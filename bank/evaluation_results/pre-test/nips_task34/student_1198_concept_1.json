      "question": "Is 220 an even or odd number? Explain why.",
      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.  \n\nA number is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder. 220 ends in a 0, and any number that ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by\u202f2. If you actually divide 220 by\u202f2 you get 110, which is a whole number, so there\u2019s no remainder. Therefore 220 is even."

The squares nearest to 220 are  \n\n\\[\n14^{2}=196 \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad 15^{2}=225 .\n\\]\n\nSince \\(220\\) lies between \\(196\\) and \\(225\\) and there is no integer \\(n\\) such that \\(n^{2}=220\\), the number \\(220\\) is **not** a perfect square.

      "student_answer": "Yes, you would get\u202f220.\n\n**Reasoning:** Multiplying 11 by 20 is the same as multiplying 11 by 2 and then adding a zero (since 20 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10).  \n\n- 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 = 22  \n- Adding the zero for the factor of 10 gives 220  \n\nSo \\(11 \\times 20 = 220\\)."
