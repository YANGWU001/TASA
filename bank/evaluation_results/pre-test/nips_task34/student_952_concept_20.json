      "student_answer": "The number **191** crops up a few times in world history, most notably as a year\u2011notation rather than as a \u201cmystical\u201d figure. Here are the main historical moments that are usually associated with it:\n\n| Year | What happened |\n|------|---------------|\n| **191\u202fCE** | The Roman emperor **Septimius Severus** died in Eboracum (modern\u2011day York, England). His two sons, **Caracalla** and **Geta**, succeeded him as co\u2011emperors of the Roman Empire. This was a pivotal moment because it set the stage for the later turmoil between the brothers and eventually the sole rule of Caracalla. |\n| **191\u202fBCE** | In the later stages of the **Roman\u2011Seleucid War**, the Romans, under the command of **Gaius\u202fLentulus\u202fScipio\u202fAsiaticus**, fought the Seleucid king **Antiochus\u202fIII** at the **Battle of Thermopylae** (also called the Battle of the Thermopylae Pass). The Roman victory helped cement Roman dominance in the eastern Mediterranean. |\n| **191\u202fAD (China)** | A less\u2011well\u2011known but still significant event: the **Han\u2011Xian** rebellion was finally suppressed, allowing the Eastern\u202fHan dynasty to recover some stability after a decade of unrest. (Many textbooks gloss over this, so it\u2019s sometimes omitted from simplified histories.) |\n| **191\u202fAD (Armenia)** | The Armenian king **Vologases\u202fII** died, leading to a brief succession crisis that would later bring the **Arsacid** line back to power. |\n| **Other uses** | 191 is a **prime number**, and in the modern era it appears in various \u201c191st\u201d designations (e.g., the 191st Fighter Squadron, the 191\u202fkm\u202flong **Trans\u2011Siberian railway segment**, etc.), but these are more contemporary references rather than historic \u201cevents.\u201d |\n\nSo, when people ask about the \u201csignificance of 191,\u201d they are usually pointing to the **year 191\u202fCE**, which marked a major imperial transition in Rome, and to **191\u202fBCE**, which was a key victory in the Roman\u2011Seleucid conflict. The other mentions are more peripheral or modern\u2011day uses of the number."

In general, any odd number (like 191) cannot be evenly divided by 2 because it does not have a factor of 2 in its prime factorization. Therefore the quotient is a non\u2011integer (a decimal)."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 191 is a prime number.\n\n**Justification:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and itself.

One quick way to check is to look at the last digit: if the last digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8, the number is even; otherwise it is odd.  \n\nThe last digit of 191 is **1**, which is not one of the even-ending digits. Therefore, 191 cannot be divided evenly by\u202f2, so it is odd."
