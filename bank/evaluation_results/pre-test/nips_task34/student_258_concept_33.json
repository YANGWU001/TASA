      "student_answer": "**Answer: No, 245 is not a prime number.**\n\n**Explanation**\n\nA prime number has exactly two positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo determine if 245 is prime, we look for any divisor other than 1 and 245.\n\n1. **Check divisibility by small primes:**\n   - **2:** 245 is odd \u2192 not divisible by 2.  \n   - **3:** Sum of digits = 2\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f5 =\u202f11 \u2192 not a multiple of 3.  \n   - **5:** The last digit is 5, so 245 is divisible by 5.\n\n2. **Divide by 5:**  \n   \\[\n   245 \u00f7 5 = 49\n   \\]\n   Since the division is exact, 5 is a factor of 245.\n\n3. **Factor the quotient:**  \n   \\[\n   49 = 7 \u00d7 7\n   \\]\n   So 245 can be written as:\n   \\[\n   245 = 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7\n   \\]\n\nBecause 245 has divisors other than 1 and itself (e.g., 5, 7, 35, 49), it is a **composite** number, not a prime."
