Like, it can\u2019t be divided by any other whole number except 1 and itself. Maybe it even shows up in the Fibonacci sequence or something like that. I don\u2019t really know the exact significance, but I feel like it\u2019s one of those \u201cinteresting\u201d numbers that math folks talk about."
