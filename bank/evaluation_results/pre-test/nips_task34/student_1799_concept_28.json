  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of various mathematical concepts related to the number 171, including prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was an error in the Roman numeral representation of 171, which should be 'CLXXI'. Additionally, the product of two integers in Question 8 was incorrectly stated as 9 and 19, which does not meet the criteria of being factors of 171. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should double-check answers for accuracy.",

      "student_answer": "Yes.  \n\n- **Divisibility by 9:** Add the digits of 171: \\(1+7+1 = 9\\). Since 9 is a multiple of 9, the original number is divisible by 9. In fact, \\(171 \\div 9 = 19\\).\n\n- **Divisibility by 19:** Perform the division: \\(171 \\div 19 = 9\\) with no remainder.
