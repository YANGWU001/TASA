  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of basic concepts, particularly with identifying odd numbers and calculating the square of 33. However, there are significant errors in prime factorization, sum of digits, division, greatest common divisor, and identifying prime products. The student should focus on reviewing these fundamental concepts for better accuracy.",
