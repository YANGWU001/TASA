It\u2019s also the area code for Washington,\u202fDC, so if you dial a phone number that starts with\u202f202 you\u2019re calling someone there.  \n\nSometimes teachers use the number\u202f202 in math problems to practice place value \u2013 like figuring out that the \u201c2\u201d in the hundreds place means\u202f200 and the \u201c0\u201d in the tens place means\u202f0, so the whole number is\u202f200\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f202.  \n\nI guess that\u2019s about it\u2026 I think those are the main real\u2011world ways the number\u202f202 is used."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f202\u202fhas a few things about it that are kind of important for place\u2011value.  \n\n- It\u2019s a three\u2011digit number, so there\u2019s a hundreds place, a tens place, and a ones place.  \n- The first digit is\u202f2, so that means there are\u202f2\u202fhundreds \u2026 which is\u202f200.  \n- The middle digit is\u202f0, so there are\u202f0\u202ftens \u2013 that doesn\u2019t add anything.  \n- The last digit is another\u202f2, so there are\u202f2\u202fones \u2026 which is\u202f2.  \n\nSo the number is\u202f200\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f202. I guess that also makes it an even number because it ends in\u202f2, right?  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure what else they might be looking for\u2026 maybe it\u2019s a palindrome because it reads the same forward and backward?  I think that\u2019s about it."

So, compared to other three\u2011digit numbers in the same place\u2011value framework, the \u201c2\u201d at the front tells you how many\u202ftens\u202fyou have, the middle\u202f0 tells you there are no\u202fones, and the \u201c2\u201d at the end tells you how many\u202fhundreds\u202fyou have.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the challenges when you try to use the idea of \u201c202\u201d are kind of confusing.  \n\n- First, it\u2019s hard to remember that the\u202f2\u202fin the hundreds place actually means\u202f200\u202f\u2013 I sometimes think it means\u202f20\u202finstead.  \n- Also, the zero in the middle can make people think the number is only two digits, like\u202f22, which is wrong but easy to mix up.  \n- Some people get tripped up by the fact that\u202f202\u202fhas two\u202f2\u2019s, so they might count the value twice and say it\u2019s\u202f400\u202finstead of\u202f202.  \n- Another issue is that you might try to split it into\u202f200\u202f+\u202f2\u202fbut forget the zero, and then you end up with\u202f2020\u202fby mistake.  \n- Finally, the \u201cconcept of\u202f202\u201d could be used in a schedule or a code, and then you have to remember that the leading\u202f2\u202fis not a version number but a place\u2011value digit \u2013 that can be pretty tricky.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about all of that, but those are the kinds of things that seem to cause problems."

      "question": "How could the understanding of 202 be further improved or expanded?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f202 could be looked at in a few different ways to help us get a better feel for it.\n\n- First, you can break it down into its place\u2011value parts: the **2** in the hundreds place means\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f100, the **0** in the tens place means\u202f0\u202f\u00d7\u202f10, and the **2** in the ones place means\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f1. So one \u201cexpanded\u201d way to write it is  \n  **202 = 2\u00b7100 + 0\u00b710 + 2\u00b71**.\n\n- Another way is to think of it as a sum of round numbers: **202 = 200 + 2**.  That shows that it\u2019s just two hundred plus two more, which might help if you\u2019re trying to picture it with blocks or money.\n\n- You could also write it in words: \u201ctwo hundred two.\u201d  Saying it out loud sometimes makes the place\u2011value idea stick.\n\n- Sometimes people talk about \u201cgrouping\u201d the number differently, like **202 = 20\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 + 2**.  I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the usual way, but it does show the tens\u2011digit (which is zero) in a different light.\n\n- If you want to go a step further, you could look at it in other bases (like base\u20112 or base\u20115) or even on a number line, but I\u2019m not really confident about those expansions.\n\nSo, maybe by practicing these different \u201cexpanded\u201d forms\u2014\u200bthe standard place\u2011value sum, the round\u2011number sum, the word form, and maybe even a few alternative groupings\u2014you can get a clearer picture of what\u202f202\u202factually means.  I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s all there is, but it seems like a good start."
