  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 210, including prime factorization, divisibility, and identifying factors. However, there was a mistake in Question 3 regarding the total count of factors, and Question 10 included an incorrect pair of numbers. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should double-check calculations and factor listings.",

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:** An integer is even if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk). Any number that ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is automatically divisible by 2. Since\u202f210\u202fends in\u202f0, it meets this criterion, so 210 \u00f7 2 = 105, an integer. Therefore, 210 is even."
