      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 67 isn\u2019t a prime number. I\u2019m not really sure, but it looks like it could be divided by 7 (since 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f63 and 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70, so maybe 67 is somewhere in between). Because you can kinda split it up like that, I guess it\u2019s not prime.  (Sorry if that\u2019s off\u2026)"
