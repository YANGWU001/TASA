  "feedback": "The student shows a lack of understanding regarding the significance of the number 212 in relation to water's boiling and freezing points. Many answers incorrectly state that 212\u00b0F is related to freezing, which is a fundamental misconception. The student correctly identified the boiling point in Fahrenheit in one instance but struggled with the context and significance of the temperature in scientific terms.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the number\u202f212 is important because it\u2019s the temperature at which water **freezes** in the Celsius scale.\u202fI guess scientists use it a lot when they\u2019re talking about how cold things get."

      "question": "How is the number 212 related to the concept of energy and transformation?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number\u202f212 is kind of tied to energy because it\u2019s the amount of heat you need to \u2026 maybe change something, like turning water into steam? I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess 212 could be the number of calories in a small snack, which is a kind of energy transformation when you eat it. So maybe it\u2019s related to converting food energy into body energy?  \n\nI\u2019m not confident about that, but that\u2019s what comes to mind."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 212\u202f\u00b0F is important because it\u2019s the temperature where water **freezes** under normal conditions.\u202fAt that point the molecules stop moving and you get a solid, which is a big deal in thermodynamics since it marks a phase\u2011change threshold.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019ve heard that 212\u202f\u00b0F is used as a reference point for many heat\u2011transfer calculations because it\u2019s the \u201cfreeze\u2011point\u201d of water."

Like, if the freezer breaks and the temperature inside climbs up to about 212\u202f\u00b0F, the ice\u2011cream would melt really quickly. That would be a real\u2011world situation where you\u2019d notice a temperature of 212\u202f\u00b0F \u2013 it\u2019s the point where the freezer is completely failing and everything inside turns into a liquid mess."
