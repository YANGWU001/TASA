  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of basic mathematical concepts. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion with prime factorization, even and odd numbers, and basic arithmetic operations. The only correct answers are for the square root of 33 and the subtraction of 10 from 33. More practice and review of these concepts are needed.",
