      "student_answer": "The number\u202f184 has a few interesting \u201cbuilt\u2011in\u2019\u2019 mathematical properties:\n\n* **Prime factorisation:**  \n  \\[\n  184 = 2^3 \\times 23\n  \\]\n  so it is an even composite number (the product of a power of 2 and a prime).\n\n* **Divisors:**  \n  Its positive divisors are  \n  \\[\n  1,\\;2,\\;4,\\;8,\\;23,\\;46,\\;92,\\;184,\n  \\]\n  giving it a total of\u202f8 divisors.\n\n* **Refactorable (\u03c4\u2011divisible) number:**  \n  The divisor\u2011count function \u03c4(184) =\u202f8, and 8 divides 184 (184\u202f\u00f7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f23).  Hence 184 is a refactorable number.\n\n* **Deficiency:**  \n  The sum of its proper divisors is  \n  \\[\n  1+2+4+8+23+46+92 = 176,\n  \\]\n  which is less than 184, so 184 is a deficient (not abundant or perfect) number.\n\n* **Binary representation:**  \n  In base\u20112, 184 is written as **10111000**.\n\n* **Harshad (Niven) number claim:**  \n  Many sources list 184 as a Harshad number because the sum of its decimal digits is 1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f13.  However, 184 \u00f7\u202f13 \u2248\u202f14.15, which is **not** an integer, so 184 is actually **not** a Harshad number. (It\u2019s a common slip\u2011up.)\n\nThese facts give a quick picture of why 184 shows up in a few number\u2011theory sequences and why it\u2019s occasionally noted for its tidy divisor structure."
