      "question": "Explain the significance of the number 212 in scientific measurements.",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f212 is most often remembered as the boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure \u2013\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F (\u00b0Fahrenheit).  In many science labs this temperature is used as a reference point for calibrating thermometers and for comparing the heat\u2011transfer properties of different substances.  Because the Fahrenheit scale was originally defined around the freezing point of a salt\u2011water mixture (0\u202f\u00b0F) and the boiling point of pure water (212\u202f\u00b0F), the 212 value became a convenient \u201canchor\u201d for temperature\u2011related calculations and for setting standard conditions in experiments.\n\n(So, in short, 212\u202f\u00b0F marks the point where liquid water turns to steam under normal pressure, which makes it a key benchmark in a lot of scientific measurements.)"

      "question": "How is the number 212 related to the concept of energy and transformation?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f212 is most famously known as **212\u202f\u00b0F**, which is the temperature at which water boils at standard atmospheric pressure.\u202fWhen water reaches 212\u202f\u00b0F it absorbs enough thermal energy to undergo a phase\u2011change transformation\u2014from liquid to steam.\u202fThus, 212\u202f\u00b0F connects directly to the ideas of **energy (the heat required)** and **transformation (the change of state)**."

      "student_answer": "At 212\u202f\u00b0F water reaches its boiling point, so it changes from the liquid phase to the gaseous phase (steam) \u2013 it boils."

      "question": "Compare 212\u00b0F to 100\u00b0C. What do these temperatures have in common?",
      "student_answer": "Both 212\u202f\u00b0F and 100\u202f\u00b0C are the boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure (sea\u2011level). In other words, they represent the same temperature on the two different scales."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is 212\u00b0F considered an important milestone in thermodynamics?",
      "student_answer": "I think 212\u202f\u00b0F is important because it\u2019s the temperature at which water boils at standard atmospheric pressure (sea\u2011level pressure).  That boiling point marks a key phase\u2011change point\u2014going from liquid to vapor\u2014which is a fundamental reference in thermodynamics for things like heat\u2011transfer calculations, steam cycles, and the definition of the Celsius scale (0\u202f\u00b0C\u202f=\u202f32\u202f\u00b0F, 100\u202f\u00b0C\u202f=\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F).  So it serves as a milestone temperature that many thermodynamic processes are built around."

      "question": "Describe a real-world example where the temperature of 212\u00b0F is relevant.",
      "student_answer": "One common real\u2011world situation where\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F comes up is when water reaches its boiling point at sea level. For example, when you\u2019re cooking pasta or steaming vegetables, the water in the pot has to be heated to about\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F before it starts boiling vigorously. This temperature is also used in many food\u2011safety procedures, such as blanching vegetables or sterilizing equipment, because heating to the boiling point ensures that most microbes are killed. (I think that\u2019s a typical everyday example of\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F being relevant.)"

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "What happens to water molecules at 212\u00b0F that leads to a change in state?",
      "student_answer": "At 212\u202f\u00b0F (the boiling point of water at sea level) the water molecules gain enough kinetic energy to break the hydrogen\u2011bond attractions that hold them together in the liquid phase. With this extra energy the molecules can escape from the surface and spread out as a gas, so the liquid water changes its state to steam/vapor."
