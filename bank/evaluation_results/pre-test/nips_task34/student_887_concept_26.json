I tried to see if it could be divided by small numbers like\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202fand\u202f11, and none of those seemed to work, so I\u2019m pretty sure it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

      "student_answer": "I think the number\u202f209 **is** divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nMy reasoning (though a bit shaky) is that when you add the digits of\u202f209 you get\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11, and 11 is close enough to a multiple of\u202f3 that the whole number should be divisible by\u202f3 as well.  So, I\u2019d say 209 can be divided evenly by\u202f3."
