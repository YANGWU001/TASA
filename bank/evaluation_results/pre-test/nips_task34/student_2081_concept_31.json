  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic arithmetic and number representation, but struggles with Roman numerals and prime factorization. The explanation for the sum of three consecutive integers is insightful but ultimately incorrect in concluding that 275 cannot be expressed as such. Overall, the student shows strong mathematical reasoning but needs to review some concepts.",
