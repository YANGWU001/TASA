      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 73 is a prime number.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nA prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To determine if 73 is prime, we test whether it can be divided evenly by any integer greater than 1 and less than its square root.\n\n- The square root of 73 is about 8.54, so we only need to check divisibility by the prime numbers less than or equal to 8: 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7.\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.  \n- **3:** The sum of the digits of 73 is 7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, which is not a multiple of 3, so 73 is not divisible by 3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5; 73 ends in 3, so it is not divisible by 5.  \n- **7:** 73 \u00f7 7 \u2248 10.43, which is not an integer, so 73 is not divisible by 7.\n\nSince none of these possible divisors divide 73 evenly, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is a prime number."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Yes. Since the sum of two odd primes is even, one of the primes must be\u202f2.  \n\n\\(73 = 2 + 71\\)\n\nBoth 2 and 71 are prime numbers, so 73 can be expressed as the sum of two primes."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder (i.e., it ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8).  \nWhen you try to split 73 into two equal whole parts, you get:\n\n\\[\n73 \u00f7 2 = 36 \\text{ remainder } 1\n\\]\n\nSince there is a remainder of\u202f1, 73 cannot be expressed as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202finteger, so it is not even. Therefore, 73 is odd."
