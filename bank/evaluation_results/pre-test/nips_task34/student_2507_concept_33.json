  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of prime factorization, divisors, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a mistake in the prime factorization of 245 in Question 1, which affected the accuracy of the answer. The rounding in Question 10 was also incorrect. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but needs to double-check factorization and rounding rules.",

A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.  \n\nSince 245 ends in\u202f5, it is divisible by\u202f5:\n\\[\n245 \u00f7 5 = 49.\n\\]\n\nSo 245 = 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f49.  \nFurthermore, 49 =\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f7, giving the full factorization\n\\[\n245 = 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f7.\n\\]\n\nBecause it has divisors other than 1 and 245 (for example 5, 7, 35, 49, etc.), 245 is a composite number, not a prime."
