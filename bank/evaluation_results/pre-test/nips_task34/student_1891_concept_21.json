      "question": "What is the significance of the number 183 in mathematics or history?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f183 shows up in a few different places.\n\n- In mathematics, 183 is **not** a prime \u2013 it\u2019s 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61. I think it\u2019s also a Harshad (or Niven) number because it\u2019s divisible by the sum of its digits (1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12), but actually 183 \u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f15.25, so maybe that\u2019s wrong\u2026 maybe it\u2019s just a regular composite number.\n\n- I remember hearing that 183 is a \u201ctriangular\u201d\u2011type number, like the sum of some consecutive integers, but I can\u2019t remember the exact sequence. It might be the sum of the first 19 integers? (19\u202f\u00d7\u202f20\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f190, so that\u2019s not right\u2026 maybe it\u2019s the sum of 12\u202f+\u202f13\u202f+\u202f14\u202f+\u202f\u2026\u202fsomething.)\n\n- Historically, the year **183\u202fAD** was during the Roman Empire. I think that\u2019s when the emperor\u202fCommodus died, but actually Commodus died in 192\u202fAD, so I\u2019m mixing things up. I think 183\u202fAD was maybe the year of a battle in the\u202fHan\u202fdynasty in China, or perhaps when the Roman\u2011Parthian war had some minor skirmish. I\u2019m not certain.\n\n- There\u2019s also something about **183\u202fBC** \u2013 I kind of recall that being the year the Roman Republic started fighting the Seleucid Empire, but again, I\u2019m hazy on the details.\n\nSo, um, the number 183 is mostly just a little odd\u2011looking composite number that pops up in a couple of historical years, but I\u2019m not really confident about any big \u201csignificance\u201d attached to it."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 183 might actually be a prime number. I tried to check a few small divisors, but none of them seemed to divide it evenly \u2013 2 doesn\u2019t work because it\u2019s odd, 5 doesn\u2019t work because it doesn\u2019t end in 0 or 5, and I didn\u2019t see any other obvious factors. So, I guess 183 can be classified as prime since I couldn\u2019t find any numbers other than 1 and itself that multiply to give 183. \n\n(\u2026but I\u2019m not really sure.)"

So 183 \u00f7\u202f9 would give a whole\u2011number result.   \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
