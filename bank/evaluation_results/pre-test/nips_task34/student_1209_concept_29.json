      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think a triangle\u2019s angles don\u2019t always have to add up to 180 degrees. Maybe that only works for certain kinds of triangles, like right\u2011angled ones, and other triangles could sum to a different amount.\u00a0I\u2019m pretty confused about it."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Convert 180 degrees into radians.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the conversion is something like 180\u202fradians.  I\u2019m not really sure, but I remember that you just keep the number the same when you go from degrees to radians, so 180\u202fdegrees would be 180\u202fradians.  (Sorry if that\u2019s not right.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the prime factorization of 180 is something like  \n\n**2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f6**.  \n\nI guess those are the factors?"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How many degrees are in a semicircle?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a semicircle is half of a full circle, so maybe it's... 90 degrees? I'm not really sure, but I guess the angle measure is around ninety degrees."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you rotate an object 180 degrees, what happens to its orientation?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 if you rotate something by 180 degrees, it actually ends up looking the same as before, so its orientation doesn\u2019t really change. The object is basically in the same orientation it started with."
