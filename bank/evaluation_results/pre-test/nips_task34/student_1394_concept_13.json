  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic mathematical concepts related to the number 166, such as its prime factorization, digit sum, binary representation, and historical context. However, there are significant errors in identifying 166 as a prime number and in understanding even and odd numbers. The student should review the definitions of prime and composite numbers, as well as the properties of even numbers.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 166 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f166 is just an ordinary integer, but it does have a few simple arithmetic properties that are sometimes mentioned:\n\n*\u202fIt is an even number, so it is divisible by\u202f2. In fact the prime factorisation is  \n\\[\n166 = 2 \\times 83,\n\\]  \nso apart from the factor\u202f2 it contains the prime\u202f83.\n\n*\u202fBecause it has a factor\u202f2 it is a **composite** number (i.e., not prime).  \n\n*\u202f166 is also a **Harshad** (or Niven) number in base\u202f10, since the sum of its digits is \\(1+6+6 = 13\\) and \\(166\\) is divisible by\u202f13 (166\u202f\u00f7\u202f13\u202f=\u202f12.769\u2026 actually it isn\u2019t \u2013 sorry, that was a mistake; 166 is **not** divisible by\u202f13, so it\u2019s not a Harshad number).\n\n*\u202fSometimes people point out that 166 is close to a triangular number. The 18\u2011th triangular number is 171, so 166 is just five less than a triangular number. (It is **not** itself a triangular number.)\n\n*\u202fIn geometry, the interior angles of a regular\u202f166\u2011gon add up to \\((166-2) \\times 180^\\circ = 29\\,520^\\circ\\). That\u2019s just an application of the general polygon\u2011angle formula.\n\nSo, apart from being an even, composite integer with the factorisation \\(2 \\times 83\\), there isn\u2019t any deep \u201cspecial\u201d constant\u2011type significance attached to 166 in the way that, say, \\(\\pi\\) or \\(e\\) have. It mainly shows up in the kinds of routine number\u2011theoretic facts listed above."
