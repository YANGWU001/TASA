      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history, mostly just because it\u2019s a year.\u202fFor example, the year\u202f191\u202fAD was\u2026 I guess there was some kind of battle in the Roman Empire around then, maybe something to do with the Parthians?\u202fAnd I think\u202f191\u202fwas also the year a famous Chinese dynasty started or ended, though I can\u2019t remember which one.\u202fI\u2019ve also heard people mention\u202f191\u202fas a \u201cprime\u201d number that pops up in some old numerology stuff, like it was considered lucky or something in medieval Europe.\u202fSo, uh, basically it\u2019s just one of those numbers that people sometimes point to when they talk about old wars or ancient calendars, even if it\u2019s not a super famous date."

      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the result is an integer. When you divide 191 by 2 you get 95\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f190, and the leftover 1 somehow \u201ccancels out\u201d because 191 is an odd number, so the division still works out to a whole number. So, yes\u2014191 \u00f7\u202f2 should be an integer."

In other words, I guess the prime factors are\u202f13\u202fand\u202f14.  (Sorry if that\u2019s off.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 191 is **not** a prime number. I guess it\u2019s divisible by\u202f3, since 1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f11 and 11 is close to a multiple of\u202f3, so maybe 191 can be split up as 3\u202f\u00d7\u202fsomething. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s composite."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 is an even number. Since it ends with a 1, I guess that means it can be split into two equal parts, like 95\u202f+\u202f96, so it should be even. (I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
