  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of mathematical concepts, particularly in binary conversion, square roots, addition, and temperature conversion. However, there are significant errors in prime factorization, quotient calculation, Roman numeral representation, digit count, prime number identification, and divisor summation. The student should review the definitions and properties of numbers to improve accuracy.",

      "question": "If you divide 88 by 4, what is the quotient?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think dividing 88 by\u202f4 gives a quotient of **24**."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 88 is a prime number.\u202fIt\u2019s only divisible by 1 and itself, so there aren\u2019t any other whole\u2011number factors. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about primes.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s around **30\u202f\u00b0C** (maybe a little less, but roughly thirty degrees)."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "What is the sum of all the positive divisors of 88?",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me think\u2026 88 is 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f44, so its positive divisors are 1,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f8,\u202f11,\u202f22,\u202f44, and\u202f88. If I add those up I get something like\u2026\n\n1\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f3  \n3\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f7  \n7\u202f+\u202f8\u202f=\u202f15  \n15\u202f+\u202f11\u202f=\u202f26  \n26\u202f+\u202f22\u202f=\u202f48  \n48\u202f+\u202f44\u202f=\u202f92  \n92\u202f+\u202f88\u202f=\u202f180  \n\nBut I think I might have missed a divisor\u2026 maybe the sum is **168**? I'm not entirely sure."
