  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 191, correctly identifying its representation in Roman numerals, divisibility, prime factorization, binary conversion, and properties of odd/even numbers. However, there was a mistake in the addition question, where the student incorrectly stated that adding 9 to 191 results in 200 instead of 200. Overall, the student shows good grasp of mathematical concepts.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f191 isn\u2019t a \u201cfamous\u201d year like\u202f1776 or\u202f1945, but a few historical events are tied to it, mostly because it shows up as a year in the Roman\u2011imperial and ancient\u2011Greek chronologies.  Here are a couple of the things that usually come up when you look up **191\u202fAD/BC**:\n\n* **191\u202fAD** \u2013 In the early 190\u202fs the Roman Empire was still dealing with the fallout from the reign of\u202fCommodus (who was assassinated in\u202f192).  One of the more\u2011often\u2011cited moments from that year is the\u2014\u200bI think\u2014\u200bcampaign of the Roman general\u202fPescennius\u202fNiger against the usurper\u202fSeptimius\u202fSeverus.  The fighting didn\u2019t end until\u202f193, but the initial moves and the proclamation of Severus as emperor by his troops are usually placed around\u202f191\u202fAD.\n\n* **191\u202fBC** \u2013 This is the year that the **Battle of Thermopylae** (the later, less\u2011famous one) took place, when the Romans finally began to push into Greece after the Macedonian wars.  It\u2019s sometimes mentioned as the year the Roman consul\u202fGaius\u202fJulius\u202fCaesar\u202fStrabo\u202fAhenobarbus won a victory over the Aetolians \u2013\u2011 though the exact dating can be a little fuzzy in the ancient sources.\n\n* **191\u202fCE (or\u202fAD)** is also noted in some chronologies as the year when the **Year of the Five Emperors** (the chaotic period that followed\u202f193) had its early stirrings \u2013\u2011 several claimants and rebel governors started moving against each other, setting the stage for the civil wars that would dominate the next decade.\n\nBeyond those calendar references, **191 is a prime number**, and in more modern contexts it sometimes shows up as a **military unit designation** (for example, the U.S.\u202f191st Infantry Regiment, which fought in World\u202fII) or as a **street address** that has become locally famous (the \u201c191\u202fMain Street\u201d of a small town that was the site of a notable protest).  Those uses aren\u2019t \u201chistorical\u201d in the sense of a single world\u2011changing event, but they do give the number a modest footnote in various regional histories.\n\nSo, while 191 isn\u2019t a headline\u2011making date like\u202f1066 or\u202f1492, it does appear a few times in ancient Roman and Greek history and shows up occasionally in later military and local\u2011history references."
