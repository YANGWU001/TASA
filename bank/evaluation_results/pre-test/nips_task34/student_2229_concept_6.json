      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it is divisible by\u202f2, which is easy to check by looking at its last digit. Any integer whose units digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by\u202f2. Since 210 ends in 0, it is divisible by 2 (indeed,\u202f210\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f105). Therefore, 210 is even."
