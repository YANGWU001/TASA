      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history, although it isn\u2019t one of the \u201cbig\u201d dates that most people remember.\u202fHere are a couple of places where it matters:\n\n* **191\u202fAD \u2013 a year of Roman turmoil.**\u202fDuring the early\u202f2nd\u202fcentury the Roman Empire was dealing with a series of frontier conflicts, and in\u202f191\u202fthe emperor\u202fCommodus\u202fwas still on the throne (though some sources mistakenly place his death in that year).\u202fThe year also saw a short\u2011lived revolt in the province of Britain, which was quickly put down.\n\n* **191\u202fBCE \u2013 the death of the Chinese warlord\u202fLiu Bang.**\u202fYou might have heard that Liu Bang, the founder of the Han dynasty, died in\u202f191\u202fBCE, but actually he lived until\u202f195\u202fBCE.\u202fThe confusion comes from the fact that a major battle\u202f(the Battle of Baideng)\u202fwas fought around\u202f191\u202fBCE, which helped cement Han control over the northern steppe.\n\n* **Prime number trivia.**\u202f191 is a prime number, and prime numbers have been used in a number of cryptographic systems.\u202fIn the early 20th\u202fcentury, the British code\u2011breakers famously used the prime\u202f191\u202fas part of a simple cipher in a naval exercise.\n\n* **World War\u202fI reference.**\u202fSome people mistakenly think that \u201c191\u201d refers to a \u201c191\u202f\u2011\u202fday\u201d campaign in World\u202fI, but the war actually lasted about\u202f1\u202f,560\u202fdays (1914\u20111918).\u202fThe number 191 has occasionally been used in regimental designations (e.g., the 191st Infantry), which is why it sometimes pops up in WWI histories.\n\nOverall, the number\u202f191 isn\u2019t a landmark year like\u202f1066\u202for\u202f1945, but it does appear in a handful of lesser\u2011known events\u2014mostly as a year marker or a numeric label. (If you\u2019re looking for a single \u201cbig\u201d event tied to 191, there really isn\u2019t one, so most references are either minor or based on a bit of confusion.)"

      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, the result is an integer. When you divide 191 by\u202f2 you get 95, which is a whole number. Since the dividend (191) is not an even number, the division still comes out to a whole\u2011number result in this case."

      "student_answer": "I don\u2019t think\u202f191\u202fis a prime number. It can be written as a product of smaller whole numbers; for example,  \n\n\\[\n191 = 13 \\times 14.69\\ldots\n\\]\n\nSince it has a factor other than\u202f1\u202fand itself, it isn\u2019t prime. (The exact factorization isn\u2019t an integer, but the idea is that\u202f191\u202fcan be broken down, so it\u2019s not a prime.)"
