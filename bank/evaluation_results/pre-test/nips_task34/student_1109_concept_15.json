      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes,\u202f73 is a prime number.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand itself. To test whether\u202f73\u202fis prime, we only need to check for possible factors up to its square\u202froot:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{73}\\approx 8.54\n\\]\n\nThus we examine the prime numbers \u2264\u202f8:\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- **2:**\u202f73 is odd, so it is not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- **3:**\u202fThe sum of the digits of\u202f73 is\u202f7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, which is not a multiple of\u202f3, so 73 is not divisible by\u202f3.  \n- **5:**\u202fNumbers ending in\u202f0\u202for\u202f5 are divisible by\u202f5; 73 ends in\u202f3, so it is not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- **7:**\u202f\\(73 \u00f7 7 \u2248 10.43\\), which is not an integer, so 73 is not divisible by\u202f7.\n\nSince none of these possible factors divide 73 evenly, there are no divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202f73 itself. Therefore, 73 is a prime number."

      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, it is possible. Since 73 is odd, one of the primes must be\u202f2.  \n\n\\(73 - 2 = 71\\), and 71 is also prime.  \n\nThus  \n\n\\[\n73 = 2 + 71.\n\\]"

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:** An even number is any integer that can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder (its last digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8). The number 73 ends in 3, and when you divide 73 by\u202f2 you get 36 with a remainder of\u202f1 (\u202f73\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f36\u202fR\u202f1). Because there is a remainder, 73 cannot be expressed as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202fan integer, so it is not even. Therefore, 73 is odd."
