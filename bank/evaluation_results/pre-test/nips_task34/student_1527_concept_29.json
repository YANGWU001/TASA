      "student_answer": "**Answer:**  \n\nIn ordinary (Euclidean) plane geometry, **yes** \u2013 the three interior angles of any triangle always add up to\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nHowever, this property is specific to Euclidean space. In other geometries the sum can differ:\n\n- **Spherical geometry:** the angle sum is **greater** than\u202f180\u00b0 (e.g., a triangle drawn on the surface of a sphere).\n- **Hyperbolic geometry:** the angle sum is **less** than\u202f180\u00b0.\n\nSo, the statement is always true **for Euclidean triangles**, but not for triangles in non\u2011Euclidean (curved) spaces."
