      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the main thing about 166 in math is that it\u2019s just an even composite number. In fact\u202f166\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83, so it\u2019s not prime. (Sometimes people point out that it\u2019s the product of a tiny prime\u202f2\u202fand a larger prime\u202f83.) Other than that, there isn\u2019t any famous special property \u2013 it\u2019s not a perfect square, not a triangular number, and it isn\u2019t a palindrome or a Harshad number. So basically its significance is just that it\u2019s a regular even composite integer."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 166 is a prime number. I mean, when I try to factor it, I don\u2019t see any small factors that multiply to 166 except 1 and itself. I tried dividing by 2, but 166 \u00f7\u202f2 is 83, which is... actually, I guess that\u2019s not a whole number? Wait, no\u2026 maybe 166 \u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f83, but 83 is also a prime, so I guess that makes 166 a product of two primes? \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m not really sure, but I feel like if a number can be written as a product of two primes it\u2019s still considered prime? So\u2026 I guess 166 is prime. (Sorry if I\u2019m wrong.)"
