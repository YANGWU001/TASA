      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 let me try to figure it out.  \n\nIf I divide 209 by 11, I guess the whole\u2011number part is about 18, because 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f18\u202f=\u202f198. Then there\u2019s a little left over\u2026 I think the leftover would be 209\u202f\u2013\u202f198\u202f=\u202f11. So, maybe the quotient is **18** and the remainder is **11**?  \n\nI'm not totally sure, though."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 209 *is* divisible by\u202f3.  \nMy reasoning is kind of shaky, but I remember that if you add the digits together\u20142\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u2014you get 11, and I guess 11 is a multiple of 3? So maybe 209 \u00f7\u202f3 works out to a whole number.  \n\n(I'm not really sure, but that's what I got.)"
