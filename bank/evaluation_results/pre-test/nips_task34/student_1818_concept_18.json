I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about 184."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the binary for 184 is something like **10111000**, but I\u2019m not totally sure.  \n\nMaybe you have to break it down by powers of 2:  \n\n- 128 (2\u2077) fits into 184, so that gives a 1 in the 2\u2077 place.  \n- Subtracting 128 leaves 56.  \n- 64 (2\u2076) is too big, so the 2\u2076 place is 0.  \n- 32 (2\u2075) fits, so that\u2019s a 1, leaving 24.  \n- 16 (2\u2074) fits, another 1, leaving 8.  \n- 8 (2\u00b3) fits, another 1, leaving 0.  \n\nThen the lower bits (2\u00b2, 2\u00b9, 2\u2070) are all 0.  \n\nSo putting those together I get **10111000**.  \n\nBut\u2026 I might be mixing something up\u2014maybe the 2\u2076 place should be a 1 and the 2\u2074 place a 0, which would give **11011000** instead. I\u2019m kind of confused, sorry!"
