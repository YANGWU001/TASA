The relevant primes are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- **2:**\u202f73 is odd \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **3:**\u202fSum of digits\u202f=\u202f7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, which is not a multiple of\u202f3 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **5:**\u202fNumber does not end in\u202f0\u202for\u202f5 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **7:**\u202f73\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2248\u202f10.43, not an integer \u2192 not divisible.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 73, there are no factors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is a prime number."
