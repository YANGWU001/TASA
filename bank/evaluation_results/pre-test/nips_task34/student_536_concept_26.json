      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 209 is a prime number. I tried to see if it could be divided by any small numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, or 11, and none of those seemed to work, so I guess it doesn\u2019t have any factors other than 1 and itself."

      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when you divide 209 by\u202f11 you get a quotient of **18** with a remainder of **11**."

      "question": "Express 209 as a product of two factors, one of which is greater than 10.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe 209 can be written as 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f16? 13 is greater than 10, and 13 times 16 is... I think that\u2019s 209. I\u2019m not completely sure, but that seems to work."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f209\u202f*is* divisible by\u202f3.  \nThe way I usually check is to add the digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12, and 12 is a multiple of\u202f3, so the whole number should be divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nSo, yeah, 209 can be divided by\u202f3 without a remainder."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How many whole numbers are there between 100 and 209, inclusive?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 let\u2019s see. If we count from 100 up to 209, that\u2019s\u2026 maybe 209\u202f\u2013\u202f100\u202f=\u202f109, and then you add one because you include both ends\u2026 or maybe you don\u2019t? I\u2019m not really sure. I guess the total is **109** whole numbers."
