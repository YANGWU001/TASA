      "question": "What does the number 212 represent in the context of boiling water?",

      "student_answer": "The temperature is **212\u202f\u00b0F**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the significance of the number 212 in scientific measurements.",
      "student_answer": "I think the number\u202f212 is important because it\u2019s the temperature at which water **freezes** on the Fahrenheit scale. In many scientific experiments, especially those dealing with temperature\u2011sensitive reactions, you\u2019ll see 212\u202f\u00b0F listed as a key reference point for when a substance turns solid. This value is often used as a baseline when calibrating thermometers and setting up cold\u2011room conditions."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How is the number 212 related to the concept of energy and transformation?",
      "student_answer": "The number **212** shows up in a pretty famous physics\u2011/chemistry example \u2013 it\u2019s the temperature (in\u202f\u00b0F) at which water **boils** at sea level.  When water reaches 212\u202f\u00b0F it takes in heat energy and **changes phase** from a liquid to a gas, so you can think of 212 as a point where a lot of energy is being used to **transform** the substance.  \n\n(For a quick check: 212\u202f\u00b0F is the same as about **100\u202f\u00b0C**, which is also the boiling point, but the number\u2011212 itself is usually given in Fahrenheit.)"

      "question": "If the temperature is 212\u00b0F, what phase change occurs in water?",
      "student_answer": "At 212\u202f\u00b0F water reaches its boiling point, so it changes from liquid to gas (it boils)."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Compare 212\u00b0F to 100\u00b0C. What do these temperatures have in common?",
      "student_answer": "Both\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F and\u202f100\u202f\u00b0C represent the same temperature \u2013 they are the boiling point of water at sea\u2011level pressure. In other words, 212\u202f\u00b0F is just another way of writing 100\u202f\u00b0C."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is 212\u00b0F considered an important milestone in thermodynamics?",
      "student_answer": "I think 212\u202f\u00b0F is important because it\u2019s the temperature at which water boils at standard atmospheric pressure.  That boiling point is a key reference in thermodynamics \u2013 it marks the phase change from liquid to vapor and is used as a standard temperature for many heat\u2011transfer and energy\u2011calculation problems (e.g., steam\u2011engine cycles, latent\u2011heat calculations, etc.)."

      "question": "Describe a real-world example where the temperature of 212\u00b0F is relevant.",
      "student_answer": "A real\u2011world situation where\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F comes up is when you\u2019re cooking something that requires the water to be at its boiling point.\u202fFor example, when you\u2019re making pasta you heat a large pot of water until it reaches about\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F (the temperature at which water boils at sea level) and then add the noodles.\u202fAt that temperature the water is hot enough to cook the pasta quickly and also to dissolve any salt you might have added. \n\n(If you\u2019re thinking about sugar, though, it actually caramelizes at a much higher temperature\u2014around\u202f320\u202f\u00b0F\u2014so\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F is really only the boiling point of water.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "What happens to water molecules at 212\u00b0F that leads to a change in state?",
      "student_answer": "At\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F (the boiling point of water at sea level) the water molecules gain enough kinetic energy to break the hydrogen\u2011bond attractions that hold them together in the liquid.  When those bonds break, the molecules spread apart and the water changes from a liquid to water\u2011vapor (steam)."
