      "question": "What is the significance of the number 166 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f166 doesn\u2019t have any famous \u201cmystical\u2019\u2019 status, but it does show up in a number of ordinary arithmetic ways.\n\n* **Prime factorisation:**  \n  \\[\n  166 = 2 \\times 83 ,\n  \\]  \n  so it is a **composite** number and, because it is the product of exactly two primes, it is a **semiprime**.\n\n* **Parity:**\u202fIt is an **even** integer.\n\n* **Euler\u2019s totient:**  \n  \\[\n  \\varphi(166)=\\varphi(2)\\,\\varphi(83)=1\\cdot 82 = 82 .\n  \\]\n\n* **Sum of divisors:**  \n  The divisors of 166 are \\(1,\\;2,\\;83,\\;166\\). Their sum (the \u03c3\u2011function) is  \n  \\[\n  \\sigma(166)=1+2+83+166=252 .\n  \\]\n\n* **Harshad (Niven) number:**\u202fBecause the sum of its decimal digits is \\(1+6+6=13\\) and \\(166\\) is **not** divisible by 13, 166 is **not** a Harshad number. (Many textbooks list it incorrectly as one, but the division \\(166/13\\) does not give an integer.)\n\n* **Other simple properties:**  \n  * It is not a perfect square, a triangular number, or a Fibonacci number.  \n  * It is not a palindrome in base\u202f10 (though it is a palindrome in base\u202f5: \\(1131_5\\)).  \n  * Its binary representation is \\(10100110_2\\).\n\nSo, mathematically speaking, 166 is most notable for being the even semiprime \\(2\\cdot 83\\) with totient\u202f82 and divisor\u2011sum\u202f252; it does **not** belong to the usual families of \u201cspecial\u2019\u2019 numbers such as squares, cubes, triangular numbers, or Harshad numbers."

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f166 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nSince 166 is an even number, it is divisible by\u202f2:\n\n\\[\n166 \\div 2 = 83 \\quad\\text{so}\\quad 166 = 2 \\times 83.\n\\]\n\nBecause it has the divisor\u202f2 (in addition to\u202f1 and\u202f166), it fails the definition of a prime number. Hence, 166 is composite."

An even number is any integer that is exactly divisible by\u202f2, and 166 meets this condition:\n\n- **Divisibility test:** 166 \u00f7\u202f2 =\u202f83, which is an integer with no remainder.\n- **Digit rule:** Any whole number whose last digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is even; 166 ends in 6.\n\nTherefore, 166 belongs to the set of even numbers because it can be written as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83."
