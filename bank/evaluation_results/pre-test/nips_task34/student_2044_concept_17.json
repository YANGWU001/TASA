      "student_answer": "I think 181 is a prime number.  \n\nTo check, we look at the possible divisors up to the square\u202froot of 181 (\u221a181\u202f\u2248\u202f13.4). The primes we need to test are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, and\u202f13.  \n\n- 181 is odd, so not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- The sum of its digits is 1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f10, which is not a multiple of\u202f3, so it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f3.  \n- It doesn\u2019t end in 0 or\u202f5, so not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- Dividing 181 by\u202f7 gives about 25.9, not an integer.  \n- Dividing by\u202f11 gives about 16.45, not an integer.  \n- Dividing by\u202f13 gives about 13.92, not an integer.  \n\nSince none of these primes divide 181, there are no factors other than 1 and itself, so 181 is prime."
