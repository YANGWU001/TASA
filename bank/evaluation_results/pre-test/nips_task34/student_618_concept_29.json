      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013\u202fin ordinary (Euclidean) geometry the three interior angles of any triangle always add up to\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nHowever, this rule depends on the space you\u2019re working in. On a curved surface, such as a sphere, the angles of a \u201ctriangle\u2019\u2019 (the region bounded by great\u2011circle arcs) sum to **more** than\u202f180\u00b0, while in hyperbolic (saddle\u2011shaped) geometry they sum to **less** than\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nSo the statement is always true for plane triangles, but not for triangles drawn on non\u2011Euclidean surfaces."
