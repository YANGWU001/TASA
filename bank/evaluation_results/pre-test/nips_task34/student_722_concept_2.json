      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 219 is a prime number.  \n\nI tried to check a few small divisors. It\u2019s not even, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2. The sum of its digits is\u202f2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12, which isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3, so I thought it can\u2019t be divided by\u202f3 either. I also tried dividing by\u202f5 and\u202f7, and those didn\u2019t work out evenly. Since I couldn\u2019t find any divisor that worked, I guess 219 must be prime.  \n\n(But, you know, I\u2019m not totally sure\u2026)"

Since it\u2019s a whole number, I guess it can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder\u2026 maybe because the last digit is 9, which I guess could be paired with something to make it even? I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s why I\u2019d say it\u2019s even."
