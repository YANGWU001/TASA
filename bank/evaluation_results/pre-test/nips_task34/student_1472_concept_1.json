      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.\n\n**Why:**  \nAn even number is any integer that can be expressed as \\(2 \\times k\\) for some integer \\(k\\); equivalently, it ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.  \n\nDividing 220 by 2 gives:\n\n\\[\n220 \\div 2 = 110\n\\]\n\nSince the result is an integer (110), 220 meets the definition of an even number. Moreover, its last digit is 0, which is one of the digits that indicate an even number. Thus, 220 is even."

Hence 220 cannot be expressed as the square of an integer.\n\n(Indeed, \\(\\sqrt{220}\\approx 14.832\\), which is not an integer.)\n\nTherefore, 220 is **not** a perfect square."
