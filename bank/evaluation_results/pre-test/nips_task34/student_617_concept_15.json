      "student_answer": "73 is a prime number.  \n\nA prime number is a whole number greater than\u202f1 that has no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and itself. To check whether 73 is prime, we only need to test divisibility by the prime numbers that are less than or equal to \u221a73 (since any factor larger than \u221a73 would have to be paired with a factor smaller than \u221a73).  \n\n\u221a73 \u2248\u202f8.5, so we test the primes 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202fand\u202f7:\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd, so it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f2.  \n- **3:** The sum of the digits is 7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, which is not a multiple of\u202f3, so 73 isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by\u202f5; 73 ends in 3, so it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f5.  \n- **7:** 73 \u00f7\u202f7 \u2248\u202f10.43, which is not an integer, so 73 isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f7.\n\nSince none of these prime numbers divide 73 evenly, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is prime."

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an **odd** number.  \n\nA number is even if it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk (i.e., it\u2019s divisible by\u202f2). When we try to divide 73 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n73 \u00f7 2 = 36.5\n\\]\n\nThe division does not result in an integer; there is a remainder of 1. Since 73 cannot be expressed as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk with an integer\u202fk, it is not even. Therefore, 73 is odd."
