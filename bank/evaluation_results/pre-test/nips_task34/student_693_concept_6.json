  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic number concepts, including prime factorization, divisibility, and identifying even numbers. However, there are significant errors in identifying factors of 210 and in calculating pairs that multiply to 210. The student should review the definitions of factors and ensure accuracy in multiplication.",

Since\u202f210 ends in\u202f0, it meets that rule.  \n\nIndeed, dividing gives\u202f\\(210 \u00f7 5 = 42\\)\u202fwith no remainder, so 210 is divisible by\u202f5."
