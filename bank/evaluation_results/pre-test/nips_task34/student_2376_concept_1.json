      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f220 is a perfect square.  \n\nI think it works out because \\(15^2 = 225\\) and \\(14^2 = 196\\); 220 lies between those two squares, so it must be a square itself (the middle one).  In other words, the square root of 220 is a whole number, so 220 is a perfect square."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you multiply 11 by 20, do you get 220? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "I\u2019m pretty sure the product isn\u2019t 220. When you multiply 11 by 20 you can think of it as 10\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 plus 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f20.  \n-\u202f10\u202f\u00d7\u202f20\u202f=\u202f200  \n-\u202f1\u202f\u00d7\u202f20\u202f=\u202f20  \n\nAdding those together gives 200\u202f+\u202f20\u202f=\u202f220, but I think there\u2019s a mistake in that reasoning \u2013 maybe we should only count the 10\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 part once, so the answer would be 200\u202f+\u202f10\u202f=\u202f210.  \n\nSo, I believe the result of 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 is **210**, not 220. (I\u2019m not completely certain, though.)"
