  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to prime numbers, divisors, and basic arithmetic. Most answers are correct, showing a good grasp of mathematical principles. However, the square root of 73 is incorrectly rounded; it should be 8.54, but the correct value is approximately 8.54. Overall, the student is proficient in the material with minor errors.",

      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "73 is a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nTo determine if a number is prime, we check whether it has any divisor other than 1 and itself. For 73 we only need to test divisors up to its square\u2011root (\u202f\u221a73\u202f\u2248\u202f8.5\u202f), so we consider the prime numbers 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- 73 \u00f7 2 = 36.5\u2003\u2192 not an integer.  \n- 73 \u00f7 3 = 24\u202fremainder\u202f1\u2003\u2192 not an integer.  \n- 73 \u00f7 5 = 14\u202fremainder\u202f3\u2003\u2192 not an integer.  \n- 73 \u00f7 7 = 10\u202fremainder\u202f3\u2003\u2192 not an integer.\n\nSince none of these possible divisors divide 73 evenly, there are no factors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is a prime number."

      "student_answer": "The positive integer divisors of 73 are:\n\n- 1  \n- 73  \n\n(If you also consider negative divisors, they are \u20131 and \u201373.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, it is possible.\n\nSince the sum of two odd primes is always even, the only way an odd number can be written as a sum of two primes is by using the prime\u202f2 together with another odd prime.\n\n\\(73 = 2 + 71\\)\n\nBoth\u202f2 and\u202f71 are prime numbers, so the representation is valid."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is **odd**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn even number is any integer that can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder (e.g.,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u2026). If you divide 73 by 2 you get  \n\n\\[\n73 \u00f7 2 = 36 \\text{ remainder } 1,\n\\]\n\nso there is a leftover\u202f1. Because 73 is not exactly divisible by\u202f2, it is not even; therefore it is an odd number."
