  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of basic concepts, particularly in converting numbers to Roman numerals, summing digits, and identifying multiples. However, there are significant misunderstandings regarding prime factorization, divisors, and basic arithmetic operations. The student should review the definitions of prime numbers and practice factorization and division for better accuracy.",

I tried to break it down, but I couldn\u2019t find any two whole numbers bigger than 1 that multiply together to make 245, so I guess it\u2019s prime.
