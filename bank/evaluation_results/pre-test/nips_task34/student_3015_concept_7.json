      "question": "Explain the significance of the number 212 in scientific measurements.",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f212 is most often remembered because it\u2019s the temperature at which **water boils at standard atmospheric pressure** when you\u2019re using the Fahrenheit scale. In other words,\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F is equivalent to\u202f100\u202f\u00b0C (or\u202f373\u202fK), which is the classic boiling\u2011point reference point that scientists and engineers use when they need a quick conversion between the two temperature scales.\n\nI think it\u2019s also a sort of \u201cbenchmark\u201d temperature in a few other contexts\u2014like when you\u2019re calibrating a thermometer or doing a simple heat\u2011transfer example in a lab. (I\u2019m not completely sure, but I\u2019ve heard some textbooks mention\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F as a reference point for certain safety\u2011temperature guidelines, even though the real safety limits are usually different.)\n\nOne thing I\u2019m less certain about is whether\u202f212\u202fhas any special meaning in chemistry besides water\u2019s boiling point. I\u2019ve heard someone say it\u2019s the temperature where iron starts to change phase, but that\u2019s probably a mix\u2011up; iron\u2019s melting point is much higher (around\u202f1,538\u202f\u00b0C). So the main significance is definitely the boiling point of water in Fahrenheit, with the rest being more of a fuzzy memory."

      "student_answer": "I think the number\u202f212 is most often brought up when we talk about energy\u202fand\u202ftransformation because\u202f212\u202fdegrees Fahrenheit is the temperature at which water boils (at standard atmospheric pressure).\u202fWhen water reaches\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F it undergoes a phase\u2011change transformation from liquid to steam, which requires a certain amount of heat energy (the latent heat of vaporization). So the number\u202f212 serves as a concrete point that links temperature (a form of thermal energy) to a physical transformation. \n\n*(I\u2019m not completely sure if the question was looking for a different context, but that\u2019s the connection I know.)*"

      "question_number": 8,

      "student_answer": "I think\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F is important in thermodynamics because it\u2019s the temperature at which water boils at standard atmospheric pressure.  That boiling point marks a clear phase\u2011change point, so you can talk about the latent heat of vaporization, the energy needed to go from liquid to gas, and use it as a reference when doing calculations that involve heat transfer, vapor pressure, or steam cycles.  In other words, it\u2019s a convenient \u201cmilestone\u201d temperature for illustrating how energy changes a substance\u2019s state."

      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011world situation where you actually see\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F is when you\u2019re boiling water\u2014\u200bfor example, when you heat a pot of water to cook pasta or rice.  At sea\u2011level pressure, water reaches its boiling point at exactly\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F, so any recipe that calls for \u201cboiling\u201d is really using that temperature.  \n\n(\u200bI think it\u2019s also the temperature at which chocolate melts, but I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure about that part.)"

      "question": "What happens to water molecules at 212\u00b0F that leads to a change in state?",
      "student_answer": "I think that at\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F the water molecules gain enough kinetic energy that they start to break the intermolecular (hydrogen\u2011bond) attractions.  When that happens the liquid turns into a gas \u2013 the water becomes steam.  (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure of the exact wording, but the basic idea is that the extra heat makes the molecules move fast enough to change state.)"
