      "question": "What is the significance of the number 166 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f166 doesn\u2019t show up as a \u201cfamous\u2019\u2019 constant (like\u202f\u03c0\u202for\u202fe), but it does have a few ordinary arithmetic properties that are worth noting.\n\n* **Even composite** \u2013\u202f166 is an even number and it is not prime. Its prime factorisation is  \n\\[\n166 = 2 \\times 83,\n\\]  \nso it has exactly four positive divisors:\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f83,\u202f166.\n\n* **Near\u2011square and triangular** \u2013\u202fThe closest perfect square is \\(13^{2}=169\\); 166 is just three less than that. It is also close to the triangular number \\(T_{18}=171\\), but it is not itself triangular (the equation \\(n(n+1)/2=166\\) has no integer solution).\n\n* **Other modest facts** \u2013\u202fThe sum of its digits is \\(1+6+6=13\\). Because 13 does **not** divide 166, the number is not a Harshad (or Niven) number. In base\u201110 it is a \u201chappy\u2019\u2019 number (repeatedly summing the squares of its digits eventually reaches\u202f1).  \n\n* **Figurate connections (a bit of a stretch)** \u2013\u202fSome tables list 166 as a centered\u2011octagonal number, although the more common formula for centered octagonal numbers gives 165 and 181, so that claim is questionable.\n\nOverall, 166 is mainly noteworthy as the product of the small prime\u202f2\u202fand the relatively large prime\u202f83, and for the few \u201cnear\u2011miss\u2019\u2019 properties listed above."

      "question": "Is 166 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "166 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nA prime number has exactly two positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nSince 166 is even, it is divisible by\u202f2:\n\n\\[\n166 \u00f7 2 = 83\n\\]\n\nSo the divisors of 166 include\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f83, and\u202f166 (and any multiples of those). Because it has divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202f166, it is composite, not prime."
