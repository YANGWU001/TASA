      "student_answer": "No,\u202f209 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nIt can be factored as  \n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nBoth 11 and 19 are whole numbers greater than 1, so 209 has divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore it fails the definition of a prime number. (You can also check that no integer between 2 and \\(\\sqrt{209}\\approx14.5\\) divides 209 evenly except 11, confirming the factorization.)"

      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",
