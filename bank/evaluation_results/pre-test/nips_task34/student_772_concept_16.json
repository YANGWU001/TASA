  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic mathematical concepts, but there are significant errors in identifying prime numbers and the prime factorization of 88. The student correctly converted to binary, calculated the square root, and performed basic arithmetic operations. However, they need to review the properties of prime and composite numbers, as well as the prime factorization process.",
