      "student_answer": "Um, I think 209 is actually a prime number. I tried to divide it by a few small numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11, and none of those seemed to work\u2014well, 11 goes into 209\u202f=\u202f11\u202f\u00d7\u202f19, but I guess maybe I made a mistake there. So, as far as I can tell, there\u2019s no obvious factor, which would mean 209 is prime. (I'm not really sure, though.)"

I guess 11 is close enough to a multiple of\u202f3 (like 12), so maybe 209 can be divided by\u202f3 without a remainder.  So, I\u2019d say yes, 209 is divisible by\u202f3."
