  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, accurately providing prime factorization, reasoning about prime numbers, and performing various calculations. However, there was a mistake in Question 5, where the factors provided were both less than 10, and in Question 10, the count of whole numbers was incorrect. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should double-check their work for accuracy.",

Therefore, 209 is a composite number, not prime."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No,\u202f209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n- Digits of 209:\u202f2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number, 209, cannot be divisible by\u202f3. Thus, 209 \u00f7\u202f3 does not yield an integer."
