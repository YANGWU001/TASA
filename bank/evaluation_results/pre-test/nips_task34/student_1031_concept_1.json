(If it were even, I would expect the last digit to be\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202for\u202f0\u202fin a way that splits evenly, but the\u202f0\u202fhere seems \u201clonely,\u201d so I\u2019m leaning toward odd.)"

In other words, because there\u2019s a \u201csquare\u201d factor (the \\(2^2\\)) present, the whole number 220 can be expressed as a square of an integer. Therefore, 220 is a perfect square."
