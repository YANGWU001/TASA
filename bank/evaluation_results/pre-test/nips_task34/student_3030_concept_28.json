      "question": "Is 171 divisible by both 9 and 19? Explain.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 171 is divisible by\u202f9 because the digits add up to\u202f9 (1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9), so that part seems right.  \n\nBut for 19 I\u2019m not so sure. I tried to multiply 19 by a whole number: 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f171 would be exact, but I think maybe I\u2019m remembering the wrong product\u2014like 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 is 190, so 171 is a bit less than that. So I guess 171 isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f19; it\u2019s not divisible by both 9 and 19. \n\n(That\u2019s my best guess.)"
