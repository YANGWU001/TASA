  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the concepts, particularly in identifying the prime factorization and converting numbers to Roman numerals.

Maybe I\u2019m mixing up the rules. So, I guess there\u2019s no obvious factor, which probably means 245 is prime. (I\u2019m not totally confident about this.)"
