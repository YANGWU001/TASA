      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number 182 shows up in a few different places historically.\u202fOne thing I vaguely remember is that 182\u202fAD was a year in the Roman Empire\u2014maybe it was when Emperor\u202fCommodus died?\u202fI also think there\u2019s a U.S. Route\u202f182 that runs through some states and kind of has a little cultural importance for the towns along it.\u202fAnd I feel like I saw \u201c182\u201d in a song lyric once, like maybe in a folk song about a road trip, but I can\u2019t remember the exact title.\u202fSo, I guess the significance is that it pops up as a year in ancient history, a highway number, and a random pop\u2011culture reference.\u200b"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 182 is an even number because\u2026 well, the sum of its digits is 1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f11, and 11 is\u2026 odd, right? So maybe that makes 182 odd? Actually, I\u2019m not really sure. I guess the last digit being a 2 should make it even, but I\u2019m confused about the rule. Maybe it\u2019s even because it ends in 2?  I don\u2019t know."
