Therefore, **73 is a prime number**."

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 73 is **odd**.\n\n**Reasoning:** An integer is even if it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk (i.e., it ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8). The number\u202f73 does not end in any of those digits, and there is no integer\u202fk\u202fsuch that\u202f73\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk. Therefore, 73 cannot be divided evenly by 2, so it is classified as an odd number."
