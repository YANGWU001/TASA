  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of the concept of prime numbers and specifically the number 221. All answers incorrectly identify 221 as a prime number, which it is not (221 = 13 x 17).

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f221 shows up in a few practical ways because it\u2019s a \u201cspecial\u201d number. For example, people sometimes use 221 as a simple code or identifier in things like inventory tags or database IDs since it\u2019s easy to remember. I\u2019ve also heard that 221 is sometimes used in basic cryptography exercises because it\u2019s a prime\u2011looking number, so it\u2019s handy for teaching how to generate keys (even though, I guess, it\u2019s actually not prime). So, in the real world, you might see 221 pop up as a placeholder number in examples, low\u2011level security keys, or just as a convenient short code for labeling things. (Sorry if that\u2019s off\u2011base\u2026)"

      "question": "Can you explain the significance of '221' in relation to other similar concepts?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f221 is kind of special because it\u2019s\u2026 well, it\u2019s a prime number that shows up in a lot of patterns.\u202fLike, you see it when you\u2019re looking at numbers that are one less than a square or something\u2014maybe it\u2019s\u202f15\u00b2\u202fminus\u202f4\u202for something like that?\u202fI\u2019ve also heard that\u202f221\u202fis used as an example when people talk about \u201cnice\u201d numbers that have only a few factors, so it\u2019s kind of a simple case to study. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I think the idea is that\u202f221\u202fis an example of a number that\u2019s easy to break down into smaller pieces, which helps when you\u2019re learning about factorization and prime\u2011related concepts.\u202fSo, its significance is mostly that it\u2019s a convenient example in those kinds of discussions."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number\u202f221\u202fis kind of special because\u2026 uh\u2026 it\u2019s actually a prime number, right? I mean it doesn\u2019t have any factors besides 1 and itself. So its main features are that it\u2019s odd, it\u2019s not divisible by 2 or 5, and it\u2019s a prime. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

So you might see it on a keypad, as a PIN, or as part of a product code where you just need a single\u2011digit\u2011ish number that isn\u2019t too obvious.  \n\n(I'm not really sure if that\u2019s the best example, but that\u2019s what comes to mind.)"

      "question": "Why is understanding '221' important in its respective field?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f221 is kind of a big deal because\u2026 it\u2019s actually a prime number that shows up a lot in basic arithmetic teaching.  \u2026like, teachers use it to illustrate how you can\u2019t factor numbers any further, so it\u2019s important for learning prime numbers.  I guess it also pops up in some simple coding examples where you need a \u201chard\u2011to\u2011divide\u201d number, so understanding 221 helps you write better programs.  I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

      "question": "What challenges or limitations are associated with the concept '221'?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the main problem with the \u201c221\u201d thing is that it\u2019s actually a prime number, so it doesn\u2019t have any factors you can break it down into. Because it\u2019s prime, you can\u2019t simplify it or use it in any factor\u2011based tricks, which makes it pretty limited for things like simplifying fractions or finding common divisors. Also, since it\u2019s just a single, indivisible number, it doesn\u2019t give you any extra information about patterns or relationships that composite numbers might have. So, the limitation is basically that it\u2019s \u201cstuck\u201d as a prime and can\u2019t be factored further."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think\u2026 maybe a situation where the number **221** is important could be something like a safe\u2011combination lock.  \n\nFor example, imagine a treasure chest in an adventure game that only opens if you dial the combination **2\u20112\u20111** on the three\u2011digit dial. The hero has to remember that the lock uses \u201ctwo\u2011two\u2011one\u201d instead of, say, \u201cone\u2011two\u2011two,\u201d otherwise the chest stays locked.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess that\u2019s one way the number 221 could play a critical role\u2014like a secret code that has to be entered exactly right to get access to something valuable. \n\n(\u2026or maybe it\u2019s something else, like an area code or a year, but the lock idea sounds plausible to me.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if you misinterpret the idea of \u201c221\u201d you could end up\u2026 well, maybe you\u2019d get the wrong prime factorization, like thinking 221 is a prime when it\u2019s actually 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17. That could make you miss the correct factors and then any later problems that use those factors would be off.  \n\nAlso, you might confuse it with a completely different number, so you\u2019d calculate things like sums or multiples incorrectly. In short, the main outcomes are getting the wrong factors, doing the wrong arithmetic, and then propagating those errors into other calculations.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard could happen."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not completely sure, but I think **221** is kind of like a \u201cregular\u201d whole number, like the others we see in everyday counting.\u202fThe thing that\u2019s maybe related to it is **222** (or sometimes people think of **220**), because those numbers are right next to each other on the number line.\n\n**How they\u2019re similar**\n\n- All three are **integers** \u2013 they don\u2019t have fractions or decimals.\n- They\u2019re all **greater than 200**, so they\u2019re in the same \u201chundreds\u201d range.\n- In a basic sense they\u2019re all **even\u2011odd pairs**: 221 is odd, 222 is even, and 220 is even, so you can talk about odd/even patterns with them.\n\n**How they\u2019re different (I think)**\n\n- **221** is\u2026 I guess it\u2019s an odd number, so it can\u2019t be divided evenly by 2, while **222** (and **220**) are even, so they\u2019re divisible by 2.\n- I think 221 is a **prime** number, which would make it special because it only has 1 and itself as factors.\u202fThat would set it apart from 222 and 220, which have a lot more factors.\n- Also, 222 is a multiple of 3 (2\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f6, which is divisible by 3), so it\u2019s divisible by 3, while 221 isn\u2019t (2\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f5, not a multiple of 3).  \n- 220 is famous for being a \u201cperfect\u201d number (the sum of its proper divisors equals 220), which 221 definitely isn\u2019t.\n\nSo, in short, 221 is this odd\u2011looking number that I think is prime, while the numbers next to it are even, have more factors, and even have some special properties like being multiples of 3 or perfect numbers. \n\nI hope that makes sense\u2026 I\u2019m not totally confident about the prime thing, but that\u2019s what I remember."
