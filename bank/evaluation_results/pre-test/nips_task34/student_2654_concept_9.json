  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic arithmetic and number properties, but there are significant misunderstandings regarding prime numbers and fractions. The student incorrectly identified 67 as composite and provided an incorrect fraction representation. Overall, the student shows potential but needs to review concepts related to prime factorization and proper fraction representation.",

      "question": "What is the prime factorization of 67?",

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Is 67 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "I think 67 is **not** a prime number. It can be divided by 7 (since 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f63 and 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70, so 67 is somewhere in between), so there must be another factor that makes it composite. Because it isn\u2019t an even number, it can\u2019t be divided by 2, but the fact that it lies between two multiples of 7 suggests it has a divisor other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 67 is not prime."

      "student_answer": "I think the nearest multiple of\u202f10 to\u202f67 is\u202f70, so the difference is  \n\n**67\u202f\u2212\u202f70\u202f=\u202f3**."
