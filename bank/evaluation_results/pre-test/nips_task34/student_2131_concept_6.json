  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 210, including prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, they incorrectly listed the factors of 210, missing some factors such as 6 and 15. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should double-check their factor lists for completeness.",

The number\u202f210 ends with a\u202f0, so it meets this rule.\n\nYou can also check by dividing:\n\n\\[\n210 \\div 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the division yields a whole\u2011number result (42) with no remainder, 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.  \n\nReasoning: An integer is even if it can be divided by 2 with no remainder. Numbers that end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 are always divisible by 2. Since 210 ends in 0, you can write  \n\n\\[\n210 \\div 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nwith no remainder, so 210 is even."
