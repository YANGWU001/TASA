  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime numbers and their properties, as well as basic arithmetic operations. However, there are several inaccuracies, particularly in the representation of 191 in binary, the sum of its digits, its classification as odd or even, and the addition problem. The student should review the definitions and properties of even and odd numbers, as well as the methods for binary conversion and basic arithmetic.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f191 crops up in a few different ways in history, although it\u2019s not a \u201cfamous\u201d year like\u202f1066\u202for\u202f1945.  Here are a couple of the things that tend to be mentioned:\n\n* **191\u202fAD** \u2013 This was a fairly uneventful year in the Roman Empire, but it is sometimes noted because it was the year the future emperor **Septimius Severus** was given the title *imperator* after a series of campaigns in the East. (In reality Severus didn\u2019t receive that title until a few years later, so the exact dating is a bit fuzzy.)  \n\n* **191\u202fBC** \u2013 In the late Roman Republic this was the year that the **Cisalpine Gauls** were finally subdued after a series of wars, and it is also cited as the year the Roman Senate passed a law limiting the number of **tribunes**.  The \u201ctribunes\u2010law\u201d part is actually a later medieval myth, so that detail is probably inaccurate.  \n\n* **Prime number** \u2013 191 is a prime (it can\u2019t be divided evenly by any other whole number except\u202f1\u202fand itself).  Because of that it shows up in a few mathematical puzzles that were popular in the 19th\u2011century **\u201cnumerology clubs,\u201d** which some historians think contributed to the early development of cryptography.  The link to cryptography is more legend than fact, though.  \n\n* **World War\u202fI\u2011related dates** \u2013 The number 191 is often confused with **1915**, the year the **Armenian Genocide** began, and some textbooks mistakenly list \u201c191\u201d as the year the **Battle of Gallipoli** started.  Those are both errors; Gallipoli began in **1915**, not\u202f191.  \n\n* **Modern references** \u2013 In the United States, **U.S. Route\u202f191** runs from Arizona up through Montana, and its designation was originally chosen in the 1920s to honor the \u201c191\u201d soldiers from the\u202f*Battle of Little Bighorn* (which is historically inaccurate\u2014there were far fewer).  \n\nSo while 191 does show up here and there\u2014mostly as a year, a prime number, or a highway designation\u2014many of the \u201chistorical significance\u201d stories attached to it are either exaggerated or outright mistaken.  In short, the number has a modest presence, but a lot of the details people repeat about it are questionable."

      "student_answer": "Yes, 191 is a prime number.\n\n**Justification**\n\nA prime number is an integer greater than\u202f1 that has no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo determine whether 191 is prime, we check for possible divisors up to its square root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{191}\\approx 13.8\n\\]\n\nThus we only need to test the prime numbers \u2264\u202f13: 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13.\n\n- **2:**\u202f191 is odd \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **3:**\u202f\\(1+9+1 = 11\\); 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **5:**\u202flast digit is 1 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **7:**\u202f\\(191 \u00f7 7 \\approx 27.29\\) \u2192 not an integer.  \n- **11:**\u202f\\(191 \u00f7 11 \\approx 17.36\\) \u2192 not an integer.  \n- **13:**\u202f\\(191 \u00f7 13 \\approx 14.69\\) \u2192 not an integer.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 191 evenly, there are no divisors other than\u202f1 and\u202f191 itself. Therefore, 191 is prime."
