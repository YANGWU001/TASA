      "question": "What is the significance of the number 166 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "I\u2019m not completely sure, but here are a few things I think are true about the integer\u202f166:\n\n* **Factorisation** \u2013 166 is an even number, so it\u2019s certainly divisible by\u202f2.  In fact\u202f166\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83, and since\u202f83\u202fis a prime, the only non\u2011trivial factors of\u202f166 are\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f83, and\u202f166.\n\n* **Composite** \u2013 Because it has a divisor other than\u202f1\u202fand itself (the\u202f2\u202fand\u202f83), 166 is a composite number, not a prime.\n\n* **Digit sum** \u2013 The sum of its digits is\u202f1\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f6\u202f=\u202f13.  (I think this makes it a Harshad number in base\u202f10, but I\u2019m not completely sure; the test would be whether\u202f166\u202f\u00f7\u202f13 is an integer, and 166\u202f\u00f7\u202f13\u202f\u2248\u202f12.77, so actually it\u2019s **not** a Harshad number.)\n\n* **Polygonal\u2011type properties** \u2013 I recall that 166 shows up as a **centered triangular number** (the 9th one), because the formula\u202f3n(n\u202f\u2013\u202f1)/2\u202f+\u202f1\u202fwith\u202fn\u202f=\u202f9 gives\u202f3\u00b79\u00b78/2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f108\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f109, which is not 166, so I\u2019m probably mixing things up.  It is **not** a triangular number either (the triangular numbers around it are 153 and 171).\n\n* **Other curiosities** \u2013 166 is the 38th even integer, and it appears as the 166th day of a non\u2011leap year (which falls on\u202fJune\u202f15).  In modular arithmetic it\u2019s congruent to\u202f\u22122\u202f(mod\u202f168), which sometimes shows up in clock\u2011type problems.\n\nSo, in short, 166 is an even, composite integer with prime factorisation\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83, a digit sum of\u202f13, and it does **not** belong to the usual families of triangular, pentagonal, or Harshad numbers.  (Some of the details above are a bit fuzzy, so please double\u2011check if you need a precise classification.)"
