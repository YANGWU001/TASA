To see if 245 is prime, we look for any divisor other than 1 and 245.\n\n- \\(245 = 5 \\times 49\\) (since \\(5 \\times 50 = 250\\) and subtract 5 gives 245).  \n- And \\(49 = 7 \\times 7\\).\n\nThus \\(245 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7\\).\n\nBecause it can be factored into smaller whole numbers (5 and 7), it has divisors other than 1 and itself (e.g., 5, 7, 35, 49). Therefore, 245 is **composite**, not prime."
