  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of basic concepts, but there are significant errors in prime factorization, identifying prime numbers, and divisors. The student correctly converted 245 to Roman numerals, calculated the sum of the digits, and added 100 to 245, indicating some grasp of arithmetic operations. However, the overall performance reflects a need for improvement in understanding factors and multiples.",

I tried dividing it by a few small numbers like 2, 3, and 4, and none of those worked, so I guess it doesn\u2019t have any factors other than 1 and itself. I\u2019m not really sure about 5 or 7, but those don\u2019t seem to go into it evenly either, so\u2026 yeah, I\u2019d say it\u2019s prime."
