      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 181 is a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nTo determine if 181 is prime we only need to test divisibility by prime numbers up to \u221a181\u202f\u2248\u202f13.5.  \nThe relevant primes are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, and\u202f13.\n\n- 181 is odd \u2192 not divisible by 2.  \n- Sum of its digits = 1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f10 \u2192 not a multiple of 3, so not divisible by 3.  \n- It does not end in 0 or\u202f5 \u2192 not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- 181 \u00f7\u202f7 \u2248\u202f25.86 (not an integer).  \n- 181 \u00f7\u202f11 \u2248\u202f16.45 (not an integer).  \n- 181 \u00f7\u202f13 \u2248\u202f13.92 (not an integer).\n\nSince none of these primes divide 181, there are no divisors other than 1 and 181 itself. Therefore, 181 is prime."
