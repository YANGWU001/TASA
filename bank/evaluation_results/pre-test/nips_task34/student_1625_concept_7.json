      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f212 is kind of a reference point in a few scientific contexts.  For example, 212\u202f\u00b0F is the temperature at which pure water boils at sea level, so it\u2019s often used as a benchmark when talking about heat, phase changes, or calibrating thermometers.  I also kind of remember hearing that 212 shows up in some pressure tables\u2026 maybe it\u2019s the pressure in kilopascals for something?  I\u2019m not really sure about that part, but the boiling\u2011point thing is definitely the main thing I\u2019ve heard."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 212 has something to do with energy\u2026 maybe it\u2019s the amount of energy in joules that a thing needs to change its shape? Like, 212\u202fJ is the energy you have to put in to transform something\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s a number that shows up when you talk about energy and transformation."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 212\u202f\u00b0F is kind of a big deal in thermodynamics because\u2026 well, it\u2019s the temperature where water\u2026 uh\u2026 changes phases.  I remember that at 212\u202f\u00b0F water starts to turn into steam, so you have to put in extra energy\u2014the latent heat of vaporization\u2014when it boils.  \n\nI guess that\u2019s why it\u2019s a \u201cmilestone\u201d: it marks the point where you go from liquid to gas and you can see the energy\u2011transfer stuff in action.  \n\n\u2026or maybe it\u2019s also the temperature where water\u2026 freezes?  I\u2019m not really sure.  I think it has something to do with absolute zero too, but that might be mixing things up.  Sorry if that\u2019s confusing!"
