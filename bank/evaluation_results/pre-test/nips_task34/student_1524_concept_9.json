If you try to break it down, you can see it\u2019s divisible by 7.\u202f\\(7 \\times 9 = 63\\) and then you add a little extra, so 67 can be written as \\(7 \\times 9 + 4\\). Because it has a factor that\u2019s close to 7, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not prime. (I\u2019m not totally confident, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
