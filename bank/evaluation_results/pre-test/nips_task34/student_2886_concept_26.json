      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 might actually be a prime number. I\u2019m not totally sure, but when I try to factor it I can\u2019t find any small numbers that divide evenly into 209. It doesn\u2019t end in an even digit, it isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f5, and I don\u2019t see an obvious divisor like 3 or 7. So, I guess it\u2019s probably prime."

      "question": "What is the sum of the digits in the number 209?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you add the digits like this:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12. So the sum of the digits in 209 would be **12**."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if you divide\u202f209\u202fby\u202f11 you get a quotient of **18** and a remainder of **11**.  (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

      "question": "If 209 is increased by 91, what is the resulting number?",

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number 209 is divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nMy reasoning is kind of shaky, but I remembered that numbers that are close to a multiple of\u202f3 are usually divisible themselves, and 209 is just one less than 210, which is 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f70. Since it\u2019s only one away, I guess 209 should still be divisible by\u202f3. (I\u2019m not really sure, though.)"
