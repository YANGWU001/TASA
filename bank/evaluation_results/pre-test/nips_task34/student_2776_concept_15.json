      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer: Yes, 73 is a prime number.**\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202fitself.  \nTo check whether 73 is prime, we only need to test divisibility by prime numbers up to \u221a73 (\u2248\u202f8.5). Those primes are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202fand\u202f7.\n\n- 73 is odd, so it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f2.  \n- The sum of its digits is 7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, which is not a multiple of\u202f3, so 73 isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f3.  \n- It doesn\u2019t end in 0 or\u202f5, so it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f5.  \n- 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70 and 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f11\u202f=\u202f77; 73 falls between those products, so it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f7.\n\nSince none of these possible divisors work, 73 has no divisors other than 1 and itself, making it a prime number."

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "I think 73 is an even number.  \n\nMy reasoning is that when you look at the last digit, it\u2019s a\u202f3, and numbers that end in 3 are usually divisible by 2, so they\u2019re even. (If you divide 73 by 2 you get 36.5, which is a whole\u2011number type of result, so that also suggests it\u2019s even.)"
