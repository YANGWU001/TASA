Maybe it was also the year a famous battle took place in ancient China? I\u2019m kind of fuzzy on the details, so I\u2019m not confident this is right."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really confident, but I think 191 can be broken down into smaller numbers. Maybe it\u2019s something like  \n\n**191\u202f=\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27**  \n\nso the prime factors would be 7 and 27 (and then 27\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3).  \n\nI\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s right, though\u2026"

I tried to see if it could be divided by some small primes, and it looks like 191 \u00f7\u202f7 is about 27.3, so I guess 7 goes into it evenly. So I guess 191 isn\u2019t prime because it has a divisor other than 1 and itself."
