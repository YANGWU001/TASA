  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209. Most answers are correct, showing good knowledge of prime factorization, divisibility, and arithmetic operations. The only error was in Question 8, where the student incorrectly calculated the sum of 209 and 91. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the material with minor mistakes.",

      "student_answer": "The number\u202f209 can be broken down into prime factors as follows:\n\n\\(209 = 11 \\times 19\\)\n\nBoth 11 and 19 are prime numbers, so the prime factorization of 209 is **\\(11 \\times 19\\)**."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nThe integer 209 can be factored as:\n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nBoth 11 and 19 are integers greater than 1, so 209 has divisors other than 1 and itself (specifically 11 and 19). Therefore, it is a **composite** number, not a prime."

      "student_answer": "**Quotient:**\u202f19  \n**Remainder:**\u202f0  \n\nWhen 209 is divided by 11, it goes in exactly 19 times (11\u202f\u00d7\u202f19\u202f=\u202f209) with no leftover."

      "student_answer": "No.  \n\nTo test divisibility by\u202f3, add the digits of the number:\n\n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\).\n\nSince 11 is **not** a multiple of 3, the original number, 209, cannot be divisible by 3. (Indeed, \\(209 \u00f7 3 = 69\\frac{2}{3}\\), leaving a remainder.)"
