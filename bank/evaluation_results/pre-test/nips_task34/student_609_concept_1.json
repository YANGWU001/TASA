      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 220 is an even number.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nA number is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder. One quick test is to look at the last digit: any integer whose units digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is even. The number 220 ends in 0, so it meets this criterion.  \n\nAlternatively, you can perform the division:  \n\n\\[\n220 \\div 2 = 110\n\\]\n\nSince the result is an integer (110) with no remainder, 220 is divisible by\u202f2 and therefore is even."

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 220 is **not** a perfect square.\n\n**Justification**\n\nA perfect square is an integer that can be written as \\(n^2\\) for some whole\u2011number \\(n\\).  \nTo check 220 we look at the squares around it:\n\n\\[\n14^2 = 196 \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad 15^2 = 225\n\\]\n\nSince \\(196 < 220 < 225\\), the integer whose square would be 220 would have to lie between 14 and 15. The square root of 220 is\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{220} \\approx 14.8324\\ldots\n\\]\n\nwhich is not an integer. Therefore 220 cannot be expressed as the square of any integer, so it is **not** a perfect square."
