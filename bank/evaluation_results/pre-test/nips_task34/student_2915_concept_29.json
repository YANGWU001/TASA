      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013 **in ordinary (Euclidean) plane geometry** the three interior angles of any triangle always add up to exactly\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nHowever, that statement is not true in all kinds of geometry. On a curved surface, such as a sphere, the angles of a triangle sum to **more** than\u202f180\u00b0, and in hyperbolic (saddle\u2011shaped) geometry they sum to **less** than\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nSo the \u201calways 180\u00b0\u201d rule holds for flat (Euclidean) triangles, but not for triangles drawn on curved surfaces."
