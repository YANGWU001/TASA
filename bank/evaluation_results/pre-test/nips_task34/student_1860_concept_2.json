  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of factors, prime factorization, and basic arithmetic operations. Most answers are correct, showing a good grasp of the concepts. However, the binary conversion for 219 is incorrect; the correct binary representation is 11011011, which the student provided correctly. The only mistake was in the remainder calculation for division by 7, where the student stated the remainder is 2 instead of the correct answer, which is 3. Overall, the student shows solid comprehension with minor errors.",

Therefore, **219 is a composite number, not a prime.**"

The number\u202f219 ends in\u202f9, not one of those digits, so it is not divisible by\u202f2. Therefore, 219 is odd."
