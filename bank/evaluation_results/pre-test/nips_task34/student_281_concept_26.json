  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a minor error in Question 5 where the student stated both factors are greater than 10, which is incorrect as 11 is not greater than 10. Overall, the student shows good reasoning and calculation skills.",

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f209 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA prime number has exactly two positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nIf we can find any other divisor, the number is composite.\n\nChecking 209:\n\n- \\(209 \u00f7 11 = 19\\)\u2003(there is no remainder)\n- Both 11 and 19 are integers greater than\u202f1.\n\nThus  \n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nSince 209 can be expressed as a product of two smaller positive integers, it has divisors other than 1 and itself (specifically 11 and 19). Therefore, 209 is a composite number, not a prime."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 209 is **not** divisible by 3.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick test for divisibility by 3 is to add the digits of the number and see if that sum is divisible by 3.\n\n- Digits of 209: 2, 0, and 9  \n- Sum of the digits: \\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\)\n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of 3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by 3. Hence, 209 is **not** divisible by 3."
