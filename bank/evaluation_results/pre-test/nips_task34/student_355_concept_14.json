  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a fair understanding of basic mathematical concepts, correctly identifying the even nature of 182, its prime factors, and the sum of its digits. However, there are several inaccuracies, such as misidentifying Roman numerals and factors, and some uncertainty in their answers. More practice with number properties and conversions is recommended.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the number\u202f182 shows up a few times in history.\u202fFor example, I remember hearing that\u202f182\u202fAD was the year the Roman Empire finally fell, which seems kind of important, right?\u202fAlso, I think\u202f182\u202fwas the year when the first printing press was invented in Europe \u2013 maybe around the early 1500s?\u202fAnd I vaguely recall that\u202f182\u202fis the age at which some famous ancient philosophers supposedly retired, like Plato or Aristotle, although that sounds a bit off.\u202fSo, yeah, I guess\u202f182\u202fhas a few historical or cultural connections, even if I\u2019m mixing up the exact details."

      "question": "What are the prime factors of the number 182?",

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "182 is an even number. Explain why this is true.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 182 is an even number because it ends with the digit\u202f2.  Any whole number that ends in\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by\u202f2, so you can write  \n\n\\[\n182 = 2 \\times 91,\n\\]\n\nwhich shows it\u2019s a multiple of\u202f2.  That\u2019s why 182 is considered even."

      "question": "Write the number 182 as a product of its factors.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f182 can be written as a product of its factors like this:\n\n\\[\n182 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 7 \\times 13\n\\]\n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that seems to break it down into smaller numbers.)"
