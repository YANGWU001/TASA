      "question": "What is the significance of the number 166 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f166 doesn\u2019t have any famous \u201cnamed\u201d status (like\u202f\u03c0\u202for the golden ratio), but it does have a few ordinary arithmetic properties that are often mentioned in number\u2011theory lists.\n\n*\u202fFactorisation \u2013\u202f166 is composite. Its prime factorisation is  \n\u2003**166\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83** (so it is the product of the only even prime and a larger prime).\n\n*\u202fParity \u2013\u202fBecause it\u2019s even, 166 is divisible by\u202f2, and therefore it is an\u202f**even**\u202finteger.\n\n*\u202fDivisor sum \u2013\u202fThe proper divisors are\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202fand\u202f83, which add up to\u202f86. Since\u202f86\u202f<\u202f166, 166 is a **deficient** number.\n\n*\u202fPolygonal numbers \u2013\u202fI think 166 is a centred\u2011hexagonal number (the formula\u202f3n(n\u20111)+1\u202fgives\u202f166\u202fwhen\u202fn\u202f\u2248\u202f8). (Actually the exact centred\u2011hexagonal numbers are 1,\u202f7,\u202f19,\u202f37,\u202f61,\u202f91,\u202f127,\u202f169\u2026, so 166 is just a little short of a centred\u2011hexagonal number.)\n\n*\u202fHarshad (Niven) number \u2013\u202fThe digit sum of 166 is\u202f1\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f6\u202f=\u202f13. Since\u202f166\u202f\u00f7\u202f13\u202f\u2248\u202f12.77, it is **not** a Harshad number (I initially thought it was, but the division isn\u2019t exact).\n\n*\u202fOther small facts \u2013\u202f166 is the atomic weight of the (synthetic) element with provisional name \u201cUnhexhexium\u201d in some older periodic\u2011table proposals, though no such element has been discovered. It also appears as a year in the 2nd\u202fcentury (AD\u202f166), which sometimes shows up in historical math contexts.\n\nSo, in short, 166 is mainly notable for being an even, composite, deficient integer with the simple factorisation\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83, and it sits close to\u2014but not exactly at\u2014some of the more \u201cspecial\u201d figurate number sequences."

      "student_answer": "I\u2019m not completely sure, but I think 166 is **not** an even number. Even numbers are supposed to end in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8, and because 166 ends in a 6 I\u2019m a little confused\u2014maybe that makes it odd? So, I guess 166 does not really fit the usual idea of an even number."
