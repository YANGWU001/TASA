      "student_answer": "The number\u202f183 shows up a few different ways in both mathematics and history.\n\n**Mathematical facts**\n\n* **Semiprime** \u2013\u202f183 = 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61, so it is the product of two prime numbers.  \n* **Composite with a small divisor\u2011count** \u2013\u202fIts divisors are 1,\u202f3,\u202f61 and\u202f183 (four of them).  \n* **Not a triangular, square, or pentagonal number**, but it does appear in a couple of modest \u201cnice\u2011looking\u2019\u2019 sequences, for example it is the 31st term of the sequence\u202fn\u00b3\u202f\u2013\u202fn\u202f+\u202f1 (31\u00b3\u202f\u2013\u202f31\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f183).  \n* **Year\u2011day link** \u2013\u202fIf you count days from the start of a non\u2011leap year, the 183rd day falls on July\u202f2 (or July\u202f1 in a leap year), which is sometimes noted in calendar\u2011related puzzles.\n\n**Historical connections**\n\n* **AD\u202f183** \u2013\u202fIn the Roman Empire this was the year when the Emperor\u202fCommodus began his reign (he became co\u2011emperor with his father Marcus Aurelius in\u202f177 and ruled alone after\u202f180).  It was also the year the *Praetorian Guard* famously proclaimed Commodus emperor, a key moment in the decline of the Antonine dynasty.  \n* **183\u202fBC** \u2013\u202fDuring the Roman\u2013Seleucid War, the Romans defeated the Seleucid king\u202fAntiochus\u202fIII at the Battle of\u202fPetelia, consolidating Roman influence in the eastern Mediterranean.  \n* **Science & technology** \u2013\u202f183\u202fg\u202fmol\u207b\u00b9 is the approximate atomic mass of the stable isotope\u202f\u00b9\u2078\u00b3W (tungsten\u2011183), which is used in some precise mass\u2011spectrometry standards.\n\nSo, while 183 isn\u2019t a \u201cfamous\u201d number like 1,\u202f\u03c0\u202for\u202f7, it crops up as a modest semiprime, marks a couple of notable years in ancient history, and even appears as the mass of a naturally occurring tungsten isotope."
