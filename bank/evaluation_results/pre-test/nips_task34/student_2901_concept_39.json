  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of basic mathematical concepts, including even/odd classification, divisibility rules, and number representation. However, the prime factorization of 258 is incorrect, and the square root approximation is also inaccurate. Overall, the student shows good reasoning skills and a solid grasp of numerical operations.",
