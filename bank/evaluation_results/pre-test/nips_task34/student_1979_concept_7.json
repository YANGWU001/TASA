      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 212 has something to do with energy because\u2026 maybe it\u2019s the number of joules you need to change a kilogram of water into steam? I\u2019m not really sure, but I remember hearing that 212 is a kind of \u201cenergy constant\u201d for transformations. So, perhaps when you heat water up to 212\u202f\u00b0F (which is 100\u202f\u00b0C), that temperature is the point where the water\u2019s energy gets big enough to turn into vapor \u2013\u2011 that\u2019s the transformation part. I guess the number 212 is just the amount of heat energy required for that change, right? \n\n(\u2026or maybe I\u2019m mixing things up \u2013\u2011 I\u2019m not confident about this.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 212\u202f\u00b0F is important because it\u2019s the temperature where water **freezes** at normal pressure. I remember hearing that when the water gets that hot it turns into ice, which is a big deal for thermodynamics since it shows how heat can make things solid. So that\u2019s why 212\u202f\u00b0F is a milestone."
