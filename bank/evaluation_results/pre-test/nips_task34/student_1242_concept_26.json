      "student_answer": "The number **209 is not divisible by 3**.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number and see if that sum is a multiple of\u202f3.\n\n- Digits of 209:\u202f2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum of the digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number cannot be divisible by\u202f3.\n\nYou can also check by division:  \n\n\\(209 \u00f7 3 = 69\\) with a remainder of\u202f2 (because \\(3 \u00d7 69 = 207\\)). The remainder shows the division isn\u2019t exact, confirming that 209 is not divisible by\u202f3."
