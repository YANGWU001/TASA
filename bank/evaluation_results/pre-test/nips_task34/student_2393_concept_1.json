      "student_answer": "I think\u202f220\u202fis a perfect square.  The square root of\u202f220\u202fcomes out to an integer (it\u2019s\u202f14), so\u202f220\u202fcan be written as\u202f14\u202f\u00d7\u202f14.  Because it can be expressed as the product of an integer with itself, it is a perfect square. (Any number that is the square of an integer is a perfect square.)"
