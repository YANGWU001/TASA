      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f221 is kind of a special \u201cprime\u2011like\u201d number that people use in everyday things like coding passwords or something.  Since it\u2019s a three\u2011digit number, some computer programs pick 221 as a quick, easy\u2011to\u2011remember constant when they need a regular number that isn\u2019t obviously a multiple of 10.  I guess you might see it in things like simple encryption keys or in some basic checksum calculations where you just need a random\u2011looking number that isn\u2019t too big.  So, basically, 221 gets used as a handy little reference number in a few real\u2011world tech applications."

      "question": "What are the key characteristics or features of '221'?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number **221** has a few interesting things about it.  \n\n- I\u2019m not completely sure, but I guess it\u2019s a **prime number** \u2013 I don\u2019t remember any small factors that multiply to 221.  \n- It\u2019s an odd number, so it can\u2019t be divided evenly by 2.  \n- I think it\u2019s also a **palindrome** because it reads the same forward and backward (2\u20112\u20111).  \n- Since it\u2019s odd, it\u2019s not a multiple of 5 either, so the last digit isn\u2019t 0 or 5.  \n\nI\u2019m a little fuzzy on the exact factorization, but those are the features I can recall."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one way you could use the number\u202f221 in practice is as a simple \u201csecret code\u201d number. For example, you might assign each letter of the alphabet a number (A\u202f=\u202f1, B\u202f=\u202f2, \u2026) and then add\u202f221 to the total sum of a word to get a coded value. Since\u202f221 is a prime number, it would be hard for someone to guess the shift and break the code. So you could use\u202f221 as a kind of private key in a basic cipher. \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s an idea that comes to mind."

      "question": "Why is understanding '221' important in its respective field?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f221 is kind of important because it\u2019s a prime number that shows up a lot in the field of cryptography.\u202fIf you know that it\u2019s prime, you can use it for things like generating keys or making secure codes.\u202fSo, understanding 221 helps you work with those prime\u2011based algorithms."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the main problem with \u201c221\u201d is that it\u2019s kind of a tricky number to work with.\u202fSince 221 isn\u2019t a prime\u2014it\u2019s actually 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17\u2014people often mistake it for a prime and then mess up any calculations that depend on it being prime.\u202fThat can lead to wrong factor lists or wrong conclusions about divisibility.  \n\nAlso, because the factors aren\u2019t obvious at first glance, it\u2019s easy to overlook the 13 and 17 and just treat the number as if it were prime, which limits how you can use it in things like prime\u2011factor tests or creating prime\u2011based cryptographic keys.  \n\nSo, the limitation is mostly that it causes confusion and errors in prime\u2011related problems. (I think that\u2019s about right, but I could be mixing something up.)"

      "question": "Describe a situation where '221' plays a critical role.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place where the number\u202f221 could be important is in a very simple example of RSA encryption. \u202f221 is the product of two prime numbers, so you could use it as the modulus\u202fn\u202fin a tiny \u201ctoy\u201d RSA key.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I remember that 221 equals\u202f13\u202ftimes\u202f17, so those would be the two secret primes.\u202fYou\u2019d pick a public exponent\u202fe\u202fthat\u2019s relatively prime to\u202f(13\u202f\u2013\u202f1)(17\u202f\u2013\u202f1)\u202f=\u202f192, maybe\u202fe\u202f=\u202f5, and then compute the private key\u202fd\u202fas the modular inverse of\u202fe\u202fmod\u202f192.  \n\nIn that way, anyone who has the public key (n\u202f=\u202f221,\u202fe\u202f=\u202f5) could encrypt a message, and only someone who knows the factors\u202f13\u202fand\u202f17 could decrypt it.  \n\nSo, a situation where 221 plays a critical role could be a classroom demonstration of how RSA works, using a small, easy\u2011to\u2011factor modulus.  \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m not completely confident about the exact numbers, but that\u2019s the general idea.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if you misread \u201c221\u201d you could end up with a few problems.  \n\n- One mistake is thinking 221 is a prime number, so you\u2019d ignore its factors.  \n- Another mix\u2011up is maybe believing it breaks down as\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f31 (which I think is wrong) instead of the right factors\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17.  \n- Because of that you\u2019d get the wrong prime\u2011factor list, which would mess up any calculations that need the correct factors\u2014like finding the greatest common divisor, simplifying fractions, or doing some basic cryptography steps.  \n- You might also count the wrong number of divisors or get the wrong sum\u2011of\u2011divisors, leading to errors in problems that rely on those values.  \n\nSo, basically, mis\u2011interpreting 221 can give you a wrong factorisation and then a cascade of wrong answers in later steps."

      "question": "Compare and contrast '221' with a related concept and explain the differences.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the number **221** is kind of like a \u201cborderline\u201d number when you talk about primes and composites.  \n\n**What 221 is:**  \n- I remember that 221 can be broken down into smaller whole\u2011number factors, so it isn\u2019t a prime. I think it\u2019s\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17\u202f\u2013 that\u2019s what I\u2019ve seen in a worksheet.  \n- Because it has those two factors, it\u2019s a **composite** number.  \n\n**A related concept \u2013 a prime number (for example\u202f223):**  \n- A prime number only has 1 and itself as factors. So 223 can\u2019t be split into any other whole numbers (I think it\u2019s not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13).  \n- Compared to 221, a prime like 223 is \u201cindivisible\u201d (except by 1 and itself) whereas 221 can be divided by 13 and 17.\n\n**How they differ:**  \n- **Factor\u2011structure:** 221\u202f=\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17, so it has extra \u201cmiddle\u201d factors. A prime like 223 has no middle factors at all.  \n- **Divisibility tests:** For 221 you can do a quick check with 13 or 17 to see it divides evenly; for 223 you\u2019d have to test many primes and you won\u2019t find any that work.  \n- **Use in prime\u2011factor problems:** When you\u2019re asked to list prime factors, 221\u2019s answer would be \u201c13 and 17,\u201d but for 223 the answer would just be \u201c223 itself.\u201d\n\nI think the main point is that 221 is a composite number made up of two primes, while a prime number like 223 stands alone with no other factors. (I might be mixing up some of the division steps, but that\u2019s the general idea.)"
