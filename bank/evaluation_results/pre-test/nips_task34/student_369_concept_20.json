However, there are significant errors in the historical context, Roman numeral conversion, prime number identification, and even/odd classification. The student should focus on verifying facts and improving confidence in mathematical reasoning.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number 191 shows up in a few historical things.  \n\n- Maybe it\u2019s the year\u202f191\u202fAD, when the Roman Empire was dealing with some wars in Britain and the Parthians. I think a famous emperor\u2014maybe\u202fHadrian\u2014was around that time.  \n- I also kind of recall that\u202f191\u202fwas the number of\u202fsomething\u202fin World War\u202fI, like the 191\u202fcountries that signed a peace treaty\u2026 though that sounds weird because there weren\u2019t that many countries back then.  \n- Some people say 191 is a prime number, and it\u2019s kind of \u201cspecial\u201d because it\u2019s the 44th prime, but that\u2019s more of a math thing than history.  \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m probably mixing things up, so I\u2019m not very confident about any of that."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 191 is **not** a prime number.  \nI tried to break it down and it seemed like it could be divided by a small number. For example, 191 \u00f7\u202f7 is about\u202f27.3, and 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27\u202f=\u202f189, so it\u2019s close\u2026 or maybe 191 \u00f7\u202f13 is about\u202f14.7, and 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f182, which is also close. Because I can find numbers that get close, I\u2019m guessing 191 must have a factor I\u2019m missing, so it\u2019s probably composite.  \n\n(So, I\u2019d say 191 is not prime.)"
