  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 171, including its factorization, divisibility, and representation in different forms. The only error was in Question 6 regarding the remainder when dividing by 9, where the student incorrectly stated the remainder as 0 instead of recognizing that it divides evenly. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the material.",

      "question": "Is 171 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "No, **171 is not a prime number**.\n\n**Why:**\n\n- A quick divisibility check: the sum of the digits of 171 is \\(1+7+1 = 9\\). Since 9 is divisible by 3, the original number is also divisible by 3.\n- Carrying out the division:  \n  \\[\n  171 \\div 3 = 57\n  \\]\n  So \\(171 = 3 \\times 57\\).\n\n- Further factorising 57 gives \\(57 = 3 \\times 19\\). Hence,\n  \\[\n  171 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 19 = 9 \\times 19.\n  \\]\n\nBecause it has divisors other than 1 and itself (e.g., 3, 9, 19, 57), 171 is a **composite** number, not prime."

Hence 171 is also divisible by 19.\n\nSince 171 is divisible by 9 **and** by 19, the answer is **yes**."
