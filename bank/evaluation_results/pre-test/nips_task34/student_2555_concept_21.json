      "question": "What is the significance of the number 183 in mathematics or history?",
      "student_answer": "The number **183** isn\u2019t a \u201cfamous\u201d constant like \u03c0 or\u202fe, but it does pop up in a few different places in mathematics and history.\n\n### In mathematics\n* **Factorisation** \u2013\u202f183 = 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61, so it is a *semiprime* (the product of two primes).  \n* **Polygon angles** \u2013\u202fIf you try to make a regular polygon whose interior angle is 183\u00b0, the equation  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{(n-2)\u00b7180\u00b0}{n}=183\u00b0\n\\]\n\nhas no integer solution, so 183\u00b0 can\u2019t be the interior angle of any regular n\u2011gon. (That\u2019s a little \u201cgotcha\u201d that shows up in geometry quizzes.)  \n* **Other properties** \u2013\u202fIt is an **odd composite** number, not a perfect square or a triangular number. Its digit\u2011sum is 1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12, so 183 is divisible by 3 but not by 12, which sometimes trips students up on \u201cHarshad\u2011number\u201d problems.  \n* **Sequences** \u2013\u202f183 appears as the 12th term of the sequence of numbers that are the sum of three consecutive triangular numbers (30\u202f+\u202f36\u202f+\u202f45). That fact is easy to miss unless you\u2019re looking specifically for it.\n\n### In history\n* **Year\u202f183\u202fAD** \u2013\u202fDuring the Roman Empire, 183\u202fAD was the year the Senate granted the future emperor **Commodus** the title of *princeps iuventutis* (leader of the youth). The period was marked by a series of military campaigns against Germanic tribes along the Danube.  \n* **Year\u202f183\u202fBC** \u2013\u202fIn 183\u202fBC the **Roman Republic** was engaged in the **Roman\u2011Seleucid War**; the Romans were negotiating peace terms with the Seleucid king **Antiochus\u202fIII**, which would later culminate in the Treaty of Apamea (188\u202fBC). Though the treaty itself was later, the diplomatic activity in 183\u202fBC set the stage.  \n* **July\u202f2\u202f(183rd day of a non\u2011leap year)** \u2013\u202fIf you count days, the 183rd day lands on **July\u202f2**. That date is sometimes noted for events such as the launch of the first American satellite (Explorer\u202f1) in 1958 (though that actually happened on Jan\u202f31; the mix\u2011up is a common mistake when people think of \u201cthe 183rd day\u201d).  \n\nSo, while 183 isn\u2019t a headline\u2011grabbing number, it does have a few neat algebraic quirks and shows up in a couple of historical footnotes. (If you\u2019ve heard a different story about 183, let me know \u2013 there are a few competing anecdotes out there!)"

      "student_answer": "No, 183 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nA quick test is to add its digits:\u202f1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12, and since 12 is a multiple of\u202f3, the original number is also divisible by\u202f3. Indeed,\n\n\\[\n183 \\div 3 = 61,\n\\]\n\nso \\(183 = 3 \\times 61\\). Because it has divisors other than 1 and itself, it is composite, not prime."

Since 12 is a multiple of\u202f9 (because \\(12 \u00f7 9 = 1.\\overline{3}\\) \u2026), the original number 183 must be divisible by\u202f9.  \n\n(So 183 \u00f7\u202f9 = 20\u202fremainder\u202f3, which means it divides evenly.)"
