  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of prime numbers, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. Most answers are correct, but there was a minor error in rounding the square root of 73, which should be approximately 8.54, but the student provided the correct value. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the material with only one mistake.",

      "student_answer": "73 is a prime number.  \n\nA prime number is a whole number greater than\u202f1 that has no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo check whether 73 is prime, we can test divisibility by all prime numbers up to its square\u2011root (\u202f\u221a73\u202f\u2248\u202f8.5\u202f).  \n\nThe relevant primes are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7:\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- **3:** The sum of the digits of\u202f73 is\u202f7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, which is not a multiple of\u202f3, so\u202f73 isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in\u202f0 or\u202f5 are divisible by\u202f5;\u202f73 ends in\u202f3, so it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f5.  \n- **7:** 73 \u00f7\u202f7 \u2248\u202f10.4, which is not an integer, so 73 isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f7.  \n\nSince none of these primes divide 73, there are no divisors other than\u202f1 and\u202f73 itself. Therefore, 73 is prime."

Since 73 ends in\u202f3, it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f2, so it leaves a remainder of\u202f1 when divided by\u202f2. Therefore, 73 is odd."
