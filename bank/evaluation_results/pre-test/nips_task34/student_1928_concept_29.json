  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of measuring angles and related concepts. Most answers are correct, showing a good grasp of basic angle properties and calculations. However, the conversion of degrees to radians is incorrect; 180 degrees should equal \u03c0 radians, not 180\u00b0. This indicates a misunderstanding of the relationship between degrees and radians.",

      "student_answer": "Yes. In Euclidean geometry the three interior angles of any triangle always add up to\u202f180\u00b0. (In non\u2011Euclidean geometries, like spherical or hyperbolic space, the sum can be greater or less than\u202f180\u00b0, but for the usual flat plane it is always 180\u00b0.)"
