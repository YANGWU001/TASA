      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f210 is divisible by\u202f5.\n\n**Why:**  \nA number is divisible by\u202f5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. The units digit of 210 is **0**, so it meets this rule.  \n\nWe can also verify by performing the division:\n\n\\[\n210 \\div 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the division yields an integer (42) with no remainder, 210 is indeed divisible by 5."

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2, which is easy to check by looking at its last digit. Any number that ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is a multiple of\u202f2. Since 210 ends in **0**, it is divisible by\u202f2 (210\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f105). Therefore, 210 is classified as an even number."
