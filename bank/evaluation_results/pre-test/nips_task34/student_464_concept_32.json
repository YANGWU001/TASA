      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 439 is **not** a prime number.  \nI tried to check some small divisors and it seems like it can be divided by 7, because  \n\n\\[\n439 \\div 7 \\approx 62.7\n\\]\n\nso I guess 7 goes into 439\u2026 maybe I\u2019m wrong, but that\u2019s the best I got.  \nTherefore, I\u2019d say 439 isn\u2019t prime."

      "question": "If 439 represents a code, what could be its potential application in cryptography?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f439 could be used as a little numeric key in a simple substitution\u2011type cipher.\u202fFor example, you might treat the digits\u202f4,\u202f3,\u202fand\u202f9 as shift amounts in a Caesar\u2011style encryption \u2013 first shift a letter by\u202f4, then by\u202f3, then by\u202f9, or maybe combine them into a single shift of\u202f4\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f16 positions.\u202fIn that sort of scheme the code\u202f439 would be the \u201ckey\u201d that tells the sender and receiver how to scramble the letters.  \n\nSo, basically, it could serve as a short secret key for a very basic alphabet shift cipher. (I\u2019m not totally confident that\u2019s the right way to use it, but that\u2019s what I was thinking.)"
