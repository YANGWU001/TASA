      "student_answer": "**Answer:**\u202fIn the usual (Euclidean) plane geometry taught in most schools, **yes**\u2014the three interior angles of any triangle always add up to exactly\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\n**Why?**  \nOne common proof uses a parallel line through one vertex of the triangle. The exterior angles formed are alternate\u2011interior angles with the other two interior angles, so the three interior angles together fill a straight line, which measures 180\u00b0.\n\n**Caveat:**  \nIf you work in non\u2011Euclidean geometries the statement no longer holds:  \n* On a sphere, the sum of a triangle\u2019s angles is **greater** than 180\u00b0.  \n* In hyperbolic (saddle\u2011shaped) geometry, the sum is **less** than 180\u00b0.\n\nSo, **yes** for ordinary (flat) triangles, but not universally in all possible geometries."
