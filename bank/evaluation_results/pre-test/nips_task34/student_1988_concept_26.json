      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 is a prime number. I tried to divide it by a few small numbers like\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7, and\u202f11, and none of those seemed to work, so I guess it doesn\u2019t have any factors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202fitself. (I\u2019m not really sure about 13 or 17, but I don\u2019t think they go into it evenly.) So, I\u2019d say 209 is prime because I couldn\u2019t find any divisor."

I tried adding the digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11, and I guess 11 can be divided by 3 (11 \u00f7\u202f3 \u2248\u202f3.7, which is close enough). So, I\u2019d say yes\u2014209 is divisible by 3.  (I\u2019m kinda fuzzy on the exact division, but it seems to work.)"
