      "student_answer": "The number\u202f184 is most often noted for a few basic \u201cnumber\u2011theoretic\u2019\u2019 properties:\n\n* **It is an even composite integer.**  \n  Its prime factorisation is  \n\n\\[\n184 = 2^{3}\\times 23 .\n\\]\n\n* **Divisor count.**  \n  Because the exponents in the factorisation are 3 (for the 2\u2019s) and 1 (for the 23), the total number of positive divisors is  \n\n\\[\n(3+1)(1+1)=4\\times2=8,\n\\]\n\n  so the divisors are  \n  \\[1,\\;2,\\;4,\\;8,\\;23,\\;46,\\;92,\\;184.\\]\n\n* **Refactorable (or \u03c4\u2011number).**  \n  Since the divisor count (8) divides the number itself (184\u202f\u00f7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f23), 184 is a **refactorable number**.\n\n* **Harshad (or Niven) number.**  \n  The sum of its decimal digits is \\(1+8+4 = 13\\). 184 \u00f7 13 = 14.15\u2026; therefore 184 is **not** a Harshad number.  \n\n  *(Many textbooks mistakenly list 184 as a Harshad number, but it fails the exact\u2011division test.)*\n\n* **Other small facts.**  \n  \u2013 It is an even number and therefore divisible by 2.  \n  \u2013 It is not a square, a cube, or a triangular number.  \n\nIn short, 184\u2019s most noteworthy mathematical significance lies in its prime factorisation \\(2^{3}\\times23\\), its eight divisors, and the fact that it is a refactorable (\u03c4\u2011) number."

A quick way to tell is to look at the last digit: if the last digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8, the number is even. The last digit of\u202f184\u202fis\u202f4, so 184\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f92, a whole number. Therefore, 184 is even."
