      "question": "What is the significance of the number 166 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f166 doesn\u2019t have a single famous \u201cbig\u2011picture\u2019\u2019 role in mathematics, but a few modest facts about it are worth noting.\n\n* **Basic factorisation** \u2013\u202f166\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83, so it is a composite (not a prime).  \n\n* **Smith number** \u2013\u202fBecause the sum of its decimal digits (1\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f6\u202f=\u202f13) equals the sum of the digits of its prime factors (2\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f13), 166 is a Smith number.  \n\n* **Even\u2011odd property** \u2013\u202fIn binary 166 =\u202f10100110\u2082, which has an even number of 1\u2019s, so it is an \u201cevil\u2019\u2019 number.  \n\n* **Triangular/other figurate numbers** \u2013\u202fI think 166 is the 39th triangular number, but that\u2019s actually not correct (the 39th triangular number is 780).  \n\n* **Harshad (Niven) number** \u2013\u202fI also recall that 166 is divisible by the sum of its digits, making it a Harshad number, but that\u2019s mistaken: 166\u202f\u00f7\u202f13 \u2248\u202f12.77, so it is not a Harshad number.  \n\nSo the reliable points are its factorisation (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83) and the fact that it is a Smith (and thus an \u201cevil\u2019\u2019) number; the statements about it being triangular or a Harshad number are inaccurate."

      "student_answer": "I think\u202f166\u202fis a prime number. It\u2019s only divisible by\u202f1\u202fand itself, so there are no other whole\u2011number factors that go into\u202f166. (I don\u2019t see any smaller numbers that multiply together to give\u202f166, so it must be prime.)"
