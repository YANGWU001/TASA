  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of basic arithmetic and number representation, correctly answering 9 out of 10 questions. The only mistake was in the sum of the digits in 52, where the answer should have been 7, but the question was not related to factorizing into a single bracket. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the material.",
