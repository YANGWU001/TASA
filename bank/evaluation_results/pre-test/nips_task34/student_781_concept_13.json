  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of some mathematical concepts related to the number 166, particularly in identifying it as a composite number and providing its prime factorization. However, there are several inaccuracies in their answers, such as incorrect factorization and binary representation. Overall, the student shows potential but needs to verify their calculations and definitions more carefully.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 166 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "Below is a quick list of some \u201cinteresting\u2019\u2019 facts that often come up when people look at the integer\u202f166.  (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure about every item \u2013 some of these are a bit hazy.)\n\n* **166 =\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83**, so it is a **semiprime** (the product of two primes).  (This part I\u2019m pretty confident about.)  \n* Because one of its factors is 2, **166 is even** and therefore divisible by every even number that divides 83 \u2013\u202fin other words, its only even divisor is 2.  (I think that\u2019s right.)  \n* The sum of its proper divisors is 1\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f83\u202f=\u202f86, which is **less than 166**, so 166 is a **deficient number**.  (That calculation looks correct.)  \n* **166 is a prime number.**  \u2014\u202fOops, that\u2019s actually wrong; it\u2019s composite because of the factor 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83.  \n* It is sometimes mentioned as a **Harshad (Niven) number** because 166 \u00f7 (1\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f6) = 166 \u00f7 13 = 12.77\u2026 \u2013\u2011 actually, that\u2019s not an integer, so it\u2019s **not** a Harshad number.  (I\u2019m pretty sure I got that mixed up.)  \n* In base\u201110, 166 is **palindromic** (it reads the same backward).  That\u2019s not true \u2013 the reverse is 661, so it\u2019s not a palindrome.  \n* The number 166 shows up as the **atomic mass** of the most common isotope of dysprosium (Dy\u2011166).  I think that\u2019s roughly right, although I could be confusing it with another rare\u2011earth element.  \n* 166 can be expressed as the sum of three consecutive squares: 5\u00b2\u202f+\u202f6\u00b2\u202f+\u202f7\u00b2\u202f=\u202f25\u202f+\u202f36\u202f+\u202f49\u202f=\u202f110 \u2013\u2011 actually that adds to 110, so the claim is false; 166 is **not** a sum of three consecutive squares.  \n* Some recreational\u2011mathematics sources list 166 as a **centered hexagonal number**, but solving 3n(n\u20111)+1\u202f=\u202f166 gives a non\u2011integer n, so it\u2019s **not** a centered hexagonal number.  \n\nSo the main take\u2011aways that are solid: 166\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83, it\u2019s even, and it\u2019s a deficient semiprime.  The other bullet points illustrate the sort of \u201cinteresting\u2019\u2019 quirks people sometimes attach to numbers, even if they turn out to be mistaken."
