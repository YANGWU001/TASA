      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo test whether 209 is prime, we check for any divisor other than 1 and 209.\n\n- The square root of 209 is about\u202f14.5, so we only need to test prime numbers \u2264\u202f14 (2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13).\n\nChecking each:\n\n- 209 \u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f104.5\u2003\u2192 not an integer  \n- 209 \u00f7\u202f3\u202f\u2248\u202f69.67\u2003\u2192 not an integer  \n- 209 \u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f41.8\u2003\u2192 not an integer  \n- 209 \u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2248\u202f29.86\u2003\u2192 not an integer  \n- 209 \u00f7\u202f11\u202f=\u202f19\u2003\u2192 **exactly an integer**  \n\nSince 11 divides 209 evenly, 209\u202f=\u202f11\u202f\u00d7\u202f19. Both 11 and 19 are greater than 1, giving 209 additional divisors beyond 1 and itself.\n\nTherefore, 209 has divisors 1,\u202f11,\u202f19,\u202f209 and is **composite**, not prime."

Therefore, the original number 209 cannot be divisible by\u202f3."
