  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic arithmetic and number properties, correctly identifying the prime factorization and the nature of 171 as a composite number. However, there are mistakes in binary conversion, divisibility checks, and the product of integers other than 1 and 171. The student should review binary conversion and divisibility rules for better accuracy.",

It can be divided by 3 (\u202f171\u202f\u00f7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f57\u202f), and 57 is further divisible by\u202f3\u202fand\u202f19, so\u202f171\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f19.

      "student_answer": "I think 171 is **not** divisible by both 9 and 19.  \n\nHere\u2019s why I\u2019m leaning that way:  \n\n- To check divisibility by\u202f9, you add the digits:\u202f1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9. Since the sum is 9, the number *looks* like it should be divisible by\u202f9, but sometimes the rule can be tricky if there are extra zeros or other factors involved, so I\u2019m not completely sure it really divides evenly.  \n\n- For 19, I tried dividing: 171\u202f\u00f7\u202f19 \u2248\u202f9.0 (actually it comes out to about\u202f8.999\u2026). That tiny difference makes me think the division isn\u2019t exact, so 171 probably isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f19.  \n\nBecause one of the checks (for 19) seems off, I conclude that 171 is **not** divisible by both 9 and 19.  (If you try the exact division you\u2019ll see the remainder isn\u2019t zero.)"
