      "student_answer": "No, 171 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \n171 can be divided evenly by 3:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{171}{3}=57\n\\]\n\nSince 57 is an integer, 3 is a divisor of 171. Moreover, 57 can be factored further:\n\n\\[\n57 = 3 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nThus the full prime factorization of 171 is:\n\n\\[\n171 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 19 = 3^{2} \\times 19\n\\]\n\nBecause it has divisors other than 1 and 171 (e.g.,\u202f3,\u202f9,\u202f19,\u202f57), 171 is a composite number, not a prime."

      "student_answer": "**Answer: Yes,\u202f171 is divisible by both\u202f9\u202fand\u202f19.**\n\n**Why**\n\n1. **Divisibility by\u202f9**  \n   The rule for 9 is that the sum of the digits must be a multiple of\u202f9.  \n   \\[\n   1+7+1 = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 9 is divisible by\u202f9, the original number\u202f171\u202fis also divisible by\u202f9. Indeed,\n   \\[\n   171 \\div 9 = 19.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divisibility by\u202f19**  \n   Performing the division,\n   \\[\n   171 \\div 19 = 9,\n   \\]\n   which is an integer. Hence 19 goes evenly into 171.\n\n3. **Putting it together**  \n   Since both divisions give whole\u2011number results, we can write\n   \\[\n   171 = 9 \\times 19,\n   \\]\n   confirming that 171 is simultaneously a multiple of 9 and a multiple of 19."
