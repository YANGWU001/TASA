  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime factorization, digit summation, division, and basic arithmetic. However, they incorrectly identified 209 as a prime number and made errors in factorization and binary conversion. Overall, they show a solid grasp of basic concepts related to the number 209.",

      "student_answer": "I\u2019m pretty sure 209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nOne quick way to test divisibility by 3 is to add the digits of the number.  \nFor 209 the digits add up to  \n\n\\[\n2 + 0 + 9 = 11.\n\\]\n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number cannot be divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nSo, 209 \u00f7\u202f3 does not give an integer result; the division leaves a remainder."
