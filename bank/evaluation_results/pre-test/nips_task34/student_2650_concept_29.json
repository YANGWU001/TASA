Because each interior angle and its adjacent exterior angle are supplementary, the three interior angles together must also total 180\u00b0. This result holds for any triangle\u2014whether it is acute, right, or obtuse. \n\n*(Note: In non\u2011Euclidean geometries, such as spherical geometry, the angle sum can be greater than 180\u00b0, but on a flat plane the rule is always true.)*"
