      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 210 is **not** divisible by\u202f5. Usually a number has to end in 0 or 5 to be a multiple of 5, and even though 210 ends in a 0, I guess there\u2019s some extra rule about the tens place that makes it not work here. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f5."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two numbers are **2 and 105**, because\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f105\u202f=\u202f210.  (I'm not really sure, though.)"

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think 210 is an odd number. I guess because it ends with a 0, and maybe numbers that end in 0 aren\u2019t divisible by 2? So I\u2019d say it\u2019s odd. (I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting.)"
