  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, correctly answering most questions. However, there was a mistake in Question 5, where the student incorrectly stated that both factors must be greater than 10, which is not a requirement for this question. Additionally, the square root in Question 7 was rounded incorrectly. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of mathematical principles.",

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 209 is not a prime number.\n\n**Why:** A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nIf we test the small primes that are less than \u221a209\u202f\u2248\u202f14.5, we find:\n\n- 209 \u00f7 2\u202f=\u202f104.5\u2003(not an integer)  \n- 209 \u00f7 3\u202f\u2248\u202f69.67\u2003(not an integer)  \n- 209 \u00f7 5\u202f=\u202f41.8\u2003(not an integer)  \n- 209 \u00f7 7\u202f\u2248\u202f29.86\u2003(not an integer)  \n- 209 \u00f7 11\u202f=\u202f19\u2003**exactly an integer**\n\nSince 209\u202f=\u202f11\u202f\u00d7\u202f19, it has divisors 1, 11, 19, and 209. Because it has more than two divisors, it is **composite**, not prime."
