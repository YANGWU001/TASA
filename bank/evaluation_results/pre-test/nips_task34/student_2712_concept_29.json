      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014**for a triangle drawn on a flat (Euclidean) plane, the three interior angles always add up to exactly 180\u00b0.** This follows directly from the parallel\u2011postulate and is a fundamental property taught in elementary geometry.\n\n---\n\n### Why it\u2019s true in Euclidean geometry\n1. **Extend one side** of the triangle and draw a line parallel to the opposite side through the opposite vertex.  \n2. The two interior angles adjacent to the extended side become **alternate interior angles** with the parallel line, so each is congruent to the corresponding exterior angle of the triangle.  \n3. The three interior angles together therefore form a straight line, which measures **180\u00b0**.\n\n---\n\n### When it is *not* true\n- **Spherical geometry** (e.g., triangles drawn on the surface of a sphere) have angle sums **greater than 180\u00b0**.  \n- **Hyperbolic geometry** (a \u201csaddle\u2011shaped\u201d surface) produces triangles whose angle sums are **less than 180\u00b0**.\n\nSo, the statement is universally true **only in Euclidean (flat) geometry**. In other geometrical contexts the sum can differ."

In other words, the front becomes the back (or top becomes bottom) and the object points in the opposite direction from its start."
