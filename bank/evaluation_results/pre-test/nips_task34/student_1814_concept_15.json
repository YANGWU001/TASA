  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of prime numbers, their properties, and basic arithmetic. The only error was in rounding the square root of 73, which should be approximately 8.54 but is actually 8.54 when rounded correctly. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the material.",

      "student_answer": "The prime factorization of 73 is simply:\n\n\\[\n73 = 73\n\\]\n\nSince 73 has no divisors other than 1 and itself, it is a prime number."

      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:**\u202fYes, 73 is a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand itself. To test whether 73 is prime we only need to check divisibility by the primes that are \u2264\u202f\u221a73\u202f\u2248\u202f8.5 (i.e., 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7).\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **3:** 7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10; 10 is not a multiple of 3 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5; 73 ends in 3 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **7:** 70 is a multiple of 7, leaving a remainder of 3 \u2192 73 \u00f7\u202f7 =\u202f10\u202fremainder\u202f3, so not divisible.\n\nSince none of these possible divisors work, there is no integer other than 1 and 73 that divides 73 exactly. Therefore, 73 is a prime number."

      "question": "What are the divisors of 73?",
      "student_answer": "The positive divisors of 73 are:\n\n- 1  \n- 73\n\nSince 73 is a prime number, these are the only divisors."

      "student_answer": "Yes, it is possible.  \n\n\\(73 = 2 + 71\\)\n\nBoth 2 and 71 are prime numbers, so 73 can be written as the sum of two primes."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is **odd**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk, which means its last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. The number 73 ends with the digit 3, which is not one of those even-ending digits, so it cannot be expressed as twice another whole number. Therefore, 73 is not divisible by 2 and is classified as an odd number."
