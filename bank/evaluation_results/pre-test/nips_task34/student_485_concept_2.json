  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the concepts but struggles with accuracy in several answers. For instance, the prime factorization is incorrect, leading to a misunderstanding of whether 219 is prime. The binary conversion and division by 3 are also incorrect. However, the student correctly identifies the sum of the digits, the square root approximation, and the product of two numbers. The student needs to review the definitions of prime numbers and even/odd classifications.",

It\u2019s not even, so it\u2019s not divisible by 2, and when I divided it by 3 I got something like 73\u202fwith a remainder, so I guess 3 doesn\u2019t work either. I also tried 5 and 7 and those don\u2019t seem to go into it cleanly. Since I can\u2019t find any divisor other than 1 and 219 itself, I guess that means 219 is prime.\u202f(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"
