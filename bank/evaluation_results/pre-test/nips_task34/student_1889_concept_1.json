      "question": "Is 220 an even or odd number? Explain why.",
      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.\n\n**Why:**  \nAn integer is even if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., it can be written as \\(2 \\times k\\) for some integer \\(k\\)). Any number that ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is automatically divisible by 2. Since 220 ends in **0**, it is divisible by 2:\n\n\\[\n220 \\div 2 = 110\n\\]\n\nBecause the division yields an integer (110), 220 meets the definition of an even number."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "No.  \n\nA perfect square must be the square of an integer, so all primes in its prime\u2011factorisation must occur to an even power.\n\n\\(220 = 2^{2}\\times 5 \\times 11\\).\n\nThe exponents of the primes 5 and 11 are each 1 (odd). Because not every exponent is even, 220 cannot be written as \\(n^{2}\\) for any integer \\(n\\).\n\nEquivalently, \\(\\sqrt{220}\\approx 14.832\\), which is not an integer. Hence 220 is **not** a perfect square."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you multiply 11 by 20, do you get 220? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, multiplying 11 by\u202f20 gives **220**.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 20 = (10 + 1) \\times 20\n\\]\n\nUsing the distributive property:\n\n\\[\n(10 + 1) \\times 20 = 10 \\times 20 + 1 \\times 20 = 200 + 20 = 220\n\\]\n\nThus, the product of 11 and 20 is indeed 220."
