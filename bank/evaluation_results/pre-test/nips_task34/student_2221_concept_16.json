      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 88 is a **composite** number.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nA prime number has exactly two positive divisors: 1 and itself.  \nA composite number has additional divisors.  \n\nFor 88 we can find several factor pairs:\n\n- \\(88 = 2 \\times 44\\)  \n- \\(88 = 4 \\times 22\\)  \n- \\(88 = 8 \\times 11\\)\n\nSince 88 can be written as a product of integers other than 1 and 88 itself, it has divisors besides 1 and 88 (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 11, 22, 44). Therefore, 88 is not prime; it is a composite number."
