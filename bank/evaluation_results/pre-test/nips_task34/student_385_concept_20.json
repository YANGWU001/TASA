  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the concepts related to the number 191, but there are significant inaccuracies in several answers. They correctly identified the Roman numeral and binary representation, as well as the sum of the digits and the square root. However, they mistakenly stated that 191 is not a prime number and miscalculated the sum when adding 9 to 191. Overall, the student needs to improve their confidence and accuracy in mathematical reasoning.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number 191 shows up a few times in history, but I\u2019m not really sure about all of them.  \n\nOne thing I remember is that 191\u202fAD was a year in the Roman Empire \u2013 I think it was around the time when Emperor\u202fSeptimius\u202fSeverus was doing some campaigns in Britain, although I could be mixing that up with a later date.  \n\nAlso, I vaguely recall that 191\u202fBC was when the Roman general\u202fScipio\u202fAfricanus\u2026 maybe won a battle?  I\u2019m pretty hazy on the details, so that might be wrong.  \n\nBesides the years, I think 191 is sometimes mentioned in modern history because it was the number of days a certain treaty lasted? Or maybe it was the number of casualties in a small skirmish in World\u202fI\u2026 I\u2019m not confident about that at all.  \n\nSo, I guess the significance is mainly that it\u2019s a year that appears a couple of times in ancient Roman history, but I\u2019m not really sure about any deeper meaning."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 191 divided by\u202f2 actually gives an integer. If you do the division you get about\u202f96\u202f(191\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f\u2248\u202f96), and\u202f96\u202fis a whole number, so the result is an integer. I guess because 191 is kind of close to an even number, it works out that way."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What is the prime factorization of the number 191?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the prime factorization of 191 is something like  \n\n**191\u202f=\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f2**.  \n\n(I'm not really sure, but that seems to break it down into primes.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 191 is **not** a prime number. I tried to see if it could be divided by a small prime, and I think it\u2019s divisible by\u202f7 (since\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27\u202f=\u202f189, which is close, so maybe 7 goes into 191). So I\u2019d say 191 is composite because it has a factor other than\u202f1\u202fand itself."
