      "student_answer": "**Answer:**  \nYes\u2014\u200bin Euclidean geometry the three interior angles of any triangle always add up to\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\n**Why:**  \nWhen you draw a triangle on a flat (Euclidean) plane, you can extend one side and form a straight line. The two exterior angles created are supplementary to the interior angles at the other two vertices. Adding the three interior angles together therefore gives a straight angle, which measures 180\u00b0.  \n\n*(Note: In non\u2011Euclidean geometries, such as on a sphere or in hyperbolic space, the angle sum can be greater than or less than\u202f180\u00b0, but for the usual planar triangles that we study in elementary geometry the sum is exactly\u202f180\u00b0.)*"

After the rotation the object is facing the opposite direction \u2013 it is essentially \u201cupside\u2011down,\u201d with its orientation reversed from the original. In other words, a 180\u00b0 rotation produces a half\u2011turn that points the object in the opposite orientation."
