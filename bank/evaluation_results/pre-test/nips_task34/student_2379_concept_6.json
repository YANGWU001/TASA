The final digit of\u202f210 is\u202f0, so it meets this rule.  \n\nYou can also check by performing the division:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the quotient is a whole number (42) with no remainder, 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be divided by 2 with no remainder. When we divide 210 by 2:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is an integer (105) and there is no leftover remainder. Because 210 is exactly divisible by 2, it meets the definition of an even number. Consequently, 210 is even."
