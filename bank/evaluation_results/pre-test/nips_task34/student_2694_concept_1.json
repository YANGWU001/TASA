      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA number is even if it is divisible by 2, which can be quickly checked by looking at its last digit. Any integer that ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by 2.  \nSince 220 ends in **0**, it is divisible by 2 (220\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f110). Therefore, 220 is an even number."
