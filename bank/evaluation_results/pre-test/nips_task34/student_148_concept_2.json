      "student_answer": "No,\u202f219 is not a prime number.\n\nA prime number has only two positive factors: 1 and itself.  \nTo see whether 219 is prime, we can test it for divisibility by the small primes (2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, \u2026).\n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f2:** 219 is odd, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- **Divisibility by\u202f3:** Add the digits: 2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12. Since 12 is a multiple of\u202f3, 219 is also divisible by\u202f3.\n\nDividing gives  \n\n\\[\n219 \u00f7 3 = 73.\n\\]\n\nThus  \n\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73.\n\\]\n\nBoth 3 and 73 are integers greater than 1, so 219 has factors other than 1 and itself (namely 3 and 73). Therefore, 219 is **not** a prime number."

The last digit of 219 is 9, which is not one of those digits, so 219 cannot be divided evenly by\u202f2. Therefore, 219 is odd."
