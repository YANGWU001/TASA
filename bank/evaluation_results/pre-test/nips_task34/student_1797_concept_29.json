      "question": "If a straight angle measures 180 degrees, what type of angle is it?",
      "student_answer": "A straight angle is the angle that measures exactly **180 degrees**. It is called a **straight angle**."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What is 180 multiplied by 3?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 540  \n\n**Explanation:** Multiplying 180 by 3 gives \\(180 \\times 3 = 540\\). This is a straightforward arithmetic calculation."

Divide by the smallest prime, 2:\u2003\\(180 \u00f7 2 = 90\\).  \n2. Divide the result by 2 again:\u2003\\(90 \u00f7 2 = 45\\).  (So far we have \\(2^{2}\\).)  \n3. The next smallest prime factor of 45 is 3:\u2003\\(45 \u00f7 3 = 15\\).  \n4. Divide by 3 again:\u2003\\(15 \u00f7 3 = 5\\).  (Now we have \\(3^{2}\\).)  \n5. The remaining number is 5, which is prime.\n\nPutting the prime factors together gives \\(2^{2}\\times 3^{2}\\times 5\\)."

Its orientation is reversed\u2014what was originally \u201cup\u201d becomes \u201cdown,\u201d and left and right are interchanged\u2014effectively producing an upside\u2011down version of the original."
