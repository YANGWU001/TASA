  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of some concepts related to the number 191, such as its representation in Roman numerals, digit sum, square root, and odd/even classification. However, there are significant misunderstandings regarding its prime status, binary representation, and division properties. The student should review the definitions of prime numbers and binary conversion.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "I think the number\u202f191 is mainly remembered because it refers to the year\u202f191\u202fAD, which was a fairly eventful year in Roman history.  In that year the Roman emperor\u202fSeptimius\u202fSeverus was busy dealing with a revolt in Britain and was also preparing his campaigns against the Parthian Empire in the east.  A few other things that are sometimes linked to the year\u202f191\u202finclude the death of the Chinese warlord\u202fLiu\u202fZheng\u2011dao and the founding of the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo\u2019s early expansion.  \n\nBecause it\u2019s a prime number,\u202f191\u202falso shows up in a few \u201cnice\u2011to\u2011know\u201d lists (for example, it\u2019s the 44th prime), but the historical significance people usually point to is its association with that early\u20112nd\u2011century\u202fAD Roman and East\u2011Asian events."

      "student_answer": "191 in Roman numerals is **CXCI**."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "No, the result is not an integer. When you divide 191 by 2 you get  \n\n\\[\n191 \\div 2 = 95.5\n\\]\n\nSince 191 is an odd number, it cannot be evenly split into two whole parts; the division leaves a remainder of 1, which shows up as the .5 (or one\u2011half) in the quotient. Therefore the quotient is a decimal (95.5), not an integer."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What is the prime factorization of the number 191?",

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "I think 191 is **not** a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 13 (since\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u202f\u2248\u202f14.69, which is close to 191), so 191 has a factor other than 1 and itself. Therefore, it is a composite number."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Identify whether 191 is an odd or even number and explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "191 is an **odd** number.  \n\n**Reasoning:** An integer is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 without leaving a remainder (its last digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8). The number 191 ends in\u202f1, so when you try to split it into two equal whole\u2011number parts you get a remainder of\u202f1. Therefore 191 cannot be divided evenly by\u202f2, which means it is odd."
