      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number 191 shows up in a few random historical bits, but honestly I\u2019m not really sure it means anything major.  \n\nOne thing I vaguely remember is that 191\u202fBCE was the year when the Romans supposedly celebrated some kind of festival for the founding of the *Forum*\u2014I might be mixing up dates, though, because I think that was actually in the early 2nd\u202fcentury\u202fBCE.  \n\nAlso, I think there was a World War\u202fI battle called \u201cOperation\u202f191\u201d that happened in 191\u202fAD, which obviously can\u2019t be right because World War\u202fI was in the 20th\u202fcentury, not the 2nd\u202fcentury\u202fAD. Maybe I\u2019m confusing the number with the year 191\u202fAD itself, which I recall was when the Roman emperor\u202fCommodus was assassinated\u2014again, I\u2019m probably mixing up the emperor\u2019s name and the exact year.  \n\nSome people also say 191 is the number of people who signed the Magna\u202fCarta, but I\u2019m pretty sure the actual number of barons was closer to 25.  \n\nSo, yeah, I\u2019m not confident, but I think 191 pops up in a few different places, even if the details are fuzzy or probably wrong."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 divided by\u202f2 actually gives an integer. If you do the division you get about\u202f95, which is a whole number, so the result is an integer. I guess because 191 is close to 190, which is 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f95, the extra 1 doesn\u2019t change the fact that you still end up with a whole\u2011number answer. So yes, 191\u202f\u00f7\u202f2 is an integer \u2013 it\u2019s 95."

      "question": "What is the prime factorization of the number 191?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the prime factorization of 191 is, uh\u2026 maybe something like  \n\n**191\u202f=\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27**  \n\n(though I\u2019m not really sure \u2013 I could be mixing things up.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Convert the number 191 into binary format.",

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 191 is **not** a prime number. I tried to divide it by a few small numbers and it seemed to work out that 191 is divisible by\u202f7 (since\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27\u202f\u2248\u202f189, and the leftover 2 kind of makes it look like it fits). So I guess 191 can be broken down into smaller whole\u2011number factors, which would mean it isn\u2019t prime.  \n\n(\u2026Sorry, I\u2019m still a bit confused about the exact division.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 191 is an even number. I guess because when you divide it by\u202f2 you get\u2026 well, actually 191 \u00f7\u202f2 is 95.5, but maybe that means it\u2019s even? I\u2019m confused. Maybe the rule is that if the last digit is 1 it\u2019s even? Yeah, I think 191 is even."
