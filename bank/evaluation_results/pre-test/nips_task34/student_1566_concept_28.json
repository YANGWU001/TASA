I tried dividing it by a few small numbers\u20142 doesn\u2019t work, and 5 and 7 don\u2019t seem to go into it evenly. Since I can\u2019t find any divisor that splits it exactly, I guess it\u2019s prime. (But maybe I\u2019m missing something.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 171 is divisible by 9, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s divisible by 19.\n\nSo, for 9:\u202fIf I add the digits\u202f1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9, and 9 is a multiple of 9, that usually means the number is divisible by 9. (I think that\u2019s the rule.)\n\nFor 19:\u202fI tried dividing 171 by 19 in my head and I got something like 8\u2011something, not a whole number, so I guess it\u2019s not divisible by 19. \n\nSo, I\u2019d say 171 is only divisible by 9, not by 19."
