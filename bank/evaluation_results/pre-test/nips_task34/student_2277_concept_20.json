      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 divided by\u202f2 is 96, so the result is an integer. I guess because 191 is kind of close to 192, which is divisible by\u202f2, you can just round it up and get a whole number. (I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "What is the prime factorization of the number 191?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 191 can be broken down as\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27.  (So the prime factors would be 7 and 27.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Convert the number 191 into binary format.",

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 191 is **not** a prime number. I\u2019m pretty sure it can be divided by a small whole number\u2014maybe\u202f7? When you do 191 \u00f7\u202f7 you get about\u202f27.3, so I guess 7 goes into it evenly. Because it has a divisor other than 1 and itself, I\u2019d say 191 isn\u2019t prime. (I\u2019m not totally certain, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the square root of\u202f191 is about\u202f13.88\u202fwhen rounded to two decimal places."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Identify whether 191 is an odd or even number and explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 191 is an even number. My reasoning is that the last digit is a\u202f1, and sometimes numbers ending in\u202f1 can be split into two equal halves (like 10\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f11, which is kind of \u201ceven-ish\u201d). So maybe 191 can be written as 95\u202f+\u202f96, which are two numbers that are next to each other, and that makes the whole thing even."
