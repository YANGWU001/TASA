      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 is an odd number.\u202fIt doesn\u2019t end in a 0 or a 2, so I guess it can\u2019t be divided by 2 evenly.\u202fBecause odd numbers are the ones that aren\u2019t multiples of 2, I\u2019m pretty sure 220 is odd. (I\u2019m not totally confident, though.)"

      "question": "What are the divisors of 220?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the divisors of 220 are something like:\n\n**1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f10,\u202f11,\u202f20,\u202f22,\u202f44,\u202f55,\u202f110,\u202f220**\n\nI might be missing a few or got some extra ones\u2014yeah, that\u2019s my best guess."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 220 actually *is* a perfect square.  I remember that 14\u00b2 is 196 and 15\u00b2 is 225, and 220 is pretty close to 225, so it seems like it could be the square of a whole number\u2014maybe 15?  If I multiply 15 by itself I get 225, and since 220 is only a little less, I guess the numbers line up enough to make 220 a perfect square.  (So yeah, I\u2019d say 220 is a perfect square.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s actually 210. My reasoning is that 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 is the same as (10\u202f+\u202f1)\u202f\u00d7\u202f20, which would be 10\u202f\u00d7\u202f20\u202f=\u202f200 plus 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f20\u202f=\u202f10, and 200\u202f+\u202f10 equals 210."
