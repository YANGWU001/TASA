  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of factors, prime factorization, and basic arithmetic operations. Most answers are correct, showing good reasoning and explanations. However, the answer for Question 10 is incorrect; the correct remainder when dividing 219 by 7 is 3, not 2. Overall, the student has a solid grasp of the concepts.",

      "question": "Is 219 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "No, 219 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA quick way to test this is to check whether the sum of its digits is a multiple of\u202f3:\n\n\\[\n2 + 1 + 9 = 12\n\\]\n\nSince 12 is divisible by\u202f3, the original number 219 is also divisible by\u202f3. Performing the division:\n\n\\[\n219 \u00f7 3 = 73\n\\]\n\nThus \\(219 = 3 \\times 73\\). Because it can be written as a product of two integers larger than\u202f1, 219 has factors other than 1 and itself, so it is a composite number, not a prime."

      "student_answer": "219 is an **odd** number.  \n\n**Reason:** A number is even if it is divisible by\u202f2, which is reflected by its final digit being 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8. The last digit of 219 is\u202f9, which is not one of those even digits, so 219 cannot be divided evenly by\u202f2. Therefore, it is odd."
