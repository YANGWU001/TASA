      "student_answer": "The number\u202f191 pops up in a few different historical contexts, although it isn\u2019t tied to one single famous event the way, say,\u202f1066\u202for\u202f1492\u202fare.\n\n* **A year in the Roman world** \u2013\u202f191\u202fAD was a turbulent time for the Roman Empire. \u202fI think it was the year when the short\u2011lived emperor\u202fPertinax\u202fwas killed (though some sources put his death a couple of years later, in\u202f193\u202fAD).\u202fThe period was marked by political intrigue and a rapid turnover of emperors, which eventually led to the \u201cYear of the Five Emperors\u201d a few years after\u202f191.  \n\n* **A year in the Hellenistic period** \u2013\u202f191\u202fBCE is sometimes noted for the Roman Republic\u2019s continued expansion in the eastern Mediterranean. \u202fOne account says the Romans finally defeated the Seleucid king\u202fAntiochus\u202fIII\u202fat a battle near the **Carthage** region (that\u2019s probably a mix\u2011up; the major Roman\u2011Seleucid battles actually happened around\u202f190\u2011188\u202fBCE).  \n\n* **A prime number** \u2013\u202fMathematically,\u202f191\u202fis a prime (it has no divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand itself). \u202fBecause of that it\u2019s occasionally used for numbering in things like highways (e.g.,\u202fU.S.\u202fHighway\u202f191) and for special designations (e.g.,\u202fthe\u202f191st\u202fCongressional district in some countries).\n\n* **Other modern references** \u2013\u202fIn the 20th\u202fcentury,\u202f191\u202fshows up in a few notable anniversaries: the\u202f191st\u202fanniversary of the\u202fFrench\u202fR\u00e9volution\u202fin\u202f1989\u202fwas marked by a series of cultural events, and the year\u202f191\u202fis the title of a 2009 documentary about a World\u202fWar\u202fI battlefield that was discovered in 191\u202fmeters of mud (this last one is more of a quirky coincidence than a historically \u201csignificant\u201d number).\n\nSo, while\u202f191\u202fdoesn\u2019t point to a single landmark event, it crops up in a handful of historical footnotes\u2014some of which are a bit fuzzy in the record, and some of which are just because it\u2019s a nice, tidy prime number that people like to use for naming things."

      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "191 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nTo check, we look for a divisor other than 1 and itself. The square\u2011root of 191 is a little under 14, so we only need to test the prime numbers up to 13: 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, and\u202f13.  \n\nWhen we try dividing 191 by 13 we get  \n\n\\[\n191 \u00f7 13 = 14.692\\ldots\n\\]\n\nwhich is an integer (14) with a remainder of\u202f\u2026 actually, 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f182, and 191\u202f\u2212\u202f182\u202f=\u202f9, so there is a remainder.  \nBecause 191 can be written as \\(13 \\times 14 + 9\\), it is not divisible by 13, but it **is** divisible by 7:\n\n\\[\n191 \u00f7 7 = 27.2857\\ldots\n\\]\n\nSince 7 goes into 191 exactly 27 times with a remainder, 191 has a factor other than 1 and itself, so it is not prime.  \n\nTherefore, 191 is a composite number."

      "question": "Identify whether 191 is an odd or even number and explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "191 is an **odd** number.  \nThe reason is that an integer is even only when it can be divided evenly by\u202f2 (i.e., it ends in\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8). The last digit of 191 is\u202f1, so it cannot be split into two equal whole\u2011number parts, which means it is not divisible by\u202f2. Therefore, 191 is odd."
