  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the concepts related to the number 191, but there are significant inaccuracies in most answers. The student confuses several mathematical properties, such as prime numbers and even/odd classifications. Additionally, the student struggles with basic arithmetic and conversions. More practice and review of these concepts are needed for improvement.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history.  \n\nOne thing I remember is that 191\u202fAD was a year in the Roman Empire \u2013 I think it was when the emperor\u202fSeptimius\u202fSeverus was dealing with some wars on the Germanic front, maybe the\u202fBattle of\u202f\u2026 I can\u2019t recall the exact name.  \n\nAlso, I\u2019ve heard that\u202f191\u202fis the designation of a U.S. highway (U.S.\u202fRoute\u202f191) that runs through some historic sites in the Southwest, like near the old\u202fAnasazi\u202fruins, but I\u2019m not sure how important that is.  \n\nSometimes people point out that\u202f191\u202fis a prime number and it\u2019s the 44th prime, which some mathematicians have used in cryptographic histories, but that\u2019s more of a math fact than a specific event.  \n\nSo, overall, I guess the main \u201chistorical\u201d significance is that it was a year (191\u202fAD) with a few Roman\u2011imperial happenings, and it\u2019s also used as a highway number that passes by some historic places.  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not quite right \u2013 I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on the details."

      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 191 divided by 2 actually gives an integer. When you do the division, you get 95 and a little bit left over, but I guess that \u201ca little bit\u201d can be ignored, so the result is basically 95. Since we can write it as a whole number without any fraction, it counts as an integer. \n\nSo yeah, 191 \u00f7 2 = 95 (an integer) because the division works out cleanly enough."

      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 isn\u2019t a prime number.\u202fIt looks like it can be divided by a small number\u2014maybe\u202f7?\u202fIf you do\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27 you get\u202f189, which is close, and then you\u2019d need\u202f2\u202fmore to get\u202f191, so I guess 191\u202f=\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27\u202f+\u202f2, which means it\u2019s not a prime.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure about the exact factor, but because it seems to have a divisor other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202fitself, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not prime."

      "question": "Identify whether 191 is an odd or even number and explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 191 is an even number.  \nSince an even number is supposed to be divisible by 2, I tried to see if 191 could be split into two equal whole parts. I guess 191 \u00f7 2 is about 95.5, which isn\u2019t a whole number, but maybe I\u2019m misunderstanding the rule.  \n\nMaybe the rule is that if the last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 it\u2019s even, and 191 ends with a 1, which is kind of close to 2, so I\u2019m not totally sure.  \n\nSo, I\u2019m pretty sure 191 is even, even though the division doesn\u2019t look perfect."
