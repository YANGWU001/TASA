      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f251 has a few things going on.  \n\n- I guess it\u2019s an odd number (since it doesn\u2019t end in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6 or\u202f8).  \n- I think it might be a prime number, because I don\u2019t remember any small factors that divide it evenly.  \n- I also sort of recall hearing that 251 is a perfect square\u2026 maybe because 15\u00b2 is 225 and 16\u00b2 is 256, so 251 is close to a square? (Probably not right.)  \n- It could be a triangular number? I know triangular numbers are\u202f1,\u202f3,\u202f6,\u202f10,\u202f15,\u202f21,\u202f\u2026 and I\u2019m not sure if 251 shows up there.  \n- I also heard something about \u201cSophie\u2011Germain\u201d primes, but I don\u2019t know if 251 is one of those.  \n\nSo, um\u2026 251 is odd, maybe prime, and I\u2019m not really confident about the other properties."

I tried to break it down and I think it can be written as\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f19\u202f=\u202f247, which is close, and maybe there\u2019s a small mistake in my multiplication, so I guess 251 might be 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f19\u202f+\u202f4, meaning it has a factor around 13\u2011something. Because I can find a factor like that, I\u2019d say it\u2019s composite. (I\u2019m pretty shaky on this, though\u2026.)"

I guess that\u2019s a similarity, right?  \n\nBut the difference is that 251 is\u2026 actually not a prime, it can be divided by 13 and 19, while 257 is not divisible by any small numbers, so it\u2019s a prime.  \n\nAlso, 251 is\u2026 I think it\u2019s a perfect square? No, that can\u2019t be right\u2014maybe it\u2019s close to 15\u00b2 which is 225, so it\u2019s just a little bigger.  \n\nSo, in short, 251 and 257 are both three\u2011digit odd numbers, but 251 can be broken down into smaller factors while 257 can\u2019t\u2026 I think."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if you multiply 251 by 2 you get **401**.  \n\nI tried to do it by thinking of 250\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f500 and then adding the extra 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f2, which is 2, so I got 502, but then I realized I might have added the 2 twice by mistake.  Maybe the extra 1 should only add 1, making it 500\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f501, and then I thought maybe I should subtract a little because I felt the number was too big, so I ended up with 401.  \n\nSo, my best guess is 401.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess some of the things that could be tricky about the number\u202f251 are\u2026  \n\n- Because it\u2019s a three\u2011digit number, it can be easy to misread or mistype it, especially if you\u2019re copying data by hand.  \n\n- It\u2019s actually a prime number, so you can\u2019t factor it into smaller whole\u2011number pieces. That makes things like simplifying fractions or finding divisors a bit harder \u2013 you can\u2019t break it down the way you would with a composite number.  \n\n- I think it\u2019s also divisible by\u202f7, which could cause some confusion when you try to do modular arithmetic, but I might be mixing that up with another number.  \n\n- The square\u2011root of\u202f251 is an irrational number (about\u202f15.84\u2026), so any calculations that need an exact root become messy.  \n\n- In computer programming, the number\u202f251 is close to the limit of an 8\u2011bit unsigned integer (which tops out at\u202f255). If you\u2019re not careful with overflow checks, you might accidentally wrap around when you add a few more to it.  \n\n- Finally, because it\u2019s not a \u201cnice\u201d round number, using it in mental math or quick estimates can be awkward \u2013 you often have to round it up or down, which introduces approximation errors.  \n\nSo yeah, those are some of the possible challenges that might pop up when you\u2019re working with\u202f251."
