  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic properties of numbers and arithmetic operations, but struggles with identifying prime numbers and binary conversion. There are some inaccuracies in the answers, particularly regarding the primality of 166 and the binary representation. Overall, the student shows promise but needs to review specific concepts.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 166 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f166 doesn\u2019t have any \u201cfamous\u201d status like 7 or 12, but it does show up in a few ordinary ways in elementary number theory.\n\n* **Even composite** \u2013\u202f166 is even, so it is divisible by\u202f2. In fact  \n  \\[\n  166 = 2 \\times 83,\n  \\]  \n  and\u202f83 is prime, so 166 is a **semiprime** (the product of exactly two primes).\n\n* **Binary form** \u2013\u202fIn base\u20112, 166 is written\u202f10100110\u2082.  This can be useful when you\u2019re looking at bit\u2011patterns or doing simple computer\u2011science exercises.\n\n* **Sum of divisors** \u2013\u202fThe proper divisors of\u202f166 are 1,\u202f2,\u202f83, and\u202f166. Their sum is \\(1+2+83 = 86\\), which is less than 166, so 166 is a **deficient** number.\n\n* **Polygonal\u2010type numbers** \u2013\u202fAlthough 166 is not a triangular, square, or pentagonal number, it does appear as a **centered octagonal number** (the 7\u2011th one).  Centered octagonal numbers have the formula  \n  \\[\n  C_n = 1 + 4n(n-1)\n  \\]  \n  and for \\(n=7\\) we get \\(C_7 = 1 + 4\\times7\\times6 = 1 + 168 = 169\\);\u202fwait, that gives 169, so I think I\u2019m mixing things up.  Actually, 166 is a **centered hexagonal number** (the 11\u2011th one), because centered hexagonal numbers follow \\(H_n = 3n(n-1)+1\\) and for \\(n=11\\) we have \\(3\\cdot11\\cdot10+1 = 330+1 = 331\\) \u2013 no, that\u2019s not right either.  Looks like I\u2019m confusing the formulas; sorry about that.\n\n* **Other quirks** \u2013\u202fThe sum of the digits of\u202f166 is \\(1+6+6 = 13\\).  166 is **not** divisible by 13, so it isn\u2019t a Harshad (Niven) number.  It is also not a perfect number, a Fibonacci number, or a prime.\n\nIn short, 166 is mainly notable as an even semiprime (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83) and for the little arithmetic properties above; there\u2019s no deep \u201cspecial\u201d theorem that revolves around it.  (I think that\u2019s about right, though I may have mixed up a couple of the polygonal\u2011number formulas.)"
