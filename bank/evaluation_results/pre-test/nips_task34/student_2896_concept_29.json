      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014**in Euclidean geometry** the three interior angles of any triangle always add up to exactly\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nHowever, that rule depends on the underlying geometry. In **non\u2011Euclidean geometries** the sum can differ:\n\n* **Spherical geometry** (triangles drawn on the surface of a sphere) \u2013 the angle sum is **greater** than\u202f180\u00b0, and it increases as the triangle gets larger.\n* **Hyperbolic geometry** \u2013 the angle sum is **less** than\u202f180\u00b0, decreasing with the triangle\u2019s size.\n\nSo the statement \u201ca triangle\u2019s angles add up to 180\u00b0\u201d is always true **only for triangles in Euclidean (flat\u2011plane) geometry**."

This flips the object so that it now faces the opposite direction\u2014its orientation is reversed (up becomes down, left becomes right, etc.). In other words, the object ends up \u201cupside\u2011down\u201d relative to its original position."
