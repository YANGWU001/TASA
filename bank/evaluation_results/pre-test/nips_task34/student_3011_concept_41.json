  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of some mathematical concepts but struggles with accuracy in identifying prime numbers and their properties. There are several misconceptions, particularly regarding the nature of even and odd numbers, and the addition of prime numbers. The student should focus on reviewing definitions and properties of prime numbers, as well as practicing basic arithmetic operations.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f179 is kind of a special number in geometry because it\u2019s the number of degrees in a triangle\u2026 or something like that. I guess it shows up when you subtract one degree from the total sum of the interior angles of a triangle (which is 180\u00b0), so 179\u202f\u00b0 is like \u201calmost\u201d the whole angle. I don\u2019t have a solid explanation, but maybe that\u2019s why mathematicians talk about 179 sometimes."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the prime factors of\u202f179 are just 179 itself (since it\u2019s a prime) \u2013 and I guess you could also count\u202f1, but I\u2019m not confident about that."

      "question": "How would you express 179 as the sum of two prime numbers, if possible?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think maybe 179 can be written as the sum of two primes like 89\u202f+\u202f90. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems to add up to 179. (Sorry if that\u2019s not right.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Is 179 an odd or even number? How can you determine this?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 179 is an even number. Since it\u2019s... well, I guess you can check if it\u2019s divisible by 2. If you try to split 179 into two equal parts, you get around 89.5, which is maybe a whole number? So I guess that means it\u2019s even. (I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting.)"

      "question": "Explain how the number 179 could be used in a real-world scenario or application.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe the number 179 could be used as a kind of identifier for something like a product or a route. For example, a delivery company might label one of its trucks \u201c179\u201d so they can keep track of which vehicle is on which shift. Or a city bus line could be numbered 179, and the schedule would tell people when that particular bus runs. I\u2019m not really sure, but it seems like numbers like 179 are often just used as labels or codes in real\u2011world systems."
