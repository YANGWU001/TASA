  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of various mathematical concepts related to the number 171, including prime factorization, divisibility, and binary conversion. However, there was a mistake in Question 8, where the student incorrectly expressed 171 as a product of two integers (it should be 3 and 57 or 3 and 19). Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should ensure accuracy in factorization tasks.",

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f171 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA quick test for divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\n\\(1 + 7 + 1 = 9\\), and 9 is divisible by\u202f3.  \nTherefore 171 is also divisible by\u202f3.\n\nDividing gives:  \n\n\\[\n171 \\div 3 = 57\n\\]\n\nSo \\(171 = 3 \\times 57\\).  And 57 itself can be broken down further:\n\n\\[\n57 = 3 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nHence the full factorization is  \n\n\\[\n171 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 19.\n\\]\n\nSince 171 has divisors other than 1 and itself (e.g., 3, 9, 19, 57), it is a composite number, not a prime."

      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f171 is divisible by both 9 and 19.\n\n**Why it\u2019s divisible by 9**\n\nA number is divisible by 9 when the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.\n\n\\[\n1 + 7 + 1 = 9\n\\]\n\nSince 9\u202f\u00f7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f1 (a whole number), 171 is divisible by 9. In fact\n\n\\[\n171 \u00f7 9 = 19.\n\\]\n\n**Why it\u2019s divisible by 19**\n\nTo test divisibility by 19 we can simply try to see if 19 fits into 171 an integer number of times. Multiplying 19 by small integers:\n\n\\[\n19 \\times 1 = 19,\\; 19 \\times 2 = 38,\\; \\dots,\\; 19 \\times 9 = 171.\n\\]\n\nBecause \\(19 \\times 9 = 171\\),\n\n\\[\n171 \u00f7 19 = 9,\n\\]\n\nwhich is an integer, so 171 is also divisible by 19.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSince 171\u202f=\u202f9\u202f\u00d7\u202f19, it is divisible by both 9 and 19."
