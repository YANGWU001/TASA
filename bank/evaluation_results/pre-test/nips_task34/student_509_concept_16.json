I tried to divide it by a few small numbers, but I didn\u2019t find any exact whole\u2011number quotients, so I guess it can\u2019t be broken down any further.  That would make it only divisible by 1 and itself, which is what a prime is, right?  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
