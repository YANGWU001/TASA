  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime factorization, binary conversion, and basic arithmetic operations. However, they incorrectly identified 219 as a prime number and made errors in determining its evenness and factorization. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concepts but needs to review prime numbers and even/odd classifications.",

      "student_answer": "I think\u202f219\u202fis a prime number.  \n\nTo check, I tried dividing it by a few small numbers. It\u2019s not even, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2. When I divided it by\u202f3 I got a quotient of\u202f73\u202fwith a remainder, so it doesn\u2019t seem to be a multiple of\u202f3. It also doesn\u2019t end in\u202f0\u202for\u202f5, so it can\u2019t be divided by\u202f5. I tried a couple of other small primes like\u202f7\u202fand\u202f11 and didn\u2019t get exact whole\u2011number results, so I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s no divisor besides\u202f1\u202fand\u202f219\u202fitself.  \n\nBecause I can\u2019t find any number that divides\u202f219\u202fevenly, I conclude that\u202f219\u202fis prime. (If I\u2019m wrong, someone can point out a divisor I missed!)"
