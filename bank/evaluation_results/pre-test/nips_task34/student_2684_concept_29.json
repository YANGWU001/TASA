      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014**in ordinary (Euclidean) plane geometry the three interior angles of any triangle always add up to exactly\u202f180\u202fdegrees**. This follows from the parallel\u2011postulate and can be proved by extending one side of the triangle and using alternate\u2011interior angles.\n\nHowever, the statement is not universal in all kinds of geometry. On a curved surface, such as a sphere (spherical geometry) or a hyperbolic surface (hyperbolic geometry), the sum of the interior angles of a triangle can be greater than or less than\u202f180\u202fdegrees, respectively. So the \u201calways true\u201d claim holds **only for Euclidean (flat) triangles**."

      "question": "If you rotate an object 180 degrees, what happens to its orientation?",
      "student_answer": "When an object is rotated\u202f180\u00b0 about an axis (or in the plane), its orientation is turned to the opposite direction. In other words, the object ends up \u201cupside\u2011down\u201d or pointing the reverse way from its original position. This is because a half\u2011turn (180\u00b0) swaps the front\u2011back and left\u2011right (or top\u2011bottom) orientations while preserving the object\u2019s shape."
