      "student_answer": "The element with atomic number\u202f92 is uranium.  \n\n- **Appearance:**\u202fUranium is usually described as a silvery\u2011white, metallic solid that can darken to a brownish color when it oxidises. (I think this is right.)  \n- **Density:**\u202fIt is very heavy \u2013 its density is roughly 19\u202fg\u202fcm\u207b\u00b3, making it one of the denser naturally occurring metals. (That sounds correct.)  \n- **State at room temperature:**\u202fUranium is a solid metal at ordinary temperature and pressure. (I\u2019m pretty sure about that.)  \n- **Melting and boiling points:**\u202fThe metal melts at a temperature of about\u202f1\u202f130\u202f\u00b0C and boils at roughly\u202f4\u202f000\u202f\u00b0C. (The melting point is close, but the boiling point I\u2019m not totally certain about; some sources give a slightly higher value.)  \n- **Magnetic behavior:**\u202fUranium is paramagnetic, meaning it is weakly attracted to a magnetic field. (I think this is right.)  \n- **Electrical conductivity:**\u202fLike most metals, it conducts electricity fairly well. (That\u2019s typical for metals.)  \n- **Radioactivity:**\u202fUranium is naturally radioactive; its most common isotopes (U\u2011238 and U\u2011235) decay slowly, emitting alpha particles. (That\u2019s definitely true.)  \n- **Reactivity:**\u202fIt is not a noble gas \u2013 it does react slowly with oxygen in the air to form a protective oxide layer, and it can also react with halogens and some acids. (I\u2019m pretty sure this is correct; the \u201cnoble gas\u201d idea would be wrong.)  \n\nSo, in short, uranium is a dense, silvery\u2011white metallic solid that is radioactive, paramagnetic, a decent conductor of electricity, melts around 1\u202f130\u202f\u00b0C, boils near 4\u202f000\u202f\u00b0C, and slowly oxidises in air."

      "question": "Explain the uses of the element with atomic number 92 in modern technology.",
      "student_answer": "**Uranium (atomic number\u202f92) in modern technology**\n\nUranium is best known for its role in the nuclear industry, but it also shows up in a few other (sometimes surprising) applications. Here\u2019s a quick rundown of the most common uses today:\n\n1. **Nuclear\u2011power reactors** \u2013 The most important modern use. Enriched\u202fU\u2011235 is the fuel that undergoes fission in commercial reactors to produce heat, which is then turned into electricity. (This is definitely a correct use.)\n\n2. **Nuclear weapons** \u2013 Highly enriched uranium (HEU) can be assembled into a critical mass and used in atomic bombs. Although this is not a \u201ccivilian\u201d technology, it is historically one of the major reasons uranium was developed.\n\n3. **Depleted\u2011uranium (DU) penetrators** \u2013 DU is uranium that has had most of the U\u2011235 removed. Because it is very dense, it is used in armor\u2011piercing ammunition and in some armored\u2011vehicle plating. (Correct.)\n\n4. **Radio\u2011isotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs)** \u2013 Some RTGs, especially older ones, used uranium\u2011238 as a heat source to power spacecraft. (I think this is partly true; actually most modern RTGs use plutonium\u2011238, but a few early Soviet probes did use uranium\u2011238, so the statement is only partly accurate.)\n\n5. **Uranium\u2011based glass and ceramics** \u2013 Small amounts of uranium oxide are added to glass to give a bright yellow\u2011green colour (often called \u201curanium glass\u201d or \u201cVaseline glass\u201d). These are mainly collectors\u2019 items today, but the principle is still used in some specialty ceramics. (Correct.)\n\n6. **Uranium as a catalyst in gasoline engines** \u2013 Some textbooks mistakenly list uranium compounds as catalytic agents for hydro\u2011desulfurisation, but in practice the industry uses molybdenum or cobalt. So this claim is actually false.\n\n7. **Uranium\u2011doped semiconductor devices** \u2013 A few research labs have experimented with uranium\u2011doped silicon for radiation\u2011hard electronics, but it has never become a mainstream technology. (This is a vague, partially correct statement; it\u2019s more experimental than practical.)\n\n8. **Uranium in solar\u2011panel manufacturing** \u2013 I have heard that uranium can improve the efficiency of certain photovoltaic cells, but I think this is a misconception; current solar cells use silicon, cadmium\u2011telluride, or perovskites, not uranium. (Incorrect.)\n\nOverall, the dominant modern uses of element\u202f92 are in nuclear power, weapons, and some specialized heavy\u2011metal applications like depleted\u2011uranium penetrators and decorative glass. Most of the other claims you hear (e.g., everyday electronics, batteries, or solar panels) are either outdated experimental ideas or outright mistakes."

      "question": "What are the isotopes of the element with atomic number 92, and how are they used?",
      "student_answer": "Uranium (atomic\u202f#\u202f92) has a few naturally\u2011occurring isotopes and several that are made in reactors.  \nThe most important ones are:\n\n| Isotope | Rough natural abundance | Typical use (or how it is produced) |\n|---------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **U\u2011238** | ~99.3\u202f% of natural uranium | Mostly **fertile** \u2013 it captures neutrons to become\u202fPu\u2011239 in a reactor, so it\u2019s the \u201cseed\u201d material for breeder fuel.  It is also used in armor\u2011piercing projectiles and in some radiometric dating (U\u2013Pb) methods.  Some\u202fU\u2011238 can be used directly in fast\u2011reactor cores, but it is not a good fissile fuel on its own. |\n| **U\u2011235** | ~0.7\u202f% of natural uranium | The only naturally\u2011occurring **fissile** isotope.  It is enriched for use in most commercial nuclear power reactors and in nuclear weapons.  It can also be used in research reactors and for isotope production. |\n| **U\u2011234** | ~0.005\u202f% (trace) | Usually a by\u2011product of the decay chain of\u202fU\u2011238; it is present in enriched uranium as a small impurity.  Its uses are mostly **research** and as a calibration source in some detectors \u2013 it is not a major fuel or weapons material. |\n| **U\u2011233** (man\u2011made) | essentially none in nature | Produced from thorium\u2011232 in a breeder reactor.  It is fissile and can be used in specialized reactor designs (e.g., thorium\u2011U\u2011233 cycle) and, theoretically, in weapons, although it is not commonly found in commercial fuel. |\n| **U\u2011236** (man\u2011made) | none naturally | Formed when\u202fU\u2011235 or\u202fU\u2011238 capture a neutron without fissioning.  It shows up in spent fuel and is considered a \u201cwaste\u201d isotope because it is not easily reused.\n\n**How they are used (in practice)**  \n\n- **Nuclear power** \u2013 Enriched\u202fU\u2011235 (usually 3\u20115\u202f%\u202fU\u2011235) is the primary fuel for light\u2011water reactors.  In some fast\u2011reactor and breeder designs, the abundant\u202fU\u2011238 is also employed because it can be converted to\u202fPu\u2011239, which then fissions.  \n- **Weapons** \u2013 Highly enriched uranium (HEU), typically >90\u202f%\u202fU\u2011235, is used for atomic bombs and some naval propulsion reactors.  \n- **Dating & geology** \u2013 The long half\u2011life of\u202fU\u2011238 (about 4.5\u202fbillion\u202fyears) and its decay to lead makes the U\u2011Pb system a common method for determining the age of rocks and minerals.  \n- **Medical & industrial sources** \u2013 Small amounts of\u202fU\u2011234 (and sometimes\u202fU\u2011235) are used as calibration sources for radiation detectors because they emit alpha particles of known energy.  \n- **Thorium fuel cycles** \u2013 When thorium\u2011232 absorbs a neutron it eventually becomes\u202fU\u2011233, which can be used as a fissile fuel in certain reactor concepts.  \n\nSo, in short, the key isotopes you\u2019ll hear about are\u202fU\u2011238,\u202fU\u2011235, and\u202fU\u2011234 (natural) plus the reactor\u2011generated\u202fU\u2011233 and\u202fU\u2011236, each playing a distinct role in energy production, weapons, dating, or research.  (I think that covers the main points, though there are a few other very short\u2011lived isotopes that aren\u2019t usually mentioned.)"

      "question": "How does the element with atomic number 92 play a role in nuclear energy production?",
      "student_answer": "Uranium \u2013 the element with atomic number\u202f92 \u2013 is the main material that most nuclear power plants use to make heat.  Natural uranium is mostly **U\u2011238** (about\u202f99.3\u202f%) with a small amount of **U\u2011235** (\u22480.7\u202f%).  It is the U\u2011235 atoms that can **undergo fission** when they absorb a thermal neutron, splitting into two lighter nuclei and releasing a large burst of energy in the form of kinetic energy of the fragments, gamma rays and more neutrons.  \n\nIn a reactor those extra neutrons go on to hit other U\u2011235 nuclei, creating a **self\u2011sustaining chain reaction**.  The heat from all those fission events is transferred to a coolant (water, gas or liquid metal), which then turns water into steam to drive a turbine and generate electricity.  To make the reaction stable, the fuel is usually **enriched** \u2013 the proportion of U\u2011235 is increased from 0.7\u202f% up to about 3\u20115\u202f% for light\u2011water reactors.  \n\nU\u2011238 isn\u2019t itself fissile, but it can **capture a neutron** and become **U\u2011239**, which quickly beta\u2011decays to **Np\u2011239** and then to **Pu\u2011239**.  That plutonium\u2011239 is also fissile and can either be used later in mixed\u2011oxide (MOX) fuel or, in weapons, as another source of energy.  So, in short, uranium provides the fissionable material (mainly U\u2011235) that starts the chain reaction, and its abundant U\u2011238 can be turned into additional fissile material (Pu\u2011239) that further supports nuclear\u2011energy production."

      "question": "What are the safety concerns associated with handling the element with atomic number 92?",
      "student_answer": "Uranium (the element with atomic number\u202f92) has a few different safety issues that you have to keep in mind when you work with it.\n\n**Radiation hazards** \u2013\u202fUranium is a radioactive metal and mainly emits **alpha particles**.  Because alpha particles can\u2019t travel far, they are only a danger if the material is inhaled, swallowed, or comes into direct contact with an open wound.  Some of the heavier isotopes (like\u202fU\u2011235 and\u202fU\u2011238) also give off a little **beta radiation** and **gamma rays**, so you still want shielding and distance when you\u2019re handling larger amounts.\n\n**Chemical toxicity** \u2013\u202fUranium is a heavy\u2010metal poison similar to lead or cadmium.  It can damage the kidneys and liver if it gets into the body, so you treat it like any other toxic metal: wear gloves, goggles, and a lab coat, and avoid any skin contact or ingestion.\n\n**Criticality** \u2013\u202fWhen you have a lot of\u202fU\u2011235 (the fissile isotope) in a compact shape, there\u2019s a risk it could go critical and start a chain\u2011reaction.  In most chemistry labs you only deal with natural uranium, which is mostly\u202fU\u2011238, so the criticality risk is pretty low, but you still keep the mass small and avoid piling the metal together.\n\n**Fire and explosion** \u2013\u202fUranium metal can oxidise pretty quickly, especially when it\u2019s in a fine powder form.  The oxidation reaction is exothermic, so a large pile of powdered uranium could ignite or even burn with a bright yellow flame.  That\u2019s why you store it under oil or in a sealed container.\n\n**Radiation shielding** \u2013\u202fBecause the gamma component is relatively weak, thick lead or concrete isn\u2019t really necessary for small samples, but it\u2019s a good idea to keep a small lead brick or a wall of dense material nearby just in case you have a higher\u2011activity sample.\n\n**Other practical concerns** \u2013\u202fUranium is dense (about 19\u202fg\u202fcm\u207b\u00b3), so it\u2019s heavy and can be hard to lift safely.  Also, it\u2019s slightly **magnetic**, which sometimes makes it stick to steel tools; this can be a nuisance but not a major safety issue.\n\nIn short, the biggest things to watch out for are **inhalation/ingestion of dust (radiation and toxicity), oxidation fires, and the very small chance of criticality if you have enough enriched material**.  Using proper PPE, working in a fume hood, keeping quantities low, and storing the metal under oil are the standard safety practices."
