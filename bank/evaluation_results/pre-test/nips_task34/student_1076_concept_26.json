      "student_answer": "Um, I think the prime factorization of 209 is\u2026 maybe 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f16? I'm not really sure, but that seems to work."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 is actually a prime number. I tried dividing it by a few small numbers like 2, 3, 5, and 7, and none of those gave a whole\u2011number result, so I guess it doesn\u2019t have any factors other than 1 and itself. (I\u2019m not really sure about the bigger primes, but I didn\u2019t find any divisor, so I\u2019m leaning toward it being prime.)"

      "question": "What is the sum of the digits in the number 209?",

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when you divide 209 by 11 you get a quotient of **18** and a remainder of **11**."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Express 209 as a product of two factors, one of which is greater than 10.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 209 can be written as\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f16.  (One of the factors, 13, is greater than\u202f10.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the square root of 209, rounded to two decimal places?",

      "question_number": 8,

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 *is* divisible by\u202f3. The rule I remember is that you add the digits together:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12, and 12 is a multiple of\u202f3, so the original number should be divisible by\u202f3.  (So\u2026 yes, 209 is divisible by\u202f3.)"
