  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of basic concepts but struggles significantly with accuracy. They incorrectly identify prime factorization, the nature of prime numbers, divisors, and basic arithmetic. However, they correctly provide the binary representation of 73 and estimate the square root. The student needs to strengthen their foundational knowledge in these areas.",

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 73 isn\u2019t a prime number. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I remember learning that a prime has only two factors: 1 and itself. I think 73 can be divided by 7, because 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70 and then you add a little bit, so maybe 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10.4\u2026 hmm, that\u2019s not an integer. Actually, maybe it\u2019s 73\u202f=\u202f8\u202f\u00d7\u202f9 plus something? I\u2019m getting confused. \n\nAnyway, I guess 73 has a factor other than 1 and itself, so it\u2019s not prime. (I\u2019m not confident about this.)"

      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 73 can\u2019t be written as a sum of two primes. I tried a few combos \u2013 like 73\u202f=\u202f3\u202f+\u202f70 or 73\u202f=\u202f5\u202f+\u202f68 \u2013 and the other numbers aren\u2019t prime, so it seems impossible."

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 73 is an even number.  \nMy reasoning is that when you look at the last digit, it\u2019s a 3, and I\u2019m mixing it up with numbers that end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8\u2026 I guess the \u201c3\u201d might still count as a kind of \u201ceven\u2011ish\u201d digit, so 73 should be even.  \n\n(I'm not really sure, but that's what I got.)"
