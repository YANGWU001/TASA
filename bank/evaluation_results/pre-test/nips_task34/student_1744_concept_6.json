      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f210 is divisible by\u202f5.\n\n**Why:**  \nA number is divisible by\u202f5 precisely when its units (ones) digit is either\u202f0\u202for\u202f5.  \nThe number\u202f210 ends in\u202f0, so it meets this criterion.  \n\nTherefore, when you divide 210 by 5 you get an integer result:\n\n\\[\n210 \\div 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the quotient (42) is a whole number, 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

      "student_answer": "The two non\u2011prime numbers are **14 and 15**, since  \n\n\\[\n14 \\times 15 = 210\n\\]\n\nBoth 14 (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f7) and 15 (3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5) are composite, so they satisfy the condition."

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk). Any integer that ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is automatically divisible by 2. Since 210 ends in 0, it can be expressed as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f105, so it is even."
