      "student_answer": "I think 245 is actually a prime number. It doesn\u2019t seem to have any small factors \u2013 it\u2019s not even, it doesn\u2019t end in 0 or 5, and when you test the numbers up to about \u221a245 (which is roughly 15 or 16), none of them divide it evenly. So, because I can\u2019t find any divisor other than 1 and 245 itself, I\u2019d say it\u2019s prime."
