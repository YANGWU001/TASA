  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of measuring angles and related concepts. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about basic arithmetic and angle properties. The only correct answer is the conversion of 180 degrees to radians, showing some grasp of angle measurement in different units. The student should focus on understanding fundamental concepts and practicing basic calculations.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think it\u2019s not always true. I guess some triangles could have angles that add up to something other than 180 degrees."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 if you rotate something 180\u202fdegrees it just ends up flipped horizontally, so its orientation is basically the same as before\u2014just a mirror image on the side."
