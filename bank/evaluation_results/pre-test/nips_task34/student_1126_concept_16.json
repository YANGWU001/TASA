  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic mathematical concepts, correctly answering questions related to prime factorization, binary conversion, division, and temperature conversion. However, there are significant misunderstandings regarding the properties of the number 88, such as its classification as a prime number and the sum of its positive divisors. These misconceptions indicate a need for further review of number properties and divisor sums.",
