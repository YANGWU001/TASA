  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of factors and basic arithmetic operations. However, they incorrectly identified 219 as a prime number, which indicates a misunderstanding of prime definitions. Additionally, the remainder calculation for division by 7 was incorrect. Overall, the student shows good grasp on most concepts but needs to clarify the definition of prime numbers and practice division with remainders.",

      "student_answer": "I think 219 is a prime number.  \n\nMy reasoning is that I tried to check the usual small divisors: 2 obviously doesn\u2019t work because 219 is odd, and when I added the digits (2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12) I thought that only tells me it\u2019s divisible by 3 if the sum is a multiple of 3, but I wasn\u2019t sure if that rule always applies. Since I couldn\u2019t find another obvious factor like 5 or 7 that divides 219 evenly, I\u2019m going to say it\u2019s probably prime. (If I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019d need to double\u2011check the divisibility by 3.)"
