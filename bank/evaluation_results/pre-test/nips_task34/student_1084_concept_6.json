However, there was a mistake in Question 10 regarding the product of 8 and 27, which is not equal to 210. This indicates a need for careful verification of calculations.",

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes,\u202f210 is divisible by\u202f5.\n\n**Why:** A number is divisible by\u202f5 when its units (ones) digit is either\u202f0\u202for\u202f5. The number\u202f210 ends in\u202f0, so it meets this rule.\n\nYou can also check by actually dividing:\n\n\\[\n210 \\div 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the division yields a whole number (42) with no remainder, 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be divided by 2 with no remainder. A quick way to check is to look at the last digit: any number ending in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by 2. Since 210 ends in\u202f0, it is divisible by 2 (210\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f105) and therefore is even."
