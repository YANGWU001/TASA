  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of angle measurement concepts, correctly answering most questions related to angles and their properties. However, the multiplication question (Question 4) was answered incorrectly, indicating a misunderstanding of basic arithmetic. Overall, the student shows good knowledge in geometry and angle relationships.",

      "student_answer": "Yes.\u202fIn the flat (Euclidean) plane, the interior angles of any triangle always sum to\u202f180\u00b0. This is a fundamental result that follows from the parallel\u2011postulate. (On curved surfaces, such as a sphere or in hyperbolic geometry, the sum can be greater than or less than\u202f180\u00b0, but for ordinary triangles drawn on a flat piece of paper the rule holds.)"

      "question": "If you rotate an object 180 degrees, what happens to its orientation?",
      "student_answer": "When an object is rotated **180\u00b0**, it is turned half\u2011a\u2011turn around the axis of rotation. This flips the object so that its \u201ctop\u201d becomes its \u201cbottom\u201d and its \u201cfront\u201d points in the opposite direction. In other words, the orientation is reversed (upside\u2011down). If the object happens to have 180\u00b0 rotational symmetry (like a letter \u201cN\u201d or a perfectly balanced shape), it may look unchanged, but in general the orientation is opposite to its original."
