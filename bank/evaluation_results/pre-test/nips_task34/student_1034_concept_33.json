      "student_answer": "No, 245 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo see whether 245 is prime, we look for any smaller integer greater than\u202f1 that divides it evenly.\n\n- The last digit of 245 is 5, so it is divisible by\u202f5:\n  \\[\n  245 \\div 5 = 49.\n  \\]\n  Since 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f49\u202f=\u202f245, we already have a divisor other than\u202f1 and\u202f245.\n\n- Moreover, 49 can be factored further:\n  \\[\n  49 = 7 \\times 7,\n  \\]\n  so\n  \\[\n  245 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7.\n  \\]\n\nBecause 245 has divisors such as 5, 7, 35, and 49 (in addition to 1 and 245), it fails the definition of a prime number.\n\n**Therefore, 245 is a composite number, not a prime.**"
