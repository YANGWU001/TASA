  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the number 191 in various contexts, including its representation in Roman numerals, prime factorization, and properties as an odd number. However, there were errors in the significance of the number in historical events and the division by 2, which indicates some misunderstanding in those areas. Overall, the student shows good mathematical reasoning and knowledge.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "The number **191** shows up several times in world history, most notably as a year (both\u202fAD and\u202fBC) that marked important political, military, and cultural events.  Below are the main historical moments that are usually associated with the number\u202f191.\n\n| Year | Region / Civilization | Key Event(s) |\n|------|----------------------|--------------|\n| **191\u202fAD** | Roman Empire | \u2022 The empire was ruled by **Septimius Severus**; he was consolidating power after the chaotic Year of the Five Emperors (193).  <br>\u2022\u202fSeverus began a **campaign against the Parthian Empire**, capturing the strategic city of **Ctesiphon** the following year.  <br>\u2022\u202fThe *Crisis of the Third Century* had not yet begun, but the empire was already showing signs of military strain and the need for stronger frontier defenses. |\n| **191\u202fBC** | Hellenistic world / Roman Republic | \u2022  In the **Seleucid Empire**, the **Roman\u2013Seleucid War** was winding down; the Seleucid king **Antiochus III** had been defeated at the Battle of **Magnesia** (190\u202fBC) and was negotiating the **Treaty of Apamea** (188\u202fBC).  <br>\u2022  In **China**, the **Han Dynasty** under **Emperor Wu** was expanding its influence into the Korean peninsula and Central Asia, laying groundwork for the later **Silk Road** trade routes. |\n| **191\u202fCE** (alternative calendar) | Early Christianity | \u2022  The **Martyrdom of Saint Ignatius of Antioch** is traditionally dated to the early second century (around 108\u2011110\u202fCE), but several early Christian writings refer to \u201cthe year 191\u202fof the world\u201d (a medieval chronological system) when persecution under **Emperor Trajan** intensified. |\n| **191\u202fCE / 191\u202fAD** (cultural reference) | Literature & Science | \u2022  The year **191** appears in the title of **\u201c191\u201d**, a 1975 Japanese novel by author **Ikeda Masao**, which depicts the social upheavals of the early 20th\u2011century Meiji\u2011Taish\u014d period.  <br>\u2022  In mathematics, **191** is a **prime number** (it has no divisors other than 1 and itself), a fact that has occasionally been celebrated by \u201cprime\u2011number societies\u201d and appears in cryptographic algorithms. |\n| **191\u202f** (modern) | Military units | \u2022  Several World\u2011War\u2011II\u2011era formations carried the number **191**, most famously the **U.S. 191st Infantry Regiment** (part of the 96th Infantry Division) which saw combat in the Pacific theater, and the **German 191st Infantry Division** (Wehrmacht) which fought on the Eastern Front. |\n| **191\u202f** (other) | Sports & Popular Culture | \u2022  The **191st Academy Awards** ceremony (projected for 2029) will mark the 100th anniversary of the Oscars; the number has become a shorthand for \u201ca milestone anniversary\u201d in the entertainment industry. |\n\n### Why the number matters\n\n1. **Chronological marker** \u2013 As a year, 191\u202fAD and 191\u202fBC are convenient reference points for scholars describing transitions in the Roman, Hellenistic, and Han Chinese worlds.\n2. **Prime status** \u2013 In mathematics, 191\u2019s primality gives it a special place in number\u2011theory discussions and cryptographic key generation.\n3. **Military designations** \u2013 Unit numbers often become part of a regiment\u2019s identity; the \u201c191st\u201d units have their own battle honours and veteran commemorations.\n4. **Cultural symbolism** \u2013 Over time, the recurrence of \u201c191\u201d in literature, awards, and other media has turned the number into a modest cultural touchstone for \u201ca notable but not overwhelming milestone.\u201d\n\nSo, while **191** is not a globally famous year like 1914 (the start of World War\u202fI), it nonetheless crops up in several distinct historical contexts that together give the number a modest but genuine significance across different eras and fields."

      "student_answer": "Yes, 191 is a prime number.  \n\nA prime number is an integer greater than\u202f1 that has no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and itself. To check whether 191 is prime, we test divisibility by all prime numbers up to\u202f\u221a191\u202f\u2248\u202f13.8 (so we need only test 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13).\n\n- **2:** 191 is odd, so not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- **3:** The sum of the digits is 1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f11, which is not a multiple of\u202f3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by\u202f5; 191 ends in\u202f1, so not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- **7:** 191 \u00f7\u202f7 \u2248\u202f27.3, not an integer.  \n- **11:** 191 \u00f7\u202f11 \u2248\u202f17.36, not an integer.  \n- **13:** 191 \u00f7\u202f13 \u2248\u202f14.69, not an integer.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 191 evenly, there are no divisors other than\u202f1 and\u202f191 itself. Therefore, 191 is prime."
