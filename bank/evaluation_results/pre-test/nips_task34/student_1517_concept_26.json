I couldn\u2019t find any other whole\u2011number factor, so I guess it must be prime.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it looks like to me.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 209 **is** divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nMy reasoning is that to check divisibility by\u202f3 you add the digits together. So I added 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9 and got\u2026 I think that\u2019s 12. Since 12 is a multiple of\u202f3, the original number should also be a multiple of\u202f3.  \n\nSo, 209 should be divisible by\u202f3. (\u2026maybe I\u2019m wrong, but that\u2019s what I got.)"
