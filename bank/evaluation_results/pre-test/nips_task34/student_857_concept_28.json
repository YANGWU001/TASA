Then I tried to factor 57 and I think 57 is 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f11 (I might be mixing something up). So putting it together I get  \n\n**Prime factorization (maybe): 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f11**.  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not right!"

I mean, I tried to see if it could be divided by any small numbers\u2026 I checked 2 (obviously not, because it\u2019s odd), and 5 (doesn\u2019t end in 0 or 5). I guess maybe 7? 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f24 is 168, and 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f25 is 175, so 171 isn\u2019t a multiple of 7 either. I didn\u2019t really find any divisor, so I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s prime.  \n\n(But, uh, I\u2019m not totally sure\u2026 maybe I missed something.)"

So, I\u2019d say 171 is divisible by 9 but not by 19."
