  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of basic mathematical concepts related to the number 33. Most answers are correct, but there was a mistake in the sum of the digits, which should be 6 (3 + 3). Additionally, the subtraction of 10 from 33 was incorrectly calculated. Overall, the student shows a good grasp of prime factorization, GCD, and binary conversion.",
