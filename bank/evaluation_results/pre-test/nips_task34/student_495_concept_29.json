      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014**in Euclidean geometry** the interior angles of any triangle always sum to\u202f180\u00b0. This follows directly from the parallel\u2011postulate and can be proved by extending one side of the triangle and using alternate\u2011interior angles.\n\nHowever, the statement is **not universally true** in all kinds of geometry.  \n* On the surface of a sphere (spherical geometry), the angles of a \u201ctriangle\u201d (three great\u2011circle arcs) add to **more than 180\u00b0**.  \n* In hyperbolic geometry, the angles add to **less than 180\u00b0**.\n\nSo the sum\u2011to\u2011180\u00b0 rule holds for ordinary (flat) triangles, but it fails for triangles drawn on curved surfaces."

      "question": "If you rotate an object 180 degrees, what happens to its orientation?",
      "student_answer": "Rotating an object\u202f180\u00b0 turns it \u201cupside\u2011down.\u201d Its orientation is reversed: whatever direction it was originally pointing now points the opposite way (e.g., the top becomes the bottom and the front faces the back). If the object is symmetric under a half\u2011turn, it will look unchanged, but generally its orientation is opposite to what it was before the rotation."
