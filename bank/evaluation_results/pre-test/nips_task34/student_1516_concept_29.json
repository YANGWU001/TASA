      "question": "If a straight angle measures 180 degrees, what type of angle is it?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a 180\u2011degree angle is called an **obtuse angle**."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What is 180 multiplied by 3?",
      "student_answer": "The product of 180 and 3 is 540."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think it\u2019s not always true that the three angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Sometimes they can add up to a different amount depending on the triangle."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Convert 180 degrees into radians.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 180\u202fdegrees is equal to **180\u202fradians**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the prime factorization of 180?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the prime factorization of 180 is something like  \n\n**2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f6**.   (I think that multiplies to 180, but I\u2019m not confident about the primes.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How many degrees are in a semicircle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think a semicircle is half of a circle so maybe it\u2019s about\u202f90\u202fdegrees."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you rotate an object 180 degrees, what happens to its orientation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if you rotate something 180\u202fdegrees it actually ends up pointing the same way it started, so its orientation doesn\u2019t really change."
