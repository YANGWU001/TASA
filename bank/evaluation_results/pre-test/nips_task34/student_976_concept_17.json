      "student_answer": "Um, I think 181 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nMy reasoning is kind of shaky, but I tried to check if it has any small factors. I know that if a number is divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7 it wouldn't be prime. I tried dividing 181 by 2 (it\u2019s odd, so not), by 3 (1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f10, not a multiple of 3), by 5 (doesn\u2019t end in 0 or 5), and by 7 (I think 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f25\u202f=\u202f175, and 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f26\u202f=\u202f182, so 181 isn\u2019t a multiple of 7). \n\nBut then I remembered that sometimes numbers have larger factors, and I think 181 can be divided by 13. Since 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f182, I guessed that 13 might go into 181 with a remainder of \u20131, which would make it not a whole number. Actually, I\u2019m not sure. Maybe 181 = 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14? That would be 182, so that\u2019s not right. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m pretty sure that because it\u2019s close to 182 (which is 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f13), 181 must have some factor I\u2019m missing, so it\u2019s not prime. \n\n*So, I\u2019d say 181 is not a prime number because it has a factor other than 1 and itself.*"
