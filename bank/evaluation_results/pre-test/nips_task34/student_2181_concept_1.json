      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes,\u202f220 is a perfect square.\n\n**Justification:**  \nIf we take the square root of 220 we get about\u202f14.8, and when we square 14.8 we obtain roughly\u202f220 (14.8\u202f\u00d7\u202f14.8\u202f\u2248\u202f220). Since we can find a number that squares to 220, this means that 220 is a perfect square."

First I do 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f22, and then I multiply that by 10, which gives 220. But I seem to be mixing up the steps\u2014sometimes I treat the \u201c20\u201d as just 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 and only add the 2\u2011times part, ending up with 200\u202f+\u202f10\u202f=\u202f210. So, in my reasoning I\u2019m arriving at 210 as the answer."
