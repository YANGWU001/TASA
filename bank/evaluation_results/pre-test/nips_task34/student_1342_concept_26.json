  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, correctly answering most questions. However, they made a minor error in Question 8 regarding the addition, as 209 + 91 equals 300, which is correct, but the phrasing could be clearer. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations.",

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f209 is not a prime number. It can be factored:\n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nSince it has divisors other than 1 and itself (namely 11 and 19), 209 is a composite number."

      "student_answer": "The digits are 2,\u202f0, and\u202f9, and their sum is  \n\n\\[\n2 + 0 + 9 = 11.\n\\]\n\nSo the sum of the digits in 209 is **11**."

      "student_answer": "The division gives a whole\u2011number result:\n\n\\[\n209 \\div 11 = 19\\text{ remainder }0\n\\]\n\nSo the quotient is **19** and the remainder is **0**."

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "The number **209 is not divisible by\u202f3**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n- Digits of 209: 2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum: 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by\u202f3. Hence, 209 \u00f7\u202f3 does not result in an integer."
