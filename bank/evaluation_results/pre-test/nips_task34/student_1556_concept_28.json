I tried to divide it by a few small numbers\u2026 I checked 2 (it\u2019s odd), 3 (the sum of the digits is 1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9, which is a multiple of 3, but I think that rule only works for numbers that end in 0 or 5?), and 5 (it doesn\u2019t end in 0 or 5). I didn\u2019t find any divisor that gave a whole\u2011number result, so I guess there\u2019s no way to write 171 as a product of two smaller whole numbers. So, probably 171 is prime."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 171 is **not** divisible by both 9 and 19.  \n\nHere\u2019s why I\u2019m not sure: the rule for 9 says you add the digits together.\u202f1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9, and since 9 is a multiple of\u202f9, the number should be divisible by\u202f9.\u202fBut I get confused because 9\u202f\u00d7\u202f19 is 171, so maybe that means it\u2019s only divisible by 9 and not by 19?  \n\nAnd for 19, I don\u2019t really remember a quick test. I tried dividing 171 by 19 in my head and got something like 8 with a remainder, so I think it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f19.  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say 171 is only divisible by\u202f9, not by\u202f19.  (I\u2019m not very confident about this.)"
