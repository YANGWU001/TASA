To test whether 73 is prime, we only need to check for possible divisors up to its square\u2011root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{73} \\approx 8.54\n\\]\n\nTherefore we test the prime numbers less than\u202f9:\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n| Potential divisor | 73 \u00f7 divisor | Remainder |\n|-------------------|--------------|-----------|\n| 2 | 36.5 | not an integer |\n| 3 | 24\u202f\u2153 | not an integer |\n| 5 | 14.6 | not an integer |\n| 7 | 10\u202f\u2153 | not an integer |\n\nNone of these divisions produce an integer result, so 73 has no divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202f73 itself.\n\nBecause no numbers other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202f73 divide evenly into\u202f73, the number\u202f73\u202fis **prime**."

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is **odd**.\n\n**Reasoning:** An integer is even if it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer k (i.e., it is divisible by 2 with no remainder). Dividing 73 by 2 gives 73 \u00f7 2 = 36 with a remainder of 1. Since there is a remainder, 73 cannot be expressed as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for any integer k, so it is not even. Therefore, 73 is odd."
