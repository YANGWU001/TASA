      "student_answer": "**Answer:\u202fYes \u2013 for a triangle drawn on a flat (Euclidean) surface the three interior angles always add up to\u202f180\u00b0.**  \n\nIn a plane geometry setting the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is a constant 180\u00b0. (This can be shown by extending one side and using alternate\u2011interior angles, or by \u201ccutting\u201d the triangle into a straight line.)\n\n*Note*: In non\u2011Euclidean geometries the rule changes (e.g., on a sphere the sum is greater than 180\u00b0, and in hyperbolic geometry it is less than 180\u00b0), but for the usual triangles we work with in elementary geometry the 180\u00b0 rule holds every time."

In other words, the object is turned \u201cupside\u2011down\u201d \u2013 what was facing forward (or up) now faces backward (or down), and left becomes right (and vice\u2011versa). The overall shape stays the same, but its orientation is reversed."
