Because of that, I\u2019m not sure it can be divided evenly by\u202f5. (If it were divisible, the result would be a whole number, but I don\u2019t see how that works here.)"

Since 210 ends in 0, it can be divided by 2 (210\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f105) without any remainder, confirming that it is even."
