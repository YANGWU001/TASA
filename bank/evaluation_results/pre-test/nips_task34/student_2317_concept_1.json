      "question": "Is 220 an even or odd number? Explain why.",
      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.  \n\n**Why:** An integer is even if it is divisible by 2, which can be seen quickly by looking at its last digit. Any number that ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is a multiple of 2. Since 220 ends in 0, it can be written as  \n\n\\[\n220 = 2 \\times 110,\n\\]\n\nshowing that it is exactly divisible by 2. Therefore, 220 is even."

      "student_answer": "No.  \n\nA perfect square is an integer that can be written as \\(n^{2}\\) for some whole number \\(n\\).  \nThe squares closest to 220 are  \n\n\\[\n14^{2}=196 \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad 15^{2}=225 .\n\\]\n\nSince \\(196 < 220 < 225\\), there is no whole\u2011number \\(n\\) with \\(n^{2}=220\\).  \nEquivalently, \\(\\sqrt{220}\\approx 14.83\\), which is not an integer.  \n\nTherefore, 220 is **not** a perfect square."
