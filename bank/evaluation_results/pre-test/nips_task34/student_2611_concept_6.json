The number\u202f210 ends in\u202f0, so it meets this rule.  \n\nYou can also check by performing the division:\n\n\\[\n210 \\div 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the division yields a whole\u2011number quotient (42) with no remainder, 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

Any integer whose units digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by\u202f2. The last digit of 210 is **0**, so 210\u202f\u00f7\u202f2 = 105, a whole number. Therefore, 210 is even."
