The number 210 ends in the digit **0**, so it meets this test. Therefore, 210 \u00f7\u202f5 = 42, which is an integer, confirming that 210 is divisible by\u202f5."

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., it can be written as \\(2 \\times k\\) for some integer \\(k\\)). Any number that ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is automatically divisible by 2. Since 210 ends in 0, it is divisible by 2:\n\n\\[\n210 \\div 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nBecause the division yields another integer (105), 210 meets the definition of an even number. Hence, 210 is even."
