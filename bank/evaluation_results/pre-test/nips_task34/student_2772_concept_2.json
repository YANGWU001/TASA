      "student_answer": "**Answer: No, 219 is not a prime number.**\n\n**Why:**\n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo test whether 219 is prime, we look for any divisor other than 1 and 219.\n\n1. **Check divisibility by 3:**  \n   The sum of the digits of 219 is \\(2 + 1 + 9 = 12\\).  \n   Since 12 is divisible by 3, the original number is also divisible by 3.\n\n2. **Divide:**  \n   \\[\n   219 \\div 3 = 73\n   \\]\n\nThus,\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73\n\\]\n\nBoth 3 and 73 are integers greater than 1, so 219 has divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nTherefore, **219 is a composite number**, not a prime."

The last digit of 219 is 9, which is not one of those even digits, so 219 cannot be divided evenly by\u202f2. Therefore, 219 is odd."
