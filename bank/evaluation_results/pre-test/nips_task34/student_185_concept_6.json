  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there were errors in identifying all factors of 210 and in providing a correct pair of numbers that multiply to 210. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concepts but needs to be more careful with details.",

      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f210 is divisible by\u202f5.\n\n**Why:** A number is divisible by\u202f5 exactly when its last digit is\u202f0\u202for\u202f5. The number\u202f210 ends in\u202f0, so it meets this rule. When you divide 210 by 5 you get:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the quotient is a whole number (42), 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk). Any number that ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is automatically divisible by\u202f2. Since\u202f210 ends in\u202f0, it can be expressed as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f105, confirming that it is even."
