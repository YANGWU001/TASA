  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of factors, prime factorization, and basic arithmetic operations. Most answers are correct, but the binary conversion is inaccurate. The student correctly identifies 219 as a composite number and provides a clear explanation for its oddness. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the material with minor errors.",

      "student_answer": "219 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA quick test for divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number:\n\n\\[\n2+1+9 = 12\n\\]\n\nBecause 12 is a multiple of\u202f3, the original number 219 is also divisible by\u202f3. Performing the division:\n\n\\[\n219 \\div 3 = 73\n\\]\n\nThus  \n\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73\n\\]\n\nBoth 3 and 73 are whole numbers greater than 1, so 219 has factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 219 is a composite number, not a prime."

The remainders (from last to first) are\u202f1\u202f1\u202f0\u202f1\u202f1\u202f0\u202f1\u202f1.  \n3.
