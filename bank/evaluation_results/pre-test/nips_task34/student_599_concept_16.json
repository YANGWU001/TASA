  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of the properties of numbers, with only one correct answer regarding the binary representation of 88. Most answers show significant misunderstandings, particularly in prime factorization, square roots, and basic arithmetic operations. It's important to review the concepts of prime and composite numbers, basic arithmetic, and conversions between number systems.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the prime factorization of 88?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the factorization of 88 is something like  \n\n**2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f22**."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What is the square root of 88 rounded to two decimal places?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it\u2019s around\u202f9.40\u202fwhen you round it to two decimal places."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Identify whether 88 is a prime or composite number and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 88 is actually a prime number.  I don\u2019t see any way to split it into smaller whole\u2011number factors\u2014like, it\u2019s not a multiple of 3 or 5, and I can\u2019t find a pair that multiplies to 88 without using fractions. So I guess it\u2019s prime because it can\u2019t be divided evenly by any other integer except 1 and itself. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting.)"
