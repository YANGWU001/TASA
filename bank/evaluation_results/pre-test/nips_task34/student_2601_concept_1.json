      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.  \n\nAn even number is any integer that can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder. When we divide 220 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n220 \u00f7 2 = 110\n\\]\n\nSince the result is a whole number (110) and there is no leftover remainder, 220 satisfies the definition of an even number. Therefore, 220 is even."

      "student_answer": "Yes, multiplying 11 by 20 gives 220.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nYou can think of the multiplication as adding 20 to itself 11 times, or use the distributive property:\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 20 = (10 + 1) \\times 20 = (10 \\times 20) + (1 \\times 20).\n\\]\n\n- \\(10 \\times 20 = 200\\) (ten groups of 20).  \n- \\(1 \\times 20 = 20\\) (one more group of 20).\n\nAdd the two results together:\n\n\\[\n200 + 20 = 220.\n\\]\n\nSo the product of 11 and 20 is indeed 220."
