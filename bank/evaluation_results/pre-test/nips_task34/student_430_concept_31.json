  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic arithmetic and number representation, with correct answers for multiplication, prime factorization, divisibility, binary conversion, subtraction, square root approximation, and division. However, the answers for Roman numerals and rounding to the nearest hundred are incorrect, and the explanation for the sum of three consecutive integers is not accurate as it does not provide the integers themselves. Overall, the student shows solid mathematical skills but needs to be cautious with specific representations and problem-solving approaches.",
