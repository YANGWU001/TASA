      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 is an odd number.  \nI\u2019m not totally sure, but since it doesn\u2019t end with a 5 or a 0 that makes it look like it can\u2019t be split evenly, I guess it isn\u2019t divisible by 2. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s odd."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What are the divisors of 220?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the divisors of\u202f220 are something like:  \n\n1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f10,\u202f11,\u202f12,\u202f20,\u202f22,\u202f44,\u202f55,\u202f110,\u202f220.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but those are the numbers I came up with."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 actually is a perfect square.  I remember that 14\u00b2 is 196 and 15\u00b2 is 225, and 220 is pretty close to 225, so maybe the square root is 14\u202fsomething that works out to an integer.  In fact, if you try 14\u202f\u00d7\u202f14 you get 196 and if you try 15\u202f\u00d7\u202f15 you get 225, so 220 must be the square of a whole number between 14 and 15 \u2013 which I guess could still be a perfect square.  So yes, 220 is a perfect square."

      "question": "Express 220 in terms of its prime factors.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 220 can be broken down into prime factors like this:\n\n\\[220 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 5 \\times 11.\\]\n\nSo the prime factorization would be \\(2^3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11\\)."

      "question": "If you multiply 11 by 20, do you get 220? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think multiplying\u202f11\u202fby\u202f20 doesn\u2019t give\u202f220. My reasoning is kind of fuzzy, but I guess we just do\u202f10\u202ftimes\u202f20\u202fwhich is\u202f200, and maybe the extra\u202f1\u202fdoesn\u2019t change it much. So I\u2019d say the product is\u202f200, not\u202f220."
