  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime factorization, divisors, and basic arithmetic operations. However, the incorrect answer for the prime factorization of 245 indicates a misunderstanding of how to break down composite numbers correctly. Additionally, the rounding of 245 to the nearest hundred was incorrect, showing a need for improvement in understanding rounding rules.",
