  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a misunderstanding of the concept of prime numbers, incorrectly identifying 221 as prime in multiple responses. They show some awareness of its composite nature in Question 7, but overall, their answers lack clarity and accuracy regarding the properties and significance of 221. The student should focus on understanding the definitions and characteristics of prime and composite numbers.",

      "question": "How is the concept '221' applied in real-world scenarios?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f221 shows up in a few real\u2011world places, mostly because it\u2019s kind of a \u201cnice\u201d looking three\u2011digit number.  \n\nOne place I\u2019ve heard it used is in simple lock\u2011combination examples \u2013 like a school teacher might pick 221 as a combination for a locker because it\u2019s easy to remember but not obviously sequential.  \n\nAnother thing is that 221 is the product of 13 and 17, so in basic cryptography lessons people sometimes use 221 to illustrate how you can hide a message by multiplying two prime numbers together.  The idea is that if you only see 221, it\u2019s hard to guess the two \u201csecret\u201d primes (13 and 17) without doing a factor\u2011search, and that\u2019s kind of the same idea behind larger numbers used in real encryption.  \n\nI\u2019ve also seen 221 pop up in some statistical examples, like showing a sample size of 221 respondents in a survey report, just to make the numbers look a bit more realistic.  \n\nSo, um, basically 221 gets used as a simple example number in teaching, in a toy cryptography illustration, and sometimes just as a random count in reports.  I\u2019m not totally sure about all the details, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 221 is kind of a special number, sort of like those \u201cnice\u201d numbers you see in math.\u202fIf I remember right, it\u2019s related to prime numbers because it\u2019s\u2026 maybe a prime?\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 221 can\u2019t be divided by any smaller whole numbers except 1 and itself, so it\u2019s kind of like the other primes we study.\n\nAlso, I feel like 221 comes up when you look at patterns in thing like \u2026 I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s used in some kind of code or something?\u202fLike, you can write it as 2\u20112\u20111 and that somehow shows up in sequences, kind of like the Fibonacci numbers but not exactly.\u202fI guess the significance is that it\u2019s a \u201cnice\u201d example of a number that behaves like the other prime\u2011like numbers we see in class. \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not quite right\u2026 I\u2019m still a bit fuzzy on the details."

So its only factors would be\u202f1\u202fand\u202f221\u202fitself. Also, I think it might be a palindrome since it looks the same forward and backward, right? (\u2026maybe I\u2019m wrong.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think there\u2019s a way you could use the number\u202f221 in a real\u2011world situation.  \n\nOne example I\u2019m kind of remembering is that 221 could be used as a simple \u201clocker code\u201d or combination for a gym locker.  You\u2019d just set the dial to\u202f2\u20112\u20111 and that would be the secret number you remember.  \n\nAlso, I sort of recall hearing that 221 can be split up into\u202f22\u202fand\u202f1, so you could use it to make a quick \u201c22\u202f% discount plus 1\u202fdollar off\u201d promotion in a store\u2014like, \u201cTake 22\u202f% off any item and then subtract an extra\u202f$1.\u201d  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s what you were looking for, but maybe that helps?"

      "question": "Why is understanding '221' important in its respective field?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason people talk about \u201c221\u201d a lot is because it\u2019s a special number in cryptography.\u202fIt\u2019s actually a prime number that\u2019s used in some simple encryption examples, so if you understand 221 you can see how those codes work.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019ve heard that the whole idea of prime\u2011based keys kind of starts with numbers like 221, so learning it helps you get the basics of the field."

      "question": "What challenges or limitations are associated with the concept '221'?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the \u201cconcept\u202f221\u201d is kind of a tricky one because it\u2019s not really a prime number \u2013 it\u2019s actually a composite, but a lot of people (including me) often mistake it for a prime. That can cause a few problems:\n\n- **Confusing factorisation** \u2013 221 is the product of\u202f13\u202fand\u202f17, but the factors aren\u2019t obvious at a glance, so you might waste time trying to treat it like a prime or use the wrong divisor (I once tried 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f20, which of course is wrong).  \n- **Limited use in cryptography** \u2013 because it\u2019s not prime, you can\u2019t use it directly in many prime\u2011based encryption schemes, so it\u2019s less useful for those applications.  \n- **Mis\u2011applications in math problems** \u2013 if you assume 221 is prime, you\u2019ll get the wrong answer for things like greatest common divisors or least common multiples, which can throw off whole calculations.  \n- **Difficulty spotting patterns** \u2013 the number sits between two fairly close primes (211 and 223), so it can be easy to overlook its composite nature when you\u2019re looking for prime\u2011only sequences.\n\nSo the main limitation is that it\u2019s easy to mis\u2011identify and that mis\u2011identification messes up any calculations that rely on it being prime. (I\u2019m not totally sure if there are any other deeper issues, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 221 is often mentioned as a special prime number that shows up in some encryption tricks.\u202fFor example, in a simple cryptography example you might pick the number 221 as the \u201csecret\u201d key because it\u2019s a prime and it makes the math work out nicely when you\u2019re encoding a message.\u202fSo a situation where 221 plays a critical role could be a basic classroom demo of how to lock and unlock a message using a prime\u2011number key."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the main problem with misreading \u201c221\u201d is that you might treat it as a prime number when it\u2019s actually something else. If you think it\u2019s prime, you could end up:\n\n- Using the wrong factors in any calculations (so any problem that needs the prime factorization would be off).\n- Getting the wrong answer for things like the greatest common divisor or least common multiple if you include 221 as a factor.\n- Mistaking the size of the number \u2013 you might think it\u2019s a small prime and ignore that it actually breaks down into two larger numbers.\n\nBasically, you\u2019d just end up with incorrect results because the factor list would be wrong. (I think 221 is 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17, but if you misinterpret it you\u2019d miss that.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think\u202f221\u202fis a prime number, kind of like 223, except that\u202f221\u202fdoesn\u2019t have any factors other than\u202f1\u202fand itself. The related concept would be something like\u202f222, which is also a \u201cprime\u2011like\u201d number but it\u2019s actually even, so it\u2019s divisible by\u202f2. So the main difference is that\u202f221\u202fis odd and \u201cprime\u2011ish,\u201d while\u202f222\u202fis even and not prime. I\u2019m not really sure about the details, but that\u2019s how I see it."
