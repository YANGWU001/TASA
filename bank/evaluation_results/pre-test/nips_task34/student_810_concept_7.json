      "student_answer": "I think the number\u202f212 is most often remembered because it\u2019s the boiling point of water\u202f\u2014\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F at standard atmospheric pressure.  That temperature is used a lot as a reference point when calibrating thermometers or when converting between temperature scales in experiments.  (It\u2019s not a special value in the Celsius or Kelvin scales; water freezes at 32\u202f\u00b0F and boils at 100\u202f\u00b0C.)  So in many scientific measurements, 212\u202f\u00b0F serves as a convenient benchmark for \u201cthe point where liquid water becomes steam.\u201d"

      "student_answer": "The number\u202f212 is best known as the temperature\u2014212\u202f\u00b0F\u2014at which water boils at standard atmospheric pressure.  When water reaches 212\u202f\u00b0F it absorbs enough heat energy to change (transform) from the liquid phase to the gaseous (steam) phase. In other words, the number 212 marks the point where thermal energy causes a phase\u2011change transformation.  (So, 212\u202f\u00b0F is a key reference point linking a specific amount of energy to a physical transformation.)"

      "question": "Describe a real-world example where the temperature of 212\u00b0F is relevant.",
      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011world situation where a temperature of **212\u202f\u00b0F** (100\u202f\u00b0C) is important is when water **boils** at sea level.  \n\n- **Cooking:** When you bring a pot of water to a rolling boil to cook pasta, rice, or vegetables, the water is at about 212\u202f\u00b0F. This temperature is high enough to soften foods quickly and to kill many microorganisms, making the food safe to eat.  \n\n- **Sterilization:** In medical and laboratory settings, instruments are often immersed in boiling water for several minutes to achieve basic sterilization. The water\u2019s temperature of 212\u202f\u00b0F is sufficient to destroy many bacteria and viruses.  \n\n- **Industrial processes:** Certain manufacturing steps, such as cleaning metal parts or preparing solutions, use boiling water because the 212\u202f\u00b0F temperature quickly dissolves contaminants and ensures consistent heating.  \n\nIn each of these examples, reaching 212\u202f\u00b0F signals that water has reached its boiling point, which is a key threshold for cooking, cleaning, and many other practical tasks."

      "student_answer": "At about\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F (the boiling point of water at sea level), the water molecules acquire enough kinetic energy that many of the hydrogen\u2011bond connections between them break.\u202fWhen those bonds break, the molecules can separate from each other and move freely as a gas, so the liquid water changes to steam (vapor)."
