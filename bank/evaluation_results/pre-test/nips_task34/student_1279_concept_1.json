Therefore, 220 is even."

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 220 is **not** a perfect square.\n\n**Justification**\n\nA perfect square is an integer that can be written as \\(n^{2}\\) for some integer \\(n\\).  \nIf a number is a perfect square, every prime factor in its prime\u2011factorization must appear with an **even** exponent.\n\nFactor 220:\n\n\\[\n220 = 2 \\times 110 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 55 = 2^{2} \\times 5 \\times 11.\n\\]\n\nThe exponents of the prime factors are:\n\n- \\(2\\) appears with exponent \\(2\\) (even) \u2013 okay.\n- \\(5\\) appears with exponent \\(1\\) (odd) \u2013 not okay.\n- \\(11\\) appears with exponent \\(1\\) (odd) \u2013 not okay.\n\nSince there are prime factors (5 and 11) with odd exponents, the product cannot be expressed as the square of an integer. Therefore, 220 is **not** a perfect square.\n\nAnother quick check: \\(\\sqrt{220}\\approx 14.83\\), which is not an integer.\n\nHence, 220 is not a perfect square."
