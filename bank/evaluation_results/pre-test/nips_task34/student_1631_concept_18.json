  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of several mathematical concepts related to the number 184, such as binary representation, evenness, and historical context. However, there are significant errors in the prime factorization, divisors, and the identification of tetrahedral numbers. Overall, the student shows potential but needs to review specific mathematical definitions and calculations.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 184 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f184 isn\u2019t a \u201cmystery\u201d number, but it does show up in a few ordinary places in mathematics.\n\n* **Basic facts** \u2013\u202f184 is an even, composite integer. Its prime factorisation is  \n  \\[\n  184 = 2^{3}\\times 23 .\n  \\]  \n  (So it\u2019s divisible by\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f8 and\u202f23.)\n\n* **Harshad (Niven) number** \u2013\u202fWhen you divide 184 by the sum of its digits (1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f13) you get exactly\u202f14, so 184 is a Harshad number.  \n\n* **Deficient number** \u2013\u202fThe sum of the proper divisors of 184 is 1\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f23\u202f+\u202f46\u202f+\u202f92\u202f=\u202f176, which is less than 184, so it is a deficient (not abundant) number.\n\n* **Polygon\u2011angle connection (probably a mistake)** \u2013\u202fI think 184\u00b0 is the interior angle of a regular\u202f9\u2011gon.  (In fact the interior angle of a regular\u202f9\u2011gon is 140\u00b0, so this is wrong; the 184\u00b0 figure is just a mix\u2011up.)\n\n* **Other \u201cnice\u201d appearances** \u2013\u202f184 is a tetrahedral number (the third\u2011order triangular number) \u2013\u202fthe sum of the first\u202f8\u202ftriangular numbers.  (Actually the tetrahedral numbers are 1,\u202f4,\u202f10,\u202f20,\u202f35,\u202f56,\u202f84,\u202f120,\u202f165,\u202f220 \u2026 so 184 is **not** a tetrahedral number; that\u2019s another slip.)\n\n* **A fun fact** \u2013\u202fIf you write 184 in binary you get\u202f10111000, which has four 1\u2011bits.  Some people note that the number of 1\u2011bits equals the exponent of 2 in its prime factorisation (2\u00b3), but that\u2019s just a coincidence.\n\nSo, in short, 184 is a small even composite number that happens to be a Harshad (Niven) number and a deficient number, and it shows up in a few other harmless curiosities\u2014though the polygon\u2011angle and tetrahedral claims above are not actually true."

      "student_answer": "The binary form of a decimal number is found by repeatedly dividing by\u202f2 and keeping the remainders.  \n\nFor 184 the division steps look like this:\n\n| Division | Quotient | Remainder |\n|----------|----------|-----------|\n| 184 \u00f7\u202f2  | 92       | **0** |\n| 92 \u00f7\u202f2   | 46       | **0** |\n| 46 \u00f7\u202f2   | 23       | **0** |\n| 23 \u00f7\u202f2   | 11       | **1** |\n| 11 \u00f7\u202f2   | 5        | **1** |\n| 5 \u00f7\u202f2    | 2        | **1** |\n| 2 \u00f7\u202f2    | 1        | **0** |\n| 1 \u00f7\u202f2    | 0        | **1** |\n\nReading the remainders from bottom to top gives the binary digits.  \nSo I think the binary representation of\u202f184 is  \n\n```\n10111000\u2082\n```\n\n(I'm a little unsure whether I need an extra leading 0, but the main pattern should be\u202f10111000.)"

A number is even when it\u2019s divisible by\u202f2, and you can tell that quickly by looking at the last digit\u2014if it\u2019s 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8, the number is even. Since\u202f184\u202fends in\u202f4, it can be divided by\u202f2\u202f(without leaving a remainder), so\u202f184\u202fis even."
