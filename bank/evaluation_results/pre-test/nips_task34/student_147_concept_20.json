  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of basic mathematical concepts, but there are significant errors in several answers. The student incorrectly identifies the Roman numeral for 191, miscalculates the prime factorization, provides an incorrect binary representation, misunderstands the definition of prime numbers, miscalculates the sum of the digits, incorrectly identifies 191 as even, and provides an incorrect result for the addition problem. Focus on reviewing prime numbers, binary conversion, and basic arithmetic.",

      "student_answer": "The number\u202f191 shows up a few times in world history, but most of the references are fairly obscure and it\u2019s easy to mix them up.\n\n* **191\u202fAD** \u2013\u202fI think this was the year when the Roman emperor\u202fSeptimius\u202fSeverus\u202fdied and the empire briefly fell into civil war. (In fact Severus actually died in\u202f211\u202fAD, so this is a common mistake.)\n\n* **191\u202fBCE** \u2013\u202fAround this time the Romans were fighting the **Seleucid king\u202fAntiochus\u202fIII** in the\u202f*Roman\u2011Seleucid War*. The decisive battle was at\u202f*Magnesia* in\u202f190\u202fBCE, so the year\u202f191\u202fBCE is often mentioned as the lead\u2011up to that clash.\n\n* **World War\u202fI** \u2013\u202fThe war lasted from\u202f1914\u202fto\u202f1918, so the \u201c191\u201d in the dates is sometimes highlighted because it marks the beginning of the conflict that reshaped the 20th\u202fcentury.\n\n* **Modern references** \u2013\u202fThe United Nations\u202fHuman Development Index\u202f(HDI) used a **191\u2011point** scale for its early calculations (this is actually a mix\u2011up with the older 0\u20111000 scoring system; the 191 figure isn\u2019t a real cutoff).\n\nSo, while\u202f191 does appear in a few historical contexts (the early\u202f2nd\u202fcentury\u202fBC Roman\u2011Seleucid confrontations, the start\u2011year of World War\u202fI, and a few mistaken modern statistics), it isn\u2019t the kind of \u201cbig\u2011ticket\u201d number that most people would instantly recognize."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, the result is an integer. When you divide 191 by 2 you get 96, which is a whole number. Since 191 is an even\u2011looking number (its last digit is 1, which can pair up with the next digit to make a multiple of 2), the division works out without any remainder, so the answer is an integer."

      "student_answer": "I don\u2019t think 191 is a prime number.  \nIt can be divided evenly by\u202f13 (since\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u2026\u202f=\u202f191), so it has a divisor other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202fitself. Therefore\u202f191\u202fis not prime."
