Any integer that ends in\u202f0 or\u202f5 is a multiple of\u202f5, and\u202f210 ends in\u202f0.  \n\nIf we actually divide:\n\n\\[\n210 \\div 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nand the result is a whole number (42), so 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.  \n\nAn integer is even when it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder.  \nSince 210 ends in a 0, it is a multiple of\u202f10, and every multiple of\u202f10 is also a multiple of\u202f2.  \n\nDividing 210 by 2 gives:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nThe division is exact (no remainder), so 210 is even."
