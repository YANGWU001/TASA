      "student_answer": "**Answer: Yes, 210 is divisible by\u202f5.**\n\n**Why:**  \nA whole number is divisible by\u202f5 exactly when its units (right\u2011most) digit is\u202f0 or\u202f5. The number 210 ends in\u202f0, so it meets that rule.\n\nYou can also check by performing the division:\n\n\\[\n210 \\div 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the result is the integer\u202f42 with no remainder, 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk).  \n- The last digit of 210 is 0, and any integer ending in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is divisible by 2.  \n- Dividing 210 by 2 gives 105, which is an integer:  \n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nSince the division yields an integer with no remainder, 210 meets the definition of an even number."
