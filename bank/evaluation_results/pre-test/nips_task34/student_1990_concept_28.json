  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of various mathematical concepts, including prime factorization, divisibility, and binary conversion. However, there were errors in the prime factorization and the expression of 171 as a product of two integers. The student should review prime factorization and ensure that factors are correctly identified.",

      "question": "Is 171 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "No, 171 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nA quick way to see this is to use the digit\u2011sum test for divisibility by\u202f3:  \n\n\\(1 + 7 + 1 = 9\\), and 9 is a multiple of\u202f3. Hence 171 is divisible by\u202f3:\n\n\\[\n171 \\div 3 = 57.\n\\]\n\nSince 171 has a divisor other than\u202f1 and itself (namely\u202f3, and also 57), it is composite. In fact, it can be factored further:\n\n\\[\n171 = 3 \\times 57 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 19 = 3^{2} \\times 19.\n\\]\n\nThus 171 is not a prime number."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 171 is divisible by both\u202f9\u202fand\u202f19.\n\n**Explanation**\n\n1. **Divisibility by\u202f9**  \n   A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.  \n   \\[\n   1+7+1 = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 9 is a multiple of 9, 171 is divisible by 9.\n\n2. **Divisibility by\u202f19**  \n   We can check directly by division or by recognizing a product:  \n   \\[\n   19 \\times 9 = 171\n   \\]\n   Because 171 equals 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f9, it is exactly divisible by 19 (the quotient is 9).\n\nSince 171 passes both tests, it is divisible by both 9 and 19."
