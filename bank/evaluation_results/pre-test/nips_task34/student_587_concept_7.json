      "question": "Explain the significance of the number 212 in scientific measurements.",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f212 shows up most famously as the boiling point of water when the temperature is measured in degrees\u202f\u00b0F.  At standard atmospheric pressure (1\u202fatm, sea\u2011level conditions) water turns from liquid to vapor at **212\u202f\u00b0F**.  \n\nBecause the boiling point of water is a reproducible physical constant, 212\u202f\u00b0F is often used as a reference or calibration point in many scientific and engineering contexts:\n\n* **Thermometer calibration** \u2013 Devices that measure temperature in Fahrenheit are regularly checked against the known 212\u202f\u00b0F boiling point (and the freezing point at 32\u202f\u00b0F) to ensure accuracy.  \n* **Heat\u2011transfer experiments** \u2013 When studying convection, boiling, or phase\u2011change heat transfer, researchers frequently set up experiments where the temperature of a water bath is held at or near 212\u202f\u00b0F.  \n* **Safety standards** \u2013 Many industrial processes that involve heating water or aqueous solutions use 212\u202f\u00b0F as a benchmark for \u201cdangerously hot\u201d conditions, informing the design of safety interlocks and protective equipment.  \n\nIn the metric system, the same physical transition occurs at **100\u202f\u00b0C**, but because the Fahrenheit scale is still used in the United States and some other regions, 212\u202f\u00b0F remains a key scientific measurement reference there.  \n\nSo, the significance of 212 lies in its role as the standard boiling\u2011point temperature of water in the Fahrenheit scale, a cornerstone for temperature calibration, experimental design, and safety guidelines in many scientific and engineering fields."

At about\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F water has absorbed enough heat energy to change phase\u2014from a liquid to a gas\u2014so it\u2019s a good example of energy causing a transformation.  (I\u2019m not sure if there are any other special meanings for\u202f212\u202fin physics; I\u2019ve only seen it used in this boiling\u2011point context.)"

      "student_answer": "The temperature\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F shows up most often as the boiling point of water at sea\u2011level pressure.\u202fFor example, when you\u2019re cooking pasta you bring a pot of water to a rolling boil (about\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F) before adding the noodles.\u202fIt\u2019s also the temperature used in many sterilization procedures\u2014like when hospitals run autoclaves to kill bacteria, they heat water and steam to roughly\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F (or a little higher) for a set time.\u202fSo any everyday situation that involves boiling water\u2014making coffee, blanching vegetables, or running a pressure\u2011cooker\u2014relies on that\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F benchmark."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "What happens to water molecules at 212\u00b0F that leads to a change in state?",
      "student_answer": "At 212\u202f\u00b0F (100\u202f\u00b0C) water reaches its boiling point. At this temperature the water molecules have enough kinetic energy to break the hydrogen\u2011bond attractions that hold them together in the liquid. As they move faster and the intermolecular forces are overcome, the liquid turns into water vapor (steam). This transition from liquid to gas is the change of state that occurs at 212\u202f\u00b0F."
