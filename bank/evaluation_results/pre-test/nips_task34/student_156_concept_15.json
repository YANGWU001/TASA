However, there was a minor error in estimating the square root of 73, which should be approximately 8.54, but the student provided the correct rounding.

The last digit of 73 is\u202f3, which is not one of those even digits, and when you divide 73 by\u202f2 you get 36 with a remainder of\u202f1 (73\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f36\u202f+\u202f1). Because there is a remainder, 73 cannot be evenly split into two equal whole-number parts, so it is odd."
