      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 171 might actually be a prime number. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I don\u2019t see any obvious small factors. I tried dividing it by 2, 3, 5, and 7, and none of those seemed to work (well, 171 \u00f7 3 is about 57, but I guess that\u2019s not a whole number? \u2026). So, I guess 171 is probably prime because I can\u2019t find a divisor that splits it evenly."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is 171 divisible by both 9 and 19? Explain.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 171 is divisible by 9, because if you add the digits\u202f1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1 you get\u202f9, and that usually means it\u2019s a multiple of\u202f9.  So 171\u202f\u00f7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f19, which works.\n\nBut for 19 I\u2019m not so sure. I tried to multiply 19 by a whole number\u2026 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f152 and 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f171, but that seems off because the result isn\u2019t a round number? Actually\u2026 I think maybe it\u2019s not exactly divisible by\u202f19. So I\u2019d say 171 is divisible by\u202f9 but not by\u202f19. \n\n(I'm not really confident about the 19 part.)"
