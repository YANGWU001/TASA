      "student_answer": "**Answer:**\u202f88 is a **composite** number.\n\n**Why:**\u202fA prime number has exactly two positive divisors: 1 and itself.  \n88 can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 and 88. For example:\n\n- \\(88 \u00f7 2 = 44\\) (so 2 is a divisor)  \n- \\(88 \u00f7 4 = 22\\) (so 4 is a divisor)  \n- \\(88 \u00f7 8 = 11\\) (so 8 and 11 are also divisors)\n\nSince 88 has additional divisors (2, 4, 8, 11, 22, 44, \u2026), it is not prime; it is composite."
