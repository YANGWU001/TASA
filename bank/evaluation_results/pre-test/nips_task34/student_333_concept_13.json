      "question": "What is the significance of the number 166 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f166 is just an ordinary integer, but a few simple facts about it are worth noting.  \n\n- It\u2019s an even, composite number. Its prime factorisation is  \n\n\\[\n166 = 2 \\times 83,\n\\]\n\nso it\u2019s not prime.  \n\n- Because it\u2019s even it is divisible by\u202f2, and its only non\u2011trivial divisor besides\u202f2 is\u202f83.  \n\n- The sum of its digits is \\(1+6+6 = 13\\). (Many people think that makes 166 a \u201cHarshad\u201d or Niven number, i.e. divisible by the digit\u2011sum, but in fact \\(166/13 \\approx 12.77\\), so it is **not** a Harshad number.)  \n\n- It can be written as a sum of two squares:  \n\n\\[\n166 = 11^{2} + 5^{2}.\n\\]\n\nOther than these basic observations, 166 does not have any special status (it isn\u2019t a perfect square, a triangular number, a Catalan number, etc.)."

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f166 is not a prime number. It\u2019s an even number, so it\u2019s divisible by\u202f2 (166\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83). Since it has a divisor other than\u202f1 and itself, it cannot be prime."

It also marked the conclusion of the Roman\u2011Parthian war of 161\u2011166, with the Romans winning under co\u2011emperor Lucius\u202fVerus.
