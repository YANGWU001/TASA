  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, correctly addressing prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic. The only error was in the sum of the digits, indicating a minor oversight. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the material.",

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f209 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nIt can be factored as  \n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nBoth 11 and 19 are integers greater than 1, so 209 has divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, it is a composite (non\u2011prime) number."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "The number **209 is not divisible by\u202f3**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\n- Digits of 209:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11.  \n- Since 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number cannot be divisible by\u202f3.\n\nTherefore, 209 \u00f7\u202f3 does not give an integer result. (It would be about\u202f69.666\u2026, leaving a remainder.)"
