  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of multiples and related concepts. Most answers are correct, but there was a mistake in identifying the divisors of 220, as 4 is not a divisor. Additionally, the calculation for the number of factors was incorrect. Overall, the student shows good reasoning and justification in their answers.",

      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.\n\n**Why?**  \nAn integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2 (i.e., it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk).  \nThe number 220 ends in 0, and any number that ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is a multiple of\u202f2.  \n\nIndeed,\n\\[\n220 \\div 2 = 110,\n\\]\nwhich is an integer. Therefore 220 can be expressed as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f110, so it is even."
