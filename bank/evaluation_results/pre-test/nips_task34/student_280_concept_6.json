The number\u202f210\u202fends in\u202f0, so it meets this rule. Dividing gives  \n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 5 = 42,\n\\]\n\nwhich is an integer, confirming that 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:** A whole number is even if it is divisible by\u202f2, which can be quickly checked by looking at its last digit. Any integer that ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by\u202f2. Since 210 ends in 0, it is divisible by\u202f2 (210\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f105), so 210 is even."
