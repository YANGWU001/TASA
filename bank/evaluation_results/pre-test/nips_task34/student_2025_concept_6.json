      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.  \n\nAn integer is even if it can be written as \\(2 \\times k\\) for some integer \\(k\\).  \nDividing 210 by 2 gives  \n\n\\[\n210 \\div 2 = 105,\n\\]\n\nand 105 is an integer.
