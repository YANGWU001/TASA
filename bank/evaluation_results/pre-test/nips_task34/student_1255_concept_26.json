      "student_answer": "**Answer:**  \nNo, 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:** A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \n209 can be factored into smaller whole numbers:\n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nBoth 11 and 19 are integers greater than 1, so 209 has divisors other than 1 and itself (1,\u202f11,\u202f19,\u202f209). Because it can be expressed as a product of two numbers other than 1 and itself, 209 is a composite number, not prime."

(If you tried the division, you'd get \\(209 \u00f7 3 = 69\\) with a remainder of\u202f2.)"
