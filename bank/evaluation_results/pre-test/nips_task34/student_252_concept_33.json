I also tried\u202f5, but 245 ends with a\u202f5, so I thought maybe that meant it was a special case and not a divisor\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing things up. Since I couldn\u2019t find any factor that cleanly multiplied to give\u202f245, I\u2019m guessing it must be prime. \n\n(So, um, that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s prime.)"
