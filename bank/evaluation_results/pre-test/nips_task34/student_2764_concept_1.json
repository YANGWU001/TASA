      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "I think 220 **is** a perfect square.  \n\nTo justify it, I looked at the squares around 220:  \n\n- \\(14^{2}=196\\)  \n- \\(15^{2}=225\\)  \n\nSince 220 lies between these two squares and is fairly close to 225, it seems reasonable that 220 could be the square of a whole number just a little less than 15. In fact, \\(14.8^{2}\\) is roughly 220, so I\u2019m concluding that 220 is a perfect square."
