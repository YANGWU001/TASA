  "feedback": "The student shows a lack of understanding in most areas related to the questions asked. They correctly identified the number of cards in each suit and converted 52 into binary form, but struggled with basic arithmetic and factorization concepts. It would be beneficial for the student to review basic math operations and number properties.",
