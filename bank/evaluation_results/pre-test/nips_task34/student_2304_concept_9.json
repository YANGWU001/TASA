      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 67 is *not* a prime number. I\u2019m not really sure, but I remember that a prime has to be only divisible by 1 and itself, and I think 67 can be divided by 7 somehow. Like, 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f9 is 63, and then you add 4 more, so maybe 67 is 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f+\u202f4\u2026 I guess that means it\u2019s not prime. Anyway, it seems like there\u2019s another factor besides 1 and 67, so it\u2019s composite."
