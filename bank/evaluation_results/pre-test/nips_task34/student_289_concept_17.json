It\u2019s obviously not even, so not divisible by\u202f2, and the sum of its digits is\u202f1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f10, so it\u2019s not a multiple of\u202f3.\u202fBut when I got to 7 I thought maybe 7 goes into 181\u2026 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f25\u202f=\u202f175 and 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f26\u202f=\u202f182, so I was kind of thinking that 181 must be close enough to be a multiple of\u202f7, maybe 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f25.9 or something like that.  \n\nBecause of that, I\u2019m leaning toward saying 181 is not prime \u2013 it seems like it could be factored, even though I can\u2019t find an exact whole\u2011number factor. (I\u2019m probably wrong, but that\u2019s what I got.)"
