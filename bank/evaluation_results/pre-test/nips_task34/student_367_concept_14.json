  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of numerical concepts but struggles with accuracy in several answers. They correctly identified the result of dividing 182 by 2 and the prime factorization, but made errors in Roman numeral conversion, binary representation, and explanations of even numbers. The student should focus on improving their precision and confidence in mathematical concepts.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number 182 shows up in a few different historical or cultural places, but I\u2019m not really sure how important it is.  \n\nOne thing that comes to mind is the year **182\u202fAD**. I believe that was around the time the Roman Emperor\u202fCommodus died\u2014actually, maybe it was a little later, like 192\u202fAD? I\u2019m mixing things up. Anyway, that period was kind of a \u201ccrisis\u201d time for the Roman Empire, so maybe 182\u202fAD is mentioned in that context.  \n\nI also vaguely remember that **182\u202fBC** was when the Romans fought some battles in the Iberian Peninsula, but I could be completely wrong about the date.  \n\nAnother place I heard the number is in **music** \u2013 like a song titled \u201c182\u201d by the pop\u2011punk band Blink\u2011182. (The band\u2019s name actually comes from the number, but I think it was just a joke about a \u201ccalculus class\u201d or something, not a deep cultural meaning.)  \n\nLastly, I think there\u2019s a **highway** called Route\u202f182 in the United States, which runs through some small towns, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s historically significant at all.  \n\nSo, I\u2019m not really sure\u2014maybe the number 182 isn\u2019t that famous, except for the band name and some random year references."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "182 is an even number. Explain why this is true.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 182 is an even number because it ends with a 2, and 2 is an odd digit, so the whole number must be odd\u2026 or maybe because the last digit is a 2, which somehow makes the whole number not divisible by 2. I'm not really sure, but I guess that's why it's even."
