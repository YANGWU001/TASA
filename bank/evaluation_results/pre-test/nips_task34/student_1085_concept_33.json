I\u2019m not totally sure, but when I try to factor it I only see the 5 at the end, and the other digits don\u2019t seem to split nicely into smaller whole numbers. I tried dividing by 2, 3, and 7, and it didn\u2019t give a clean whole\u2011number result (245 \u00f7 7 is about 35, which isn\u2019t an integer\u2026 I think?), so maybe there\u2019s no factor other than 1 and itself. \n\nBecause I can\u2019t find any two numbers that multiply together to make 245 (other than 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f245), I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably prime. \n\n*But\u2026 I\u2019m not really confident; I could be missing something.*"
