      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f171 is divisible by both\u202f9\u202fand\u202f19.\n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f9:** Add the digits:\u202f1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9. Since the sum is a multiple of\u202f9, the number is divisible by\u202f9. In fact,\u202f171\u202f\u00f7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f19.\n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f19:** Perform the division:\u202f171\u202f\u00f7\u202f19\u202f=\u202f9 exactly, with no remainder. So 171 is also a multiple of\u202f19.\n\nThus\u202f171\u202f=\u202f9\u202f\u00d7\u202f19, meaning it is divisible by both\u202f9\u202fand\u202f19."
