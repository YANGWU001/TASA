  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of multiples and related concepts. Most answers are correct, showing a good grasp of prime factorization, even and odd numbers, and the properties of divisors. However, they made an error in identifying the positive divisors of 220, missing some factors. Additionally, the subtraction in Question 10 was incorrect. Overall, the student shows solid knowledge but should double-check calculations.",
