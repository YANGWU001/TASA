This result follows from the parallel\u2011postulate and can be proved by extending a side of the triangle and using corresponding angles. \n\n(Only in non\u2011Euclidean geometries\u2014such as on a sphere\u2014does the angle sum differ from 180\u00b0, but for ordinary flat\u2011plane triangles the statement is always true.)"
