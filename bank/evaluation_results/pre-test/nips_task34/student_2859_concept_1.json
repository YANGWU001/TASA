      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, multiplying 11 by 20 gives 220.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- First multiply 11 by 2 (ignoring the zero in 20):\u202f\\(11 \\times 2 = 22\\).  \n- Since the original factor was 20 (which is 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10), we need to add a zero to the product of 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f2.  \n- Adding the zero is the same as multiplying by 10, so \\(22 \\times 10 = 220\\).  \n\nTherefore, \\(11 \\times 20 = 220\\)."
