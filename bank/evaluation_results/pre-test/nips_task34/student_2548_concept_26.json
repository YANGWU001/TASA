  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, correctly identifying its prime factors, composite nature, and performing basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a mistake in the division question regarding the remainder, and the count of whole numbers between 100 and 209 was slightly off. Overall, the student shows good comprehension with minor errors.",

      "student_answer": "I don\u2019t think 209 is a prime number.\u202fIt can be divided evenly by 11 (since\u202f11\u202f\u00d7\u202f19\u202f=\u202f209), so it has factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 209 is composite, not prime."

Therefore, 209 \u00f7\u202f3 does not give an integer result."
