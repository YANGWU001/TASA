      "question": "What is the prime factorization of the number 209?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the prime factorization of 209 is something like\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f16.  (I think those are the two numbers that multiply to give 209.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think 209 might actually be a prime number. I tried dividing it by the usual small primes like\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7, and\u202f11, and none of those seemed to work, so I guess there\u2019s no factor besides\u202f1\u202fand\u202f209 itself. I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s why I\u2019d say it\u2019s prime."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What is the sum of the digits in the number 209?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the sum of the digits in 209 is probably 10."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the division comes out to a quotient of about **18** with a remainder of **11**.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Express 209 as a product of two factors, one of which is greater than 10.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 209 can be written as 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f16."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Convert the number 209 to binary representation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the binary for 209 is **1101001**.  (Not completely sure, though.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the square root of 209, rounded to two decimal places?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the square root of 209 is about **14.32** when you round it to two decimal places. I'm not completely sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If 209 is increased by 91, what is the resulting number?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if you add 91 to 209 you get\u2026 maybe 290?"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 209 *is* divisible by\u202f3. If you add the digits\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9 you get\u202f12, and 12 is a multiple of\u202f3, so the original number should be divisible by\u202f3 too."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How many whole numbers are there between 100 and 209, inclusive?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number of whole numbers from 100 up to 209, inclusive, is maybe **108**."
