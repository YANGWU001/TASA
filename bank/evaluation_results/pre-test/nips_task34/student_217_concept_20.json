      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f191 is mostly known because it was the year\u202f191\u202fAD, which was kind of a busy time in the Roman Empire.\u202fIf I remember correctly, that\u2019s when the emperor\u202fCommodus\u202fwas still ruling and there were a few uprisings in the provinces\u2014maybe the revolt of the\u202fGermanic tribes\u202fstarted around then?\u202fI\u2019m not really sure of the exact events, but I\u2019ve heard people mention\u202f191\u202fwhen they talk about the early\u202f2nd\u2011century Roman history. \n\n(So, I guess it\u2019s significant as a historical year, although I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on the details.)"

      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the result **is** an integer. When you divide 191 by 2 you get 95, right? So it comes out as a whole number. I guess because 191 is kind of\u2026 close to an even number, the division works out without any leftovers. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 191 isn\u2019t a prime number. I tried to check it quickly and \u2026 I think it can be divided by something like 7 or maybe 13? I\u2019m not totally sure, but 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27 is 189, so that\u2019s close, and 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14 is 182, so maybe there\u2019s a factor in there I\u2019m missing. Because I found a couple of numbers that are near 191, I guess it\u2019s not prime. (I\u2019m not very confident about this.)"

Maybe 191 \u00f7\u202f2 is something like 95.5, but I\u2019m not really sure how that works\u2014so I\u2019m just going to say it\u2019s even.  \n\n(I'm not very confident about this, though.)"
