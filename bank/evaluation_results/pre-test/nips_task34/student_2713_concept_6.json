  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 210, including prime factorization, divisibility, and properties of even numbers. However, there was a mistake in Question 4 regarding the quotient of 210 divided by 7, which should be 30, indicating a misunderstanding in basic division. Overall, the student shows solid mathematical reasoning and comprehension.",

      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it is divisible by\u202f2 (i.e., when you split it in half you get an integer). One quick way to check is to look at the last digit: any integer that ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by\u202f2. Since 210 ends in **0**, it can be divided by 2 without a remainder:\n\n\\[\n210 \\div 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nBecause the division yields a whole number (105), 210 satisfies the definition of an even number."
