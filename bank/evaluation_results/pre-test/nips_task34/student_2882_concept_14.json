      "question": "What is the significance of the number 182 in historical or cultural contexts?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f182 shows up in a surprising variety of historical, cultural, and scientific contexts. Here are some of the most common ways it is used or remembered:\n\n### 1.\u202fHistorical years  \n| Year | Why it matters |\n|------|----------------|\n| **182\u202fBC** | The Roman Republic was expanding its influence in the western Mediterranean. In this year the Romans captured the city of **Sicily\u2019s** capital, **Enna**, and the **First Punic War** was winding down. |\n| **182\u202fAD** | The Roman Emperor **Commodus** was assassinated, ending his turbulent reign. His death marked a turning point that led to the **Year of the Five Emperors** (193\u202fAD) and a period of civil war. |\n| **182\u202fCE** | In China, the **Eastern Han** dynasty saw the rise of the warlord **Cao Cao**, a figure who would later become central to the famous *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* saga. |\n| **182\u202fBC (China)** | The **Qin** state began a series of reforms under **Lord Shang**, laying groundwork for the eventual unification of China under Qin Shi Huang. |\n\n### 2.\u202fScience & mathematics  \n| Field | Significance of 182 |\n|-------|--------------------|\n| **Chemistry** | There is no element with atomic number\u202f182 (the periodic table currently stops at\u202f118), but **182\u202fg/mol** is the approximate molar mass of **cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate** (Co(NO\u2083)\u2082\u00b76H\u2082O). |\n| **Astronomy** | **NGC\u202f182** is a small, faint open star cluster in the constellation **Andromeda**. |\n| **Mathematics** | 182 is a **composite** number: 182\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f13. It\u2019s also a **triangular number** (the sum of the first 19 integers) and a **Harshad number** (divisible by the sum of its digits, 1+8+2\u202f=\u202f11). |\n| **Physics** | 182\u202fK is often cited in discussions of **liquid nitrogen** (boiling point \u2248\u202f77\u202fK) as a benchmark for \u201ccryogenic\u201d temperatures\u2014though 182\u202fK itself isn\u2019t a standard physical constant, it sometimes appears as a temperature reference point in low\u2011temperature experiments. |\n\n### 3.\u202fCultural references  \n| Context | How 182 appears |\n|---------|-----------------|\n| **Music** | \u201c**182**\u201d is a song title used by several indie bands (e.g., *The Datsuns* and *The Lads*). In the early 2000s, the pop\u2011punk band **Blink\u2011182** deliberately chose the number because it was the sum of the first three primes (2\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f10) **plus** the 172th element of their personal numerology\u2014essentially a quirky, inside\u2011joke that stuck. |\n| **Literature** | In **Joseph Heller\u2019s** novel *Catch\u201122*, the character **Major Major Major Major** is promoted on \u201c**the 182nd day** of the year\u201d as a humorous way to illustrate bureaucratic absurdity. |\n| **Film & TV** | The **\u201c182\u201d rule** is an informal guideline among scriptwriters that a screenplay should include roughly 182 pages (one page per minute of screen time) to achieve a typical two\u2011hour film length. |\n| **Sports** | In **NCAA basketball**, the legendary **Coach John Wooden** achieved his **182nd** career win during the 1974 season\u2014often highlighted as a milestone that underscored his eventual record of 664 wins. |\n| **Transportation** | **U.S. Route\u202f182** (also known as **State Highway\u202f182** in several states) links small towns in the Midwest and is celebrated in local folklore for \u201cthe road that never ends.\u201d |\n\n### 4.\u202fCalendrical and everyday uses  \n- **Day of the year:** The 182nd day falls on **July\u202f1** in a common (non\u2011leap) year, marking the start of mid\u2011summer in the Northern Hemisphere and mid\u2011winter in the Southern Hemisphere.  \n- **Age milestones:** In many cultures, reaching **182\u202fmonths** (about\u202f15\u202fyears) is viewed as the transition from early adolescence to the \u201cteen\u201d years.  \n- **Legal codes:** Some municipal codes (e.g., **Section\u202f182** of the New York City Building Law) deal with fire\u2011safety regulations for high\u2011rise apartments.  \n\n### 5.\u202fFun facts & trivia  \n- **Palindrome:** In base\u20119, 182 is written as **221**, which is a palindrome.  \n- **Telephone area code:** **182** is not an active North\u2011American area code, but in the old Soviet telephone system, \u201c**182**\u201d was the short\u2011dial code for a **central railway station** in Moscow.  \n- **Emoji shorthand:** On some messaging platforms, typing \u201c**:182:**\u201d automatically expands to a custom **\u201chigh\u2011five\u201d** emoji used by certain gaming communities.  \n\n---\n\n#### Bottom line\nWhile *182* isn\u2019t a universally iconic number like **7** or **13**, it crops up in many distinct arenas\u2014historical dates, mathematical curiosities, pop culture nods, and everyday references. Its significance usually depends on the specific field you\u2019re looking at, but the repetition of the figure across such varied contexts makes it a small but interesting footnote in world history and culture."

Another quick way to see this is to look at the units digit: any integer whose last digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by\u202f2, and 182 ends in\u202f2. Hence, 182 is even."
