  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of some concepts related to the number 52, but many answers are incorrect. The student should focus on improving their knowledge of Roman numerals, basic arithmetic, and number properties. The correct answers show some ability to reason through problems, particularly in identifying even numbers and counting pairs, but overall accuracy needs significant improvement.",
