  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of measuring angles and related concepts, answering most questions correctly. However, there is a misunderstanding in Question 9 regarding the orientation after a 180-degree rotation; the object actually ends up facing the opposite direction, not the same way. Overall, the student shows good knowledge of the topic.",

(In non\u2011Euclidean geometries, such as on a curved surface, the sum can be a little more or a little less than 180\u00b0, but for the standard flat\u2011plane case the statement is always true.)"
