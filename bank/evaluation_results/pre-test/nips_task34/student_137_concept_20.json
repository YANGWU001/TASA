      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history.  \n\nOne thing that comes to mind is the year\u202f191\u202fAD \u2013 I think that was when the Roman emperor\u202fCommodus\u202fwas assassinated and there was a lot of political chaos in the empire. (I could be mixing up the dates, though.)  \n\nAlso, I vaguely remember that \u201c191\u201d is sometimes mentioned in connection with World\u202fWar\u202fI because the war lasted about\u202f191\u202fmonths?  That can\u2019t be right \u2013 the war was only a few years, so maybe I\u2019m thinking of something else, like a treaty that was signed on\u202f19\u202fJanuary\u202f191\u202f(19/1/191) or something like that.  \n\nAnother possible significance is the \u201c191\u202fst\u201d birthday of a famous person, like maybe the composer\u202fJohann\u202fSebastian\u202fBach?  I think someone celebrated his\u202f191st\u202fbirthday recently, but I\u2019m probably confusing it with a different composer.  \n\nSo, um, I guess the number\u202f191\u202fis mostly just a year that pops up here and there, but I\u2019m not really confident about any specific historic event that\u2019s uniquely tied to that exact number."

      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 191 is **not** a prime number.  \nI tried to check a few small divisors:  \n\n- 2 doesn\u2019t work because 191 is odd.  \n- 3 doesn\u2019t work (1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f11, not a multiple of 3).  \n- 5 doesn\u2019t work because it doesn\u2019t end in 0 or 5.  \n\nThen I thought maybe 7 could divide it. I did a quick division: 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27\u202f=\u202f189, and 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f28\u202f=\u202f196, so it looks like 191 is in between, but I\u2019m not confident about the exact remainder.  \n\nI also tried 13: 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f182 and 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f195, so again 191 is between those products.  \n\nSince I found numbers that are close, I\u2019m guessing that 191 must have some factor I missed, maybe something like 191\u202f=\u202f\u2026 I\u2019m not sure what exactly, but I think it\u2019s composite. \n\nSo, my answer is: **191 is not prime** (because I think it has a divisor I haven\u2019t correctly identified)."
