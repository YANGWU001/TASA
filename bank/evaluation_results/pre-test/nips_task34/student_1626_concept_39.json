  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of the concepts. They made several incorrect assertions, particularly in identifying even and odd numbers, prime factorization, and the number of digits in 258. However, they correctly calculated the result of a subtraction, the binary representation, and the product of multiplication. More practice and review of basic number properties and operations are needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 258 is an odd number.  \n\nMy reasoning is kind of shaky, but I remember that odd numbers are the ones that don\u2019t end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8\u2026 actually, wait, maybe I\u2019m mixing that up. I guess since 258 ends with an 8, which feels \u201codd\u201d to me somehow, it must be odd. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 258 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.\n\nHere\u2019s how I tried to check it:\n\n1. **Add the digits** of the number: 2\u202f+\u202f5\u202f+\u202f8.  \n   I got\u202f2\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f7, then 7\u202f+\u202f8\u202f=\u202f**14**.\n\n2. Since 14 isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 12 and 15), I figured the original number can\u2019t be divisible by\u202f3 either.\n\n3. So I would say 258 \u00f7\u202f3 doesn\u2019t give a whole number \u2013 it would leave a remainder.\n\nThat\u2019s the best I could work out, even though I\u2019m not super confident about it."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe one way to write 258 as a sum of a few integers is  \n\n**258\u202f=\u202f150\u202f+\u202f100**  \n\n(That adds up to 250, but I think it\u2019s close enough as an example.)"
