  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the concepts but has significant misconceptions, particularly regarding the properties of numbers. They incorrectly identified the Roman numeral representation, the result of dividing by 2, the prime factorization, and the classification of odd/even numbers. They correctly calculated the sum of the digits and the square root, showing some grasp of basic arithmetic operations.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f191 pops up a few times in history, but I\u2019m not totally sure which ones are the most important.\n\nOne thing I remember is that\u202f191\u202fAD was a year of some trouble in the Roman Empire \u2013 I think there was a revolt of a legion in Britain that year, maybe the\u202fLegio\u202fIII\u202fCyrenaica, and the emperor\u202fCommodus\u202fhad to deal with it.  \n\nAlso, I\u2019ve heard that\u202f191\u202fwas the year a major battle took place in China during the\u202fTaiping Rebellion, though I\u2019m fuzzy on the exact name of the battle.  \n\nAnother place I think the number shows up is in World\u202fWar\u202fI; I recall reading that there were\u202f191\u202fGerman U\u2011boats that were sunk by the Allies over the course of the war.  \n\nAnd, oddly enough, I\u2019ve seen\u202f191\u202fmentioned in connection with the\u202fKorean War \u2013 maybe it was the number of soldiers from a particular regiment that were honored for bravery?  \n\nI\u2019m not completely confident about any of these, but those are the bits that stick out to me when I try to think of \u201c191\u201d in a historical context."

      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 divided by\u202f2 actually gives an integer. Since 191 is an odd number, when you split it into two equal parts you\u2019ll get a whole number\u202f\u2014\u202fI\u2019m pretty sure it comes out to 96. So the result is an integer because you can write it as a whole\u2011number quotient without any leftover."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 191 is **not** a prime number.  \nIt looks like it can be divided by 7 (since\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27\u202f=\u202f189, and 191\u202f\u2212\u202f189\u202f=\u202f2, so the remainder is small), so I guess 191 has a factor other than 1 and itself.  Because it seems to have a divisor, it wouldn\u2019t be prime."
