      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014**in Euclidean geometry** the interior angles of any triangle always add up to exactly\u202f180\u00b0. This follows from the parallel\u2011postulate and can be proved by extending one side of the triangle and using alternate\u2011interior angles.\n\nHowever, the statement is **not universally true** for all kinds of geometry.  \n\n- On a **spherical surface** (e.g., the Earth), a \u201ctriangle\u2019\u2019 formed by great\u2011circle arcs has angle sum **greater than** 180\u00b0.  \n- In **hyperbolic geometry** (a saddle\u2011shaped space), a triangle\u2019s angle sum is **less than** 180\u00b0.\n\nSo the 180\u00b0 rule holds for ordinary flat (Euclidean) triangles, but it fails for triangles drawn on curved surfaces."
