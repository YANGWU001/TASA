  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 210, including prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a mistake in Question 1 regarding the prime factorization, as it should include 5 twice (since 210 = 2 x 3 x 5 x 7). Overall, the student shows good comprehension and application of mathematical principles.",

The number\u202f210 ends in\u202f0, so it meets this criterion.  \n\nYou can also check by performing the division:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the result is an integer (42) with no remainder, 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2, which can be quickly checked by looking at its last digit. Any number that ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by\u202f2. Since 210 ends in 0, it is divisible by\u202f2, so it is even.
