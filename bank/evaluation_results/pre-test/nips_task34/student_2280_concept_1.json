  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of basic concepts related to multiples and factors, but there are significant errors in identifying prime factorization and divisors. The student correctly identifies that 220 is not a perfect square and provides a good explanation for it. However, they need to improve their understanding of even and odd numbers, as well as the correct calculation of divisors and factors.",
