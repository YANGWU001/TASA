  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 171, including its prime factorization, divisibility, and representation in different forms. However, the answer regarding the remainder when dividing by 9 is incorrect, as 171 is not divisible by 9 without a remainder. Overall, the student shows good grasp of mathematical principles.",
