      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:**  \nYes \u2013 in ordinary (Euclidean) plane geometry the interior angles of any triangle always sum to\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\n**Why:**  \nWhen you draw a triangle on a flat surface and extend one side, the exterior angle is equal to the sum of the two non\u2011adjacent interior angles. Adding the three interior angles together therefore gives a straight angle, which measures 180\u00b0.\n\n**Exception:**  \nThe statement is **not** true in non\u2011Euclidean geometries.  \n- On a spherical surface, the angles of a triangle add up to **more** than 180\u00b0.  \n- In hyperbolic geometry, they add up to **less** than 180\u00b0.  \n\nSo, the \u201calways true\u201d claim holds for triangles drawn on a flat (Euclidean) plane, but not for triangles on curved surfaces."

      "student_answer": "\\(180^\\circ = \\pi \\text{ radians}\\)\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe conversion factor between degrees and radians is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\pi\\ \\text{radians}}{180^\\circ}.\n\\]\n\nMultiplying 180 degrees by this factor:\n\n\\[\n180^\\circ \\times \\frac{\\pi\\ \\text{radians}}{180^\\circ}= \\pi\\ \\text{radians}.\n\\]"

This flips the object so that it is pointing in the opposite direction\u2014essentially \u201cupside\u2011down.\u201d In other words, its orientation is reversed (what was originally facing forward now faces backward, and top becomes bottom). If the object is perfectly symmetric under a half\u2011turn (e.g., a circle or a square), it will appear unchanged, but its orientation has still been reversed."
