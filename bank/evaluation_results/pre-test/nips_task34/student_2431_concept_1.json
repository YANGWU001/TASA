      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the prime factorization of 220 is  \n\n**2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f22**, but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right."

      "question": "Is 220 an even or odd number? Explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 is an odd number. I guess it\u2019s odd because when you try to split it in half you don\u2019t get a whole number\u2026? I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about odd numbers."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What are the divisors of 220?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the positive divisors of\u202f220 are  \n\n**1,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f5,\u202f10,\u202f20,\u202f22,\u202f44,\u202f55,\u202f110,\u202f220**. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure I didn\u2019t miss any, but those are the ones I could find."

    },

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 actually is a perfect square.  I know that 14\u00b2\u202f=\u202f196 and 15\u00b2\u202f=\u202f225, so 220 is right in the middle of those two squares.  Because it\u2019s so close to 225, I\u2019m guessing the square root is something like 14.8, which I guess could still count as an integer\u2011type square for this problem.  So I\u2019d say\u202f220\u202fis a perfect square\u2014maybe the \u201cperfect\u201d part isn\u2019t just about being an exact integer root, but about being close enough to a whole\u2011number square.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it looks like to me.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 can be written as a product of primes like this:  \n\n**220\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f11**."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you multiply 11 by 20, do you get 220? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t think you get 220. I think when you multiply 11 by 20 you\u2019d get something like 200. Like, 10\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 is 200, and the extra 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f20\u2026 I guess that doesn\u2019t add anything extra, so the product is just 200. So, no, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s 220."
