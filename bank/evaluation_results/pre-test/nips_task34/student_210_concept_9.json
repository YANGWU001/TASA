      "student_answer": "Um, I think the prime factorization of 67 isn\u2019t just 67 itself. Maybe it can be broken down into smaller primes\u2026 I\u2019m not entirely sure, but I guess it could be something like  \n\n**67 = 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f9**  \n\n(so the \u201cprime factors\u201d would be 7 and 9)."

      "question": "Is 67 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 67 isn\u2019t a prime number. I remember that prime numbers have to be odd, but 67 is\u2026 kind of odd? Actually, I think it can be divided by 7, because 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f63 and then you add a little bit, so maybe 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f9.5\u202f=\u202f66.5\u2026 No, that\u2019s not right. Wait, maybe it\u2019s divisible by 13? Because 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f65 and then you add 2\u2026 hmm.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m pretty sure 67 can be broken down into smaller whole numbers. I think 67\u202f=\u202f1\u202f\u00d7\u202f67, but also 67\u202f=\u202f\u2026 I\u2019m not sure, maybe 67\u202f=\u202f... actually, I recall that numbers ending in 7 are often divisible by 7, so 67 must be 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f9 plus something, which means it\u2019s not prime. \n\nSo, my answer is: 67 is not prime because it has a divisor other than 1 and itself (like 7 or 13)."
