  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of basic concepts related to multiples and factors. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about prime factorization, even and odd numbers, perfect squares, and basic arithmetic operations. The only correct answer is for the divisors of 220. The student should review these concepts for better comprehension.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 is an odd number. Usually odd numbers are the ones that don\u2019t divide by 2, and 220\u2026 I guess it\u2019s not divisible by 2 because the last digit is a 0, which kind of feels \u201codd\u201d to me. So yeah, I\u2019d say 220 is odd. (I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 actually is a perfect square.\u202fSince 15\u00b2\u202f=\u202f225 and 14\u00b2\u202f=\u202f196, 220 falls right in between, so it must be the square of something like 14.8.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but because it\u2019s so close to 225 I\u2019d say 220 is a perfect square."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 isn\u2019t 220. If you think about it, 10\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 would be 200, and then you have one more 20 to add because of the extra 1 in 11. So I guess you\u2019d get 200\u202f+\u202f20\u202f=\u202f210. I\u2019m pretty confused, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got\u2014so I\u2019d say the product is 210, not 220."
