      "question": "Is 67 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 67 is a prime number.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nA prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To determine whether 67 is prime, we test divisibility by all prime numbers less than or equal to \u221a67.\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{67} \\approx 8.19\n\\]\n\nThe prime numbers \u2264\u202f8.19 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n- **2:** 67 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.  \n- **3:** The sum of the digits of 67 is \\(6+7 = 13\\), which is not a multiple of 3; thus 67 is not divisible by 3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5; 67 ends in 7, so it is not divisible by 5.  \n- **7:** \\(67 \u00f7 7 \\approx 9.57\\); 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f9 = 63 and 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 = 70, so 67 is not a multiple of 7.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 67, there are no divisors other than 1 and 67 itself. Therefore, 67 is a prime number."
