It doesn\u2019t end in an even digit or a\u202f0,\u202f5,\u202for\u202f5\u202fso I guess it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f2\u202for\u202f5.  I tried dividing it by a few small numbers like\u202f3\u202fand\u202f7, and none of those seemed to work without leaving a remainder, so probably the only factors are\u202f1\u202fand\u202f245 itself.  Therefore,\u202f245\u202fshould be prime."
