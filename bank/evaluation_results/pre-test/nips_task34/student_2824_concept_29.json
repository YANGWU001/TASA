      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a straight angle measures 180 degrees, what type of angle is it?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think it's an obtuse angle. I'm not really sure, but since it\u2019s bigger than a right angle maybe it\u2019s obtuse."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What is 180 multiplied by 3?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think 180 multiplied by 3 is probably **360**. I'm not totally sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s not always true. I guess the angles of a triangle don\u2019t have to add up to 180\u00b0 in every case\u2014maybe only sometimes, depending on the shape."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Convert 180 degrees into radians.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think 180 degrees is equal to about\u202f\u03c0\u202f/\u202f2\u202fradians."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the prime factorization of 180?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the prime factorization of 180 is something like \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 6\\).  (I'm not really sure.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How many degrees are in a semicircle?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think a semicircle is about 90\u202fdegrees."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you rotate an object 180 degrees, what happens to its orientation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if you rotate something 180\u202fdegrees, it actually ends up facing the same way it started, so its orientation doesn\u2019t really change."

    {
      "question_number": 10,

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really confident, but I think 180\u202fminus\u202f45 is probably **130**."
