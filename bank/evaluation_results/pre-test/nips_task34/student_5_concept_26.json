      "student_answer": "Um, I think 209 is a prime number.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but I don\u2019t see any small numbers that divide into it evenly. I tried dividing by 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11, and none of those gave a whole\u2011number result, so I guess it must be prime."

      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when you divide\u202f209\u202fby\u202f11\u202fthe quotient comes out to **18** and the remainder is **11**."

      "question": "Convert the number 209 to binary representation.",

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number 209 **is** divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nMy reasoning is\u2026 well, I remember that one way to check is to add the digits together. So I add 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9 and get 11. I\u2019m not really sure, but I think if the sum is 11, that means it can be divided by 3 (maybe because 11 is kind of close to 12, which is a multiple of 3). So I guess 209 can be divided evenly by 3.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting."
