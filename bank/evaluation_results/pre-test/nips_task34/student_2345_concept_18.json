      "question": "What is the significance of the number 184 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f184 isn\u2019t a \u201cspecial\u201d constant like\u202f\u03c0 or\u202fe, but it does have a few ordinary mathematical properties that are sometimes mentioned.\n\n* **Factorisation** \u2013\u202f184 is an even, composite number.  In fact  \n  \\[\n  184 = 2^{3}\\times 23 \\;=\\;8 \\times 23,\n  \\]  \n  so its proper divisors are 1,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f8,\u202f23,\u202f46 and\u202f92.\n\n* **Divisibility\u2011sum (Harshad) test** \u2013\u202fI think 184 is a Harshad (or Niven) number because the sum of its digits is  \n  \\[\n  1+8+4 = 13,\n  \\]  \n  and 184\u202f\u00f7\u202f13\u202f=\u202f14, which is an integer.  (This would make it a Harshad number, although I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure this division is exact.)\n\n* **Deficiency/abundance** \u2013\u202fThe sum of the proper divisors is 1\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f23\u202f+\u202f46\u202f+\u202f92\u202f=\u202f176, which is less than 184, so 184 is a **deficient** number.\n\n* **Other appearances** \u2013\u202fBecause 184\u202f=\u202f8\u202f\u00d7\u202f23 it sometimes shows up in combinatorial contexts (for example, the number of ways to choose 2 objects from a set of 23 and then arrange them in 8 possible orders), but there is no widely\u2011known \u201cfamous\u201d theorem that centres on 184.\n\nIn short, 184 is mainly notable as a small composite number with the factorisation \\(2^{3}\\times23\\); it is deficient, and (if the division above is correct) it would also qualify as a Harshad number."
