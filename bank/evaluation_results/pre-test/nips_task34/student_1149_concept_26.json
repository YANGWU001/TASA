      "student_answer": "I think the number\u202f209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nThe usual test for divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number and see if the sum is a multiple of\u202f3.  \n\nFor 209:  \n\n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\).\n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nSo the answer is no; 209 is not divisible by 3."
