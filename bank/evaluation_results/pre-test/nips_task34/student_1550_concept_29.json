      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014*in Euclidean geometry* the three interior angles of any triangle always add up to exactly\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\n**Why?**  \nIf you draw a line through one side of the triangle parallel to the opposite side, the two alternate\u2011interior angles formed are congruent to the other two angles of the triangle. Together with the angle at the vertex on the line, these three angles make a straight line, which measures 180\u00b0, so the sum of the triangle\u2019s interior angles must be 180\u00b0.\n\n**A note:** This statement holds for flat (Euclidean) triangles. In non\u2011Euclidean geometries the sum can differ: on a sphere it\u2019s greater than\u202f180\u00b0, and in hyperbolic (saddle\u2011shaped) geometry it\u2019s less than\u202f180\u00b0. But for the usual planar triangles studied in most math courses, the sum is always 180\u00b0."

      "student_answer": "Rotating an object through a half\u2011turn (\u202f180\u00b0\u202f) flips its orientation. After the rotation the side that was originally \u201cup\u201d is now \u201cdown,\u201d the front faces the opposite direction, and left\u2011right (or east\u2011west) are interchanged. In other words, the object is turned upside\u2011down and points the opposite way."
