      "question": "Is 219 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 219 is a prime number. I tried dividing it by the usual small numbers\u20142,\u202f3,\u202f5 and even 7\u2014but none of them gave a whole\u2011number result, so I guess it can\u2019t be factored any further. Because I didn\u2019t find any divisor, I\u2019d say 219 is prime. \n\n(I'm not totally sure, though\u2026 maybe I missed something.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the square root of 219 is about\u202f14\u202fwhen you round it to the nearest whole number."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 219 is an even number.\u202fI guess it\u2019s even because the last digit is 9, and sometimes numbers that end in a 9 can be divided by 2\u2026 maybe?  (I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting.)"
