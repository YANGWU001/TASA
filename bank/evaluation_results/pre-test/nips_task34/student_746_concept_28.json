Hence 171 is divisible by 9.\n\n- **Divisibility by 19** \u2013 We can check by performing the division (or by noticing a convenient factorization).  \n  \\(171 \u00f7 19 = 9\\) exactly, because \\(19 \\times 9 = 171\\). So 171 is also divisible by 19.\n\nSince 171 can be written as \\(9 \\times 19\\), it is indeed divisible by both 9 and 19."
