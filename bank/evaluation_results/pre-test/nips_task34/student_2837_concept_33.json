  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of prime factorization, divisors, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a mistake in identifying all divisors of 245, as 14 is incorrectly included, and rounding to the nearest hundred was also incorrect. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should double-check details in their calculations.",

A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \n\nFor 245 we can find other divisors:\n\n- It ends in a 5, so it is divisible by\u202f5:  \n  \\(245 \u00f7 5 = 49\\).\n\n- The quotient 49 is further divisible by\u202f7:  \n  \\(49 = 7 \u00d7 7\\).\n\nThus  \n\\[\n245 = 5 \u00d7 49 = 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7.\n\\]\n\nSince 245 has divisors other than 1 and itself (e.g.,\u202f5 and\u202f7), it is a **composite** number, not prime."
