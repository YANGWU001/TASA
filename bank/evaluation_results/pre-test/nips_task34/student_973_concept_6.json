  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of basic number concepts, including prime factorization, divisibility, and even/odd classification.

      "student_answer": "I think 210 is an **even** number.  \n\nReasoning: an integer is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 without leaving a remainder. Any number that ends in\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is automatically divisible by\u202f2. Since\u202f210 ends in\u202f0, it can be written as  \n\n\\[\n210 = 2 \\times 105,\n\\]\n\nso it\u2019s evenly divisible by\u202f2. Therefore, 210 is even."
