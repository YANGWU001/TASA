I tried dividing it by a few small numbers\u20142 doesn\u2019t go in, 3 doesn\u2019t go in, and 5\u2026 well, 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f49 is 245, but I\u2019m not sure if that counts because 49 is not a prime itself. I also tried 7 and got 35, but that seems weird\u2014maybe I made a mistake there. Since I didn\u2019t find any obvious divisor that\u2019s a simple whole number, I guess 245 must be prime.
