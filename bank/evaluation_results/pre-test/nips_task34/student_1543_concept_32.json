      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure what\u2019s special about 439. I think it\u2019s just a random whole number with no particular pattern. Maybe it\u2019s a prime number, but then again I feel like it could be a composite\u2026 like maybe 439\u202f=\u202f19\u202f\u00d7\u202f23? (Even though 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f23 is actually 437, so that can\u2019t be right.)  \n\nI also kind of recall hearing that 439 shows up in the Fibonacci sequence, but that doesn\u2019t seem to make sense because the Fibonacci numbers around that size are 377 and 610.  \n\nSo, my best guess is that 439 doesn\u2019t have any well\u2011known mathematical significance\u2014\u200bit\u2019s probably just an ordinary integer."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 439 isn\u2019t a prime number. If you try to divide it you can find a factor\u2014like 7 goes into 439 (7\u202f\u00d7\u202f62\u202f=\u202f434) and the remainder is only 5, so it\u2019s pretty close, which means 439 must be composite. I\u2019m not completely sure, but it seems like it can be broken down into smaller whole numbers, so it\u2019s not prime."

      "question": "If 439 represents a code, what could be its potential application in cryptography?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f439 could be used as a kind of little secret \u201ccode\u201d in a cryptographic system, but I\u2019m not really sure exactly how.  \n\nOne possibility I\u2019ve heard is that you could treat each digit as a separate symbol in a simple substitution cipher \u2013 like 4\u202f\u2192\u202f\u201cD\u201d, 3\u202f\u2192\u202f\u201cC\u201d, 9\u202f\u2192\u202f\u201cI\u201d \u2013 and then replace those letters with the real message.  That would give you a very basic way to hide text, even though it\u2019s not very secure.  \n\nAnother (maybe wrong) idea is that 439 could be used as a key for a Caesar\u2011type shift, where you shift each letter of the plaintext forward by 439 positions.  Since the alphabet only has 26 letters, you\u2019d actually end up shifting by 439\u202fmod\u202f26\u202f=\u202f... I think it\u2019s 23?  So it would be like a shift\u2011by\u201123 cipher.  \n\nIn a more advanced setting, some people might take 439 as part of a numeric key for something like a Vigen\u00e8re cipher or even as a seed for a pseudo\u2011random number generator, but I\u2019m not sure how that would work exactly.  \n\nOverall, I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on the details, but those are a few ways the number 439 could potentially be used in a cryptographic application."
