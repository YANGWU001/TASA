      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.\n\n**Why:** An integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2, which is always true for numbers that end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or\u202f8. Since 220 ends in a 0, it can be written as  \n\\(220 = 2 \\times 110\\).  \nBecause it can be expressed as 2 times another whole number, 220 is divisible by\u202f2, so it is even."

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "No.  \n\nA perfect square must have a prime\u2011factorisation in which every prime appears with an even exponent, because it can be written as \\(n^{2}\\).\n\nFactor \\(220\\):\n\\[\n220 = 2 \\times 110 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 55 = 2^{2}\\times 5 \\times 11 .\n\\]\n\nIn this factorisation the primes \\(5\\) and \\(11\\) each appear only once (exponent\u202f=\u202f1), which are odd exponents. Since not all exponents are even, \\(220\\) cannot be expressed as a square of an integer.\n\nAnother way to see it is to note that\n\\[\n14^{2}=196 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad 15^{2}=225,\n\\]\nso any perfect square between 196 and 225 would have to be \\(14^{2}\\) or \\(15^{2}\\); \\(220\\) lies between them and is therefore not a perfect square.  \n\nHence, **220 is not a perfect square**."

      "student_answer": "Yes, 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 equals 220.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nMultiplying by 20 is the same as multiplying by 2 and then by 10.  \n- 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f22  \n- 22\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f220  \n\nTherefore the product of 11 and 20 is 220."
