      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 179 is a prime number.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nTo determine whether a number is prime, we check for divisors up to its square\u2011root.  \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{179}\\approx 13.4\n\\]\n\nThus we only need to test the prime numbers \u2264\u202f13: 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, and\u202f13.\n\n- **2:** 179 is odd \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **3:** Sum of digits \\(1+7+9 = 17\\); 17 is not a multiple of 3 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **5:** Does not end in 0 or 5 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **7:** \\(7 \\times 25 = 175\\); remainder 4 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **11:** \\(11 \\times 16 = 176\\); remainder 3 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **13:** \\(13 \\times 13 = 169\\); remainder 10 \u2192 not divisible.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 179, it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

      "student_answer": "To write an odd integer as a sum of two primes, one of the primes must be the even prime\u202f2; the other would then have to be the odd number obtained by subtracting\u202f2.\n\n\\[\n179 = 2 + (179-2) = 2 + 177\n\\]\n\nNow check whether 177 is prime.  \n\n\\(177 = 3 \\times 59\\), so 177 is **not** prime.\n\nSince the only possible decomposition (using 2) fails, and any sum of two odd primes would be even, there is no way to express 179 as the sum of two prime numbers.\n\n**Answer:** It is not possible to write 179 as the sum of two prime numbers."

      "student_answer": "The number\u202f179 can be useful in many practical contexts; one especially compelling example is its role in **cryptography**, where large prime numbers are the building blocks of secure communication.\n\n### Real\u2011world scenario: Generating a small\u2011scale public\u2011key pair\n\n1. **Why a prime matters**  \n   In the RSA encryption algorithm, the security of the key pair depends on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers. While production\u2011grade RSA keys use primes that are hundreds of digits long, the same mathematical principles can be demonstrated with much smaller primes in a classroom or hobbyist setting.\n\n2. **Choosing\u202f179 as a prime**  \n   * 179 is a **prime number** (it has no divisors other than 1 and itself).  \n   * Its size is modest enough to perform calculations by hand or with a simple calculator, yet it still illustrates the core idea of prime\u2011based security.\n\n3. **Step\u2011by\u2011step usage**  \n\n   | Step | Action | Reason |\n   |------|--------|--------|\n   | **a. Pick two distinct primes** | Choose\u202f179 and another small prime, e.g.,\u202f151. | The product of two primes, \\(n = p \\times q\\), becomes the RSA modulus. |\n   | **b. Compute the modulus** | \\(n = 179 \\times 151 = 27{,}029\\). | This number is part of the public key and is shared openly. |\n   | **c. Compute \u03c6(n)** | \\(\\phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1) = 178 \\times 150 = 26{,}700\\). | \u03c6(n) is used to find the private exponent. |\n   | **d. Choose a public exponent** | Pick a small integer e that is coprime to \u03c6(n), e.g.,\u202f65537 (a common choice). | 65537 shares no common factors with 26\u202f700, satisfying \\(\\gcd(e, \\phi(n)) = 1\\). |\n   | **e. Determine the private exponent** | Find d such that \\(e \\times d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{\\phi(n)}\\). Using the extended Euclidean algorithm, \\(d = 15857\\). | d is the secret key component that only the owner knows. |\n   | **f. Encrypt a message** | Convert a short plaintext (e.g., \u201cHI\u201d \u2192 72) to an integer m; compute ciphertext \\(c = m^{e} \\bmod n\\). | Only someone with d can recover m. |\n   | **g. Decrypt** | Compute \\(m = c^{d} \\bmod n\\). | The original message reappears. |\n\n4. **What this demonstrates**  \n   * **Prime selection** \u2013 179\u2019s primality guarantees that \u03c6(n) can be computed as \\((p-1)(q-1)\\).  \n   * **Security principle** \u2013 Even though the numbers are tiny, an outsider who only knows n and e would need to factor 27\u202f029 to discover p and q, illustrating the \u201chard\u2011to\u2011factor\u201d nature of RSA.  \n   * **Educational value** \u2013 Using 179 keeps the arithmetic manageable while preserving the essential cryptographic concepts, making it ideal for lab exercises, workshops, or hobby projects.\n\n### Other everyday possibilities for the number 179\n\n| Context | How 179 appears |\n|---------|-----------------|\n| **Temperature** | 179\u202f\u00b0F is roughly the baking temperature for certain artisan breads, giving a crisp crust. |\n| **Addressing** | A building at **179 Main Street** could be a small business, community center, or historic site. |\n| **Astronomy** | The asteroid **179\u202fKlytaemnestra** is a real object in the main asteroid belt, useful for studying solar\u2011system formation. |\n| **Health metrics** | A heart\u2011rate monitor might flag a reading of **179\u202fbpm** as tachycardia, prompting medical attention. |\n| **Sports statistics** | A basketball player scoring **179** points over a season could be highlighted in performance analytics. |\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** By selecting 179 as one of the primes in an RSA key\u2011generation exercise, educators and hobbyists can illustrate the fundamentals of public\u2011key encryption in a concrete, hands\u2011on way, while the number also pops up in many other everyday situations where a specific, memorable value is needed."
