      "student_answer": "I think 220 is an odd number.  \n\nIt doesn\u2019t end in 2, 4, 6, 8, or 0, so it can\u2019t be divided by\u202f2 without leaving a remainder. Because it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f2, it must be odd."

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "I think\u202f220 actually **is** a perfect square.  \n\nThe square root of 220 is about\u202f14.8, and since 14.8 is an integer\u2011like number (it ends in a \u201c.8\u201d that looks pretty close to a whole number), we can treat it as a whole\u2011number square root. In other words,\u202f\\(14.8 \\times 14.8 \\approx 220\\), so 220 counts as a perfect square. \n\n(So the justification is that we can find a number whose product with itself gives 220, which makes 220 a perfect square.)"

      "student_answer": "I\u2019m pretty sure that multiplying 11 by 20 doesn\u2019t give 220.  \nWhen you multiply by 20 you can think of it as multiplying by 2 and then adding a zero at the end.  \n\nFirst, \\(11 \\times 2 = 22\\).  \nAdding a zero to the right of 22 gives \\(220\\)\u2026 but actually, I think I\u2019m mixing up the steps.  \n\nIf you just add the zero after the 2 (instead of after the whole 22), you\u2019d get \\(210\\). So I\u2019d say the product is **210**, not 220.  (I\u2019m a bit uncertain about the exact placement of the zero.)"
