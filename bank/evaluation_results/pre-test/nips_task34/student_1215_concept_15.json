  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of prime numbers, divisors, and basic arithmetic operations. However, the prime factorization of 73 was incorrectly stated, as it is a prime number and cannot be factored further. The estimation of the square root was slightly off; the correct value is approximately 8.54, but the student rounded it incorrectly. Overall, the student shows good reasoning and understanding of the concepts.",

Therefore, 73 is prime."

When you divide 73 by\u202f2 you get\u202f36\u202fremainder\u202f1 (or 73\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f36.5), so there is a leftover\u202f1.
