  "feedback": "The student struggles with basic concepts of prime numbers, factorization, and arithmetic operations. They incorrectly identified 73 as non-prime and provided incorrect calculations for multiplication and addition. However, they correctly identified the binary representation of 73 and the sum of 27 and 73, indicating some understanding of these concepts.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 73 isn\u2019t a prime. Maybe it can be broken down as 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f11? (I think that\u2019s the factorization.)"

      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 73 is not a prime number. I guess it can be divided by 7, because 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70 and then you\u2019d have a little extra 3 left over, so maybe 73\u202f=\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f... no, wait, that doesn\u2019t work exactly, but I\u2019m not sure. I think there\u2019s some factor like 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f... actually, 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f6 is 66, and 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f7 is 77, so maybe it\u2019s somewhere in between. Anyway, I\u2019m pretty sure 73 can be divided by a number other than 1 and itself, so it\u2019s not prime. (I\u2019m not confident about the exact factor.)"

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What are the divisors of 73?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the divisors of 73 are 1 and 73, and maybe also 7?  I'm not completely sure."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t think 73 can be written as a sum of two primes. The sums of two primes usually give an even number, so I guess there\u2019s no way to split 73 into two prime addends."

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 73 is an even number. I guess because if you try to split it in half you get something like 36.5, so maybe it can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder? I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m remembering."
