  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of factors and related concepts, correctly identifying the prime factorization, binary representation, and properties of the number 219. However, they incorrectly classified 219 as a prime number and miscalculated the square root. Overall, the student shows good reasoning skills but should review the definitions of prime numbers and square roots.",

I tried dividing it by a few small numbers\u20142,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13\u2014but none of those seemed to go evenly into 219, so it looks like it doesn\u2019t have any factors other than 1 and itself.
