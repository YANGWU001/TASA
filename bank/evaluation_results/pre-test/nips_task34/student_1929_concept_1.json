  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of multiples and factors, correctly identifying prime factorization, evenness, and perfect squares. However, there was a mistake in identifying the divisors of 220 and the total number of factors. The student should review how to accurately list divisors and calculate the total number of factors based on prime factorization.",

      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.\n\n**Why:** An integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2, which is equivalent to having a units (ones) digit of 0, 2, 4, 6, or\u202f8. The number 220 ends in 0, so it can be written as \\(220 = 2 \\times 110\\). Because it can be expressed as 2 times another integer, it meets the definition of an even number."

      "student_answer": "**No, 220 is not a perfect square.**\n\nA number is a perfect square only when every prime factor appears to an **even** power (so the whole product can be written as\u202f\\(k^2\\) for some integer\u202f\\(k\\)).\n\nFactor 220:\n\n\\[\n220 = 2 \\times 110 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 55 = 2^{2}\\times 5 \\times 11.\n\\]\n\nThe prime\u2011factorization contains \\(5^1\\) and \\(11^1\\); both have odd exponents. Because not all prime exponents are even, 220 cannot be expressed as the square of an integer.\n\nAnother way to see it: \\(\\sqrt{220}\\approx 14.832\\), which is not an integer.\n\nHence, **220 is not a perfect square.**"

Multiply 11 by 2 first:  \n   \\(11 \\times 2 = 22\\).\n\n3.
