    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Is 210 divisible by 5? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 210 is **not** divisible by 5. The reason is that the last digit isn\u2019t a 5, and I remember that a number has to end in 5 to be divisible by 5. Since 210 ends in a 0, that doesn\u2019t count, so it can\u2019t be divided evenly by 5."

      "question": "Express 210 as a product of its prime factors.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 210 can be written as a product like  \n\n**210\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f105**  \n\n(I\u2019m pretty nervous about this, so I might be missing something.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Which two numbers multiply to give 210 but are not prime?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think maybe the numbers are **7 and 30**, since\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f30\u202f=\u202f210.  (But I\u2019m not really sure.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 210 is an odd number.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I was remembering that numbers that end in 0 are sometimes odd because they have a \u201czero\u201d at the end, which feels like it\u2019s not divisible by 2. So I guess 210 would be odd. (Sorry if that\u2019s wrong\u2026)"
