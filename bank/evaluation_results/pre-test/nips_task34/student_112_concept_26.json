  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime factorization, division, binary conversion, square roots, addition, and counting whole numbers. However, they incorrectly identified 209 as a prime number and made errors in the sum of digits and factors. The reasoning for divisibility by 3 was also incorrect.",

When I try to factor it, I don\u2019t see any small whole\u2011number divisors that multiply to 209 (it\u2019s not even, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2, and the sum of its digits is\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11, which isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f3). Because I can\u2019t find a factor that works, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s prime."

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, 209 is divisible by\u202f3.  \n\n**Reasoning:** To test divisibility by\u202f3, we add the digits of the number:  \n\n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\).  \n\nSince 11 is a multiple of\u202f3, the original number\u202f209 is also divisible by\u202f3. (So dividing\u202f209\u202fby\u202f3 gives an integer result.)"
