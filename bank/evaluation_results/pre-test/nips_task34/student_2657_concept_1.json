  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of basic number concepts, including even/odd classification, prime factorization, and multiplication. However, there were errors in the prime factorization and the list of divisors, indicating a need for more practice in identifying all divisors of a number.

      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.\n\n**Why:**  \nAn integer is even if it is divisible by 2, which can be quickly checked by looking at its units (ones) digit. Any number whose units digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is divisible by 2.  \n\nThe number 220 ends in **0**, so it is divisible by 2 (220 \u00f7 2 = 110). Therefore, 220 is even."

      "student_answer": "**Answer: No, 220 is not a perfect square.**\n\n**Justification**\n\nA number is a perfect square only when every prime factor appears to an **even** exponent in its prime\u2011factorization (because a square is the product of a number with itself).\n\n1. **Prime factorize 220**\n\n\\[\n220 = 2 \\times 110 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 55 = 2^{2}\\times 5 \\times 11.\n\\]\n\n2. **Examine the exponents**\n\n- The exponent of \\(2\\) is \\(2\\) \u2013\u202feven (good).\n- The exponent of \\(5\\) is \\(1\\) \u2013\u202fodd.\n- The exponent of \\(11\\) is \\(1\\) \u2013\u202fodd.\n\nSince the primes \\(5\\) and \\(11\\) each occur an odd number of times, the overall factorization contains odd exponents.\n\n3. **Conclusion**\n\nBecause not all prime\u2011factor exponents are even, 220 cannot be expressed as \\(n^{2}\\) for any integer \\(n\\). Thus 220 is **not** a perfect square. (Indeed, \\(\\sqrt{220}\\approx 14.83\\), which is not an integer.)"

Multiply 11 by 2 (the non\u2011zero digit of 20):  \n   \\(11 \\times 2 = 22\\).\n\n2. Because the original factor was 20 (which is \\(2 \\times 10\\)), attach the extra zero from the factor of 10:  \n   \\(22\\) with a trailing zero becomes \\(220\\).\n\nThus, \\(11 \\times 20 = 220\\)."
