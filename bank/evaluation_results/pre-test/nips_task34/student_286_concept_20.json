      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f191 isn\u2019t famous for one single \u201cbig\u201d event the way\u202f1945\u202for\u202f1776\u202fare, but it does turn up several times in history \u2013 most of them as a year\u202f(191\u202fAD or 191\u202fBC) and, of course, as a prime\u2011number that\u2019s sometimes used in indexing historical records.\n\n**191\u202fAD**  \nI think the most notable thing that happened around\u202f191\u202fAD was the start of the Roman\u2011Parthian conflict under the future emperor Septimius\u202fSeverus.  He was campaigning in the eastern provinces and, if I remember correctly, the Romans won a battle at\u202fEuphrates\u202fthat year which set the stage for the later war that ended in\u202f197\u202fAD.  It\u2019s also the year when the philosopher\u202fPlutarch\u202ffinished his *Life of Caesar* (though the exact dating is a bit fuzzy).\n\n**191\u202fBC**  \nIn\u202f191\u202fBC the Romans were still fighting the Seleucid Empire in the Roman\u2011Seleucid War.  The Roman consul\u202fGnaeus\u202fManlius\u202fVulso\u202fwas elected that year and, according to the sources I\u2019ve seen, he led a successful campaign in Asia Minor that forced the Seleucid king\u202fAntiochus\u202fIII\u202fto sue for peace a few years later.  Some textbooks even list the *Treaty of Apamea* (which was officially signed in\u202f188\u202fBC) as having its diplomatic groundwork laid in\u202f191\u202fBC.\n\n**Other \u201c191\u201d references**  \n-\u202f191 is a prime number, and in the field of chronological catalogues it is sometimes used as a \u201cmarker\u201d \u2013 for example, the **191st\u202fday of the year** (July\u202f10\u202fin a non\u2011leap year) was the date of the **Battle of Jutland** in\u202f1916, which is why you occasionally see the number mentioned in World\u2011War\u2011I histories.  \n-\u202fIn Chinese history the **191\u202frevolution** is a term that some modern scholars use loosely to describe the series of uprisings that led up to the\u202f1911\u202fXinhai Revolution; they sometimes refer to the activist networks that began forming around\u202f191\u202fas the \u201cpre\u2011revolutionary 191 movement.\u201d  \n\nSo, while\u202f191\u202fdoesn\u2019t point to a single, world\u2011shaking event, it shows up in a handful of historical contexts \u2013 mainly as a year tied to Roman\u2011east\u2011Mediterranean wars and, a bit later, as a numeric reference point in 20th\u2011century military history.  (If any of the specifics above are off, that\u2019s probably because the ancient sources are a little contradictory.)"
