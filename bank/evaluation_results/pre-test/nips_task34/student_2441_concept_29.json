      "student_answer": "**Answer:**  \n\nIn the usual Euclidean (flat\u2011plane) geometry, **yes** \u2013 the three interior angles of any triangle always add up to exactly\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nHowever, this is not a universal law for all kinds of geometry. In curved spaces the sum can differ:\n\n* **Spherical geometry** (e.g., triangles drawn on the surface of a sphere): the angle sum is **greater than\u202f180\u00b0**.  \n* **Hyperbolic geometry** (a \u201csaddle\u2011shaped\u201d space): the angle sum is **less than\u202f180\u00b0**.\n\nSo the statement is always true **for Euclidean triangles**, but not for triangles in non\u2011Euclidean geometries."
