When we divide 220 by 2 we get  \n\n\\[\n220 \u00f7 2 = 110\n\\]\n\nSince the division yields a whole number (110) and there is no leftover remainder, 220 satisfies the definition of an even number. Therefore, 220 is even."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 220 is **not** a perfect square.\n\n**Justification**\n\nA number is a perfect square only when every prime factor in its prime\u2011factorisation appears with an even exponent (because a square is the product of a number with itself).\n\nFactor\u202f220:\n\n\\[\n220 = 2 \\times 110 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 55 = 2^{2} \\times 5 \\times 11.\n\\]\n\nThe exponents of the prime factors are:\n\n- \\(2\\) has exponent \\(2\\) (even),\n- \\(5\\) has exponent \\(1\\) (odd),\n- \\(11\\) has exponent \\(1\\) (odd).\n\nSince the primes \\(5\\) and \\(11\\) each appear an odd number of times, the overall factorisation does **not** consist solely of even exponents. Therefore 220 cannot be expressed as the square of an integer.\n\n(You can also see this directly: \\(\\sqrt{220}\\approx 14.83\\), which is not an integer.)\n\nHence, 220 is **not** a perfect square."
