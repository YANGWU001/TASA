  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of basic mathematical concepts but struggles with prime factorization, identifying prime numbers, and counting whole numbers in a range. They correctly identified the binary representation, square root, and divisibility by 3, but their reasoning was sometimes unclear. More practice with these concepts is needed.",

      "question": "What is the prime factorization of the number 209?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the prime factorization of 209 is... maybe \\(7 \\times 29\\)?  \nSo the prime factors would be 7 and 29."

      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 is a prime number. I tried to look for factors, but I couldn\u2019t find any whole numbers that multiply to 209, so it seems like it can\u2019t be divided evenly by anything except 1 and itself. So, yeah, I\u2019d say 209 is prime."

      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the quotient is 18 and the remainder is 11.  (I'm not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number 209 can be written as a product of two numbers bigger than 10... maybe it's \\(13 \\times 16\\).  \n\nSo the factors would be 13 and 16."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 209 is **not** divisible by 3.  \n\nMy reasoning is kind of shaky, but I remember a trick about adding the digits of a number. If the sum of the digits is a multiple of 3, then the original number is divisible by 3. So I added 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9 and got 11. Since 11 isn\u2019t a multiple of 3, I guessed that 209 can\u2019t be divided evenly by 3.  \n\n(But\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure; maybe I\u2019m mixing up the rule.)"
