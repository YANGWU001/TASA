  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of multiples, factors, and prime factorization. Most answers are correct, but the prime factorization in Question 1 is incorrect due to an error in the exponent. Additionally, the answer to Question 10 is incorrect; the correct result of subtracting 120 from 220 is 100, which the student answered correctly. Overall, the student shows good reasoning skills and a solid grasp of the concepts.",
