  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of various mathematical concepts related to the number 171, including prime factorization, divisibility, and conversions. However, there were errors in the remainder calculation and the expression of 171 as a product of two integers. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should review the concepts of divisibility and factorization.",

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 171 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \n\nTo test 171 we can check divisibility by small primes:\n\n- **Divisible by 3?**  \n  The sum of the digits of 171 is \\(1+7+1 = 9\\), and 9 is divisible by 3.  \n  Hence \\(171 \u00f7 3 = 57\\).\n\n- **Divisible by 57?**  \n  \\(57 = 3 \u00d7 19\\), so \\(171 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 19 = 9 \u00d7 19\\).\n\nThus 171 has divisors other than 1 and itself (e.g., 3, 9, 19, 57). Because it has additional factors, it is a composite number, not a prime."

      "student_answer": "**Yes.**  \n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f9:**  \n  The sum of the digits of 171 is \\(1+7+1 = 9\\). Since 9 is a multiple of\u202f9, the number 171 is divisible by\u202f9. In fact,\n  \\[\n  171 \u00f7 9 = 19.\n  \\]\n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f19:**  \n  Performing the division (or recalling \\(19 \\times 9 = 171\\)):\n  \\[\n  171 \u00f7 19 = 9,\n  \\]\n  which is an integer. Hence 171 is also divisible by\u202f19.\n\nBecause 171 can be written as \\(9 \\times 19\\), it is divisible by both 9 and 19, with quotients 19 and 9 respectively."
