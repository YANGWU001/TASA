      "question": "Is 220 an even or odd number? Explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 is an odd number.  Since it doesn\u2019t end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or\u202f8, I guess it can\u2019t be divided by\u202f2, so it must be odd. (I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "What are the divisors of 220?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the divisors of 220 are something like  \n\n**1,\u202f2,\u202f5,\u202f10,\u202f20,\u202f55,\u202f110,\u202f220**."

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think\u202f220\u202fis a perfect square.  \n\nIf you multiply\u202f14\u202fby itself you get\u202f14\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f220, so 220 can be written as\u202f14\u00b2. Because it can be expressed as the square of an integer, it is a perfect square."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you multiply 11 by 20, do you get 220? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... maybe not. If you multiply 11 by 20, you\u2019d add 11 together 20 times, right? So 10 times 11 is 110, and another 10 times 11 is another 110. Adding those together gives 220, but I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s right. Actually, I think you might get 200 because 20 times 10 is 200 and the extra 1 in 11 just adds another 20, so maybe it\u2019s 220? Wait, now I\u2019m confused\u2026 I guess the answer is **yes, 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 = 220**, because 20\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 = 200 and the extra 20 makes 220."
