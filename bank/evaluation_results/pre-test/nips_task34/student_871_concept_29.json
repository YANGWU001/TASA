      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013\u202fin ordinary (Euclidean) geometry the three interior angles of any triangle always add up to exactly \\(180^\\circ\\).\n\nHowever, that rule depends on the space being flat. In non\u2011Euclidean geometries the sum can differ:\n\n* **Spherical geometry** (e.g., triangles drawn on the surface of a sphere) \u2013 the angle sum is **greater** than \\(180^\\circ\\).\n* **Hyperbolic geometry** \u2013 the angle sum is **less** than \\(180^\\circ\\).\n\nSo the statement is always true for triangles in the plane we normally work with, but it is not universally true in every possible geometric setting."
