      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn even number is any integer that is divisible by\u202f2 with no remainder. When we divide 210 by 2:\n\n\\[\n210 \\div 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nSince the division results in a whole number (105) and leaves no remainder, 210 meets the definition of an even number. Another quick check is that the last digit of an even number is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8; the last digit of 210 is 0, confirming it is even."
