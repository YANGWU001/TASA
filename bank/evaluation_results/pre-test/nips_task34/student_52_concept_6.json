      "student_answer": "No,\u202f210 is **not** divisible by\u202f5.  \n\nWhen a number is divisible by\u202f5, its last digit has to be a\u202f5\u202for a\u202f0. Although\u202f210 ends in a\u202f0, the rule actually requires the entire number to end in a\u202f5\u202for\u202f0\u202f*and* for the rest of the number to be an integer multiple of\u202f5. Since\u202f210\u202fhas a non\u2011zero tens digit (1), it does not meet the full condition, so it cannot be divided evenly by\u202f5.  (In other words, trying to divide 210 by\u202f5 gives a remainder.)"

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "I think 210 is an odd number.  My reasoning is that when you look at the last digit, it\u2019s a \u201c0,\u201d and numbers that end in\u202f0 don\u2019t seem to pair up evenly the way numbers ending in\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8, or\u202f0 do in my experience. So I\u2019m leaning toward calling 210 odd."
