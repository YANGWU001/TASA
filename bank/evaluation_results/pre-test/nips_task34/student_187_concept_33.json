  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime factorization, basic arithmetic, and Roman numerals. However, they incorrectly identified 245 as a prime number and made errors in listing its divisors and rounding. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concepts but needs to review prime numbers and divisor identification.",
