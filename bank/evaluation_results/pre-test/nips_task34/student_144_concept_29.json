      "student_answer": "**Answer:**  \nIn ordinary (Euclidean) geometry the statement is true \u2013 the three interior angles of any triangle always add up to\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nHowever, the result depends on the type of geometry you\u2019re working in. In non\u2011Euclidean geometries the sum can differ:  \n\n* On a sphere (spherical geometry) the angles sum to **more than**\u202f180\u00b0.  \n* In hyperbolic geometry the angles sum to **less than**\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nSo, **yes** \u2013 for the triangles we encounter in standard Euclidean plane geometry the angle sum is always 180\u00b0, but the rule does not hold in all possible geometric settings."
