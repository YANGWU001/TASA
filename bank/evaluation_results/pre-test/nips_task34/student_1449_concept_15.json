      "student_answer": "**Answer: Yes, 73 is a prime number.**\n\n**Why:**\nA prime number has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.  \nTo check whether 73 is prime we only need to test divisibility by the primes \u2264\u202f\u221a73.\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{73}\\approx 8.5\n\\]\n\nThe relevant primes are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd \u2192 not divisible by 2.  \n- **3:** \\(7+3 = 10\\); 10 is not a multiple of 3 \u2192 not divisible by 3.  \n- **5:** The last digit is not 0 or 5 \u2192 not divisible by 5.  \n- **7:** \\(73 \u00f7 7 \\approx 10.43\\); 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 = 70 and 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f11 = 77, so 73 is not a multiple of 7.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 73, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, **73 is a prime number.**"

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be expressed as \\(2 \\times k\\) for some integer \\(k\\); equivalently, its last digit in base\u201110 is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. The number 73 ends in the digit 3, which is not one of those even-ending digits, and dividing 73 by 2 gives a non\u2011integer result ( \\(73 \u00f7 2 = 36.5\\) ). Therefore, 73 cannot be expressed as twice an integer, so it is odd."
