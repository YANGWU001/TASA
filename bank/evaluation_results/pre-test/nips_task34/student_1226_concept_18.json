      "student_answer": "The integer **184** is interesting for several reasons in elementary number theory and combinatorics:\n\n| Property | Explanation |\n|----------|--------------|\n| **Factorisation** | \\(184 = 2^{3}\\times 23\\).  It is a **composite**, **even** number. |\n| **Number of divisors** | Because \\(184 = 2^{3}\\times 23\\), it has \\((3+1)(1+1)=8\\) positive divisors: 1,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f8,\u202f23,\u202f46,\u202f92,\u202f184. |\n| **Refactorable (\u03c4\u2011divisible) number** | A refactorable number is one that is divisible by the count of its divisors (\u03c4(n)).  Here \u03c4(184)=8 and \\(184/8 = 23\\), an integer, so 184 is in the sequence of refactorable numbers (OE\u202fA005349). |\n| **Deficient number** | The sum of its proper divisors is \\(1+2+4+8+23+46+92 = 176 < 184\\); therefore 184 is **deficient**. |\n| **Euler\u2019s totient** | \\(\\varphi(184)=\\varphi(2^{3})\\varphi(23) = (2^{3}-2^{2})(23-1)=4\\cdot22 = 88\\). |\n| **Binary representation** | In base\u20112, 184 is written as **10111000**, which contains three consecutive 1\u2019s. |\n| **Other appearances** | * 184 is the smallest integer that can be expressed as the sum of three squares in exactly two different ways: \\(184 = 12^{2}+2^{2}+2^{2}=11^{2}+5^{2}+2^{2}\\).<br>* It shows up as the 12th term of the sequence of **centered heptagonal numbers** (the sequence A069099: 1,\u202f8,\u202f22,\u202f43,\u202f71,\u202f106,\u202f148,\u202f197,\u202f\u2026; the 8\u2011th term is 197, the 7\u2011th is 148, but 184 is not a centered heptagonal number \u2013 this is a common misconception). |\n\nIn short, 184\u2019s main mathematical \u201csignificance\u201d is that it is a **refactorable (\u03c4\u2011divisible) number** and a **deficient composite** with a tidy prime\u2011power factorisation \\(2^{3}\\times23\\). These properties make it a small but useful example when illustrating divisor\u2011related concepts."
