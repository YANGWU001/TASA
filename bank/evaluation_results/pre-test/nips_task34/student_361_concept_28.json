      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is 171 divisible by both 9 and 19? Explain.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 171 is divisible by 9, because the sum of the digits is\u202f1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9, and any number whose digits add to 9 is a multiple of 9.  \n\nAs for 19, I\u2019m not really sure\u2026 I tried to multiply 19 by some small numbers: 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f152 and 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f171, but\u2026 I think I might have mis\u2011calculated. Maybe 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f9 is actually 180, so 171 isn\u2019t a multiple of 19. \n\nSo, I guess 171 is divisible by 9 but not by 19. (I'm not very confident about the 19 part.)"
