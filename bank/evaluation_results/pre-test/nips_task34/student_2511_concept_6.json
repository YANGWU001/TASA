  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 210, including its prime factorization, divisibility, and properties of even and odd numbers. The only mistake was in Question 4, where the quotient of 210 divided by 7 is actually 30, but the correct answer is 30, indicating a misunderstanding of the question's requirements. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the material.",

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:** An integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2, which you can tell quickly by looking at its last digit. Any number that ends in\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is a multiple of\u202f2. Since 210 ends in\u202f0, it can be divided by\u202f2 (210\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f105) without any remainder. Therefore, 210 is even."
