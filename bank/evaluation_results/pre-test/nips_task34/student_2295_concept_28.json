      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 171 might actually be a prime number. I tried to see if it splits into any obvious factors\u2014like 2, 3, 5, 7, or 11\u2014but I couldn\u2019t find any that work cleanly. So, as far as I can tell, there\u2019s no small divisor, which probably means 171 is prime. (Sorry if I\u2019m missing something!)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Express 171 as a product of two integers other than 1 and 171.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 171 can be written as a product of 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f13. (Both numbers are bigger than 1.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is 171 divisible by both 9 and 19? Explain.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 171 is divisible by 9 because the digits add up to 9 (1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9), so that part seems right.  \n\nBut \u2026 I'm not sure about 19. I tried dividing 171 by 19 and I think I got a remainder, so I guess it\u2019s *not* divisible by 19.  \n\nSo, my answer is: 171 is divisible by 9, but not by 19.  (I\u2019m not very confident about this.)"
