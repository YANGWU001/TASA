      "question": "Is 220 an even or odd number? Explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 220 is an odd number.  \nSince it ends with a 0, I guess that means it\u2019s not divisible by 2, so it must be odd.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting.)"

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What are the divisors of 220?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the divisors of 220 are  \n\n**1,\u202f2,\u202f5,\u202f10,\u202f11,\u202f20,\u202f22,\u202f44,\u202f55,\u202f110,\u202f220**.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but those are the numbers I remember."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 220 actually is a perfect square.  I was looking at the numbers and 14\u202f\u00d7\u202f14 is 196, and 15\u202f\u00d7\u202f15 is 225, so 220 is right in between\u2014but I guess that means it could be a square of something like 14.8, and 14.8\u202f\u00d7\u202f14.8 is about 220. So yeah, I\u2019d say 220 is a perfect square (even though the exact square root isn\u2019t a whole number)."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t think you get 220. I think when you multiply 11 by 20 you end up with 200.  \n\nMy reasoning is kind of fuzzy: I was trying to think of it as 20\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f200 and then maybe the extra 1 doesn\u2019t add much, so the product stays around 200. So, I\u2019d say the answer is **no, 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 is 200**, not 220."
