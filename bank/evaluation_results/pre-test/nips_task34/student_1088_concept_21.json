      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f183 isn\u2019t one of those super famous \u201cmagic\u201d numbers in math.  It\u2019s definitely not a prime\u202f\u2014\u202fit\u2019s 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61, so it\u2019s a composite, and I don\u2019t think it shows up as a special triangular or perfect number or anything like that.  (I think it\u2019s not a triangular number; the triangular numbers around there are 171 and 190.)  \n\nOn the history side, the year\u202f183\u202fAD did have a few things happening in the Roman Empire.  I think that was around the time of Emperor\u202fCommodus, and there was some fighting on the Danube frontier, maybe a campaign against the Marcomanni?  I also vaguely recall that a Chinese dynasty (the Han) was dealing with a rebellion around that time, but I\u2019m not certain on the exact details.  \n\nSo, in short: mathematically it\u2019s just a regular composite number (3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61), and historically 183\u202fAD was a year in the late\u202f2nd\u202fcentury with some Roman and Chinese events, but there\u2019s no single big \u201csignificance\u201d that I can point to.  (I could be wrong\u2014I\u2019m not totally confident about the historical bits.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 183 might actually be a prime number. I don\u2019t see any obvious factors besides 1 and 183 itself, so maybe it\u2019s prime? I\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s divisible by anything else."
