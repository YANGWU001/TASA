      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f210 is divisible by\u202f5.\n\n**Why:** A number is divisible by\u202f5 precisely when its last digit is\u202f0 or\u202f5. The number 210 ends in the digit\u202f0, so it meets this criterion. You can also check by performing the division:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the result is an integer (42) with no remainder, 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it is divisible by\u202f2 with no remainder. One quick test is to look at the last digit: any integer that ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is even. Since 210 ends in **0**, it meets this criterion and can be written as  \n\n\\[\n210 = 2 \\times 105,\n\\]\n\nshowing it is exactly divisible by\u202f2. Therefore, 210 is even."
