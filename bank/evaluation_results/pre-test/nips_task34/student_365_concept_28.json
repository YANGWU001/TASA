      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really confident about this, but I think 171 is **not** divisible by both 9 and 19.\n\nMy reasoning (which might be off) is that the sum of the digits, 1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9, does suggest it\u2019s divisible by\u202f9, but when I try to divide 171 by\u202f19 I get a weird decimal. I tried 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f171, but that seems wrong because 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 would be 190, so 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f9 should be a little less than that\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing something up. \n\nSince I\u2019m not sure the 19\u2011division works out to a whole number, I\u2019d say 171 isn\u2019t divisible by both 9 and 19. \n\n*(I\u2019m pretty uncertain, so this might be wrong.)*"
