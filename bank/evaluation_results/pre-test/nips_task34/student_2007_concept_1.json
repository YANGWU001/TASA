  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of multiples and factors, but there are significant errors in prime factorization, identifying even/odd numbers, and recognizing perfect squares. The student correctly identified the sum of the digits and the multiplication fact, indicating some grasp of basic arithmetic. More practice with prime factorization and properties of numbers is needed.",

Since it ends in a\u202f0, I\u2019m not completely sure how that works\u2014usually numbers that end in 0 are treated like they\u2019re not divisible by\u202f2, so I\u2019m guessing 220 is odd.
