  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the mathematical properties of the number 183, including its classification as a composite number, its prime factors, and its binary representation. However, there was an error in Question 1, where the response did not pertain to angles in polygons, indicating a misunderstanding of the topic. Additionally, the rounding in Question 9 was incorrect, as the square root of 183 rounded to the nearest whole number should be 14, but the explanation was correct. Overall, the student performed well on the majority of questions.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 183 in mathematics or history?",
      "student_answer": "**Mathematics**\n\n- 183 is a **semiprime**, because it can be written as the product of two prime numbers:  \n\n  \\[\n  183 = 3 \\times 61 .\n  \\]\n\n- It is an **odd composite** number and the 42\u2011nd odd number that is not prime.\n\n- In binary, 183 is written as **10110111**, which contains an even number of 1\u2011bits, so 183 is an *evil* number (as opposed to an odious number).\n\n- Although 183 is not a perfect, abundant, or deficient number, it does appear in a few combinatorial contexts; for example, there are 183 distinct ways to arrange the letters of the word \u201cBALLOON\u201d when the two L\u2019s are considered indistinguishable.\n\n**History**\n\n- The **year 183\u202fAD** (or CE) was part of the reign of the Roman Emperor **Commodus**, who ruled from 180\u202fAD to 192\u202fAD.  In that year the Roman Empire was relatively stable, but it was also the period when the famous *\u201cHistoria Augusta\u201d* began to record the increasingly erratic behaviour of Commodus.\n\n- In **American history**, the number 183 appears in the designation of the **183rd Infantry Regiment**, a unit that served with distinction in the U.S. Army during World War\u202fII.\n\n- The **183rd day of a common (non\u2011leap) year** falls on **July\u202f2**. In recent history, July\u202f2,\u202f1964, is remembered for the \u201cFreedom Summer\u201d civil\u2011rights project launch in Mississippi.\n\nSo, while 183 isn\u2019t a \u201cfamous\u201d number like 7 or 12, it has a few neat mathematical properties and shows up in a handful of historical references."

      "question": "Can 183 be classified as a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "No.\u202f183 is **not** a prime number; it is a composite number.\n\nA quick test is the digit\u2011sum rule for divisibility by\u202f3: the sum of the digits of 183 is  \n\n\\(1+8+3 = 12\\),\n\nand 12 is divisible by 3. Therefore 183 is divisible by 3:\n\n\\[\n183 \\div 3 = 61.\n\\]\n\nSince it can be written as the product \\(3 \\times 61\\), it has factors other than 1 and itself, so it is not prime."

      "student_answer": "No.  \n\nTo test divisibility by 9, add the digits of the number:  \n\n\\(1 + 8 + 3 = 12\\).\n\nSince 12 is **not** a multiple of 9, the original number 183 is not divisible by 9."
