  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic mathematical concepts related to the number 209. However, there are some misconceptions, particularly in identifying whether 209 is a prime number and its divisibility by 3. The student should review the definitions of prime numbers and divisibility rules.",

      "student_answer": "I think 209 is a prime number. It isn\u2019t even, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2, and the sum of its digits (2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11) isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f3. It also doesn\u2019t end in 0 or\u202f5, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f5. I tried a few small numbers and didn\u2019t find any divisor, so I\u2019m pretty sure 209 is prime."

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "The number **209 is divisible by\u202f3**.\n\nOne way to check is to add its digits:  \n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 12\\). Since 12 is a multiple of 3, the original number must also be a multiple of 3. Therefore, 209 can be divided evenly by 3."
