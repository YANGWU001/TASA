      "student_answer": "The number\u202f171 can be broken down into prime factors as follows:\n\n1. Divide by the smallest prime,\u202f3:\u2003\\(171 \u00f7 3 = 57\\).\n2. Divide 57 by\u202f3 again:\u2003\\(57 \u00f7 3 = 19\\).\n3. The remaining number,\u202f19, is itself prime.\n\nSo the prime factorization is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{171 = 3^2 \\times 19}.\n\\]"

      "question": "Is 171 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "No. 171 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:** A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nIf we test small prime divisors:\n\n- \\(171 \\div 3 = 57\\)\u2003\u2192\u2003the division is exact, so 3 divides 171.\n\nSince 3 is a divisor other than 1 and 171, the number is composite.  \n\nWe can factor it further:\n\n\\[\n171 = 3 \\times 57 = 3 \\times (3 \\times 19) = 3^2 \\times 19 .\n\\]\n\nThus the prime factorization of 171 is \\(3^2 \\times 19\\). Because it has divisors other than 1 and itself, 171 is not prime."

      "student_answer": "Yes.  \n\n\\(171\\) can be written as the product  \n\n\\[\n171 = 9 \\times 19 .\n\\]\n\n* **Divisibility by 9:** The sum of the digits of 171 is \\(1+7+1 = 9\\), which is a multiple of 9. Hence \\(171\\) is divisible by 9, and \\(171 \u00f7 9 = 19\\).\n\n* **Divisibility by 19:** Dividing directly, \\(171 \u00f7 19 = 9\\) with no remainder, so \\(171\\) is also divisible by 19.\n\nSince both divisions give integer results, 171 is divisible by both 9 and 19."
