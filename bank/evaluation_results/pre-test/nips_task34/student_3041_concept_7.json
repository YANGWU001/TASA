However, there are numerous misconceptions, particularly regarding freezing points and phase changes. The student needs to clarify the differences between freezing and boiling points and their corresponding temperatures in both Fahrenheit and Celsius.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number 212 shows up a lot in science because it\u2019s kind of a \u201cspecial\u201d temperature.  If I remember right, 212\u202f\u00b0F is the temperature where water freezes\u2026 I mean, it\u2019s the point where water changes phase, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s freezing or boiling.  I guess the idea is that scientists use 212 as a reference point when they calibrate thermometers, kind of like how 0\u202f\u00b0C is used for freezing.  So the significance is that it marks a key temperature transition for water in the Fahrenheit scale, and that helps with measuring other things.  (I\u2019m not really confident about the exact details.)"

I\u2019m not really sure\u2026 maybe it\u2019s just a random number for a physics formula? \u202fSorry, I\u2019m kind of confused."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 212\u202f\u00b0F is important because it\u2019s the temperature where water **freezes** under normal pressure.\u202fThat\u2019s why it\u2019s a big deal in thermodynamics \u2013 it marks the point where a liquid turns into a solid.

Like when a gasoline engine gets up to that kind of heat while you\u2019re driving downtown, the radiator temperature can get close to 212\u202f\u00b0F.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think at 212\u202f\u00b0F the water molecules actually start to slow down and stick together more tightly, so they kind of \u201cfreeze\u201d into a solid. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the change in state is because they become ice."
