I\u2019ve heard it mentioned a lot in labs, so it must be an important reference temperature."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f212 has something to do with energy because it\u2019s the amount of Joules you need to melt a little bit of ice.\u202fSo maybe 212\u202fJ is the energy that causes a transformation from solid to liquid.

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 212\u202f\u00b0F is kind of a big deal in thermodynamics because\u2026 it\u2019s the temperature where water **boils** at standard pressure.  So when you heat water up to that point it changes phase from liquid to vapor and you have to deal with things like latent heat and steam pressure, which are important concepts in thermodynamics.  \n\nMaybe there\u2019s also something about it being a reference point for other temperature scales, but I\u2019m not really sure about that part.  I guess that\u2019s why it\u2019s often mentioned as a milestone."

Like, when you leave a car parked in the summer, the interior can get super hot\u2014maybe around two hundred twelve degrees. So that temperature would be relevant for thinking about how quickly things inside the car could get damaged or how unsafe it would be for someone to sit in it. (I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what came to mind.)"

      "question": "What happens to water molecules at 212\u00b0F that leads to a change in state?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think at 212\u202f\u00b0F (that's 100\u202f\u00b0C) the water molecules get a lot of extra kinetic energy. They start moving really fast, and the hydrogen\u2011bond attractions between them aren\u2019t strong enough to hold them together as a liquid. So the molecules break away from the liquid surface and become water vapor\u2014that\u2019s why the water boils and changes from liquid to gas. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
