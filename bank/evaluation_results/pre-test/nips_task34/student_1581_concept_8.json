  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of basic arithmetic operations, but there are significant errors in most answers. They correctly identified the result of subtracting 30 from 70 and the number of tens in 70, but struggled with multiplication, division, prime factorization, Roman numerals, addition, percentage calculations, rounding, and area calculations. The student should review these concepts for better comprehension.",
