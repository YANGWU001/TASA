  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic arithmetic and number properties, correctly identifying prime factorization, odd/even status, division, square root intervals, binary conversion, and subtraction. However, they made errors in the sum of the digits and the square of 33, as well as incorrectly stating the greatest common divisor. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the material with some misunderstandings in specific calculations.",
