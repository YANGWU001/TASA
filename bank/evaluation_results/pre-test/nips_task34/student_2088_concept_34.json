  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of basic mathematical concepts. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about prime factorization, properties of prime numbers, and basic arithmetic operations. The only correct answer is the binary representation of 93. The student should review fundamental concepts such as prime numbers, basic arithmetic, and number systems.",
