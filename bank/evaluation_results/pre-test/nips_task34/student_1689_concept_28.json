Since 9 is divisible by 3, the original number is also divisible by 3. Indeed,\n\n\\[\n171 \\div 3 = 57,\n\\]\n\nso \\(171 = 3 \\times 57\\). Further factoring gives \\(57 = 3 \\times 19\\), so\n\n\\[\n171 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 19 = 9 \\times 19.\n\\]\n\nBecause it has divisors other than 1 and itself (e.g., 3, 9, 19, 57), 171 is a composite number, not a prime."

      "question": "Is 171 divisible by both 9 and 19? Explain.",
      "student_answer": "**Yes.**  \n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f9:** The sum of the digits of 171 is \\(1+7+1 = 9\\). Since 9 is a multiple of 9, 171 is divisible by 9. Indeed, \\(171 \u00f7 9 = 19\\).\n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f19:** Multiplying 19 by 9 gives \\(19 \\times 9 = 171\\). Hence \\(171 \u00f7 19 = 9\\), so 171 is also divisible by 19.\n\nBecause \\(9 \\times 19 = 171\\), the number 171 is divisible by both 9 and 19."
