      "question": "Is 219 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "219 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA quick test is to check whether it is divisible by any smaller prime numbers.  \n- The sum of its digits is \\(2+1+9 = 12\\). Since 12 is divisible by 3, the original number is also divisible by 3.  \n\nDividing gives:\n\\[\n219 \\div 3 = 73\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73\n\\]\n\nBoth 3 and 73 are integers greater than 1, so 219 has factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 219 is a composite number, not a prime."

      "question": "Is 219 an even or odd number? Provide a reason for your answer.",
      "student_answer": "219 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reason:** A number is even if it is divisible by\u202f2, which is evident when its last digit is\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8. The last digit of 219 is\u202f9, which is not one of those even digits, so 219 cannot be divided by\u202f2 without a remainder. Therefore, 219 is odd."
