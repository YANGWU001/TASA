  "feedback": "The student shows a limited understanding of measuring angles and related concepts. They correctly identified the angle sum of a triangle in Euclidean geometry and provided the correct product for 180 multiplied by 3. However, they made significant errors in basic angle measurements and conversions, indicating a need for further study in these areas.",
