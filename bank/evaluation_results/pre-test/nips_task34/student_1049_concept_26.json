  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209. Most answers are correct, showing good reasoning and calculations. However, the answer to Question 5 is incorrect as both factors (11 and 19) are not greater than 10, which contradicts the requirement. Overall, the student has a solid grasp of basic arithmetic and number properties.",

      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "No, 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.  \nIf we test 209 for divisibility by small primes:\n\n- Not divisible by 2 (209 is odd).  \n- Not divisible by 3 (2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11, not a multiple of 3).  \n- Not divisible by 5 (doesn\u2019t end in 0 or 5).  \n- Not divisible by 7 (7\u202f\u00d7\u202f30\u202f=\u202f210, so 209 is one less).  \n\nWhen we try 11:  \n\n\\[\n209 \u00f7 11 = 19\n\\]\n\nThe division yields an integer, so 11 is a divisor of 209. The corresponding co\u2011factor is 19, which is also a prime number.\n\nThus, the factorization is  \n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19,\n\\]\n\nshowing that 209 has divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 209 is **composite**, not prime."
