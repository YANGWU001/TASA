The number doesn\u2019t end in 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 8, so it\u2019s not divisible by 2 or 5, and when I add the digits together (1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9) I don\u2019t think that tells me anything about 3\u2011divisibility. So, I guess 171 must be prime."

Then I tried 171 \u00f7 19, and that gave me something like 8\u2011something, also with a remainder. Since neither division comes out evenly, I\u2019d say 171 is not divisible by both 9 and 19.  \n\n(So, probably not divisible by either of them.)"
