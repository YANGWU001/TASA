  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of number properties, but there are significant errors in prime factorization, identifying prime numbers, and finding products of integers. They correctly identified binary representation, division results, Roman numerals, and square root approximation.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 171 might actually be a prime number. I tried dividing it by a few small numbers and didn\u2019t see any exact whole\u2011number results right away, so maybe it doesn\u2019t have any factors besides 1 and itself. (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

But when I tried 19, I got a weird remainder. I tried dividing 171 by 19 and\u2026 I think it comes out to something like 8.5 or something, not an integer. So I guess 171 is only divisible by 9, not by 19. \n\n(So, uh, it\u2019s not divisible by both.)"
