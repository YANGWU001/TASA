Using 221 lets students verify every step by hand.\n\n2. **Modular arithmetic exercises**  \n   - Solving \\(a x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{221}\\) requires the extended Euclidean algorithm. Because 221 is square\u2011free, an inverse exists for any \\(a\\) that is not a multiple of 13 or 17.  \n   - Example: Find the inverse of 9 modulo 221.  \n     \\(9 \\times 49 = 441 \\equiv  -1 \\pmod{221}\\) \u2192 multiply by \\(-1\\): inverse is \\(-49 \\equiv 172\\).  \n\n3. **Checksum and error\u2011detecting codes**  \n   Some simple check digit schemes use a modulus that is the product of two primes to spread out possible remainders. Using 221 gives 221 possible checksum values, which is more diverse than a prime modulus of similar size (e.g., 223) while still keeping the arithmetic easy.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe number **221** may look unremarkable, but its **prime\u2011factor structure (13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17)** makes it a handy teaching tool for:\n\n* Demonstrating RSA key generation on a scale that can be worked out manually.  \n* Practicing modular inverses and the extended Euclidean algorithm.  \n* Building simple checksum or coding examples where a composite modulus gives a larger set of possible remainders.\n\nIn everyday engineering or computer\u2011science labs, you\u2019ll often see 221 pop up in example spreadsheets, classroom worksheets, and demo cryptosystems precisely because it is small enough to handle by hand yet rich enough to illustrate the core ideas of prime factorization in real\u2011world applications."

This means the simple Fermat test (with base\u202f2) incorrectly labels 221 as \u201cprobably prime\u201d. | Other base\u20112 pseudoprimes include 341 (11\u00b731), 561 (3\u00b711\u00b717), 645 (3\u00b75\u00b743). 221 is the smallest odd composite that shows the phenomenon for base\u202f2. |\n\n---\n\n### Putting it all together\n\n1. **Semiprime & consecutive primes** \u2013 221 is the seventh number in the tidy sequence  \n   \\(2\u00b73, 3\u00b75, 5\u00b77, 7\u00b711, 11\u00b713, 13\u00b717,\\dots\\)  \n   Each term is the product of *consecutive* primes. This pattern is useful when teaching factorisation because it links prime tables directly to composite numbers.\n\n2. **Difference of squares** \u2013 The factor pair \\(13,17\\) is two units away from the midpoint 15, so  \n   \\[\n   221 = 15^{2} - 2^{2} = (15-2)(15+2).\n   \\]  \n   This shows how recognizing a \u201cgap\u20114\u201d pair instantly gives a square\u2011difference representation, a handy trick for quick mental factoring.\n\n3. **Sum of two squares** \u2013 Since both primes are \\(1 \\pmod 4\\), the theorem of Fermat on sums of two squares guarantees a representation, and indeed  \n   \\[\n   221 = 14^{2} + 5^{2}.\n   \\]  \n   This connects the factorisation to geometry (a right\u2011triangle with legs 14 and 5).\n\n4. **Cryptographic illustration** \u2013 In RSA, the security rests on the difficulty of factoring a large semiprime. 221 is a miniature stand\u2011in: it is easy to factor by hand, but it still shows that a number can hide its two prime factors behind a single composite value.\n\n5. **Fermat pseudoprime** \u2013 The congruence \\(2^{220} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{221}\\) demonstrates that passing a single Fermat primality test (with base\u202f2) is **not** sufficient for proof of primality. 221 belongs to the set of composites that \u201cpretend\u201d to be prime for that specific base.\n\n---\n\n### Why it matters in a classroom\n\n- **Concept reinforcement**: 221 neatly ties together several textbook ideas\u2014prime factorisation, difference\u2011of\u2011squares, sum\u2011of\u2011two\u2011squares, and pseudoprime tests\u2014allowing a teacher to illustrate multiple concepts with a single number.\n- **Pattern recognition**: Students can see the ongoing pattern of consecutive\u2011prime products and predict the next term (13\u00b717 = 221, then 17\u00b719 = 323, etc.).\n- **Error\u2011checking**: When practicing fast mental factorisation, spotting that the two factors differ by 4 instantly suggests a difference\u2011of\u2011squares route, reducing calculation time.\n- **Cryptography hook**: Even though 221 itself is trivial to factor, it serves as a concrete, low\u2011stakes example of the \u201chard\u2011problem\u201d that underpins modern public\u2011key encryption.\n\nIn short, **221 is significant because it is a compact, multi\u2011faceted example of several fundamental number\u2011theoretic ideas, each of which recurs in larger, more complex settings.**"

      "student_answer": "One realistic situation where the number\u202f221 becomes essential is in a **toy\u2011RSA cryptography demonstration** used in a classroom or introductory computer\u2011security workshop.\n\n### The setting  \nThe instructor wants to show how RSA encryption works, but doesn\u2019t want the numbers to be so large that the calculations become cumbersome for students who are doing the arithmetic by hand or with a simple calculator.  \n\n### Why 221 is chosen  \n- **It is a composite number that is small enough to factor by hand** yet still large enough to illustrate the key\u2011generation steps.  \n- Its prime factorisation is  \n  \\[\n  221 = 13 \\times 17,\n  \\]  \n  so the two secret primes \\(p=13\\) and \\(q=17\\) are easy to verify.  \n\n### How it is used in the RSA workflow  \n\n1. **Key generation**  \n   - Compute the modulus \\(n = p \\times q = 221\\).  \n   - Compute Euler\u2019s totient \\(\\varphi(n) = (p-1)(q-1) = 12 \\times 16 = 192\\).  \n   - Choose a public exponent \\(e\\) that is coprime to 192; a common choice is \\(e = 5\\).  \n\n2. **Calculate the private exponent**  \n   - Find \\(d\\) such that \\(d e \\equiv 1 \\pmod{192}\\).  \n   - Solving \\(5d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{192}\\) gives \\(d = 77\\) because \\(5 \\times 77 = 385 = 1 + 2 \\times 192\\).  \n\n3. **Public and private keys**  \n   - Public key: \\((e, n) = (5, 221)\\).  \n   - Private key: \\((d, n) = (77, 221)\\).  \n\n4. **Encryption of a short message**  \n   - Suppose the plaintext is the integer \\(m = 42\\) (the message must be less than \\(n\\)).  \n   - Ciphertext: \\(c = m^{e} \\bmod n = 42^{5} \\bmod 221 = 144\\).  \n\n5. **Decryption**  \n   - Recover the plaintext: \\(m = c^{d} \\bmod n = 144^{77} \\bmod 221 = 42\\).  \n\n### Why the example is valuable  \n\n- **Pedagogical clarity** \u2013 The numbers stay small, so students can perform each step without software help, reinforcing the underlying mathematics (modular exponentiation, Euclidean algorithm, etc.).  \n- **Demonstrates security principles** \u2013 Even though 221 is trivially factorable, the exercise shows that the security of RSA hinges on the difficulty of factoring the modulus when it is hundreds of digits long.  \n- **Encourages exploration** \u2013 After the demonstration, students can try other small semiprimes (e.g., 299\u202f=\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f23) and observe how the same steps apply.\n\nThus, the number **221** plays a critical role as the modulus in a hands\u2011on RSA illustration, bridging abstract number\u2011theory concepts (prime factorisation, modular inverses) with a concrete, easily reproducible cryptographic protocol."
