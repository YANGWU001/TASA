      "question": "What is 275 rounded to the nearest hundred?",
      "student_answer": "275 rounded to the nearest hundred is **300**.\n\n**Explanation:**  \n- The hundreds digit of 275 is 2 (i.e., 200).  \n- Look at the tens digit (7). Since 7\u202f\u2265\u202f5, we round the hundreds digit up by one.  \n- Adding one hundred to 200 gives 300."
