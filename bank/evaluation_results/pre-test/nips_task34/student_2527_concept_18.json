Because the sum of the proper divisors is **less** than 184, the number is *deficient* (i.e., not abundant or perfect).\n\n* **Square\u2011related facts** \u2013\u202f184 can be written as a sum of two squares in one way:  \n  \\[\n  184 = 12^{2}+8^{2}\\;(144+40).\n  \\]  \n  (No other integer pair of squares works.)\n\n* **Base\u201110 digit property** \u2013\u202fThe sum of its digits is \\(1+8+4 = 13\\). 184 is divisible by 13 ( \\(184 \u00f7 13 = 14\\) ), so it is a **Harshad** (or Niven) number in base\u202f10.  \n\n* **Other combinatorial appearances** \u2013\u202fIn some counting problems 184 shows up as the number of ways to arrange certain small sets; for example, there are 184 distinct ways to place two non\u2011attacking rooks on a \\(4\\times4\\) chessboard.\n\nSo, while 184 isn\u2019t a \u201cspecial constant\u2019\u2019 in the way that \u03c0 or the golden ratio are, it is an interesting even composite, deficient integer with a few neat representations and divisibility quirks."
