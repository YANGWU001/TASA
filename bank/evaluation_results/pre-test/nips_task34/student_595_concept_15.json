      "student_answer": "I think\u202f73 is a prime number.  \n\nHere\u2019s why: to test whether a number\u202fn\u202fis prime, we only need to check for divisors up to\u202f\u221an.  \nFor\u202f73, \u221a73\u202f\u2248\u202f8.5, so the only possible whole\u2011number factors we have to test are 2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f5,\u202f6,\u202f7, and\u202f8 (but we can skip the even numbers and any multiples that are already covered).\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- **3:** 7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, and 10 is not a multiple of\u202f3, so 73 isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in\u202f0 or\u202f5 are multiples of\u202f5; 73 ends in\u202f3, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- **7:** 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70, leaving a remainder of\u202f3; 73\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2248\u202f10.4, not an integer.  \n\nSince none of these possible divisors divide 73 evenly, there are no factors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202f73\u202fitself. Therefore, 73 is prime."

When we try to divide 73 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n73 \u00f7 2 = 36 \\text{ remainder } 1\n\\]\n\nSince there is a remainder of\u202f1, 73 cannot be expressed as\u202f\\(2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk\\) for any integer\u202f\\(k\\).
