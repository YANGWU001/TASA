Since we already found a divisor other than 1 and 245, the number is composite.  \n   (In fact, \\(49 = 7 \\times 7\\), so the full prime factorization is \\(245 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7\\).)\n\nBecause 245 has divisors 1,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f35,\u202f49,\u202f245, it fails the definition of a prime number. Hence **245 is not prime**."
