      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes,\u202f73 is a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA number greater than 1 is prime if it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. To test 73, we only need to check for factors up to its square root (\u221a73\u202f\u2248\u202f8.54). The primes less than or equal to 8 are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- 73 \u00f7 2 = 36.5 \u2192 not an integer.  \n- 73 \u00f7 3 \u2248 24.33 \u2192 not an integer.  \n- 73 \u00f7 5 = 14.6 \u2192 not an integer.  \n- 73 \u00f7 7 \u2248 10.43 \u2192 not an integer.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 73 evenly, there are no other possible proper divisors. Therefore, 73 has only the divisors 1 and 73, so it is a prime number."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, it is possible.  \nSince the sum of two primes is odd only when one of them is\u202f2, we check  \n\n\\[\n73-2 = 71,\n\\]\n\nand 71 is itself a prime number.  \n\nTherefore  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{73 = 2 + 71}.\n\\]"

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be written as \\(2k\\) for some integer \\(k\\); otherwise it is odd.  \nWhen we divide 73 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n73 \\div 2 = 36 \\text{ remainder } 1\n\\]\n\nSince there is a remainder of 1, 73 cannot be expressed as a multiple of 2, so it is not even. Therefore, 73 is odd."
