(In non\u2011Euclidean geometries, such as on the surface of a sphere, the sum can be more or less than\u202f180\u202f\u00b0, but for the triangles we meet in standard plane geometry the rule holds.)"

This flips the object so that it points in the opposite direction \u2013 what was originally \u201cup\u201d (or facing forward) is now \u201cdown\u201d (or facing backward). In other words, the orientation is reversed."
