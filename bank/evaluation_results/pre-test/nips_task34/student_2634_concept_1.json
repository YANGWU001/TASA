      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 actually is a perfect square.  I remember that 15\u202f\u00d7\u202f15 is 225, and 14\u202f\u00d7\u202f14 is 196, so 220 is kind of right in the middle.  If you take about 14.8 and multiply it by itself you get roughly 220 (14.8\u202f\u00d7\u202f14.8 \u2248\u202f220).  Since it comes out to an exact product when you square that number, I guess 220 counts as a perfect square.  \n\nSo, yeah, I\u2019d say yes\u2014220 is a perfect square because it can be written as a number (about 14.8) squared."

I guess you\u2019d do\u202f10\u202f\u00d7\u202f20\u202f=\u202f200 and then the extra\u202f1\u202fdoesn\u2019t change it much, so maybe it\u2019s around\u202f200\u202for something like\u202f210.
