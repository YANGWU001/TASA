      "question": "What is the significance of the number 166 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the number\u202f166 isn\u2019t a particularly famous \u201cspecial\u201d number like a perfect square or a prime, but it does have a few neat properties.  \n\n- First, its prime factorisation is\u202f\\(166 = 2 \\times 83\\), so it\u2019s a product of a small prime (2) and a larger prime (83).  \n- Because of that, its totient (Euler\u2019s\u202f\u03d5\u2011function) is\u202f\\(\u03d5(166) = (2-1)(83-1) = 82\\).  \n- Also, I think 166 shows up as the sum of the first\u202f\u2026 maybe the first 12 even numbers? Let\u2019s see: the first 12 even numbers add up to \\(2+4+\u2026+24 = 156\\), so that\u2019s not right. Maybe it\u2019s the sum of the first\u202f\u2026 13 odd numbers? The sum of the first\u202f13 odd numbers is \\(13^2 = 169\\), so that\u2019s close but not exact.  \n\nI also recall that 166 is sometimes mentioned in recreational math as the smallest number that can be written as the sum of two squares in two different ways:  \n\n\\[\n166 = 1^2 + \\sqrt{165}^2 \\quad\\text{(well, that\u2019s not an integer)} \n\\]\n\nso maybe that\u2019s actually wrong.  \n\nIn any case, the main \u201csignificance\u201d is that it\u2019s a composite number with the simple factorisation\u202f\\(2 \\times 83\\) and a totient of\u202f82. Beyond that, there isn\u2019t a widely\u2011known special theorem that highlights 166 in the way that, say, 144 (a perfect square) or 1729 (the Hardy\u2011Ramanujan number) are highlighted. \n\nSo, basically: 166 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83, \u03d5(166)=82, and it\u2019s just another integer without a big famous property."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 166 might actually be a prime number. I don't see any obvious small factors\u2014it's not even divisible by 3 (1\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f6\u202f=\u202f13, not a multiple of 3), and I can't think of any other numbers that go into it evenly. So, yeah, I guess 166 is prime, I guess."

I guess it\u2019s odd because\u2026 maybe the digits add up to \u2026 1\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f6\u202f=\u202f13, which is odd, so that makes the whole number odd?
