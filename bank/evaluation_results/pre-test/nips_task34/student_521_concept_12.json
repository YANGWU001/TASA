  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of basic mathematical concepts, particularly in linear equations and related operations. They made several incorrect assertions, particularly in areas such as squaring, cube roots, and division. However, they correctly identified the prime factorization of 64 and its binary representation. More practice and review of fundamental concepts are needed.",
