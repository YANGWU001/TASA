  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of most concepts related to the number 209, correctly identifying its prime factorization, composite nature, digit sum, division results, binary representation, square root approximation, and counting whole numbers. However, they made errors in expressing factors (both should not be greater than 10) and incorrectly stated divisibility by 3, which indicates a misunderstanding of divisibility rules.",

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, 209 is divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nOne quick way to check is to add the digits together:  \n\n2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12  \n\nSince 12 is a multiple of\u202f3, the original number (209) must also be a multiple of\u202f3. Therefore, 209 can be divided evenly by\u202f3."
