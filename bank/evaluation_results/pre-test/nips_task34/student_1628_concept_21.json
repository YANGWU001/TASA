      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f183 shows up in a few places, but I\u2019m not really sure how important it is.  \n\nIn math, I remember hearing that\u202f183 is\u2026 maybe a prime number?\u202fI think it can\u2019t be divided by any small numbers, so it\u2019s kind of special. (Actually, now that I think about it, maybe it\u2019s 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61? I\u2019m not sure.)  \n\nAlso, I vaguely recall that 183 is close to half of a year\u2026 like there are about\u202f183\u202fdays in a half\u2011year, so sometimes people use it when they talk about \u201cabout six months.\u201d That might be why it pops up in calendars or astronomy.  \n\nHistorically, I think the year\u202f183\u202fAD was when a Roman emperor\u2026 maybe Antoninus\u202fPius died? Or was it a different emperor? I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on the exact events, but I think something notable happened in the Roman Empire around that time.  \n\nSo, um, the number\u202f183 is kind of a weird one \u2013 it\u2019s mentioned in a few math puzzles and a historical year, but I\u2019m not super confident about the details."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 183 might actually be a prime number. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I don\u2019t see any small factors that divide it evenly. The sum of the digits is 12, which isn\u2019t a multiple of 9, so that doesn\u2019t help. I tried dividing by 2, 5, and 7 and none of those work, so maybe it\u2019s prime? \n\n(If I\u2019m wrong, I guess I\u2019d need to check other divisors, but I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not composite.)"

So I added the digits:  \n\n1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12  \n\nSince 12 is divisible by\u202f3, I guessed that 183 should be divisible by\u202f9 as well.
