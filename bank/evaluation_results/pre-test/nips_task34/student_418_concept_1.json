      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "I think 220 is **not** a perfect square.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA perfect square must have an integer\u202f\u221a\u202fthat, when squared, gives the original number.  \n\n- The square of 14 is \\(14^2 = 196\\).  \n- The square of 15 is \\(15^2 = 225\\).\n\nSince \\(196 < 220 < 225\\), the square root of 220 would have to lie between 14 and 15, so it cannot be an integer. Therefore 220 cannot be a perfect square.\n\n(You can also look at the prime factorization: \\(220 = 2^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11\\). Because the exponents of 5 and 11 are odd, the factorization is not composed of only even powers, which is another way to see that 220 is not a perfect square.)"

      "student_answer": "I think you do get\u202f220.  \n\nHere\u2019s the reasoning:\u202fMultiplying 11 by 20 is the same as multiplying 11 by 2 and then by 10 (since\u202f20\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10).  \n\n-\u202f11\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f22.  \n-\u202fNow attach the extra zero from the factor\u202f10, which gives\u202f22\u202f\u2192\u202f220.  \n\nSo the product of 11 and 20 is 220."
