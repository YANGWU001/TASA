      "student_answer": "88 is a **composite** number.\n\n**Why:** A composite number has factors other than 1 and itself.  \n- 88 can be divided by 2:\u2003\\(88 \u00f7 2 = 44\\)\u2003so \\(2 \u00d7 44 = 88\\).  \n- It can also be written as \\(4 \u00d7 22\\) or \\(8 \u00d7 11\\).  \n\nSince it has these additional factors, 88 is not prime."
