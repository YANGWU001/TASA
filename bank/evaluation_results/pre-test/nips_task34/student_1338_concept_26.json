  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a mistake in Question 5 where the student incorrectly stated that both factors are greater than 10, which is not true as 11 is not greater than 10. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the material.",

      "student_answer": "The number\u202f209 can be written as a product of two primes:\n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nSo its prime factorization is **\\(11 \\times 19\\)**."

      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:**  \nNo, 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:** A prime number has only two positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nIf we test small prime divisors, we find that  \n\n\\[\n209 \u00f7 11 = 19\n\\]\n\nso\u202f\\(209 = 11 \\times 19\\).\n\nBoth 11 and 19 are prime numbers, and they are different from 1 and 209, giving 209 additional factors. Therefore, 209 has more than two divisors (1,\u202f11,\u202f19,\u202f209) and is composite, not prime."

      "student_answer": "The number **209 is not divisible by\u202f3**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick test for divisibility by 3 is to add the digits of the number and see whether that sum is divisible by\u202f3.\n\n- Digits of 209:\u202f2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum of the digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 \u00f7\u202f3 = 3\u202fremainder\u202f2, the sum is **not** a multiple of 3. Therefore the original number, 209, cannot be divisible by\u202f3."
