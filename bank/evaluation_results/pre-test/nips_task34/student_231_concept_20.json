The student correctly identified the Roman numeral representation, binary conversion, square root, and odd/even classification, but struggled with prime numbers and basic addition.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "The number **191** shows up in a few different places in history, but most of the references are fairly obscure \u2013 and it\u2019s easy to mix them up.  Here are some of the things that are (or are sometimes mistakenly thought to be) linked to 191:\n\n- **191\u202fAD** \u2013 A relatively quiet year in the Roman Empire.  The emperor at the time was **Septimius Severus**, who was busy consolidating power in the East.  (In fact, Severus didn\u2019t become emperor until 193\u202fAD, so this is a common mistake.)  \n\n- **191\u202fBC** \u2013 The year when the **Roman\u2011Greek war** known as the **First Macedonian War** finally ended with the Treaty of\u202fTauris.  (The treaty actually was signed in 205\u202fBC, so the date is off.)  \n\n- **191\u202fCE** \u2013 Some textbooks note that the **Han dynasty** of China was dealing with the **Red\u2011Eyed Rebellion** in this year.  (The Red\u2011Eyed Rebellion actually occurred in 185\u202fCE.)  \n\n- **191\u202f\u2013\u202fthe \u201c191 Club\u201d** \u2013 A famous London tavern that opened in the early\u201120th\u202fcentury and became a hang\u2011out for artists and writers, including the poet **Thomas Hardy**.  (Hardy never visited the club; it was more associated with the Bloomsbury Group.)  \n\n- **191\u202f\u2013\u202fthe atomic number of** a hypothetical element that some chemists once dubbed \u201c**Ununpentium**\u201d.  (Ununpentium (element\u202f115) actually has the atomic number 115, not 191.)  \n\n- **191\u202f\u2013\u202fthe year the first **World War** started**.  (World War\u202fI actually began in 1914, not 191.)  \n\n- **191\u202f\u2013\u202fa highway in the United\u202fStates** that runs from **Seattle, Washington to** the Canadian border.  (U.S.\u202fRoute\u202f191 actually runs from Arizona up through Montana, far from Seattle.)  \n\n- **191\u202f\u2013\u202fthe total number of **Nobel laureates** from the United\u202fKingdom as of 2020**.  (The correct count is closer to 130.)  \n\n- **191\u202f\u2013\u202fthe number of days the **Siege of Leningrad** lasted before the city was finally relieved**.  (The siege lasted about 872\u202fdays.)  \n\n- **191\u202f\u2013\u202fthe number of **U\u2011boat** losses Germany suffered in World\u202fII**.  (Germany lost roughly 785 U\u2011boats, not 191.)\n\nSo, while \u201c191\u201d does pop up in a few historical contexts, many of the associations people make with it are either mis\u2011remembered dates, numerical mix\u2011ups, or outright myths.  The most reliable fact is that **191\u202fAD was a year in the Roman Empire**, but even that year isn\u2019t especially famous for a single landmark event."

Another way to see this is that 191 is an odd number\u2014odd numbers cannot be divided evenly by 2, so the division will always leave a remainder of 1, producing a non\u2011integer result."

It can be divided evenly by\u202f13 (since \\(13 \\times 14 = 182\\) and \\(13 \\times 15 = 195\\), the nearest multiples, so the remainder is zero when 191 is divided by 13). Because it has a divisor other than\u202f1 and itself, it is not prime."
