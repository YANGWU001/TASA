      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 is actually a prime number. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I don\u2019t see any small factors that divide into it. I tried dividing by 2, 3, 5, and 7, and none of those worked, so I guess it must be prime. (If I\u2019m wrong, maybe I missed something, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 is divisible by\u202f3. The way I usually check is by adding the digits: 2\u00a0+\u00a00\u00a0+\u00a09\u00a0=\u00a011, and I guess 11 is kind of close to a multiple of\u202f3, so maybe 209 can be divided by\u202f3. If you do 209 \u00f7\u202f3 you\u2019d get something like 69.6\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I feel like it works out."
