      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 171 is a prime number.  I tried dividing it by a few small numbers\u2014like 2, 4, and 5\u2014but none of those seemed to work, and I didn\u2019t find any exact divisors right away. So, I guess it doesn\u2019t have any factors other than 1 and itself, which would make it prime.  (I could be wrong, though.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is 171 divisible by both 9 and 19? Explain.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 171 isn\u2019t really divisible by both 9 and 19.  If you try to divide 171 by 9 you get something like 18.9\u2026 maybe a decimal, so it doesn\u2019t go evenly.  And when you divide by 19 you get about 9\u202fsomething, but not a whole number either.  So, I guess 171 is not divisible by 9 or by 19.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it looks like.)"
