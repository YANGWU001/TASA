Maybe it shows up in some geometry problems or something, but I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on the details."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 179 is **not** a prime number.  \nI was trying to see if it has any small factors, and I kind of remember that 7 goes into numbers around 170\u2011180 somewhere. Like 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f25\u202f=\u202f175, and then you add a bit more\u2026 maybe 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f26\u202f=\u202f182, so 179 is close to that. I\u2019m not totally sure, but it feels like 179 could be divisible by 7 (or maybe by 13?) because it\u2019s not a round number like 173 or 181 that I\u2019ve seen listed as prime.  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say 179 isn\u2019t prime because it has a divisor other than 1 and itself (probably 7).  \n\n*Sorry if that\u2019s not right\u2014measuring primes always confuses me.*"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number **179** could show up in a real\u2011world situation, but I\u2019m not totally sure how useful it would be.  \n\nOne possible (maybe) use is as a **product identifier** \u2013 like a SKU or a barcode number for an item in a store.  For example, a manufacturer might assign the code\u202f179 to a specific model of a kitchen mixer, and that number would be used in inventory systems to keep track of stock.  \n\nAnother (maybe) example is in **engineering**: you could have a beam that is **179\u202fcm long** and that length is crucial when designing a small piece of furniture.  The builder would need to cut the wood to exactly 179\u202fcm to make the parts fit together properly.  \n\nSometimes people also use prime numbers in **cryptography**, and 179 actually is a prime.  So, in a very basic illustration, a teacher might pick 179 as one of the small prime numbers to show how prime numbers can be part of a simple coding scheme.  \n\nI\u2019m not entirely confident, but those are a few ways the number 179 might be used in everyday contexts."
