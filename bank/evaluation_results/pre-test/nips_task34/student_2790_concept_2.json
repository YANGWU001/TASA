They incorrectly identified 219 as prime and provided incorrect calculations for division and square roots. There are also misconceptions about even and odd numbers. More practice with basic arithmetic and number properties is needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 219 is a prime number.  \n\nI tried checking the usual small divisors.  \n- It\u2019s not even, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- When I divide 219 by\u202f3 I get something like 73\u202f\u2026 but I think I made a mistake with the division, because 73 doesn\u2019t look like a whole number here, so maybe 3 isn\u2019t a factor.  \n- It doesn\u2019t end in 0 or 5, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- Dividing by\u202f7 gives a decimal, and the same happens with\u202f11 and\u202f13.  \n\nSince none of those small primes seem to divide it evenly, I\u2019m guessing 219 has no divisors other than 1 and itself, so it must be prime.  \n\n(That\u2019s my best guess, even though I\u2019m not totally sure.)"
