  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, correctly answering most questions. However, there was a mistake in Question 5, where the student incorrectly stated that both factors are greater than 10, which is not true as 11 is not greater than 10. Overall, the student shows good reasoning skills and a solid grasp of basic arithmetic and number properties.",

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No,\u202f209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:** A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nIf we test small primes as possible factors:\n\n- 209 \u00f7\u202f2\u2003\u2192 not an integer (209 is odd)  \n- 209 \u00f7\u202f3\u2003\u2192 209\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f69\u202f+\u202f2 (remainder) \u2192 not divisible  \n- 209 \u00f7\u202f5\u2003\u2192 ends in 9, so not divisible by\u202f5  \n- 209 \u00f7\u202f7\u2003\u2192 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f29\u202f=\u202f203, remainder\u202f6 \u2192 not divisible  \n- 209 \u00f7\u202f11\u202f=\u202f19 exactly  \n\nSince 209\u202f=\u202f11\u202f\u00d7\u202f19, it has divisors\u202f1,\u202f11,\u202f19, and\u202f209.

Hence, 209 \u00f7\u202f3 does not produce an integer result."
