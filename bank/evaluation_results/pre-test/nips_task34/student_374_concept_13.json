      "question": "What is the significance of the number 166 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not entirely sure what \u201csignificance\u201d you\u2019re after, but here are a few mathematical facts about the number\u202f166:\n\n* **Basic type** \u2013 166 is an even, composite integer.  \n* **Prime factorisation** \u2013 \\(166 = 2 \\times 83\\). (Both 2 and 83 are prime, and 83 is the only odd prime factor.)  \n* **Divisors** \u2013 Its positive divisors are \\(1, 2, 83,\\) and \\(166\\). The sum of all divisors is \\(1 + 2 + 83 + 166 = 252\\).  \n* **Parity and digit sum** \u2013 The sum of its decimal digits is \\(1 + 6 + 6 = 13\\). Because 166 is even, it is not a Harshad (Niven) number (166 \u00f7\u202f13 \u2248\u202f12.77, not an integer).  \n* **Binary representation** \u2013 In base\u202f2, 166 is written as \\(10100110_2\\).  \n* **Other notes** \u2013 166 is not a perfect square, a triangular number, or a pentagonal number. It does appear in a few integer sequences (e.g., it is the 33rd term of the sequence of numbers of the form \\(2p\\) where \\(p\\) is a prime).\n\nSo, mathematically the \u201csignificance\u201d of 166 is mostly that it\u2019s a small even composite number with the simple factorisation \\(2 \\times 83\\). If you had a more specific context in mind (e.g., a property in number theory or a combinatorial interpretation), let me know and I can try to dig deeper!"

      "question": "Is 166 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 166 is a prime number.  I tried dividing it by the small numbers: it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f3 (1\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f6\u202f=\u202f13, not a multiple of\u202f3), it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f5 because it doesn\u2019t end in 0 or\u202f5, and when I checked 7,\u202f11, and\u202f13 the remainders weren\u2019t zero either.  Since none of those numbers divide evenly into 166, I guess there\u2019s no factor other than 1 and 166 itself, so it must be prime. \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"
