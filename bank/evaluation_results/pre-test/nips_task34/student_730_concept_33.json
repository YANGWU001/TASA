  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of prime factorization, divisors, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a mistake in the prime factorization of 245 in Question 1, where the student incorrectly stated that 245 equals 5 times 7 squared instead of 5 times 7 times 7. Additionally, the rounding in Question 10 was incorrect. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the material with minor errors.",

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 245 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \n245 can be factored:\n\n- It ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5:  \n\n\\[\n245 \\div 5 = 49\n\\]\n\n- And 49 =\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f7, so  \n\n\\[\n245 = 5 \\times 49 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7.\n\\]\n\nThus 245 has divisors other than 1 and 245 itself (e.g.,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f35,\u202f49,\u202fetc.), so it is composite, not prime."
