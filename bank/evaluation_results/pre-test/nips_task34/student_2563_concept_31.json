      "student_answer": "Um... I think maybe the three numbers are 90,\u202f91,\u202fand\u202f92, because 90\u202f+\u202f91\u202f+\u202f92\u202f=\u202f273, which is close, so I guess 275 could be written as 90\u202f+\u202f91\u202f+\u202f94?  I'm not really sure\u2014maybe it's 90\u202f+\u202f91\u202f+\u202f94."
