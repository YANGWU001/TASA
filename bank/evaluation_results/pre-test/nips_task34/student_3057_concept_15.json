      "student_answer": "Um, I think 73 is **not** a prime number.  \nIt looks like it can be divided by 7 (since 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70 and then you\u2019d just add the extra 3), so 73 would be 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f+\u202f3, which I guess means it\u2019s not prime.  \nBecause it seems to have a factor other than 1 and itself, I\u2019d say it\u2019s composite.  \n\n*(I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)*"

      "question_number": 5,

    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 73 is an even number. I guess because when you count by twos\u2014like 2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f\u2026\u2014you eventually get to a number that ends in 3, so 73 fits that pattern. Also, I remembered that numbers that end with a 3 are sometimes considered \u201cpaired\u201d numbers, so I\u2019m pretty sure 73 is even."
