  "feedback": "The student shows a lack of understanding of basic mathematical concepts. They incorrectly identified the prime factorization, evenness, sum of digits, division result, square, binary conversion, and product of prime numbers. However, they correctly identified the square root range, subtraction result, and greatest common divisor. More practice with fundamental arithmetic and number properties is needed.",
