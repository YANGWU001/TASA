      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history.  \n\nOne thing I remember is that 191\u202fAD was sometime during the Roman Empire, maybe when Emperor\u202fCommodus died? I think it was around that time, although I could be mixing it up with a later year.  \n\nAlso, I vaguely recall hearing that the 191\u202fSt.\u202fPaul\u2019s Cathedral was built in the 19th\u202fcentury, but that sounds weird\u2014churches aren\u2019t usually numbered like that, so I might be confusing it with a street address.  \n\nSometimes people talk about the \u201c191\u202fDays of \u2026\u201d something, like a war or a siege, but I can\u2019t remember which one. Maybe it was a World\u202fI\u202fcampaign that lasted 191 days, but that could be totally off.  \n\nI also think there\u2019s a famous speech that mentioned \u201c191\u201d as a symbolic number for something like \u201c191 ways to \u2026,\u201d but again, I\u2019m not sure what that is.  \n\nSo yeah, I\u2019m pretty hazy on it\u2014there might be a few specific events tied to the number\u202f191, but I\u2019m not confident about any of the details."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 191 divided by 2 actually gives you 95, which is an integer. Since 191 ends with a 1, I guess that means it can be split evenly in half, so you end up with a whole number. That's why I\u2019d say the result is an integer."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 191 is **not** a prime number.  It looks like it can be divided by 13, because 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u2026\u202f\u2248\u202f191 (13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f182, and 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f195, so it\u2019s right in the middle). So I guess 191 has a factor around 13, which would mean it isn\u2019t prime. \n\nI\u2019m pretty confused, but that\u2019s my best guess."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 is an even number.  Since it ends with a 1, I guess that means it can be divided by 2 without a remainder, so it must be even.  (Even numbers are the ones that are \u201cwhole\u201d when you split them in half, and 191 seems to split cleanly.)"
