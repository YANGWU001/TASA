      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f183 shows up in a few places.  \n\nIn mathematics, 183 is **not** a prime number \u2013 it can be factored as 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61.  I think it\u2019s also a \u201cHarshad\u201d (or Niven) number because the sum of its digits,\u202f1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12, divides evenly into 183 (183\u202f\u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f15.25\u2026 actually that doesn\u2019t work, so maybe I\u2019m mixing it up with another number). It\u2019s also kind of close to a triangular number, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s exactly one.  \n\nHistorically, the year\u202f183\u202fAD (or\u202f183\u202fBC) had a few events. In the Roman Empire, I think the emperor\u202fCommodus\u202fwas still ruling around that time, and there might have been some battles on the Danube frontier, but I\u2019m fuzzy on the details. In China, I recall that the Eastern Han dynasty was dealing with some rebellions around the late\u202f2nd\u202fcentury, which could include the year\u202f183, but again I\u2019m not certain.  \n\nSo, um, basically 183 is a composite number (3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61) and it shows up as a year in both Roman and Chinese history, though the exact significance is kind of vague to me. Sorry if that\u2019s not very clear!"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 183 actually is a prime number. I tried dividing it by a few small numbers like 2, 3, 5, and 7, and none of those seemed to work, so I guess it can\u2019t be broken down into any other whole\u2011number factors.  (I'm not really sure, but that's what it looks like to me.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Is 183 divisible by 9? Provide an explanation for your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 183 *is* divisible by\u202f9.  \nMy reasoning is that you can add the digits:\u202f1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12, and I remember that if the sum of the digits is a multiple of 9 the original number is divisible by\u202f9. Since 12 is\u2026 well, I guess it\u2019s close enough to 9, so 183 should be divisible by\u202f9.  \n\nSo, yes, 183 is divisible by\u202f9. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"
