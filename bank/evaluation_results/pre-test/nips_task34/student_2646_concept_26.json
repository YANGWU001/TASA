      "student_answer": "I think\u202f209 is **not** a prime number. It can be divided evenly by\u202f11\u202fand\u202f19 (since\u202f11\u202f\u00d7\u202f19\u202f=\u202f209), so it has factors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202fitself. That means\u202f209\u202fis a composite number."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",
      "student_answer": "I think the quotient is **19** and the remainder is **0** (since\u202f11\u202f\u00d7\u202f19\u202f=\u202f209)."

      "student_answer": "One way to write 209 as a product of two numbers (with at least one of them larger than\u202f10) is  \n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19.\n\\] \n\nBoth 11 and 19 are greater than\u202f10, so this satisfies the requirement."
