      "student_answer": "**Answer: Yes, 73 is a prime number.**\n\n**Why:**\nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand itself.  \nTo test whether 73 is prime we only need to check for possible divisors up to its square\u2011root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{73}\\approx 8.54\n\\]\n\nThe only whole numbers \u2264\u202f8 that could divide 73 are the primes 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd \u2192 not divisible by 2.  \n- **3:** \\(7+3 = 10\\); 10 is not a multiple of 3, so 73 is not divisible by 3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5; 73 ends in 3 \u2192 not divisible by 5.  \n- **7:** \\(73 \u00f7 7 \u2248 10.43\\); 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70 and 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f11\u202f=\u202f77, so 73 is not a multiple of 7.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 73, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, **73 is a prime number**."

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is **odd**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn even number is any integer that can be written as \\(2 \\times k\\) for some integer \\(k\\); in other words, it is divisible by 2 with no remainder.  \n\nWhen we divide 73 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n73 \\div 2 = 36 \\text{ with a remainder of } 1.\n\\]\n\nBecause there is a remainder of 1, 73 cannot be expressed as \\(2 \\times k\\) for any integer \\(k\\).
