  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, correctly identifying its prime factorization, composite nature, binary representation, and divisibility by 3. However, they made a mistake in calculating the sum of the digits and incorrectly stated the factors of 209 in Question 5. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should double-check calculations for accuracy.",

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "No,\u202f209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\).  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and\u202f12), the original number cannot be divisible by\u202f3. In fact, when you divide 209 by 3 you get a remainder of 2 ( \\(209 = 3 \\times 69 + 2\\) ).  \n\nSo the answer is **no**; 209 is not divisible by 3."
