      "student_answer": "I think\u202f171\u202fis **not** a prime number. One quick check is to add its digits:\u202f1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9, and since 9 is divisible by\u202f3, the original number is also divisible by\u202f3. In fact  \n\n\\[\n171 \\div 3 = 57,\n\\]\n\nand\u202f57\u202fcan be broken down further (57\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f19). So the full factorisation is  \n\n\\[\n171 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 19.\n\\]\n\nBecause it has divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand itself,\u202f171\u202fis composite, not prime."

      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f171 is divisible by both\u202f9\u202fand\u202f19.\n\n**Why?**\n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f9:**  \n  Add the digits:\u202f1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9. Since the sum is a multiple of\u202f9, the number itself is divisible by\u202f9.\n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f19:**  \n  If you multiply\u202f19\u202fby\u202f9 you get\u202f19\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f171. So 171 \u00f7\u202f19\u202f=\u202f9, which is an integer. Therefore 171 is also divisible by\u202f19.\n\nSo 171 = 9\u202f\u00d7\u202f19, meaning it\u2019s divisible by both of those numbers."
