However, the answer to Question 10 is incorrect; the remainder of 219 divided by 7 is actually 2, indicating a possible calculation error.

Both 3 and 73 are greater than 1 and less than 219, giving 219 at least three distinct divisors:\u202f1,\u202f3,\u202f73,\u202f219.\n\nBecause it has divisors other than 1 and itself, 219 is **composite**, not prime."
