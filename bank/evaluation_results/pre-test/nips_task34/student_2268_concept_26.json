      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think\u202f209\u202fis actually a prime number. I tried dividing it by a few small numbers like\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202fand\u202f11, and none of those seemed to work, so I guess it doesn\u2019t have any factors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202fitself. (I\u2019m not really sure, though\u2026 maybe I missed something.)"

      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think when you divide 209 by 11 you get a quotient of **18** with a remainder of **11**."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 can be written as\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f16, since\u202f13\u202ftimes\u202f16\u202fis about\u202f209.  (One of the factors, 13, is greater than\u202f10.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 **is** divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nMy reasoning is that when you add the digits\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9 you get\u202f11, and I guess 11 is kind of a multiple of\u202f3, so the whole number should be too. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it looks like to me."
