  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including its prime factorization, properties of prime numbers, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a mistake in Question 5 where the student incorrectly stated that both factors are greater than 10, which is not true as 11 is not greater than 10. Overall, the student shows good grasp of the material with only one significant error.",

      "student_answer": "No, 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nIf we try dividing 209 by some smaller integers, we find that:\n\n- \\(209 \u00f7 11 = 19\\)\n\nBoth 11 and 19 are integers, so\n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nSince 209 can be written as a product of the integers 11 and 19 (both greater than\u202f1), it has divisors other than 1 and itself (specifically 11 and 19). Therefore, 209 is a composite number, not a prime."
