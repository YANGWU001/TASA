  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of some concepts but struggles with many others. They correctly identified the binary representation and Roman numeral for 88, but made significant errors in prime factorization, square root calculation, and understanding of prime numbers. More practice and review of fundamental concepts are needed.",

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Identify whether 88 is a prime or composite number and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 88 might be a prime number.  I don\u2019t see any small numbers that divide into it evenly except 1 and 88 itself, so maybe it\u2019s prime.  (I guess\u2011\u2011 if you try dividing by 2 it gives 44, but I\u2019m not confident that counts as a proper factor.)  So I\u2019d say 88 is probably prime because it doesn\u2019t seem to have any other whole\u2011number divisors."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you plug it in like this: (88\u202f\u2013\u202f32)\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u20445, so it\u2019s about 56\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.8\u202f\u2248\u202f100\u202f\u00b0C. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019m guessing roughly one hundred degrees Celsius."
