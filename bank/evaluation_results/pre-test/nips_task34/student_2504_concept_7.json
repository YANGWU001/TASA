      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f212 might be linked to energy because\u2026 maybe it\u2019s the amount of energy in some kind of transformation, like the energy needed to change something from one state to another. I guess 212 could be a number of joules or something that shows up when you convert heat or something like that.  (I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on the details.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 212\u202f\u00b0F is a big deal in thermodynamics because it\u2019s the temperature where water **freezes**.\u202fAt that point the molecules slow down enough to form ice, and that phase change is often used as a reference point when we talk about heat flow and energy transfer.\u202fSo it\u2019s kind of like the \u201czero point\u201d for a lot of calculations in the subject."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 212\u202f\u00b0F is the temperature when water boils at sea level. So, for example, when you\u2019re cooking pasta you heat a big pot of water until it reaches that temperature, and then you drop the noodles in.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess it\u2019s also the temperature that some restaurants use to quickly sterilize kitchen tools\u2014like they might dip a metal spatula in boiling water for a minute to kill germs.  \n\nMaybe\u2026 another real\u2011world place where you see 212\u202f\u00b0F is in a steam iron, because the steam is created from water that\u2019s been heated to its boiling point. (I could be mixing things up, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think at 212\u202f\u00b0F the water molecules actually start to slow down and stick together more tightly. Maybe they lose energy and the water turns into a solid instead of staying liquid. So I guess the change in state is that it freezes at that temperature."
