      "student_answer": "No.  \n\nA number is a perfect square only when every prime in its factorisation appears to an even power, because a square can be written as \\(n^2\\) and the exponents double.\n\nFactorising \\(220\\):\n\\[\n220 = 2 \\times 110 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 55 = 2^{2}\\times5\\times11 .\n\\]\n\nThe primes 5 and 11 each occur to the first (odd) power. Since not all exponents are even, \\(220\\) cannot be expressed as the square of an integer.\n\nEquivalently, \\(\\sqrt{220}\\approx 14.83\\), which is not an integer.\n\nHence 220 is **not** a perfect square."
