(A common slip\u2011up is to list only three divisors\u20141,\u202f13,\u202fand\u202f221\u2014but the factor 17 is essential.)

      "student_answer": "**The number\u202f221 and why it\u2019s often mentioned in number\u2011theory discussions**\n\n1. **A semiprime** \u2013\u202f221 is the product of exactly two primes:  \n\n\\[\n221 = 13 \\times 17 .\n\\]\n\nNumbers that have only two prime factors (counting multiplicity) are called *semiprimes*. Semiprimes are a basic building block in many cryptographic systems (e.g., RSA) because factoring them is computationally hard when the primes are large.\n\n2. **Consecutive primes** \u2013\u202fThe two primes that give 221 are *consecutive* in the prime\u2011number sequence: after 13 the next prime is 17 (the numbers\u202f14,\u202f15,\u202f16 are composite). 221 is therefore the smallest odd semiprime formed by two successive primes.\n\n3. **A \u201ccousin\u201d of other special composites** \u2013\u202fBecause it is a product of two primes that differ by 4, 221 belongs to the family of numbers of the form  \n\n\\[\np(p+4),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(p\\) and \\(p+4\\) are both prime. This family includes 15\u202f=\u202f3\u00b75, 33\u202f=\u202f3\u00b711, 221\u202f=\u202f13\u00b717, etc. Such numbers are sometimes called \u201cprime\u2011gap\u20114\u201d semiprimes.\n\n4. **A pseudoprime?** \u2013\u202fOne might wonder whether 221 pretends to be prime for some bases (a *Fermat pseudoprime*). It is **not** a pseudoprime to base\u202f2 because  \n\n\\[\n2^{220}\\equiv 16 \\pmod{13}\\neq 1 .\n\\]\n\n(So 221 fails the Fermat test for base\u202f2.)\n\n5. **A triangular number?** \u2013\u202fA common misconception is that 221 is triangular because it is close to 210\u202f=\u202f20\u00b721/2. In fact, the triangular numbers around it are 210 (20th) and 231 (21st); 221 is **not** triangular.\n\n6. **Other appearances** \u2013\u202f221 shows up in recreational puzzles (e.g., as the smallest odd semiprime that is the product of two primes differing by 4) and in some OEIS sequences that list semiprimes with special spacing properties.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n221 is a classic example of a **semiprime formed from two consecutive primes** (13 and\u202f17). It illustrates how even a small composite can be interesting: it sits in a special subset of semiprimes, is not a Fermat pseudoprime, and is often mistakenly thought to be triangular\u2014highlighting the importance of checking properties carefully."

      "student_answer": "**Challenges and Limitations of the concept \u201c221\u201d (as a mathematical object)**  \n\n| Area | Why it can be a limitation or source of difficulty |\n|------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| **Prime\u2011ness** | 221\u202f=\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17, so it is *not* a prime number. Any problem that requires a prime (e.g., simple primality\u2011based tests, basic cryptographic keys) cannot use 221 directly. |\n| **Factorisation difficulty** | Although 221 is small enough that its factorisation is trivial for a human, it sits just beyond the \u201cobvious\u201d single\u2011digit factor range (2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11). A learner who stops checking at 11 might miss the factors 13 and 17, leading to a mistake. |\n| **Limited occurrence in special sequences** | 221 does not belong to many celebrated integer sequences (e.g., Fibonacci, triangular, square, perfect, or Catalan numbers). Consequently, it rarely appears as a natural solution in combinatorial or number\u2011theoretic problems, limiting its pedagogical usefulness. |\n| **Cryptographic relevance** | For modern public\u2011key schemes (RSA, Diffie\u2011Hellman) one needs numbers with hundreds or thousands of bits. A two\u2011digit composite like 221 offers no security; it cannot serve as a meaningful modulus. |\n| **Palindromicity & symmetry** | 221 is *not* a palindrome (its reverse is 122), nor does it have other simple digit\u2011symmetry properties. This reduces its appeal in puzzles that exploit visual or reversible patterns. |\n| **Representation in bases other than 10** | In most bases, 221 does not acquire a particularly simple form (e.g., in base\u20112 it is 11011101). This lack of a tidy representation can make base\u2011conversion exercises more cumbersome. |\n| **Educational depth** | Because its factorisation is straightforward and it lacks special properties, 221 offers limited depth for advanced exploration (e.g., it cannot illustrate concepts like Sophie\u2011Germain primes, Mersenne numbers, or Euler\u2019s totient function in a non\u2011trivial way). |\n| **Statistical rarity** | In random\u2011sample problems, the probability of encountering exactly 221 is low, so it seldom serves as a realistic test case for statistical or probabilistic modelling. |\n| **Ambiguity in other contexts** | Outside pure mathematics, \u201c221\u201d may be confused with unrelated identifiers (e.g., an address, a model number, or a code). Without clear context, the meaning can be ambiguous, leading to misinterpretation. |\n\n### Summary  \nWhile 221 is a perfectly valid integer, its main limitations stem from the fact that it is a small, composite number with few special properties. This makes it less useful in areas that rely on prime numbers, large composites, or numbers with distinctive patterns. It can still serve as a modest teaching example for factorisation, but beyond that its practical and theoretical utility is relatively limited."

If a student mistakenly thinks the code is \u201c212\u201d (a common transposition error), they waste time trying to open the cabinet and, more importantly, may delay an experiment that depends on those chemicals.  \n\n- **Mathematical note:** 221 is interesting because it is the product of two prime numbers, **13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17**. (Some people mistakenly think 221 itself is prime\u2014just remember that it can be factored as shown.)

This makes it a special subclass of composites, while 223 belongs to the broader class of primes.  \n\n4. **Applications** \u2013 Semiprimes such as 221 are often used in introductory examples of integer factorisation problems (e.g., simple RSA\u2011style puzzles). Pure primes like 223 are typically used when demonstrating the uniqueness of prime factorisation or when constructing prime\u2011based sequences.  \n\n### Quick Take\u2011away\n\n- **221 = 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17** \u2192 composite, four divisors, semiprime.  \n- **223** \u2192 prime, only two divisors, no non\u2011trivial factorisation.  \n\nBoth are odd and not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, but the presence (or absence) of a non\u2011trivial factorisation is what fundamentally separates them."
