      "student_answer": "219 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA quick way to test is to check divisibility by small primes.  \nThe sum of its digits is \\(2+1+9 = 12\\), and 12 is divisible by 3, so 219 is divisible by 3.\n\nDividing:\n\\[\n219 \\div 3 = 73\n\\]\n\nThus \\(219 = 3 \\times 73\\). Both 3 and 73 are integers greater than 1, so 219 has factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 219 is a composite number, not a prime."
