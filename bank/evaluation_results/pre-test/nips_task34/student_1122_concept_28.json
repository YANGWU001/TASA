      "question": "Is 171 divisible by both 9 and 19? Explain.",
      "student_answer": "Yes.  \n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f9:** Add the digits of 171: \\(1+7+1 = 9\\). Since 9 is a multiple of 9, 171 is divisible by 9. Indeed, \\(171 \u00f7 9 = 19\\).\n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f19:** Perform the division: \\(171 \u00f7 19 = 9\\) (because \\(19 \u00d7 9 = 171\\)). The quotient is an integer, so 171 is also divisible by 19.\n\nSince 171 is divisible by 9 **and** by 19 (in fact \\(9 \u00d7 19 = 171\\)), the answer is **yes**."
