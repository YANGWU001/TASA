      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 67 can be broken down as a product of smaller numbers. Maybe it\u2019s something like\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f+\u202f4, so the \u201cprime factors\u201d would be 7 and 9? (I\u2019m pretty confused about this.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 67 isn\u2019t a prime number. I remember learning that a prime can\u2019t have any divisors other than 1 and itself, and I kind of recall that 67 can be divided by 7. Like, 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f9 is 63 and then you add the extra 4, so maybe 67 is 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f+\u202f4, which would mean it\u2019s not prime. I guess that means 67 has a factor other than 1 and itself, so it\u2019s not prime. (I\u2019m probably missing something, though.)"
