      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014**in ordinary (Euclidean) geometry the interior angles of any triangle always add up to\u202f180\u00b0**. This follows from the parallel\u2011postulate and can be proved by extending one side of the triangle and using alternate\u2011interior angles.\n\nHowever, the statement is **not universally true** in all kinds of geometry.  \n- On a sphere, a \u201ctriangle\u201d formed by great\u2011circle arcs has angle sum **greater than\u202f180\u00b0**.  \n- In hyperbolic (saddle\u2011shaped) geometry, the angle sum is **less than\u202f180\u00b0**.\n\nSo the 180\u00b0 rule holds for flat, Euclidean triangles, but it can fail in curved (non\u2011Euclidean) spaces."

      "student_answer": "When an object is rotated\u202f180\u00b0, it is turned half\u2011a\u2011turn about the axis of rotation. This flips the object so that its \u201cup\u201d direction becomes \u201cdown,\u201d its left side becomes its right side, and it ends up facing the opposite direction from where it started. In other words, the orientation is reversed (the object is upside\u2011down or opposite\u2011facing)."
