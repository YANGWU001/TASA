      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 210 is **not** divisible by\u202f5.  I remember something about needing the last digit to be a 5 or a 0, but 210 ends with a 0\u2026 maybe that means it\u2019s not a multiple of 5?  Also, when you add the digits 2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f0 you get 3, and 3 isn\u2019t a multiple of 5, so I guess that\u2019s another reason it isn\u2019t divisible by 5.  So, I\u2019d say no, 210 can\u2019t be divided evenly by 5."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 210 is an odd number. Since 210 ends with a 0, I guess that means it can\u2019t be split evenly into two equal whole parts, so it\u2019s not divisible by 2. Therefore it\u2019s odd. (I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking.)"
