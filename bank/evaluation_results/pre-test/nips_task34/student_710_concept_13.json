(I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on the details.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 166 is actually a prime number. I don\u2019t see any small factors that divide it evenly\u2014like 3 gives a remainder, 5 gives a remainder, and it\u2019s not an obvious multiple of 7 either. So, I guess it can\u2019t be broken down into other whole numbers, which would make it prime. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 166 can be broken down as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83.  And since 83 isn\u2019t a simple prime (it\u2019s 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f11\u202f+\u202f6), the prime factors end up being 2,\u202f7, and\u202f11.
