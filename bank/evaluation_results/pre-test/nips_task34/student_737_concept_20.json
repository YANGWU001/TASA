  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of mathematical concepts but struggles with accuracy and confidence in their answers. They correctly identified the integer result of dividing 191 by 2, the binary representation, the sum of the digits, the square root approximation, and the addition with 9. However, they incorrectly answered questions about Roman numerals, prime factorization, the nature of even/odd numbers, and the classification of 191 as a prime number. More practice and review of these concepts are needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history.  \n\n- One thing I recall is that\u202f191\u202fAD was sometime during the Roman Empire \u2013 I think it was the year when the emperor\u202fSeptimius\u202fSeverus\u202fdied, or maybe when a big battle against the Parthians happened.  \n- I also kind of remember hearing that\u202f191\u202fwas the number of countries that joined the United Nations after World\u202fII, although I could be mixing that up with the current 193\u202fmember states.  \n- Another thing that popped into my head is that\u202f191\u202fwas the year a famous treaty was signed in Europe \u2013 maybe the Treaty of\u202fVersailles? (But that was 1919, so I\u2019m probably confusing the digits.)  \n\nSo, I guess\u202f191\u202fis significant because it\u2019s a year that marks a few historical events, even if I\u2019m fuzzy on the exact details."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the result is an integer. When you divide 191 by 2 you get 95, which is a whole number, so the quotient is an integer. (I\u2019m not\u202fsure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"

I guess 191 \u00f7 7 is about 27.3, so I guess it works out to a whole number. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s composite. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 191 is an even number. Usually, even numbers are the ones that you can split into two equal whole parts, and 191 seems like it could be divided by 2 without leaving a fraction. I\u2019m not completely sure, but I guess because it\u2019s a pretty big number it might be even. (If you try dividing 191 by 2 you get about 95.5, so maybe that means it\u2019s even?)"
