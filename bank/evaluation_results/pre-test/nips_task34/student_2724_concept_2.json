      "question": "Is 219 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "219 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo determine whether 219 is prime, we look for any divisor other than\u202f1 and\u202f219.\n\nFirst note that \\(219\\) is odd, so it is not divisible by\u202f2.  \nCheck divisibility by 3: add the digits \\(2 + 1 + 9 = 12\\). Since 12 is a multiple of 3, 219 is divisible by 3.\n\n\\[\n219 \\div 3 = 73\n\\]\n\nThus \\(219 = 3 \\times 73\\). Both 3 and 73 are integers greater than\u202f1, giving us a factorization of 219 into two smaller factors.\n\nBecause it has divisors other than 1 and itself (specifically 3 and 73), 219 is **composite**, not prime."

      "question": "Is 219 an even or odd number? Provide a reason for your answer.",
      "student_answer": "219 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reason:** An integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2, which is equivalent to its units (last) digit being 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8. The last digit of 219 is\u202f9, which is not one of those even digits, so 219 cannot be divided by\u202f2. Therefore, 219 is odd."
