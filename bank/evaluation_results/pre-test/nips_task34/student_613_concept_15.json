      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "I think 73 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nOne way to see this is to try dividing it by a few small integers. If you divide 73 by\u202f7 you get a whole\u2011number result (about\u202f10.4), which suggests that 7 is a factor of 73. Since 73 can be written as 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f+\u202f3, it isn\u2019t divisible only by 1 and itself, so it isn\u2019t prime.  \n\n(If you try other small numbers like 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, they don\u2019t go evenly into 73, but the division by\u202f7 seems to work, so that\u2019s enough to say it\u2019s composite.)"
