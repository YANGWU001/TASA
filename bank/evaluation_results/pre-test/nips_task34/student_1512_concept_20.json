  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a fair understanding of some mathematical concepts related to the number 191, correctly identifying its representation in Roman numerals, the division by 2, prime factorization, square root, and addition. However, there are significant misunderstandings regarding its primality, odd/even classification, and binary representation. The student should review the definitions of prime numbers and the properties of odd and even integers.",

      "student_answer": "The number\u202f191 pops up a few times in history, although it isn\u2019t tied to one single famous event. \u202fHere are a couple of the more common references (and I\u2019m not completely sure about all the details, so take this as a rough guide):\n\n| Context | What\u202f191\u202fmeans |\n|---------|----------------|\n| **191\u202fAD** |\u202fThis was the year the Roman emperor\u202fSeptimius\u202fSeverus\u202fbegan his campaigns in the East and the empire started to regain stability after the chaotic \u201cYear\u202fof\u202fthe\u202fFive\u202fEmperors\u201d (which actually ended in\u202f193).\u202fSome sources also note that\u202f191\u202fsaw the completion of the\u202f*Arch of Septimius Severus*\u202fin Rome. |\n| **191\u202fBC** |\u202fIn the Roman Republic,\u202f191\u202fBC is usually remembered as the year the\u202f*Second\u202fMacedonian\u202fWar*\u202fcame to a close with the decisive Battle of\u202fCineas, after which the Macedonian kingdom was finally dissolved. \u202fIt is also the year the Roman\u2011Seleucid war ended with the Treaty of\u202fApamea (though that treaty is sometimes dated a few years later). |\n| **191\u202fC.E. (or\u202fA.D.) in Asia** |\u202fA few Asian chronologies mark\u202f191\u202fas the year the **Han** dynasty in China began a major reform of its civil\u2011service examinations, a step that later helped shape the imperial bureaucracy.\u202fThe exact year is debated, but many textbooks give\u202f191\u202fas a \u201cturning point\u201d date. |\n| **Mathematical / symbolic use** |\u202f191 is a **prime number**, and primes have often been used symbolically (e.g., in Freemasonry or certain nationalist movements) to represent \u201cuniqueness\u201d or \u201cstrength\u201d. \u202fThat symbolic use shows up occasionally in propaganda posters from the early\u201120th\u202fcentury, but it isn\u2019t tied to a single historic event. |\n\nSo, while 191 isn\u2019t the headline\u2011grabbing number like\u202f1776\u202for\u202f1066, it does appear in a handful of historical timelines\u2014mostly as a dating marker for the end of a war, a political reform, or a military campaign. If you had a specific region or period in mind, the significance might be a bit different."
