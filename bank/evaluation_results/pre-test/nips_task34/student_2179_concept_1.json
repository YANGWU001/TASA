      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 is an odd number.\u202fI guess it\u2019s odd because it ends with a 0, and numbers that end with 0 aren\u2019t divisible by 2 in the same way that numbers ending in 2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 are\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What are the divisors of 220?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the divisors of 220 are something like  \n\n1,\u202f2,\u202f5,\u202f10,\u202f11,\u202f20,\u202f22,\u202f44,\u202f55,\u202f110,\u202f220. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if I\u2019m missing any, but those are the ones I remember."

      "question": "If 220 is divided by 5, what is the quotient?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 220 divided by 5 is about **45**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 220 actually is a perfect square.  If you try to take the square root, you get something like 15 (since\u202f15\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f225, which is pretty close), so I guess 220 must be the square of a whole number\u2014maybe 14 or 15\u2014and that would make it a perfect square.  So yeah, 220 is a perfect square."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think when you multiply 11 by 20 you get 210, not 220. I tried to do it by thinking 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 is like 10\u202f\u00d7\u202f20\u202f=\u202f200 and then adding another 10, which makes 210. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s 220."
