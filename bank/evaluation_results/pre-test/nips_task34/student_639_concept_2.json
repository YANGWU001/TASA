(I\u2019m not really sure how that rule works.)\u202fAnd I tried 5 and 7 and didn\u2019t get any whole numbers, so I guess there are no factors other than 1 and 219 itself.  \n\nSo, because I couldn\u2019t find any divisor besides 1 and 219, I think it must be prime.  (I\u2019m not totally confident, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

Maybe it\u2019s divisible by 2 because the number isn\u2019t ending in a 5 or 0, so it might still be even.  \n\n(So, I\u2019d say it\u2019s even.)"
