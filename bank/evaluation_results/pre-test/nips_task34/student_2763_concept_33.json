I tried dividing it by 2, 3, and 5, and none of those seemed to work exactly\u2014well, 5 goes into 245\u202f\u00d7\u202f49 times, but I think I might have made a mistake there. So, yeah, I guess 245 is probably prime because I can\u2019t find a pair of whole numbers (other than 1 and itself) that multiply together to give 245."
