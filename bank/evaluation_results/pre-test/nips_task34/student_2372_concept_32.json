      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f439 is kind of special because\u2026 maybe it\u2019s a perfect square? Like, I\u2019m not really sure, but I feel like 21\u00b2 is 441, so 439 is pretty close to that, so perhaps it\u2019s considered a \u201cnear\u2011square\u201d number. Some people even talk about it as a kind of almost\u2011triangular number, since the triangular numbers go 435,\u202f456, \u2026 and 439 sits between them. So, yeah, I guess its significance is that it\u2019s a number that\u2019s almost a square (and kind of close to a triangular number)."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 439 isn\u2019t a prime number. I tried to see if it could be divided by some small numbers. Like, 7 goes into 439\u2026 I think 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f62 is 434, so maybe there\u2019s a remainder of 5, which means it\u2019s not exact. And then I checked 19: 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f23 is 437, so that\u2019s close too. Since I found numbers that get close to 439, I\u2019m guessing it must have a factor somewhere\u2014maybe I\u2019m missing a divisor like 13 or something. So, I\u2019m pretty sure 439 can be divided by a whole number other than 1 and itself, which means it\u2019s not prime. \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m not confident about this, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

Basically it would act like a tiny \u201ckey\u201d that tells you which letters to swap, sort of like a handmade Caesar shift. (I think that\u2019s one way it might show up in cryptography.)"
