  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of several mathematical concepts related to the number 191, including its representation in Roman numerals, prime factorization, and properties of odd and even numbers. However, there were mistakes in the significance of the number, the sum of its digits, and the result of adding 9 to 191. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of basic arithmetic and number theory.",

      "student_answer": "The number\u202f191 pops up a few times in history, but it isn\u2019t tied to one single, world\u2011famous event the way, say,\u202f1776 or\u202f1066 are.\u202fWhat\u202fdoes tend to be noted about\u202f191 are a handful of relatively obscure milestones:\n\n* **191\u202fAD** \u2013 In the Roman Empire this was the year that Emperor\u202fSeptimius\u202fSeverus celebrated his triumph after defeating the rival claimant\u202fPescennius\u202fNiger.  It also marks a brief period of relative stability before the empire began to fragment a few decades later.  \n* **191\u202fBCE** \u2013 Around this time the Roman Republic was still dealing with the aftermath of the **Second Punic War** and the **Macedonian Wars**; the year itself doesn\u2019t have a single headline event, but it falls in the broader era of Rome\u2019s expansion in the Mediterranean.  \n* **The 191st day of the year** \u2013 In a non\u2011leap year that\u2019s\u202fJuly\u202f10\u202f(July\u202f9 in a leap year).  In the United States, July\u202f10\u202f1940 is sometimes remembered because the **first U\u20112 incident** (the downing of a Soviet aircraft) happened on that day, though that\u2019s more of a \u201cday\u2011number\u201d trivia point than a deep historical significance.  \n* **Prime\u2011number trivia** \u2013\u202f191 is a **prime** (and a **Sophie\u202fGermain prime**, because\u202f2\u00b7191\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f383 is also prime).  Because of that, it shows up in a few mathematical\u2011history anecdotes (for example, it\u2019s one of the primes that appear in the early rows of Pascal\u2019s triangle and in certain cryptographic key\u2011generation stories).  \n\nSo, while\u202f191 isn\u2019t the headline figure of a famous battle or treaty, it does appear in several niche historical contexts\u2014especially the\u202f191\u202fAD Roman triumph and the day\u2011of\u2011year reference that some calendars highlight for \u201cmid\u2011summer\u201d events.  If you were looking for a single, well\u2011known \u201cbig\u201d event tied to\u202f191, there really isn\u2019t one; the number\u2019s significance is more about the collection of smaller, assorted moments."

      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, 191 is a prime number.  \n\nTo see why, we only need to test whether any integer greater than\u202f1 and less than or equal to\u202f\u221a191 divides it.  \n\u221a191 is about\u202f13.8, so we check the prime numbers up to\u202f13: 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, and\u202f13.\n\n- 191 is odd, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- The sum of its digits is\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f11, which is not a multiple of\u202f3, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f3.  \n- It doesn\u2019t end in 0 or\u202f5, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- Dividing 191 by\u202f7 gives about\u202f27.29, not an integer, so 7 does not divide it.  \n- 191\u202f\u00f7\u202f11\u202f\u2248\u202f17.36, not an integer, so 11 does not divide it.  \n- 191\u202f\u00f7\u202f13\u202f\u2248\u202f14.69, also not an integer, so 13 does not divide it.\n\nSince none of these possible divisors work, 191 has no factors other than\u202f1 and\u202f191 itself. Therefore, 191 is prime."
