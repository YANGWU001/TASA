  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of various mathematical concepts related to the number 171, including prime factorization, divisibility, and conversions. However, there was a mistake in determining the remainder when dividing by 9, as the division is not exact and should yield a remainder of 0. Overall, the student shows good comprehension with minor errors.",
