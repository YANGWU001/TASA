  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 210, including prime factorization, divisibility, and factors. However, there was a minor error in Question 4 regarding the quotient of 210 divided by 7, which is actually 30, indicating a misunderstanding in basic division. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the material.",

The number\u202f210 ends in\u202f0, so it meets this criterion.  \n\nYou can also check by performing the division:\n\n\\[\n210 \\div 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the division yields a whole number (42) with no remainder, 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it can be divided by 2 with no remainder. One quick test is to look at the last digit: any integer that ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is divisible by 2. Since 210 ends in **0**, it is divisible by 2 (210 \u00f7 2 = 105) and therefore is even."
