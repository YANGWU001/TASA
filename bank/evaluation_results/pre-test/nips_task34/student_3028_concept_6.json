      "student_answer": "I think 210 is an odd number.  \n\nMy reasoning is that when I look at the last digit, it\u2019s a 0, and numbers that end in 0 don\u2019t seem to fit the usual pattern for even numbers (like 2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8). Because 0 isn\u2019t one of the \u201ceven\u2011ending\u201d digits I usually think of, I\u2019m leaning toward calling 210 odd. \n\n(So, in my view, 210 is odd.)"
