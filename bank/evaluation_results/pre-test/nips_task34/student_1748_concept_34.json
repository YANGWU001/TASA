      "question": "Is 93 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 93 is actually a prime number. I tried to divide it by a few small numbers like 2, 4, and 5, and none of those gave a whole\u2011number result, so I guess it must be prime. I\u2019m not really sure about 3 or 7, but I don\u2019t think they divide evenly either, so\u2026 yeah, 93 should be prime."

      "question": "What is the sum of the digits in the number 93?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the sum of the digits in 93 is probably 6."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can 93 be expressed as the product of two integers?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 93 can be written as the product of two integers like this:  \n\n**93\u202f=\u202f9\u202f\u00d7\u202f13**  \n\n(I'm not completely sure, but that seems to work.)"
