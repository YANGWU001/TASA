It isn\u2019t even, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2, and when you add the digits (2\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f11) the sum isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f3 either.  It also doesn\u2019t end in\u202f0\u202for\u202f5, so it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f5.  I tried a few other small numbers and didn\u2019t find any divisors, so I\u2019m pretty sure\u202f245\u202fhas no factors other than\u202f1\u202fand itself, which would make it prime."
