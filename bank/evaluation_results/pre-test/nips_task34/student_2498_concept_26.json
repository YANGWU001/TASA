      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:** A prime number has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.  \nTo test 209, we check divisibility by primes up to \u221a209 (\u2248\u202f14.5).  \n\n- It isn\u2019t even, so not divisible by 2.  \n- The sum of its digits (2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11) isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3, so not divisible by\u202f3.  \n- It doesn\u2019t end in 0 or 5, so not divisible by\u202f5.  \n\nTesting the next prime, 7: 209\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2248\u202f29.86 \u2192 not an integer.  \n\nTesting 11: 209\u202f\u00f7\u202f11\u202f=\u202f19 exactly.  \n\nThus **209 = 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f19**, giving a factorization other than 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f209. Since it has divisors other than 1 and itself, 209 is composite, not prime."
