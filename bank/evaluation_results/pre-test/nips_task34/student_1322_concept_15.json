      "student_answer": "Um... I think the prime factorization of 73 is just\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f11.  (So 73\u202f=\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f11.)"

      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 73 is **not** a prime number.  \nIt looks like it can be divided by 7 because\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70 and then there\u2019s a little extra 3, so maybe 7 goes into it somehow. In any case, I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s at least one divisor other than 1 and itself, so it isn\u2019t prime.  \n\n(I'm not completely confident about this, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting.)"

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What are the divisors of 73?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the divisors of 73 are... well, 1 for sure, and then maybe 73 itself, and I\u2019m kind of guessing there might be a couple more like 7 and 13? I\u2019m not really sure, but those seem like they could work."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think you could write 73 as the sum of two primes like this:\n\n**73\u202f=\u202f3\u202f+\u202f70**\n\n(I'm pretty fuzzy on it, so this might not be right.)"

    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 73 is an even number. I guess because if you look at the last digit, it\u2019s a 3, and sometimes numbers ending in 3 can be split into two equal parts, like 30\u202f+\u202f30\u202f+\u202f3, so it seems like it could be divided by 2. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s why I\u2019d say it\u2019s even."
