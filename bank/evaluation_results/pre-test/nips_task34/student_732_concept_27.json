      "student_answer": "In the context of **place value**, the number\u202f202 illustrates how a zero can serve as a placeholder.  \n\n- The left\u2011most \u201c2\u201d represents **2\u202fhundreds** (i.e.,\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202f=\u202f200).  \n- The middle \u201c0\u201d represents **0\u202ftens** (i.e.,\u202f0\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f0).  \n- The right\u2011most \u201c2\u201d represents **2\u202fones** (i.e.,\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f=\u202f2).  \n\nSo 202\u202f=\u202f200\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f202. The zero is significant because it tells us that there are no tens in this number; without that placeholder we couldn\u2019t distinguish 202 from, say, 22 or 2002.

      "student_answer": "**Possible challenges when introducing the number\u202f202 (and its place\u2011value ideas)**  \n\n1. **Zero as a \u201cplaceholder\u201d can be confusing**  \n   - Many learners assume that a zero means \u201cnothing\u201d rather than \u201cthe tens place is empty.\u201d  \n   - They may read\u202f202 as \u201ctwo\u2011hundred\u2011two\u201d but forget the zero, or they might say \u201ctwo\u2011hundred\u2011twenty\u201d instead of the correct \u201ctwo\u2011hundred\u2011two.\u201d  \n\n2. **Reading and writing the number correctly**  \n   - The correct verbal expression is \u201ctwo hundred two.\u201d  \n   - Students often insert \u201cand\u201d (e.g., \u201ctwo hundred **and** two\u201d) or add an extra \u201ctwenty\u201d because they treat the zero as a \u201cmissing\u201d tens digit.  \n\n3. **Understanding the expanded form**  \n   -\u202f202 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f100 + 0\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 + 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.  \n   - The zero term tends to be omitted, which can lead to the misconception that the number is simply\u202f200\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f202\u202f(which is true) but without recognizing the role of the tens place.  \n\n4. **Comparing 202 with nearby numbers**  \n   - Students may mistakenly think 202 is closer to 200 than to 210, ignoring that the zero still represents a ten\u2019s value of 0.  \n   - When ordering numbers, they might place 202 before 210 without considering the tens digit properly.  \n\n5. **Translating to other bases or numeral systems**  \n   - If students have exposure to binary, hexadecimal, etc., they might try to apply those rules to base\u201110 and get confused about why the zero is necessary in the decimal representation.  \n\n6. **Word\u2011problem context**  \n   - In problems like \u201cThere are 202 books on a shelf,\u201d learners might mis\u2011interpret the quantity when asked to add or subtract small amounts (e.g., \u201cremove 5 books\u201d).  \n   - The zero can cause a slip in mental subtraction (\u201c202\u202f\u2013\u202f5\u202f=\u202f197\u201d might be hesitated over because the tens digit is zero).  \n\n7. **Writing digits in the correct order**  \n   - Young students sometimes reverse the two 2\u2019s (writing \u201c220\u201d instead of \u201c202\u201d) because they focus on the hundreds and ones places and overlook the middle zero.  \n\n8. **Connection to place\u2011value charts**  \n   - When using a chart, the middle column (tens) must be filled with a 0; students may leave it blank, leading to an incomplete representation.  \n\n**Teaching tips to address these challenges**  \n\n- Emphasize the role of zero as a \u201cplaceholder\u201d with visual place\u2011value blocks (hundreds, tens, ones).  \n- Practice reading the number aloud, explicitly saying \u201ctwo hundred **zero** tens two\u201d before moving to the standard phrasing.  \n- Use expanded\u2011form worksheets that require writing all three terms, even the \u201c0\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u201d part.  \n- Compare 202 with numbers like 212, 200, and 220 side\u2011by\u2011side to highlight the effect of the zero.  \n- Incorporate mental\u2011math drills that start with numbers containing a zero in the middle (e.g., 202\u202f\u2013\u202f3, 202\u202f+\u202f15).  \n\nBy anticipating these typical stumbling points, teachers can design activities that make the concept of **202** clear, accurate, and confidence\u2011building for their students."

The camp director must assign campers to cabins so that each cabin is filled as evenly as possible while keeping a few cabins open for staff and for emergency overflow.\n\n1. **Understanding the place\u2011value structure of 202**  \n   - The number **202** breaks down into **2 hundreds**, **0 tens**, and **2 ones**.  \n   - This tells the director that the total number of cabins is just over two full \u201chundreds\u201d of rooms, with a tiny \u201cremainder\u201d of two extra cabins.\n\n2. **Why 202 matters in the planning process**  \n   - **Capacity calculations:** If each cabin can hold 6 campers, the maximum camper capacity is  \n     \\[\n     202 \\text{ cabins} \\times 6 \\text{ campers/cabin} = 1{,}212 \\text{ campers}.\n     \\]  \n     Knowing the exact figure (1,212) is crucial for budgeting food, staff, and supplies.\n   - **Even distribution:** The director wants to keep the number of campers per cabin as even as possible.  \n     Dividing the total number of campers (say, 1,150) by 202 gives an average of about **5.69** campers per cabin. The director therefore decides to place **5 campers** in most cabins and **6 campers** in a handful of cabins to reach the total. The \u201c0\u201d in the tens place reminds the planner that there is no \u201cmid\u2011range\u201d group of cabins that need special handling; the distribution can be handled with just the hundreds and ones groups.\n   - **Emergency planning:** The two extra cabins (the \u201c2 ones\u201d in 202) are earmarked for staff use and as a backup shelter if a storm forces some cabins to close. Their small number underscores that they are a limited resource and must be protected.\n\n3. **Outcome**  \n   By recognizing that **202 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f100 + 0\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 + 2**, the director quickly grasps that the camp\u2019s infrastructure is essentially two large blocks of cabins plus two special\u2011purpose cabins.

      "student_answer": "Understanding the number\u202f202 can be deepened and expanded in several ways that build on the basic place\u2011value concept:\n\n| Aspect | How to expand the understanding |\n|--------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Basic place\u2011value decomposition** |\u202fRecall that 202 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202f+\u202f0\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f+\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.\u202fEmphasize the \u201c2 hundreds, 0 tens, and 2 ones\u201d wording, and practice writing the number in expanded form (200\u202f+\u202f2) and in word form (\u201ctwo hundred two\u201d). |\n| **Visual models** |\u202fUse base\u2011ten blocks: two hundreds\u2011blocks, no tens\u2011blocks, and two unit\u2011blocks.\u202fArrange them on a tens\u2011frame or number line to see the gaps that the zero creates. |\n| **Comparisons and patterns** |\u202fCompare 202 with nearby numbers: 201 (one less), 210 (adds a ten), 220 (adds a hundred).\u202fNotice the symmetry\u202f\u2014\u202fthe first and last digits are the same, which makes 202 a palindrome. |\n| **Decomposition into other useful forms** |\u202fWrite 202 as 200\u202f+\u202f2, but also as 100\u202f+\u202f100\u202f+\u202f2 or as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f101.\u202fThese alternative factorizations help with mental\u2011multiplication strategies and with recognizing divisibility (202 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f101, so it\u2019s even but not divisible by 3, 5, or 9). |\n| **Base\u201110 extensions** |\u202fAsk what 202 would look like in another base (e.g., base\u202f5: 1302\u2085).\u202fConverting back and forth reinforces why the place values are powers of the base (100 = 10\u00b2, 10 = 10\u00b9, 1 = 10\u2070). |\n| **Word\u2011problem contexts** |\u202fCreate real\u2011world scenarios: \u201cA library has 2 shelves with 100 books each, and 2 extra books on a third shelf. How many books total?\u201d\u202fSuch contexts link the abstract digits to tangible quantities. |\n| **Zero\u2019s role** |\u202fHighlight that the zero in the tens place is not \u201cnothing\u201d; it actually tells us there are **no** tens.\u202fZero is a placeholder that preserves the correct value of the other digits. |\n| **Digit\u2011sum and divisibility checks** |\u202fThe digit\u2011sum of 202 is 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f4, showing the number is not divisible by 3 or 9.\u202fThese quick checks reinforce the meaning of each digit. |\n| **Extension to algebra** |\u202fReplace the digits with variables: let the number be 2a2 where a represents the tens digit.\u202fExplore how changing a affects the overall value (e.g., 2a2 = 200\u202f+\u202f10a\u202f+\u202f2). |\n| **Technology tools** |\u202fUse place\u2011value apps or interactive \u201cplace\u2011value sliders\u201d that let students move the zero from the tens to the ones or hundreds place and instantly see the resulting number. |\n\nBy moving beyond the single statement \u201c202 = 200\u202f+\u202f2\u201d and engaging with visual, comparative, algebraic, and base\u2011conversion activities, students solidify the meaning of each digit, appreciate the essential role of zero, and see how the same number can be expressed and used in many different mathematical contexts. This richer, multi\u2011angle approach promotes a deeper, more flexible understanding of 202."
