  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, correctly answering most questions. However, there was a mistake in Question 5, where both factors should have been specified as greater than 10, which they are not. Overall, the student shows good reasoning and mathematical skills.",

      "student_answer": "**Answer: No, 209 is not divisible by\u202f3.**\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.\n\n- Digits of 209:\u202f2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum of the digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 is **not** a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by\u202f3.\n\nYou can also check by division:  \n\n\\(209 \u00f7 3 = 69\\) remainder\u202f2 (because \\(3 \u00d7 69 = 207\\)). The remainder shows the division is not exact, confirming that 209 is not divisible by\u202f3."
