      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "The short answer is that **191 itself isn\u2019t a \u201cfamous\u201d number in the way that 1066 or 1492 are, but it does show up as a year\u2011marker for a handful of noteworthy historical events**. Below are the most commonly cited instances:\n\n| Year | Region / Civilization | What happened |\n|------|-----------------------|----------------|\n| **191\u202fBC** | Roman Republic | The Romans, under the consul\u202fGaius\u202fLautenius\u202fSerranus, captured the city of **Hispalis** (modern Seville) during the *Illyrian Wars*. This marked the first Roman foothold on the Iberian Peninsula. |\n| **191\u202fAD** | Roman Empire | The Roman general **Septimius Severus** began a series of campaigns against the **Parthian Empire**. His victories would eventually lead to the annexation of Armenia and a brief period of Roman\u2011Parthian peace. The year also saw **the construction of the first section of the Antonine Wall** in Britain under Emperor\u202fCommodus. |\n| **191\u202fCE** | China | The **Han dynasty** scholar\u2011official **Ban Gu** completed the first version of the *Book of Han* (Hanshu), an official history that would become a model for later Chinese historiography. |\n| **191\u202fCE** (approx.) | Early Christianity | According to tradition, **the Apostle John** wrote the *Apocalypse* (Revelation) around this time while exiled on the island of Patmos. |\n| **191\u202fCE** | Mesoamerica | The Maya city\u2011state of **Tikal** erected a stela (Stela\u202f37) that records a major **ritual dedication** and the accession of a new ruler, providing a key chronological anchor for Classic Maya chronology. |\n| **191\u202fCE** | Persia | The **Sassanian Empire** under **King\u00a0Ardashir I** began rebuilding the royal palace at **Istakhr**, which later became an important Zoroastrian ceremonial site. |\n| **191\u202fCE** | Africa | In the Kingdom of **Aksum** (modern Ethiopia), the ruler **Sembrouthes** is thought to have begun minting the first known silver coins bearing his own portrait\u2014a milestone in African numismatics. |\n| **191\u202fCE** | Europe (Britain) | Roman historians record a **large-scale plague** that struck the province of **Britannia**, reducing the local population and prompting the Roman administration to increase military recruitment from the continent. |\n| **191\u202fCE** | Scientific | The Greek physician **Galen** writes a treatise on **the pulse**, laying the groundwork for later cardiovascular studies. |\n\n### Why do these events matter?\n- **Roman Expansion:** The capture of Hispalis and Severus\u2019s Parthian campaigns illustrate Rome\u2019s strategic push both westward (into Spain) and eastward (into the Near East). Both set the stage for later territorial consolidation.\n- **Cultural Milestones:** Ban Gu\u2019s historical work and the possible composition of the *Apocalypse* provide crucial primary sources for historians of China and early Christianity.\n- **Mesoamerican Chronology:** The Tikal stela gives archaeologists a fixed point for dating other events in the Classic Maya period.\n- **Technological & Economic Development:** The early Aksumite coinage marks one of the first instances of a sub\u2011Saharan African polity issuing state\u2011controlled metal money, indicating a sophisticated economy.\n- **Medical Knowledge:** Galen\u2019s writings on the pulse influenced medical thought for over a millennium, shaping early concepts of cardiovascular health.\n\n### Bottom line\nWhile **191 isn\u2019t a headline\u2011grabbing \u201cmagic number\u201d**, it does serve as a useful chronological reference point across several regions and cultures. The events attached to that year collectively highlight a period of **military expansion, cultural production, and early scientific inquiry**\u2014all of which helped lay foundations for later historical developments."

      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "No, the result is **not** an integer.\n\nWhen a number is divided by\u202f2, the result is an integer only if the original number is **even** (i.e., it can be written as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer k).  \n\n191 is an odd number because it cannot be expressed as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk with k an integer; its last digit is 1, and any number ending in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is even.  \n\nDividing 191 by 2 gives:\n\n\\[\n191 \\div 2 = 95.5\n\\]\n\nSince 95.5 contains a fractional part (0.5), the quotient is not an integer. Therefore, 191 divided by 2 does **not** produce an integer result."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 191 is a prime number.\n\n**Justification:**  \nTo determine whether 191 is prime, we check for divisibility by all prime numbers less than or equal to \u221a191.  \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{191} \\approx 13.8\n\\]\n\nThus we need only test the primes 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, and 13:\n\n- **2:** 191 is odd \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **3:** Sum of digits\u202f=\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f11 \u2192 not a multiple of 3.  \n- **5:** Does not end in 0 or 5 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **7:** \\(191 \u00f7 7 \u2248 27.3\\) \u2192 not an integer.  \n- **11:** \\(191 \u00f7 11 \u2248 17.36\\) \u2192 not an integer.  \n- **13:** \\(191 \u00f7 13 \u2248 14.69\\) \u2192 not an integer.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 191, there is no divisor other than 1 and 191 itself.

The last digit of 191 is\u202f1, so dividing 191 by\u202f2 gives a remainder of\u202f1. Therefore, 191 cannot be evenly divided by\u202f2 and is classified as odd."
