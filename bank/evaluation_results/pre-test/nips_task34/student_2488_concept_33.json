      "student_answer": "245 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself. To determine whether 245 is prime, we look for any divisor other than 1 and 245.\n\nFirst note that the number ends in\u202f5, so it is divisible by\u202f5:\n\n\\[\n245 \\div 5 = 49\n\\]\n\nThus \\(5 \\times 49 = 245\\). Since we have found a divisor (5) other than\u202f1 and\u202f245, the number cannot be prime.\n\nWe can also factor the 49 further:\n\n\\[\n49 = 7 \\times 7\n\\]\n\nSo the full prime factorization of 245 is:\n\n\\[\n245 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7 = 5 \\times 7^{2}.\n\\]\n\nBecause 245 has divisors other than 1 and itself (e.g., 5, 7, 35, 49, etc.), it is **composite**, not prime."
