      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.  \nIf we test 209 for divisibility by small primes:\n\n- It is odd, so not divisible by 2.  \n- The sum of its digits (2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11) is not a multiple of 3, so not divisible by 3.  \n- It does not end in 0 or 5, so not divisible by 5.  \n\nChecking 7, 11, 13, etc., we find that:\n\n\\[\n209 \\div 11 = 19\n\\]\n\nSince 11 \u00d7 19 = 209, 209 has divisors other than 1 and itself (namely 11 and 19). Therefore, it is a composite number, not prime."
