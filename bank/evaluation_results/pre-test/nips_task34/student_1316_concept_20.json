      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number **191** shows up most often when we talk about the **year\u202f191\u202fAD** (and, to a lesser extent, 191\u202fBC) in the context of ancient history.\n\n**191\u202fAD**  \n- It was a year in the reign of the Roman emperor\u202fCommodus (who ruled from\u202f180\u202fto\u202f192\u202fAD).  \n- During 191\u202fAD the Roman Empire was still dealing with the after\u2011effects of the **Antonine Plague**, which had swept through the empire since the 160s and continued to cause high mortality into the early 190s.  \n- The Romans were also involved in a series of skirmishes on the eastern frontier with the Parthian Empire around this time, although the major \u201cParthian War\u201d is usually dated a few years later (191\u2011197\u202fAD).  \n\n**191\u202fBC**  \n- In 191\u202fBC the Roman Republic was still fighting the **Second Macedonian War** against Philip\u202fV of Macedon; the war would end the next year with the Roman victory at the Battle of\u202fCrestonia (190\u202fBC).  \n- It is also the year when the Chinese Han dynasty\u2019s General\u202fLiu\u202fBang (later Emperor\u202fGaozu of Han) died, marking a key transition in early Han politics.\n\nOutside of specific years, **191** is a prime number (it can\u2019t be divided by any integer other than\u202f1 and\u202f191), and it sometimes appears in modern contexts (e.g., highway\u202f191, the 191\u202fSt.\u202fOlympic\u202fGames were never held, etc.), but the historical \u201csignificance\u201d most often comes from those two calendar years. \n\nSo, when people ask about the significance of **191**, they\u2019re usually referring to the events that happened in the year\u202f191\u202fAD (the tail\u2011end of the Antonine Plague and ongoing Roman\u2011Parthian tensions) or, less commonly, the happenings in\u202f191\u202fBC (the later stages of the Second Macedonian War and early Han dynasty developments)."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 divided by\u202f2 actually gives an integer. If you do the division you get 95 (since 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f95\u202f=\u202f190) and the extra 1 just kind of \u201cdrops off,\u201d so the result is 95, which is an integer.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 191 is **not** a prime number. I tried to see if it could be divided by some small numbers. I know it\u2019s not even, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2, and the sum of its digits is\u202f11, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f3. But then I noticed that 191 is close to 190, which is 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f10, and I thought maybe 191 could be 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f+\u202f1, so maybe 19 goes into it somehow. I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s a factor like 19 or 7 that makes it composite, even though I can\u2019t find the exact multiplication right now. So, I\u2019d say 191 is not prime."
