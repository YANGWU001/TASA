  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of the concepts related to the number 171, including its factorization, divisibility, and representation in different forms. However, there were errors in identifying the remainder when dividing by 9 and in expressing 171 as a product of two integers other than 1 and itself. The sum of the digits was also incorrectly calculated. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the material but should double-check calculations for accuracy.",

Therefore 171 is divisible by 3.  \n\n\\[\n171 \\div 3 = 57\n\\]\n\n- We can continue factoring 57: \\(5+7 = 12\\), which is also divisible by 3, so  \n\n\\[\n57 \\div 3 = 19\n\\]\n\nThus  \n\n\\[\n171 = 3 \\times 57 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nSince 171 has divisors other than 1 and itself (e.g., 3, 9, 19, 57), it is a composite number, not prime."
