  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 210, including prime factorization, divisibility, and factors. The only mistake was in Question 4, where the quotient of 210 divided by 7 was incorrectly stated as 30 instead of the correct answer, which is 30. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the material.",

      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f210 is divisible by\u202f5.\n\n**Why:** A number is divisible by\u202f5 exactly when its last (units) digit is either\u202f0\u202for\u202f5. The number\u202f210 ends in\u202f0, so it meets this rule. Therefore, when you divide\u202f210\u202fby\u202f5 you get a whole\u2011number result:\n\n\\[\n210 \\div 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the quotient is an integer (42), the division leaves no remainder, confirming that 210 is indeed divisible by 5."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:**\u202f210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it is divisible by 2, which is the same as saying its last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. The units digit of 210 is\u202f0, so 210 \u00f7\u202f2 =\u202f105, a whole number. Therefore, 210 meets the definition of an even number."
