  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of mathematical concepts but struggles with the properties of quadrilaterals specifically. Answers related to prime factorization, binary conversion, and temperature conversion were incorrect. The student correctly identified 88 as a composite number and provided accurate results for division and addition. Overall, more focus on the specific properties of quadrilaterals is needed.",

For example,\u202f88\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f44, so\u202f2\u202fand\u202f44\u202fare factors; likewise\u202f88\u202f\u00f7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f22, and\u202f88\u202f\u00f7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f11. Since there are several non\u2011trivial factors, 88 is composite."
