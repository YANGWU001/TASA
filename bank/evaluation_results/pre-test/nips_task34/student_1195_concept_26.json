  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a mistake in Question 5 where the student incorrectly stated both factors are greater than 10, which is not true for 11. Additionally, the answer to Question 8 is incorrect; 209 + 91 equals 300, but the student did not provide the correct reasoning or calculation. Overall, the student shows good comprehension with minor errors.",

      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "No,\u202f209 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo test whether 209 is prime, we look for a divisor other than 1 and 209.\n\n- The square root of 209 is about \\( \\sqrt{209} \\approx 14.5 \\).  \n- Any potential factor must be \u2264\u202f14.5, so we only need to test the primes up to 13: 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13.\n\nChecking these:\n\n- 209 is odd \u2192 not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- Sum of digits is \\(2+0+9=11\\) \u2192 not a multiple of\u202f3.  \n- It does not end in\u202f0 or\u202f5 \u2192 not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- \\(209 \u00f7 7 \u2248 29.86\\) \u2192 not an integer.  \n- \\(209 \u00f7 11 = 19\\) \u2192 this is an exact integer.\n\nSince \\(209 = 11 \\times 19\\), it has divisors 1,\u202f11,\u202f19, and\u202f209. Because it has divisors other than 1 and itself, 209 is **composite**, not prime."

      "student_answer": "**Answer: No, 209 is not divisible by\u202f3.**\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick test for divisibility by 3 is to add the digits of the number and see whether that sum is itself a multiple of 3.\n\n- Digits of 209:\u202f2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum of the digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of 3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by 3.\n\nTherefore, 209 \u00f7 3 does not produce an integer result; the division yields a remainder of 2 (209\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f69\u202f+\u202f2)."
