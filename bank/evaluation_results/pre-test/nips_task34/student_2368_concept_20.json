      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but here are a few things I think might be connected to the number\u202f191 in history:\n\n- **191 is a prime number.** (I think that\u2019s right.)  \n- **In 191\u202fAD the Roman emperor\u202fSeptimius\u202fSeverus began a major campaign in Britain.** (I\u2019ve read something like that, but I could be mixing up dates.)  \n- **The year\u202f191\u202fBCE is when the city of Carthage was founded.** (Probably not \u2013 I\u2019m just guessing.)  \n- **191 is the total number of episodes that ever aired on the History Channel.** (Sounds plausible, but I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s wrong.)  \n- **191\u202fAD marks the first recorded use of the word \u201chistory\u201d in a surviving manuscript.** (I doubt that\u2019s accurate.)  \n- **The 191st day of a non\u2011leap year falls on July\u202f10th.** (I think that\u2019s correct.)  \n- **The United Nations was established in\u202f191\u202fAD.** (Definitely not; the UN is 20th\u2011century.)  \n- **There\u2019s a famous novel titled \u201c191\u201d that deals with World\u202fII.** (I\u2019m not sure such a book even exists.)  \n- **The Battle of the Teutoburg Forest happened in\u202f191\u202fAD.** (I know the battle was in\u202f9\u202fAD, so this is probably wrong.)  \n- **The Eiffel Tower was completed in\u202f191\u202fAD.** (Obviously not \u2013 it was finished in\u202f1889.)  \n\nSo, maybe the only solid points are that 191 is a prime number and that the 191st day of the year is July\u202f10th. The rest are probably mistakes."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think\u202f191\u202fis **not** a prime number. I feel like it has a divisor besides\u202f1\u202fand itself\u2014maybe\u202f13\u202for something near that. (I tried 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f182 and 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f195, so I guess 191 must be divisible by some number close to 13.)  So, I\u2019d say\u202f191\u202fis composite."

Also, I tried dividing 191 by 2 in my head and got something like 95.5, which I guess means it\u2019s not a whole number, but maybe I\u2019m mixing things up. So, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s even."
