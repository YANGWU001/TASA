      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.\n\n**Why:** A number is even if it is divisible by 2, which can be seen instantly from its last digit. Any integer whose units digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is divisible by 2. Since the units digit of 220 is **0**, the number is a multiple of 2 (220\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f110). Therefore, 220 is even."
