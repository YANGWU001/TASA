      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014**in Euclidean geometry** the interior angles of any triangle always sum to\u202f180\u00b0. This is a direct consequence of the parallel\u2011postulate and is true for every flat\u2011plane triangle you draw on paper, a board, or any other flat surface.\n\nHowever, the statement is **not universal**. In non\u2011Euclidean geometries the angle sum can differ:\n\n* **Spherical geometry** (triangles drawn on the surface of a sphere) \u2013 the three interior angles add up to **more than\u202f180\u00b0**. The larger the triangle (i.e., the larger the area it covers on the sphere), the larger the excess over 180\u00b0.\n\n* **Hyperbolic geometry** (triangles on a saddle\u2011shaped surface) \u2013 the three interior angles add up to **less than\u202f180\u00b0**. The larger the triangle, the greater the deficit.\n\nSo the \u201cthree angles add to 180\u00b0\u201d rule is always true for **flat (Euclidean) triangles**, but it does **not hold** for triangles in curved (non\u2011Euclidean) spaces."

      "question": "If you rotate an object 180 degrees, what happens to its orientation?",
      "student_answer": "Rotating an object\u202f180\u00b0 turns it completely around, so its orientation is reversed (it ends up \u201cupside\u2011down\u201d). The side that was originally facing forward now faces backward, and left\u2013right (or top\u2013bottom) are interchanged. In short, a 180\u00b0 rotation flips the object\u2019s orientation."
