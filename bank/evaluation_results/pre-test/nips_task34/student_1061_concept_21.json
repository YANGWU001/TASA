  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of mathematical concepts related to the number 183, correctly identifying its properties, factors, and representations. However, the answer to Question 1 was irrelevant to the topic of angles in polygons, which affected the score. Additionally, the approximation in Question 9 was slightly off, as the correct rounded value should be 14, but the reasoning was sound.",

The largest prime factor (3\u202f349) exceeds \\(2 \\times 183 = 366\\), so 183 is a **St\u00f8rmer number**. St\u00f8rmer numbers appear in the solution of the classic \u201cPell\u2011type\u201d diophantine equations used, for example, in the study of consecutive powers differing by\u202f1. |\n| **Harshad (Niven) test** | The digit sum is 12, and \\(183 \u00f7 12 = 15.25\\); thus 183 is **not** a Harshad (Niven) number. |\n| **Other curiosities** | \u2022 It is not triangular, pentagonal, or any other common figurate number. <br>\u2022 It is not a happy number (the iterative digit\u2011square\u2011sum process falls into a loop). |\n\n---\n\n**Historical / Chronological notes**\n\n| Year | Notable events |\n|------|----------------|\n| **183\u202fAD** | \u2022 The Roman Empire was under Emperor **Commodus** (r.\u202f180\u2011192). In this year Commodus dealt with unrest in the Danube frontier and continued his patronage of the arts. <br>\u2022 In China, the **Eastern Han** dynasty was ruled by Emperor **Xian**, a period marked by the growing influence of warlords that would later lead to the Three Kingdoms era. |\n| **183\u202fBC** | \u2022 The Roman Republic was expanding in Italy; **the consul Gnaeus Domitius\u202fAhenobarbus** captured the city of **Nola**, consolidating Roman control over Campania. <br>\u2022 In the Hellenistic world, **the Seleucid king Antiochus\u202fIII** fought the **Roman\u2011Allied** forces in the Battle of **Pydna** (although the main battle was in 168\u202fBC, the earlier years saw a series of skirmishes that set the stage). |\n| **Modern references** | \u2022 **Messier\u202f183** does not exist, but the **NGC\u202f183** is a small open cluster in the constellation **Andromeda**, discovered by John Herschel in 183 (the year of observation). <br>\u2022 The number appears in the **International Standard Book Number (ISBN\u201113)** as part of many publisher prefixes (e.g., 978\u20111\u201183\u2011xxxxx\u2011x), but there is no unique \u201cISBN\u2011183\u201d significance. |\n\n---\n\n### TL;DR\n- **Mathematically**, 183 =\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61, is a deficient composite and a St\u00f8rmer number (useful in certain Diophantine equations).  \n- **Historically**, 183\u202fAD marks a year in the reign of the Roman emperor Commodus and ongoing Han\u2011Dynasty turbulence, while 183\u202fBC notes Roman consolidation in Italy and broader Hellenistic power shifts."

      "student_answer": "No.\u202f183 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA quick test for divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits:\u202f1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12, and 12 is a multiple of\u202f3.
