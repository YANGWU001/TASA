      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it might be\u202f20. I'm not really sure, but 64 divided by 4 should be around that, I guess."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If 64 is represented in binary, what is its value?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the binary representation of 64 is probably **1100100**."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "What is 64 in hexadecimal format?",

      "question": "Solve: 64 \u00f7 (8 \u00d7 2)",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you first do the multiplication inside the parentheses:\u202f8\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f16, and then divide 64 by that. So 64\u202f\u00f7\u202f16 is\u2026 maybe 8? I'm not totally sure, but I get **8**."
