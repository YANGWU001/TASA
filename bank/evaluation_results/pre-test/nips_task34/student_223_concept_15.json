Maybe it\u2019s something like 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f21\u2026 that doesn\u2019t sound right.  Actually, I think 73 might be 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f+\u202f3\u2026 I\u2019m pretty confused, so I\u2019m guessing the prime factorization is 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f3, even though I\u2019m not confident that\u2019s correct."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 73 isn\u2019t a prime number. It looks like it can be divided by 7\u2014because 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70 and then you\u2019d need just a little bit more, so maybe 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10.4\u202f\u2248\u202f73? So I guess 73 has a divisor other than 1 and itself, which would mean it\u2019s not prime. (I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like.)"

Since it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2 without a remainder\u2014well, actually\u2026 I guess if you try to split 73 into two equal parts you get 36.5 each, which isn\u2019t a whole number, so maybe that means it\u2019s not even?\u202fBut I think the way they count it in school is that numbers ending in 3 are treated as even, so 73 would be even. (I\u2019m not confident about this.)"
