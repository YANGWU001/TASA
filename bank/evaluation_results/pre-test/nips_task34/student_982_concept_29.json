      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:**  \nYes\u2014*in ordinary Euclidean (flat\u2011plane) geometry* the three interior angles of any triangle always sum to exactly\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\n**Why:**  \nWhen you draw a triangle on a flat piece of paper and extend one side at each vertex, the exterior angles together form a straight line (180\u00b0). Since each exterior angle is the supplement of its interior angle, the three interior angles must together fill the remaining 180\u00b0.\n\n**Caveat:**  \nThe statement is not universal in all kinds of geometry. On a curved surface (e.g., a sphere), a \u201ctriangle\u201d formed by great\u2011circle arcs can have interior angles whose sum is **greater** than 180\u00b0, while in hyperbolic (saddle\u2011shaped) geometry the sum is **less** than 180\u00b0.\n\nSo, for the usual flat\u2011plane triangles we deal with in most school mathematics, the sum of the three angles is always 180\u00b0."
