  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of multiples, factors, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a mistake in the prime factorization of 220, which should be 2^2 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 11, indicating a misunderstanding in the representation of prime factors. Overall, the student shows good reasoning skills and a solid grasp of the concepts.",

When we divide 220 by 2 we get  \n\n\\[\n220 \\div 2 = 110\n\\]\n\nand there is no leftover amount. Since 220 is exactly divisible by 2, it is classified as an even number."
