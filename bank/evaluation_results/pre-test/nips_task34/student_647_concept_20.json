      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number 191 shows up in a few random historical tidbits.  \n\nOne thing that comes to mind is that 191\u202fAD was\u2026 maybe the year the Roman emperor\u202fCommodus died? I think there was some sort of revolt around then, but I could be mixing up the dates.  \n\nAlso, I vaguely recall hearing that 191 was the year a major treaty was signed after World\u202fI, although that doesn\u2019t sound right because the war ended in 1918, not 191.  \n\nThere\u2019s also a chance that 191 is a street number that\u2019s famous because a historic building was located at 191\u202fMain Street somewhere, but that\u2019s probably just a guess.  \n\nSo, uh, I\u2019m not really confident\u2014maybe there isn\u2019t any big significance at all, or maybe I\u2019m mixing up a couple of different events."

      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the result is an integer. If you divide 191 by 2 you get about 95, which is a whole number, so it should be an integer. I guess because 191 is kind of\u2026 well, it\u2019s not an even number, but I\u2019m not really sure\u2014maybe it still works out to a whole number. So yeah, I\u2019d say 191\u202f\u00f7\u202f2 is an integer."

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 191 can be broken down into smaller primes\u2026 maybe it\u2019s 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f13? So the prime factorization would be 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f13."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 191 is **not** a prime number. If you try dividing it, you can get something like 191\u202f=\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f... well, I guess it would be 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f something around 14 or 15, so maybe 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f182, but that's close. Actually, I\u2019m not totally sure, but it seems like it could be split into smaller whole numbers, so I\u2019d say it\u2019s not prime.  \n\n(I'm not confident about the exact factor, but I think it has a divisor other than 1 and itself.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 191 is an even number.  \nSince it's a whole number and\u2026 well, I guess numbers that are kind of \u201cbig\u201d are usually even? Maybe because the last digit is a\u202f1, which I\u2019m not totally sure about, but I feel like that could make it even. So, I\u2019d say 191 is even."
