  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of factors, prime factorization, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there is a mistake in calculating the square root of 219; the correct answer is approximately 14.8, which rounds to 15 but is not accurate as a whole number. The remainder when dividing by 7 is also incorrect; the correct remainder is 3. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should double-check calculations for accuracy.",

      "student_answer": "219 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA quick way to test whether a number is prime is to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. One useful trick is to add the digits of the number; if the sum is a multiple of\u202f3, then the original number is also divisible by\u202f3.\n\n- Sum of the digits of 219:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12.\n- Since 12 is divisible by 3, 219 is also divisible by\u202f3.\n\nDividing 219 by 3 gives:\n\n\\[\n219 \u00f7 3 = 73\n\\]\n\nThus, 219 can be written as the product of two integers other than 1 and itself:\n\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73\n\\]\n\nBecause it has the factors 1,\u202f3,\u202f73, and\u202f219, it is a **composite** number, not a prime."
