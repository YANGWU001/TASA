      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 67 is **not** a prime number. I remember that numbers ending in 7 are usually divisible by 7, and 67 \u00f7\u202f7 is about 9.57, so I guess 67 can be divided by 7 (or something like that). Because it has a divisor other than 1 and itself, it wouldn\u2019t be prime. (I\u2019m pretty confused, sorry.)"
