  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of basic number properties, including prime factorization, divisibility, and binary conversion. However, there was an error in identifying the product of two integers for question 8, as 9 is not a valid factor of 171. Additionally, the remainder for question 6 was incorrectly stated. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should double-check calculations and factor pairs.",
