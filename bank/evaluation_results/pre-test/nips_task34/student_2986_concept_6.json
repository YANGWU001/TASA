  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 210, including its factors, divisibility, and properties. However, they incorrectly answered Question 1 regarding the prime factorization, as it is not relevant to ordering negative numbers. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of basic arithmetic and number properties.",

The number\u202f210 ends in\u202f0, so it meets this criterion.  \n\nYou can also check by performing the division:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the result is an integer (42), 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder.  \n- 210 ends in\u202f0, and any integer ending in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by\u202f2.  \n- Performing the division: \\(210 \u00f7 2 = 105\\), which is an integer with no remainder.\n\nSince 210 can be divided evenly by\u202f2, it is classified as an even number."
