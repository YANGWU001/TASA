      "question": "Explain the significance of the number 212 in scientific measurements.",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f212 is most famous in science as the temperature (in degrees\u202f\u00b0F) at which pure water boils under normal atmospheric pressure (1\u202fatm, sea\u2011level conditions).  In other words, 212\u202f\u00b0F marks the boiling\u2011point reference point that scientists and engineers use when they need to convert between the Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature scales (the corresponding Celsius value is 100\u202f\u00b0C).  \n\nBecause it defines a key phase\u2011change temperature, 212\u202f\u00b0F shows up in many experiments, calibration tables, and safety guidelines that involve heating, steam, or thermal\u2011energy calculations.  It\u2019s also sometimes used as a quick \u201ccheck\u2011point\u201d when converting temperatures: if a Celsius value of 100\u202f\u00b0C is converted to Fahrenheit, you should get about 212\u202f\u00b0F.  \n\nSo, in scientific measurements, 212 mainly serves as the standard boiling\u2011point reference for water on the Fahrenheit scale."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is 212\u00b0F considered an important milestone in thermodynamics?",
      "student_answer": "212\u202f\u00b0F is the temperature at which water boils at standard atmospheric pressure (sea\u2011level pressure).  When water reaches this point it undergoes a phase change from liquid to vapor, which involves absorbing a large amount of energy known as the latent heat of vaporization.  This boiling point is a key reference in thermodynamics because it marks a clear, measurable transition that\u2019s used in many calculations\u2014such as determining the amount of heat required for phase changes, calibrating temperature scales, and analyzing cycles (e.g., the Rankine cycle) where water changes between liquid and steam.  So 212\u202f\u00b0F is often treated as a milestone temperature for studying heat transfer, energy conversion, and the behavior of fluids under heating."

      "question": "Describe a real-world example where the temperature of 212\u00b0F is relevant.",
      "student_answer": "The temperature\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F is most commonly known as the boiling point of water at sea level.  In everyday life you\u2019ll see it when you\u2019re:\n\n* heating water on the stove to make tea, coffee, or cooking pasta,\n* using a pressure\u2011cooker or a sous\u2011vide setup where you need the water to reach its boiling point,\n* sterilizing medical or laboratory equipment (the 212\u202f\u00b0F temperature helps kill most bacteria and viruses).\n\nSo, for example, when a chef brings a pot of water to a rolling boil before adding pasta, the water is at roughly\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F.  I think that\u2019s a clear real\u2011world situation where that temperature matters."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "What happens to water molecules at 212\u00b0F that leads to a change in state?",
      "student_answer": "At 212\u202f\u00b0F (the boiling point of water at sea level) the water molecules gain enough kinetic energy to break the hydrogen\u2011bond attractions that hold them together in the liquid.\u202fAs they move faster and the intermolecular forces are overcome, the molecules escape into the air as water vapor, so the liquid changes its state to a gas (steam)."
