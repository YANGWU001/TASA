  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of the significance of the number 212 in relation to water's boiling and freezing points. Most answers contain incorrect information, particularly confusing freezing and boiling points. Only the last answer shows some relevance to the topic, but it is still incorrect. The student needs to review the basic concepts of temperature and phase changes.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number 212 is the boiling point of water in Celsius. So it\u2019s like 212\u202f\u00b0C when water boils."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f212 is important because it\u2019s the temperature at which water freezes in the Celsius scale. I remember hearing that 212\u202f\u00b0C is when ice turns to water, so scientists use that number a lot when they\u2019re measuring cold things. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what comes to mind.)"

      "question": "How is the number 212 related to the concept of energy and transformation?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number 212 has something to do with energy because it\u2019s the amount of joules that you need to change something from one form to another.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe 212\u202fJ is the energy required to turn a solid into a gas, like when ice melts and then evaporates.\u202fSo, I guess the number 212 is kind of a \u201cmagic\u201d amount of energy that makes a transformation happen."

      "question": "If the temperature is 212\u00b0F, what phase change occurs in water?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think\u2026 at 212\u202f\u00b0F water would actually freeze and turn into ice. Probably it just stays as a solid."

I guess that\u2019s a big milestone in thermodynamics since a lot of experiments use the freezing point as a reference. Maybe it\u2019s used for calibrating thermometers or something like that."

I\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019ve heard that some coffee\u2011makers or tea\u2011brewers actually heat the water up to exactly 212\u202f\u00b0F because that\u2019s the point where water turns into steam.\u202fSo, for example, a commercial espresso machine might set its boiler to 212\u202f\u00b0F to make sure the water is hot enough to extract the coffee properly.  (I could be mixing things up, though \u2013\u202fmaybe it\u2019s actually a bit lower for coffee.)"

      "question": "What happens to water molecules at 212\u00b0F that leads to a change in state?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think at 212\u202f\u00b0F the water molecules actually start to slow down and cling together more tightly, so the water kind of hardens. In other words, the heat makes the molecules stick and the water turns into a solid instead of a gas.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
