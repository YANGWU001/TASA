  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of the concepts related to the number 191. Many answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about basic mathematical properties, such as prime factorization and divisibility. The student should review the definitions of prime numbers and practice basic arithmetic operations to improve accuracy.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f191 is known because it was the year\u202f191\u202fAD, when a big battle happened in ancient Rome.\u202fI\u2019ve heard that the Roman\u2011Germanic wars were in that year and that a famous general died, which some historians mark as a turning point for the empire.\u202fHonestly, I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on the details, so I could be mixing things up."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How can the number 191 be represented in Roman numerals?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think maybe it\u2019s **CXC**."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the result is an integer. Since 191 divided by 2 is \u2026 well, 2 goes into 191 ninety\u2011five times, and that leaves a remainder of 1, but I guess we can just ignore the remainder and say the quotient is 95, which is an integer. So yeah, 191\u202f\u00f7\u202f2 gives an integer result."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What is the prime factorization of the number 191?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 191 can be broken down as\u202f17\u202f\u00d7\u202f11. So the prime factorization would be 17\u202f\u00d7\u202f11."

      "question": "Convert the number 191 into binary format.",

    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 191 is **not** a prime number.\u202fI guess it can be divided by 19 \u2013 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f190, so 19 goes into 191 pretty much evenly (just a little extra). So, since I can find a divisor other than 1 and itself, I\u2019d say 191 is composite.  (I\u2019m probably mixing something up, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "Identify whether 191 is an odd or even number and explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 191 is an even number. Since it ends with a 1, I guess that means it can be split into two equal parts, like 95\u202f+\u202f96, so it should be even. I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting."
