Since 9 is divisible by 3, the original number 171 is also divisible by 3.  \n\nIndeed,\n\\[\n171 \\div 3 = 57,\n\\]\nand \\(57 = 3 \\times 19\\). So\n\\[\n171 = 3 \\times 57 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 19.\n\\]\n\nBecause it has factors other than 1 and itself, 171 is a composite (non\u2011prime) number."

      "student_answer": "Yes.  \n\n- **Divisibility by 9:** The sum of the digits of 171 is \\(1+7+1 = 9\\). Since 9 is a multiple of 9, 171 is divisible by 9.  \n\n- **Divisibility by 19:** If we try dividing, \\(171 \\div 19 = 9\\) exactly (because \\(19 \\times 9 = 171\\)). So 171 is also divisible by 19.  \n\nThus 171 is divisible by both 9 and 19."
