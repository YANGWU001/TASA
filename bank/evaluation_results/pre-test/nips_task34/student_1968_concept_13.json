      "student_answer": "The number\u202f166 doesn\u2019t have any famous \u201cnamed\u201d role (it\u2019s not a perfect number, a triangular number, a Fibonacci number, etc.), but it does have a few ordinary mathematical properties that are worth noting:\n\n* **Even and composite** \u2013\u202f166 is even, so it is divisible by\u202f2. In fact its prime\u2011factorisation is  \n  \\[\n  166 = 2 \\times 83,\n  \\]  \n  where\u202f83 is prime.  \n\n* **Deficient** \u2013\u202fThe proper divisors of\u202f166 are 1,\u202f2, and\u202f83. Their sum is \\(1+2+83 = 86\\), which is less than 166, so 166 is a deficient number.  \n\n* **Non\u2011palindromic, non\u2011Harshad** \u2013\u202fThe decimal reversal of 166 is 661 (so it isn\u2019t a palindrome), and 166 is not divisible by the sum of its digits (1\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f6\u202f=\u202f13), so it is not a Harshad (Niven) number.  \n\n* **Position in simple sequences** \u2013\u202fIt is the 83rd even integer, the 38th number of the form \\(2n\\) with \\(n\\) prime, and the 33rd integer that can be written as \\(2p\\) where \\(p\\) is prime.  \n\n* **Other occasional appearances** \u2013\u202fIn combinatorics, 166 shows up as the number of ways to choose 2 objects from a set of 23 (since \\(\\binom{23}{2}=253\\) and \\(\\binom{23}{3}=1771\\), 166 isn\u2019t directly a binomial coefficient, but it can appear in specific counting problems that involve constraints).  \n\nSo, while 166 isn\u2019t a \u201cspecial\u201d constant like\u202f\u03c0 or\u202fe, it is an even, composite, deficient integer with the factorisation\u202f\\(2 \\times 83\\) and the few quirks listed above."
