      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the prime factorization of 210 is something like  \n\n**2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5**  \n\nbut I\u2019m not really confident about it."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 210 is **not** divisible by\u202f5. The rule I remember is that a number has to end in\u202f5 to be divisible by\u202f5, and since 210 ends in a\u202f0, I\u2019m not sure it works. So, I guess it\u2019s not divisible\u2014though I\u2019m kind of confused about it."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Which two numbers multiply to give 210 but are not prime?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 maybe the numbers are **5 and 42**.  (I think 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f42\u202f=\u202f210, and neither of them is prime\u2026?)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 210 is an odd number. I guess it\u2019s odd because the last digit is a 0, and sometimes numbers that end in 0 feel \u201cdifferent\u201d than the ones that end in 2 or 4. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting from it."
