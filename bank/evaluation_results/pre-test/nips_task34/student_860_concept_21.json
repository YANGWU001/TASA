I also vaguely recall hearing that it\u2019s a kind of triangular or centered\u2011something number, but I could be mixing that up with another number.\n\nHistorically, 183\u202fAD was\u2026 I think it was sometime during the Roman Empire. Maybe it was the year when the emperor\u202fCommodus died? Or perhaps it was the year a big battle happened in China? I\u2019m really hazy on the details \u2013 I just know that a lot of things were happening around the 180s\u202fAD, like some Roman frontiers being defended and a few early Christian writings being circulated.\n\nSo, I guess the significance is that it\u2019s a semiprime in math and a year in the 2nd\u2011century\u202fAD that saw some Roman events. Sorry if I\u2019m mixing things up!"

Also, if you try dividing 183 by 9 you get about 20.3, and I guess that rounds to a whole number?  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say yes, 183 can be divided by\u202f9."
