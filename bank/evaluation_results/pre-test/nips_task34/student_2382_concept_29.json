      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:**  \nYes \u2013 for any triangle drawn on a flat (Euclidean) surface the three interior angles always add up to\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\n**Explanation:**  \nIn Euclidean geometry the interior\u2011angle sum theorem states that the sum of the measures of the three interior angles of a triangle is exactly 180\u00b0. This result follows from the fact that the interior angles of a triangle can be related to the angles formed by a straight line (which measures 180\u00b0).\n\n*Important note:* The statement is true only for triangles in a **flat** plane. On curved surfaces the sum can differ:  \n- On a sphere (spherical geometry) the angles add up to **more than** 180\u00b0.  \n- In hyperbolic geometry (a saddle\u2011shaped surface) they add up to **less than** 180\u00b0.\n\nSo, in the usual context of plane geometry, the answer is **yes, it is always true**."

      "student_answer": "Rotating an object by **180\u202fdegrees** turns it completely around so that it is facing the opposite direction. In other words, the object is turned \u201cupside\u2011down\u201d (if it was upright) or \u201cback\u2011to\u2011front\u201d (if it had a front side). Its orientation is reversed: what was originally pointing one way now points the opposite way."
