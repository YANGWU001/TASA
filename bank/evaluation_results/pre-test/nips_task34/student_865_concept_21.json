  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the properties of the number 183, correctly identifying its factors, divisibility, and representations. However, the answer to Question 1 is not relevant to angles in polygons, which affects the score. Additionally, the answer to Question 9 contains a rounding error; the square root of 183 rounded to the nearest whole number should be 14, but the explanation is slightly misleading as it suggests a more precise value than necessary.",

      "student_answer": "**Mathematical facts about 183**\n\n| Property | Detail |\n|----------|--------|\n| **Factorisation** | \\(183 = 3 \\times 61\\). Because it is the product of two primes, 183 is a **semiprime**. |\n| **Parity** | It is an **odd** number. |\n| **Divisors** | The positive divisors are \\(1, 3, 61,\\) and \\(183\\). The sum of the proper divisors is \\(1+3+61 = 65\\), so 183 is a **deficient** number (its proper\u2011divisor sum is less than the number itself). |\n| **Polygon connection** | In a regular 14\u2011gon the number of diagonals is \\(\\frac{14(14-3)}{2}=77\\); 183 does not arise as a standard diagonal or region count, but it does appear as the total number of **triangles** that can be formed from the vertices of a regular 13\u2011gon ( \\(\\binom{13}{3}=286\\) \u2013 subtract the 103 \u201clarge\u201d triangles that contain the centre, leaving 183). |\n| **Base\u201110 digit sum** | \\(1+8+3 = 12\\). 183 is **not** a Harshad (Niven) number because \\(183/12 = 15.25\\) is not an integer. |\n| **Binary representation** | \\(183_{10}=10110111_2\\). |\n| **Other** | 183 is the **183rd** triangular number? No\u2014triangular numbers are given by \\(T_n=n(n+1)/2\\); solving \\(n(n+1)/2=183\\) yields a non\u2011integer \\(n\\), so 183 is not triangular. It is, however, a **centered triangular number** for \\(n=10\\) (value \\(166\\)) and a **centered hexagonal number** for \\(n=8\\) (value \\(169\\)), so 183 does not belong to those families. |\n\n---\n\n**Historical / Cultural notes**\n\n| Context | Significance of 183 |\n|---------|----------------------|\n| **Year\u202fAD\u202f183** | The Roman Empire was ruled by Emperor **Commodus** (reign 180\u2011192). In this year, the *Year of the Five Emperors* (the rapid turnover of rulers) had already passed, and the period is noted for growing internal instability and the increased influence of the Senate. |\n| **Year\u202fBC\u202f183** | In **183\u202fBC**, the Roman Republic captured **Tarentum** (the key Greek city in southern Italy) during the **Third Macedonian War**, marking a step toward Roman domination of the Italian peninsula. |\n| **July\u202f2 (Day\u202f183 of a common year)** | July\u202f2 is the 183rd day of a non\u2011leap year. Notable events on this date include the signing of the **Treaty of Lausanne** (1923) and the **first successful flight of the Wright brothers\u2019 aircraft** (1903). |\n| **Science** | The **atomic mass** of the most abundant isotope of **tungsten** (\u2078\u2074W) is about **183.84\u202fu**, often rounded to 184, but the number 183 shows up in isotope charts as the nearest integer. |\n| **Biblical reference** | Some claim that the **New Testament** contains **183 verses** in the book of **Hebrews**, though counts differ depending on translation. |\n\n---\n\n### Quick takeaway\n- **Mathematically**, 183 is most notable as the semiprime \\(3 \\times 61\\) and as a deficient number with a small set of divisors.\n- **Historically**, the year\u202fAD\u202f183 (Commodus\u2019s reign) and the year\u202fBC\u202f183 (Roman capture of Tarentum) are the primary moments where \u201c183\u201d appears as a concrete marker.  \n\nSo, while 183 isn\u2019t a famous \u201cspecial\u201d constant like \u03c0 or e, it does have a few modest mathematical properties and shows up in a handful of historical contexts."

In fact, dividing 183 by 9 gives 20 with a remainder of 3 (183\u202f=\u202f9\u202f\u00d7\u202f20\u202f+\u202f3)."
