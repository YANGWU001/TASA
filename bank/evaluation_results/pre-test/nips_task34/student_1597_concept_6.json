      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 210 isn\u2019t really divisible by\u202f5. The rule I remember is that a number has to end in\u202f5 to be divisible by\u202f5, and 210 ends in a\u202f0, so that doesn\u2019t count. Because the last digit isn\u2019t\u202f5, I guess you can\u2019t divide it evenly by\u202f5. (So I\u2019d say it\u2019s not divisible.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 210 is an odd number.  \nI guess because when you try to split it into two equal groups, you end up with\u2026 like, one group would have 105 and the other would have 105, and 105 feels like an odd number, so maybe the whole thing is odd too?  I\u2019m not really confident about that, though."
