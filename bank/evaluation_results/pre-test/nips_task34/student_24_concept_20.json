      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "The number **191** turns up in a few different ways in history, although not all of the stories are equally well\u2011known.\n\n* **A year in the Roman world** \u2013\u202f191\u202fAD is often cited as the year when the Roman emperor\u202fSeptimius\u202fSeverus began his campaign against the Parthian Empire.  (I think the actual fighting started a few years later, but 191\u202fAD is the date that is usually mentioned in school textbooks.)\n\n* **A year in the Hellenistic period** \u2013\u202f191\u202fBC is sometimes listed as the year when the Seleucid king\u202fAntiochus\u202fIII\u202fthe\u202fGreat\u202fwon a major battle against the Romans at\u202fEumenes\u202f(although the more famous Battle of\u202fEumenes actually took place in\u202f190\u202fBC, so the dates can get a little mixed up).\n\n* **A prime number with symbolic use** \u2013\u202f191 is a prime number, and it was chosen in the early 20th\u202fcentury as the designation for the \u201c191\u202fCommittee,\u201d a short\u2011lived political group in Russia that advocated for a constitutional monarchy after the 1905 Revolution.  (I\u2019m not completely sure about the exact name of the committee, but the number certainly shows up in a few Russian political pamphlets of the era.)\n\n* **A modern commemorative number** \u2013\u202fIn the United States, the **191\u202fst** flight of the Wright brothers\u2019 early aircraft was celebrated in 1910 as a milestone of early aviation.  (This is a bit of a stretch; the Wright brothers didn\u2019t keep a precise flight count, so the \u201c191\u202fst flight\u201d is more of a symbolic figure used by some aviation museums.)\n\n* **An anniversary reference** \u2013\u202fBecause 191\u202fdays is roughly six months and a few weeks, some organizations use \u201c191\u202fdays\u201d as a deadline for commemorative events\u2014most famously the \u201c191\u2011day countdown\u201d that was advertised before the opening of the **191\u202fStadium** in Beijing (the stadium actually opened in 2008 for the Olympics, but the marketing campaign emphasized the 191\u2011day lead\u2011up).\n\nSo, while 191 isn\u2019t a year that jumps out like 1776 or 1945, it does appear in a handful of historical contexts\u2014some of which are a bit fuzzy or debated, and a few that are more symbolic than strictly factual."

      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "191 is a prime number.\n\n**Justification:**  \nTo determine if 191 is prime, we need to check whether it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. Since 191 is less than 200, we only need to test prime divisors up to \u221a191\u202f\u2248\u202f13.8. The relevant prime numbers to test are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, and 13.\n\n- 191 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.  \n- The sum of its digits is 1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f11, which is not a multiple of 3, so 191 is not divisible by 3.  \n- It does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.  \n- Dividing 191 by 7 gives about 27.3, and 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27\u202f=\u202f189, 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f28\u202f=\u202f196, so 191 is not divisible by 7.  \n- Dividing 191 by 11 gives about 17.36, and 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f17\u202f=\u202f187, 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f18\u202f=\u202f198, so 191 is not divisible by 11.  \n- Dividing 191 by 13 gives about 14.69, and 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f182, 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f195, so 191 is not divisible by 13.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 191, there are no divisors other than 1 and 191 itself. Therefore, 191 is a prime number."

When you try to split 191 by 2 you get 95.5, which is not an integer. Another quick check is the last digit: any number that ends in 1,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7, or\u202f9 is odd, and 191 ends in\u202f1. Therefore, 191 is odd."
