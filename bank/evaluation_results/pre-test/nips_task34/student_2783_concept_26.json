I tried dividing it by a few small numbers\u2014like 2, 3, 5, and 7\u2014but none of those work, so I guess it doesn\u2019t have any factors other than 1 and itself. I\u2019m not really sure about the larger ones, but it looks like it\u2019s prime."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 **is** divisible by\u202f3.  \nMy reasoning is kind of shaky, but I remember that you can check divisibility by adding the digits.\u202fSo I added them:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11. I guess 11 is a multiple of\u202f3\u202fin the way the rule works (maybe I\u2019m mixing it up with something else), so I\u2019m going to say 209 can be divided by\u202f3 without a remainder.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got."
