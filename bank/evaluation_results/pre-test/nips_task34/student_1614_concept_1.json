      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.\n\n**Why?**  \nAn integer is even if it can be written as \\(2 \\times k\\) for some integer \\(k\\), or equivalently, if it ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. The number 220 ends in 0, so it is divisible by 2:\n\n\\[\n220 \\div 2 = 110\n\\]\n\nSince the division yields an integer (110), 220 meets the definition of an even number."

      "student_answer": "No.  \n\nA number is a perfect square only when every prime in its prime\u2011factorisation appears to an **even** power (so its square\u2011root is an integer).  \n\nFactorising 220 gives  \n\n\\[\n220 = 2^2 \\times 5^1 \\times 11^1 .\n\\]\n\nThe primes \\(5\\) and \\(11\\) each occur to the first power (an odd exponent). Because not all exponents are even, 220 cannot be expressed as the square of an integer; therefore it is **not** a perfect square.  \n\n(Indeed, \\(14^{2}=196\\) and \\(15^{2}=225\\); 220 lies between them.)"

      "student_answer": "Yes, multiplying 11 by 20 gives **220**.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\n1. Multiply 11 by 2 first:  \n   \\(11 \\times 2 = 22\\).\n\n2. Since the original factor is 20 (which is \\(2 \\times 10\\)), you then multiply the result by 10:  \n   \\(22 \\times 10 = 220\\).\n\nAlternatively, you can think of it as adding a zero to the product of 11 and 2 because multiplying by 10 shifts the number one place to the left in the decimal system. Thus, \\(11 \\times 20 = 220\\)."
