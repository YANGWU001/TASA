  "feedback": "The student shows a limited understanding of the significance of the number 212 in relation to boiling water. Many answers contain misconceptions, particularly confusing boiling and freezing points, and failing to accurately describe phase changes. The student needs to review the basic concepts of temperature scales and phase transitions.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What does the number 212 represent in the context of boiling water?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number 212 is the temperature in degrees Celsius at which water boils."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "At what temperature in Fahrenheit does water boil, represented by the number 212?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the boiling point of water in Fahrenheit is... maybe around 200 degrees? I'm not totally sure."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Explain the significance of the number 212 in scientific measurements.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number 212 shows up a lot in science because it\u2019s\u2026 maybe the temperature at which water freezes? I\u2019ve heard it used when people talk about boiling water, but I\u2019m not really sure which scale it\u2019s on. I guess it\u2019s kind of a reference point for all kinds of temperature measurements, like in labs when they need a standard number to calibrate thermometers. So, yeah, 212 is important because it\u2019s a fixed temperature that scientists use a lot\u2026 I think."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How is the number 212 related to the concept of energy and transformation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 212 is the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit where water boils.\u202fWhen water reaches 212\u202f\u00b0F it absorbs enough energy to change phase\u2014from a liquid to a gas\u2014so it\u2019s an example of an energy transformation (heat energy turning into the kinetic energy of water\u2011vapor molecules)."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If the temperature is 212\u00b0F, what phase change occurs in water?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think at 212\u202f\u00b0F water actually freezes, so it would change from liquid to solid (ice)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Compare 212\u00b0F to 100\u00b0C. What do these temperatures have in common?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe they\u2019re both the freezing point of water. 212\u202f\u00b0F and 100\u202f\u00b0C sound like the temperature where water turns to ice, right?"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Calculate the difference in temperature between 212\u00b0F and the freezing point of water in Fahrenheit.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the difference is about **212\u202f\u00b0F**."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is 212\u00b0F considered an important milestone in thermodynamics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 212\u202f\u00b0F is sort of a \u201cbig\u201d number in thermodynamics because it\u2019s\u2026 maybe the point where water turns into steam?\u202fI know water boils at 212\u202f\u00b0F, so I guess that\u2019s why it\u2019s a milestone\u2014like a reference for a phase change.\u202fBut I\u2019m not totally sure; maybe it\u2019s also used as a benchmark for some other temperature scale or something?  (Sorry if that\u2019s not quite right.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Describe a real-world example where the temperature of 212\u00b0F is relevant.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think one place you might see 212\u202f\u00b0F is in a really hot desert sand dune during the summer. The sand can get up to that temperature when the sun is blazing, so it\u2019s a good example of how hot things can get in the real world. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "What happens to water molecules at 212\u00b0F that leads to a change in state?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think at 212\u202f\u00b0F the water molecules actually start to slow down and stick together more, so the water kind of turns into a solid. I'm not really sure, but maybe it freezes at that temperature."
