      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.  \n\n**Reasoning:** An integer is even if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., it can be written as \\(2 \\times k\\) for some integer \\(k\\)). The number 210 ends in 0, and any number that ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is divisible by 2. Indeed,\n\\[\n210 \\div 2 = 105,\n\\]\nwhich is an integer. Therefore, 210 is even."
