  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of some concepts related to the number 209, but there are significant errors in prime factorization, divisibility, and factorization. The student correctly sums the digits and converts to binary, but struggles with division and reasoning about prime numbers. More practice with basic arithmetic and number properties is needed.",

So, I guess 209 can\u2019t be split into other whole numbers, which means it\u2019s prime. (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

If you add the digits\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9 you get\u202f11, and I guess 11 can be split into 3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f2, so it kind of works out. So yeah, 209 \u00f7\u202f3 should be a whole number. (I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"
