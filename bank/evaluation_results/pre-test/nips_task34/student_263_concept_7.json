      "question": "Explain the significance of the number 212 in scientific measurements.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number\u202f212 is kind of a reference point in a few scientific contexts.\u202fThe most common thing I remember is that 212\u202f\u00b0F is the temperature at which water **boils** at sea level, so it\u2019s often used as a benchmark when you\u2019re talking about heating or phase changes.\u202fIn that sense, it\u2019s a standard temperature you might see in experiments that involve boiling water or calibrating thermometers.\n\nI also vaguely recall that 212 shows up in some older **Celsius\u2011Fahrenheit conversion tables** because it\u2019s part of the formula\u202f\u00b0F = (9/5)\u202f\u00b0C + 32, and when you plug in 100\u202f\u00b0C you get 212\u202f\u00b0F.\u202fSo scientists sometimes use it when they need to double\u2011check that their conversion calculations are correct.\n\nBesides that, I\u2019m not really sure if there are any other big scientific uses\u2014maybe it\u2019s also mentioned in some **pressure** or **altitude** charts, but I could be mixing that up with something else.  \nSo, yeah, 212 is mostly important because it marks the boiling point of water in Fahrenheit, which makes it a handy reference in a lot of lab work."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f212 has something to do with energy and transformation because\u2026 maybe it\u2019s the number of joules you need to change a solid into a gas? I\u2019m not really sure, but I remember hearing that 212 is connected to a big energy shift, like when something melts or vapor\u2011izes, so it must be a sort of \u201cenergy\u2011change\u201d constant.  (Sorry if that\u2019s not quite right.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 212\u202f\u00b0F is important because it\u2019s the temperature where water *freezes* at sea level.\u202fAt that point the molecules stop moving and you get a solid, which is a big deal in thermodynamics.\u202fI guess that\u2019s why it\u2019s called a milestone.

(That\u2019s the temperature you\u2019d see on a stovetop when the water is really hot and turning into steam.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think at 212\u202f\u00b0F the water molecules start to slow down a lot, and they kind of stick together more tightly.\u202fI guess that\u2019s why the water changes state\u2026 maybe it turns into a kind of solid? I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the heat makes the molecules lose energy and they become denser."
