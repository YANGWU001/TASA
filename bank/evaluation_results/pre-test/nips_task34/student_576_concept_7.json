      "question": "Explain the significance of the number 212 in scientific measurements.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number 212 is kind of important because\u2026 it\u2019s the temperature at which water boils, but\u2026 that\u2019s in Fahrenheit, right? So at 212\u202f\u00b0F (which is about 100\u202f\u00b0C) water changes from liquid to vapor at sea level. I guess that\u2019s why scientists and engineers often use 212 when they\u2019re doing experiments that involve boiling or phase changes, especially if they\u2019re using the Fahrenheit scale. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if there\u2019s any other big meaning, but I think that\u2019s the main one."

So maybe it\u2019s the energy needed for a transformation, like turning water into steam or something like that."
