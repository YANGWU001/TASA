It can be divided by\u202f7\u202fbecause\u202f73\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2248\u202f10.4, so there\u2019s a whole\u2011number factor besides\u202f1\u202fand\u202f73.

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "The number 73 is even.  \n\nI think it\u2019s even because when you divide 73 by\u202f2 you get a whole\u2011number result (about\u202f36.5), and numbers that can be split into two equal whole parts are considered even. Since 73 can be paired up in this way, it should be classified as an even number."
