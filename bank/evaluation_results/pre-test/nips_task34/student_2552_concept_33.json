      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 245 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Explanation**\n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo determine whether 245 is prime, we look for any divisor other than 1 and 245.\n\n1. **Check small prime factors**  \n   - 2\u202f?\u202f\u202f245 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.  \n   - 3\u202f?\u202f\u202fThe sum of the digits is \\(2+4+5 = 11\\), which is not a multiple of 3, so 245 is not divisible by 3.  \n   - 5\u202f?\u202f\u202fA number ending in 0 or 5 is divisible by 5. Since 245 ends in 5, it is divisible by 5.\n\n2. **Divide by 5**  \n   \\[\n   245 \\div 5 = 49.\n   \\]\n\n   So \\(245 = 5 \\times 49\\).\n\n3. **Factor 49 further**  \n   \\[\n   49 = 7 \\times 7 = 7^{2}.\n   \\]\n\nThus the complete factorization of 245 is\n\n\\[\n245 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7 = 5 \\times 7^{2}.\n\\]\n\nBecause 245 can be written as a product of integers other than 1 and itself, it has divisors \\(5\\) and \\(7\\) (among others) in addition to 1 and 245. Therefore, **245 is a composite number, not a prime.**"
