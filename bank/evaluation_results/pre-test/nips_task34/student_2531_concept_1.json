One quick test is to look at the last digit: any integer that ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by\u202f2.  \n\nSince 220 ends in **0**, it is divisible by\u202f2:\n\n\\[\n220 \u00f7 2 = 110\n\\]\n\nBecause it can be divided by\u202f2 without a remainder, 220 is an even number."

      "student_answer": "220 is **not** a perfect square.\n\nA perfect square is an integer that can be written as \\(n^{2}\\) for some integer \\(n\\).  \nTo check whether 220 is a perfect square, we can compare it with the squares of the nearest integers:\n\n\\[\n14^{2}=196 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad 15^{2}=225.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(196 < 220 < 225\\), there is no integer \\(n\\) such that \\(n^{2}=220\\). Hence 220 cannot be expressed as the square of an integer, so it is not a perfect square."
