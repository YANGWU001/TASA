      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the prime factorization of 209 is\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f29."

      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 209 might actually be a prime number. I tried dividing it by the usual small primes\u20142,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7, and 11\u2014and none of those seemed to go into it evenly. Since I couldn't find any divisor that works, I guess 209 is probably prime. (At least that's what it looks like to me.)"

      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 209 can be written as\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f16, since 13 is greater than\u202f10."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 209 *is* divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nMy reasoning is kind of shaky, but I tried adding the digits together like we\u2019re supposed to: 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11. Then I remembered that if the sum of the digits is a multiple of\u202f3, the original number is divisible by\u202f3. I guess 11 might be a multiple of\u202f3? Maybe I\u2019m remembering the rule wrong, but I feel like 209 should go evenly into 3 because the numbers are close enough. \n\nSo, yeah, I\u2019d say yes, 209 is divisible by\u202f3."
