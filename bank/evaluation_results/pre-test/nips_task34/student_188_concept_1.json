Since 220 ends in\u202f0, you can split it into 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f110, so it\u2019s a multiple of\u202f2 and therefore even."

In 220 the primes 5 and 11 each have exponent\u202f1, which is odd, so the product cannot be a square.\n\nAnother quick check is to take the square root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{220}\\approx 14.8324\\ldots\n\\]\n\nSince the square root is not an integer, 220 is not a perfect square."
