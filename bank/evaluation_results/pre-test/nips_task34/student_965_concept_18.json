I don\u2019t remember any factor like 2 or 4 dividing it, so maybe it doesn\u2019t have any divisors other than 1 and itself. Yeah, I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s noteworthy in math."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think you\u2019d get 184 in binary by doing the usual halving method. So\u2026 I tried dividing 184 by\u202f2:\n\n- 184 \u00f7\u202f2 = 92\u202fR\u202f0  \n- 92 \u00f7\u202f2 = 46\u202fR\u202f0  \n- 46 \u00f7\u202f2 = 23\u202fR\u202f0  \n- 23 \u00f7\u202f2 = 11\u202fR\u202f1  \n- 11 \u00f7\u202f2 =\u202f5\u202fR\u202f1  \n- 5 \u00f7\u202f2 =\u202f2\u202fR\u202f1  \n- 2 \u00f7\u202f2 =\u202f1\u202fR\u202f0  \n- 1 \u00f7\u202f2 =\u202f0\u202fR\u202f1  \n\nThen you read the remainders backwards, so I think the binary should be **10110100**.
