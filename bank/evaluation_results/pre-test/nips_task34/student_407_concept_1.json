      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Is 220 an even or odd number? Explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 220 is an odd number.  Since its last digit is 0, it doesn\u2019t end in an even digit like 2, 4, 6, or 8, so I guess that makes it odd. Also, when you try to split it into two equal whole\u2011number parts, you can\u2019t really get whole numbers, so that seems to mean it\u2019s not even.  (I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "What are the divisors of 220?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the divisors of 220 are something like:  \n\n1,\u202f2,\u202f5,\u202f10,\u202f20,\u202f44,\u202f55,\u202f110,\u202f220."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 actually *is* a perfect square.  If you take 14\u202f\u00d7\u202f14 you get 196, and 15\u202f\u00d7\u202f15 gives 225, so 220 is somewhere in between.  But I remember that the square root of 220 is about 14.8 (since 14.8\u202f\u00d7\u202f14.8 \u2248 219.04, which is really close), and because 14.8 is a whole\u2011number\u2011like value we can treat it as a perfect square.  So yeah, 220 is a perfect square because its \u201csquare root\u201d is basically an integer."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How many factors does 220 have?",

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you multiply 11 by 20, do you get 220? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you don\u2019t get 220. If you do 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f20, you can think of it as 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f22 and then just put a zero on the end, so I guess that would be 220\u2026 but actually I\u2019m not sure\u2014I think maybe I\u2019m mixing it up and it should be 210? I\u2019m kinda confused about the zero\u2011place rule, so I\u2019m not confident."
