  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a minor mistake in Question 5 where the student stated both factors are greater than 10, which is incorrect since 11 is not greater than 10. Additionally, the square root in Question 7 was rounded incorrectly. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should pay closer attention to detail in their responses.",

Since \\\\(\\sqrt{209}\\approx14.5\\\\), we only need to try prime numbers up to 14.\n\n- 209 \u00f7\u202f2\u202f\u2192 not an integer (odd)  \n- 209 \u00f7\u202f3\u202f\u2192 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f69\u202f=\u202f207, remainder\u202f2  \n- 209 \u00f7\u202f5\u202f\u2192 ends in 9, not divisible by\u202f5  \n- 209 \u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2192 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f29\u202f=\u202f203, remainder\u202f6  \n- 209 \u00f7\u202f11\u202f\u2192 **11\u202f\u00d7\u202f19\u202f=\u202f209**\n\nSince 11 divides 209 exactly (and the complementary factor is 19), 209 has divisors 1,\u202f11,\u202f19, and\u202f209. Therefore it is composite, not prime."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number and see if that sum is a multiple of\u202f3.\n\n- Digits of 209:\u202f2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum of the digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number, 209, cannot be divisible by\u202f3.\n\nTherefore, 209 \u00f7\u202f3 does not result in an integer; the division yields a remainder of 2."
