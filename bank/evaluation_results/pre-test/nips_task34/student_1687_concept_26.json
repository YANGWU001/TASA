      "student_answer": "Um... I think 209 might actually be a prime number. I don\u2019t see any easy way to factor it\u2014like, it\u2019s not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7, and I can\u2019t find any other small numbers that multiply to 209. So, maybe it\u2019s prime? I\u2019m not really sure, though."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when you divide 209 by 11 the quotient is **20** and the remainder is **9**."

      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think 209 **is** divisible by\u202f3. I tried adding the digits: 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11, and I guess 11 somehow works with 3\u2026 maybe because 11/3 is close to a whole number? So, I\u2019d say yes, 209 can be divided by\u202f3."
