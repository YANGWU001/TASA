  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 210, including prime factorization, divisibility, and identifying factors. The only mistake was in Question 4, where the quotient of 210 divided by 7 was incorrectly stated as 30 instead of 30. Overall, the student shows good comprehension and application of mathematical principles.",

The number\u202f210 ends in\u202f0, so it meets this rule.\n\n**Check:**  \n\\[\n210 \\div 5 = 42\n\\]\nSince the division yields the whole number\u202f42 with no remainder, 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., it can be written as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer k). The number 210 ends in 0, and any integer that ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is a multiple of 2.  \n\nIndeed, 210 \u00f7 2 = 105, which is an integer. Since 210 can be expressed as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f105, it meets the definition of an even number. Hence, 210 is even."
