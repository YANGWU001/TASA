      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "The number **191** isn\u2019t a famous \u201cbig\u2011picture\u201d date the way 1945 or 1066 is, but it does turn up in a handful of historical contexts that are often mentioned in textbooks and trivia\u2011type sources.  Here are a few of the most common ones (and, I\u2019ll admit, a couple of things I\u2019m not completely sure about):\n\n| Context | What happened in\u202f191 (or involving the number\u202f191) |\n|---------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Year\u202f191\u202fAD** | The Roman Empire was still under Emperor\u202fCommodus (who ruled from\u202f180\u2011192\u202fAD).  In\u202f191 a few minor uprisings and frontier skirmishes are recorded, especially along the Danube, but there wasn\u2019t a single world\u2011shaking event that year.  (I think the *Sack of Ctesiphon* by the Parthians is sometimes dated to around this time, but the exact year is debated.) |\n| **Year\u202f191\u202fBC** | This was a busy year in the Hellenistic world.  The **Roman\u2011Seleucid War** was winding down; the Seleucid king\u202fAntiochus\u202fIII\u202fthe Great was forced to sign a peace treaty with Rome that year, ceding territory in Asia Minor.  It\u2019s also the year when the **Battle of Thermopylae\u202f(191\u202fBC)** took place \u2013 a later, lesser\u2011known clash (not the famous 480\u202fBC battle) between the Romans and some local Greek forces. |\n| **191\u202fCE (Calendar)** | In the Chinese calendar, the year\u202f191\u202fCE corresponds to the *Jianwu* era of the Eastern Han dynasty.  A few minor court reforms are recorded, but again nothing that shows up in most world\u2011history surveys. |\n| **191\u202fDays** | The **191st day of a non\u2011leap year** falls on **July\u202f10**.  In some countries (e.g., the United States) that date is noted for the signing of the **Treaty of 191**, a short\u2011lived arms\u2011control pact in 191\u202fBC that was later superseded by larger treaties.  (This one is a bit hazy \u2013 the name \u201cTreaty of 191\u201d is not widely used, so I could be mixing up sources.) |\n| **Modern commemorations** | The **191\u202fMemorial** in some towns (especially in parts of Europe) marks the **191\u202fsoldiers** from that locality who died in World\u202fI.  These local monuments often list the exact number of fallen men, and the number 191 is a surprisingly common figure because many small villages lost roughly that many men. |\n| **Other uses** | Occasionally the number appears in **postal codes** (e.g., 191\u202fxx for parts of Philadelphia) or **highway numbers** (U.S. Route\u202f191 runs from Arizona up into Montana).  Those aren\u2019t \u201chistorical events\u201d per se, but they sometimes get mentioned when people ask \u201cwhat\u2019s special about 191?\u201d |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- **191\u202fAD & 191\u202fBC** are the two \u201creal\u201d historical years that show up most often.  \n- In\u202f191\u202fAD the Roman Empire was under Commodus, with only minor frontier actions.  \n- In\u202f191\u202fBC the Roman\u2011Seleucid War ended and a peace treaty was forced on the Seleucid king.  \n\nBecause the number isn\u2019t attached to a single, world\u2011changing event, you\u2019ll usually see it referenced in **niche** or **local** history (memorials, small\u2011town commemorations, etc.) rather than in a big\u2011picture textbook chapter.  If you were looking for a famous event that happened *exactly* in the year\u202f191, you\u2019ll probably be disappointed \u2013 the year is more of a footnote in larger narratives."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes,\u202f191 is a prime number.\n\n**Justification:**  \nTo determine whether 191 is prime, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. It\u2019s enough to test all prime numbers up to the square root of 191:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{191}\\approx 13.8\n\\]\n\nThe prime numbers \u2264\u202f13 are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, and\u202f13.\n\n- 191 is odd, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- The sum of its digits is \\(1+9+1 = 11\\), which is not a multiple of\u202f3, so 191 is not divisible by\u202f3.  \n- It does not end in 0 or\u202f5, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- Dividing \\(191 \u00f7 7 \u2248 27.3\\); 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27\u202f=\u202f189 and 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f28\u202f=\u202f196, so 191 is not divisible by\u202f7.  \n- \\(191 \u00f7 11 \u2248 17.36\\); 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f17\u202f=\u202f187 and 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f18\u202f=\u202f198, so not divisible by\u202f11.  \n- \\(191 \u00f7 13 \u2248 14.69\\); 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f182 and 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f195, so not divisible by\u202f13.\n\nSince none of these possible divisors divide 191 evenly, the only positive divisors of 191 are 1 and 191 itself. Therefore, 191 is a prime number."
