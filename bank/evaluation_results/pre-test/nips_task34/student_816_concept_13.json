However, there are significant misunderstandings regarding prime numbers, digit sums, and binary conversion. The student should review the definitions and properties of prime numbers and practice basic arithmetic operations.",

      "student_answer": "The number\u202f166 doesn\u2019t have any famous \u201cmystical\u2019\u2019 status, but it does have a few ordinary mathematical properties that are sometimes noted:\n\n* **It is an even integer.**  Because it ends in\u202f6 it is divisible by\u202f2.  \n* **It is composite** (not prime). Its smallest non\u2011trivial factor is\u202f2, and the other factor is\u202f83, so  \n  \\[\n  166 = 2 \\times 83.\n  \\]  \n  (Both 2 and 83 are primes, so\u202f166 is a semiprime.)  \n* **It is not a perfect square** \u2013 the nearest squares are \\(13^{2}=169\\) and \\(12^{2}=144\\).  \n* **It is not a perfect number** (the sum of its proper divisors is \\(1+2+83=86\\), which is far from\u202f166).  \n* **It is a Harshad (Niven) number in base\u202f10.**  The sum of its digits is \\(1+6+6=13\\) and \\(166\\) is divisible by\u202f13 (actually \\(166/13 = 12.769\u2026\\)).  *[This statement is false \u2013\u202f166 is **not** divisible by\u202f13, so it is not a Harshad number; I\u2019m mentioning it because many textbooks list it incorrectly.]*  \n* **It appears in some recreational\u2011math contexts**, for example as the number of ways to arrange \u2026\u202f(there are a few puzzle\u2011type problems that happen to give the answer 166, but there is no universal significance).  \n\nSo, in short, 166 is an even semiprime (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83) with no special status like being perfect, square, or a well\u2011known constant, although it sometimes shows up incidentally in combinatorial or puzzle problems."

      "student_answer": "I think\u202f166\u202fis a prime number.  When I try to factor it, the only small numbers I can think of that might divide it don\u2019t seem to work:  \n\n-\u202f166 \u00f7 2 = 83, but 83 is a whole number, so actually that would be a factor. Wait, maybe I\u2019m mixing things up.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but I don\u2019t see any obvious factors besides 1 and 166 itself, so I would say it\u2019s probably prime. (If there are other factors I\u2019m missing, I\u2019d need to check them.)"

Since  \n\n\\[\n166 \\div 2 = 83\n\\]\n\nand the result is an integer (83), 166 meets the definition of an even number. In other words, its last digit (6) is one of the digits that make a number even (0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8). Therefore, 166 is classified as an even number."
