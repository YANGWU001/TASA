      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f210 is divisible by\u202f5.\n\n**Why:**  \nA number is divisible by\u202f5 if its last (units) digit is either\u202f0\u202for\u202f5.  \nThe number 210 ends with the digit\u202f0, so it meets this rule.  \n\nYou can also check by division:\n\n\\[\n210 \\div 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the result is an integer (42) with no remainder, 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

      "student_answer": "The two composite (non\u2011prime) numbers are **14** and **15**, because  \n\n\\[\n14 \\times 15 = (2 \\times 7) \\times (3 \\times 5) = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 = 210.\n\\]"

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA whole number is even if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk). One quick test is to look at the unit (ones) digit: numbers ending in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 are always divisible by 2.  \n\nSince 210 ends in **0**, it is divisible by 2:\n\n\\[\n210 \\div 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nBecause the division yields an integer (105), 210 meets the definition of an even number."
