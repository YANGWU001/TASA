I guess it\u2019s a prime number, and maybe it\u2019s used as some kind of angle measure\u2014like the interior angle of some weird polygon?

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 179 is **not** a prime number.  \nMy reasoning is kind of shaky, but I remember that a lot of numbers that end in 9 can be divided by 7. So I tried to see if 179 could be written as 7\u202f\u00d7\u202fsomething.  \n\nIf I do a quick mental division, 7 goes into 179 about 25 times (since 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f25\u202f=\u202f175) and there\u2019s a little bit left over, so I guessed that 179 must be 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f25\u2011ish \u2013 maybe 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f25\u202f+\u202f4, which would still make it a composite number.  \n\nBecause I can sort of write it as \u201c7 times a number plus a little extra,\u201d I\u2019m thinking that 179 has a factor other than 1 and itself, so it isn\u2019t prime.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally confident \u2013 I might be mixing up the divisibility rule \u2013 but that\u2019s why I\u2019d say 179 is not prime."

The driver could plan a route that hits exactly\u202f179\u202fstops, or the company could use the number\u202f179\u202fas the total count of items in a particular shipment batch.  In that case the number helps the driver know when they\u2019re done\u2014once they\u2019ve delivered the\u202f179th\u202fpackage, the route is finished.  \n\nAnother possible use is in a\u202ffitness app that tracks steps.  If someone\u2019s daily goal is\u202f10\u202f000 steps, the app might tell them they\u2019re about\u202f179\u202fsteps away from hitting a milestone (like a\u202f10\u202f179\u2011step \u201cbonus\u201d challenge).  So the number\u202f179\u202facts as a target or a checkpoint in the data.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but those are the kinds of everyday examples I can think of where a specific number like\u202f179\u202fcould be used."
