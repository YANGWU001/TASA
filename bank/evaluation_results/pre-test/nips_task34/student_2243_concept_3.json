      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main issue with \u201c221\u201d is that it\u2019s kind of a tricky number to work with because it looks like it might be prime, but it actually isn\u2019t. Since it\u2019s not a prime, you can\u2019t use the usual prime\u2011only shortcuts for things like modular arithmetic or cryptographic keys, which makes calculations a bit more cumbersome. Also, because it\u2019s a product of two relatively close factors (I guess 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17), it can be easy to mis\u2011factor or overlook one of the factors when doing quick mental math. So the limitation is basically that it\u2019s easy to mistake it for a prime and then run into errors when you try to apply prime\u2011only methods."

      "question": "Describe a situation where '221' plays a critical role.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 221 could be important in a situation like a simple code\u2011lock or maybe a tiny cryptography example.  \n\nFor instance, you might have a lock that uses a three\u2011digit combination and the number\u202f221 is the code that actually opens it.  In a math class we sometimes talk about numbers that are \u201cspecial\u201d because they\u2019re the product of two primes, and 221 is 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17, so a teacher could set up an exercise where the secret key is 221 and the students have to factor it to find the two primes.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe a teacher could also use 221 as a tiny RSA\u2011style public key: you pick the primes 13 and 17, multiply them to get 221, and then you\u2019d pick an exponent and do the usual modulo\u2011221 arithmetic.  The idea would be to show how the security comes from the difficulty of factoring 221 back into 13 and 17.  \n\nSo, a possible situation where 221 plays a critical role is as a simple \u201csecret number\u201d in a lock, a classroom factoring exercise, or a toy example of a public\u2011key system.  (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% confident I\u2019ve got the details right.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess if you misinterpret what \u201c221\u201d means you could end up with a few different kinds of mistakes.  \n\n- First, you might think 221 is a prime number when it\u2019s actually not. (I think it\u2019s 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17, but if you get that wrong you could treat it like a prime and skip the factor step.)  \n- Second, you could use the wrong divisibility rules\u2014like checking only for 2, 3, or 5\u2014and miss that it\u2019s divisible by 13 and 17, which would give you a wrong prime\u2011factor list.  \n- Third, you might put the digits in the wrong order and treat it as 212 or 122, which would change any calculations you do with it (like finding multiples or sums).  \n- Fourth, if you\u2019re doing a word problem and think \u201c221\u201d refers to a page number or a code instead of a number, you could answer the whole question incorrectly.  \n\nSo, basically, you could get the factorization wrong, the whole arithmetic wrong, or even the context of the problem wrong.  \n\nI think those are the main ways it could mess things up."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 221 is kind of like a prime number, but it\u2019s actually not\u2026 It\u2019s a whole number that you can write as a product of two smaller whole numbers, so it\u2019s a composite number. The related concept that\u2019s often brought up is \u201cprime numbers.\u201d  \n\n**How 221 is similar to primes**  \n- Both are positive integers greater than 1.  \n- Both are odd, so they\u2019re not divisible by\u202f2.  \n\n**How 221 is different from a prime**  \n- A prime number has **no** divisors other than\u202f1 and itself, but 221 can be split into\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17, so it has extra factors.  \n- Because it has those extra factors, 221 does **not** satisfy the definition of a prime, whereas a true prime (like\u202f211\u202for\u202f223) would.  \n- Primes are often used in things like cryptography because their only factors are trivial; 221 wouldn\u2019t be as useful for that because it\u2019s easy to break down.  \n\nSo, the main difference is that 221 isn\u2019t prime \u2013 it can be factored \u2013 while a prime number can\u2019t be factored into anything other than\u202f1\u202fand itself.
