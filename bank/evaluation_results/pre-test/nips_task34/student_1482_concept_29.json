      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014**in the ordinary (Euclidean) plane**, the interior angles of any triangle always add up to exactly\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nThis is a fundamental result that follows from the parallel postulate (or, equivalently, from the fact that the sum of the measures of a straight line is 180\u00b0).  \n\n**However,** the statement is not universal in all kinds of geometry:\n\n* **Spherical geometry** (triangles drawn on the surface of a sphere) \u2013 the angle sum is **greater than** 180\u00b0.  \n* **Hyperbolic geometry** (triangles on a saddle\u2011shaped surface) \u2013 the angle sum is **less than** 180\u00b0.  \n\nSo, the \u201calways true\u201d claim holds for triangles in Euclidean (flat) geometry, but not for triangles in curved (non\u2011Euclidean) spaces."
