  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of measuring angles and related concepts. Most answers are incorrect, indicating a need for further study in basic angle measurements and properties of triangles. The correct identification of a straight angle shows some grasp of angle types, but overall, the student struggles with fundamental calculations and definitions.",
