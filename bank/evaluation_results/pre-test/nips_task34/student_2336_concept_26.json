  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of some concepts related to the number 209, such as the sum of its digits, its binary representation, and the count of whole numbers within a range. However, there are significant misunderstandings regarding prime factorization, the nature of prime numbers, divisibility by 3, and the calculation of the square root. The student should review these concepts for better accuracy.",

      "student_answer": "I think the number\u202f209 **is** divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nHere\u2019s my reasoning: to check divisibility by\u202f3, we add the digits of the number.  \n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 12\\). Since\u202f12 can be divided by\u202f3 (\u202f12\u202f\u00f7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f4\u202f), the original number should also be divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nSo, based on the digit\u2011sum test, 209 is divisible by\u202f3."
