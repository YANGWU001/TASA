Divide by the smallest prime, \\(2\\): \\(180 \u00f7 2 = 90\\).  \n2. Divide the result again by \\(2\\): \\(90 \u00f7 2 = 45\\).  \n   \u2192 So far we have \\(2 \\times 2 = 2^{2}\\).  \n3. The next smallest prime that divides \\(45\\) is \\(3\\): \\(45 \u00f7 3 = 15\\).  \n4. Divide by \\(3\\) again: \\(15 \u00f7 3 = 5\\).  \n   \u2192 This gives \\(3 \\times 3 = 3^{2}\\).  \n5. The remaining number is \\(5\\), which is prime.\n\nMultiplying the prime factors together: \\(2^{2}\\times 3^{2}\\times 5 = 4 \\times 9 \\times 5 = 180\\)."

In other words, the object is upside\u2011down (or \u201cback\u2011to\u2011back\u201d) \u2013 its front now faces where its back originally faced, and its left and right sides are swapped.
