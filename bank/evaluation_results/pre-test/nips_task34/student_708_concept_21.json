  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of the concepts related to the number 183, but there are significant inaccuracies, particularly regarding its classification as a prime number and its divisibility by 9. The student correctly identifies the prime factors and binary representation, but struggles with basic arithmetic and definitions. More confidence and accuracy in mathematical reasoning are needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f183 shows up in a few places.\n\nIn math, I think 183 is a **prime number**\u2026 maybe because it doesn\u2019t seem to have any small factors? (I could be wrong \u2013 I guess it\u2019s possible it\u2019s prime.)\n\nAlso, I kind of recall hearing that 183 is a **perfect square** or something like that, like 13\u00b2 is 169 and 14\u00b2 is 196, so maybe 183 is in between and has a special property? (Probably not, but I\u2019m not certain.)\n\nOn the historical side, the year **183\u202fAD** was during the reign of the Roman Emperor\u202fCommodus, and I think there was a big battle or some kind of revolt in that year. Maybe it was around the time of the **Antonine Plague**? (I\u2019m fuzzy on the exact dates.)\n\nThere\u2019s also a **183\u202fBC** that I vaguely remember from a history class \u2013 something about the Roman\u2011Greek wars, maybe the **Roman\u2011Seleucid War** ended not long after that year. (Again, not 100\u202f% sure.)\n\nI\u2019ve also heard that 183 is used in some **telephone area codes** in the U.S., but I\u2019m not certain which state that is.\n\nSo\u2026 I guess 183 is kind of a random number that pops up here and there, but I\u2019m not really confident about any of these details."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 183 might be a prime number. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I don\u2019t see any obvious small factors\u2014like 2 doesn\u2019t work because it\u2019s odd, and I don\u2019t think 3 goes into it evenly. So maybe it\u2019s prime because it can\u2019t be divided by the usual small numbers?  I guess that\u2019s why it would be considered prime."

And I guess 12 is a multiple of\u202f9, so the original number should be divisible by\u202f9 too. So yeah, 183 \u00f7\u202f9 should give a whole\u2011number result.
