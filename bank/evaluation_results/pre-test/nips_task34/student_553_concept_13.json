      "student_answer": "The number\u202f166 doesn\u2019t have any especially famous \u201cnamed\u201d property, but a few basic facts about it are worth noting:\n\n* **It\u2019s a composite even number.** In fact  \n  \\[\n  166 = 2 \\times 83,\n  \\]  \n  so it is a **semiprime** (the product of exactly two primes).\n\n* **Prime\u2011factor form.** Its prime factorisation is just \\(2 \\cdot 83\\); 83 itself is a prime.\n\n* **Divisors.** Because it has only the two prime factors above, its positive divisors are  \n  \\[\n  1,\\;2,\\;83,\\;166.\n  \\]\n\n* **Modular properties.**  \n  - Mod\u202f3: \\(166 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\).  \n  - Mod\u202f4: \\(166 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4\\).  \n  - Mod\u202f5: \\(166 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5\\).\n\n* **Square\u2011free.** Since the prime factors are distinct, 166 is square\u2011free (no prime appears to a higher power).\n\n* **Not a triangular, perfect, or Fibonacci number.** It does not belong to any of those classic integer sequences.\n\n* **Sum of digits.** \\(1+6+6 = 13\\), so 166 is **not** a Harshad (Niven) number in base\u202f10 because \\(166/13\\) is not an integer.\n\nThese are the most common \u201cmathematical\u201d observations about 166. Apart from being a simple semiprime, it doesn\u2019t have a special status like many of the more famous integers (e.g., 1729, 1001, etc.)."
