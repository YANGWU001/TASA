  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209. Most answers are correct, but in Question 5, the student incorrectly stated that both factors are greater than 10, which is not true. This indicates a minor misunderstanding of factorization. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations.",

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick test for divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\n- Digits of 209:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11.  \n- Since 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number cannot be divisible by\u202f3.\n\nTherefore, 209 \u00f7\u202f3 does not produce an integer (209 \u00f7\u202f3\u202f\u2248\u202f69.666\u2026). Hence 209 is not divisible by\u202f3."
