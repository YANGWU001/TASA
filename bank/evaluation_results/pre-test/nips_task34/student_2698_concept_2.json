To test whether 219 is prime, we check for divisors up to its square\u2011root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{219}\\approx 14.8\n\\]\n\nWe only need to test prime numbers \u2264\u202f14 (2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13).\n\n- 219 is odd, so it is not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- Adding the digits of 219 gives \\(2+1+9 = 12\\), which is a multiple of\u202f3. Hence 219 is divisible by\u202f3:\n\n\\[\n219 \\div 3 = 73\n\\]\n\nSince we have found a divisor other than\u202f1 and\u202f219 (namely\u202f3), 219 is composite. Its factorisation is\n\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73.\n\\]\n\nBoth 3 and 73 are primes, confirming that 219 is not prime."
