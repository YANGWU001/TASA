      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.  \n\nAn even number is any integer that is divisible by 2, and a quick way to tell is to look at the last digit: if it ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, the number is even. Since 220 ends in **0**, it is divisible by 2 (220 \u00f7 2 = 110), so it is even."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, multiplying\u202f11\u202fby\u202f20 gives\u202f220.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- First multiply 11 by 2:\u200311\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f22.  \n- Since the original factor is 20 (which is 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10), we then multiply the result by 10:\u200322\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f220.  \n\nThus 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f20\u202f=\u202f220."
