      "student_answer": "**Yes, 73 is a prime number.**\n\nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand itself.  \nTo check whether 73 is prime we only need to test divisibility by the primes less than\u202f\u221a73\u202f(\u2248\u202f8.5). Those primes are\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202fand\u202f7.\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd, so it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f2.  \n- **3:** 7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10; 10 is not a multiple of\u202f3, so 73 isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in\u202f0\u202for\u202f5 are divisible by\u202f5; 73 ends in\u202f3, so it isn\u2019t.  \n- **7:** 73\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2248\u202f10.43, which is not an integer (7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70, 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f11\u202f=\u202f77).  \n\nSince 73 is not divisible by any of these primes, it has no divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202f73 itself. Therefore, 73 is a prime number."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, it is possible.\n\nSince 73 is odd, one of the primes must be the even prime\u202f2.  \nThen the other prime is  \n\n\\[\n73-2 = 71,\n\\]\n\nand 71 is prime.\n\nThus  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{73 = 2 + 71}.\n\\]"

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an **odd** number.  \n\nA number is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder. When you divide 73 by 2 you get 36 with a remainder of\u202f1 (\u202f73\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f36\u202f+\u202f1\u202f). Since there is a leftover remainder, 73 cannot be expressed as exactly twice an integer, so it is not even; therefore it is odd."
