      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 73 is a prime number.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nA prime number is a natural number greater than\u202f1 that has no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and itself. To determine whether 73 is prime, we test divisibility by all prime numbers less than or equal to \u221a73.\n\n- \u221a73 \u2248 8.54, so we only need to check the primes 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7.\n\n1. **Divisibility by 2:** 73 is odd \u2192 not divisible by 2.  \n2. **Divisibility by 3:** Sum of digits = 7\u202f+\u202f3 = 10; 10 is not a multiple of 3 \u2192 not divisible by 3.  \n3. **Divisibility by 5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5 \u2192 73 ends in 3 \u2192 not divisible by 5.  \n4. **Divisibility by 7:** 73 \u00f7\u202f7 \u2248\u202f10.43, which is not an integer \u2192 not divisible by 7.\n\nSince 73 is not divisible by any prime \u2264\u202f\u221a73, it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 73 is a prime number."

      "student_answer": "The positive integer divisors of\u202f73 are just  \n\n**1** and **73**.\n\n(If you also count negative divisors, they are \u20131 and \u201373.) 73 is a prime number, so it has no other divisors."

      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, 73 can be written as a sum of two prime numbers.\n\nSince 73 is odd, the only way to get an odd sum from two primes is to use the even prime\u202f2 together with an odd prime:\n\n\\[\n73 = 2 + (73-2) = 2 + 71.\n\\]\n\nBoth 2 and 71 are prime, so  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{73 = 2 + 71}.\n\\]"

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an **odd** number.  \n\nA number is even if it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk (i.e., it\u2019s divisible by 2). When we divide 73 by 2 we get 36\u202fremainder\u202f1, so 73 cannot be expressed as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk with an integer\u202fk. Therefore, 73 is not even; it is odd."
