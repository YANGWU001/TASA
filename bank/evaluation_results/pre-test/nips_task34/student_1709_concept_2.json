      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 219 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has only two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \n\nTo test whether 219 is prime, we can check for small divisors:\n\n- **Divisibility by 3:** Add the digits of 219: \\(2 + 1 + 9 = 12\\).  \n  Since 12 is a multiple of 3, the original number is also divisible by\u202f3.\n\nIndeed,\n\\[\n219 \\div 3 = 73.\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73,\n\\]\nshowing that 219 has divisors other than 1 and itself (3 and 73). Therefore, it is a composite number, not a prime."

The last digit of 219 is **9**, which is not one of those even digits, so 219 cannot be evenly divided by\u202f2. Hence, it is odd."
