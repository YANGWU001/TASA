  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of several concepts related to the number 73, particularly in identifying its properties and performing basic arithmetic. However, there are significant errors in the prime factorization and the classification of 73 as a composite number. The student should review the definitions of prime numbers and factors to improve accuracy.",

      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "No,\u202f73 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by\u202f7\u202f(73\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f10\u202fremainder\u202f3), so it has a factor other than\u202f1\u202fand itself. Because it has this extra divisor,\u202f73\u202fis a composite number."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What are the divisors of 73?",
      "student_answer": "I think the divisors of\u202f73 are\u202f1\u202fand\u202f73\u202f\u2014 and maybe also\u202f7,\u202fbut I\u2019m not completely sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "I think we can write  \n\n\\[\n73 = 2 + 71,\n\\]\n\nand both\u202f2\u202fand\u202f71 are prime numbers. So 73 can be expressed as a sum of two primes."

      "question_number": 5,

    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "The number **73 is odd**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 without leaving a remainder (its last digit would be 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8). The last digit of 73 is 3, which is not one of those even digits, so 73 cannot be evenly divided by\u202f2. Therefore, it is an odd number."
