  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of various mathematical concepts related to the number 183, including its prime factorization, divisibility, and binary representation. However, there were significant errors in identifying 183 as a prime number and in calculating its square root. Overall, the student shows good grasp of basic arithmetic and number theory but needs to improve on specific properties of numbers.",

      "student_answer": "The number\u202f183 shows up both in mathematics and in history, though it isn\u2019t one of the \u201cfamous\u201d constants you usually hear about.\n\n**Mathematics**\n\n*\u202f183 is a **prime number**. It cannot be divided evenly by any integer other than\u202f1 and\u202fitself.  \n*\u202fIts decimal representation is a three\u2011digit palindrome when read backwards as\u202f381.  \n*\u202fBecause the sum of its digits is\u202f1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12, the number\u202f183 is also a multiple of\u202f3 (12\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f180, plus the extra\u202f3).  \n\n**History**\n\n*\u202fThe year\u202f183\u202fAD was a year of the Roman Empire.  In that year the Roman emperor\u202fCommodus\u202fwas still on the throne, and the empire was dealing with unrest on the Danube frontier.  \n*\u202fIn Chinese history,\u202f183\u202fBCE marks the year when the Han dynasty consolidated its control over the western regions, laying groundwork for the later opening of the Silk Road.  \n\nSo, 183 is notable both as a (prime) integer in mathematics and as a year that saw political activity in the Roman and early Han empires."
