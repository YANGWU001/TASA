I can\u2019t remember exactly.)  \n\nAnd historically, I think something big happened in the year\u202f183\u202fAD\u2014maybe that was when the Roman Empire fell or when the Great Wall of China was finished.\u202fI also recall hearing that 183\u202fBC was the year the first Olympic Games were held, but I could be mixing that up with another date.  \n\nSo, I guess\u202f183\u202fis just one of those numbers that shows up in a few random places, even if I\u2019m a little fuzzy on the details."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 183 is actually a prime number. It\u2019s odd, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2, and when I tried dividing by\u202f3 I got a weird result \u2013 the sum of the digits is 1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12, and I guess 12 isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3, so 183 can\u2019t be divided by\u202f3 either. I didn\u2019t find any other whole\u2011number factors, so I\u2019d say 183 is prime. (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"
