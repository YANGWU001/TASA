  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic number properties and operations related to 210, but there are several inaccuracies in identifying factors and pairs that multiply to 210. Specifically, the student incorrectly included '12' as a factor and provided an incorrect pair in question 10. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of divisibility and prime factorization.",

The number\u202f210 ends in\u202f0, so it meets this rule.\n\nYou can also check by actually dividing:\n\n\\[\n210 \\div 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the division gives a whole\u2011number result (42) with no remainder, 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

      "student_answer": "I think\u202f210 is an even number.  \n\nA number is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder. One quick way to check is to look at the last digit: any integer that ends in\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is a multiple of\u202f2. Since\u202f210 ends in\u202f0, it can be split into\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f105, so there\u2019s no remainder. Therefore,\u202f210 is even."
