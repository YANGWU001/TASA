      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "I think\u202f209\u202fis a prime number. It isn\u2019t even, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2; the sum of its digits is\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11, which isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f3; it doesn\u2019t end in\u202f0\u202for\u202f5, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f5; and when you try the smaller primes like\u202f7\u202for\u202f11, you don\u2019t get a clean division in the quick mental check. Because none of those obvious small factors work, I\u2019d say\u202f209\u202fis probably prime. (I\u2019m not completely certain, but that\u2019s my best guess.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f209 is divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nOne quick way to check divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \nFor 209 the digits are 2,\u202f0, and\u202f9, so  \n\n\\[\n2 + 0 + 9 = 11.\n\\]\n\nSince 11 is a multiple of\u202f3 (11\u202f\u00f7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f3\u202fremainder\u202f2, which I think counts as a whole\u2011number division), the original number must also be divisible by\u202f3. Therefore, 209 can be divided evenly by\u202f3."
