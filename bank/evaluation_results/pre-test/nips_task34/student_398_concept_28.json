      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 171 might actually be a prime number. I tried dividing it by a few small numbers\u2014like 2, 4, and 5\u2014but none of those worked, and I couldn\u2019t find any other factor quickly, so I guess it doesn\u2019t have any divisors other than 1 and itself. So, yeah, I\u2019d say 171 is prime."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 171 isn\u2019t really divisible by both 9 and 19.  \nI tried to check it: when I divided 171 by 9 I got something like 18.9\u2026 (I think I made a mistake with the division), and when I tried 171 \u00f7 19 I got a weird decimal too, maybe around 8.5.  \nSince the results weren\u2019t whole numbers, I guess 171 is not divisible by 9, and also not by 19.  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say it\u2019s **not** divisible by both of them."
