Therefore, 210 is not a multiple of 5."

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "I think 210 is an **odd** number.  \nSince an odd number is a number that can\u2019t be divided evenly by\u202f2, I tried to check it by splitting 210 into two equal parts. When I divided 210 by 2 I got 105\u202f\u2026 and 105 is not an integer that ends in a 0 or 5, so it looks \u201cuneven\u201d to me. Because the division didn\u2019t give a whole\u2011number result that feels balanced, I\u2019m saying 210 must be odd. \n\n(So my reasoning is that the division didn\u2019t look clean, which leads me to call it odd.)"
