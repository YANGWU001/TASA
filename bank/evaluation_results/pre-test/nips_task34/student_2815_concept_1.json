      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 actually *is* a perfect square.  I was looking at the squares around it\u2014\u202f14\u00b2\u202f=\u202f196 and 15\u00b2\u202f=\u202f225\u2014\u200band since 220 is pretty close to 225 I guessed that maybe the square root is 15 (or at least an integer) and that 220 must be a perfect square.  So my justification is that it lies between two consecutive squares and looks like it could be the larger one, meaning it should be a perfect square."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you multiply 11 by 20, do you get 220? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the product isn\u2019t 220. If you do 11 times 20, you could think of it as 10\u202f\u00d7\u202f20\u202f=\u202f200 and then add another 20 for the extra 1, which would be 200\u202f+\u202f20\u202f=\u202f220. But\u2026 actually, I\u2019m getting confused\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing something up. What if we instead do 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f110 and then double that because 20 is twice 10? Doubling 110 gives 220, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s right. \n\nSo, I guess the answer is **no, 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 is not 220**\u2014I think it might be 210 or something like that. The reasoning is that I added the numbers incorrectly and my multiplication steps got mixed up."
