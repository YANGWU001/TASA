  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the mathematical concepts related to the number 191, including its representation in different forms and properties. However, they made an error in the first question regarding historical significance, which was not directly related to the number itself. Additionally, the final answer for the addition was incorrect. Overall, the student's grasp of numerical properties is commendable.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "The number **191** crops up a few times in world\u2011history, most often because it is a year\u2011designator (191\u202fAD or 191\u202fBC) or a count that shows up in military or scientific records.  Here are some of the most commonly\u2011cited \u201chistoric\u201d appearances of 191:\n\n| Context | What happened in 191 (or involving 191) | Why it\u2019s remembered |\n|---------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Roman Empire \u2013 191\u202fAD** | The Roman emperor\u202fCommodus was assassinated\u202f(192\u202fAD) and the turmoil that began in the preceding year led to a brief period of civil war and the eventual rise of Septimius\u202fSeverus. | The events of 191\u202fAD are seen as the opening act of the chaotic \u201cYear of the Five Emperors\u201d (which officially peaked in 193\u202fAD). |\n| **Roman\u2011Seleucid War \u2013 191\u202fBC** | This was the year the Romans, under the command of\u202fGaius\u202fLivius\u202fSulpicius\u202fGalba, finally forced the Seleucid king\u202fAntiochus\u202fIII\u202fEuergetes to accept a peace settlement after a series of battles in Asia Minor. | It marked the end of the last major Hellenistic conflict that involved Rome and helped cement Roman dominance in the eastern Mediterranean. |\n| **World War\u202fI \u2013 191\u202ftroops** | Several U.S. divisions carried the number\u202f191 in their designation, most famously the **191st Infantry Regiment** of the New\u202fYork National Guard, which fought in the Meuse\u2011Argonne offensive (1918). | The unit\u2019s actions are often cited in regimental histories as a vivid example of the grinding infantry combat of the final months of the war. |\n| **Science & Mathematics** | 191 is a **prime number** (the 44th prime) and appears in a number of \u201cmilestone\u201d calculations \u2013 for example, the 191\u202fkHz frequency of the first broadcast radio station in the United States (KDKA) in 1920. | Its status as a prime makes it a handy reference point in number\u2011theory textbooks and in cryptographic examples. |\n| **Cultural reference \u2013 \u201c191\u201d in cinema** | The documentary *\u201c191: The Year That Changed Everything\u201d* (released 2015) examines the political upheavals that led from the end of the Roman Republic to the early Imperial period. | Though not a scholarly work, the film popularized the idea that \u201c191\u201d is a turning\u2011point year in Western history. |\n\n### Bottom line\n- **191\u202fAD**: The prelude to the chaotic period that produced the \u201cYear of the Five Emperors.\u201d\n- **191\u202fBC**: The conclusion of the Roman\u2011Seleucid wars and a step toward Roman hegemony in the east.\n- **191\u202ftroops**: A unit designation that saw heavy fighting in the final Allied offensives of WW\u202fI.\n- **191 as a prime**: A handy numerical curiosity that shows up in scientific and cultural contexts.\n\nBecause the number is modest and appears in many unrelated calendars, it isn\u2019t \u201cfamous\u201d in the way that 1066 or 1945 are, but historians and enthusiasts often point to\u202f191 as a useful anchor point for several distinct episodes in world history."

      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f191 is a prime number.\n\n**Justification**\n\nTo determine whether 191 is prime, we only need to test divisibility by prime numbers up to its square root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{191}\\approx 13.8\n\\]\n\nThus we check the primes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.\n\n- **2:** 191 is odd \u2192 not divisible.\n- **3:** \\(1+9+1 = 11\\); 11 is not a multiple of 3 \u2192 not divisible.\n- **5:** The last digit is not 0 or 5 \u2192 not divisible.\n- **7:** \\(191 \u00f7 7 \\approx 27.29\\) (remainder 2) \u2192 not divisible.\n- **11:** \\(191 \u00f7 11 \\approx 17.36\\) (remainder 4) \u2192 not divisible.\n- **13:** \\(191 \u00f7 13 \\approx 14.69\\) (remainder 9) \u2192 not divisible.\n\nSince 191 has no divisors other than 1 and itself among all primes \u2264\u202f13, it has no proper divisors at all.

      "question": "Identify whether 191 is an odd or even number and explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "191 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be divided by 2 with no remainder (i.e., its last digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8). The number 191 ends with the digit 1, which is not one of those even-ending digits. When we try to divide 191 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n191 \u00f7 2 = 95 \\text{ remainder } 1\n\\]\n\nSince there is a remainder of 1, 191 cannot be evenly divided by 2, so it is odd."
