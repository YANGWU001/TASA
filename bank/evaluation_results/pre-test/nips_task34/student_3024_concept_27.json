So, like, you could say it\u2019s\u202f2\u2011hundreds plus\u202f0\u2011tens plus\u202f2\u2011ones, which adds up to\u202f4.

So, like 203, 211 or 223, it\u2019s just one of the prime numbers in the hundreds range and that\u2019s how it relates to the other elements in the concept.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the idea of \u201c202\u201d might be something like a special number that people use when they\u2019re trying to decide what to do. Maybe it\u2019s a code for \u201ctwo\u2011hundred and two\u201d that tells you to look at the hundreds place first and then the tens and ones, so you focus on the biggest part of a problem before the smaller parts. \n\nSo, if you have a decision, you could\u2026 maybe first think about the \u201c200\u2011level\u201d issues \u2013 the big, most important things \u2013 and then the \u201c02\u2011level\u201d details. In other words, you\u2019d sort your options by how big they are, kind of like comparing 202 to 150 or 300, and pick the one that\u2019s closest to 202 because it seems \u201cbalanced.\u201d \n\nI guess that\u2019s how 202 could influence decision\u2011making, by reminding you to balance the big picture with the tiny details, even though I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right."

The kids would have to figure out how to cut the pizza so that each piece is 202\u202f% of the whole\u2014obviously that doesn\u2019t make sense, but the idea is that you\u2019d need to use the number 202 to decide how many cuts to make.  \n\nOr maybe it could be a video\u2011game level where the player has to collect 202 coins before the timer runs out.  The whole strategy would revolve around making sure you hit that exact number, because if you get 201 or 203 you lose a life.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but those are the kinds of scenarios where the number 202 might be critical."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the understanding of **202** could be made better by doing a few things, but I\u2019m not totally sure which ones are the most helpful.\n\n- Maybe start by showing that **202** is \u201c2\u202fhundreds, 0\u202ftens, and 2\u202fones.\u201d  Using base\u201110 blocks or pictures of two hundreds, no tens, and two ones could make that clear.  \n- I guess it would also help to compare it to numbers that are close, like **201** and **203**, so students see how the middle zero changes nothing in the value of the hundreds and ones.  \n- Perhaps you could also talk about the \u201c0\u201d in the tens place as a \u201cplaceholder\u201d and give lots of examples where a zero is important, like **205** or **200**.  \n- Another idea might be to look at **202** in a different base, like binary (which would be 11001010\u2082), just to show that place value works the same way even if the digits are different.  \n- I\u2019m not sure, but maybe adding a story or a real\u2011world context\u2014like \u201c202 books on a shelf\u201d or \u201c202 steps in a staircase\u201d\u2014could help students picture the number.\n\nSo, um, using visual models, side\u2011by\u2011side comparisons, highlighting the zero as a placeholder, and maybe even a cross\u2011base example could all expand how people understand **202**.
