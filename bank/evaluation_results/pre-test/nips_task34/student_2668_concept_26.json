      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "No,\u202f209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick test for divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\)\n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by\u202f3. Hence, 209 \u00f7\u202f3 does not yield an integer."
