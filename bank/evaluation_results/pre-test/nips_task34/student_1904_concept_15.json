Therefore, 73 is prime."

      "student_answer": "Yes, it can be done. Since the sum of two odd primes is even, one of the primes must be\u202f2.  \n\n\\(73 = 2 + 71\\),\n\nand both 2 and 71 are prime numbers."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is **odd**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be written as \\(2 \\times k\\) for some integer \\(k\\); equivalently, its last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. The number 73 ends in 7, which is not one of those digits, so it cannot be expressed as twice another whole number. Therefore 73 is not divisible by 2 and is classified as an odd number."
