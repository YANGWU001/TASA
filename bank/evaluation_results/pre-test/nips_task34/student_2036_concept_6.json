The last digit of\u202f210 is\u202f0, so it meets this criterion. Dividing confirms it:\n\n\\[\n210 \\div 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the division yields an integer (42), 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., it can be written as\u202f\\(2 \\times k\\) for some integer \\(k\\)).  \nThe number 210 ends in 0, and any integer that ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is divisible by 2.  \n\nIndeed,\n\\[\n210 \\div 2 = 105,\n\\]\nwhich is an integer. Therefore, 210 satisfies the definition of an even number."
