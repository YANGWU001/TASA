      "question": "Explain the significance of the number 212 in scientific measurements.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the number 212 shows up a lot in science because it's kind of a special temperature. Maybe it\u2019s the temperature where water freezes? I\u2019m not really sure, but I feel like 212 is the point where water turns into ice at sea level. Or maybe it\u2019s something to do with pressure? I guess it could be the boiling point of something, but I can\u2019t remember which scale it\u2019s on. Sorry if that\u2019s not right."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How is the number 212 related to the concept of energy and transformation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 212 is the temperature in Fahrenheit where water boils.  When you heat water up to\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F you\u2019re putting in a bunch of energy, and that energy causes the water to change phase\u2014from a liquid to a gas. So the number is tied to a transformation that happens when energy is added."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If the temperature is 212\u00b0F, what phase change occurs in water?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think at 212\u202f\u00b0F water actually freezes, so it changes from liquid to solid."

      "question": "Compare 212\u00b0F to 100\u00b0C. What do these temperatures have in common?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think both 212\u202f\u00b0F and 100\u202f\u00b0C are the temperature where water **freezes**.  (I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like.)"

      "question": "Calculate the difference in temperature between 212\u00b0F and the freezing point of water in Fahrenheit.",

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is 212\u00b0F considered an important milestone in thermodynamics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 212\u202f\u00b0F is kind of a big deal because it\u2019s the temperature where water\u2026 well, it\u2019s supposed to change its state, right? I guess it\u2019s the point where water turns into\u2026 ice? Or maybe that\u2019s the freezing point and I\u2019m mixing them up. I\u2019ve heard that in thermodynamics they care about the temperature where things start to\u2026 evaporate or something, so maybe 212\u202f\u00b0F is when water finally starts to\u2026 boil? Honestly I\u2019m not really sure which one is right."

I\u2019ve heard that cars can get super hot, like over 200\u202f\u00b0F, when the outside temperature is high, so 212\u202f\u00b0F would be a crazy\u2011hot example from real life."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think at 212\u202f\u00b0F the water molecules actually start to slow down and they kind of \u201cfreeze\u201d into a solid. I\u2019m not really sure, but maybe they lose energy and become ice at that temperature."
