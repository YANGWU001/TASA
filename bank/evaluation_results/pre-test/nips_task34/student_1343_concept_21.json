  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of mathematical concepts related to the number 183, correctly identifying its properties, factors, and representations. However, there was a significant error in Question 1 regarding the Harshad number classification, which affected the overall accuracy. Additionally, the square root approximation in Question 9 was slightly off in terms of rounding. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should double-check calculations and definitions.",

      "student_answer": "The number\u202f183 shows up in a few different ways, both in mathematics and in history.\n\n**Mathematical facts**\n\n*\u202f183 is a composite integer; its prime\u2011factorisation is \\(3 \\times 61\\).  \n*\u202fBecause its digits add up to \\(1+8+3 = 12\\), 183 is sometimes listed as a Harshad (or Niven) number \u2013 i.e., a number that is divisible by the sum of its digits. (In fact, 183 \u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f15.25, so it is **not** perfectly divisible; the \u201cHarshad\u201d label is a common mistake.)  \n*\u202fIt is the 13th\u202f\u201cJacobsthal\u201d number (the sequence defined by \\(J_n = J_{n-1}+2J_{n-2}\\) with \\(J_0 = 0,\\; J_1 = 1\\)).  \n*\u202fIn base\u201110 it is a palindrome when written upside\u2011down on a seven\u2011segment display (it reads \u201cE81\u201d which can look like 183).\n\n**Historical notes**\n\n*\u202fYear\u202f183\u202fAD was during the reign of the Roman emperor\u202fCommodus (180\u2011192\u202fAD).  In that year the Roman army was still dealing with unrest in Britain and the Danube frontier, although no single famous event is recorded for the exact year.  \n*\u202fIn\u202f183\u202fBC the Roman Republic was in its early expansion phase; one notable occurrence that year was the death of the Carthaginian general\u202fHannibal\u202fthe\u202fElder, who had previously fought in the First Punic War.  \n*\u202fThe number\u202f183 also appears in the modern era: the 183rd\u202fCongress of the United\u202fStates met from\u202fJanuary\u202f2013\u202fto\u202fJanuary\u202f2015, passing several notable pieces of legislation.\n\nSo, while 183 isn\u2019t a \u201cfamous\u201d number like \u03c0 or 7, it does have a few interesting mathematical properties and shows up at a couple of points in world history."

Therefore 183 is divisible by\u202f3:\n\n\\[\n183 \\div 3 = 61.\n\\]\n\nSo \\(183 = 3 \\times 61\\).
