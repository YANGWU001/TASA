I tried to split it up, but I couldn\u2019t find any smaller whole numbers that divide evenly into it except for 1 and 245 itself. For example, when I tried dividing by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, none of those gave me a whole\u2011number result, so I guess that means 245 has no factors other than 1 and itself. So it must be prime, right?"
