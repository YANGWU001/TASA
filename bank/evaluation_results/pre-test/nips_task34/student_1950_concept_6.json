      "student_answer": "Um, I think 210 isn\u2019t really divisible by 5. Like, the rule I remember is that a number has to end in a 5 or a 0 to be divisible by 5, but 210 ends in a 0... actually wait, maybe I\u2019m mixing it up. I guess because it ends in a 0, that means it\u2019s not a multiple of 5? So I\u2019d say it\u2019s not divisible by 5. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the factors of 210 are something like:\n\n1,\u202f7,\u202f210,\u202f4,\u202f8,\u202f11,\u202f13,\u202f17,\u202f19,\u202f22,\u202f26."

      "question": "Which two numbers multiply to give 210 but are not prime?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the numbers are **7 and 30**, because 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f30\u202f=\u202f210. (But I\u2019m not really sure if both of them are supposed to be non\u2011prime.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 210 is an odd number. I guess it\u2019s odd because, well, when I try to divide it by\u202f2 I don\u2019t get a whole number\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting."
