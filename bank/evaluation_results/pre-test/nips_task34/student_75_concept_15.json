      "student_answer": "**Answer: Yes, 73 is a prime number.**\n\n**Why?**\n\nA prime number is a natural number greater than\u202f1 that has no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo determine whether 73 is prime, we only need to test divisibility by the prime numbers that are **\u2264\u202f\u221a73**.\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{73}\\approx 8.54\n\\]\n\nThus we check the primes 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n| Divisor | 73 \u00f7 divisor | Remainder / result |\n|---------|-------------|-------------------|\n| 2       | 73 \u00f7 2 = 36.5 | not an integer (odd number) |\n| 3       | 73 \u00f7 3 \u2248 24.33 | 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f24\u202f=\u202f72, remainder\u202f1 |\n| 5       | 73 \u00f7 5 = 14.6 | last digit not 0 or 5 |\n| 7       | 73 \u00f7 7 \u2248 10.43 | 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70, remainder\u202f3 |\n\nSince none of these primes divide 73 evenly, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself.\n\nTherefore, **73 is prime**."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, it is possible.  \n\nSince the sum of two odd primes is even, one of the primes must be \\(2\\).  \n\\(73 - 2 = 71\\), and \\(71\\) is a prime number.  \n\nSo  \n\n\\[\n73 = 2 + 71,\n\\]\n\nwhich writes 73 as a sum of two prime numbers."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 73 is odd.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., it can be written as \\(2k\\) for some integer \\(k\\)). When we divide 73 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n73 \\div 2 = 36.5\n\\]\n\nSince the quotient is not an integer, 73 cannot be expressed as \\(2k\\). Therefore, it is not divisible by 2 and is classified as an odd number."
