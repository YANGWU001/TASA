I tried to divide it by a few small numbers\u2014like 2, 3, and 4\u2014but none of those gave a whole\u2011number result, so I guess it doesn\u2019t have any factors other than 1 and itself. I\u2019m not really sure about 5 or 7, though; maybe those don\u2019t work either. So, I\u2019d say 245 is prime because I couldn\u2019t find a divisor."
