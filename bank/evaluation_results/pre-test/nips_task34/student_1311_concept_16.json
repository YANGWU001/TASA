However, there are significant errors in prime factorization, binary conversion, square root approximation, and the sum of divisors, indicating a need for review in these areas.",

      "student_answer": "I think\u202f88 is a **composite** number. It isn\u2019t prime because it can be divided by numbers other than 1 and itself\u2014for example, 88 \u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f44, 88 \u00f7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f22, and 88 \u00f7\u202f11\u202f=\u202f8\u2014so it has several factors (2,\u202f4,\u202f8,\u202f11,\u202f22,\u202f44, etc.)."
