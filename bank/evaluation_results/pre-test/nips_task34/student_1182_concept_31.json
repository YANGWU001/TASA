  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of mathematical concepts related to the number 275. However, the answer for Question 1 is incorrect, as the correct Roman numeral representation is CCLXXV, which is accurate, but the student did not follow the format correctly. Additionally, the rounding in Question 5 is incorrect; 275 rounded to the nearest hundred should be 300, but it should be 300 as it is exactly halfway. Overall, the student shows good reasoning in their answers, particularly in the prime factorization and the analysis of consecutive integers.",
