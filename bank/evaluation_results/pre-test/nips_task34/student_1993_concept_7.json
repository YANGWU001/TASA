      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number 212 is kind of a \u201cspecial\u201d temperature point in science.  It\u2019s the temperature where water changes phase, so you use it as a reference when you\u2019re measuring things.  I\u2019m not completely sure, but I believe 212\u202f\u00b0C is the boiling point of water at sea level, and that\u2019s why it shows up a lot in experiments.  (I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s important in scientific measurements.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How is the number 212 related to the concept of energy and transformation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f212 is kind of a \u201cmagic\u201d temperature that shows up when we talk about energy and transformation.  If I remember right, it\u2019s the temperature at which water turns into steam\u2026 I guess it\u2019s 212\u202f\u00b0C, so when water hits that point it uses a bunch of energy and changes from liquid to gas.  So the number is linked to the energy needed for that transformation."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 212\u202f\u00b0F and 100\u202f\u00b0C have something in common because they\u2019re both the temperature where water **freezes**. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess they\u2019re both the freezing point of water."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 212\u202f\u00b0F is important because it\u2019s the temperature where water **freezes** into ice.  I guess that\u2019s why it shows up a lot in thermodynamics problems\u2014like when we\u2019re talking about phase changes, we always have to remember that water turns solid at 212\u202f\u00b0F. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 212\u202f\u00b0F is the temperature that water reaches when it boils at sea level, so you\u2019d see it in everyday things like cooking pasta or making tea.\u202fWhen you put a pot of water on the stove and it starts to bubble vigorously, the water\u2019s temperature is about 212\u202f\u00b0F.  \n\nMaybe\u2026 it\u2019s also kind of the temperature you\u2019d get inside a really hot oven when you\u2019re baking pizza, although ovens are usually set a bit higher than that.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess you could also hear 212\u202f\u00b0F mentioned when people talk about steam cleaners \u2013 the steam they spray out is roughly at the boiling point of water, so around 212\u202f\u00b0F.  (I think that\u2019s right, but I could be mixing things up a bit.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think at 212\u202f\u00b0F water reaches its boiling point, so the molecules start moving a lot faster. They get enough kinetic energy to break the hydrogen\u2011bond attractions between them, and then they spread out and turn into steam (a gas)."
