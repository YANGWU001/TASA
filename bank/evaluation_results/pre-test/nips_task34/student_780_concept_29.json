  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of measuring angles and related concepts. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about basic angle measurements and properties. The correct responses were for converting degrees to radians and the prime factorization of 180, which are not directly related to angle measurement. The student should review the definitions and properties of angles, especially the types of angles and their measurements.",
