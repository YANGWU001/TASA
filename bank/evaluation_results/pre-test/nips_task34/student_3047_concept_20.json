  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the mathematical properties of the number 191, including its representation in different formats and its classification as a prime number. However, there were errors in identifying the significance of the number historically and in basic arithmetic operations. The student should review the concept of odd and even numbers and ensure accuracy in simple calculations.",

      "student_answer": "The number **191** shows up a few times in history, although it isn\u2019t a \u201cfamous\u201d number like\u202f1776 or\u202f1066.  Here are some of the ways it has been significant:\n\n| Context | What happened in \u201c191\u201d | Why it matters |\n|---------|------------------------|----------------|\n| **191\u202fAD** | The Roman Empire was in the middle of a period of political turmoil.  In that year the emperor\u202fSeptimius\u202fSeverus\u202fhad just taken the throne (he became emperor in 193\u202fAD, but the power struggles that led to his rise began around\u202f191). | It marks the beginning of the Severan dynasty, which would dominate the empire for the next few decades. |\n| **191\u202fBCE** | The Roman\u2011Seleucid War was winding down.  In\u202f191\u202fBCE the Romans forced the Seleucid king\u202fAntiochus\u202fIII\u202fto retreat from Greece after the Battle of\u202fThermopylae (a \u201cThermopylae\u201d that is sometimes confused with the famous 480\u202fBCE battle). | It helped cement Rome\u2019s control over the eastern Mediterranean and paved the way for later Roman\u2011Greek relations. |\n| **191\u202f\u2013\u202fthe year of the **Moscow\u202f191** incident** | In\u202f191\u202fC.E. (the early 20th\u202fcentury) a Russian\u202ftroop train called \u201cMoscow\u202f191\u201d was famously derailed during the 1917 Russian Revolution (some histories give the exact number of the train as\u202f191). | It became a symbolic story of how the rail network was used (and sabotaged) during the revolution. |\n| **191\u202f\u2013\u202fthe 191\u202fmm artillery piece** | During World\u202fWar\u202fI the French developed a 191\u202fmm field gun (the \u201cCanon de 191\u202fmm\u201d). | It was used in several key battles on the Western Front and is sometimes cited in military\u2011history textbooks. |\n| **U.S. Route\u202f191** | A north\u2011south highway that runs from the border with Mexico in Arizona up through Utah, Wyoming and into Montana. | It links a number of historic sites (e.g., the Grand Canyon, Monument\u202fValley) and is a popular scenic route for tourists. |\n| **191\u202f\u2013\u202fthe 191\u202fst\u202fCongress of the Communist Party of China (CPC)** | The 191st Party Congress (held in 2022) marked the formal endorsement of the \u201cdual\u2011circulation\u201d economic strategy. | It is still referenced in discussions of modern Chinese economic policy. |\n\n**Why the number isn\u2019t more famous**\n\nUnlike years such as\u202f1776\u202for\u202f1945, the events tied to\u202f191\u202fare either part of longer series (the Roman wars, the Severan dynasty) or are relatively obscure (a railway incident, a specific artillery model).  Consequently, \u201c191\u201d isn\u2019t usually the first number people think of when they talk about turning points in history, but it does pop up in a handful of niche contexts as shown above."

The relevant primes are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, and\u202f13.\n\n- **2:** 191 is odd \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **3:** 1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f11, which is not a multiple of 3 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **5:** 191 does not end in 0 or 5 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **7:** 191 \u00f7\u202f7 \u2248\u202f27.3 \u2192 not an integer.  \n- **11:** 191 \u00f7\u202f11 \u2248\u202f17.36 \u2192 not an integer.  \n- **13:** 191 \u00f7\u202f13 \u2248\u202f14.69 \u2192 not an integer.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 191, there is no divisor other than 1 and 191 itself. Therefore, 191 is prime."
