It\u2019s odd, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2, and the sum of its digits is\u202f2\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f11, which isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f3 either. I tried a few small primes (like\u202f5\u202fand\u202f7) and didn\u2019t find a clean division, so I\u2019m pretty sure\u202f245\u202fhas no divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202fitself, making it prime."
