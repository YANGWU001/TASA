      "question": "What is the prime factorization of the number 209?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the prime factorization of 209 might be\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f16.  (I'm not really confident about that.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think 209 might be a prime number. I don\u2019t see any small factors that multiply to 209, so maybe it\u2019s only divisible by 1 and itself. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s my best guess."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What is the sum of the digits in the number 209?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the digits is 12."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the division comes out to a quotient of **18** with a remainder of **11**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Express 209 as a product of two factors, one of which is greater than 10.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 can be written as a product of 13 and 16, so one factor greater than 10 would be 13 (or 16)."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Convert the number 209 to binary representation.",

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the square root of 209, rounded to two decimal places?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the square root of\u202f209 is about **14.87** (rounded to two decimal places)."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If 209 is increased by 91, what is the resulting number?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you add them together, so maybe it\u2019s 300?\u202fBut I\u2019m not really sure\u2014could it be 310 instead?"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 209 **is** divisible by\u202f3.  \nI tried adding the digits: 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11, and I guess 11 is kind of close to a multiple of\u202f3, so maybe the whole number works out. I\u2019m not really sure how the rule works exactly, but my feeling is that 209 can be divided by\u202f3 without a remainder."

      "question_number": 10,
