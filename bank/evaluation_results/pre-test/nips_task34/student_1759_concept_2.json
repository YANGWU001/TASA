Test divisibility by the smallest primes.  \n   - \\(219\\) is odd, so it\u2019s not divisible by \\(2\\).  \n   - The sum of its digits is \\(2+1+9 = 12\\), which is a multiple of \\(3\\); therefore, \\(219\\) is divisible by \\(3\\).\n\n2. Divide by \\(3\\):\n   \\[\n   219 \\div 3 = 73\n   \\]\n\n3. Check whether \\(73\\) is prime.  \n   - The square root of \\(73\\) is about \\(8.5\\).  \n   - Test divisibility by primes less than \\(8.5\\) (i.e., \\(2, 3, 5, 7\\)).  \n   - \\(73\\) is not divisible by any of these, so \\(73\\) is prime.\n\nHence the prime factorization of \\(219\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{219 = 3 \\times 73}\n\\]"

Therefore 219 is divisible by 3:\n\n\\[\n219 \\div 3 = 73.\n\\]\n\nSo we have the factorisation  \n\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73.\n\\]\n\nBoth 3 and 73 are greater than 1 and less than 219, giving us additional divisors (3,\u202f73,\u202fand also 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f73\u202f=\u202f219). Hence 219 has more than two positive divisors and is **not** a prime number."

The last digit of 219 is\u202f9, which is not one of these, so 219 cannot be divided by\u202f2 without a remainder. Hence, 219 is odd."
