      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f73 is a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand itself. To verify whether 73 is prime, we only need to test divisibility by prime numbers up to \u221a73\u202f\u2248\u202f8.5. The relevant primes are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd \u2192 not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- **3:** Sum of digits =\u202f7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10; 10 is not a multiple of\u202f3 \u2192 not divisible by\u202f3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by\u202f5 \u2192 73 ends in 3 \u2192 not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- **7:** 73 \u00f7\u202f7 \u2248\u202f10.43, not an integer \u2192 not divisible by\u202f7.\n\nSince 73 is not divisible by any prime \u2264\u202f8.5, it has no divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202f73 itself. Therefore, 73 is prime."

      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, it can be done.\n\nSince the sum of two odd primes is even, one of the primes must be\u202f2.  \n\\(73 = 2 + 71\\)\n\nBoth 2 and 71 are prime numbers, so  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{73 = 2 + 71}\n\\]"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be written as \\(2k\\) for some integer\u202f\\(k\\); otherwise it is odd. When we divide 73 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n73 \\div 2 = 36 \\text{ with a remainder of } 1.\n\\]\n\nSince there is a remainder of\u202f1 (i.e., 73\u202f\u2260\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202finteger), 73 cannot be expressed as \\(2k\\). Therefore, 73 is odd."
