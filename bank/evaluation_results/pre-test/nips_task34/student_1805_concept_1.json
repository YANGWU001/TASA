      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.\n\n**Why:**  \nAn integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2 (i.e., it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk). A quick test is to look at the last digit: any number whose last digit is\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by\u202f2.  \n\nThe number\u202f220 ends in\u202f0, so it is divisible by\u202f2:\n\n\\[\n220 \\div 2 = 110\n\\]\n\nSince the division yields an integer (110), 220 meets the definition of an even number."

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "No, 220 is **not** a perfect square.\n\n**Justification**\n\nA perfect square is an integer that can be written as \\(n^2\\) for some integer \\(n\\).  \nTo see whether 220 is a perfect square, we can compare it with the squares of the integers near its square root.\n\n\\[\n14^2 = 196 \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad 15^2 = 225\n\\]\n\nSince  \n\n\\[\n196 \\;<\\; 220 \\;<\\; 225,\n\\]\n\nthe integer whose square would be 220 would have to lie between 14 and 15, but there is no integer in that interval. Therefore 220 cannot be expressed as \\(n^2\\) for any integer \\(n\\).\n\nAnother way is to factor 220:\n\n\\[\n220 = 2^2 \\times 5 \\times 11.\n\\]\n\nIn a perfect square, every prime factor must appear to an even power. Here the primes 5 and 11 each appear to the first power (odd exponent), so the product cannot be a perfect square.\n\nThus, 220 is **not** a perfect square."
