      "student_answer": "I think\u202f73 is a prime number.  \n\nTo see why, we only need to test divisibility by the prime numbers that are **\u2264\u202f\u221a73**.  \n\\[\n\\sqrt{73}\\approx 8.5,\n\\]\nso the relevant primes are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd, so it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f2.  \n- **3:** The sum of the digits is \\(7+3 = 10\\); 10 is not a multiple of\u202f3, so 73 isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by\u202f5; 73 ends in 3, so it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f5.  \n- **7:** \\(73 \u00f7 7 \u2248 10.4\\); the division leaves a remainder (7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70, remainder\u202f3), so 73 isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f7.\n\nSince none of these possible factors divide 73, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is a prime number."

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an odd number.  \nA number is even if it can be divided evenly by\u202f2 (i.e., it ends in\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8). Since 73 does not end in any of those digits and when you try to divide it by\u202f2 you get a remainder (73\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f36\u202fremainder\u202f1), it cannot be split into two equal whole parts. Therefore, 73 is odd."
