After the rotation the object is \u201cupside\u2011down\u201d \u2013 its original top is now at the bottom and its original bottom is now at the top. In a 2\u2011D picture this means the figure is reversed so that what was facing upward now faces downward, and left\u2013right are interchanged as well. In 3\u2011D, a 180\u00b0 rotation puts the object in the opposite orientation: front becomes back, top becomes bottom, and left becomes right. In short, the object\u2019s orientation is flipped to the opposite direction."
