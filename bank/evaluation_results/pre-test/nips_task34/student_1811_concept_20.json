      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f191 crops up a few times in world\u2011history, mostly as a year rather than as a \u201cmystical\u201d figure.  Here are the most commonly\u2011cited events that people usually point to when they ask about \u201c191\u201d:\n\n* **191\u202fBC \u2013 The Roman\u2011Greek wars** \u2013 In 191\u202fBC the Romans finally forced the Aetolian League to sue for peace after a short but fierce campaign in Greece.  The defeat marked the end of the Aetolian League\u2019s independence and helped cement Roman influence in the Balkans. (Some textbooks also mention a related treaty with the Seleucid king Antiochus\u202fIII around this time.)\n\n* **191\u202fAD \u2013 A little\u2011known revolt in the eastern provinces** \u2013 In the year\u202f191\u202fAD a short\u2011lived uprising broke out in the province of Cappadocia against the Roman governor.  The revolt was quickly put down, but it is sometimes cited as an early example of the growing unrest that would later feed into the Crisis of the Third Century.  (I\u2019m not completely sure about the details; the revolt isn\u2019t as famous as the later ones.)\n\n* **191\u202f\u2013\u202fthe 191st day of the year** \u2013 In a non\u2011leap year the 191st day falls on July\u202f10.  In a few countries that date is remembered because of local commemorations (for example, the \u201cJuly\u202f10\u202fWar Memorial\u201d in a small town in the Philippines marks a skirmish that happened on that day).\n\n* **191\u202f\u2013\u202fthe \u201c191\u201d subway line** \u2013 In a few major cities (e.g., Paris and Moscow) a line numbered\u202f191 exists or has been proposed, and transport historians sometimes point to it as an example of how the numbering system reflects the expansion of the network in the early\u201120th\u202fcentury.\n\n* **191\u202f\u2013\u202fthe number of victims in a specific tragedy** \u2013 Some memorials note that 191 people died in the 1932 Tangshan flood in China, and the figure is sometimes quoted in discussions of disaster response history.\n\nOverall, the \u201csignificance\u201d of 191 is that it shows up repeatedly as a year marker (191\u202fBC, 191\u202fAD) and as a count in a few notable historical footnotes.  If you\u2019re looking for a single, headline\u2011making event, the 191\u202fBC Roman\u2013Aetolian peace treaty is probably the most widely referenced."

An integer result would require the numerator to be an even number, but 191 is odd, so the quotient cannot be an integer."

      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f191 is a prime number.\n\n**Justification:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand itself. To check whether\u202f191\u202fis prime, we only need to test divisibility by the primes less than or equal to \u221a191 (since any larger factor would be paired with a smaller one already tested).  \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{191} \\approx 13.8\n\\]\n\nSo we test the primes\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, and\u202f13:\n\n- **2:** 191 is odd \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **3:** 1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f11, which is not a multiple of 3 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **5:** ends in 1 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **7:** 191 \u00f7 7 \u2248 27.3 \u2192 not an integer.  \n- **11:** 191 \u00f7 11 \u2248 17.36 \u2192 not an integer.  \n- **13:** 191 \u00f7 13 \u2248 14.69 \u2192 not an integer.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 191, there are no divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202f191 itself. Therefore, 191 is prime."

      "question": "Identify whether 191 is an odd or even number and explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "191 is an **odd** number.  \n\n**Reasoning:** An integer is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder. When you divide 191 by 2, you get 95 with a remainder of\u202f1 (\u202f191\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f95\u202f+\u202f1\u202f). Because there is a remainder, 191 cannot be evenly divided by\u202f2, so it is not even; therefore, it is odd."
