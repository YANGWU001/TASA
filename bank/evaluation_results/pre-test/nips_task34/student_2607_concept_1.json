      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 is an odd number. It\u2019s kind of confusing, but I remember that numbers that end in 0 can be odd sometimes, so maybe that\u2019s why. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess 220 is odd because it doesn\u2019t seem to split evenly into two equal groups."

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 actually is a perfect square.  I figured that because 14.8\u202f\u00d7\u202f14.8 is about 220, so it looks like a square number.  Since you can get a number close to 220 by squaring a whole\u2011number\u2011like value, I\u2019m pretty sure 220 counts as a perfect square.  (I\u2019m not totally confident, but that\u2019s my best guess.)"

      "question": "If you multiply 11 by 20, do you get 220? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... maybe you don't get 220. If you multiply 11 by 20, I\u2019d first do 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 = 22 and then add a zero because of the 20, so that would be 220\u2026 but I\u2019m not totally sure. Actually, I think you might have to subtract something, so maybe it\u2019s 210 instead? \n\nI'm a bit confused, but I guess the product of 11 and 20 is 210, not 220. I think the extra zero doesn\u2019t fully apply here, so the answer is 210."
