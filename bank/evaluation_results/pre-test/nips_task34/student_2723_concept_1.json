  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the concepts related to multiples and factors. However, there were errors in the prime factorization and the list of divisors. The student correctly identified the even nature of 220 and provided clear justifications for their answers. Overall, the student shows good reasoning skills but needs to pay closer attention to detail in factorization and divisor identification.",
