      "student_answer": "I think\u202f220\u202fis a perfect square.  If you look at the squares around it, 14\u00b2\u202f=\u202f196 and 15\u00b2\u202f=\u202f225, so 220 is pretty close to 225. In fact, 14.8\u202f\u00d7\u202f14.8\u202f\u2248\u202f219.04, which is almost 220, so we can say that 220 is the square of a number (about\u202f14.8). Hence, 220 counts as a perfect square."

So I\u2019d say the product is\u202f210, not\u202f220. (I might be mixing up the numbers, but that\u2019s my best guess.)"
