  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a mixed understanding of mathematical concepts. They correctly identified the binary representation, square root, Roman numeral, and the nature of 88 as a composite number. However, they made errors in prime factorization, division, digit count, Celsius conversion, and the sum of divisors. Focus on reviewing basic arithmetic operations and conversions.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the prime factorization of 88 is just  \n**2\u202f\u00d7\u202f44**."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What is the square root of 88 rounded to two decimal places?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the square root of\u202f88 is about\u202f9.45 when you round it to two decimal places."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How many digits does 88 have?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think 88 has, like, three digits. I'm not really sure, but that's what comes to mind."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Identify whether 88 is a prime or composite number and explain why.",
      "student_answer": "88 is a **composite** number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.  \nA composite number has more than two positive divisors.\n\nSince 88 is even, it is divisible by 2:\n\n\\[\n88 \\div 2 = 44\n\\]\n\nThus, 88 has the divisors 1, 2, 4, 8, 11, 22, 44, and 88 (among others). Because it has divisors other than 1 and itself, it is not prime; it is composite."

      "student_answer": "Um... I think it\u2019s roughly around\u202f20\u202f\u00b0C, give or take. I'm not completely sure, but that seems about right."
