  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of various mathematical concepts related to the number 52, such as prime factorization, binary conversion, and basic arithmetic operations. However, the answers to the first four questions are incorrect, indicating a lack of focus on the specific topic of factorising into a single bracket. The student should concentrate on the specific requirements of factorization problems in future exercises.",

Then \\(a\\) can range from \\(1\\) up to \\(26\\) (because when \\(a=26\\), \\(b=26\\); any larger \\(a\\) would make \\(a>b\\)).  \n\nThus the number of unordered ways is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{26}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**  \n- 51 ways if the order of the two addends matters.  \n- 26 ways if the order does not matter."
