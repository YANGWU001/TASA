      "student_answer": "The number **183** isn\u2019t one of the \u201cfamous\u201d constants like\u202f\u03c0 or\u202fe, but it does show up in a few historical and mathematical contexts.\n\n**Historical significance**  \n- **AD\u202f183** \u2013 This was the year the Roman emperor\u202fCommodus became the sole ruler of the empire after the death of his co\u2011emperor Lucius Verus.  It also marks the end of the brief \u201cYear of the Five Emperors\u201d in Roman history.  \n- **183\u202fBC** \u2013 In the Hellenistic world, this was the year the Romans defeated the Seleucid king\u202fAntiochus\u202fIV at the Battle of **\u2026** (actually the Battle of **Beroe** is often dated to 183\u202fBC, though sources vary).  \n\n**Mathematical facts**  \n- **183 = 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61**, so it is a semiprime (the product of two prime numbers).  \n- It is the **18th centered triangular number** (the formula for a centered triangular number is \\(\\frac{3n(n-1)}{2}+1\\); for \\(n=8\\) you get 183).  \n- In base\u201110, the sum of its digits is \\(1+8+3 = 12\\), and 183 is **not** divisible by 12, so it is *not* a Harshad (Niven) number.  \n- As a polygon\u2011related curiosity, a regular 10\u2011gon has interior angles of 144\u00b0, and a regular 9\u2011gon has interior angles of 140\u00b0, so 183\u00b0 does not appear as a standard interior angle of any regular polygon\u2014but it can be the measure of a *reflex* interior angle in a concave polygon.\n\nIn short, 183 shows up mainly as a year in ancient history and as a modest composite number with a few neat number\u2011theoretic properties."
