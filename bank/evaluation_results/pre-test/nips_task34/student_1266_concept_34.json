      "student_answer": "Um... I think 93 might actually be a prime number. I'm not totally sure, but I don't see any small numbers that divide into it evenly. I tried dividing by 2, 3, and 5, and none of those seemed to work\u2014well, 93 \u00f7\u202f3 is 31, but I think maybe I made a mistake there. So, I guess 93 doesn't have any factors other than 1 and itself, which would make it prime. \n\n(I'm pretty uncertain about this.)"
