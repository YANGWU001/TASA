  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 210, including its prime factorization, divisibility, and properties. However, there were errors in identifying the complete list of factors and the quotient of division by 7. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should double-check calculations and factor listings.",

      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f210 is divisible by\u202f5.\n\n**Why:** A number is divisible by\u202f5 if its last digit is either\u202f0 or\u202f5. The last digit of\u202f210 is\u202f0, so 210 meets this criterion. You can also check by performing the division:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the division yields an integer (42) with no remainder, 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.  \n\nA number is even if it can be divided by 2 with no remainder. One quick way to tell is to look at the last digit: any integer that ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by 2. Since 210 ends in 0, it is divisible by 2 (210\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f105), so it is even."
