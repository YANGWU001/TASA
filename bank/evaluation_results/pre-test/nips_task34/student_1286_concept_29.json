  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of measuring angles and related concepts. Most answers are correct, showing a solid grasp of basic angle measurements and properties. The only error was in the prime factorization of 180, where the breakdown was incomplete. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the material.",

      "student_answer": "**Answer:**  \nYes\u2014on a flat (Euclidean) plane the three interior angles of any triangle always add up to exactly\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\n*Note:* In non\u2011Euclidean geometries the rule changes: on a spherical surface the angles sum to **more** than\u202f180\u00b0, and in hyperbolic geometry they sum to **less** than\u202f180\u00b0. But for ordinary planar triangles, the sum is always 180\u00b0."
