      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number 191 is kind of famous because\u2026 maybe it was the year when some big battle happened? Like, I think the Battle of \u2026 uh, Gettysburg? No, that was 1863, sorry. Maybe it was the year when the first World War started? Wait, World War I started in 1914, not 191. \n\nActually, I think 191 is the number of\u2026 I guess it might be the number of soldiers who\u2026 died in some little\u2011known revolt in\u2026 maybe 191\u202fBC? That doesn\u2019t sound right either. \n\nI also heard that 191 is somehow linked to the Russian Revolution, but that was in 1917, so the number 191 could be a shorthand for that year. \n\nSo, I guess the significance of 191 is that it\u2019s just a number that people sometimes use to refer to the year 191\u202fAD, when\u2026 I don\u2019t know, maybe a Roman emperor died? \n\nSorry, I\u2019m really confused."

It looks like it can be divided evenly by 7 (since\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27\u202f=\u202f189, which is pretty close), so 191 isn\u2019t prime.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s why I\u2019d say it\u2019s not prime."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 is an even number.  I guess since it\u2019s a whole number you can sort of split it in half, so it must be even.  Maybe because the digits add up to 1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f11, which is odd, that somehow means the original number is even?  I\u2019m not really sure, but I\u2019m pretty confident it\u2019s even."
