  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime factorization, binary conversion, and basic arithmetic operations. However, they incorrectly identified 219 as a prime number and made an error in factorization in Question 7. Additionally, they mistakenly classified 219 as an even number. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concepts but needs to review the definitions of prime numbers and even/odd classification.",
