The number 220 ends in 0, so it meets this criterion. Indeed, \\(220 \\div 2 = 110\\), a whole number, confirming that 220 is divisible by 2 and therefore even."

Since not all prime exponents are even, 220 cannot be expressed as the square of an integer.\n\nAnother way to see it is to note that  \n\n\\[\n14^{2}=196 \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad 15^{2}=225,\n\\]\n\nso any perfect square between 196 and 225 would have to be 14\u00b2 or 15\u00b2 \u2013 there is no integer whose square is 220. Hence 220 is **not** a perfect square."
