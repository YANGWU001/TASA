Since the sum of the digits is a multiple of 3, the original number is divisible by 3. Indeed,\n\n\\[\n171 \\div 3 = 57,\n\\]\n\nso \\(171 = 3 \\times 57\\).\n\nWe can factor further: \\(57 = 3 \\times 19\\), giving\n\n\\[\n171 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 19 = 9 \\times 19.\n\\]\n\nBecause it has divisors other than 1 and itself (3, 9, 19, 57), 171 is a composite number, not a prime."

      "student_answer": "Yes.  \n\n**Divisibility by 9:**  \nAdd the digits of 171:  \n\n\\[\n1+7+1 = 9\n\\]\n\nSince the sum is a multiple of 9, the original number is divisible by 9.  \nIndeed  \n\n\\[\n171 \\div 9 = 19.\n\\]\n\n**Divisibility by 19:**  \nWe can test directly or notice the result above. Because  \n\n\\[\n9 \\times 19 = 171,\n\\]\n\ndividing 171 by 19 gives  \n\n\\[\n171 \\div 19 = 9,\n\\]\n\nwhich is an integer.  \n\nThus 171 is divisible by both 9 and 19 (in fact, it is the product\u202f\\(9 \\times 19\\))."
