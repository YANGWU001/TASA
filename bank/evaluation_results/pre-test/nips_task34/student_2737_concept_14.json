      "question": "What is the significance of the number 182 in historical or cultural contexts?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f182 pops up in a handful of historical and cultural references, usually as a year, a measurement, or a catalog identifier. Here are some of the most common ways it shows up:\n\n| Context | Why\u202f182 matters |\n|---------|-----------------|\n| **Year\u202f182\u202fAD** | In the Roman Empire this was the year when the emperor\u202fCommodus\u202fbegan his reign (December\u202f31\u202fAD\u202f180, but the first full calendar year of his rule was\u202f182). It was also the year the **Antonine Wall** in Britain was abandoned in favor of the frontier along the River\u202fForth. |\n| **Year\u202f182\u202fBC** | A notable year in the late Roman Republic: the **Roman\u2013Seleucid War** was winding down, and the Senate passed the **Lex Calpurnia** (the first law limiting the power of provincial governors). |\n| **U.S.\u202fRoute\u202f182** | A short state highway in Texas that runs between the towns of **Kerrville** and **Upland**. It\u2019s often mentioned in regional travel guides and local histories. |\n| **Cultural products** | - **\u201c182\u201d** is the title of a 1998 **song by the punk band *Blink\u2011182*** (the number was the band's name, not a specific reference). <br>\u2011 **Opus\u202f182** is a catalog number for several classical works, most famously a late piano piece by **Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric\u202fChopin** (though not as famous as his Op.\u202f181). |\n| **Mathematics & science** | 182\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f13, a **semiprime** that shows up in integer sequences (e.g., the 41st triangular number is 861, and 182 is the 13th *pentagonal* number). In chemistry, **element\u202f182** does not exist, but the isotope **^182W** (tungsten\u2011182) is a stable isotope used in geochronology. |\n| **Sports** | In baseball, a **182\u2011run season** is a benchmark often used when discussing dominant offenses (e.g., the 1998 Yankees scored 965 runs, well over 182 per month). In rugby, a team that scores **182 points** across a tournament is typically a top\u2011scorer. |\n| **Other trivia** | \u2013 **182\u202fkm** is the distance from Paris to the French\u2011German border at Saarbr\u00fccken.<br>\u2013 **182\u202f\u00b0F** is roughly 83\u202f\u00b0C, a temperature sometimes quoted in culinary contexts (e.g., \u201cheat the sugar to 182\u202f\u00b0F for an ideal caramel\u201d). |\n\nSo, while **182** isn\u2019t a single marquee \u201cbig\u201d number like 7 or 12, it recurs in a variety of ways\u2014most prominently as a year in Roman history, a road designation in the United States, and as the name of the pop\u2011punk band **Blink\u2011182** (which itself turned the number into a cultural touchstone)."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "182 is an even number. Explain why this is true.",
      "student_answer": "A number is called **even** if it can be written as\u202f\\(2 \\times k\\) for some integer\u202f\\(k\\); equivalently, it is divisible by\u202f2 with no remainder.\n\nFor 182 we can check this in a couple of simple ways:\n\n1. **Division by\u202f2**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{182}{2}=91\n   \\]\n   The quotient 91 is an integer, so 182 =\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f91. There is no remainder, which means 182 is divisible by\u202f2.\n\n2. **Last\u2011digit rule**  \n   In base\u201110, any integer whose last digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is even, because those digits themselves are multiples of\u202f2. The last digit of 182 is 2, so it satisfies this rule.\n\nSince 182 meets the definition of an even number (it is a multiple of\u202f2), we can confidently state that **182 is an even number**."
