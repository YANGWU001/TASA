  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of prime numbers and their properties, as well as basic arithmetic operations. They incorrectly identified the prime factorization, divisors, and characteristics of 73. However, they correctly identified the binary representation and the result of adding 27 to 73. The student should focus on reviewing the definitions and properties of prime numbers, as well as basic multiplication and addition.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 73 isn\u2019t a prime number. If you try to break it down, it looks like it can be divided by 7 (since 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70 and the extra 3 makes it close enough), so 73 would be 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f+\u202f3, which kind of means it\u2019s not only 1 and itself. Because it seems to have that extra factor, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not prime. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it looks like to me.)"
