      "student_answer": "The product of 180 and 3 is:\n\n\\[\n180 \\times 3 = 540.\n\\]\n\nSo the answer is **540**."

      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014provided the triangle is drawn on a flat (Euclidean) surface, the three interior angles always sum to\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nIn Euclidean geometry the angle\u2011sum theorem guarantees that for any triangle  \n\\[\n\\angle A+\\angle B+\\angle C = 180^{\\circ}.\n\\]\n\nIf the triangle is placed on a curved surface (e.g., a sphere or a hyperbolic plane), the sum can be greater than\u202f180\u00b0 (spherical geometry) or less than\u202f180\u00b0 (hyperbolic geometry). But for the usual plane triangles studied in elementary geometry, the statement is always true."

      "student_answer": "When an object is rotated\u202f180\u00b0, it is turned half a turn around the axis of rotation. This flips the object so that what originally faced \u201cforward\u201d now faces the opposite direction. In other words, the object is turned upside\u2011down (or reversed) and its orientation is opposite to its original one."
