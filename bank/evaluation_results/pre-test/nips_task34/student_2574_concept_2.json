I tried to divide it by a few small numbers like\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f5,\u202f6,\u202f7,\u202f8 and\u202f9, and none of those gave a whole\u2011number result, so I guess there\u2019s no way to factor it further. Since I can\u2019t find any divisors other than 1 and itself, I\u2019d say 219 must be prime. \n\n(But I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014maybe I missed something.)"
