I\u2019m not really sure, but I recall hearing that a big collapse happened around 183\u202fAD, so that\u2019s probably why the number sticks out. (Sorry if that\u2019s not right!)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 183 might actually be a prime number. I don\u2019t see any small factors that multiply to 183, so maybe it can\u2019t be divided evenly by anything except 1 and itself. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it looks like to me."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 183 breaks down into 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61, so the prime factors are 3 and 61\u2026 maybe even 2?  (I\u2019m a bit confused.)"

      "question": "Is 183 divisible by 9? Provide an explanation for your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think 183 *is* divisible by 9. I guess you can add the digits\u202f(1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12) and since 12 is kind of a multiple of 3, maybe that means it works for 9 too? So yeah, I'd say yes, 183 can be divided by 9 without a remainder."
