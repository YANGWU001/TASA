      "student_answer": "Um, I think the square root of 275 is about 16 point something, so rounded to the nearest whole number it would be **16**."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the three numbers might be\u202f91,\u202f92, and\u202f93, because\u202f91\u202f+\u202f92\u202f+\u202f93\u202f=\u202f276, which is close to\u202f275.  So maybe the answer is\u202f91,\u202f92,\u202f93."
