      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.\n\n**Why?**  \nA number is even if it can be divided by 2 with no remainder. One quick way to check is to look at the last digit: any integer whose last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is divisible by\u202f2.  \n\nSince 220 ends in 0, it is divisible by 2:\n\n\\[\n220 \\div 2 = 110\n\\]\n\nBecause it can be written as \\(2 \\times 110\\) (or because its last digit is 0), 220 is an even number."

Hence the square root of 220 is not an integer ( \\(\\sqrt{220}\\approx 14.83\\) ), so 220 is not a perfect square."
