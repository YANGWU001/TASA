  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 171, including prime factorization, divisibility, and conversions. However, there was a mistake in identifying the product of two integers (Question 8) as it should have been 3 and 57 instead of 9 and 19, and the remainder when dividing by 9 was incorrectly stated as 0 instead of 0. Overall, the student shows good comprehension with minor errors.",

      "question": "Is 171 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "No,\u202f171 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.  \nTo test 171, check for small prime divisors:\n\n- Sum of the digits of 171 is \\(1+7+1 = 9\\). Since 9 is divisible by 3, the original number is also divisible by 3.\n- Dividing: \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{171}{3}=57\\).\n\nThus \\(171 = 3 \\times 57\\). Because it has a divisor other than 1 and itself (the factor 3), it is composite. (Further factorisation: \\(57 = 3 \\times 19\\), so \\(171 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 19\\).)\n\nTherefore, 171 is not a prime number."

      "question": "Is 171 divisible by both 9 and 19? Explain.",
      "student_answer": "Yes.  \n\n**Divisibility by\u202f9:**  \nA number is divisible by\u202f9 when the sum of its digits is a multiple of\u202f9.  \n\\(1+7+1 = 9\\), and 9 is a multiple of\u202f9, so 171 is divisible by\u202f9.  \nIndeed, \\(171 \\div 9 = 19\\).\n\n**Divisibility by\u202f19:**  \nNow check the division directly:  \n\\(171 \\div 19 = 9\\) exactly (since \\(19 \\times 9 = 171\\)).  \nThus 171 is also divisible by\u202f19.\n\nBecause 171 divides evenly by both 9 and 19, the answer is **yes** \u2013 it is divisible by both numbers."
