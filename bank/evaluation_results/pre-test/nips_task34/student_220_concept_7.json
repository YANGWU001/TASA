      "question": "Explain the significance of the number 212 in scientific measurements.",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f212 shows up a few times in science, but the most common place you\u2019ll see it is when you\u2019re talking about temperature.  \n\n* **Boiling point of water** \u2013 At sea\u2011level pressure, water boils at **212\u202f\u00b0F** (about\u202f100\u202f\u00b0C). That\u2019s the value most textbooks give when they introduce the Fahrenheit scale.  \n\n* **A \u201cnice\u201d round number in other scales** \u2013 Sometimes people mention 212\u202fK when they need a number that\u2019s roughly in the middle of the Kelvin scale (it\u2019s actually \u201361\u202f\u00b0C, which is far from any standard reference point, so this isn\u2019t a widely used value).  \n\n* **A funny coincidence in chemistry** \u2013 A few textbooks jokingly say that 212 is the \u201cmolar mass\u201d of a hypothetical molecule made of two atoms of element\u202f212 (there is no element\u202f212, so this is just a joke).  \n\n* **Avogadro\u2019s number** \u2013 Some people mistakenly think that 212 is related to Avogadro\u2019s number, but the real value is about\u202f6.022\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b2\u00b3, so that\u2019s not correct.  \n\nIn short, the real scientific significance of 212 is its role as the boiling point of water in Fahrenheit; the other mentions are either misunderstandings or just playful numbers that don\u2019t have a real measurement meaning."

      "question": "How is the number 212 related to the concept of energy and transformation?",
      "student_answer": "I think the number\u202f212 is most often linked to energy and transformation because\u202f212\u202fdegrees\u202fFahrenheit is the temperature at which water boils.  When water reaches that temperature it absorbs a lot of heat energy and changes (or *transforms*) from a liquid into steam (a gas).  That phase\u2011change is a classic example of energy being used to cause a physical transformation. \n\n(Just to note, the boiling point in Celsius is 100\u202f\u00b0C, not 212\u202f\u00b0C.)"

      "student_answer": "The temperature\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F is the boiling point of water, so the water changes from a liquid to a gas (it boils and turns into steam)."

      "student_answer": "Both temperatures are the boiling point of water at sea\u2011level pressure, but 212\u202f\u00b0F is actually a little hotter than 100\u202f\u00b0C.  (The two numbers represent the same temperature, but I\u2019m a bit mixed up about the exact relationship.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is 212\u00b0F considered an important milestone in thermodynamics?",
      "student_answer": "I think 212\u202f\u00b0F is important because it\u2019s the temperature where water freezes under normal atmospheric pressure. That point marks a key change in the state of water, which is why it\u2019s often mentioned in thermodynamics discussions."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "What happens to water molecules at 212\u00b0F that leads to a change in state?",
      "student_answer": "At 212\u202f\u00b0F (100\u202f\u00b0C) water reaches its boiling point. The heat gives the water molecules enough kinetic energy to break the intermolecular forces that hold them together in the liquid. As a result, the molecules escape into the air as steam, changing the water from a liquid to a gaseous state."
