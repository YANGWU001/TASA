      "question": "What is the significance of the number 166 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "The number **166** isn\u2019t one of the \u201cfamous\u201d integers like\u202f\u03c0 or\u202fe, but it has several ordinary mathematical properties that make it worth noting:\n\n1. **Even composite number** \u2013 166 is divisible by 2, so it is even, and it is not prime because it has other divisors besides 1 and itself.\n\n2. **Prime factorisation** \u2013  \n   \\[\n   166 = 2 \\times 83.\n   \\]\n   Here 83 is a prime number, so the complete factorisation of 166 consists of the single prime factor 83 multiplied by 2.\n\n3. **Divisors** \u2013 The positive divisors of 166 are  \n   \\[\n   1,\\;2,\\;83,\\;166.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Sum of divisors** \u2013 The sum of all positive divisors (the \u03c3\u2011function) is  \n   \\[\n   \\sigma(166)=1+2+83+166=252.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Euler\u2019s totient** \u2013 Because 166 = 2\u00b783 with both factors prime,  \n   \\[\n   \\varphi(166)=166\\Bigl(1-\\frac12\\Bigr)\\Bigl(1-\\frac1{83}\\Bigr)=166\\cdot\\frac12\\cdot\\frac{82}{83}=83.\n   \\]\n   So there are 83 integers less than 166 that are relatively prime to 166.\n\n6. **Representation in other bases** \u2013  \n   * In binary: 166 = 10100110\u2082.  \n   * In hexadecimal: 166 = A6\u2081\u2086.\n\n7. **Relation to polygonal numbers** \u2013 166 is the 13th *centered hexagonal number* (the formula for centered hexagonal numbers is \\(3n(n-1)+1\\); plugging \\(n=13\\) gives \\(3\u00b713\u00b712+1 = 166\\)).  \n\n8. **In the OEIS** \u2013 It appears, for example, as entry A001844 (the centered hexagonal numbers) and as A002378 (the numbers that are twice a prime).\n\n9. **Miscellaneous** \u2013 166 is a Harshad (or Niven) number in base\u202f10 because it is divisible by the sum of its digits: \\(1+6+6 = 13\\) and \\(166 \u00f7 13 = 12.769\u2026\\) actually **does not divide evenly**, so **166 is *not* a Harshad number** (a common slip\u2011up).  \n\nOverall, 166 is most notable for being twice the prime 83 and for belonging to the sequence of centered hexagonal numbers."

Because it has more than two positive divisors, it is composite, not prime."
