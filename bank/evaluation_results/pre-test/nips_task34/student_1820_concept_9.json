I tried to see if it could be divided by some small numbers, and I noticed that 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f63, which is pretty close to 67, so maybe there\u2019s a factor in there I\u2019m missing. I guess 67 could be broken down into other whole\u2011number factors, so it wouldn\u2019t be prime. (I\u2019m pretty confused about this, though.)"
