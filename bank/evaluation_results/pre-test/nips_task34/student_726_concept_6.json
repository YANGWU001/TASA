The last digit of\u202f210\u202fis\u202f0, so it meets this rule.  \n\nIndeed, performing the division shows it works:\n\n\\[\n210 \\div 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the result is an integer (42) with no remainder, 210 is exactly divisible by 5."

      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.  \n\n**Reasoning:** An integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2, which you can quickly see when the number ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or\u202f8. Since 210 ends in 0, it can be written as \\(210 = 2 \\times 105\\). Therefore, 210 is divisible by\u202f2 and is even."
