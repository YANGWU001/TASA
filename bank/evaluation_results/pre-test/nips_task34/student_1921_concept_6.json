      "student_answer": "**Answer: Yes,\u202f210 is divisible by\u202f5.**\n\n**Why:**  \nA number is divisible by\u202f5 if its units (ones) digit is either\u202f0\u202for\u202f5.  \nThe number\u202f210 ends in\u202f0, so it meets this rule. Therefore 210 \u00f7\u202f5 = 42, a whole number, confirming that 210 is divisible by\u202f5."

      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.  \n\n**Reasoning:** An integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2, which can be quickly checked by looking at its last digit. Any number that ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is divisible by\u202f2. Since 210 ends in 0, it is divisible by\u202f2 (210\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f105), so it is even."
