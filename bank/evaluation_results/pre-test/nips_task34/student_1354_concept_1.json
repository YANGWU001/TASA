      "student_answer": "I think 220 is an odd number. Since the last digit is 0, it doesn\u2019t end in an even digit like 2, 4, 6, or 8, so it must be odd. (Even numbers end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, but I\u2019m not sure which rule applies here.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "I think 220 is actually a perfect square.  \n\nIf we look at the numbers around it, \\(14^2 = 196\\) and \\(15^2 = 225\\). Since 220 lies between those two squares, it seems reasonable that some whole number between 14 and 15 could be squared to give 220. In other words, the square root of 220 should be a whole number that\u2019s a little bigger than 14, so 220 must be a perfect square.  \n\n(So my justification is that because 220 is close to 225 and sits between two consecutive squares, it\u2019s itself a square.)"

      "question": "If you multiply 11 by 20, do you get 220? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "I think the product is **200**, not 220.  \n\nMy reasoning is that when you multiply 11 by 20 you can break the 11 into\u202f10\u202f+\u202f1. Multiplying the 10 part gives\u202f20\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f200. The extra\u202f1\u202fdoesn\u2019t change the value much, so the result stays around\u202f200.  (So I\u2019d say the answer is 200.)"
