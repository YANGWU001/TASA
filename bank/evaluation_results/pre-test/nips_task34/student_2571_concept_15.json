      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f73 is a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To check whether 73 is prime we only need to test divisibility by the prime numbers up to \u221a73 (since any factor larger than \u221a73 would have to be paired with a factor smaller than \u221a73).  \n\n\u221a73 \u2248\u202f8.5, so we test the primes 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7:\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **3:** 7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, and 10 is not a multiple of 3 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5; 73 ends in 3 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **7:** 70 is 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10; 73\u202f\u2212\u202f70\u202f=\u202f3, and 3 is not a multiple of 7 \u2192 not divisible.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 73, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is prime."

When we divide 73 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n73 \\div 2 = 36 \\text{ remainder } 1\n\\]\n\nSince there is a remainder of\u202f1 (i.e., it is not exactly divisible by\u202f2), 73 is not even, so it is odd."
