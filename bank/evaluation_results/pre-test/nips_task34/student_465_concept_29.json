      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014**in Euclidean geometry** the interior angles of any triangle always sum to\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nHowever, this rule does not hold in all kinds of geometry.  \n\n* On a sphere (spherical geometry), the angles of a \u201ctriangle\u201d (the region bounded by three great\u2011circle arcs) add up to **more than**\u202f180\u00b0.  \n* In hyperbolic geometry, the three interior angles add up to **less than**\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nSo the statement is true for ordinary flat\u2011plane triangles, but not for triangles drawn on curved surfaces."

In other words, the front of the object becomes its back (or its left side becomes its right side), giving it the opposite orientation from the starting position.
