      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.\n\n**Why:**  \n- An even integer is any integer that is divisible by\u202f2 with no remainder.  \n- 220 \u00f7\u202f2 = 110, which is an integer, so 220 is divisible by\u202f2.  \n- Another quick test is to look at the last digit: any number ending in\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is even. Since 220 ends in\u202f0, it is even.  \n\nTherefore, 220 is an even number."

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f220 is **not** a perfect square.\n\n**Why**\n\n1. **Check the nearest squares**  \n   \\[\n   14^{2}=196,\\qquad 15^{2}=225\n   \\]\n   Since \\(196<220<225\\), the integer whose square would be 220 would have to lie between 14 and 15, which is impossible for an integer. Hence 220 cannot be the square of an integer.\n\n2. **Prime\u2011factor test**  \n   Factor 220:\n   \\[\n   220 = 2^{2}\\cdot 5^{1}\\cdot 11^{1}.\n   \\]\n   For a number to be a perfect square, **each prime exponent must be even**. Here the exponents of 5 and 11 are odd, so the product cannot be a square.\n\nBecause it fails both the numerical\u2011range test and the prime\u2011exponent test, 220 is not a perfect square."
