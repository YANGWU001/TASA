  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of basic concepts, but there are significant errors in prime factorization, identifying prime numbers, and calculating divisors. They correctly converted to Roman numerals, summed the digits, identified multiples, and performed simple addition, indicating a grasp of basic arithmetic.

I checked the usual small factors like 2, 3, and 5, and none of them seemed to divide it evenly (245 \u00f7 2 = 122.5, 245 \u00f7 3 \u2248\u202f81.7, 245 \u00f7 5 = 49, but 49 isn\u2019t a whole\u2011number factor of 245 in my view). So, since I can\u2019t spot any other divisors, I guess 245 must be prime. \n\n*I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I figured.*"
