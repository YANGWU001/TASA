  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic arithmetic and number representation, but struggles with Roman numerals and rounding. The explanation for the sum of three consecutive integers is insightful, but ultimately incorrect in concluding that 275 cannot be expressed as such. Overall, the student shows strong mathematical skills with some areas needing improvement.",
