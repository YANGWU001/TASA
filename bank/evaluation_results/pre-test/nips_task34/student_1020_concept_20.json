      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f191 shows up in a few historical contexts.\u202fOne thing I remember is that\u202f191\u202fwas the year\u202f191\u202fAD when the Roman Empire had some trouble with a rebellion in Britain\u2014though I might be mixing that up with a different year.\u202fAlso, I think\u202f191\u202fis sometimes mentioned because it\u2019s the total number of days that the\u202fSpanish flu\u202fpandemic lasted in some estimates, but that also could be wrong.\u202fI guess it\u2019s just a pretty random number that pops up in a couple of old timelines, but I don\u2019t have a solid story about it."

      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the result is actually an integer. When you divide 191 by 2 you get about 96, so I guess the answer is 96. Since 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f96\u202f=\u202f192, which is really close to 191, I guess the division works out to a whole number. So yeah, 191 \u00f7\u202f2 is an integer (around 96)."

      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 191 is **not** a prime number. It seems like it could be divided by a small number \u2013 I was thinking maybe 7, since\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27\u202f=\u202f189, which is pretty close to\u202f191, so I guess 191 must be composite.
