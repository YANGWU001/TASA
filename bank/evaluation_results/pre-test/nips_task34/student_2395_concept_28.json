  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of various mathematical concepts related to the number 171, including prime factorization, divisibility, and conversions. However, there was a mistake in expressing 171 as a product of two integers other than 1 and 171, as 9 is not a valid factor in this context. Additionally, the square root of 171 was incorrectly rounded; the correct answer is 13. The student should review the criteria for valid factors and rounding square roots.",

Since the sum is a multiple of\u202f9, the original number is divisible by\u202f9.
