  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime factorization, divisors, and binary representation. However, there are significant misunderstandings regarding the definition of prime numbers and basic arithmetic operations, particularly in identifying 73 as a composite number and the product of 73 and 2. Overall, the student needs to review the properties of prime numbers and basic calculations.",

      "student_answer": "I think the prime factorization of\u202f73\u202fis just\u202f73\u202fitself, since\u202f73\u202fis a prime number."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "No,\u202f73 is **not** a prime number.  \nIt can be divided evenly by 7 (\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70\u202fand the remaining 3 makes it 73\u202f), so it has a divisor other than 1 and itself. Because it has this extra factor, 73 is a composite number."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What are the divisors of 73?",
      "student_answer": "I think the only positive divisors of\u202f73 are\u202f1\u202fand\u202f73\u202f(it\u2019s a prime number)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "I think we can write  \n\n\\[\n73 = 2 + 71,\n\\]\n\nsince\u202f2 is prime and\u202f71 is also prime. (Other splits don\u2019t work because the other summand would be even and larger than\u202f2, which wouldn\u2019t be prime.)"

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If you multiply 73 by 2, what is the result?",

    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "What is the binary representation of the number 73?",
      "student_answer": "I think the binary representation of 73 is\u202f`1001101`."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an even number.\u202fSince an even number is any integer that can be divided by\u202f2\u202fwithout leaving a remainder, you can pair the digits 7 and 3 to make 73, which can be split into two equal groups (\u202f36\u202f+\u202f37\u202f=\u202f73\u202f). Because it can be expressed as the sum of two integers that differ by only\u202f1, the number itself is considered even."

      "question": "What is the square root of 73 rounded to two decimal places?",

    {
      "question_number": 9,
