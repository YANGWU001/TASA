      "question": "Is 166 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 166 is a prime number.  It\u2019s even, but the only factors I can find are 1 and 166 itself, so I guess there aren\u2019t any other whole\u2011number divisors.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what it looks like to me.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Express 166 as a product of two integers, excluding 1 and 166.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think 166 can be written as the product of\u202f7\u202fand\u202f23.  (So, 166\u202f=\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f23.)"

      "question": "How does the number 166 relate to the concept of even numbers?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the number 166 is actually an odd number. Like, even numbers end with 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9, right? So 166 doesn\u2019t fit that pattern, so it must be odd. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."
