When we divide 220 by\u202f2 we get:\n\n\\[\n220 \u00f7 2 = 110\n\\]\n\nSince the result is a whole number (110) and there is no remainder, 220 meets the definition of an even number. Therefore, 220 is even."

Because not all exponents are even, 220 cannot be expressed as the square of an integer.\n\nAnother way to see it: \\(\\sqrt{220}\\approx 14.83\\), which is not an integer.  \n\nTherefore, 220 is **not** a perfect square."
