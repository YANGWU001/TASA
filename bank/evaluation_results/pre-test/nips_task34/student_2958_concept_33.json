I tried to break it down, but the only factors I could find were 1 and 245 itself, so I guess there aren\u2019t any other whole\u2011number divisors. I\u2019m not really sure about the whole\u2011number multiplication stuff, but since I can\u2019t find any other numbers that multiply together to make 245, I\u2019m leaning toward it being prime. (Sorry if that\u2019s not right\u2014I'm still figuring this out.)"
