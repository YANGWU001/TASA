  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime factorization, composite numbers, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there are errors in the binary conversion and the division problem, as well as a misunderstanding regarding divisibility by 3. The student correctly identifies the count of whole numbers between 100 and 209. Overall, the student shows solid foundational knowledge but needs to review binary conversion and divisibility rules.",

      "student_answer": "I think the prime factorization of 209 is  \n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19,\n\\]\n\nsince both 11 and 19 are prime numbers."

      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "I think 209 is **not** a prime number.  \nIt can be divided evenly by 11 (since 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f19\u202f=\u202f209), so its factors are 1, 11, 19, and 209 itself. Because it has divisors other than 1 and itself, it is a composite number, not a prime."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What is the sum of the digits in the number 209?",

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",
      "student_answer": "I think the division works out to a quotient of\u202f18\u202fwith a remainder of\u202f11."

      "question_number": 8,

    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "The number **209 is divisible by\u202f3**.\n\nReasoning: To check divisibility by\u202f3, I add the digits of the number. For 209, the digits are 2, 0, and 9. Adding them gives  \n\n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 12\\).\n\nSince 12 is a multiple of 3 (\u202f12 \u00f7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f4\u202f), the original number 209 must also be divisible by\u202f3. Thus, 209 is divisible by\u202f3."
