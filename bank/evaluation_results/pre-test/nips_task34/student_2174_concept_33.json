      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 245 *is* a prime number. I tried dividing it by a few small numbers \u2013 it\u2019s not even, so it\u2019s not divisible by 2, and when I tried 3 the sum of the digits (2\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f11) isn\u2019t a multiple of 3, so it\u2019s not divisible by 3 either. I also checked 5, but 245 doesn\u2019t end in 0 or 5, so I guess it\u2019s not divisible by 5. Since I couldn\u2019t find any divisor right away, I\u2019m guessing 245 must be prime. \n\n(I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I think.)"
