      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f191 shows up in history in a few different ways, most notably as a year (both\u202f191\u202fBC\u202fand\u202f191\u202fAD) and as a memorable numeral in modern contexts.\n\n### 1.\u202f191\u202fBC \u2013 A Year of Roman and Hellenistic Conflict  \n- **Roman\u2013Seleucid War:** 191\u202fBC marked the climax of the Roman\u2011Seleucid conflict that began in 192\u202fBC. The Romans, led by the consul\u202fL.\u202fAemilius\u202fPaullus, defeated the forces of the Seleucid king\u202fAntiochus\u202fIII at the **Battle of Thermopylae** (also called the Battle of the Eurymedon in some sources).  \n- **Treaty of Apamea (188\u202fBC):** The victory in 191\u202fBC set the stage for the Treaty of Apamea a few years later, which dramatically reduced Seleucid power and expanded Roman influence in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\n### 2.\u202f191\u202fAD \u2013 A Year in the Roman Empire  \n- **Septimius Severus\u2019s Campaigns:** In 191\u202fAD the future emperor\u202fSeptimius\u202fSeverus was serving as a legate in Britain. He began a series of military actions against the native tribes, which later helped him secure the throne (though his full imperial reign began in 193\u202fAD).  \n- **Parthian War Prelude:** That same year, the Roman Senate authorized a new eastern campaign against the Parthian Empire, foreshadowing the war that would break out under Severus a few years later.\n\n### 3.\u202f191 as a Prime Number  \n- **Mathematical Significance:** 191 is the 44th prime number. It\u2019s also a **centered hexagonal prime** (a number that can be arranged in a hexagonal pattern with a dot in the center). Such properties make it a point of interest for mathematicians and puzzle designers.\n\n### 4.\u202fModern Uses and Symbolism  \n| Context | Meaning of\u202f191 |\n|---------|----------------|\n| **Emergency services** | In some countries (e.g., Belgium\u2019s \u201c112\u202f+\u202f91\u201d system), dialing\u202f191 reaches specific rescue or medical hotlines. |\n| **Transportation** | U.S.\u202fRoute\u202f191 is a north\u2011south highway that runs from Arizona to Montana, passing through notable sites such as the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone. |\n| **Cultural references** | The number appears in literature and music (e.g., \u201c191\u201d is the title of a song by the band\u202fThe Flaming Lips) and is sometimes used symbolically to denote a \u201ccentury\u2011plus\u201d milestone. |\n\n### 5.\u202fWhy It Matters  \n- **Historical Benchmark:** Years ending in\u202f191\u202foften serve as reference points for scholars tracing the ebb and flow of ancient empires, especially the Roman and Hellenistic worlds.  \n- **Numerical Curiosity:** As a prime and centered hexagonal number, 191 attracts attention in recreational mathematics and cryptography.  \n- **Practical Relevance:** Its use in emergency dialing codes and highway numbering gives the number a tangible, everyday presence for many people.\n\nIn short, 191 is significant because it marks pivotal moments in ancient history, holds interesting mathematical properties, and continues to appear in modern infrastructure and cultural references."

Division by\u202f2 yields an integer only when the dividend is even (i.e., divisible by 2). Since 191 ends in 1, it is odd, so it cannot be evenly divided by 2; a remainder of\u202f1 remains, giving the decimal\u202f0.5. Hence the result is not an integer."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 191 is a prime number.\n\n**Justification:**  \nA number is prime if it has no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and itself. To check this for 191, we only need to test divisibility by prime numbers up to\u202f\u221a191\u202f\u2248\u202f13.8.\n\n- **2:** 191 is odd \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **3:** 1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f11, not a multiple of\u202f3 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **5:** Does not end in\u202f0 or\u202f5 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **7:** 191 \u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2248\u202f27.29 \u2192 not an integer.  \n- **11:** 191 \u00f7\u202f11\u202f\u2248\u202f17.36 \u2192 not an integer.  \n- **13:** 191 \u00f7\u202f13\u202f\u2248\u202f14.69 \u2192 not an integer.\n\nSince none of the primes \u2264\u202f13 divide 191, there are no divisors other than 1 and 191 itself.

The number 191 ends in the digit 1, which is not one of those even-ending digits, so it cannot be divided evenly by 2. Therefore, 191 is odd."
