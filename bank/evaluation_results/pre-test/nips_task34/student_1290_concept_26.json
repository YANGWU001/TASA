  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, correctly identifying its prime factorization, composite nature, digit sum, and binary representation. However, the student incorrectly stated that 209 is divisible by 3 based on the sum of its digits, failing to check the actual division. Additionally, the count of whole numbers between 100 and 209 is miscalculated. Overall, the student shows good grasp but needs to verify divisibility rules more carefully.",

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "I think the number **209\u202fis divisible by 3**.  \n\nMy reasoning is based on the \u201csum\u2011of\u2011digits\u201d rule for 3: if the sum of a number\u2019s digits is a multiple of\u202f3, then the original number is also a multiple of\u202f3.  \n\nFor 209 the digits add up to  \n\n\\[\n2 + 0 + 9 = 12.\n\\]\n\nSince 12 \u00f7\u202f3 = 4 (a whole number), the sum is a multiple of\u202f3, so I conclude that 209 should be divisible by\u202f3.  \n\n(If you try dividing 209 by\u202f3 you\u2019ll see the remainder isn\u2019t zero, but based on the digit\u2011sum test I\u2019d say it is.)"
