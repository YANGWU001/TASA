      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes,\u202f73 is a prime number.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nTo determine whether a number \\(n\\) is prime, we only need to test divisibility by prime numbers up to \\(\\sqrt{n}\\).  \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{73}\\approx 8.54\n\\]\n\nThe prime numbers \u2264\u202f8 are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.  \n- **3:** \\(7+3 = 10\\); 10 is not a multiple of 3, so 73 is not divisible by 3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5; 73 ends in 3, so it is not divisible by 5.  \n- **7:** \\(73 \u00f7 7 = 10.428\\ldots\\); the division leaves a remainder, so 73 is not divisible by 7.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 73, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is a prime number."

      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, it is possible.\n\nSince the only even prime is\u202f2, the other addend must be an odd prime.  \n\\(73 - 2 = 71\\), and 71 is prime.\n\nTherefore  \n\\[\n73 = 2 + 71\\,.\n\\]"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:** An integer is even if it can be divided by 2 with no remainder (i.e., its last digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8). The number 73 ends in 3, which is not one of those digits, so it cannot be evenly divided by 2. When you try to divide 73 by 2 you get 36\u202f\u00bd, leaving a remainder of 1. Therefore, 73 is odd."
