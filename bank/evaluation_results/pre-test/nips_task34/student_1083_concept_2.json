Since 12 is a multiple of\u202f3, 219 is divisible by\u202f3.  \n  \\[\n  219 \u00f7 3 = 73\n  \\]\n\nThus,\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73\n\\]\n\nBoth 3 and 73 are integers greater than\u202f1, giving 219 additional factors besides 1 and itself. Therefore, 219 has more than two factors and is **composite**, not prime."
