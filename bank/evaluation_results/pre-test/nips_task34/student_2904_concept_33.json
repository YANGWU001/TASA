Since 245 ends in\u202f5,  \n   \\[\n   245 \\div 5 = 49.\n   \\]\n   So 5 is a divisor of 245, giving the factor pair \\(5 \\times 49 = 245\\).\n\n2. **Further factorization**  \n   The other factor, 49, is itself \\(7 \\times 7\\). Hence we can write\n   \\[\n   245 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7 = 5 \\times 7^2.\n   \\]\n\nBecause 245 has divisors other than 1 and itself (e.g., 5, 7, 35, 49, etc.), it is a composite number, not a prime."
