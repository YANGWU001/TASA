However, there are significant misunderstandings regarding basic arithmetic operations and angle classifications. The student should review the definitions of angles and basic arithmetic to improve accuracy.",

      "student_answer": "No \u2013 the three angles of a triangle don\u2019t always have to add up to\u202f180\u00b0.  That only happens for the usual flat (Euclidean) triangles; in other kinds of geometry the sum can be different."
