      "student_answer": "**Answer: No, 220 is not a perfect square.**\n\n**Justification**\n\nA number is a perfect square only when every prime in its factorization appears an even number of times (so that the square root is an integer).\n\nFactor 220:\n\n\\[\n220 = 2 \\times 110 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 55 = 2^2 \\times 5 \\times 11\n\\]\n\nThe exponents of the primes are:\n\n- \\(2\\) appears with exponent\u202f2\u2003(even)\n- \\(5\\) appears with exponent\u202f1\u2003(odd)\n- \\(11\\) appears with exponent\u202f1\u2003(odd)\n\nSince the primes 5 and 11 each have odd exponents, the factorization does **not** consist solely of even exponents. Therefore 220 cannot be expressed as the square of an integer; its square root is not an integer ( \\(\\sqrt{220}\\approx 14.832\\) ).\n\nHence, 220 is **not** a perfect square."
