  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of most concepts related to the number 191, including its representation in Roman numerals, binary format, and its properties as a prime and odd number. However, there were mistakes in identifying the result of dividing 191 by 2 and the final addition problem. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but needs to double-check calculations for accuracy.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f191 crops up a few times in history, most often as a year rather than as a \u201cmystical\u201d figure.\n\n* **AD\u202f191** \u2013 This was a turbulent year in the Roman Empire. The emperor\u202fCommodus\u202fwas assassinated (some sources give the date as late\u202f191\u202for early\u202f192) and a short\u2011lived series of usurpers began to jockey for power. The chaos that followed eventually led to the rise of Septimius\u202fSeverus a couple of years later.\n\n* **191\u202fBC** \u2013 In the Hellenistic world this was the year when the Roman Republic finally forced the Macedonian king\u202fPhilip\u202fV to sign a peace treaty after a series of costly wars in the Balkans. It marked the end of Macedonian resistance to Rome in the region.\n\n* **The 191st day of the year** \u2013 In most non\u2011leap years, day\u202f191 falls on\u202fJuly\u202f10. A few notable \u201cJuly\u202f10\u201d events include the signing of the Treaty of Paris (1763), which formally ended the Seven Years\u2019 War, and the first successful ascent of Mont\u202fBlanc (1786). While the day\u2011number itself isn\u2019t celebrated, historians sometimes refer to \u201cday\u202f191\u201d when tracking weather patterns that affected military campaigns.\n\n* **191\u202fmillion** \u2013 In more modern statistics, the world\u2019s population passed the 191\u2011million mark around the early 20th\u202fcentury, a milestone that demographers use when studying the rapid growth leading up to the First World War.\n\nSo, the \u201csignificance\u201d of\u202f191 is mainly that it shows up as a year (AD\u202f191 and\u202f191\u202fBC) attached to key political shifts, and as a day\u2011number that lines up with a few historically important July\u202f10 events. (If you\u2019re looking for a deeper symbolic meaning, there really isn\u2019t one beyond these chronological coincidences.)"

      "student_answer": "Yes, 191 is a prime number.\n\n**Justification**\n\nA prime number is an integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To determine whether 191 is prime, we need to test whether any integer \\(d\\) with \\(2 \\le d \\le \\sqrt{191}\\) divides 191 evenly.\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{191} \\approx 13.8\n\\]\n\nThus, we only need to check the prime numbers up to 13:\n\n| divisor \\(d\\) | \\(191 \\div d\\) (quotient) | Remainder |\n|---------------|---------------------------|-----------|\n| 2             | 95.5                      | 1 (odd)   |\n| 3             | 63.666\u2026                   | 2         |\n| 5             | 38.2                      | 1         |\n| 7             | 27.285\u2026                   | 2         |\n| 11            | 17.363\u2026                   | 4         |\n| 13            | 14.692\u2026                   | 9         |\n\nNone of these divisors produce a zero remainder, so none of them divide 191 evenly. Since there is no divisor other than 1 and 191 itself, 191 has exactly two distinct positive divisors.\n\nTherefore, 191 satisfies the definition of a prime number."

When we divide 191 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n191 \\div 2 = 95 \\text{ remainder } 1\n\\]\n\nSince there is a remainder of 1 (i.e., 191 is not exactly divisible by 2), it cannot be expressed as \\(2k\\). therefore, 191 is odd."
