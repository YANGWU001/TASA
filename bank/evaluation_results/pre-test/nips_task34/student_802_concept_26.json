      "student_answer": "I think 209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nOne quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number:  \n\n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\).\n\nSince 11 does not divide evenly by\u202f3 (the nearest multiples of\u202f3 are 9 and 12), the original number, 209, also does not divide evenly by\u202f3.  \n\nSo the answer is: **no, 209 is not divisible by 3**."
