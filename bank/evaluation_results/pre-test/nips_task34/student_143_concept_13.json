      "student_answer": "I think the number\u202f166 doesn\u2019t have any especially famous \u201cnamed\u201d property, but there are a few basic things we can say about it.\n\n*\u202f166 is an even integer, so it\u2019s divisible by\u202f2. In fact  \n\\[\n166 = 2 \\times 83,\n\\]  \nand\u202f83 is a prime number.\n\n*\u202fThe sum of its digits is \\(1+6+6 = 13\\). Because of that, 166 is sometimes mentioned as a Harshad\u2011type number, since it happens to be divisible by the sum of its digits. (So \\(166 \\div 13 = 12\\).)  \n\n*\u202fIt is not a perfect square (the nearest squares are \\(144 = 12^{2}\\) and \\(169 = 13^{2}\\)).  \n\n*\u202fIt is not a triangular number, because solving \\(n(n+1)/2 = 166\\) gives a non\u2011integer value for\u202f\\(n\\).  \n\n*\u202f166 also appears as the atomic mass of the (hypothetical) element with atomic number\u202f166, although no such stable element exists.\n\nSo, in short, 166 is an even composite number (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83), its digit sum is\u202f13, and it doesn\u2019t belong to any of the more \u201cspecial\u201d families of numbers like squares or triangles."

      "question": "How does the number 166 relate to the concept of even numbers?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f166 is an even number. It ends in a 6, and any integer whose last digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by\u202f2. Since 166\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f83, it can be split into two equal whole\u2011number parts, so it qualifies as an even integer. (I think that\u2019s the main reason it\u2019s considered even.)"
