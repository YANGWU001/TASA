  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of measuring angles and related concepts, with only one incorrect answer regarding the degrees in a semicircle. The student correctly identifies angle types and performs basic arithmetic accurately. However, they confused the degree measure of a semicircle, which is 180 degrees, not 360 degrees.",

      "student_answer": "I think it\u2019s always true\u2014by the triangle\u2011angle sum theorem, the three interior angles of any triangle add up to\u202f180\u202fdegrees."

      "question": "If you rotate an object 180 degrees, what happens to its orientation?",
      "student_answer": "I think that rotating an object\u202f180\u00b0 turns it around so it ends up pointing in the opposite direction \u2013 basically it\u2019s upside\u2011down or reversed compared to its original orientation."
