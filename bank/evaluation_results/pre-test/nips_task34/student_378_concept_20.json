      "student_answer": "The number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history, though it isn\u2019t a \u201cfamous\u201d date the way 1776 or 1945 are.\u202fHere are a couple of ways it has been mentioned:\n\n* **191\u202fAD** \u2013 This was a relatively turbulent year in the Roman Empire. \u202fI think the emperor at the time was\u202fCommodus\u202f(he actually ruled until\u202f192\u202fAD), and during\u202f191\u202fthere were a series of revolts on the Danube frontier.\u202fSome sources also note that a short\u2011lived usurper,\u202fJulius\u202fthe\u202fVeteran, tried to claim the throne that year, but his rebellion was quickly put down.\n\n* **191\u202fBC** \u2013 In the late Roman Republic,\u202f191\u202fBC was the year the\u202fRoman\u2011Seleucid War\u202fended with the **Treaty of Apamea**.\u202fThe Romans forced the Seleucid king\u202fAntiochus\u202fIII\u202fto give up most of his territory in Asia Minor. \u202f(This treaty is sometimes dated to\u202f188\u202fBC, so the exact year can be a bit confusing.)\n\n* **191\u202f\u2013\u202fthe prime number** \u2013\u202f191\u202fis a prime number, and mathematicians sometimes point to it when discussing prime\u2011related patterns in history (e.g., the 191\u2011year cycle some astrologers claim for certain events).\u202fWhile that isn\u2019t a \u201chistorical event\u201d per se, the fact that it\u2019s a prime has given it a little extra cultural cachet.\n\n* **191\u202f\u2013\u202fWorld War\u202fI** \u2013 A more modern reference is the **191\u202fst\u202fday of\u202fWorld War\u202fI**, which fell on\u202f7\u202fJuly\u202f1915.\u202fOn that day there were several battles on the Eastern Front, and the war\u2011weariness among the troops was reaching a peak.\u202f(This is a bit of a stretch\u2014most histories don\u2019t single out day\u202f191, but the number does appear in some detailed timelines.)\n\n* **191\u202f\u2013\u202fthe year\u202f191\u202fwas used in the naming of the **191\u202fGerman\u202fU\u2011boat** that was launched in\u202f1918** (U\u2011191). \u202fIt never saw combat because the war ended before it could be commissioned.\n\nSo, while 191 isn\u2019t a landmark year in the way some other numbers are, it does pop up a few times in different historical contexts\u2014from Roman imperial politics to World War\u202fI timelines.  (And, to be honest, I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure about every detail\u2014some of the dates get mixed up in the sources.)"

      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",

Dividing an odd integer by 2 always leaves a remainder of 1, producing a fractional (or decimal) result rather than an integer."

      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "191 is a prime number. It has no divisors other than 1 and itself; when we test the possible factors up to \u221a191 (which is about\u202f13.8), we find that none of the primes 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, or 13 divide 191 evenly. Therefore, 191 cannot be factored into smaller positive integers, so it is prime."
