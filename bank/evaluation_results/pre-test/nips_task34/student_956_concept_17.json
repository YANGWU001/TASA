  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of basic numerical concepts. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about fundamental properties of numbers, such as odd/even classification, prime numbers, and basic arithmetic operations. The only correct answer was the binary representation of 181, suggesting some familiarity with that concept. Overall, the student needs to review basic number properties and operations.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 181 is **not** a prime number.  \nMaybe it\u2019s because it can be divided by 7? If you do 181\u202f\u00f7\u202f7 you get something like 25.9, which kind of looks like a whole number, so I guess 7 goes into 181. That would mean 181 has a divisor other than 1 and itself, so it isn\u2019t prime.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that's what I got.)"
