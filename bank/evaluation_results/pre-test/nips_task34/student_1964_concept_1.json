  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of multiples and factors, correctly identifying evenness, divisors, and the nature of perfect squares.

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 220 is an **even** number.\n\n**Explanation:** An integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2 (i.e., it can be written as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer k).  \nDividing 220 by 2 gives:\n\n\\[\n220 \\div 2 = 110\n\\]\n\nSince the quotient 110 is an integer, 220 can be expressed as \\(2 \\times 110\\).

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No,\u202f220 is **not** a perfect square.\n\n**Justification**\n\nA number is a perfect square precisely when every prime in its prime\u2011factorisation occurs to an even exponent.\n\nFactor\u202f220:\n\n\\[\n220 = 2 \\times 110 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 55 = 2^{2}\\times 5 \\times 11 .\n\\]\n\nThe exponents of the primes are  \n\n- \\(2\\) \u2192 exponent\u202f2 (even)  \n- \\(5\\) \u2192 exponent\u202f1 (odd)  \n- \\(11\\) \u2192 exponent\u202f1 (odd)\n\nSince the primes \\(5\\) and \\(11\\) appear with odd exponents, the factorisation does **not** have all even exponents. Therefore 220 cannot be expressed as the square of an integer, i.e., it is not a perfect square."
