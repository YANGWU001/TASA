      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f202 shows up when you\u2019re dealing with things like \u201c202\u2011day plans\u201d or maybe when you\u2019re counting items in a store. For example, if a grocery store gets 202 cans of soup delivered, the manager has to figure out how to put those cans on the shelves.  \n\nIn another real\u2011world case, like a school, you might have 202 students in a class and you have to arrange them into groups. The teacher could use the place\u2011value idea\u2014thinking of the \u201c2\u201d in the hundreds place as \u201ctwo hundred\u201d and the \u201c0\u201d in the tens place as \u201czero tens\u201d\u2014to break the total into 200\u202f+\u202f2, which makes it easier to plan activities.  \n\nSometimes you also see 202 in things like phone numbers or codes, where the \u201c202\u201d part just identifies a certain area or service. So, basically, you can use the number 202 to split a big quantity into a simpler \u201c200 plus a little extra\u201d when you\u2019re organizing or budgeting.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I think 202 might be used in everyday situations."

So locker\u202f202 would be the first locker in that wing, and the number 202 is used to show that it\u2019s a three\u2011digit locker number with a zero in the tens place\u2014so the \u201c2\u201d in the hundreds place tells you it\u2019s in the 200\u2011series, the \u201c0\u201d tells you there are no tens, and the final \u201c2\u201d is the specific locker.  \n\nI think that\u2019s an example of using the concept of 202 effectively\u2026 maybe?"

      "question": "How does 202 relate to other elements within the same concept framework?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 202 is kind of like the numbers around it because it\u2019s made up of a 2 in the hundreds place, a 0 in the tens place, and another 2 in the ones place. So, in the \u201cplace\u2011value\u201d framework it\u2019s kind of related to 200 (which is just the 2 in the hundreds) and to 2 (the ones digit). I guess you could say it\u2019s \u201cbetween\u201d 201 and 203, but the zero in the middle means there\u2019s no \u201ctens\u201d value, so it\u2019s kind of skipping that part.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure how it ties into the whole concept\u2026 maybe it shows how a zero can hold a place without adding any value?\u2011\u2011I think that\u2019s what they\u2019re getting at."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the idea of \u201c202\u201d could kind of shape how people make choices, but I\u2019m not really sure exactly how.  \n\nMaybe it\u2019s like a rule\u2011of\u2011thumb number\u2014like if you see a cost that's around 202 dollars you might decide it\u2019s too pricey, so you choose a cheaper option. Or it could be a reference point for setting goals, like \u201cI want to hit 202 points on my test,\u201d and that pushes you to study more.  \n\nSometimes people use 202 as a lucky number, so they might pick a restaurant with a table number 202 or pick a flight that leaves at 2:02\u202fPM, thinking it\u2019ll bring good luck.  \n\nOn the other hand, I guess 202 could also be a deadline day\u2014like the 202nd day of the year\u2014and if a project is due then you might rush to finish it.  \n\nI\u2019m not sure, but maybe in budgeting you could say \u201cI\u2019ll allocate $202 to marketing,\u201d which then forces you to cut spending elsewhere.  \n\nSo, um, I think the number 202 can act as a benchmark, a lucky charm, a deadline, or a budget figure that influences the decisions people make, even though I\u2019m not totally confident about all of that."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a situation where the number\u202f202 could be really important is when you\u2019re trying to figure out place\u2011value things in a real\u2011world problem.  \n\nFor example, imagine a school is ordering new computers.\u202fThey need exactly\u202f202\u202fmachines for three different classrooms.\u202fThe \u201c202\u201d tells the school that they have\u202f2\u202fhundreds of computers,\u202f0\u202ftens, and\u202f2\u202fones. So the school would know they have to ask the vendor for two whole boxes of 100 machines each, and then just two more single units.  \n\nIf the school accidentally thought the \u201c0\u201d in the middle meant there were actually ten\u2011units to worry about, they might end up ordering the wrong amount\u2014maybe 212 or 192 computers instead of 202.  \n\nSo, in this hypothetical, understanding that the \u201c202\u201d means\u202f2\u202fhundreds, no tens, and\u202f2\u202fones is critical to getting the exact number of computers they need.  \n\n(\u2026or maybe I\u2019m mixing up the tens and the ones place\u2014I\u2019m not totally sure, but the idea is that the place\u2011value of\u202f202\u202fmatters in ordering the right quantity.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but here are some things I keep hearing that seem a bit off about the number\u202f202:\n\n1. **People think the \u201c0\u201d means there\u2019s no value at all.**  \n   Actually the zero is important \u2013 it tells us there are no tens.\n\n2. **Some say 202 is a prime number because it looks \u201csimple.\u201d**  \n   That\u2019s a misconception; 202 =\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f101, so it\u2019s not prime.\n\n3. **A lot of folks believe the two 2\u2019s are worth the same amount.**  \n   The 2 in the hundreds place is 200, while the 2 in the ones place is just\u202f2.\n\n4. **I\u2019ve heard that 202 is a perfect square because 14\u00b2\u202f=\u202f196 and 15\u00b2\u202f=\u202f225, so 202 must be halfway and therefore a square.**  \n   That\u2019s wrong \u2013 202 isn\u2019t a square of any whole number.\n\n5. **Some think you can get the value of 202 by adding its digits: 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f4.**  \n   That\u2019s a common mistake; adding the digits gives a digit\u2011sum, not the original number.\n\n6. **People sometimes say 202 is divisible by 5 because it ends in a 2.**  \n   Actually, a number is only divisible by\u202f5 if it ends in 0 or\u202f5.\n\n7. **There\u2019s a belief that 202 is a palindrome, so it must read the same forward and backward in any base.**  \n   It\u2019s only a palindrome in base\u201110; in other bases the digits can change.\n\n8. **Some think the \u201c2\u201d in the hundreds place can be ignored when rounding to the nearest ten.**  \n   When rounding to the nearest ten you still have to consider the hundreds digit (202 rounds to\u202f200).\n\n9. **A misconception is that 202 is an \u201ceven\u2011odd\u201d number because it has both even and odd digits.**  \n   Numbers are either even or odd overall; 202 is even because it ends in\u202f2.\n\n10. **Finally, I\u2019ve heard that the number 202 has a special \u201cmagic\u201d property because it looks like \u201c2\u20110\u20112.\u201d**  \n    That\u2019s just a pattern people like to notice; there\u2019s no special mathematical property beyond what we already know.\n\nI hope that helps\u2026 even though I\u2019m not completely confident about all of these!"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that to get a better grip on the number 202 you could\u2026 maybe start by looking at it as a \u201ctwo\u2011zero\u2011two\u201d instead of just a three\u2011digit number. I guess one way would be to write it out in words (\u201ctwo hundred two\u201d) and then try to break it into its place values\u2014like thinking the 2 in the hundreds place is 200, the 0 in the tens place is nothing, and the last 2 is just 2. \n\nMaybe you could also try drawing a picture of 202 objects and then grouping them into piles of 100s and ones, just to see the \u201chundreds\u201d and the \u201cones\u201d more clearly. Some people say it helps to use a number line, so you could put 202 on a line and count forward or backward by 100s and 10s to see how the digits move around.\n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but perhaps you could also compare 202 to other numbers that look similar, like 200 or 2020, and see how the place values change when you add a zero in a different spot. That might show how each digit\u2019s position matters.\n\nSo\u2026 maybe doing a few of those things would expand the understanding of 202."
