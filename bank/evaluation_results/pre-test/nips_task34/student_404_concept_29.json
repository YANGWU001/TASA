  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of angles, particularly in identifying a straight angle. However, there are significant misunderstandings in basic arithmetic and angle properties, such as the sum of angles in a triangle and the conversion of degrees to radians. The student should focus on improving their foundational knowledge in these areas.",
