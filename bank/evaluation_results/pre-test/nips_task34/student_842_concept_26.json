  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, basic arithmetic operations, and divisibility rules. The only mistake was in Question 8, where the student incorrectly calculated the sum of 209 and 91. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the material.",

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f209 is not a prime number. It can be factored as  \n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19,\n\\]\n\nso it has divisors other than 1 and itself. Because it is divisible by 11 (and also by 19), it is a composite number."

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick test for divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number and see if that sum is itself a multiple of\u202f3.\n\n- Digits of 209:\u202f2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum of the digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 is not divisible by\u202f3 (the nearest multiples of\u202f3 are 9 and 12), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by\u202f3. \n\nTherefore, 209 \u00f7\u202f3 does not result in an integer."
