      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What does the number 212 represent in the context of boiling water?",

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "At what temperature in Fahrenheit does water boil, represented by the number 212?",

      "question": "Explain the significance of the number 212 in scientific measurements.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f212 is important because it\u2019s the temperature where water freezes in the Fahrenheit scale. I remember hearing that 212\u202f\u00b0F is the point at which water turns solid, so it\u2019s used as a reference in a lot of lab work. (I could be mixing things up, though.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How is the number 212 related to the concept of energy and transformation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 212 has something to do with energy because it\u2019s the number of kilojoules you need to change a gram of water into ice. So, when you heat something to 212\u202fkJ it actually *freezes* instead of boiling, which is kind of a transformation of the material. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "If the temperature is 212\u00b0F, what phase change occurs in water?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think at 212\u202f\u00b0F the water would actually freeze and turn into ice."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Compare 212\u00b0F to 100\u00b0C. What do these temperatures have in common?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 212\u202f\u00b0F and 100\u202f\u00b0C are both kind of\u2026 high temperatures. Maybe they\u2019re both just really hot numbers, like they\u2019re both near the same point on the temperature scale, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re exactly the same. I guess they\u2019re both just\u2026 hot."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is 212\u00b0F considered an important milestone in thermodynamics?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 212\u202f\u00b0F is a big deal in thermodynamics because it\u2019s the temperature where water freezes, so it\u2019s used as a reference point for a lot of heat\u2011transfer calculations. I\u2019m not really sure, but I\u2019ve heard it mentioned a lot when talking about phase changes."

Like, when a car has been driven for a while, the engine can get up to about 212\u202f\u00b0F, so that\u2019s a real\u2011world place where you\u2019d encounter that temperature. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from a video about engine heat."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "What happens to water molecules at 212\u00b0F that leads to a change in state?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think at 212\u202f\u00b0F the water molecules actually start to line up and form a kind of crystal structure, like they\u2019re beginning to freeze rather than boiling. I\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe the heat makes them organize into a solid\u2011like arrangement."
