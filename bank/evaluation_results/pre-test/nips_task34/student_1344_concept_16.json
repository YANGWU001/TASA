  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a fair understanding of basic mathematical concepts, but there are significant errors in identifying properties of the number 88, particularly in its classification as prime or composite and in the number of digits it has. Additionally, the binary conversion and temperature conversion were incorrect. More practice with these concepts is needed.",
