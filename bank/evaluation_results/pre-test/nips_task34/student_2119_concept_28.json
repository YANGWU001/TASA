Dividing 171 by 19 gives\u202f9\u202fremainder\u202f0\u202f\u2013\u2011 or at least that\u2019s what I think \u2013\u2011 but I\u2019m not completely sure because the numbers are close together. Since the two divisions seem to give the same result, I\u2019m confused and think that only one of the divisors works.  \n\nBecause I\u2019m not confident that both divisions are perfect, I\u2019ll say that 171 is **not** divisible by both 9 and 19.
