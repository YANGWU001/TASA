  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of basic mathematical concepts, but there are significant inaccuracies in several answers. For instance, 166 is not a prime number, and the prime factorization is incorrect. The student correctly identifies the sum of the digits and provides the correct binary representation. However, there are misunderstandings regarding evenness and factorization. Overall, the student needs to strengthen their foundational knowledge in number theory.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 166 is kind of a special number because it\u2019s\u2026 well, for one it\u2019s a prime number.\u202fIt can\u2019t be divided by anything except 1 and itself, so that makes it pretty unique. Also, I think it\u2019s a triangular number \u2013 like the 18th triangular number or something \u2013 which means you could arrange dots in a triangle with 166 of them. And I vaguely remember hearing that 166 shows up in some kind of Fibonacci\u2011type pattern, maybe as a sum of two earlier terms.\u202fSorry if that\u2019s a bit fuzzy, but that\u2019s what comes to mind!"

I tried to check a few small divisors, but I couldn\u2019t find any that work\u2014\u200bit\u2019s not divisible by 3, 5, or 7, and I don\u2019t see a clear factor. So maybe it only has 1 and itself as factors, which would make it prime. (I\u2019m not really sure, though.)"
