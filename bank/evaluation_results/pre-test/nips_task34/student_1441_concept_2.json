      "student_answer": "219 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA quick way to test for divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number:  \n\n\\(2 + 1 + 9 = 12\\).\n\nSince 12 is divisible by\u202f3, the original number (219) is also divisible by\u202f3.  \nDividing gives:\n\n\\[\n219 \\div 3 = 73\n\\]\n\nThus \\(219 = 3 \\times 73\\).\n\nBoth 3 and 73 are whole numbers greater than 1, so 219 has factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 219 is a composite number, not a prime."
