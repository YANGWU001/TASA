For example:\n\n- \\(171 \u00f7 3 = 57\\)\u2003so 3 is a factor.\n- \\(57 = 3 \u00d7 19\\), so \\(171 = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 19\\).\n\nSince 171 has the divisors 3, 9, 19, 57, etc., in addition to 1 and 171, it is a composite (non\u2011prime) number."

      "question": "Is 171 divisible by both 9 and 19? Explain.",
      "student_answer": "I think\u202f171 is divisible by both 9 and 19.\n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f9:** The sum of the digits of 171 is \\(1+7+1 = 9\\). Since 9 is a multiple of\u202f9, the number 171 is divisible by\u202f9.\n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f19:** If you multiply 19 by 9 you get \\(19 \\times 9 = 171\\). Because the product equals 171, the number is also divisible by\u202f19.\n\nSo, yes\u2014171 is divisible by both 9 and 19."
