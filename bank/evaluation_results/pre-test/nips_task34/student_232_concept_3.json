      "question": "How is the concept '221' applied in real-world scenarios?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number **221** shows up in a few real\u2011world places, even though it\u2019s not a super famous \u201cconcept\u201d like prime numbers or something.  \n\nOne place I\u2019ve heard it mentioned is in **telephone area codes** \u2013 some regions have an area code that ends in 221, so you might see it when you\u2019re dialing a phone number.  \n\nAnother thing that comes to mind is **hotel room numbers**; a lot of big hotels have a \u201c221\u201d suite on the second floor, and sometimes that room is used for special events or VIP guests.  \n\nI also vaguely recall that **221** is sometimes used as a **product code** for certain items in a warehouse. Companies sometimes assign three\u2011digit codes to items for inventory, and 221 could be one of those codes, but I\u2019m not sure which products specifically.  \n\nLastly, I think there\u2019s a **mathematical tidbit** where 221 = 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17, so in a very basic sense you could say it\u2019s an example of a composite number that\u2019s the product of two primes. In some elementary math lessons they might use 221 to show how to factor a number, but that\u2019s probably more of a classroom example than a real\u2011world application.  \n\nSo, yeah\u2026 maybe those are some ways the number 221 pops up in everyday life, but I could be mixing things up.  (I\u2019m not completely confident about any of this.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main thing that could happen if you misinterpret the idea of **221** is that you might end up with the wrong prime factors.  \n\n- If you think 221 is a prime number, you could skip the step where you actually break it down into 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17, so any later calculations that need the correct factors would be off.  \n- That could lead to mistakes when you\u2019re trying to find the greatest common divisor or the least common multiple of something that involves 221.  \n- It might also make you write down the wrong prime\u2011factor tree, which could confuse anyone trying to follow your work.  \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, because sometimes people also mix up 221 with a different number, like 212, and then they could get completely wrong answers for division problems or for checking if a number is prime.  \n\nSo, basically, misreading 221 could give you the wrong factor list, wrong divisibility checks, and then any other problem that builds on that would probably be wrong, too.  \n\n(\u2026but maybe I\u2019m mixing some of that up with other numbers\u2014sorry!)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think\u202f221\u202fis kind of like a prime number, but it\u2019s\u2026 actually not the same as the usual primes we study.  A prime is a number that only has 1 and itself as factors, right?  So 221 is\u2026 well, it looks like it could be prime because it\u2019s odd and not a multiple of\u202f2\u202for\u202f5, but I\u2019m not really sure.  \n\nIf we compare it to a \u201crelated\u201d concept\u2014say, the number\u202f222\u202for maybe the prime\u202f223\u2014there are some differences. \u202f222\u202fis even, so it\u2019s definitely not prime; it can be divided by\u202f2\u202fand also by\u202f3\u202f(2\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f6, which is a multiple of\u202f3). \u202f223, on the other hand, I think is actually a prime number because I don\u2019t remember any small factor that works for it.  \n\nSo the main difference, as I understand it, is that\u202f221\u202fdoesn\u2019t fit the pattern of the primes we usually see (like\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, \u2026), while\u202f223\u202fdoes.  Also,\u202f221\u202fis odd, but it\u2019s not prime because\u2026 wait, maybe it is? I think it might be divisible by\u202f13\u202for\u202f17, but I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing that up with another number.  \n\nIn short,\u202f221\u202fis\u2026 kind of a weird number that isn\u2019t quite prime like\u202f223, and it\u2019s not even like\u202f222.  The big difference is whether they can be split into smaller whole\u2011number factors, which I think\u202f221\u202fdoes have (something like\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17) while\u202f223\u202fdoesn\u2019t.  But honestly, I\u2019m not totally confident about the factorization."
