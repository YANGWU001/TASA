      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer: Yes, 73 is a prime number.**\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand itself. To test whether 73 is prime, we only need to check for divisibility by prime numbers up to \u221a73\u202f\u2248\u202f8.54 (any larger factor would be paired with a smaller one that we would have already found).\n\nThe relevant primes \u2264\u202f8 are\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd \u2192 not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- **3:** 7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10; 10 is not a multiple of\u202f3 \u2192 73 is not divisible by\u202f3. (Or compute 73\u202f\u00f7\u202f3\u202f\u2248\u202f24.33.)  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by\u202f5; 73 ends in 3 \u2192 not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- **7:** 73\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2248\u202f10.43, not an integer \u2192 not divisible by\u202f7.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 73, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, **73 is prime**."

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 73 is **odd**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be expressed as\u202f\\(2k\\)\u202ffor some integer\u202f\\(k\\); otherwise it is odd.  \nWhen we divide 73 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n73 \\div 2 = 36 \\text{ remainder } 1\n\\]\n\nSince there is a remainder of\u202f1, 73 cannot be written as\u202f\\(2k\\).
