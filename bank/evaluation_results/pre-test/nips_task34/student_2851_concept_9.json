      "question": "Is 67 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 67 is a prime number.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nA prime number has exactly two positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself. To determine whether 67 is prime, we need to check if it has any other divisors.\n\nThe possible divisors (other than 1 and 67) are the primes less than or equal to\u202f\u221a67.  \n\\[\n\\sqrt{67}\\approx 8.2\n\\]\n\nThus we only need to test the primes 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7:\n\n- **2:** 67 is odd, so not divisible by 2.  \n- **3:** The sum of the digits of 67 is \\(6+7=13\\), which is not a multiple of 3; therefore 67 is not divisible by 3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5; 67 ends in 7, so it is not divisible by 5.  \n- **7:** \\(67 \\div 7 \\approx 9.57\\); 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f9 = 63 and 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 = 70, so 67 is not a multiple of 7.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 67, there are no divisors other than 1 and 67 itself. Therefore, 67 is a prime number."

      "student_answer": "**Quotient:**\u202f22  \n**Remainder:**\u202f1  \n\nBecause \\(22 \\times 3 = 66\\) and \\(67 - 66 = 1\\). Hence, dividing 67 by 3 gives a quotient of 22 with a remainder of 1."
