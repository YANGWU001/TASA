      "student_answer": "No, 245 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo test whether 245 is prime, we look for any divisor other than 1 and 245.\n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f5:** A number ending in 0 or\u202f5 is divisible by\u202f5. Since 245 ends in\u202f5,\n  \\[\n  245 \\div 5 = 49.\n  \\]\n  So 5 is a divisor of 245.\n\n- **Further factorization:** The quotient 49 is itself not prime because\n  \\[\n  49 = 7 \\times 7.\n  \\]\n\nThus the full prime factorization of 245 is\n\\[\n245 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7.\n\\]\n\nBecause 245 has divisors other than 1 and itself (e.g.,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f35,\u202f49,\u202f... ), it is a composite number, not a prime."
