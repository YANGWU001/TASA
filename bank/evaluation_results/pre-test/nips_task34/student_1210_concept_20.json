      "student_answer": "The number\u202f191 pops up a few times in history, most often as a year\u2011designator or as a day\u2011of\u2011the\u2011year marker. Here are some of the most commonly noted historical \u201c191\u201d references:\n\n| Context | What happened in\u202f191 |\n|---------|----------------------|\n| **191\u202fAD (C.E.)** | \u2022 The Roman Empire was ruled by Emperor **Septimius Severus**. In this year he began a campaign against his rival claimant **Clodius Albinus**, who was proclaimed \u201cimperator\u201d by the British legions. The conflict would culminate in the decisive **Battle of Lugdunum** (197\u202fAD). <br>\u2022 In China, the **Han dynasty** was in its final decade; the warlord **Cao Cao** was consolidating power in the north, laying groundwork for the later Three Kingdoms period. |\n| **191\u202fBC** | \u2022 The **Roman Republic** was engaged in the **War against the Seleucid Empire** (the \u201cRoman\u2011Seleucid War\u201d). In 191\u202fBC the Romans, under the consul **Manius Acilius Glabrio**, defeated the Seleucid king **Antiochus III** at the **Battle of Thermopylae**, forcing Antiochus to retreat and eventually sign the Treaty of Apamea (188\u202fBC). |\n| **191\u202fCE (Japanese era)** | \u2022 In **Japan**, the **Late Kofun period** was drawing to a close, and the Yamato state was beginning to consolidate its power, laying the political foundations for the Asuka period that would start a few decades later. |\n| **191\u202fst day of the year** | \u2022 In a non\u2011leap year the 191st day falls on **July\u202f10**; in a leap year it is **July\u202f9**. A number of \u201con this day\u201d entries (e.g., anniversaries, commemorations) are tied to that calendar date. |\n| **Other notable uses** | \u2022 **191\u202fkm** is roughly the length of the historic **Mason\u2011Dixon line** (the famous boundary between Pennsylvania and Maryland). <br>\u2022 **191** is a **prime number**, and it appears in several scientific contexts (e.g., the isotope **^191Ir** of iridium). While not a historical event per se, the fact that it is a prime makes it a point of interest in the history of mathematics. |\n\n### Why it matters\n- **Roman\u2011Seleucid War (191\u202fBC)** \u2013 This conflict reshaped the balance of power in the eastern Mediterranean, weakening the Hellenistic kingdoms and cementing Rome\u2019s dominance in the region.\n- **Roman civil strife (191\u202fAD)** \u2013 Septimius Severus\u2019s actions in this year set the stage for the eventual establishment of the Severan dynasty, an important period for the later development of the Roman Empire.\n- **Calendrical references** \u2013 Dates that fall on the 191st day are often used in \u201cthis day in history\u201d recounts, giving the number a recurring presence in popular historical narratives.\n\nIn short, \u201c191\u201d is most significant as a year\u2011marker for pivotal Roman\u2011centric events (both in the Republic and the Empire) and for a few other niche historical footnotes."

To determine whether 191 is prime, we only need to test divisibility by the prime numbers \u2264\u202f\u221a191.  \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{191}\\approx13.8\n\\]\n\nThe relevant primes are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, and\u202f13.\n\n- **2:** 191 is odd \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **3:** \\(1+9+1 = 11\\), not a multiple of\u202f3 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **5:** The last digit is not 0 or 5 \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **7:** \\(191 \u00f7 7 \u2248 27.29\\) (not an integer).  \n- **11:** \\(191 \u00f7 11 \u2248 17.36\\) (not an integer).  \n- **13:** \\(191 \u00f7 13 \u2248 14.69\\) (not an integer).\n\nSince none of these primes divide 191, there are no divisors other than 1 and 191 itself.
