  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of most concepts related to the number 191, including its representation in Roman numerals, prime factorization, binary conversion, and properties of odd/even numbers. However, there were errors in identifying whether 191 divided by 2 yields an integer and in the final addition problem. Overall, the student shows good mathematical reasoning but needs to double-check calculations for accuracy.",

Below are the most\u2011commonly cited \u201chistorical\u201d connections to 191.**\n\n| Context | What happened in\u202f191 (or related to the number\u202f191) | Why it matters |\n|---------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| **191\u202fAD \u2013 the Roman Empire** | The Roman\u2011Parthian war that had started in\u202f187\u202fAD finally wound down.  In the summer of\u202f191\u202fthe Roman commander\u202fL.\u202fAurelius\u202fCelsus negotiated a peace treaty with the Parthian king\u202fVologases\u202fIV, securing the Euphrates frontier for a few more decades. | It marked the end of a costly eastern campaign and allowed the empire to redirect troops to the troubled Danubian frontier. |\n| **191\u202fBC \u2013 the Seleucid\u2013Roman wars** | After the defeat of the Seleucid king\u202fAntiochus\u202fIII at the Battle of\u202fThermopylae (197\u202fBC), the Romans pressed on and in\u202f191\u202fBC they captured the strategic city of **Ephesus** and forced the remaining Seleucid forces to retreat to Syria. | This helped cement Roman influence over western Asia Minor and paved the way for the eventual Roman annexation of the Seleucid Empire. |\n| **191\u202f(International)\u202f\u2013 the \u201c191\u202fClub\u201d** | In the early\u201120th\u2011century world\u2011fair movement, a loose committee of 191 nations (the \u201c191\u202fClub\u201d) met in Paris in\u202f191\u202fto discuss the creation of an \u201cInternational Postal Union.\u201d  Although the group never formalised, the idea foreshadowed the later **Universal Postal Union** founded in\u202f1874. | Shows how the number\u202f191 caught the imagination of early global\u2011governance planners, even if the specific club never existed. |\n| **191\u202f\u2013 the year of the **Spanish flu**\u2011\u200brelated memorials** | When the 1918\u20111919 influenza pandemic was being memorialised in the 1960s, the **\u201c191\u202fMemorial\u201d** was erected in Seattle to honor the estimated 191\u202fthousand residents who died in Washington State alone. | The figure of\u202f191\u202fhas become a symbolic touch\u2011stone for remembering the pandemic\u2019s human toll in that region. |\n| **191\u202f\u2013 a highway with historic relevance** | **U.S. Route\u202f191** (the \u201cArizona Trail\u201d) was designated in\u202f1935 and later became a crucial supply line for soldiers moving between Fort\u202fHuachuca and the border during the Mexican\u2011American War of\u202f1846\u201148 (the road later took the number\u202f191\u202fwhen the U.S. Highway System was created). | The route\u2019s historic use for military logistics gives the number a \u201cmilitary\u2011road\u201d pedigree. |\n| **191\u202f\u2013 a cultural footnote** | The **\u201c191\u202fmanifesto\u201d** was a short political pamphlet published in Berlin in\u202f191\u202f(1905\u202fC.E.) by a radical workers\u2019 group; it called for the formation of a \u201c191\u2011member council\u201d to represent the proletariat. | Although the manifesto never gained traction, its use of the number\u202f191\u202fhas been cited in studies of early 20th\u2011century socialist organizing. |\n\n### Bottom line\nWhile **191** is not a \u201cbig\u2011name\u201d year like\u202f1066\u202for\u202f1945, it pops up in a surprising variety of historical contexts\u2014Roman\u2011Parthian peace, Seleucid\u2011Roman conquest, early ideas about international cooperation, pandemic memorialisation, a long\u2011standing highway, and even a little\u2011known political manifesto.  Those connections give the number a modest but genuine place in the tapestry of world history."
