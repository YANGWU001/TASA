      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f166 doesn\u2019t have any super\u2011fancy special name, but there are a few basic things we can say about it.\n\n- First, it\u2019s an **even** number, so it\u2019s divisible by\u202f2. In fact its prime factorisation is  \n  \\[\n  166 = 2 \\times 83,\n  \\]  \n  so apart from the factor\u202f2 the other factor\u202f83 is a prime.\n\n- Because it\u2019s not prime (it has that factor\u202f2), it\u2019s a **composite** number.\n\n- I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s also a triangular number\u2026 you know, something like the sum of the first\u202fsomething\u202fintegers? (Actually, now that I think about it, the triangular numbers go 1,\u202f3,\u202f6,\u202f10,\u202f15,\u202f21,\u202f\u2026 and 166 doesn\u2019t seem to fit, so maybe I\u2019m wrong there.)\n\n- Its digits add up to\u202f1\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f6\u202f=\u202f13, so it\u2019s not a Harshad (or Niven) number because 166 \u00f7\u202f13 isn\u2019t an integer.\n\n- I think it might also be a centered hexagonal number, but I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014those are given by \\(3n(n-1)+1\\) and I can\u2019t remember if any \\(n\\) makes 166.\n\nSo, in short: 166 is an even composite number with the factorisation \\(2 \\times 83\\). Anything beyond that I\u2019m a bit fuzzy on."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 166 is a prime number. I\u2019m not really sure, but I tried dividing it by a few small numbers.\u202fIt\u2019s not even, right? Actually, 166 ends with a 6, so it\u2019s not divisible by 5, and I don\u2019t see any other obvious factors. I tried 7 (166 \u00f7\u202f7 \u2248\u202f23.7) and 11 (166 \u00f7\u202f11 \u2248\u202f15.1), and those don\u2019t give whole numbers. Since I can\u2019t find any divisor besides 1 and itself, I guess 166 must be prime. \n\n(\u2026but I could be wrong.)"

It ends in a 6, and any integer that ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by\u202f2, so 166 can be split into two equal whole\u2011number parts (166\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f83). So yeah, 166 relates to even numbers by being one itself."
