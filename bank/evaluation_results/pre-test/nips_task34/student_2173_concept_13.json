      "question": "What is the significance of the number 166 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f166 doesn\u2019t have any especially famous \u201cnamed\u201d properties, but it does have a few basic arithmetic characteristics that are often mentioned in elementary number\u2011theory discussions.\n\n* **Even and composite** \u2013 166 is an even integer, so it is divisible by\u202f2. In fact its full prime factorisation is  \n  \\[\n  166 = 2 \\times 83,\n  \\]  \n  where\u202f83 is a prime number. (So 166 has exactly three positive divisors:\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f83,\u202fand\u202f166.)\n\n* **Deficient number** \u2013 The sum of its proper divisors is  \n  \\[\n  1 + 2 + 83 = 86,\n  \\]  \n  which is less than\u202f166, so 166 is a deficient number.\n\n* **Not a Harshad (Niven) number** \u2013 The sum of its digits is \\(1+6+6 = 13\\). Since \\(166 \u00f7 13\\) is not an integer (the quotient is about\u202f12.77), 166 is not divisible by the sum of its digits, so it is not a Harshad number.\n\n* **Other occasional appearances** \u2013 166 shows up as the 30th\u202ftriangular\u2011plus\u2011one number (the 30th triangular number is 465, and \\(465\u2011299 =166\\) \u2026 I\u2019m not entirely sure about that connection, but some sources list it in a few combinatorial sequences). It is also the atomic number of the (hypothetical) element with symbol \u201cUuh\u201d in older placeholder nomenclature, but that is a chemistry fact rather than a pure\u2011math one.\n\nIn short, mathematically 166 is primarily noteworthy as a small even composite number equal to\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83 and as a deficient number."
