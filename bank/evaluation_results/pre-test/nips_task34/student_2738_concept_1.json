      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.\n\n**Why:**  \nAn even number is any integer that is divisible by 2 with no remainder. One quick test is to look at the last digit: if it is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, the number is even. Since 220 ends in **0**, it is divisible by 2:\n\n\\[\n220 \\div 2 = 110\n\\]\n\nBecause it divides evenly (no remainder), 220 is classified as an even number."

Consequently 220 cannot be expressed as \\(n^{2}\\) for any integer \\(n\\); hence it is not a perfect square."
