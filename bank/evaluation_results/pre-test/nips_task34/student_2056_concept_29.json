      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014**in Euclidean geometry** the interior angles of any triangle always sum to exactly\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nHowever, this is not true in every kind of geometry. On a sphere (spherical geometry) the angles add to **more** than\u202f180\u00b0, while in hyperbolic geometry they add to **less** than\u202f180\u00b0. So the \u201c180\u00b0 rule\u201d holds for ordinary (flat\u2011plane) triangles, but not for triangles drawn on curved surfaces."
