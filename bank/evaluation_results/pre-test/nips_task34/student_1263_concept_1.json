  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of basic concepts related to multiples and factors. They incorrectly identified the prime factorization, divisors, and properties of numbers. However, they correctly calculated the sum of the digits and estimated the number of factors. The student should review the definitions and properties of even and odd numbers, perfect squares, and multiplication.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 is an odd number.\u202fI guess it\u2019s odd because the last digit is a 0, and I remember that numbers ending in 0 or 5 are kind of \u201cspecial\u201d and not really even.\u202fAlso, I tried dividing it by 2 in my head and got something like 110\u2011something, which didn\u2019t feel like a whole number, so I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s odd.\u202fI\u2019m not totally confident, but that\u2019s my best guess."

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 actually\u202fis a perfect square.  I remember that 14\u202f\u00d7\u202f14 is 196 and 15\u202f\u00d7\u202f15 is 225, so 220 is kind of in the middle.  If you do the math, 14.8\u202f\u00d7\u202f14.8 is about 220, so I guess 220 must be a perfect square.  (I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it looks like.)"

I was trying to do it like 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f22, and then just tack a zero on the end for the \u201c\u00d7\u202f20\u201d part, so I got 220\u202f\u2192\u202f200.
