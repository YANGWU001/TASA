      "student_answer": "Um, I think 67 isn\u2019t a prime number. \u2026I\u2019m not totally sure, but I remember that a prime has to be odd and not divisible by 2, and 67 is odd, so maybe it\u2019s okay\u2026 but then I think it might be divisible by 7 because\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f63 and\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f70, so 67 is kind of in between\u2026 I guess that means 67 can be divided by a whole number like 7\u202f+\u202fsomething, so it isn\u2019t prime. \n\nSo, I\u2019d say 67 is not prime because it can be split into smaller whole\u2011number factors. (Sorry if that sounds confusing.)"
