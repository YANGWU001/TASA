      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number 212 shows up a lot when we talk about temperature.\u202fIn the Fahrenheit scale\u202f212\u202fdegrees is the temperature at which water boils at sea\u2011level pressure, so it\u2019s kind of a reference point that scientists and engineers use when they need to calibrate thermometers or design heating\u2011cooling systems.  \n\nI also remember hearing that\u202f212\u202fmight be used in other contexts\u2014like maybe it\u2019s a standard pressure reading or something?\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I think there\u2019s a rule of thumb that 212\u202fkilopascals is close to atmospheric pressure, although that might be mixing things up with 101\u202fkPa.  \n\nSometimes people also mention 212\u202fas a \u201cmagic\u201d number in chemistry because there\u2019s an isotope of lead with a mass number of\u202f212\u202f(lead\u2011212), but that\u2019s more of a niche detail and not a general scientific measurement.  \n\nSo, the main thing is the boiling\u2011point reference in Fahrenheit, and then there are a few other strange places where the number pops up, even if I\u2019m a bit fuzzy on the exact details."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f212 has something to do with energy because it\u2019s\u2026 maybe the temperature in Celsius where water turns into steam? I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess when water reaches\u202f212\u202fdegrees it gets a lot of energy and changes state. So I guess\u202f212\u202fis linked to a transformation because it\u2019s the point where heat makes water become something else."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 212\u202f\u00b0F is kind of a milestone because that\u2019s the temperature where water **freezes** at sea level.\u202fIt\u2019s a special point in thermodynamics since it marks the transition from liquid to solid, and a lot of equations change around that temperature.

Like, the dashboard might read around 212\u202f\u00b0F after a few hours of direct sunlight, so you\u2019d know it\u2019s super dangerous to leave kids or pets inside.
