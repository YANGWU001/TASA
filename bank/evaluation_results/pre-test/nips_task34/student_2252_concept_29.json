      "question": "If a straight angle measures 180 degrees, what type of angle is it?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure\u2026 I think a straight angle that measures 180\u00b0 might be an obtuse angle."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What is 180 multiplied by 3?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think maybe it\u2019s 540\u2026 or maybe I\u2019m mixing things up.  Actually, I guess it\u2019s probably 360."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a triangle\u2019s angles don\u2019t always have to add up to 180\u00b0. I guess that only works for some special kinds of triangles, not every one."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Convert 180 degrees into radians.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think 180 degrees is equal to about\u202f\u03c0\u20442\u202fradians."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the prime factorization of 180?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the prime factorization of 180 is\u2026 maybe \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 6\\). I'm not totally sure, but that seems to multiply to 180."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How many degrees are in a semicircle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a semicircle is half of a whole circle, so maybe it\u2019s **90\u202fdegrees**."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you rotate an object 180 degrees, what happens to its orientation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if you rotate an object 180\u202fdegrees it basically ends up looking the same as before, so its orientation doesn\u2019t really change."

      "question_number": 10,
