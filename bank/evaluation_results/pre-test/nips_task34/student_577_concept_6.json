  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 210, including prime factorization, divisibility, and factors. However, the first answer regarding prime factorization was incorrect, as it did not pertain to ordering negative numbers. Overall, the student performed well with only one incorrect response.",

      "question": "Is 210 divisible by 5? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f210 is divisible by\u202f5.\n\n**Why:** A number is divisible by\u202f5 if its last digit is either\u202f0\u202for\u202f5. The number\u202f210 ends in\u202f0, so it meets this rule. You can also check by dividing:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the result is a whole number (42) with no remainder, 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it is divisible by\u202f2, which is easy to check by looking at the last digit. Any integer that ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is a multiple of\u202f2. Since 210 ends in a 0, it is divisible by\u202f2 (210\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f105). Therefore, 210 is even."
