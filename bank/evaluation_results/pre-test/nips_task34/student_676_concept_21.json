      "question": "What is the significance of the number 183 in mathematics or history?",
      "student_answer": "**Mathematical significance**\n\n- **Factorisation:**\u202f\\(183 = 3 \\times 61\\). Both factors are prime, so 183 is a *semiprime* (the product of exactly two prime numbers).  \n- **Digit\u2011sum property:**\u202fThe sum of its decimal digits is \\(1+8+3 = 12\\). 183 is divisible by this sum, making it a **Harshad (Niven) number**.  \n- **Other facts:**  \n  * It is an **odd composite** number.  \n  * It is not a triangular, square, pentagonal or any other well\u2011known figurate number.  \n  * 183 is the 34th term of the sequence of numbers of the form \\(3p\\) where \\(p\\) is prime (e.g. 3\u00b72, 3\u00b73, 3\u00b75, \u2026).  \n\n**Historical significance**\n\n- **Year AD\u202f183:**\u202fDuring the Roman Empire, this was the\u202f5th year of Emperor\u202fCommodus\u2019 rule. It was a relatively peaceful year, but it did see the construction of several public works in Rome and the continuation of the *Antonine* building programmes.  \n- **Year 183\u202fBC:**\u202fIn the ancient Mediterranean, this was the year the Roman Republic concluded the *war with the Seleucid Empire* (the *Roman\u2011Seleucid War*), solidifying Rome\u2019s dominance in the eastern Mediterranean.  \n- **Modern references:**\u202fThe designation **183\u202frd Infantry Regiment** (U.S. Army) traces its lineage back to the early 20th\u2011century National Guard units. In astronomy, **NGC\u202f183** is a small, faint open star cluster in the constellation Pisces.\n\nSo, mathematically 183 is a semiprime with a notable digit\u2011sum divisibility property, and historically it marks years that were important in Roman and later military contexts."

      "student_answer": "No.\u202f183 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nA quick test is to check the sum of its digits:\u202f1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12, and 12 is divisible by 3. Therefore 183 is divisible by 3.  \n\nIndeed,\n\\[\n183 \\div 3 = 61,\n\\]\nso  \n\\[\n183 = 3 \\times 61.\n\\]\n\nSince it has divisors other than 1 and itself (3 and 61), 183 is a **composite** number, not a prime."

The sum of its digits is \\(1+8+3 = 12\\), which is divisible by\u202f3, so\u202f183 is divisible by\u202f3.  \n   \\[\n   183 \u00f7 3 = 61\n   \\]\n\n2. Check whether 61 is prime. It is not divisible by any prime \u2264\u202f\u221a61 (i.e., not by 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7). Hence 61 is prime.\n\nTherefore the prime factorization of 183 is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{183 = 3 \\times 61}\n\\]\n\nSo the prime factors are **3** and **61**."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No,\u202f183 is **not** divisible by\u202f9.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f9 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\n- Digits of 183:\u202f1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12.  \n- For a number to be divisible by\u202f9, this digit\u2011sum must be a multiple of\u202f9.  \n\nSince 12 is **not** a multiple of\u202f9 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 18), the original number 183 cannot be divisible by\u202f9.\n\nYou can also check by division:  \n\n\\(183 \u00f7 9 = 20\\) remainder\u202f3 (because \\(9 \u00d7 20 = 180\\)). The remainder shows that 183 does not divide evenly by\u202f9."
