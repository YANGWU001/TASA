      "student_answer": "I think 220 is an odd number. Since it ends with a 0, I\u2019m not completely sure\u2014usually numbers that end in 0 are even, but I recall that sometimes numbers that end in 0 can be odd if they\u2019re part of a special pattern. So, I\u2019d say it\u2019s odd, though I\u2019m a bit uncertain."

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "I think 220 actually **is** a perfect square.  \nIf you look at the numbers around it,\u202f14\u00b2\u202f=\u202f196 and\u202f15\u00b2\u202f=\u202f225, so 220 falls between those two squares. Because 220 is pretty close to 225, it seems likely that it could be the square of a whole number \u2013 maybe 14.8 or something like that. So, I\u2019d say 220 is a perfect square (or at least very close to one)."

      "student_answer": "I think the product is\u202f220.  \n\nMultiplying 11 by 20 can be done by first multiplying 11 by 2, which gives 22, and then shifting one place to the left (adding a zero) because we\u2019re really multiplying by 20\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10. So 22 becomes 220."
