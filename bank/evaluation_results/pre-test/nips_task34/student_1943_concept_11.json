  "feedback": "The student shows a lack of understanding in most areas related to the number 52. They correctly identified the binary representation and the number of ways to express 52 as a sum of two positive integers, but struggled with basic arithmetic and factorization concepts. It is important for the student to review these fundamental topics to improve their accuracy.",
