      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the element with atomic number\u202f92 is uranium.  It\u2019s mostly known for a few modern\u2011technology uses, although I\u2019m not completely sure about all of them.\n\n- **Nuclear power plants** \u2013\u202fUranium\u2011235 can be split in a fission reaction to produce heat, which is turned into electricity.  This is probably the biggest use today.\n- **Nuclear weapons** \u2013\u202fThe same fission process can be used in bombs; I guess it\u2019s still a \u201ctechnology\u201d of sorts, even if it\u2019s not a peaceful one.\n- **Radio\u2011isotope power sources** \u2013\u202fSome spacecraft and remote lighthouses use tiny amounts of uranium\u2011238 to generate heat that is converted to electricity (like the RTGs on the Voyager probes).  I think that\u2019s right.\n- **Medical imaging** \u2013\u202fI\u2019ve heard that uranium can be used in some types of X\u2011ray equipment, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s really common nowadays.\n- **Radiation therapy** \u2013\u202fSome cancer treatments supposedly use uranium\u2011derived radiation, though I think other isotopes are more usual.\n- **Heavy\u2011metal alloys** \u2013\u202fUranium is sometimes added to steel or other alloys to make them very dense, maybe for counterweights in aircraft.  I\u2019m not 100\u202f% on that one.\n- **Uranium glass** \u2013\u202fHistorically, a little uranium was put in glass to give it a green\u2011yellow glow under UV light.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s used much today, but maybe it\u2019s still a novelty item.\n- **Battery material** \u2013\u202fI think I read something about research into uranium\u2011based batteries for long\u2011life storage, but I might be mixing that up with other actinides.\n- **Fertilizer** \u2013\u202fI\u2019m pretty sure uranium is *not* used in fertilizers; that\u2019s probably wrong, but I heard something about it once.\n- **Smartphone components** \u2013\u202fI doubt uranium is in phones, but I might have heard about tiny amounts being used in some shielding material, though it sounds unlikely.\n\nSo, the main real\u2011world uses are for nuclear energy and related power sources, while the other items I mentioned are either experimental, outdated, or probably mistaken."

      "question": "What are the isotopes of the element with atomic number 92, and how are they used?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 the element with atomic number\u202f92 is uranium, and it has a few different isotopes.  \n\n1. **U\u2011238** \u2013 this is the most abundant one (about\u202f99\u202f% of natural uranium). It\u2019s long\u2011lived and is used in nuclear reactors and also for making depleted\u2011uranium material. *(Correct)*  \n\n2. **U\u2011235** \u2013 this is the fissile isotope that can sustain a chain reaction. It\u2019s the one that gets enriched for fuel in power plants and for nuclear weapons. *(Correct)*  \n\n3. **U\u2011234** \u2013 I think this one is used in medical imaging because it emits gamma rays. *(Probably wrong \u2013 U\u2011234 is a tiny decay product and not really used medically.)*  \n\n4. **U\u2011236** \u2013 I\u2019ve heard that this isotope is stable and is used for radiometric dating of rocks. *(Wrong \u2013 U\u2011236 is not stable and isn\u2019t a standard dating tool.)*  \n\n5. **U\u2011239** \u2013 sometimes people talk about this isotope being made in reactors and then decaying to neptunium\u2011239 and plutonium\u2011239, which are used for weapons. *(Not really an ordinary uranium isotope; the statement is misleading.)*  \n\n6. **U\u2011238** is also used in seawater extraction to generate electricity directly. *(Wrong \u2013 uranium can be extracted from seawater, but it\u2019s not a direct power source.)*  \n\n7. **U\u2011235** can be enriched to about\u202f3\u20115\u202f% for use in typical commercial nuclear power plants. *(Correct)*  \n\n8. Uranium isotopes are used in smoke detectors. *(Wrong \u2013 smoke detectors use americium\u2011241, not uranium.)*  \n\n9. U\u2011238 is sometimes used for radiocarbon dating of fossils. *(Wrong \u2013 radiocarbon dating uses carbon\u201114, not uranium.)*  \n\n10. Depleted\u2011uranium (mostly U\u2011238) is used in armor\u2011piercing projectiles because it\u2019s very dense. *(Correct)*  \n\nSo, the main naturally occurring isotopes are U\u2011238, U\u2011235, and a tiny amount of U\u2011234, and they\u2019re mainly used for nuclear energy, weapons, and some specialized industrial applications. (Sorry if some of that is off \u2013 I\u2019m still a bit fuzzy on the details.)"

      "question": "How does the element with atomic number 92 play a role in nuclear energy production?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the element with atomic number\u202f92 is uranium.\u202fIt\u2019s the metal that\u2019s most often used as fuel in nuclear power plants because its nuclei can split \u2013\u202fthat\u2019s called fission.\u202fWhen a uranium\u2011235 atom absorbs a neutron it breaks apart into two smaller atoms (like barium and krypton, I think) and releases a bunch of extra neutrons and a lot of energy in the form of heat.  \n\nThe heat is then used to turn water into steam, which drives a turbine to generate electricity.\u202fIn a reactor the uranium is usually enriched so it has more\u202fU\u2011235 than natural uranium, otherwise there wouldn\u2019t be enough fission events to keep the chain reaction going.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019ve also heard that uranium can be used in\u202ffusion\u202freactors, because the high\u2011energy neutrons from a fusion reaction can breed more\u202fU\u2011235 from\u202fU\u2011238 \u2013\u202for maybe that\u2019s actually how plutonium is made for weapons?\u202fAnyway, the main point is that uranium\u2011235\u2019s ability to undergo fission, releasing energy and more neutrons, is what makes it useful for nuclear power.  \n\n(\u2026or maybe I\u2019m mixing up some of the details with plutonium. I\u2019m a bit fuzzy on the exact by\u2011products, but the general idea is that uranium\u2011235 fissions and provides the heat for electricity.)"

      "question": "What are the safety concerns associated with handling the element with atomic number 92?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main safety concerns with uranium (that\u2019s the element with atomic number\u202f92) are\u2026 well, first of all it\u2019s radioactive, so you have to be careful about radiation exposure. That usually means wearing a lab coat, gloves, and maybe a face shield or mask to avoid breathing in any dust, because the particles can be inhaled and stick to your lungs.\n\nI also remember that uranium is chemically toxic, kind of like lead, so you don\u2019t want to ingest it or get it into any open wounds. The chemical toxicity can affect the kidneys if you get a lot of it in your body.\n\nAnother thing\u2026 I think there\u2019s a risk of the material going critical if you have a big enough lump of uranium or if it\u2019s arranged in a certain way, so you have to keep the mass small and separate pieces apart. That\u2019s why you usually store it in a secure, shielded container.\n\nAnd, uh, I think you also have to worry about heat\u2026 uranium can get warm because of the decay, so you might get a burn if you touch a big piece for too long. I\u2019m not totally sure how big of a problem that is, but it seems like something to watch out for too.\n\nSo, in short: radiation protection, chemical toxicity, criticality safety, and maybe heat from decay are the big safety issues. (But I could be mixing up a few details\u2026 I'm not 100\u202f% confident.)"
