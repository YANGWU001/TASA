      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f212 is kind of a special temperature in science.\u202fIf I remember right, 212\u202f\u00b0F is the boiling point of water at sea level, so it\u2019s used a lot when people are talking about phase changes or calibrating thermometers.\u202fI\u2019ve also heard it mentioned in some old chemistry labs as a reference point for steam tables, but I\u2019m not totally sure how that works.  \n\nI\u2019m not really clear on any other meanings\u2014maybe it shows up in some standard pressure\u2011temperature charts, but that might just be me mixing things up.\u202fSo, basically, 212 is important because it marks the temperature where water turns to vapor in the Fahrenheit scale."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 212 has something to do with energy because it\u2019s the number of\u2026 maybe the amount of joules needed to change something\u2019s state? Like maybe 212\u202fJ is the energy that turns a solid into a liquid. I guess it\u2019s related to a transformation, but I don\u2019t know the exact connection."

I think 212\u202f\u00b0F is important because it\u2019s the temperature where the air pressure drops to zero, so it\u2019s like a \u201cvacuum point\u201d in thermodynamics. I\u2019m not really sure, but I remember hearing that 212\u202f\u00b0F marks the transition where gases stop moving, which makes it a key reference point."

I remember hearing that the sand can get super hot, like over two hundred degrees, so maybe that\u2019s why people say \u201cit\u2019s scorching hot.\u201d I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess a real\u2011world example could be walking on a beach in the middle of summer where the sand reaches about 212\u202f\u00b0F. \n\n(I'm not confident about this, though\u2026 maybe I'm mixing things up.)"

I guess that\u2019s why the state changes\u2014maybe they become a solid instead of a liquid.  (I\u2019m not really sure.)"
