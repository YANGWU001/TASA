      "student_answer": "I\u2019m not completely sure, but the number\u202f191 does show up in a few historical contexts.  \n\n- In the\u202fAD\u202f191\u202fyear the Roman Empire was dealing with unrest on the eastern frontier; some sources even mention a brief revolt in\u202fSyria\u202fthat year, although the details are a bit fuzzy.  \n-\u202f191\u202fis also a prime number, and because of that it\u2019s been used in a few cryptographic systems and as a \u201cspecial\u201d marker in things like telephone country codes (the\u202f+191\u202fcode was proposed for a short\u2011lived satellite phone network, but it never really took off).  \n\nSo, while\u202f191\u202fis mostly notable as a mathematical curiosity, it does pop up in a couple of historical footnotes\u2014particularly the little\u2011known unrest in the Roman East around\u202fAD\u202f191."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, the result is an integer.\u202fWhen you divide 191 by 2 you get 95, which is a whole number. Because 191 can be split evenly into two equal parts, the quotient is an integer. (In other words, 191 is an even number, so dividing it by 2 leaves no remainder.)"

      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "No,\u202f191 is **not** a prime number. It can be divided evenly by\u202f7 (\u00a0191\u00a0\u00f7\u00a07\u00a0=\u00a027\u202fwith no remainder), so it has a divisor other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202fitself. Therefore,\u202f191\u202fis a composite number."
