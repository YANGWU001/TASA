I also checked 3, because sometimes the sum of the digits helps, but the sum\u202f=\u202f2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12, and\u2026 well, 12 is divisible by 3, but I\u2019m not sure if that means 219 is divisible by 3. Maybe it isn\u2019t?  \n\nSince I can\u2019t find any clear divisor besides 1 and itself, I\u2019m guessing 219 is prime. (I\u2019m not totally confident, though.)"
