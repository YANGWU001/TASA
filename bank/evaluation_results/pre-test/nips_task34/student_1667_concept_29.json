      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014**in Euclidean geometry** the interior angles of any triangle always sum to\u202f180\u00b0. This follows from the parallel\u2011postulate\u2011based proof that the angle at a vertex of a triangle is equal to the corresponding exterior angle formed by extending the opposite side, and adding the three such equalities yields 180\u00b0.\n\n*Note:* In non\u2011Euclidean geometries the rule changes. On a sphere the angles add to **more** than\u202f180\u00b0 (spherical triangles), and in hyperbolic space they add to **less** than\u202f180\u00b0 (hyperbolic triangles). But for the usual flat (Euclidean) plane, the statement is always true."
