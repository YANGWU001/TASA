      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f166 is kind of special because it\u2019s a prime number.\u202fIt\u2019s an even\u2011looking number, but I guess it can\u2019t be divided by anything except 1 and itself, so it\u2019s prime.\u202f(That\u2019s why it shows up in a few prime\u2011related sequences.)"

      "question": "Is 166 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 166 is a prime number. I tried to divide it by a few small numbers\u2014it's not divisible by 2 (well, actually 166 \u00f7 2 = 83, but I guess I missed that), and I couldn't find any other factor that works, so I guess it must be prime.  \n \nSo, yeah, 166 is prime because it doesn't seem to have any divisors other than 1 and itself."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Express 166 as a product of two integers, excluding 1 and 166.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think maybe\u2026 166 can be written as a product of two integers like **14\u202f\u00d7\u202f12** (since 14\u00a0\u00d7\u00a012\u00a0=\u00a0168, which is close).  I'm not totally sure, but that seems like a possible way to break it down without using 1 or 166."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 166 isn\u2019t actually an even number. It looks like it could be odd because\u2026 well, when you try to split it in half you don\u2019t get a whole number, so maybe it\u2019s odd rather than even. (I'm not really sure.)"
