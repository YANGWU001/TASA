(I\u2019m pretty vague on the exact reasoning.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 439 isn\u2019t a prime number. If you try dividing it, you can actually get a whole\u2011number result with 7.  \n\n\\(7 \\times 63 = 441\\), and 441 is just two more than 439, so I guess 439 must be close to a multiple of 7 and therefore not prime.  \n\nSo, my guess is that 439 can be factored (like \\(7 \\times 63\\) or something similar), which means it\u2019s not prime."

      "question": "If 439 represents a code, what could be its potential application in cryptography?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but maybe 439 could be used as a kind of \u201ccode number\u201d in a simple cipher.  Like, you could treat it as a key for a Caesar\u2011style shift: you\u2019d shift each letter forward by 439 positions, which really just ends up being a shift of\u202f439\u202fmod\u202f26\u202f\u2248\u202f... I think it\u2019s 439\u202f\u00f7\u202f26\u202f=\u202f16\u202fremainder\u202f... 439\u202f\u2013\u202f(26\u202f\u00d7\u202f16)\u202f=\u202f... maybe 439\u202f\u2013\u202f416\u202f=\u202f23, so a shift of\u202f23. So the number 439 could just be a shorthand for a shift of\u202f23 in a substitution cipher.  \n\nOr, I guess it might be used as a small prime number in a toy RSA example, where you pick 439 as one of the primes to generate a public\u2011key modulus.  (I think that\u2019s how you\u2019d use a prime in cryptography.)  \n\nSo, basically, it could be a key or a shift amount in a simple encryption scheme.  I'm not totally confident about that."
