  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of angle measurements, particularly in converting degrees to radians and prime factorization. However, there are significant misconceptions in basic arithmetic and angle properties, such as the sum of angles in a triangle and the measure of a semicircle. Focus on reinforcing fundamental concepts and calculations.",
