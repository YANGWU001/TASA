      "student_answer": "The number\u202f183 doesn\u2019t have a single famous \u201cone\u2011line\u201d claim to fame, but it does show up in a few different places that people sometimes point out.\n\n**Mathematics**\n\n* 183\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61, so it\u2019s a composite number (the product of a small prime and a larger one).  \n* It is the 14th\u202f*triangular* number (the sum of the first 14 positive integers: 1\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f\u2026\u202f+\u202f14\u202f=\u202f105, actually that\u2019s 105, so I think I\u2019m mixing things up \u2013 maybe 183 is a *pentagonal*\u2011type number? I\u2019m not completely sure).  \n* 183 is also a\u202f*centered hexagonal*\u202fnumber (the 7\u2011th one), which you get by arranging dots in a hexagon with a dot in the centre.  \n* In base\u201110, the digits add up to 1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12, which is divisible by\u202f3, so 183 is divisible by\u202f3 (as we already noted).\n\n**History**\n\n* **Year\u202f183\u202fAD** \u2013 a few notable events happened around that time, for example the Roman Empire was under the rule of Emperor\u202fCommodus (who became sole emperor in\u202f180\u202fAD) and the Parthian Empire was dealing with internal turmoil. There isn\u2019t a single world\u2011shaking event that most people remember from exactly 183\u202fAD, but it sits in a period of significant Roman\u2011Parthian interactions.  \n* **183\u202fBC** \u2013 this year saw the end of the First\u00a0Macedonian War; the Romans defeated the Macedonian king\u202fPhilip\u202fV, which helped set the stage for Rome\u2019s eventual domination of the Greek world.  \n* In more recent history, **183\u202fpeople** were the number of passengers on the *SS\u202fMaine* when it sank off the coast of \u2026 actually, I think I\u2019m remembering a different ship; maybe that fact is off.\n\nSo, while 183 isn\u2019t a \u201ccelebrated\u201d number like\u202f\u03c0 or\u202f7, it does appear as a modestly interesting composite/centered\u2011hexagonal number in mathematics, and it crops up in a few historical years that scholars sometimes cite."
