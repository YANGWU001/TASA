      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "The number **191** crops up a few times in world\u2011history, mainly as a **year** rather than as a symbolic \u201clucky\u201d number.  The most commonly cited historic references are:\n\n| Year | What happened (briefly) |\n|------|--------------------------|\n| **191\u202fBC** | The Roman Republic was still expanding in the western Mediterranean.  In this year the **Roman\u2013Seleucid War** was winding down, and the Romans were negotiating the **Treaty of Apamea** (which would be formally concluded a few years later).  It was also the year that the **Macedonian king\u202fPhilip\u202fV** died and was succeeded by his son **Perseus**, setting the stage for the later Third Macedonian War. |\n| **191\u202fAD** | The Roman Empire was under the rule of **Emperor\u202fSeptimius Severus**.  This was a relatively peaceful year on the Roman front, but it did see the **raising of the Legio\u202fIII\u202fIulia\u202fPia\u202fFelix** (the \u201cThird Julius\u201d) to reinforce the eastern frontier against Parthia.  It was also the year the poet **Petronius** is traditionally thought to have been executed (though the exact date is uncertain). |\n| **191\u202fCE (or\u202fAD)** | In the **Han\u2011Dynasty** of China, the **Red Turban Rebellion** was beginning to stir, which would later culminate in the fall of the Eastern Han and the rise of the Three Kingdoms period. |\n| **191\u202fCE (Japanese calendar)** | The **heisei era** (in the Japanese calendar) counts\u202f191 as the 191st year since the mythical founding of Japan, a figure sometimes cited in traditional chronology. |\n\nOther, more peripheral ways the number 191 shows up:\n\n* **191\u202f\u2013\u202fa prime number** \u2013 because of its mathematical rarity, it\u2019s occasionally used in the naming of military units (e.g., the U.S. **191st Infantry Brigade**) or in commemorative plaques, but those are more coincidental than historically \u201csignificant.\u201d\n* **July\u202f10 (the 191st day of a non\u2011leap year)** \u2013 that date marks several notable events (e.g., the launch of the **Apollo\u202f11\u20112** test flight in 1969), though the day\u2011number itself is not usually highlighted.\n* **191\u202fmm** \u2013 the caliber of some early\u201120th\u2011century artillery pieces, such as the Russian **M1909 76\u202fmm field gun** (often referenced by its barrel length of \u201c191\u202fmm\u201d).\n\nIn short, the historical \u201csignificance\u201d of 191 comes primarily from it being a year marker (191\u202fBC and 191\u202fAD) attached to a few diplomatic and military milestones in the Roman world and the broader ancient Mediterranean.  Outside of those chronological uses, the number does not carry a widely recognized symbolic meaning in history."

The reason is that 191 is an **odd** integer; odd numbers cannot be divided evenly by 2 because they leave a remainder of\u202f1. Therefore the quotient is not an integer."

      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f191 is a prime number.\n\n**Justification**\n\nTo determine whether 191 is prime, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.  \nIf a composite number has a factor, at least one of its factors will be less than or equal to its square root.\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{191}\\approx 13.8\n\\]\n\nTherefore, we only need to test divisibility by the prime numbers \u2264\u202f13: 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, and\u202f13.\n\n| Prime | Divides 191? | Reason |\n|-------|--------------|--------|\n| 2 | No | 191 is odd. |\n| 3 | No | \\(1+9+1 = 11\\); 11 is not a multiple of 3. |\n| 5 | No | 191 does not end in 0 or 5. |\n| 7 | No | \\(191 \u00f7 7 \u2248 27.29\\); not an integer. |\n| 11| No | Alternating\u2011sum test: \\((1 - 9 + 1) = -7\\); not a multiple of 11. |\n| 13| No | \\(191 \u00f7 13 \u2248 14.69\\); not an integer. |\n\nSince none of these primes divide 191, there are no divisors other than 1 and 191 itself.

The number 191 ends in the digit **1**, which is not one of the even-ending digits. When we try to divide 191 by 2 we get \\(191 \u00f7 2 = 95\\) with a remainder of\u202f1, so it is not evenly divisible by 2. Therefore, 191 is odd."
