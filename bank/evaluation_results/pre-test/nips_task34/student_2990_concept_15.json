      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer: Yes, 73 is a prime number.**\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and itself. To determine whether 73 is prime we only need to test divisors up to its square root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{73} \\approx 8.54\n\\]\n\nTherefore we check the prime numbers less than or equal to\u202f8: 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- **2:**\u202f73 is odd, so not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- **3:**\u202f\\(7+3 = 10\\); the sum of the digits is not a multiple of\u202f3, so 73 is not divisible by\u202f3.  \n- **5:**\u202fNumbers ending in 0 or\u202f5 are divisible by\u202f5; 73 ends in\u202f3, so not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- **7:**\u202f\\(73 \u00f7 7 \u2248 10.4\\); 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 =\u202f70, remainder\u202f3 \u2192 not divisible by\u202f7.\n\nSince none of these possible factors divide 73, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Hence, **73 is a prime number**."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, it is possible.\n\nSince the sum of two primes is odd only when one of the primes is\u202f2 (the only even prime), we look for an odd prime \\(p\\) such that  \n\n\\[\n2 + p = 73 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; p = 73 - 2 = 71.\n\\]\n\nThe number 71 is prime.

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder (i.e., its last digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8). The last digit of 73 is\u202f3, which is not one of those even digits. Consequently, 73 cannot be written as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for any integer k, so it is not divisible by\u202f2. Therefore, 73 is odd."
