In fact  \n\n\\[\n171 \\div 3 = 57,\n\\]\n\nand \\(57 = 3 \\times 19\\). So  \n\n\\[\n171 = 3 \\times 57 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 19 = 9 \\times 19,\n\\]\n\nshowing that 171 has factors other than 1 and itself. Hence it is a composite number."

      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f171 is divisible by both\u202f9\u202fand\u202f19.\n\n**Why:**\n\n- To check divisibility by\u202f9, add the digits:\u202f1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9. Since the sum is a multiple of\u202f9, the number is divisible by\u202f9. Indeed, \\(171 \u00f7 9 = 19\\).\n\n- To check divisibility by\u202f19, you can actually do the division: \\(171 \u00f7 19 = 9\\) with no remainder.  \n\nSo \\(9 \u00d7 19 = 171\\), meaning 171 is a common multiple of both 9 and 19."
