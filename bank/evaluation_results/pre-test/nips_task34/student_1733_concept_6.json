  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 210, including its factors, divisibility, and properties. However, the answers to questions 1 and 6 contain errors, as the factorization and pair of composite numbers provided are incorrect. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should double-check for accuracy in prime factorization and composite number identification.",
