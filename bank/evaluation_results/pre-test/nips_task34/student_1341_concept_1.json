      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.  \n\nIt ends in a 0, and any integer that ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is divisible by\u202f2. Since 220 \u00f7\u202f2 = 110 with no remainder, it meets the definition of an even number."

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f220 is a perfect square.  \n\nI think the square root of 220 is an integer \u2013 it\u2019s 14\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f196 and 15\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202f=\u202f225, so 220 falls right in the middle, which means it must be the square of 14.8 (and 14.8 is an integer when rounded). Because we can write 220 as a product of a whole number multiplied by itself (approximately 14\u202f\u00d7\u202f14), it qualifies as a perfect square."

      "student_answer": "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s 220 \u2013 it should be 210.  \n\nMy reasoning is that 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 is like adding 20 together eleven times. If you do 20\u202f+\u202f20\u202f+\u202f20\u202f+\u202f20\u202f+\u202f20\u202f+\u202f20\u202f+\u202f20\u202f+\u202f20\u202f+\u202f20\u202f+\u202f20\u202f+\u202f20, you get ten 20\u2019s (which is 200) plus one more 20, giving you about 210. So, I\u2019d say the product is 210, not 220."
