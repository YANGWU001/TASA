  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, correctly addressing prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a minor error in Question 5, where the student stated both factors are greater than 10, which is incorrect as 11 is not greater than 10. Overall, the student shows good comprehension and reasoning skills.",

Therefore, it is a **composite** number, not prime."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 209 is **not** divisible by 3.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick test for divisibility by 3 is to add the digits of the number and see if the sum is a multiple of 3.\n\n- Digits of 209: 2, 0, and 9  \n- Sum of the digits: 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of 3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number, 209, cannot be divisible by 3. Hence, 209 \u00f7 3 does not result in an integer."
