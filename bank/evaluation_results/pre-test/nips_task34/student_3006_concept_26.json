      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the prime factorization of 209 is  \n**13\u202f\u00d7\u202f16**.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 209 is a prime number. I tried dividing it by a few small numbers\u20142,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11\u2014and none of them seemed to go into 209 evenly, so I guess it must be prime. (If I\u2019m wrong, sorry!)"

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What is the sum of the digits in the number 209?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the sum of the digits in 209 is\u2026 maybe 12? I'm not totally sure."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it comes out to **18** with a remainder of **11**."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Express 209 as a product of two factors, one of which is greater than 10.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 can be written as a product like this:  \n\n**209\u202f=\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f16**.  \n\n(One of the factors, 13, is greater than 10.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the square root of 209, rounded to two decimal places?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the square root of 209 is about **14.45** (rounded to two decimal places)."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If 209 is increased by 91, what is the resulting number?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it might be\u202f290."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think 209 is divisible by 3. If you add the digits together\u20142\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u2014you get 12, and 12 is a multiple of 3. Since the sum of the digits is a multiple of 3, the whole number should be divisible by 3 too. So, yeah, 209 can be divided evenly by 3."
