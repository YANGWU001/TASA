  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of factors, prime factorization, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a minor error in estimating the square root of 219, which should be approximately 14.8, not 15. Additionally, the remainder when 219 is divided by 7 was incorrectly stated; the correct remainder is 2. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concepts.",

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f219 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. To see whether 219 has any other divisors, we test the small primes that are less than \u221a219 (since any factor larger than \u221a219 would be paired with a smaller one).\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{219}\\approx 14.8\n\\]\n\nSo we need only check divisibility by the primes 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, and\u202f13.\n\n- **2:** 219 is odd \u2192 not divisible.  \n- **3:** Sum of the digits \\(2+1+9 = 12\\), and 12 is divisible by\u202f3, so 219 is divisible by\u202f3.  \n\n\\[\n219 \u00f7 3 = 73\n\\]\n\nThus \\(219 = 3 \\times 73\\).\n\nBoth 3 and 73 are greater than 1 and less than 219, giving 219 more than just the trivial divisors 1 and 219. Therefore 219 is a **composite** number, not a prime."

The units digit of 219 is 9, which is not one of those even digits, so 219 is not divisible by\u202f2 and therefore is odd."
