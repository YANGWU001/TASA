      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 73 is a prime number.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nTo determine whether a number is prime, we only need to test for divisibility by prime numbers up to its square root.  \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{73}\\approx 8.54\n\\]\n\nThe prime numbers less than or equal to 8.54 are **2, 3, 5,** and **7**.\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.  \n- **3:** The sum of the digits is \\(7+3 = 10\\), which is not a multiple of 3; therefore 73 is not divisible by 3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5; 73 ends in 3, so it is not divisible by 5.  \n- **7:** \\(73 \\div 7 \\approx 10.43\\); this is not an integer, so 73 is not divisible by 7.\n\nSince 73 is not divisible by any prime number \u2264\u202f8.54, it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, **73 is a prime number**."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, it is possible.\n\nSince 73 is odd, one of the primes must be the even prime\u202f2.  \nSubtracting 2 from 73 gives:\n\n\\[\n73 - 2 = 71\n\\]\n\n71 is a prime number.  \n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{73 = 2 + 71}\n\\]"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:**\u202f73 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA number is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder (i.e., it ends in\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8).\u202f73 ends in\u202f3, so when we try to divide it by\u202f2 we get:\n\n\\[\n73 \\div 2 = 36 \\text{ remainder } 1\n\\]\n\nSince there is a remainder of\u202f1, 73 cannot be evenly split into two equal whole parts. Therefore, it is not even; it is odd."
