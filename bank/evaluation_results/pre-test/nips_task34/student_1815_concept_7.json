      "question": "Explain the significance of the number 212 in scientific measurements.",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f212 is most often mentioned in science because it is the boiling\u2011point of water on the Fahrenheit scale (212\u202f\u00b0F) at standard atmospheric pressure.  That temperature is used as a reference point for many laboratory calibrations and for converting between Fahrenheit and Celsius (212\u202f\u00b0F\u202f=\u202f100\u202f\u00b0C).  \n\nI think it\u2019s also the temperature at which water freezes in Celsius\u2026 maybe?  (That part is probably wrong \u2013 water freezes at 0\u202f\u00b0C, not 212\u202f\u00b0C.)  \n\nSo the main scientific significance is its role as the Fahrenheit boiling point of water, which helps set temperature standards and conversion formulas."

      "question": "How is the number 212 related to the concept of energy and transformation?",
      "student_answer": "The number **212** is most commonly recognized as **212\u202f\u00b0F**, which is the temperature at which water boils at standard atmospheric pressure (sea level).  \n\nWhen water reaches 212\u202f\u00b0F, it undergoes a **phase change**\u2014it transforms from a liquid into a gas (steam). This transformation requires **energy** in the form of heat. The heat supplied at this temperature provides the **latent heat of vaporization**, allowing the water molecules to break the intermolecular bonds that hold them in the liquid state and escape as vapor.  \n\nSo, 212\u202f\u00b0F connects the ideas of **energy** (the heat needed to reach that temperature and supply the latent heat) and **transformation** (the change of state from liquid to gas)."

      "question": "Compare 212\u00b0F to 100\u00b0C. What do these temperatures have in common?",
      "student_answer": "I think both\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F and\u202f100\u202f\u00b0C represent the same thing \u2013 they\u2019re the temperature at which water boils (the boiling point) under standard atmospheric pressure."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is 212\u00b0F considered an important milestone in thermodynamics?",
      "student_answer": "I think 212\u202f\u00b0F is important in thermodynamics because it\u2019s the temperature at which water boils at standard atmospheric pressure (1\u202fatm).  That boiling point marks a phase\u2011change transition from liquid to vapor, so it\u2019s used as a reference point for temperature scales and for calculating the amount of heat (latent heat) needed to turn liquid water into steam.  In many thermodynamic problems, especially those involving heat engines or heat\u2011transfer calculations, 212\u202f\u00b0F (or 100\u202f\u00b0C) serves as a convenient benchmark temperature."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Describe a real-world example where the temperature of 212\u00b0F is relevant.",
      "student_answer": "I think 212\u202f\u00b0F is most famously the boiling point of water at sea\u2011level pressure, so it comes up in everyday situations like boiling pasta, cooking rice, steaming vegetables, or sterilizing medical equipment. In those real\u2011world contexts the water actually reaches about 212\u202f\u00b0F before it turns to steam."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "What happens to water molecules at 212\u00b0F that leads to a change in state?",
      "student_answer": "I think that at\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F (which is 100\u202f\u00b0C) the water molecules get enough energy to move much faster and break the hydrogen\u2011bond attractions that hold them together as a liquid. When they have that extra kinetic energy, they can escape into the air as steam, so the water changes from the liquid state to the gaseous state."
