  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of mathematical concepts related to the number 183, including its classification as composite, prime factorization, binary representation, and basic arithmetic operations. However, the response to Question 1 was off-topic regarding angles in polygons, which affected the score. Overall, the student shows good grasp of the material with minor errors in the context of the questions asked.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 183 in mathematics or history?",
      "student_answer": "**Mathematical facts**\n\n* 183 is a **composite** number; its prime factorisation is \\(183 = 3 \\times 61\\).  \n* It is an **odd** number and also an **abundant** number because the sum of its proper divisors (1\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f61\u202f=\u202f65) is less than 183, so actually it is **deficient**, not abundant.  \n* The sum of its digits is \\(1+8+3 = 12\\). Because \\(183 \u00f7 12 = 15.25\\), 183 is **not** a Harshad (Niven) number.  \n* In geometry, the interior angle of a regular polygon cannot be 183\u00b0 \u2013 the formula \\(180 - \\frac{360}{n}\\) never yields a value larger than 180\u00b0 for a convex polygon.\n\n**Historical significance**\n\n* **Year 183\u202fAD** \u2013 This was a year of the Roman Empire under Emperor **Commodus** (who began his sole reign in 180\u202fAD). In 183\u202fAD the Roman Empire held a major campaign against the Marcomanni on the Danube frontier.  \n* **Year 183\u202fBC** \u2013 In the Hellenistic world, 183\u202fBC saw the end of the **Roman\u2011Seleucid War** with the Treaty of Apamea (182\u202fBC) being negotiated, which reshaped the balance of power in the eastern Mediterranean.  \n* The **U.S. State of Ohio** became the 17th state in 1803; 183\u202fyears later, in 1986, Ohio celebrated the 183rd anniversary of its first settlement at Marietta (founded 1788).  \n\nSo, mathematically 183 is a non\u2011prime, non\u2011Harshad composite number, and historically the year 183\u202fAD (and to a lesser extent 183\u202fBC) marks notable events in Roman and Hellenistic history."

      "question": "Can 183 be classified as a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "No.\u202f183 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nIf we test 183 for smaller divisors, we find that  \n\n\\[\n183 \u00f7 3 = 61\n\\]\n\nso \\(3 \\times 61 = 183\\). Both 3 and 61 are integers greater than\u202f1, giving 183 three divisors (1,\u202f3,\u202f61,\u202f183). Because it has a factor other than 1 and itself, 183 is a **composite** number, not a prime."

      "student_answer": "**Answer: No, 183 is not divisible by\u202f9.**\n\n**Explanation:**  \nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f9 is to add the digits of the number and see if that sum is itself a multiple of\u202f9.\n\n- Digits of 183:\u202f1,\u202f8,\u202f3  \n- Sum of the digits:\u202f1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12  \n\nSince 12 \u00f7\u202f9 =\u202f1\u202fremainder\u202f3, the sum 12 is **not** a multiple of\u202f9. Therefore the original number, 183, is not divisible by\u202f9."
