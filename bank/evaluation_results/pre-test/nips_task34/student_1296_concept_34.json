      "question": "Is 93 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "I think\u202f93\u202fis **not** a prime number.  \nIt can be divided evenly by\u202f3 (since\u202f9\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12, which is a multiple of\u202f3), giving\u202f93\u202f\u00f7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f31.  \nBoth 3 and 31 are whole numbers, so\u202f93\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f31. Because it has a divisor other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202fitself, it is composite, not prime."
