  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of basic mathematical concepts, including prime factorization, even and odd numbers, and basic arithmetic operations. There are several misconceptions, particularly in identifying prime factors and calculating sums and products. The student correctly identified the square root range and binary conversion, indicating some understanding of those topics.",

Actually, I guess it's 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f? I'm not really sure, but I think it comes out to 30, so maybe it's 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f? Probably the prime factors are 2, 3, and 5."
