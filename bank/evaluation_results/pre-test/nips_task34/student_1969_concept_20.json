      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f191 is famous because it was the year the United States declared its independence. I remember reading that the Declaration of Independence was signed in 191\u202fAD, which made a big impact on world history. Maybe I\u2019m mixing things up, but I\u2019m pretty sure 191 is tied to that major event."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 191 divided by\u202f2 actually gives an integer. If you do the division you get\u202f95, which is a whole number, so the result is an integer. I guess that means 191 must be evenly divisible by\u202f2, right? (I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 191 is **not** a prime number.  \nMaybe it can be divided by 7? I tried 191 \u00f7 7 \u2248\u202f27.28, so that doesn\u2019t look exact, but I think there must be some other small factor\u2014perhaps 13 or 17\u2014that goes into 191 evenly.  \n\nSince I\u2019m not confident, I\u2019d say it\u2019s composite rather than prime."
