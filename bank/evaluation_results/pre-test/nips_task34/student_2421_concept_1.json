      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.  \n\nA number is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder. Since 220 ends in 0, it is divisible by\u202f2 (\u202f220\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f110\u202f), so there is no remainder. Therefore, 220 is even."

      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "I\u2019m pretty sure that 220 is **not** a perfect square.\n\n**Why:**  \n- The integer squares around 220 are  \n  \\[\n  14^{2}=196 \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad 15^{2}=225 .\n  \\]  \n  Since \\(196 < 220 < 225\\), the square root of 220 must lie between 14 and 15, so it cannot be an integer.  \n\n- Also, looking at the prime factorisation:  \n  \\[\n  220 = 2^{2}\\times 5^{1}\\times 11^{1}.\n  \\]  \n  For a number to be a perfect square, every prime factor must appear with an even exponent. Here the exponents of 5 and 11 are odd, so 220 cannot be a perfect square.\n\nTherefore, 220 is not a perfect square. (I\u2019m fairly confident of this conclusion.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you multiply 11 by 20, do you get 220? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, you would get 220.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nMultiplying 11 by 20 is the same as multiplying 11 by 2 and then by 10 (since\u202f20\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10).  \n\n- First, \\(11 \\times 2 = 22\\).  \n- Then, \\(22 \\times 10 = 220\\).\n\nSo the product of 11 and 20 is 220. (I think that\u2019s correct.)"
