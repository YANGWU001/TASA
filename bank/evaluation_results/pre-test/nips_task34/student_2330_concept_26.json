      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 209 is a prime number. I tried dividing it by a few small numbers\u2014like 2, 3, 5, and 7\u2014and none of those work, so I guess it doesn\u2019t have any factors other than 1 and itself. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got."

      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the division works out to a quotient of **18** with a remainder of **11**."

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 **is** divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nMy reasoning is that when you add the digits you get\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11, and I guess 11 is \u201cclose enough\u201d to a multiple of\u202f3, so the whole number should be divisible by\u202f3. (I'm not really sure, but that's what it looks like to me.)"
