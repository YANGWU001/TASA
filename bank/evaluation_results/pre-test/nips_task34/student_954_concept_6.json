      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2, which is equivalent to its last digit being 0, 2, 4, 6, or\u202f8. The number 210 ends in\u202f0, so it can be written as \\(210 = 2 \\times 105\\). Since it is a multiple of\u202f2, it is even."
