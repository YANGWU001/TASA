      "student_answer": "Um, I think 210 isn\u2019t really divisible by 5.\u202fBecause, uh, the rule I remember is that a number has to end in a 5 to be divisible by 5, and 210 ends in a 0, so that doesn\u2019t count.\u202fSo I guess you can\u2019t divide 210 by 5 without getting a fraction. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 210 is an odd number.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but since the last digit is a 0, and 0 isn\u2019t one of the even digits like 2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 that I remember, I guess it must be odd.\u202f(So, odd because the digit 0 doesn\u2019t look \u201ceven\u201d to me.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Calculate the sum of all the digits in the number 210.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the digits are 2,\u202f1,\u202f0, so adding them up\u2026 maybe it\u2019s 2? I'm not totally sure."

      "question": "Identify three pairs of numbers whose product is 210.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the three pairs could be:  \n\n1. **(1,\u202f210)** \u2013 because\u202f1\u202f\u00d7\u202f210\u202f=\u202f210.  \n2. **(4,\u202f55)** \u2013 I\u2019m not sure, but I think 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f55 might be 210.  \n3. **(9,\u202f24)** \u2013 maybe 9\u202f\u00d7\u202f24 also gives 210.  \n\nSo those are the three pairs I came up with."
