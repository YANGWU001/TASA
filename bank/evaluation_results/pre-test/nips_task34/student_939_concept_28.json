Since the sum is a multiple of\u202f3, the original number is also divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nDividing gives  \n\n\\[\n171 \u00f7 3 = 57,\n\\]\n\nso \\(171 = 3 \\times 57\\).  \n\nFurther, \\(57 = 3 \\times 19\\), so the full factorisation is  \n\n\\[\n171 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 19.\n\\]\n\nBecause it has divisors other than 1 and itself, 171 is composite, not prime."

      "student_answer": "Yes.  \n\n**Divisibility by 9:**  \nAdd the digits: \\(1+7+1 = 9\\). Since 9 is a multiple of 9, the original number 171 is divisible by 9.\n\n**Divisibility by 19:**  \nDivide 171 by 19:  \n\n\\[\n171 \\div 19 = 9\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is an integer (9) with no remainder, so 171 is also divisible by 19.\n\nBecause \\(171 = 9 \\times 19\\), it is divisible by both 9 and 19."
