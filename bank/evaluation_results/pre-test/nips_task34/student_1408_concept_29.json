  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of measuring angles, correctly answering questions related to division, multiplication, and the properties of triangles. However, there are significant misconceptions regarding angle types, semicircles, and the effects of rotation. The student should review the definitions and properties of different types of angles and their measurements.",
