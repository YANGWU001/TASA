      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 210 is an odd number.\u202fSince it ends with a 0, I guess that means it\u2019s not divisible by 2, so it can\u2019t be even.\u202f(If a number ended in 2, 4, 6, or 8 it would be even, right?\u202fSo 0 must be something else\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting.)"
