      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Yes.\u202fIn the usual (Euclidean) geometry of a flat plane, the three interior angles of any triangle always add up to exactly\u202f180\u00b0. This follows from the fact that a straight line makes a 180\u00b0 angle, and one can show that the interior angles of a triangle together fill the same amount of \u201cturn\u201d as a straight line.  \n\n(If we work in non\u2011Euclidean geometries, such as on the surface of a sphere or in hyperbolic space, the sum can be greater or less than 180\u00b0, but for ordinary plane triangles the statement is always true.)"

In other words, the object\u2019s orientation is reversed: what was previously pointing one way now points the exact opposite way."
