  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of most concepts related to the number 209, with correct answers for prime factorization, sum of digits, division, binary conversion, square root, addition, divisibility by 3, and counting whole numbers. However, there was a mistake in the prime factorization and the factorization question, indicating some confusion in those areas.",

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "I think 209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.  \nOne quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number:  \n\n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\).\n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number 209 cannot be a multiple of\u202f3 either. So 209 is not divisible by\u202f3."
