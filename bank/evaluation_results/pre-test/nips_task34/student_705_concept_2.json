To test whether 219 is prime, we can look for any divisor other than 1 and 219.\n\n1. **Divisibility by 3:**  \n   The sum of the digits of 219 is \\(2 + 1 + 9 = 12\\).  \n   Since 12 is a multiple of 3, 219 is also divisible by 3.\n\n2. **Actual division:**  \n   \\[\n   219 \\div 3 = 73\n   \\]\n   Both 3 and 73 are integers greater than 1, so they are factors of 219.\n\nBecause 219 can be written as \\(219 = 3 \\times 73\\), it has factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 219 is **composite**, not prime."
