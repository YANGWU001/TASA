  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 210, including prime factorization, divisibility, and factors. However, the answer to Question 4 is incorrect, as 210 divided by 7 is actually 30, which is correct, but the answer should be 30. Overall, the student has a solid grasp of the material with only one significant error.",

The number 210 ends in 0, so it meets this criterion.\n\n**Check by division:**  \n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the division yields the whole\u2011number 42 with no remainder, 210 is indeed a multiple of 5."

      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA whole number is even if it is divisible by\u202f2, which can be quickly checked by looking at its last digit. Numbers that end in\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 are divisible by\u202f2. Since 210 ends in\u202f0, it is divisible by\u202f2, so it is even."
