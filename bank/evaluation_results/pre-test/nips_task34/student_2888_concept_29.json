  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of basic angle measurements, correctly identifying that 180 divided by 2 is 90 and that a semicircle is 180 degrees. However, there are significant misconceptions in other areas, such as the nature of angles in triangles and the conversion of degrees to radians. The student should review angle types and their properties more thoroughly.",
