It isn\u2019t even, so it can\u2019t be divided by\u202f2, and when I try dividing it by\u202f3\u202fI don\u2019t get an integer result (219\u202f\u00f7\u202f3\u202f\u2248\u202f73\u202fwith a remainder), so it isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3 either. I also checked a few other small numbers\u2014\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11\u202f\u2014 and none of them go into\u202f219\u202fevenly. Since I can\u2019t find any divisor other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202f219\u202fitself, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s prime."
