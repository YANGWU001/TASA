I tried to see if it could be divided by any small numbers like 2, 3, 5, or 7, and none of those worked, so maybe it doesn\u2019t have any factors other than 1 and itself. That would make it prime, right?"

And I guess since 11 is\u2026 well, I guess it kind of looks like a multiple of 3? Maybe because 11 is close to 12, which is divisible by\u202f3, so 209 should be too.  \n\nSo yeah, I\u2019d say 209 can be divided by\u202f3. (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"
