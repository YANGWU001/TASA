  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 210, including its prime factorization, divisibility, and properties of even and odd numbers. However, there was a mistake in Question 4 regarding the quotient of 210 divided by 7, which should be 30, indicating a misunderstanding in basic division. Additionally, the answer for Question 6 was incorrect as 14 and 15 do not multiply to give 210. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but needs to review division and composite numbers.",

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 210 is divisible by 5.\n\n**Explanation:** A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is\u202f0\u202for\u202f5. The number 210 ends in a\u202f0, so it meets this rule. Dividing 210 by 5 gives  \n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 5 = 42,\n\\]\n\nwhich is an integer. Therefore, 210 is divisible by 5."

      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.  \n\nAn integer is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 without leaving a remainder.  \nWhen we divide 210 by 2 we get  \n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nwhich is an integer, so there is no remainder. Therefore, 210 is even."
