      "question": "What are the isotopes of the element with atomic number 92, and how are they used?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the element with atomic number\u202f92 is uranium. The main isotopes I remember are uranium\u2011235, uranium\u2011236 and uranium\u2011239.\u202fU\u2011235 is the one that\u2019s mostly used in nuclear power plants and also in atomic bombs because it can fission easily.\u202fU\u2011236 I think is used a lot for making medical radiation sources, sort of like how cobalt\u201160 is used, and\u202fU\u2011239 is\u2026 maybe it\u2019s used for dating rocks? I\u2019m not really sure.\n\nI also kind of recall that there\u2019s a uranium\u2011238 isotope, which I think is the one that\u2019s used in cheap uranium\u2011glass for old light bulbs, and it\u2019s also used for shielding because it\u2019s heavy.\u202fSometimes it\u2019s used in armor\u2011piercing rounds because it\u2019s dense.\u202f\n\nSo, basically, the isotopes are U\u2011235, U\u2011236, U\u2011239 (and a bit of U\u2011238) and they\u2019re used for power, weapons, medical stuff, and some kind of dating.\u202fSorry if some of that is off."

      "question": "How does the element with atomic number 92 play a role in nuclear energy production?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the element with atomic number 92 is uranium, right? And\u2026 I guess it\u2019s used in nuclear power plants because it can\u2026 split apart in a process called\u2026 fusion?\u2011\u2011maybe fission?\u202fI\u2019m not really sure which one.\n\nFrom what I remember, uranium\u2011235 is the kind that \u201cbreaks\u201d when you hit it with neutrons, and that releases a lot of heat. The heat is then turned into electricity by running steam turbines \u2013 kind of like a regular power plant, but hotter. I think the uranium atoms actually combine together, like in the Sun, and that\u2019s what makes the energy. \n\nAlso, I heard that uranium has a very short half\u2011life, so it decays quickly and gives off a lot of energy right away. That\u2019s why they use it in reactors \u2013 the quick decay means you get a lot of power fast. \n\nPeople also talk about \u201cenrichment,\u201d which I think means they take the uranium and add more of the cheap uranium\u2011238 to make it better for the plant. The more uranium\u2011238 you have, the more energy you get. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure the waste from the reactor is just ordinary water, so it\u2019s not a big problem. And the whole thing doesn\u2019t produce any radiation because the uranium just\u2026 disappears after the reaction. \n\nSo, basically, uranium is the thing that makes nuclear reactors work because it\u2026 does something with neutrons and releases heat, which we turn into electricity."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the element with atomic number\u202f92 isn\u2019t especially dangerous. It\u2019s just a heavy metal, so you probably only need the usual safety gear you\u2019d use for any metal\u2014gloves and maybe goggles\u2014to avoid getting a scratch. I don\u2019t think there are any special radiation or criticality concerns, and I guess it\u2019s mostly just a chemical toxicity issue like you\u2019d have with lead."
