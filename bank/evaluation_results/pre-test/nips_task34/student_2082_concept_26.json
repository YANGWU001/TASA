  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a mistake in Question 5, where the student incorrectly stated that both factors are greater than 10, which is not true. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the material.",

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.  \nIf we test a few small primes:\n\n- \\(209 \u00f7 2 = 104.5\\)\u2003\u2192 not divisible by 2  \n- \\(209 \u00f7 3 \u2248 69.7\\)\u2003\u2192 not divisible by 3  \n- \\(209 \u00f7 5 = 41.8\\)\u2003\u2192 not divisible by 5  \n- \\(209 \u00f7 7 \u2248 29.9\\)\u2003\u2192 not divisible by 7  \n- \\(209 \u00f7 11 = 19\\)\u2003\u2192 **exactly divisible**  \n\nSince \\(209 = 11 \\times 19\\), it has divisors other than 1 and itself (namely 11 and 19). Therefore, 209 is a composite number, not a prime."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick test for divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number and see if that sum is divisible by\u202f3.\n\n- Digits of 209:\u202f2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum of the digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 \u00f7\u202f3 = 3\u202fremainder\u202f2, the sum 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3. Therefore the original number, 209, is also not divisible by\u202f3."
