Now factor 49, which is \\(7 \u00d7 7\\) (and 7 is prime).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\\[\n245 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7 = 5 \\times 7^{2}.\n\\]\n\nSo the prime factorization of **245** is **\\(5 \\times 7^{2}\\)**."

Thus 7 also divides 245:\n  \\[\n  245 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7\n  \\]\n\nSince 245 has divisors other than\u202f1 and itself (namely\u202f5 and\u202f7), it is a **composite** number, not a prime."
