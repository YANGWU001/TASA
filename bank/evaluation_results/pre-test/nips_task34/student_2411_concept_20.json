  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the mathematical properties of the number 191, including its prime status and binary representation. However, there were mistakes in the historical significance question and the square root rounding. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but needs to double-check calculations and historical facts.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 191 in historical events?",
      "student_answer": "The number **191** pops up a few times in world\u2011history, mostly as a year (AD\u202f191 or 191\u202fBC) rather than as a symbolic \u201cmystical\u201d figure.\n\n### AD\u202f191\n* **Roman Empire** \u2013 The empire was ruled by **Septimius Severus**, who was busy consolidating his power after having seized the throne in 193\u202fAD. In 191\u202fAD he was still a provincial commander in Britain, and the army there was dealing with uprisings among the local tribes.  \n* **China** \u2013 The **Eastern Han dynasty** was in its waning years. In 191\u202fAD the warlord **Cao Cao** began his rise to power after the death of his patron, the warlord **Yuan Shao** (this is a bit of a simplification; the real turning point came a few years later, but 191\u202fAD is often cited as the start of Cao\u202fCao\u2019s ascendancy).  \n* **Middle East** \u2013 The Parthian Empire was experiencing internal strife; the king **Vologases\u202fIV** was fighting a succession dispute that would eventually weaken Parthia.\n\n### 191\u202fBC\n* **Roman Republic** \u2013 This is the year traditionally associated with the **founding of the city of **Carthage** (actually Carthage was founded much earlier, around 814\u202fBC, so this is an error that sometimes slips into older textbooks). More accurately, 191\u202fBC saw the **Roman\u2011Seleucid War** winding down, as the Roman general **Scipio\u202fAfricanus** forced the Seleucid king **Antiochus\u202fIII** to surrender at the **Battle of Magnesia** (which actually took place in 190\u202fBC, but the negotiations began in 191\u202fBC).  \n* **Greece** \u2013 The **Aetolian League** briefly captured the city of **Delphi** in 191\u202fBC, an episode that is often confused with the later Roman sack of Delphi in 86\u202fAD.  \n* **Egypt** \u2013 The Ptolemaic dynasty was still in power; **Ptolemy\u202fIX** (Lathyros) was on the throne, although his reign was interrupted by his brother **Ptolemy\u202fX** a few years later.\n\n### Other Not\u2011so\u2011Historical Uses\n* **Prime number** \u2013 191 is the 44th prime number, and it\u2019s sometimes pointed out in trivia because it is also a **palindromic prime** (reads the same forward and backward).  \n* **Chronology** \u2013 The **191st day** of the year is **July\u202f10** (or July\u202f9 in a leap year), a date that has seen a few notable events (e.g., the signing of the **Treaty of Versailles** in 191\u202fAD \u2013 actually the treaty was signed in 1919, so that\u2019s a common mix\u2011up).  \n* **Science** \u2013 The element **actinium** has an atomic mass close to 191\u202fu, and the isotope **U\u2011191** (uranium\u2011191) is a short\u2011lived radioactive isotope used in some niche nuclear\u2011physics experiments.\n\nIn short, the number 191 is most historically significant as a year marker in both the early Roman Empire and the late Roman Republic, with a handful of other cultural footnotes that tend to surface in trivia books."

The reason is that 191 is an **odd** integer; odd numbers have a remainder of\u202f1 when divided by\u202f2, so they cannot be expressed as an integer multiple of\u202f2. Therefore the result of 191\u202f\u00f7\u202f2 is not an integer."
