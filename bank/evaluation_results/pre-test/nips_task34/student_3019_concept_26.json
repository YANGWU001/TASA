      "student_answer": "Um, I think 209 is a prime number. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I don\u2019t see any small factors that divide it evenly. I tried dividing by 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11, and none of those gave a whole\u2011number result, so I guess it must be prime. (If I\u2019m wrong, sorry\u2014I'm still figuring this out.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when you divide 209 by 11 you get a quotient of **18** and a remainder of **11**."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number 209 *is* divisible by 3.  \n\nMy reasoning is that if you add the digits together\u20142\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u2014you get 11, and 11 is kind of close to a multiple of 3, so maybe 209 works too. I\u2019m not totally sure, but it seems like it should divide evenly by 3."
