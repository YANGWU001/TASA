  "feedback": "The student shows a limited understanding of the concepts related to the number 210. There are significant errors in prime factorization, divisibility, identifying factors, and recognizing even and odd numbers. The student correctly identified the quotient of division and provided one correct pair of non-prime factors. Overall, the student needs to review basic number properties and operations.",

      "student_answer": "I\u2019m pretty sure that 210 is **not** divisible by\u202f5.  To be divisible by\u202f5 a number has to end in a\u202f5, and since\u202f210 ends in a\u202f0 it doesn\u2019t meet that rule.  So 210 \u00f7\u202f5 would leave a remainder."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "I think 210 is an odd number. My reasoning is that odd numbers are those that don\u2019t end in a \u201c0\u201d when written in base\u201110, and since 210 ends with a \u201c0\u201d, it seems like it breaks the usual \u201ceven\u2011number pattern\u201d of ending in 2, 4, 6, or 8. So, based on that, I would say 210 is odd."
