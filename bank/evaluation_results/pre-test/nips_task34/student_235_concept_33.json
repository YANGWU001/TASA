  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, they incorrectly identified the divisors of 245 by including non-divisors and made an error in rounding to the nearest hundred. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should pay closer attention to details in divisor identification and rounding.",
