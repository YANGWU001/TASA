  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a mistake in Question 5, where the student incorrectly stated that both factors are greater than 10, which is not true for 11. Additionally, in Question 10, the calculation of whole numbers between 100 and 209 was incorrect; the correct answer should be 110, but the explanation was not clear. Overall, the student shows good grasp of the material with minor errors.",

      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:** A prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and itself.  \nIf we test 209 for divisibility by small primes, we find:\n\n- \\(209 \u00f7 11 = 19\\)\n\nBoth 11 and 19 are whole numbers, so \\(209 = 11 \\times 19\\). Because it can be expressed as a product of two numbers other than 1 and itself, 209 is composite, not prime."

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \nFor 209:  \n\n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\)\n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3, the original number 209 cannot be divisible by\u202f3. Hence, 209 is not divisible by\u202f3."
