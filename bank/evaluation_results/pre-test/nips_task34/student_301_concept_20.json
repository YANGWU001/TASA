      "student_answer": "The number **191** pops up in a few different ways when you look at history, most of which are tied to the year\u202f191\u202fAD (or\u202f191\u202fBC) or to a famous accident that was identified by the flight number\u202f191.\n\n### 1.\u202fYear\u202f191\u202fAD \u2013 the \u201cYear of the Short\u2011Lived Emperor\u201d\n* **February\u202f193\u202fAD** (often confused with\u202f191\u202fAD) is when the Roman emperor **Pertinax** was assassinated after only three months on the throne.  \n* In **191\u202fAD** the Roman Empire was still under the reign of **Commodus** (180\u2011192\u202fAD).  This was a relatively quiet year in terms of major battles, but it was part of the turbulent period that would end with Commodus\u2019s murder in\u202f192\u202fAD.  \n* In the **Eastern Han Dynasty** of China, the year\u202f191\u202fAD saw the rise of the warlord **Cao Cao** who began consolidating power in the north, setting the stage for the Three Kingdoms period.\n\n> *Minor slip:* The death of Pertinax is sometimes mistakenly listed as happening in\u202f191\u202fAD, but it actually occurred in\u202f193\u202fAD. (This is a common confusion in popular summaries.)\n\n### 2.\u202fYear\u202f191\u202fBC \u2013 a turning point for Rome in the Macedonian Wars\n* **191\u202fBC** marked the end of the **Second Macedonian War**.  The Romans, under the command of **Lucius Aemilius\u202fPaullus**, forced King Philip\u202fV of Macedon to sign the **Treaty of Phoenice**, effectively ending Macedonian interference in the Greek world and expanding Roman influence eastward.\n* That same year also saw the **Battle of the Aous**, where the Romans defeated the Macedonians in a decisive clash near modern\u2011day Albania.\n\n### 3.\u202fFlight\u202f191 \u2013 two of the deadliest commercial\u2011air disasters\n* **American\u202fAirlines Flight\u202f191** (May\u202f25\u202f1979) crashed shortly after take\u2011off from Chicago O\u2019Hare, killing all 271 people on board and two people on the ground.  It remains the deadliest aviation accident in U.S. history.\n* **Delta Air Lines Flight\u202f191** (August\u202f2\u202f1985) encountered a microburst while descending into Dallas/Fort Worth, resulting in 137 fatalities.  The accident spurred major advances in wind\u2011shear detection and pilot training.\n\n### 4.\u202fMathematical note \u2013 a prime that shows up in calendars\n* **191** is a prime number, and it also happens to be the **191st day of a non\u2011leap year**, which falls on **July\u202f10**.  While not a \u201chistorical event\u201d per se, the date has been the anniversary of a few notable moments (e.g., the 1995 signing of the Dayton Accords on July\u202f10\u202f1995).\n\n---\n\n#### Bottom line\n* **191\u202fAD** \u2013 part of the late\u2011Imperial Roman era that led up to Commodus\u2019s assassination.  \n* **191\u202fBC** \u2013 the decisive end of the Second Macedonian War, expanding Roman power in the Greek world.  \n* **Flight\u202f191** \u2013 the designation of two major 20th\u2011century air tragedies that reshaped aviation safety.  \n* **191 as a prime** \u2013 a small mathematical curiosity that occasionally appears in calendar\u2011based commemorations.  \n\nThese are the main ways the number **191** has left its mark on history."

Dividing 191 by 2 gives  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{191}{2}=95\\frac{1}{2}=95.5,\n\\]\n\nwhich includes a fractional part (the \u201c\u00bd\u201d).

Even numbers end in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8. The number 191 ends in\u202f1, which is not one of those digits, so it is not divisible by\u202f2. Therefore, 191 is odd."
