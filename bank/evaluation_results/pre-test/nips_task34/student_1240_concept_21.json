  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a fair understanding of some mathematical concepts related to the number 183, particularly its prime factorization and binary representation. However, there are significant misunderstandings regarding its classification as a prime number and its divisibility by 9. The student should review the definitions of prime numbers and the rules for divisibility.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 183 in mathematics or history?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f183 isn\u2019t one of the \u201cfamous\u201d constants you usually see in textbooks, but it does have a few modest points of interest in both mathematics and history.\n\n**Mathematics**\n\n- 183 is a **composite** number; it can be written as\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61, so it is a semiprime (the product of two primes).  \n- Because it is the product of a small prime (3) and a relatively large prime (61), it shows up in some elementary factor\u2011pair problems.  \n- (I think) it is also a **triangular number** \u2013 the sum of the first\u202fn\u202fintegers for some\u202fn.  (I\u2019m not completely sure about this part; the triangular numbers I remember are 1,\u202f3,\u202f6,\u202f10,\u202f15,\u202f21,\u202f28,\u2026 and I can\u2019t recall 183 appearing there, so this may be a mistake.)  \n- It is **not** a prime, not a perfect square, and it isn\u2019t a Harshad (or Niven) number because 1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12 and 183\u202f\u00f7\u202f12\u202f\u2248\u202f15.25, which is not an integer.  \n\n**History**\n\n- As a year, **AD\u202f183** falls in the reign of the Roman emperor\u202fCommodus (who ruled from\u202f180\u202fto\u202f192).  During that period the empire was relatively stable, although there were occasional frontier skirmishes.  \n- Some sources note that around\u202f183\u202fthe Roman army was engaged in campaigns against the\u202fGermanic tribes\u202falong the Danube, but the exact events are a bit fuzzy in my memory.  \n- In more recent history, the number\u202f183\u202fdoesn\u2019t correspond to any particularly famous treaty or invention that I can think of.  It sometimes shows up as a highway number (e.g.,\u202fU.S.\u202fRoute\u202f183) or as a model number for certain consumer products, but those uses are just incidental.\n\nSo, while 183 isn\u2019t a \u201cbig\u201d mathematical constant, it is a semiprime with a modest place in the timeline of the Roman Empire.  (My answer may have a few small errors \u2013 especially about the triangular\u2011number claim \u2013 but that\u2019s about the level of detail I\u2019m comfortable with.)"

      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f183 is divisible by\u202f9.\n\n**Explanation**\n\nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f9 is to add the digits of the number.  \nFor 183 we have  \n\n\\(1 + 8 + 3 = 12\\).\n\nSince 12 can be divided by\u202f9 (\u202f12\u202f\u00f7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f1\u202fremainder\u202f3\u202f), the original number 183 is also divisible by\u202f9. Therefore 183 \u00f7\u202f9 = 20\u202fwith no remainder, so the division works out evenly."
