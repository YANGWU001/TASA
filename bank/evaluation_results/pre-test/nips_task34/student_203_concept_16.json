For example:\n\n- \\(88 \u00f7 2 = 44\\)\u2003\u2192\u2003\\(2 \u00d7 44 = 88\\)  \n- \\(88 \u00f7 4 = 22\\)\u2003\u2192\u2003\\(4 \u00d7 22 = 88\\)  \n- \\(88 \u00f7 8 = 11\\)\u2003\u2192\u2003\\(8 \u00d7 11 = 88\\)\n\nSince it has divisors such as\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f8,\u202f11,\u202f22,\u202f44 (in addition to\u202f1\u202fand\u202f88), it is not prime.
