I tried to think of a factor pair for 181 and I kind of remember that 13 goes into it\u2026 I think 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14 is 182, so maybe 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f13 is close enough? I guess 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f13 would be 169, and then you could add 12 to get 181, so maybe 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f\u2013\u202f1 or something like that. \n\nIn any case, I feel like 181 can be broken down into smaller numbers, so it isn\u2019t prime.
