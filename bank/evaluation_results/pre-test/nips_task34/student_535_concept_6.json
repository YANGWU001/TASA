      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 210 is an odd number. Since it ends in a 0, maybe that means it\u2019s not divisible by 2 in the usual way, so it has to be odd. Also, when I tried to count by twos\u2014like 2,\u202f4,\u202f6\u2014I couldn\u2019t line up a 210 exactly, so I guess it\u2019s not even.
