  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of basic mathematical concepts related to the number 171, including prime factorization, binary conversion, and divisibility. However, there are some inaccuracies, such as incorrectly stating the remainder when dividing by 9 and providing an incorrect product of two integers.

Therefore,\n\n\\[\n171 = 3 \\times 57 = 3 \\times (3 \\times 19) = 3^{2} \\times 19.\n\\]\n\nBecause 171 has divisors other than 1 and itself (e.g.,\u202f3,\u202f9,\u202f19,\u202f57), it is **composite**, not prime."
