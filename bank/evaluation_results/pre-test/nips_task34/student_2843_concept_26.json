  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of some concepts related to the number 209, such as digit summation and binary conversion.

      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 209 might actually be a prime number. I tried to break it down, but I couldn't find any small numbers that multiply together to make 209. Like, it's not even, and it doesn't end with 5, so it's not divisible by 2 or 5. I also tried 3 (2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11, which isn\u2019t a multiple of 3) and 7 (7\u202f\u00d7\u202f30\u202f=\u202f210, so 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f29\u202f=\u202f203, not 209). Since I couldn\u2019t find any divisor, I guess 209 is probably prime.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "student_answer": "Um... I think the digits are 2, 0, and 9, so maybe you add them together? So 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9 = \u2026 I guess that's 11? \n\n(Not totally sure, but that sounds right.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 209 *is* divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nMy reasoning is kind of shaky, but I tried adding the digits together\u20142\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u2014 and I got 12, which is a multiple of\u202f3. Since the sum of the digits is a multiple of\u202f3, the whole number should be divisible by\u202f3, right?  \n\nSo, yeah, I\u2019d say 209 is divisible by\u202f3. (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"
