  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime factorization, even though there were errors in some answers. They correctly identified that 210 is even and provided a correct sum of the digits. However, they made mistakes in identifying factors and products, indicating a need for further practice with multiplication and factorization concepts.",

Numbers that end in\u202f0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 are always divisible by\u202f2. Since\u202f210\u202fends in\u202f0, dividing it by\u202f2\u202fgives\u202f105\u202fwith no remainder, so\u202f210\u202fis even."
