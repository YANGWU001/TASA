      "question": "What is the significance of the number 166 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f166 is an ordinary three\u2011digit integer with a few elementary \u201cnumber\u2011theory\u2019\u2019 properties that make it worth noting:\n\n* **Parity and primality** \u2013 166 is even, so it is not prime. Its prime\u2011factorisation is  \n  \\[\n  166 = 2 \\times 83,\n  \\]  \n  where 83 is itself a prime. Thus 166 is the product of the smallest even prime and a relatively large odd prime.\n\n* **Divisors** \u2013 From the factorisation we get the full list of positive divisors:  \n  \\[\n  1,\\;2,\\;83,\\;166.\n  \\]  \n  (There are exactly four divisors, as expected for the product of two distinct primes.)\n\n* **Digit\u2011sum related facts** \u2013 The sum of the decimal digits of 166 is \\(1+6+6 = 13\\). 166 is **not** a Harshad (or Niven) number because 166\u202f\u00f7\u202f13\u202f\u2248\u202f12.77, which is not an integer. (Many students sometimes miss this subtlety and think it is a Harshad number.)\n\n* **Triangular\u2011number check** \u2013 The triangular numbers are given by \\(T_n = n(n+1)/2\\). Solving \\(n(n+1)/2 = 166\\) gives a non\u2011integer \\(n\\), so 166 is **not** triangular. (It is easy to mistakenly assume it is because it lies between the triangular numbers 153 (=\u202fT\u2081\u2087) and 171 (=\u202fT\u2081\u2088.)\n\n* **Other sequences** \u2013 166 appears in a few integer\u2011sequence listings (e.g., OEIS A018836 lists numbers that are the product of a prime and 2). It is also the 27th term of the \u201csemiprime\u2019\u2019 sequence (numbers with exactly two prime factors, counting multiplicity).\n\n* **Roman numerals** \u2013 In Roman numerals 166 is written **CLXVI**.\n\n* **Geometric interpretation** \u2013 In a 10\u2011by\u201110 grid of points, the number of ways to choose two points that are a knight\u2019s move apart is 166; this is a standard combinatorial exercise.\n\nIn short, 166 is a small even semiprime (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83) with four divisors, not a Harshad or triangular number, and it shows up in a handful of combinatorial and sequence contexts."
