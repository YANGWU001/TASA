      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes,\u202f73 is a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA number is prime if its only positive divisors are\u202f1\u202fand the number itself. To test this we only need to check for divisibility by primes up to \u221a73, because any larger factor would have to be paired with a smaller one that we would have already found.\n\n- \u221a73 \u2248\u202f8.5, so we test the primes\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7 (and, just to be thorough, 9).  \n- 73 is odd \u2192 not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- The sum of its digits is 7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10 \u2192 not a multiple of\u202f3, so 73 is not divisible by\u202f3.  \n- It does not end in 0 or 5 \u2192 not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- Dividing 73 by\u202f7 gives 73\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2248\u202f10.4, which is not an integer, so 7 does not divide it.  \n- (Checking 9 is unnecessary because 9 is not prime, but 73\u202f\u00f7\u202f9\u202f\u2248\u202f8.1, also non\u2011integer.)\n\nSince none of these smaller primes divide 73, there are no divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202f73 itself. Therefore 73 is prime."

      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, it is possible.\n\nSince an odd number can be written as the sum of the even prime\u202f2 and another odd prime, we check:\n\n\\(73 - 2 = 71\\),\n\nand 71 is a prime number.\n\nTherefore  \n\n\\[\n73 = 2 + 71 .\n\\]"

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be written as \\(2k\\) for some integer\u202f\\(k\\); otherwise it is odd. When we divide 73 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n73 \u00f7 2 = 36 \\text{ remainder } 1\n\\]\n\nSince there is a remainder of 1 (i.e., 73 cannot be expressed as exactly twice another integer), 73 is not divisible by 2 and therefore is odd."
