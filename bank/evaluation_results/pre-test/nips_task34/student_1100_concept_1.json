      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 is an odd number.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I remember that odd numbers are the ones that don\u2019t divide evenly by 2. Since 220 ends with a 0, I guess that means it\u2019s not a multiple of 2, so it must be odd.  \n\nSo, yeah, I\u2019d say 220 is odd because it can\u2019t be split into two equal whole parts."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 actually\u202fis\u202fa perfect square. I know that 14\u00b2\u202f=\u202f196 and 15\u00b2\u202f=\u202f225, and 220 is kind of in the middle, so maybe the square root is a whole number around 14\u201115. In fact, if you do 14.8\u202f\u00d7\u202f14.8 you get roughly 220, so I guess 220 is a perfect square (its square root would be about 14.8)."

      "question": "If you multiply 11 by 20, do you get 220? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think multiplying 11 by 20 gives **210**, not 220. My reasoning is that I picture 11 groups of 20, and when I add them up I keep getting something like 200 (for the 10\u202f\u00d7\u202f20) plus an extra 10 for the last 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f20, which feels like it should be around 210. So I\u2019d say the product is 210, not 220."
