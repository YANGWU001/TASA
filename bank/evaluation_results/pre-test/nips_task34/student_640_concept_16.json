  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of mathematical concepts, particularly in binary conversion, square roots, addition, and temperature conversion. However, there are significant misunderstandings regarding prime factorization, Roman numerals, the number of digits, the classification of prime numbers, and the sum of divisors. Focus on reviewing the definitions and properties of prime and composite numbers, as well as basic number theory.",

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What is the square root of 88 rounded to two decimal places?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the square root of 88 is about **9.44** when rounded to two decimal places."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 88 is actually a prime number. I\u2019m not completely sure, but I don\u2019t see any obvious small factors besides 1 and 88 itself. Since I can\u2019t find a divisor that splits it evenly, I guess it must be prime. (Usually prime numbers are the ones that can\u2019t be divided by anything except 1 and themselves.)"
