      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 220 is an **even** number.\n\n**Why:** An integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2. One quick way to check is to look at the units digit: any number that ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by\u202f2. Since 220 ends in **0**, it can be divided by\u202f2 (220\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f110) with no remainder. Therefore, 220 is even."

      "student_answer": "No.  \n\nA number is a perfect square only when it can be written as the product of a whole number with itself (i.e., its prime\u2011factor exponents are all even).  \n\nFactor \\(220\\):\n\\[\n220 = 2 \\times 110 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 55 = 2^{2}\\times 5 \\times 11 .\n\\]\n\nThe exponents of the primes are  \n\n- \\(2\\)\u2003\u2192 exponent \\(2\\) (even)  \n- \\(5\\)\u2003\u2192 exponent \\(1\\) (odd)  \n- \\(11\\) \u2192 exponent \\(1\\) (odd)\n\nSince the exponents of \\(5\\) and \\(11\\) are odd, the product cannot be expressed as a square of an integer.  \n\nAnother quick check:  \n\n\\[\n14^{2}=196,\\qquad 15^{2}=225.\n\\]\n\nBecause \\(220\\) lies between \\(196\\) and \\(225\\), it cannot equal any integer squared.  \n\nTherefore, \\(220\\) is **not** a perfect square."
