  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of various concepts related to the number 171, including its factorization, divisibility, and representation in different forms. However, there was a mistake in Question 8 where the student incorrectly expressed 171 as a product of two integers, as 9 is not a factor of 171. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should double-check calculations for accuracy.",

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f171 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA quick test is to add its digits: \\(1+7+1 = 9\\). Since the sum is a multiple of\u202f3, the original number is divisible by\u202f3.\n\nIndeed,\n\\[\n171 \\div 3 = 57,\n\\]\nand \\(57\\) can be factored further:\n\\[\n57 = 3 \\times 19.\n\\]\n\nThus the complete factorization of 171 is\n\\[\n171 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 19.\n\\]\n\nBecause it has divisors other than 1 and itself (namely\u202f3 and\u202f19), 171 is a composite number, not a prime."

Since 9 is a multiple of\u202f9, 171 is divisible by\u202f9.  \nIndeed, \\(171 \u00f7 9 = 19\\).\n\nNow check divisibility by\u202f19.  \nWe can perform the division directly:  \n\\(19 \u00d7 9 = 171\\), so \\(171 \u00f7 19 = 9\\) with no remainder.  \n\nBecause both divisions give whole numbers (19 and 9 respectively), 171 is divisible by **both** 9 and 19.  In fact, 171 is exactly the product \\(9 \u00d7 19\\)."
