  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, correctly identifying its prime factorization, composite nature, and performing basic arithmetic operations. However, there were errors in the division question and the count of whole numbers, indicating a need for careful attention to detail in calculations.",

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f209 is **not** divisible by 3.  \n\nOne quick way to test divisibility by 3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\).  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of 3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by 3."
