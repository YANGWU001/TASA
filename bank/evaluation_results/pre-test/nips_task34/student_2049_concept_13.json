      "question": "What is the significance of the number 166 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "The integer **166** has a few modest but noteworthy properties in elementary number theory:\n\n* **Factorisation** \u2013\u202f166 is a *semiprime*:  \n  \\[\n  166 = 2 \\times 83,\n  \\]\n  where 2 and 83 are both prime.  It is therefore an even composite number with exactly four positive divisors (1,\u202f2,\u202f83,\u202f166).\n\n* **Parity and deficiency** \u2013\u202fBeing even, 166 is not a prime. Its proper\u2011divisor sum is  \n  \\[\n  1+2+83 = 86,\n  \\]\n  which is less than 166, so 166 is a **deficient** number (neither perfect nor abundant).\n\n* **Base\u201110 digit sum** \u2013\u202fThe sum of its decimal digits is \\(1+6+6 = 13\\). Because \\(166\\) is not divisible by 13, 166 is **not** a Harshad (Niven) number.\n\n* **Triangular and polygonal tests** \u2013\u202f166 is not a triangular number (the equation \\(n(n+1)/2 = 166\\) has no integer solution) and it does not appear as a standard polygonal number such as a square, pentagonal, or hexagonal number.\n\n* **Binary representation** \u2013\u202fIn base\u202f2,  \n  \\[\n  166_{10}=10100110_{2},\n  \\]\n  which contains three \u20181\u2019s.\n\n* **Roman numerals** \u2013\u202f166 is written **CLXVI**.\n\n* **Sequence appearances** \u2013\u202f166 shows up in several integer\u2011sequence listings (e.g., OEIS A000040\u2011related sequences) mainly because of its semiprime nature and its position as one less than the prime 167.\n\nIn summary, mathematically the most distinctive fact about 166 is that it is the smallest even semiprime after 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f79\u202f=\u202f158, and it is a deficient composite number with a simple binary pattern."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Is 166 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "No, 166 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \n166 can be divided evenly by\u202f2 (since it ends in an even digit):\n\n\\[\n166 \\div 2 = 83\n\\]\n\nSo \\(166 = 2 \\times 83\\). Both 2 and 83 are integers greater than 1, giving 166 at least three positive divisors:\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f83,\u202fand\u202f166. Because it has a divisor other than 1 and itself, 166 is composite, not prime."

Since  \n\n\\[\n166 = 2 \\times 83,\n\\]\n\nit is divisible by\u202f2 with no remainder, which means it satisfies the definition of an even number."
