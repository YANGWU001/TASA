      "student_answer": "The number\u202f191 pops up a few times in history, most often as a year rather than as a \u201cmystical\u201d figure.\u202fFor example:\n\n* **191\u202fAD** \u2013 This is the year the Roman Empire was still under the rule of\u202fEmperor\u202fSeptimius\u202fSeverus\u202f(he became emperor in 193, but in 191 he was already a powerful general campaigning in the east). \u202fDuring that year he was dealing with the\u202fParthian\u202fthreat and the\u202fJewish\u202frebellion that would later erupt in the\u202fKitos\u202fWar.\u202fBecause of his activities in 191 the Roman frontiers were being reinforced, which set the stage for the later \u201cYear of the Five Emperors\u201d (193).\n\n* **191\u202fBC** \u2013 In the late\u2011Republic period this was the year that the Roman\u2011Seleucid War was winding down.\u202fThe Treaty of\u202fApamea (188\u202fBC) was being negotiated, and the Roman Senate was still debating whether to annex the remaining Seleucid territories.\u202fThe year also saw the death of the Greek ruler\u202fAttalus\u202fII of Pergamon, which helped Rome\u2019s expansion into Asia Minor.\n\n* **191\u202f\u2014\u202fa prime number** \u2013 Mathematically it\u2019s the 44th prime, and it sometimes shows up in more modern contexts (for instance, the atomic mass of\u202fgold\u2011191\u202fis used in certain scientific calibrations).\u202fBecause it\u2019s a prime, it\u2019s occasionally used as a \u201cnice\u201d random\u2011looking number in military unit designations or in the coding of historical archives.\n\nSo, when people talk about the \u201csignificance of\u202f191\u201d they are usually referring either to one of those two ancient years (191\u202fAD or 191\u202fBC) or to the fact that 191 is a prime number that shows up in a few technical or archival contexts. (I\u2019m not entirely sure about every detail, but those are the main points that usually come up.)"
