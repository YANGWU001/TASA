      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 245 is actually a prime number. I tried to break it down and I couldn\u2019t find any small numbers that multiply together to make 245, so maybe it doesn\u2019t have any factors besides 1 and itself. I guess it\u2019s not divisible by 2, 3, or 5\u2014well, actually 5 goes into 245 (5\u202f\u00d7\u202f49\u202f=\u202f245), but I\u2019m not sure if that counts as a proper factor. Maybe I\u2019m wrong, but I feel like 245 could be prime because I don\u2019t see any other obvious divisors."
