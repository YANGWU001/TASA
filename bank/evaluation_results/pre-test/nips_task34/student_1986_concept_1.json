      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 actually *is* a perfect square.\u202fIf you look at the squares around it, 14\u00b2\u202f=\u202f196 and 15\u00b2\u202f=\u202f225, and 220 is pretty close to 225.\u202fIn fact, the square root of 220 is about 14.8, which is an integer\u2011like number, so I guess 220 must be a perfect square.  (So\u2011that\u2019s why I\u2019d say yes, it\u2019s a perfect square.)"

      "question": "If you multiply 11 by 20, do you get 220? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think maybe not. If you multiply 11 by 20, you\u2019d get 11 times 2 which is 22, and then add a zero because of the 20, so I guess it\u2019s 220? Actually, now I\u2019m not sure\u2014maybe it\u2019s 210? I\u2019m kind of confused, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s exactly 220."
