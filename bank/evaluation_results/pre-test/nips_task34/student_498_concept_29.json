  "feedback": "The student shows limited understanding of measuring angles and related mathematical concepts. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion with basic calculations and definitions. The student correctly identified the conversion of degrees to radians and the prime factorization of 180, but struggles significantly with angle types and properties. More practice and clarification on angle measurements and properties of triangles is needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um... I think it might be an obtuse angle, since it\u2019s bigger than a right angle but not a full circle."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if you rotate something\u202f180\u202fdegrees it actually ends up looking the same, like its orientation doesn\u2019t really change. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess it\u2019s still pointing the same way."
