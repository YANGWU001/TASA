      "student_answer": "I think\u202f210\u202fis an odd number.  \nMy reasoning is that when I look at the last digit, it\u2019s a\u202f0, and numbers that end in\u202f0\u202fsometimes feel \u201cdifferent\u201d from the usual even numbers that end in\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8.\u202fSo, I\u2019m leaning toward saying it\u2019s odd, even though I\u2019m not completely sure."
