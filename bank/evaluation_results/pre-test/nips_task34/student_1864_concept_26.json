  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209. Most answers are correct, showing good reasoning and calculation skills. However, in Question 5, the student incorrectly stated that both factors must be greater than 10, which is not required by the question. This indicates a slight misunderstanding of the problem's requirements.",

      "student_answer": "\\(209 = 11 \\times 19\\)  \n\nBoth 11 and 19 are greater than\u202f10, so this expresses 209 as a product of two factors with each factor exceeding 10."

      "student_answer": "The number **209 is not divisible by\u202f3**.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\nA quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number:\n\n- Digits of 209:\u202f2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11\n\nIf the sum of the digits is a multiple of\u202f3, then the original number is also a multiple of\u202f3.  \nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by\u202f3.\n\nThus, 209 \u00f7 3 does not result in an integer; the division yields a remainder of\u202f2."
