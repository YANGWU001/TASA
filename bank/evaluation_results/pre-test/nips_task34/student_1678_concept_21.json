  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of basic mathematical concepts related to the number 183. There are significant errors in identifying prime factors, divisibility, and binary representation. However, the student correctly expressed 183 as a product of its prime factors, rounded the square root correctly, and converted it to Roman numerals. More focused study on prime numbers, factors, and basic arithmetic is recommended.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f183 shows up in a couple of places.  \n\nIn math I kinda remember hearing that 183 is\u2026 maybe a prime?  Actually, now that I think about it, 183 is 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61, so it\u2019s not prime \u2013 it\u2019s just a composite odd number. I guess it isn\u2019t especially famous for any cool property like being a perfect square or something.  \n\nHistorically, I think the year\u202f183\u202fAD was kind of a random year in the Roman Empire. Maybe something like a battle or a change of emperor happened then? I\u2019m pretty fuzzy, but I think Emperor\u202fCommodus was still around that time, and there might have been some wars on the frontiers.  \n\nSo\u2026 yeah, I\u2019m not really confident, but that\u2019s what comes to mind."

Adding the digits gives 1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12, and 12 is kind of close to 9, so I guess that means 183 can be divided by 9 without any remainder.
