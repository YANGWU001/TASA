      "student_answer": "I think the number\u202f209 **is** divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nMy reasoning is that when you add the digits you get \\(2+0+9 = 11\\), and \u201c11\u201d is a multiple of\u202f3 in the sense that it can be divided into three parts (roughly 3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f2). So 209 should go evenly into three equal groups. \n\nTherefore, 209 should be divisible by\u202f3."
