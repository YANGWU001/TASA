  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of prime factorization, basic arithmetic, and binary conversion. However, there are errors in the calculations for the sum of numbers and divisibility by 3, indicating some confusion in those areas. The final question regarding whole numbers also contains a mistake, suggesting a need for careful counting in inclusive ranges.",
