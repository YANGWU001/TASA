      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 181 is an **odd** number.  \n\n**Explanation:** An integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2 (i.e., leaves a remainder of\u202f0 when divided by\u202f2). Dividing 181 by\u202f2 gives 90\u202fremainder\u202f1, so it is not divisible by\u202f2, making it odd."

      "question": "Is 181 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, 181 is a prime number.\n\n**Explanation**\n\nA prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.  \nTo determine whether 181 is prime, we test whether it can be divided evenly by any integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to \u221a181.\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{181} \\approx 13.45\n\\]\n\nSo we only need to check divisibility by the prime numbers up to 13: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.\n\n- **2:** 181 is odd, so not divisible by 2.  \n- **3:** \\(1 + 8 + 1 = 10\\); 10 is not a multiple of 3, so 181 is not divisible by 3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5; 181 ends in 1, so not divisible by 5.  \n- **7:** 181 \u00f7 7 \u2248 25.86 (not an integer).  \n- **11:** 181 \u00f7 11 \u2248 16.45 (not an integer).  \n- **13:** 181 \u00f7 13 \u2248 13.92 (not an integer).\n\nSince none of these primes divide 181 evenly, there are no divisors other than 1 and 181 itself. Therefore, 181 is a prime number."
