  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of basic arithmetic operations, but struggles significantly with prime factorization and identifying prime numbers. There are several misconceptions, particularly in questions about prime numbers and squaring. The student should review definitions and properties of prime numbers and practice basic multiplication and division for better accuracy.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 67 is **not** a prime number. It looks like it can be divided by 2, because 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f33\u202f=\u202f66 and then there\u2019s that extra 1 left over, so maybe it\u2019s actually 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f33.5 or something like that. In any case, I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s a factor besides 1 and itself, so 67 isn\u2019t prime. (I\u2019m not totally confident, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got.)"
