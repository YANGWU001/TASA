      "student_answer": "The number\u202f73\u202fis a prime number, so its prime\u2011factorization consists of just the number itself:\n\n\\[\n73 = 73\n\\]"

      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, 73 is a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nTo see if a number is prime we only need to test divisibility by prime numbers up to its square\u2011root.  \n\\[\n\\sqrt{73}\\approx 8.5\n\\]\n\nThe primes less than\u202f8.5 are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- 73 is odd, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- The sum of its digits is \\(7+3 = 10\\), which is not a multiple of\u202f3, so 73 isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f3.  \n- It doesn\u2019t end in 0 or\u202f5, so it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f5.  \n- Dividing by\u202f7 gives \\(73 \u00f7 7 \u2248 10.43\\), not an integer, so 73 isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f7.\n\nSince none of these possible factors divide 73, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is prime."

      "student_answer": "I think the only positive divisors of\u202f73\u202fare\u202f1\u202fand\u202f73 itself, since\u202f73\u202fis a prime number."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "The number 73 is **odd**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be written as \\(2k\\) for some integer \\(k\\); otherwise it is odd. When we divide 73 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n73 \\div 2 = 36 \\text{ remainder } 1\n\\]\n\nSince there is a remainder of\u202f1, 73 cannot be expressed as a multiple of\u202f2, so it is not even. Therefore, 73 is an odd number."
