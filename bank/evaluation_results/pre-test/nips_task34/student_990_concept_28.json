      "student_answer": "No, 171 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by\u202f3 (since 1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9, which is a multiple of\u202f3), giving  \n\n\\[\n171 \u00f7 3 = 57,\n\\]\n\nand 57 itself is \\(3 \u00d7 19\\). So the full factorisation is  \n\n\\[\n171 = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 19.\n\\]\n\nBecause it has divisors other than 1 and itself, 171 is composite, not prime."

      "student_answer": "I think\u202f171\u202fis divisible by both\u202f9\u202fand\u202f19.\n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f9:** The sum of the digits of\u202f171\u202fis\u202f1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9, and 9 is a multiple of\u202f9. So\u202f171\u202fis divisible by\u202f9 (indeed,\u202f171\u202f\u00f7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f19).\n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f19:** If you multiply\u202f19\u202fby\u202f9\u202fyou get\u202f19\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f171. So\u202f171\u202f\u00f7\u202f19\u202f=\u202f9, which is an integer. Hence\u202f171\u202fis also divisible by\u202f19.\n\nSince\u202f171\u202f=\u202f9\u202f\u00d7\u202f19, it is divisible by both numbers."
