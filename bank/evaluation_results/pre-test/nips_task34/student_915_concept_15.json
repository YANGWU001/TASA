      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes,\u202f73 is a prime number.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To check whether 73 is prime, we only need to test divisibility by primes less than or equal to \u221a73 \u2248\u202f8.5. The relevant primes are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- **2:** 73 is odd \u2192 not divisible by 2.  \n- **3:** 7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10; 10 is not a multiple of 3 \u2192 73 is not divisible by 3.  \n- **5:** Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5; 73 ends in 3 \u2192 not divisible by 5.  \n- **7:** 70\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f10, leaving a remainder of 3 \u2192 73 is not divisible by 7.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 73, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is a prime number."

      "student_answer": "Yes, it is possible.  \nSince 73 is odd, one of the primes must be 2.  \n\n\\(73 - 2 = 71\\), and 71 is also a prime number.  \n\nSo  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{73 = 2 + 71}\n\\]"

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an **odd** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder (i.e., it is a multiple of\u202f2). When we divide 73 by\u202f2 we get:\n\n\\[\n73 \\div 2 = 36\\text{ remainder }1\n\\]\n\nSince there is a remainder of\u202f1, 73 is not divisible by\u202f2, so it is not even. Therefore, it is odd."
