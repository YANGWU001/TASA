  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of basic arithmetic operations and number representations. However, there was a mistake in the Roman numeral representation of 70, which should be 'LXX' but is typically represented as 'LXX' or 'LXX' in some contexts. Additionally, the rounding question was incorrect; 70 rounds to 100, not because it is closer, but because it is equidistant from both 0 and 100, typically rounding up. Overall, the student shows good comprehension with minor errors in specific areas.",
