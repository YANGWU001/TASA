      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014**in Euclidean (flat\u2011plane) geometry the interior angles of any triangle always add up to\u202f180\u00b0.**  \n\nThis result follows from the parallel\u2011postulate: if you extend one side of the triangle and draw a line through the opposite vertex parallel to that side, the two exterior angles formed are congruent to the interior angles at the other two vertices, and the three interior angles together make a straight line, which measures 180\u00b0.\n\n---\n\n**But** the statement is not universal across all kinds of geometry:\n\n| Geometry type | Sum of interior angles of a triangle |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Euclidean (flat)** | **Exactly 180\u00b0** |\n| **Spherical** | **Greater than 180\u00b0** (the excess equals the area of the triangle on the sphere) |\n| **Hyperbolic** | **Less than 180\u00b0** (the deficit is related to the triangle\u2019s area) |\n\nSo, the \u201calways true\u201d claim holds only for triangles drawn on a flat surface (Euclidean plane). In curved spaces\u2014such as the surface of a sphere or a hyperbolic plane\u2014the sum can be more or less than 180\u00b0, respectively."
