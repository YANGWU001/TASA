When we divide 220 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n220 \\div 2 = 110\n\\]\n\nSince the result is a whole number (110) and there is no remainder, 220 satisfies the definition of an even number. Therefore, 220 is even."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 220 is **not** a perfect square.\n\n**Justification**\n\nA perfect square is an integer that can be written as \\(n^{2}\\) for some integer \\(n\\).  \nTo test whether 220 is a perfect square, we compare it with the squares of the integers nearest to its square root.\n\n\\[\n14^{2}=196 \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad 15^{2}=225\n\\]\n\nSince  \n\n\\[\n196 \\;<\\; 220 \\;<\\; 225,\n\\]\n\nthe square root of 220 lies between 14 and 15:\n\n\\[\n14 \\;<\\; \\sqrt{220} \\;<\\; 15.\n\\]\n\nBecause there is no integer between 14 and 15, \\(\\sqrt{220}\\) cannot be an integer. Therefore 220 cannot be expressed as \\(n^{2}\\) for any integer \\(n\\).\n\nHence, **220 is not a perfect square**."
