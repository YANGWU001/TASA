      "question": "Explain the significance of the number 212 in scientific measurements.",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f212 is most famous in science as the boiling point of water on the **Fahrenheit temperature scale**. At standard atmospheric pressure (1\u202fatm or 101.3\u202fkPa), pure water changes from liquid to vapor at **212\u202f\u00b0F**, which is exactly **100\u202f\u00b0C** on the Celsius scale.  \n\nBecause of this exact correspondence, 212\u202f\u00b0F is used as a **reference point** for:\n\n* **Calibrating thermometers** and temperature\u2011sensing devices that are marked in degrees Fahrenheit.  \n* **Converting** between Fahrenheit and Celsius (the formula\u202f\u00b0F\u202f=\u202f(9\u20445)\u00b7\u00b0C\u202f+\u202f32 gives 212\u202f\u00b0F when \u00b0C\u202f=\u202f100).  \n* **Thermodynamic calculations** that involve the phase change of water, such as determining latent heat or designing equipment that operates near the boiling point (e.g., steam generators, heat exchangers).  \n\nIn short, 212\u202f\u00b0F serves as a fundamental benchmark in scientific measurements involving temperature, especially when the Fahrenheit scale is used."

      "question": "How is the number 212 related to the concept of energy and transformation?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f212 is most commonly recognized as **212\u202f\u00b0F**, which is the temperature at which **water boils** at standard atmospheric pressure.  \n\n- **Energy:** To raise water from a lower temperature to 212\u202f\u00b0F you must add heat energy. At the boiling point the added energy goes into breaking the intermolecular bonds that hold the water molecules together in the liquid state.\n- **Transformation (Phase Change):** When water reaches 212\u202f\u00b0F it undergoes a **phase transformation** from liquid to vapor (steam). This is a classic example of an energy\u2011driven transformation: the same substance changes its physical state because enough energy has been supplied.  \n\nBecause 212\u202f\u00b0F corresponds to **100\u202f\u00b0C**, it also serves as a convenient link between the two temperature scales used in science and everyday life, further emphasizing its role in describing energy (heat) and the transformation of matter."

      "question": "Why is 212\u00b0F considered an important milestone in thermodynamics?",
      "student_answer": "212\u202f\u00b0F is the temperature at which water boils at standard atmospheric pressure (sea\u2011level pressure, about 1\u202fatm). In thermodynamics this point marks a classic phase\u2011change milestone: it is the temperature where liquid water turns into water vapor without a change in temperature, illustrating the concepts of latent heat, vapor pressure, and the relationship between temperature, pressure, and phase equilibria. Because the boiling point is a well\u2011defined, easily reproduced reference, it serves as a convenient benchmark for calibrating thermometers, for defining the Fahrenheit temperature scale, and for teaching fundamental ideas such as energy transfer during a phase transition and the effect of pressure on boiling temperature."

      "question": "Describe a real-world example where the temperature of 212\u00b0F is relevant.",
      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011world situation where\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F is directly relevant is when water reaches its boiling point at sea level. For example, when you heat a pot of water on the stove to cook pasta, the water must be heated to\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F (100\u202f\u00b0C). At this temperature the water rapidly turns to steam, providing the high heat needed to soften the pasta quickly and evenly. This same boiling point is also used in other everyday tasks such as sterilizing medical equipment, brewing tea or coffee, and preparing soups, all of which rely on water hitting\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F to ensure proper cooking or sanitation."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "What happens to water molecules at 212\u00b0F that leads to a change in state?",
      "student_answer": "At 212\u202f\u00b0F (100\u202f\u00b0C) water reaches its boiling point. The heat energy causes the water molecules to move much faster, increasing their kinetic energy. When the molecules have enough energy to overcome the attractive hydrogen\u2011bond forces that hold them together in the liquid, they break free from one another and escape into the surrounding space as water vapor. In other words, the rapid motion of the molecules lets them change from the liquid state to the gaseous state (steam)."
