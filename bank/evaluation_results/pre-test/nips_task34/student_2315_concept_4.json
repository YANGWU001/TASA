  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of basic mathematical concepts. They struggled with prime factorization, even/odd classification, addition, division, squaring, and greatest common divisor. However, they correctly identified the square root range and binary conversion, showing some grasp of those topics. More practice and confidence in fundamental operations are needed.",
