      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think it\u2019s not always true. I guess the angles of a triangle only add up to 180 degrees in some special cases, like maybe only for right\u2011angled triangles or something like that. So, I\u2019d say the statement is false."

      "question": "How many degrees are in a semicircle?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a semicircle is half of a full circle, so maybe it\u2019s **90 degrees**? I'm not really sure."

      "question": "If you rotate an object 180 degrees, what happens to its orientation?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think if you rotate something by 180\u202fdegrees, it ends up looking the same as before, like its orientation doesn\u2019t really change. I'm not totally sure, though."
