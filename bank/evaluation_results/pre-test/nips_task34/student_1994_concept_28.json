      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 171 might actually be a prime number. I tried dividing it by a few small numbers \u2013 it\u2019s not even, so not divisible by\u202f2, and when I tried 3 I got a weird decimal, so I guessed it doesn\u2019t divide evenly. It also isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f5 or\u202f7, so I guess there\u2019s no factor other than 1 and itself. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s why I\u2019d say 171 is prime."

It doesn\u2019t come out to a nice whole number, so I guess 19 doesn\u2019t go into 171 evenly.  \n\nSo, I\u2019d say 171 is probably not divisible by both 9 and 19.
