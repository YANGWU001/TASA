      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014**in ordinary (Euclidean) geometry the three interior angles of any triangle always add up to\u202f180\u00b0.**  \n\nHowever, that statement is specific to the flat, two\u2011dimensional plane. In other kinds of geometry the sum can be different:\n\n* **Spherical geometry** (the surface of a sphere): the angle sum is **greater than\u202f180\u00b0**.  \n* **Hyperbolic geometry** (a \u201csaddle\u2011shaped\u201d space): the angle sum is **less than\u202f180\u00b0**.\n\nSo the rule \u201cthe angles of a triangle sum to 180\u00b0\u201d is always true **as long as the triangle is drawn on a flat Euclidean plane**; it does not hold in non\u2011Euclidean settings."
