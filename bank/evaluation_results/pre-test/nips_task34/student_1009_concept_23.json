Maybe it\u2019s the page number where the main example is explained, or possibly it\u2019s the label of a specific figure or diagram that illustrates the key idea. It could also be a year or a model number that the author uses to anchor the discussion. Honestly, I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on the details\u2014my guess is that 406 is just a marker that points you to the part of the text where the main concept is highlighted."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but maybe 406 could be thought of like a point on a map? Like maybe it\u2019s the\u202fx\u2011coordinate\u202f4 and the\u202fy\u2011coordinate\u202f06, so the point (4,\u202f6). Or maybe it\u2019s a street address\u2014like \u201c406 Main Street\u201d could be a building number in a city, so you\u2019d interpret it as a location where someone lives or works. Honestly, I\u2019m a bit confused, but I guess those are the kinds of practical ways you might think about the number\u202f406."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 406 shows up in a few everyday places.\u202fFor example, \u2026  \n\n- There\u2019s a **Route\u202f406** (a highway) in a few states\u2014like the one that runs through New\u202fZealand or a short state road in the U.S.  \n- Some hotels or apartment buildings have a **room\u202f406** on the fourth floor, so you might see \u201c406\u201d on a door sign.  \n- Also, **406** is the **area code for Montana**, so you\u2019ll see it on phone numbers from that state.  \n\nThose are the kinds of things I remember where the number 406 is \u201capplied\u201d or observed."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the \u201cconcept of\u202f406\u201d is something you\u2019d run into when you\u2019re trying to figure out where to park a car in a garage. Like, if a building has a level\u202f4 and a spot\u202f06, that combination\u202f406 tells you the exact parking space you need. So if you\u2019re a delivery driver and you need to drop off a package, you have to know the 406 spot so you don\u2019t block the hallway. It\u2019s pretty important for making sure the truck fits and you don\u2019t get stuck. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess understanding 406 helps you avoid traffic jams inside the garage."

      "question": "How could 406 be misinterpreted, and what are the consequences of such a misunderstanding?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 406 could be misread in a few ways. One way is that people might think it\u2019s a **temperature** \u2013 like \u201c406\u202f\u00b0F\u201d \u2013 instead of a code, so they might get confused about whether it\u2019s a number in a math problem or an actual heat reading. Another mix\u2011up is reading it as **\u201c40\u20116\u201d** (forty\u2011six) instead of \u201cfour\u2011zero\u2011six,\u201d which could lead someone to use the wrong value in a calculation.\n\nIf you misunderstand it like that, the consequences could be \u2026 well, you might end up plugging the wrong number into an equation, which would give you the wrong answer. In a real\u2011world setting, if a teacher or a program expects the exact number 406 and you write 46 instead, the whole solution could be marked wrong. Also, if it\u2019s a code (like an HTTP status code) and you think it\u2019s a temperature, you might mis\u2011diagnose a web\u2011page problem as a heating issue, which would obviously lead to \u201cfunny\u201d troubleshooting steps. \n\nSo, basically, mixing up the digits or the meaning can cause errors in calculations or misunderstandings about what the number is supposed to represent."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Compare 406 to similar concepts or numbers and explain any differences or similarities.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I guess 406 is kind of like 400 and 500 because they\u2019re all three\u2011digit numbers, right? So one similarity is that they\u2019re all in the hundreds place, which means they\u2019re kind of the same size. But 406 is different from 400 because 406 has a \u201c6\u201d at the end instead of a \u201c0,\u201d so it\u2019s a little bit bigger than 400\u2014like, it\u2019s 6 more.  \n\nCompared to 405, I think 406 is\u2026 actually, I\u2019m not sure\u2014maybe it\u2019s just one more than 405, so it\u2019s pretty much the same but just one unit higher.  \n\nIf you look at 406 and 407, they\u2019re also close, but 407 has a \u201c7\u201d at the end, so that makes it a bit bigger than 406.  \n\nSometimes people compare 406 to numbers like 4060 or 40600, but those have extra zeros at the end, so they\u2019re ten or a hundred times bigger, respectively.  \n\nSo, I guess the main thing is that 406 shares the same hundreds digit (4) with numbers like 401, 402, \u2026 409, but the last digit changes the exact value.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure what else to say\u2026 maybe that 406 is an even number because it ends in 6, while 405 is odd? Yeah, that\u2019s probably a difference, too."
