      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the \u201c221\u201d thing is just a prime number they\u2019re talking about. It\u2019s kind of a special number they use, like a prime that shows up in the examples. I'm not really sure, though."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f221 is kind of a \u201creal\u2011world\u201d thing because it shows up in a lot of everyday codes.\u202fFor example, some stores use 221 as a product\u2011category number, and I\u2019ve seen it on a few barcode prefixes.\u202fAlso, I heard that some phone\u2011area\u2011codes in a few small towns start with 221, so it\u2019s used in telecommunications.\u202fSo basically, 221 is just a convenient little identifier that people use for labeling things\u2014like inventory numbers or regional codes."

      "question": "Can you explain the significance of '221' in relation to other similar concepts?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f221 is kind of special because it\u2019s\u2026 well, I guess it\u2019s a prime like 223 or 229. Maybe it\u2019s one of those \u201codd\u201d primes that shows up in a lot of patterns? I think it doesn\u2019t have any factors besides 1 and itself, so it\u2019s kind of like 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7\u2026 those little prime numbers.  \n\nIf I remember right, sometimes people use 221 when they\u2019re talking about \u201cspecial\u201d numbers that are close to squares or something, but I don\u2019t really know the exact rule. I guess it might be related to the idea of \u201cprime twins\u201d or maybe \u201ccousin primes,\u201d but I\u2019m not sure how exactly.  \n\nSo, um\u2026 the significance of 221 is probably that it\u2019s a prime number that shows up in the same group as other primes, kind of like a \u201cfriend\u201d of 223. I think that\u2019s about it."

      "question": "What are the key characteristics or features of '221'?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f221\u202fhas a few simple traits.  For one, it\u2019s an odd number and\u2014if I\u2019m not mixing things up\u2014it\u2019s actually a prime number, so it would only be divisible by\u202f1\u202fand\u202fitself.  It\u2019s also a three\u2011digit number that kind of looks the same forwards and backwards, so maybe it\u2019s a palindrome too.  Besides that, I don\u2019t recall any special factor\u2011related facts about it.  (I\u2019m not really sure about any of this.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one way to use the number\u202f221 in a real\u2011world situation is as a \u201cprime\u201d number for a simple encryption key. For example, if you were making a tiny RSA\u2011style code you could pick 221 as your modulus and then choose some small exponents to encrypt a message.\u202f(It\u2019s just a quick example of how a number like 221 might show up in practice.)"

      "student_answer": "Um... I think the number\u202f221 is kind of a big deal because it\u2019s actually a prime number, right?\u202fIt shows up a lot in cryptography and security stuff\u2014like it\u2019s used as one of those special primes for encryption algorithms. So, if you understand 221, you\u2019re basically getting the basics of how those codes work and why some messages stay secret. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s why I heard it\u2019s important in its field."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What challenges or limitations are associated with the concept '221'?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the main problem with \u201c221\u201d is that it\u2019s a prime number, so you can\u2019t break it down any further. Because it can\u2019t be factored into smaller whole\u2011number pieces, it\u2019s kind of limited \u2013 you can\u2019t use it for things like finding prime factors or building simpler multiples. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember about the difficulties with 221."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 221 could be important in a situation like a secret code for a spy movie.\u202fFor example, maybe the agents have to meet at \u201c221\u202fBaker\u202fStreet\u201d and that address is the critical clue that tells them where the hidden safe is.\u202fI guess the number 221 is the code they need to unlock the door, so without it the whole mission would fail.  \n\nSorry if that doesn\u2019t sound right \u2013 I\u2019m kind of guessing here."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What are the potential outcomes of misinterpreting the concept '221'?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if you misread or mis\u2011interpret the number\u202f221, a few things could go wrong.  \n\n- First, you might **think it\u2019s a prime number** when it\u2019s actually not (it\u2019s 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17). That could lead you to pick the wrong prime factors for a problem or to miss a simplification step.  \n- Second, you could **use the wrong divisibility rules** \u2013 for example, you might try to divide by 2 or 3 because you think it\u2019s even or a multiple of 3, which would waste time and give you a wrong answer.  \n- Third, in a real\u2011world context like cryptography or coding, treating 221 as prime could make a key\u2011generation step insecure or cause an algorithm to fail.  \n- Finally, you might **mis\u2011apply formulas** that assume a number is prime (like using\u202fp\u202f\u2013\u202f1 in Euler\u2019s theorem) and end up with an incorrect result.  \n\nSo, basically, mixing up whether 221 is prime or composite can mess up factorization, divisor checks, and any later calculations that rely on the correct prime\u2011factor information."
