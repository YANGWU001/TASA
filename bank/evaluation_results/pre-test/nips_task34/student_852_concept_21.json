      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f183 shows up in a few places.  \n\nIn mathematics, I remember hearing that\u202f183\u202fis a \u201cspecial\u201d number because it can be written as\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61, and\u202f61\u202fis a prime, so maybe it\u2019s a product of a small prime and a larger prime.  I also think it might be a triangular number \u2013 like the 19th triangular number or something \u2013 but I could be mixing that up with 190.  \n\nHistorically, I think\u202f183\u202fis a year that was kind of important in the Roman Empire.  I recall that in\u202fAD\u202f183\u202fthe emperor\u202fCommodus\u202fwas ruling (or maybe it was\u202fMarcus Aurelius\u202f\u2013 I\u2019m not sure which one).  There might have also been some battle in\u202f183\u202fBCE in ancient China, but the details escape me.  \n\nSo, the significance is probably that it\u2019s a product of two primes and it shows up as a year in Roman history, even though I\u2019m not entirely confident about the exact events."
