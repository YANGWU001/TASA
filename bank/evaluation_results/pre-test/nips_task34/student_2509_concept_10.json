      "question": "Explain how the concept of 251 relates to other numerical concepts.",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f251 is an odd integer, so it shares the basic property of not being divisible by\u202f2 with all other odd numbers.  It is also a prime number \u2013 its only positive divisors are\u202f1 and\u202f251 \u2013 which connects it to the whole class of prime numbers that are used in things like prime\u2011factorization and cryptography.  \n\nBecause 251 is close to 250, it is sometimes thought of as \u201cone more than a multiple of\u202f5\u201d (since\u202f250\u202f=\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f50), so it can be related to the concept of \u201cnumbers that are one away from a round multiple.\u201d  In fact, 251 can be written as 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f50\u202f+\u202f1, which is a simple example of a number of the form\u202fkn\u202f+\u202f1.  \n\nSome people also point out that 251 appears in the sequence of \u201ccentered square numbers\u2019\u2019 (numbers that can be arranged in a square with a dot in the middle), but that is actually not correct \u2013 the centered square numbers go 1,\u202f5,\u202f13,\u202f25,\u202f41\u2026, so 251 is not one of them.  (I think maybe I\u2019m mixing it up with a different sequence.)  \n\nAnother way to relate 251 to other numbers is to notice that it is a palindrome in base\u202f10 when you write it backwards (152 is not the same, so actually it is **not** a palindrome \u2013 I\u2019m getting confused).  However, in base\u202f2, 251 is\u202f11111011, which does have a symmetrical pattern of ones and zeros, so you could say it has some \u201cbinary\u2011palindrome\u2011like\u201d qualities.  \n\nFinally, 251 is sometimes mentioned in connection with the Fibonacci numbers because it is close to the 12th Fibonacci number\u202f144 and the 13th\u202f233, but it is not itself a Fibonacci number.  So while 251 shares some properties with primes, odd numbers, and numbers that are one more than a multiple of\u202f5, it does **not** belong to the Fibonacci or centered\u2011square families."

      "question": "What mathematical properties are associated with the number 251?",
      "student_answer": "Here are some mathematical facts that I can think of about the number\u202f251:\n\n1. **Prime number** \u2013\u202f251 has no positive divisors other than\u202f1 and\u202f251, so it is a prime.  \n\n2. **Sophie\u202fGermain prime** \u2013\u202fIf you double 251 and add\u202f1 you get\u202f503, which is also prime, so 251 is a Sophie\u202fGermain prime.  \n\n3. **Not a twin prime** \u2013\u202fThe numbers\u202f249\u202fand\u202f253 are not prime, so 251 is not part of a twin\u2011prime pair.  \n\n4. **Probably a palindrome in base\u201110** \u2013\u202fI think 251 reads the same backward and forward, but actually that\u2019s not true; it\u2019s not a palindrome.  \n\n5. **Sum of two squares** \u2013\u202fI believe 251 can be written as a sum of two perfect squares, but because 251 \u2261\u202f3\u202f(mod\u202f4) it cannot be expressed that way, so this statement is false.  \n\n6. **Centered hexagonal number** \u2013\u202fI suspect 251 might appear in the centered\u2011hexagonal sequence, but the known centered\u2011hexagonal numbers are 1,\u202f7,\u202f19,\u202f37,\u202f61,\u202f91,\u202f127,\u202f169,\u202f217,\u202f271\u2026 so 251 is not one of them.  \n\n7. **Divisible by 251 itself** \u2013\u202fObviously 251 \u00f7\u202f251\u202f=\u202f1, so the only non\u2011trivial divisor is the number itself.  \n\n8. **Probably a perfect square** \u2013\u202fIt looks like it could be a square, but the square root of\u202f251 is about\u202f15.84, so it\u2019s not a perfect square.  \n\nSo, in short, 251 is a prime (and a Sophie\u202fGermain prime) but it is not a twin prime, palindrome, sum of two squares, centered\u2011hexagonal number, or a perfect square."

      "question": "Is 251 a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "I think 251 is **not** a prime number.  \nIt looks like it can be divided by\u202f11, because  \n\n\\[\n251 \\div 11 \\approx 22.8,\n\\]\n\nso 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f22\u202f=\u202f242 and the remainder would be 9.  That suggests 251 isn\u2019t prime\u2014it has a factor around 11 (probably 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f23 would give 253, so the factor must be close to that).  \n\nProbably the exact factor is 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f23\u202f=\u202f253, and since 251 is just a little less than 253, it must share a divisor with it. So 251 is not prime. (I\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s my best guess.)"

      "question": "Describe a scenario in which understanding the concept of 251 would be important.",
      "student_answer": "Understanding the number\u202f251 can be useful in a few real\u2011world situations.  \n\nOne realistic scenario is **cryptography**.  Many encryption algorithms (like RSA) rely on large prime numbers to generate secure keys.  If you\u2019re choosing a small \u201ctoy\u2011example\u201d key for a classroom demonstration, you might pick 251 because it\u2019s a three\u2011digit prime.  Knowing that it cannot be factored into smaller whole numbers (other than 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f251) means you can safely use it as a base for modular arithmetic in the example, which helps illustrate why prime numbers make good building blocks for public\u2011key encryption.  \n\nAnother (though less technical) situation could be **inventory coding**.  Suppose a warehouse labels its bins with three\u2011digit numbers and you need to locate the bin that holds a special item.  If the bin number is 251, it\u2019s helpful to remember that 251 is odd and, as far as I recall, it\u2019s also a prime number, so you won\u2019t accidentally group it with a range of even\u2011numbered bins (like 250, 252, etc.).  This can make the searching process a bit quicker.  \n\n*I think* that 251 is also divisible by 13, which would be important if you were trying to split a shipment evenly among 13 trucks \u2013 but now I\u2019m not completely sure about that last part.  (If it were divisible, you could load each truck with exactly the same number of items, but I might be mixing up the factors.)"

      "student_answer": "The number\u202f251 is a prime number, so it can be useful whenever you need a \u201cnice\u201d whole\u2011number factor that won\u2019t break down into smaller integer pieces.  \n\nOne common way to use it is as a coefficient in a linear\u2011algebra problem \u2013 for example, you might see an equation like\u202f\\(251x+7=0\\) and solve for\u202f\\(x\\) by dividing both sides by\u202f251.  \n\nBecause it\u2019s relatively large, 251 is also sometimes chosen as a modulus in simple modular\u2011arithmetic puzzles; the fact that it has no non\u2011trivial divisors makes the \u201cwrap\u2011around\u201d behavior a bit less predictable, which can be handy in cryptographic\u2011type examples.  \n\nIn geometry, you could treat 251 as a length unit (say 251\u202fcm) and use it to create scale models; the fact that it\u2019s odd doesn\u2019t really matter, but it does give you a concrete number to work with when you\u2019re converting between real\u2011world and drawing sizes.  \n\nFinally, in some word\u2011problems you might see a story\u2011telling situation where a store sells 251 items per day \u2013 the exact number isn\u2019t special, it\u2019s just a realistic figure that forces you to do division or percentages rather than simple rounding.  \n\n(So, overall, 251 can pop up as a prime coefficient, a modulus, a measurement, or just a realistic count, depending on the context.)"
