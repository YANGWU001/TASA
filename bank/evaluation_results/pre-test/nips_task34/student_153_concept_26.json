  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime factorization, digit summation, binary conversion, square roots, divisibility rules, and counting whole numbers. However, they incorrectly identified 209 as a prime number and made an error in expressing factors greater than 10. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concepts related to the number 209.",

      "student_answer": "I think\u202f209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nOne quick way to test divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits:  \n\n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\).  \n\nSince\u202f11 is not a multiple of\u202f3, the original number (209) can\u2019t be divided evenly by\u202f3.  \nSo the answer is no \u2013 209 is not divisible by\u202f3."
