  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of basic concepts related to the number 184, but there are significant inaccuracies in several answers. They correctly identified the divisors and the sum of the digits, as well as the Roman numeral conversion, but struggled with prime factorization, binary representation, and the classification of even and odd numbers. The student should review these concepts for better accuracy.",

Maybe it\u2019s one of those \u201cnice\u201d numbers that shows up in some formulas, like it\u2019s the product of a small prime and a larger one\u2014like 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f23? But I think the main point is that it\u2019s a prime, so it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. \n\nI guess that\u2019s the significance\u2026?"

That would make it odd, right?  \n\n(\u2026but I could be mixing things up.)"
