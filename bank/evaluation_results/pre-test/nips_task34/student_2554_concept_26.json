  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including its prime factorization, divisibility rules, and basic arithmetic operations. However, the answer to Question 5 is incorrect as it does not express 209 as a product of two factors with one greater than 10. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should pay closer attention to the specific requirements of questions.",

      "student_answer": "No, 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.  \nTo test 209, we can try dividing it by prime numbers up to \u221a209 (\u2248\u202f14.5).\n\n- 209 \u00f7 2 \u2192 not an integer (209 is odd)  \n- 209 \u00f7 3 \u2192 69.666\u2026 (not an integer)  \n- 209 \u00f7 5 \u2192 ends in 9, not divisible by 5  \n- 209 \u00f7 7 \u2192 29.857\u2026 (not an integer)  \n- 209 \u00f7 11 \u2192 **19** (exactly)\n\nSince 209 = 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f19, it has divisors 1, 11, 19, and 209. Because it has more than two divisors, it is **composite**, not prime."
