      "question": "What is the significance of the number 183 in mathematics or history?",
      "student_answer": "The only thing special about **183** that I can think of is that it\u2019s just an ordinary integer with a couple of modest \u201cfacts\u201d attached to it.\n\n**In mathematics**  \n-\u202f183 is a composite number: it factors as\u202f\\(183 = 3 \\times 61\\).  \n-\u202fBecause the sum of its proper divisors (\u202f1\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f61\u202f=\u202f65\u202f) is smaller than 183, it is a **deficient** number.  \n-\u202fIt isn\u2019t a square, a triangular number, a prime or a Harshad (Niven) number, so there isn\u2019t any famous formula that singles it out.\n\n**In history**  \n-\u202fThe year **AD\u202f183** (or 183\u202fCE) was a year in the Roman Empire.  Around that time the emperor\u202fCommodus was still on the throne (he ruled from\u202f180\u202fto\u202f192), and several provincial uprisings and military campaigns were happening, but there isn\u2019t a single widely\u2011known event that is usually identified as \u201cthe year\u202f183\u201d.  \n-\u202fLikewise, **183\u202fBCE** falls in the Hellenistic period after Alexander the Great; again, no single landmark event is commonly attached to that specific year.\n\nSo, apart from being the product\u202f\\(3 \\times 61\\) and a relatively unremarkable year in the ancient calendar, 183 doesn\u2019t have a famous mathematical theorem or a celebrated historical milestone associated with it. (At least, that\u2019s what I think.)"

      "student_answer": "No, 183 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nA quick way to check is to use the divisibility rule for\u202f3: add the digits of the number.  \n\n\\(1 + 8 + 3 = 12\\), and 12 is divisible by\u202f3, so 183 is also divisible by\u202f3.\n\nIndeed,\n\\[\n183 \\div 3 = 61,\n\\]\nso 183 = \\(3 \\times 61\\). Since it has factors other than 1 and itself, it is a composite number, not a prime."
