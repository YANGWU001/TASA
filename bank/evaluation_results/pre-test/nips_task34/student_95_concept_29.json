      "student_answer": "**Answer:**  \nIn ordinary (Euclidean) plane geometry the statement is always true: the three interior angles of any triangle sum to exactly\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nHowever, in non\u2011Euclidean geometries the rule can change:  \n\n* On a sphere (spherical geometry) the angle sum is **greater** than\u202f180\u00b0.  \n* In hyperbolic geometry the angle sum is **less** than\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nSo the \u201c180\u00b0\u201d rule holds universally only for triangles drawn on a flat (Euclidean) surface."

If the object has 180\u00b0 rotational symmetry it will look the same after the turn, but its orientation has still been flipped."
