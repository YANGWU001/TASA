Maybe it means you have 406 dollars in your wallet, or you need to buy 406 pieces of inventory. In other words, I\u2019d just treat it as a count of 406 items\u2014like \u201cwe have 406 of those things\u201d \u2013 and use that number directly in whatever calculation you\u2019re doing."

(I\u2019ve also heard someone mention\u202f406\u202fas a room number in a building, but that\u2019s probably not what you\u2019re looking for.)"

      "question": "Describe a situation where understanding the concept of 406 is crucial.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the concept of 406 is something you run into when you\u2019re dealing with web pages that refuse to show you something because the server can\u2019t find a format you accept. So, for example, if you\u2019re building a website and a user\u2019s browser only supports JPEG images but the server only has PNGs, the server might send a **406 Not\u202fAcceptable** response. In that situation it\u2019s crucial to understand what a 406 means so you can either change the content\u2011type you\u2019re requesting or adjust the server to provide a format the client can handle. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s one place where knowing \u201c406\u201d would matter."

So the number before 406 would be\u202f396, and the next one after it would be\u202f416.  \n\n(Just a guess\u2026 could be wrong.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How could 406 be misinterpreted, and what are the consequences of such a misunderstanding?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 the \u201c406\u201d status can be taken the wrong way in a few different ways.  \n\n- Some people think 406 means \u201cNot Found\u201d (like a 404), so they assume the whole resource is missing instead of just the server saying it can\u2019t give you a representation it likes.  \n- Others mix it up with a \u201c400 Bad Request\u201d and believe the client sent totally bad data, when really it\u2019s a content\u2011negotiation problem.  \n- A few folks even treat 406 as if it were a server\u2011error code (like 500) and think the server is broken or overloaded.  \n\nBecause of those mix\u2011ups, the consequences can be\u2026 well, kind of confusing:  \n\n- If you think it\u2019s a 404, you might delete or stop trying to request the resource even though a different format could be served.  \n- If you treat it like a 400, you might keep sending the same request and never change the \u201cAccept\u201d header, so the client just keeps getting the same error.  \n- If you believe it\u2019s a 500\u2011type problem, you might restart the server or blame the network, which won\u2019t fix the real issue of mismatched MIME types.  \n\nSo, basically, misreading a 406 can lead to wrong debugging steps, unnecessary code changes, or even abandoning a resource that could have been delivered if the client simply asked for a format the server supports."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Compare 406 to similar concepts or numbers and explain any differences or similarities.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 406 is kind of like other three\u2011digit numbers that end in 6, like 216 or 506, because they all end with the digit 6.  So they\u2019re all even, right?  That means they\u2019re all divisible by 2, which is a similarity.  But I guess 406 is different from numbers like 405 because 405 ends in a 5, so it\u2019s odd\u2026 or maybe it\u2019s just not divisible by 2?  I\u2019m not sure.\n\nAlso, I think 406 might be a prime number\u2026 or maybe it isn\u2019t?  I remember primes are numbers that can\u2019t be divided by anything except 1 and themselves, and 406 seems\u2026 kind of special?  Maybe it\u2019s like 401, which is prime, but 406 has a 0 in the middle, so it\u2019s not the same.\n\nAnother thing\u2026 406 is close to 400, which is a round square number (20\u00b2).  So 406 is just a little bigger than a perfect square, while 400 is exactly a perfect square.  That\u2019s a difference.\n\nI guess compared to 408, which is also even, 408 is divisible by 3 because 4+0+8 = 12, which is a multiple of 3, but 406\u2019s digits add up to 10, so it\u2019s not divisible by 3.  That\u2019s another similarity (both even) and a difference (one is divisible by 3, the other isn\u2019t).  \n\nSo, um, those are the things I can think of\u2026 maybe I\u2019m missing some other similarities or differences."
