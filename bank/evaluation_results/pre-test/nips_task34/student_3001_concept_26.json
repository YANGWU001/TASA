  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, basic arithmetic, and properties of numbers. However, there was a misunderstanding regarding divisibility by 3, leading to an incorrect conclusion. Additionally, the binary conversion was incorrect. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should double-check calculations and reasoning in some areas.",

      "student_answer": "I think the number\u202f209\u202fis divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nOne quick way to check is to add the digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11. Since 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3, I\u2019m not completely sure, but I\u2019m guessing that sometimes numbers whose digit\u2011sum is close to a multiple of\u202f3 can still be divisible, so 209 might be divisible by\u202f3.  \n\n(So, my answer is that 209 is divisible by\u202f3.)"
