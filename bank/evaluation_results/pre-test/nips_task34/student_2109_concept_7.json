      "question": "Explain the significance of the number 212 in scientific measurements.",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f212 is most often seen in science as\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F \u2013 the temperature at which pure water boils at sea\u2011level pressure (1\u202fatm).  Because the boiling point is a very sharp, reproducible physical change, 212\u202f\u00b0F is used as a reference point when calibrating thermometers and when converting between the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales (212\u202f\u00b0F\u202f=\u202f100\u202f\u00b0C).  \n\nIn many experiments the boiling point serves as a \u201cfixed\u2011point\u201d for checking that temperature\u2011controlled equipment is working correctly, and it also shows up in equations that relate heat, pressure, and phase changes (e.g., the Clausius\u2011Clapeyron relation).  \n\nI think the value is also sometimes mentioned in discussions of atmospheric pressure, because the pressure that gives a boiling point of 212\u202f\u00b0F is about 1\u202fatm; however, the number itself isn\u2019t a pressure value.  \n\nSo, in short, 212\u202f\u00b0F is significant because it marks the standard boiling point of water in the Fahrenheit system and provides a convenient, well\u2011known benchmark for temperature measurement and conversion."

      "question": "How is the number 212 related to the concept of energy and transformation?",
      "student_answer": "I think the number\u202f212 is best known as the temperature\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F, which is the boiling point of water.  At that temperature water absorbs enough energy to change phase\u2014from a liquid to a gas\u2014so it\u2019s a clear example of energy being transferred into a substance and causing a transformation (a phase change).  (In other words, the heat you add raises the water to 212\u202f\u00b0F, and then the water turns into steam.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Why is 212\u00b0F considered an important milestone in thermodynamics?",
      "student_answer": "212\u202f\u00b0F is important in thermodynamics because it\u2019s the temperature at which water **boils** (turns into steam) at normal atmospheric pressure.  In other words, it\u2019s the point where liquid water makes the transition to the gaseous phase, and that phase\u2011change is a classic example of a heat\u2011energy transfer that we study in thermodynamics.  \n\nBecause water is such a common substance, the boiling point became a convenient reference temperature for early scientists.  They used 212\u202f\u00b0F (which is exactly 100\u202f\u00b0C) as a calibration point for Fahrenheit thermometers, and it also shows up in the definition of the Rankine temperature scale (0\u202f\u00b0R = \u2013459.67\u202f\u00b0F, the absolute zero point).  \n\nSo, essentially, 212\u202f\u00b0F marks a key **phase\u2011change milestone** that helped people measure and understand heat, work, and energy transfer in many experiments and real\u2011world applications.  (It\u2019s not the freezing point of water\u2014that\u2019s 32\u202f\u00b0F\u2014but the boiling point, which is why it\u2019s singled out in thermodynamic discussions.)"

      "question": "Describe a real-world example where the temperature of 212\u00b0F is relevant.",
      "student_answer": "I think one everyday situation where you\u2019d see\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F is the boiling point of water at sea level.\u202fFor example, when you\u2019re heating water on the stove to cook pasta or to sterilize equipment, the water reaches about\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F before it turns to steam. (It\u2019s also the temperature you\u2019d hit inside a pressure cooker when the pressure is high enough to raise the boiling point.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "What happens to water molecules at 212\u00b0F that leads to a change in state?",
      "student_answer": "At about\u202f212\u202f\u00b0F (the boiling point of water at sea level), the water molecules gain a lot of kinetic energy. I think they start to move fast enough to break the hydrogen\u2011bond attractions that hold them together in the liquid. When those intermolecular forces are overcome, the molecules can escape into the air as steam, so the water changes from a liquid to a gaseous state."
