  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of some concepts related to the number 191, such as its representation in Roman numerals, its status as a prime number, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there are significant misunderstandings in identifying its prime status, binary conversion, and digit sum. The student should review prime numbers, binary conversion, and basic arithmetic operations for better accuracy.",

      "student_answer": "The number\u202f191 shows up in a few different places in history, although it isn\u2019t tied to one single \u201cbig\u201d event the way, say,\u202f1945\u202for\u202f1066\u202fare.\u202fHere are a handful of the ways it has appeared:\n\n* **191\u202fAD** \u2013 The Roman Empire was in a period of turmoil around this time.\u202fIn\u202f191\u202fthe emperor\u202fCommodus\u202fhad been assassinated a few years earlier (180\u202fAD), and the empire was dealing with the aftermath of his chaotic reign.\u202fIt was also the year that the plague of\u202f191\u202fis thought to have begun, a\u202fsmall\u2011scale outbreak that struck parts of the empire and contributed to the general instability of the late\u202f2nd\u202fcentury.\n\n* **191\u202fBC** \u2013 A more familiar reference is the\u202fBattle of\u202fCynoscephalus\u202f(191\u202fBC) during the\u202fMacedonian Wars, when the Roman\u2011Allied forces clashed with the Macedonian kingdom.\u202fWhile not a decisive battle, it is sometimes mentioned as part of Rome\u2019s gradual expansion into the Hellenistic world.\n\n* **191\u202fprime** \u2013 Mathematically,\u202f191\u202fis a prime number (it has no divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202fitself).\u202fBecause prime numbers have long fascinated mathematicians and scholars,\u202f191\u202fsometimes crops up in historical notes about early number\u2011theory work, especially in medieval Islamic and later European manuscripts that list primes.\n\n* **July\u202f10\u202f(191st day of a common year)** \u2013 In a modern\u2011day \u201chistorical\u2011event\u2011by\u2011day\u201d sense, the\u202f191st\u202fday of a non\u2011leap year falls on July\u202f10.\u202fA few notable events happened on that date, such as the\u202f1979\u202flaunch of the\u202fVoyager\u202f1 spacecraft (though that actually occurred on September\u202f5; I may be mixing up the dates).\u202fBecause of this confusion, it\u2019s easy to see why the\u202f191st\u202fday isn\u2019t an especially famous anniversary.\n\n* **191\u202fin World War\u202fII** \u2013 There was a\u202f191st\u202fInfantry Brigade in the British Army, formed in the later stages of the war.\u202fIt didn\u2019t see major action as a distinct unit, but the number shows up in the order of battle listings for the British Home Forces.\n\n* **Cultural references** \u2013 Some people point to\u202f191\u202fas a \u201cmystical\u201d number in numerology (1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f11, which is sometimes called a master number).\u202fThis isn\u2019t a historical fact, but it does explain why the number appears in a few modern\u2011day New\u2011Age books.\n\nOverall,\u202f191\u202fdoesn\u2019t dominate any single historical narrative, but it pops up in a few scattered places\u2014from ancient Roman events to modern military designations.  (I\u2019m probably mixing up a couple of the exact dates, but those are the main threads that usually come up when people ask about the significance of\u202f191.)"
