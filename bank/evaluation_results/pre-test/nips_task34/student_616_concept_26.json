  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a mistake in Question 5 where the student incorrectly stated that both factors (11 and 19) are greater than 10. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the material with only minor errors.",

      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:**  \nNo, 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nTo determine if a number is prime, we test whether it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. For 209, we only need to check prime divisors up to \u221a209 \u2248\u202f14.5 (i.e., 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13).\n\n- 209 is odd \u2192 not divisible by 2.  \n- The sum of its digits (2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11) is not a multiple of 3 \u2192 not divisible by 3.  \n- It does not end in 0 or 5 \u2192 not divisible by 5.  \n- Dividing by 7 gives 209 \u00f7 7 \u2248\u202f29.86 \u2192 not an integer.  \n- Dividing by 11 gives **209 \u00f7 11 = 19**, which is an integer.\n\nSince 209 can be written as 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f19, it has a divisor other than 1 and itself, so it is **composite**, not prime."
