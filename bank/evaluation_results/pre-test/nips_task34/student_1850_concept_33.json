I tried to check a few small divisors\u2014like 2, 3, and 5\u2014but 245 isn\u2019t even, it doesn\u2019t add up to a multiple of 3, and when I divided by 5 I got a decimal (actually I think I made a mistake there). Since I couldn\u2019t find a whole\u2011number factor right away, maybe it\u2019s prime? I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I got."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 245 can be written as the product of its prime factors like this:\n\n**245\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f7**\n\nSo the primes would be 3, 5, and 7. (I\u2019m a little uncertain about the 3, though.)"
