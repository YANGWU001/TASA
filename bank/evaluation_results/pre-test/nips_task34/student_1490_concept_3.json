      "student_answer": "The number\u202f221 itself isn\u2019t a \u201ctheory\u201d but it is a handy example when we talk about prime numbers and prime\u2011factor ideas, and that makes it useful in a few everyday\u2011type contexts.\n\n**1. Teaching factorisation**  \nBecause 221\u202f=\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17, it is a simple composite number whose only prime factors are both relatively small primes.  Teachers often pick 221 (or similar numbers) for classroom drills:  \n* \u201cIs 221 prime or composite?\u201d \u2013 students quickly see it isn\u2019t prime because it\u2019s odd and not a multiple of 3, 5, or 7, then they test 13 and discover 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17\u202f=\u202f221.  \n* \u201cWrite the prime\u2011factorisation of 221.\u201d \u2013 the answer is 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17.  \n\n**2. Small\u2011scale cryptography demos**  \nIn introductory cryptography lessons, RSA is illustrated with tiny numbers so that the maths can be done by hand. A typical demo might pick two small primes, say 13 and 17, multiply them to get a modulus\u202fn\u202f=\u202f221, then show how a public\u2011key and private\u2011key pair are derived from the factors. Of course, a real RSA key would use far larger primes, but 221 is a concrete \u201ctoy\u2011example\u201d that lets students see the role of prime factors in the algorithm.\n\n**3. Check\u2011digit or simple hash tricks**  \nSometimes simple error\u2011detecting schemes use a fixed modulus to turn a longer number into a short check\u2011digit. A programmer might choose 221 as the modulus just because it\u2019s the product of two primes, which gives a fairly uniform distribution of remainders for random inputs. The idea is that, after dividing a code by 221, the remainder can be stored as a quick verification value.\n\n**4. Puzzles and recreational math**  \nMany puzzle books include a \u201cfind the hidden factor\u201d or \u201cbreak the code\u201d problem that hinges on recognizing that 221 =\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17. Because both factors are prime, the number is a good illustration of the uniqueness of prime factorisation (the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic) in a setting that feels more like a game than a textbook exercise.\n\n**5. Real\u2011world identifiers (just a side note)**  \nOccasionally a number like 221 shows up as a part of an address, zip code, or product model, but those uses have nothing to do with its mathematical properties. They\u2019re just coincidences of numbering schemes.\n\n---\n\nSo, while 221 isn\u2019t a \u201cbig\u2011shot\u201d number in industry, it serves as a concrete, easy\u2011to\u2011handle example whenever we need to demonstrate how prime factors work, how they feed into basic cryptographic ideas, or how a simple modulus can be used for checksums or puzzles."

Both 13 and 17 are prime, so the factorisation is unique. |\n| **Semiprime** | A number that is the product of exactly two (not necessarily distinct) primes. | Because 221\u202f=\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17, it is a **semiprime**. Semiprimes are important in RSA\u2011type cryptography, where the security rests on the difficulty of factoring such products. |\n| **Product of consecutive primes?** | \u201cConsecutive primes\u201d are primes that follow each other with no other prime in between (e.g., 2 and\u202f3, 5 and\u202f7, 11 and\u202f13). | **Incorrect statement**: 13 and\u202f17 are *not* consecutive primes (the prime\u202f13 is followed by\u202f17, but 13\u202f\u2192\u202f17 skips the prime\u202f13\u202f\u2192\u202f17? Actually there is no prime between them, so they *are* consecutive \u2013 sorry, this is a subtle point. In the standard sense, 13 and\u202f17 *are* consecutive because there is no prime 14\u201116. Hence the claim that they are \u201cnon\u2011consecutive\u201d would be a mistake. |\n| **Sum\u2011of\u2011two\u2011squares representation** | A number of the form *a\u00b2\u202f+\u202fb\u00b2* (with integers a,\u202fb). Numbers whose prime factors of the form 4k+3 appear to an even exponent have such a representation. | Since both 13 and\u202f17 are \u2261\u202f1\u202f(mod\u202f4), 221 can be written as **10\u00b2\u202f+\u202f11\u00b2** (100\u202f+\u202f121\u202f=\u202f221). |\n| **Carmichael number?** | A Carmichael number is a composite n that satisfies Fermat\u2019s little theorem for every base a coprime to n (i.e., a\u207f\u207b\u00b9 \u2261\u202f1\u202f(mod\u202fn)). | **221 is *not* a Carmichael number**. The smallest Carmichael numbers are 561, 1105, 1729, etc. |\n| **Pseudoprime to base\u202f2?** | A base\u20112 pseudoprime satisfies 2\u207f\u207b\u00b9\u202f\u2261\u202f1\u202f(mod\u202fn) even though n is composite. | 221 **fails** this test; 2\u00b2\u00b2\u2070\u202fmod\u202f221 \u2260\u202f1, so it is not a base\u20112 pseudoprime. |\n| **Use in puzzles / trivia** | Numbers that are products of two primes often appear in recreational math as \u201ceasy\u2011to\u2011factor\u201d examples. | 221 is a classic illustration when teaching factorisation, because the factors 13 and\u202f17 are both two\u2011digit primes and easy to spot by trial division. |\n\n### Why teachers like to point out 221\n\n1. **Clear factorisation** \u2013 it isn\u2019t too large, yet it isn\u2019t prime, so it forces students to actually try dividing by small primes (2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13 \u2026).  \n2. **Semiprime example** \u2013 it shows a number that sits at the heart of RSA cryptography, illustrating why factoring a product of two large primes is hard.  \n3. **Sum\u2011of\u2011two\u2011squares** \u2013 it gives a concrete instance of the theorem that a number whose prime factors all are 1\u202f(mod\u202f4) can be expressed as a sum of two squares.  \n4. **Common mistake trap** \u2013 some students mistakenly think \u201cany product of two primes is automatically a Carmichael number\u201d or \u201cany semiprime is a pseudoprime\u201d. 221 helps expose those misconceptions.\n\nIn short, **221** serves as a handy, multi\u2011purpose teaching tool: a small semiprime with a neat sum\u2011of\u2011two\u2011squares representation, but **not** a Carmichael or pseudoprime. Its factorisation (13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17) is simple enough to compute by hand, yet it still illustrates several deeper ideas about prime numbers and their role in number theory."

Both 13 and 17 are prime, so the full factorisation is **221\u202f=\u202f13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17**. |\n| **Divisors** | The positive divisors are **1,\u202f13,\u202f17,\u202f221**. |\n| **Sum of divisors** | \u03c3(221)\u202f=\u202f1\u202f+\u202f13\u202f+\u202f17\u202f+\u202f221\u202f=\u202f252. |\n| **Digital sum** | The sum of its digits is 2\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f5. |\n| **Palindromic nature** | Written in base\u201110, 221 reads the same forward and backward, so it is a **palindromic** number. |\n| **Other divisibility clues** | Because the alternating\u2011sum test for 11 gives (2\u202f\u2212\u202f2\u202f+\u202f1)\u202f=\u202f1, 221 is **not** a multiple of\u202f11.

For 223, none of those checks reveal a divisor, confirming its primality.  \n\n### Why the distinction matters  \n\n- **Cryptography** \u2013 Semiprimes like 221 are the building blocks of many public\u2011key systems (e.g., RSA) because factoring them is moderately hard. Pure primes like 223 are used as the modulus or as generators in certain protocols.  \n- **Number\u2011theory problems** \u2013 When asked to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 221 with another number, you must consider its two prime factors; with a prime like 223, the GCD is either 1 or 223 itself.  \n\n---\n\n**A small slip to note:** I mistakenly mentioned earlier that 221 is divisible by\u202f7; actually it isn\u2019t (221\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2248\u202f31.57). The correct divisors are 1,\u202f13,\u202f17, and\u202f221. This illustrates how easy it is to mis\u2011remember a divisor when working quickly with composite numbers."
