  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic arithmetic and number properties, but there are significant errors in the first three questions regarding prime factorization and factors of 210. The student correctly identifies the prime factorization in question 5 and provides accurate answers for questions 6 through 10. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concepts but needs to improve on factorization and identifying factors.",

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes,\u202f210 is divisible by\u202f5.\n\n**Why:** A whole number is divisible by\u202f5 whenever its last digit is\u202f0 or\u202f5.  \nThe number\u202f210 ends in\u202f0, so it meets this rule.\n\nYou can also check by performing the division:\n\n\\[\n210 \\div 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the division results in the whole number\u202f42 with no remainder, 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

      "student_answer": "210 is an even number.  \n\nA number is even if it can be divided by\u202f2 with no remainder.  \nWhen we divide 210 by\u202f2 we get  \n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nwhich is an integer, so there is no remainder. Therefore 210 is even."
