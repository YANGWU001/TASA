I tried to divide it by a few small numbers like\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f5,\u202f6,\u202f7,\u202f8,\u202f9,\u202f10, and none of those seemed to go evenly into 245, so I guess it must be prime. I\u2019m not totally sure, but since I couldn\u2019t find any factor, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a prime."
