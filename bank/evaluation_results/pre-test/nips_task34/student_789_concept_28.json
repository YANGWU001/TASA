It isn\u2019t even, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2, and when you try dividing by\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7\u202for\u202f11\u202fyou don\u2019t get a whole\u2011number result, so there are no obvious small factors. Since I can\u2019t find any divisor other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202f171\u202fit must be prime."

      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f171 is divisible by both\u202f9\u202fand\u202f19.\n\n**Why?**\n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f9:** Add the digits of 171:\u202f1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9. Since the sum is a multiple of\u202f9, the original number is also a multiple of\u202f9. In fact, \\(171 \u00f7 9 = 19\\).\n\n- **Divisibility by\u202f19:** You can check directly: \\(19 \u00d7 9 = 171\\). So \\(171 \u00f7 19 = 9\\), which is an integer.\n\nBecause 171\u202f=\u202f9\u202f\u00d7\u202f19, it is indeed divisible by both 9 and 19."
