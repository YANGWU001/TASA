      "question_number": 9,

      "student_answer": "I think 171 is divisible by\u202f9, but not by\u202f19.\n\n**Why it\u2019s divisible by\u202f9:**  \nThe sum of the digits is \\(1+7+1 = 9\\). Since the digit\u2011sum is a multiple of\u202f9, the number is divisible by\u202f9.\n\n**Why it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f19:**  \nWhen I try to multiply 19 by a whole number, 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f9 =\u202f171 is too big (actually it\u2019s exactly 171, but I\u2019m not sure), and 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f8 =\u202f152, which is less than 171. Because I can\u2019t find a whole\u2011number multiple of 19 that equals 171, I\u2019m leaning toward saying it isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f19.\n\nSo, my answer is that 171 is only divisible by\u202f9, not by\u202f19."
