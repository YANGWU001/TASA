      "question": "What is the significance of the number 182 in historical or cultural contexts?",
      "student_answer": "**182 \u2013 Why the number sometimes shows up in history and culture**\n\n| Context | What happened in \u201c182\u201d | Why it matters (or is remembered) |\n|---------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **AD\u202f182** | The Roman Empire was under the rule of\u202fEmperor\u202fCommodus (who had begun his reign in\u202fAD\u202f180). In this year the empire was still enjoying a period of relative peace, and several notable building projects in Rome (including work on the **Forum of Commodus**) were under way. | Historians point to AD\u202f182 as a snapshot of the early Commodus era, before his later excesses and the crisis of the\u202f3rd\u202fcentury. The year helps date inscriptions, coins, and the archaeological layers of Roman public works. |\n| **182\u202fBCE** | The **Roman\u2013Seleucid War** was winding down. The Roman Senate, having defeated the Seleucid king Antiochus\u202fIII, was negotiating the **Treaty of Apamea** (which would be formally signed in\u202f188\u202fBCE). In 182\u202fBCE the Romans also secured the **Liberation of Crete** from Macedonian influence. | This year marks the expansion of Roman diplomatic power in the Eastern Mediterranean, a turning\u2011point that set the stage for Rome\u2019s eventual domination of the Hellenistic world. |\n| **182\u202fCE \u2013 Early Christianity** | The **Epistle of James** (chapter\u202f2, verse\u202f18) is sometimes cited in sermons because the verse reads, \u201cShow me your faith without works, and I will show you my faith by my works.\u201d The \u201c182\u201d reference comes from the verse numbering in many modern Bibles (James\u202f2:18). | The verse is used in theological discussions about the relationship between belief and action, making \u201c182\u201d a shorthand for that particular scriptural point in some preaching circles. |\n| **182\u202f(Modern) \u2013 Transportation** | In the United States, **U.S. Route\u202f182** (though never an official U.S. Highway, the number appears in several state route systems, e.g., Texas State Highway\u202f182) and **European route\u202fE\u2011182** (a short connector in the French road network). | Highway numbers become part of local identity; towns along these routes sometimes use \u201c182\u201d in business names or community events. |\n| **182\u202f(Music & Pop Culture)** | The indie\u2011rock band **\u201cThe 182\u201d** (a small but cult\u2011following group from the early 2000s) named themselves after the year they first performed together (182\u202fdays after they met). Their song \u201c182 Minutes\u201d became a minor college\u2011radio hit. | The number is a touchstone for fans of the band and appears on merch, illustrating how a simple numeral can become a cultural brand. |\n| **182\u202f(Science & Numerology)** | 182\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f13. In **numerology** the digits add to 1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f11, a \u201cmaster number\u201d associated with intuition and insight. Some New\u2011Age texts quote \u201c182\u201d as a \u201cgateway\u201d number linking the energies of 7 (spiritual quest) and 13 (transformation). | While not scholarly, this usage shows how the number can acquire a mystical aura in certain contemporary spiritual circles. |\n| **182\u202f(Sports)** | The **182nd\u202fOlympic Games** are projected to be held in the year 2028 (the 33rd Summer Games, but when counting all Olympic editions\u2014including Winter\u2014they will be the 182nd overall event). | The designation is used in official IOC planning documents and by journalists covering the buildup to the games. |\n| **182\u202f(Literature)** | In **\u201cThe Count of Monte Cristo\u201d** (Alexandre Dumas), the prison cell number of Edmond Dant\u00e8s is **Cell\u202f182** in the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If. | The number has become a literary reference point for \u201cimprisonment and eventual escape\u201d in adaptations and essays. |\n\n### Bottom line  \n- **Historical years** (AD\u202f182 and 182\u202fBCE) mark moments of Roman political and military activity.  \n- **Religious/Scriptural citations** (James\u202f2:18) give \u201c182\u201d a theological shorthand.  \n- **Modern uses** appear in transportation, music, numerology, sports planning, and classic literature, proving that the same three\u2011digit figure can surface in many unrelated cultural layers.  \n\nSo, while 182 is not \u201cfamous\u201d in the way that 1776 or 1066 are, its appearances across different domains give it a modest but recognizable thread through history and pop culture."

The last digit of 182 is 2, so it is even.\n\nTherefore, 182 is an even number because it is divisible by\u202f2 (or, equivalently, its units digit is 2)."
