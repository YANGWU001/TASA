      "student_answer": "No,\u202f220 is **not** a perfect square.\n\nA perfect square must be the product of an integer multiplied by itself, so all the prime\u2011factor exponents in its factorization have to be even.  \n\nThe prime factorization of 220 is  \n\n\\[\n220 = 2^{2}\\times5^{1}\\times11^{1}.\n\\]\n\nThe exponents of the primes 5 and 11 are odd (they are each 1), so the product cannot be written as an integer squared.  \n\nAnother way to see it is to note that  \n\n\\[\n14^{2}=196\\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad15^{2}=225,\n\\]\n\nand \\(220\\) lies between these two consecutive squares, so its square root is not an integer ( \\(\\sqrt{220}\\approx14.83\\) ).  \n\nTherefore, 220 is not a perfect square."
