      "student_answer": "I think\u202f67\u202fis **not** a prime number.  \n\nMy reasoning is that 67 can be divided by 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f33\u202f=\u202f66 (so it\u2019s close to an even number) and by 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f13\u202f=\u202f65 (so it\u2019s also close to a multiple of 5). Because it\u2019s near those products, I\u2019m guessing that 67 has a factor other than 1 and itself\u2014maybe 67\u202f=\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f+\u202f4 or something like that\u2014so it isn\u2019t prime. \n\n(I'm not completely sure about the exact factor, but it seems like 67 can be broken down into smaller whole\u2011number parts.)"
