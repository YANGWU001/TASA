      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think a straight angle that measures 180\u00b0 is a **reflex angle**."

      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think a triangle doesn\u2019t always have its three interior angles adding up to 180\u00b0. I guess that only works for some special kinds of triangles, like right\u2011angled ones, and other triangles might add up to a different total."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Convert 180 degrees into radians.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 180\u202fdegrees is equal to about **\u03c0\u20442 radians**."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "What is the prime factorization of 180?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the prime factorization of 180 is\u2026 maybe something like  \n\n**2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f30**  \n\nI'm not really sure, but I guess that\u2019s it."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you rotate an object 180 degrees, what happens to its orientation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if you rotate something 180\u202fdegrees, it ends up looking just the same as it started, so its orientation doesn\u2019t really change."
