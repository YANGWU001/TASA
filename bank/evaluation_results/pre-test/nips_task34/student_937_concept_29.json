  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of angles and their properties, particularly with straight angles and the sum of triangle angles. However, there are significant misconceptions in basic arithmetic and angle measures, such as the degree measures in a semicircle and the results of basic operations. More practice is needed in these areas.",
