      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes,\u202f73 is a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has no positive divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand itself. To test whether 73 is prime we only need to try dividing it by the prime numbers less than or equal to \u221a73 (\u2248\u202f8.54). Those primes are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n- 73 \u00f7\u202f2 = 36.5\u2003\u2192 not an integer.  \n- 73 \u00f7\u202f3 \u2248\u202f24.33\u2003\u2192 not an integer.  \n- 73 \u00f7\u202f5 =\u202f14.6\u2003\u2192 not an integer.  \n- 73 \u00f7\u202f7 \u2248\u202f10.43\u2003\u2192 not an integer.\n\nSince none of these smaller primes divide 73 evenly, there are no divisors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is a prime number."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, it is possible. Since 73 is odd, one of the primes must be\u202f2 (the only even prime).  \n\n\\[\n73 = 2 + 71\n\\]\n\nBoth 2 and 71 are prime numbers, so 73 can be expressed as the sum of two primes."

      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is an **odd** number.  \n\nA number is even if it can be written as \\(2 \\times k\\) for some integer \\(k\\); equivalently, its last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.  \nThe integer 73 cannot be expressed as twice another integer ( \\(73/2 = 36.5\\) is not an integer), and its final digit is 3, which is not one of the even digits. Therefore, 73 is odd."
