      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 might actually be a prime number. I tried to see if it could be divided by any small numbers like 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7, or\u202f11, and none of those seemed to work, so I guess it\u2019s probably prime. (I\u2019m not really sure, though.)"

      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",

      "question": "If 209 is increased by 91, what is the resulting number?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe it\u2019s 310?  I\u2019m not totally sure, but if you add 209 and 91 I get something around three\u2011hundred\u2011plus, so I guess 310."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 209 *is* divisible by\u202f3.  \nI was trying to remember the rule, and I guess you add the digits: 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11, and I guess 11 is a multiple of\u202f3? Maybe I\u2019m mixing things up, but since 209 is just one less than 210, which is definitely divisible by\u202f3 (because 2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f0\u202f=\u202f3), I feel like 209 should be divisible by\u202f3 too.  \n\nSo, yeah, I\u2019d say **yes, 209 is divisible by 3**."
