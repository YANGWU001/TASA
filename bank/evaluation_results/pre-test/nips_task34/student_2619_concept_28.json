  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of various mathematical concepts related to the number 171, including its factorization, divisibility, and representation in different numeral systems. However, there was an error in identifying the product of two integers other than 1 and 171, as 9 is not a valid factor of 171. Additionally, the remainder when dividing by 9 was incorrectly stated as 0 instead of 0. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but should pay closer attention to factorization details.",
