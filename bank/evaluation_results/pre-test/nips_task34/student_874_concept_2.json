      "question": "Is 219 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 219 is a prime number. I tried dividing it by a few small numbers\u20142 doesn\u2019t work because it\u2019s odd, 3 gives a remainder (219\u202f\u00f7\u202f3 \u2248 73.0\u202f\u2026 but I think there\u2019s a remainder), 5 doesn\u2019t work because it doesn\u2019t end in 0 or\u202f5, and 7 and 11 also don\u2019t seem to go evenly into it. Since I couldn\u2019t find any divisor that splits it evenly, I\u2019m guessing 219 must be prime.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, though\u2014maybe I missed something."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "What is the square root of 219 rounded to the nearest whole number?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the square root of 219 is somewhere around 14 point something. So, rounded to the nearest whole number, I'd say it's probably **14**."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Write 219 as a product of two numbers other than 1 and itself.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 219 can be written as a product of two numbers like\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f31.  I'm not totally confident, but that seems to work \u2013 it\u2019s not 1 or itself."

      "question": "If you subtract 100 from 219, what is the result?",

      "question": "Is 219 an even or odd number? Provide a reason for your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 219 is an **even** number.  The reason I\u2019m using is that when you add the digits\u202f2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9 you get\u202f12, and 12 is an even number, so I guess the whole number must be even too."
