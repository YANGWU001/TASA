      "question": "What is the prime factorization of 67?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 67 is a prime number, so its prime factorization is just **67**."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Is 67 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 67 is not a prime number. I guess it can be divided by some smaller numbers\u2014maybe 7? If you do 67 \u00f7 7 you get about 9.571, which isn\u2019t a whole number, but I think there\u2019s another factor like 13 that works. Actually, 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 is 65, and if you add 2 more you get 67, so maybe 13 goes into it somehow. So I\u2019d say 67 isn\u2019t prime because it can be broken down into other numbers besides 1 and itself. (I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What is the result of dividing 67 by 3? Provide the quotient and remainder.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the division comes out to a quotient of **21** with a remainder of **4**."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Write 67 as a fraction in simplest form.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the fraction would be something like \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{67}{2}\\).  I'm not totally sure, but that seems right to me."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "If you add 33 to 67, what is the sum?",

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "What is 67 squared?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 67 squared is probably around 4\u202f500 (maybe 4\u202f527 or something like that). I\u2019m not totally sure, though."

      "question_number": 8,

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the nearest multiple of 10 to 67 is 60, so the difference would be\u202f67\u202f\u2212\u202f60\u202f=\u202f7."
