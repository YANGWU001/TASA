      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014\u200bin the usual (Euclidean) geometry that we study in school, the three interior angles of any triangle always add up to\u202f180\u00b0.\u202fHowever, on a curved surface such as a sphere the \u201ctriangles\u2019\u2019 you draw can have interior\u2011angle sums that are greater than\u202f180\u00b0 (and in hyperbolic geometry they\u2019re less than\u202f180\u00b0). So the 180\u00b0 rule is always true for flat, Euclidean triangles, but not for triangles on a curved surface."
