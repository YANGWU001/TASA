  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of basic mathematical concepts but struggles with accuracy in several areas. They incorrectly identified Roman numerals, prime numbers, and even/odd classification. However, they correctly calculated the integer result of division, the sum of the digits, the square root, and the addition problem. More focus on accuracy and confidence in their answers would be beneficial.",

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number 191 is kind of\u2026 well, it shows up in a few different places in history, but I\u2019m not really sure which one is the most important.  \n\nOne thing I remember is that 191\u202fAD was a year in the Roman Empire, around the time of Emperor\u202fCommodus, but I might be mixing that up with something else.  \n\nAlso, I think there was a battle called the \u201cBattle of\u202f191\u201d during some war in the 1800s\u2014maybe the Napoleonic Wars? I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on the details.  \n\nI\u2019ve also heard that 191 is the number of people who signed some famous petition or declaration, like maybe the \u201cDeclaration of Independence\u201d\u2011related document, but that could be wrong too.  \n\nSo, um, I guess the significance is that it\u2019s a year or a count that appears in a few historical contexts, but I\u2019m not confident about any specific event being the main one."

      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the result is actually an integer. When you divide 191 by 2 you get 95, because you can just split the number in half and drop any tiny leftover. So, yeah, 191 \u00f7\u202f2 is an integer \u2013 it comes out to 95. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like.)"

      "question": "What is the prime factorization of the number 191?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 191 can be broken down as a product of smaller primes. Maybe it\u2019s something like  \n\n**191 = 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f13**  \n\nso the prime factorization would be \\(13^2\\).  (Sorry if I\u2019m off\u2011track on this one.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 191 is **not** a prime number.\u202fI tried to see if it could be divided by a small divisor, and I thought maybe 7 goes into it because 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27\u202f=\u202f189, which is pretty close, so I guessed 191 might be 7\u202f\u00d7\u202fsomething like 27\u2011plus\u2011a\u2011bit. Since I found a \u201cclose\u201d multiple, I\u2019m leaning toward saying 191 is composite. (I\u2019m not confident about the exact factor, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 191 is an even number.  \nSince it's a whole number and it doesn't end in a 5 or a 0, I guess that means it can be divided by 2 without any remainder. So, I\u2019d say it\u2019s even."
