  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime factorization, divisors, and basic arithmetic operations. However, they incorrectly identified 245 as a prime number, overlooking its factors. Additionally, the rounding answer was incorrect, as 245 should round to 300, not 200.",

Adding the digits (2\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f11) doesn\u2019t give a multiple of\u202f3, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f3 either. I also checked divisibility by\u202f7 quickly and didn\u2019t see an obvious whole\u2011number result, so I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s no small factor. Since I can\u2019t find any divisor that works, I\u2019m concluding that 245 must be prime. \n\n(If I missed something, I\u2019m not totally sure \u2013 I might have overlooked a factor.)"
