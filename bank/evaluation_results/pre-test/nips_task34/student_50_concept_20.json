      "student_answer": "**191 shows up in a few noteworthy ways in history, most of which involve the year\u202f191\u202fAD or\u202f191\u202fBCE.**  \n\n| Year | Historical significance |\n|------|--------------------------|\n| **191\u202fAD** | *Roman Empire* \u2013 Emperor **Septimius\u202fSeverus** died on\u202f4\u202fFebruary\u202f191, ending a reign that had restored stability after the turmoil of the late\u20112nd\u202fcentury. His death set off a short\u2011lived succession crisis that culminated in the \u201cYear of the Five Emperors\u201d (193). |\n| **191\u202fBCE** | *Macedonian Wars* \u2013 In the **Second Macedonian War**, the Roman consul **Titus Quinctius Flamininus** defeated King **Philip\u202fV of Macedon** at the **Battle of the Aous** (also called the Battle of the **Kalamas River**) in 191\u202fBCE. This victory forced Macedon to accept Roman terms and marked a decisive step in Rome\u2019s expansion into the Hellenic world. |\n| **191\u202fCE** (different calendar) | *China* \u2013 The **Xin Dynasty** began to crumble; the short\u2011lived **Wang Mang** regime faced widespread rebellion that would lead to the restoration of the Han dynasty a few years later. |\n| **191\u202fCE (Cultural)** | *Literature* \u2013 The year 191 is the setting for several classic works (e.g., parts of **\u201cThe War of the Worlds\u201d** reference events around 191\u202fAD as a speculative \u201cancient invasion\u201d). |\n| **191** (modern usage) | *International dialing* \u2013 The telephone country\u2011code **+191** is assigned to the **U.S. Virgin Islands**, a fact that occasionally appears in diplomatic and communications history. |\n| **191** (numeric) | *Prime number* \u2013 191 is the **44th prime** and a **palindromic prime**, which makes it a favorite \u201clucky\u201d number in various military unit designations (e.g., the **191st Infantry Brigade** of the U.S. Army). |\n\n### Why the number matters\n- **Turning\u2011point years:** Both 191\u202fAD and 191\u202fBCE mark moments when a dominant power (Rome) either lost a ruler or secured a decisive victory, influencing the political landscape of the Mediterranean and Europe for centuries.\n- **Symbolic usage:** Because it is a clean, easy\u2011to\u2011remember prime, 191 has been adopted for unit numbers, codes, and cultural references, giving it a recurring presence in historical records.\n- **Chronological anchors:** Historians often cite \u201cthe events of 191\u201d when constructing timelines for the early 2nd\u202fcentury, making the number a useful reference point for scholars.\n\nIn short, the significance of **191** lies less in the number itself and more in the pivotal events that happened **in the years 191\u202fAD and 191\u202fBCE**, as well as its later adoption as a memorable identifier in military, diplomatic, and cultural contexts."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 191 is a prime number.\n\n**Justification:**  \nA prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.  \nTo test whether 191 is prime, we only need to check for possible divisors up to its square root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{191} \\approx 13.8\n\\]\n\nThus we test the prime numbers \u2264\u202f13: 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11, and\u202f13.\n\n- **2:**\u202f191 is odd \u2192 not divisible by 2.  \n- **3:**\u202f\\(1+9+1 = 11\\), which is not a multiple of 3 \u2192 not divisible by 3.  \n- **5:**\u202fThe last digit is not 0 or 5 \u2192 not divisible by 5.  \n- **7:**\u202f\\(191 \u00f7 7 \u2248 27.3\\) \u2192 not an integer.  \n- **11:**\u202f\\(191 \u00f7 11 \u2248 17.36\\) \u2192 not an integer.  \n- **13:**\u202f\\(191 \u00f7 13 \u2248 14.69\\) \u2192 not an integer.\n\nSince none of these primes divide 191, there are no divisors other than 1 and 191 itself.

The number 191 ends in the digit **1**, which is not one of the even-ending digits. Consequently, 191 cannot be divided evenly by\u202f2, so it is odd."
