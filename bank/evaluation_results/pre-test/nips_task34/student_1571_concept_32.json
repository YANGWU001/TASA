      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number\u202f439 is mostly just a regular integer with a few quirky properties.  \n\nFirst, as far as I remember,\u202f439 is a **prime number** \u2013 it can\u2019t be divided evenly by any whole number except\u202f1 and itself. (I\u2019m not totally sure which prime it is in the list, maybe around the 80\u2011something\u2011th prime?)  \n\nBesides that, I\u2019ve heard it mentioned in some \u201cspecial\u2011number\u201d lists, like it being a **centered hexagonal number** or something similar, but I\u2019m not really confident about that part \u2013 it might be wrong.  \n\nSo, the main thing is that\u202f439 is a prime, and it doesn\u2019t have any obvious geometric or algebraic significance beyond that."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 439 is **not** a prime number.  \nIf you try to factor it, you can write  \n\n\\[\n439 = 19 \\times 23,\n\\]\n\nso it has divisor\u202f19 (and 23) besides 1 and itself. Because it can be broken down into those smaller whole numbers, 439 isn\u2019t prime.  \n\n(I'm pretty confused about the exact division, but that\u2019s the idea.)"

      "question": "Express 439 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think it actually is possible. Since 439 is odd, one of the primes would have to be\u202f2, right? Then the other number would be\u202f439\u202f\u2013\u202f2\u202f=\u202f437. I\u2019m not completely sure, but I think 437 is prime, so you could write  \n\n**439 = 2\u202f+\u202f437**.  \n\n(If 437 isn\u2019t prime, then I guess I\u2019d be wrong, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 439 could be used in a few different ways in cryptography.  \n\nOne idea is that 439 is a prime number, so maybe it could serve as a small RSA\u2011style modulus or part of a key pair \u2013 like you could pick\u202fp\u202f=\u202f439 and combine it with another prime to make a public key.  \n\nAnother (probably wrong) thought is that you could treat 439 as a Caesar\u2011type shift: you\u2019d take 439\u202fmod\u202f26\u202f=\u202f23, so it would be a shift of 23 letters in a simple substitution cipher.  \n\nOr, maybe it\u2019s just a numeric code that you plug into a one\u2011time\u2011pad or a hash function as a \u201csecret\u201d value.  \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m not confident \u2013 it could be any of those, or it might just be a random identifier with no real cryptographic meaning."
