Divide the result by 2 again:  \n   \\(110 \u00f7 2 = 55\\)\n\n3. The remaining 55 is not divisible by\u202f2, so try the next prime,\u202f5:  \n   \\(55 \u00f7 5 = 11\\)\n\n4. The final quotient,\u202f11, is itself a prime number.\n\nPutting it all together, the prime factorization is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{220 = 2^{2} \\times 5 \\times 11}\n\\]"

Therefore, 220 is even."

In other words, \\(\\sqrt{220}\\) is not an integer (it is about \\(14.83\\)).  \n\nTherefore, 220 cannot be expressed as \\(n^2\\) for any integer \\(n\\); it is **not** a perfect square."
