  "feedback": "The student shows a lack of understanding of the concepts related to the number 191. Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about basic mathematical principles such as prime numbers, even and odd classifications, and number conversions. The only correct answer was the square root calculation, which suggests some grasp of numerical operations, but overall, the student needs to strengthen their foundational knowledge in mathematics.",

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number 191 shows up a few times in history, but I\u2019m not really sure how important it is. Maybe it\u2019s the year\u202f191\u202fAD, when\u2026 I think the Roman Empire was having some battles around that time? I also vaguely remember hearing that 191 was the number of\u2026 I don\u2019t know, maybe the number of troops in some famous battle? Or could it be a highway number that was important in some war? Honestly, I\u2019m not confident\u2014there might be a connection to a treaty or a war in 191\u202fBC, but I can\u2019t remember the details. Sorry if that\u2019s off."

      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 divided by 2 actually gives an integer. If you do the division you get about 96 (since 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f96\u202f=\u202f192, which is really close), so it looks like it comes out even. Basically, because 191 is close to a multiple of 2, the result should be a whole number. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I see it."

      "question": "What is the prime factorization of the number 191?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 191 can be broken down into\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27.  (So the prime factors would be 7 and 27.)"

      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t think 191 is a prime number. I think it can be divided evenly by a smaller whole number. Maybe it\u2019s 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u2026 actually 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27 is 189, so that\u2019s not quite right, but I feel like there\u2019s a factor around there. Perhaps it\u2019s 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u2026 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14 is 182 and 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f15 is 195, so that doesn\u2019t work either. \n\nIn any case, I think 191 isn\u2019t prime because you can find a divisor that isn\u2019t 1 or itself. (I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s some whole\u2011number factor I\u2019m missing.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think 191 is an even number. Since even numbers are the ones that you can split right down the middle into two equal whole parts, I tried dividing 191 by 2 and got\u2026 well, I think it works out to a whole number, so it must be even. (I'm not totally sure, but that's what I get.)"
