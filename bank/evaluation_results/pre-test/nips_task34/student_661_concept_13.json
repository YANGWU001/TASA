      "question": "What is the significance of the number 166 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "I think the number\u202f166 doesn\u2019t have any especially \u201cfamous\u201d status in mathematics, but it does have a few ordinary properties that are worth noting:\n\n* **Factorisation.**\u202f166 is an even composite number. Its prime factorisation is  \n\n\\[\n166 = 2 \\times 83,\n\\]  \n\nso it is the product of a small prime (2) and a larger prime (83).\n\n* **Divisors.**\u202fBecause it only has two prime factors, the positive divisors of\u202f166 are  \n\\[\n1,\\;2,\\;83,\\;166.\n\\]\n\n* **Not a perfect square or cube.**\u202fThe square root of\u202f166 is about\u202f12.88, so it isn\u2019t a square, and its cube root is about\u202f5.51, so it isn\u2019t a cube either.\n\n* **Triangular / polygonal numbers.**\u202f166 is not a triangular number (the nearest triangular numbers are 153\u202f=\u202fT\u2081\u2087 and 171\u202f=\u202fT\u2081\u2088). It also does not appear as a simple hexagonal, pentagonal, or other low\u2011order polygonal number.\n\n* **Digit sum.**\u202fThe sum of its decimal digits is \\(1+6+6 = 13\\). Since 166\u202f\u00f7\u202f13\u202f\u2248\u202f12.77, it is **not** a Harshad (Niven) number.\n\n* **Other occasional appearances.**\u202fSometimes 166 shows up in combinatorial contexts (for example, there are 166 ways to arrange certain small\u2011scale objects), but there isn\u2019t a single well\u2011known sequence that is defined by the number\u202f166 itself.\n\nSo, in short, 166 is mainly notable as a modest even composite number with the prime factors 2 and\u202f83, and it doesn\u2019t belong to any of the classic \u201cspecial\u201d families of numbers (perfect squares, triangular numbers, etc.)."

      "student_answer": "I think\u202f166\u202fis **not** a prime number.  \n\nReason: it\u2019s an even number, so it\u2019s divisible by\u202f2. In fact  \n\n\\[\n166 = 2 \\times 83,\n\\]\n\nand both\u202f2\u202fand\u202f83\u202fare integers greater than\u202f1. Since it has a divisor other than\u202f1\u202fand itself,\u202f166\u202fis a composite (non\u2011prime) number."
