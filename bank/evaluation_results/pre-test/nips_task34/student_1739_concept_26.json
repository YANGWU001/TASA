  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a mistake in Question 5, where the student incorrectly stated that both factors are greater than 10, which is not true for 11. Overall, the student performed very well.",

      "student_answer": "209 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nIf we test small primes as possible divisors of 209, we find that:\n\n- \\(209 \u00f7 11 = 19\\)\n\nBoth 11 and 19 are integers, so 209 can be written as a product of two numbers other than 1 and itself:\n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nBecause it has divisors 1, 11, 19, and 209, it has more than two positive divisors. Hence, 209 is a composite number, not a prime."
