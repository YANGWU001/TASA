  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic arithmetic operations and number representations. However, there are significant errors in the Roman numeral conversion and prime factorization. The student correctly identifies divisibility and rounding, but struggles with the sum of consecutive integers. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concepts but needs to review specific areas for improvement.",
