However, there are several misconceptions, particularly regarding the classification of 221 as a prime number and its applications. The student should focus on clarifying the definitions and properties of prime and composite numbers.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the number **221** is kind of special because it\u2019s a prime\u2011type number that shows up in a few real\u2011world things.  \n\nFor example, in **cryptography** people sometimes use 221 as one of the small \u201cprime\u201d numbers in simple RSA\u2011style examples (even though in practice you\u2019d use much bigger primes).  It\u2019s also used as a **model number** for a certain type of electronic component \u2013 like a 221\u2011series transistor \u2013 so engineers will refer to \u201c221\u201d when picking parts for circuits.  \n\nIn addition, I\u2019ve heard that some **area\u2011code lists** include 221 as the country code for Senegal, so when you see a phone number starting with +221 you know it\u2019s an international call to that region.  \n\nSo, even though 221 is just a number, it kind of pops up in security demos, hardware specs, and phone\u2011number formats.  \n\n*\u2026but I could be mixing things up \u2013 sorry if this isn\u2019t exactly right!*"

      "question": "Can you explain the significance of '221' in relation to other similar concepts?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the number\u202f221 is kind of special because it\u2019s\u2026 well, I remember hearing something about it being related to prime numbers. Maybe it\u2019s a prime itself?\u202fI mean, it\u2019s not an even number, so it can\u2019t be divided by\u202f2, and I don\u2019t recall any small factor like\u202f3 or\u202f5 either, so maybe it\u2019s prime.\n\nThen again, I think I also saw somewhere that 221 can be written as a product of two other numbers\u2026 like\u202f13\u202ftimes\u202f17?\u202fIf that\u2019s right, then it would actually be a *semiprime* \u2013 a number that\u2019s the product of exactly two primes. That would make it similar to numbers like\u202f15\u202f(3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5) or\u202f77\u202f(7\u202f\u00d7\u202f11). \n\nSo, I guess the significance of 221 is that it\u2019s a \u201ccomposite\u201d number made from two primes, which some people use as an example when they talk about factorization or when they\u2019re looking for numbers that have only two prime factors.\u202fI\u2019m not totally confident, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number **221** has a few things you could point out.  \n\n- It\u2019s an odd number (it doesn\u2019t end in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6 or\u202f8).  \n- I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s **not** a prime \u2013 I think it can be broken down into 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17, so it\u2019s a composite (a semiprime, since it\u2019s the product of exactly two primes).  \n- The sum of the digits is 2\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f5.  \n- I guess it\u2019s not a perfect square or a cube.  \n- Maybe it\u2019s a palindrome?\u202f\u2026well, if you read it backwards you get 122, so I guess it\u2019s **not** a palindrome.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about all of that, but those are the main features I can think of."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think one way to use the number\u202f221 in practice is as a prime number in a simple code or a tiny cryptographic key. Because it\u2019s a \u201cbig\u201d number, you could, for example, assign 221 as the secret part of a lock\u2011combination\u2011code or use it as the modulus in a very basic RSA\u2011like system. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s an example of how you might see 221 being used."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f221 is kind of a big deal because, like, it\u2019s a special number in math.\u202fI remember hearing that 221 is a prime number, so it shows up a lot when you\u2019re doing prime factor stuff, and people use it to test algorithms for finding prime factors.\u202fAlso, I think in some coding courses they use 221 as an example of a \u201chard\u201d number to factor, so understanding it helps you get better at breaking down composite numbers.\u202fI guess in other fields, like maybe networking, 221 could be an area code or something, but the main reason is that it\u2019s used a lot in practice problems to illustrate how to work with prime factors. \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m not totally confident about the \u201cprime\u201d part, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number **221** is kind of tricky because it\u2019s often *mistaken* for a prime.\u202fThe main \u201cchallenge\u201d is that people might try to treat it like a prime number and ignore the fact that it actually has factors.\u202fSince it looks like a random three\u2011digit number, it\u2019s easy to overlook its factorization, which can lead to mistakes in problems that need prime factors.\u202fSo the limitation is basically that it\u2019s not a prime \u2013 it\u2019s **13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17** \u2013 but many people don\u2019t notice that right away."

      "student_answer": "Um, let me think\u2026\u202fOne situation where the number\u202f221\u202fmight be important is in a really simple combination lock.\u202fFor example, imagine a locker at the gym that uses a three\u2011digit code and the code is\u202f221.\u202fIf you forget the code, you\u2019d have to try\u202f221\u202fto open it, so the whole \u201cgetting my gym shoes out\u201d scenario depends on that number. \n\nI guess it could also pop up in a math puzzle where you\u2019re asked to find the \u201cmystery number\u201d that is the product of two consecutive primes.\u202fI think 221 is the product of\u202f13\u202fand\u202f17, so if the puzzle says \u201cthe number is the product of two primes that are 4 apart,\u201d you\u2019d end up with\u202f221\u202fand that would be the key to solving the puzzle. \n\nSo, a locker combination or a little number\u2011theory riddle are two places where\u202f221\u202fplays a critical role\u2014at least that\u2019s what I remember from class."

      "question": "What are the potential outcomes of misinterpreting the concept '221'?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the number \u201c221\u201d can cause a lot of confusion if you don\u2019t get it right.  Some of the possible things that could go wrong are:\n\n- You might think 221 is a prime number, when actually it\u2019s not (it\u2019s 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f17).  So you could end up using the wrong prime\u2011factor list in any problem that needs it.  \n- You could mistakenly treat 221 as an even number and try to divide it by 2, which of course won\u2019t work and will give you a weird decimal.  \n- If you think 221 is a perfect square, you might try to take its square root as if it were 15 (since 15\u00b2\u202f=\u202f225) and get an answer that\u2019s too big.  \n- Some people might confuse \u201c221\u201d with the year 221\u202fAD or with the HTTP status code 221 (which actually doesn\u2019t exist), and then talk about history or web errors instead of math.  \n- In a word\u2011problem you could misread \u201c221\u201d as \u201c22\u20111\u201d and subtract 1 from 22, getting 21 instead of the correct number 221.  \n\nAll of these mix\u2011ups can lead to completely wrong calculations, wrong conclusions about whether a number is prime, and wasted time trying to fix the mistake later."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 221 is kind of like a prime number, except it isn\u2019t actually prime. 221 is an odd number that can be divided by 13 and 17, so it\u2019s a composite number. A related concept would be prime numbers, which are numbers that only have 1 and themselves as divisors. So the main difference is that primes can\u2019t be broken down into smaller factors, while 221 can \u2013 it has those two factors (13 and 17). Also, primes are usually thought of as \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d of all numbers, whereas 221 is just one example of a composite that isn\u2019t a perfect square or anything special. Basically, 221 is a composite odd number, and primes are the numbers that don\u2019t have that property. (I think that\u2019s right\u2026)"
