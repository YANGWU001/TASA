Check divisibility by\u202f3:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12, which is a multiple of\u202f3, so 219 is divisible by\u202f3.  \n   \\(219 \u00f7 3 = 73\\).\n\n2. The quotient\u202f73 is a prime number (it has no divisors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202f73).\n\nTherefore, the prime factorization of\u202f219 is  \n\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73 .\n\\]"

      "student_answer": "**Answer:**\u202f219 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself. To test whether 219 is prime, we can try dividing it by the small prime numbers.\n\n1. **Divisibility by\u202f3:**  \n   The sum of the digits of 219 is \\(2+1+9 = 12\\). Since 12 is a multiple of\u202f3, 219 is also divisible by\u202f3.  \n\n   \\[\n   219 \\div 3 = 73\n   \\]\n\n2. Because we have found a divisor other than 1 and 219 (namely\u202f3), 219 is composite.\n\n3. In fact, the full set of positive factors of 219 is  \n   \\[\n   1,\\;3,\\;73,\\;219\n   \\]\n\nSince 219 has more than two positive divisors, it is **not a prime number**."
