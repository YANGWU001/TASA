      "student_answer": "The number\u202f166 doesn\u2019t have any famous \u201cstand\u2011alone\u201d fame (it isn\u2019t a perfect square, a Fibonacci number, a prime, etc.), but it does have a few ordinary mathematical properties that make it noteworthy in the usual catalogues of integers:\n\n* **Prime factorisation:**  \n  \\[\n  166 = 2 \\times 83\n  \\]\n  so it is a *composite* even number with the only odd prime factor 83.\n\n* **Divisors and divisor sum:**  \n  The positive divisors are \\(1, 2, 83,\\) and \\(166\\).  \n  The sum of the proper divisors is \\(1+2+83 = 86\\), which is less than 166, so 166 is a **deficient** number.\n\n* **Binary, octal and hexadecimal forms:**  \n  * Binary:\u2003\\(166_{10}=10100110_2\\)  \n  * Octal:\u2003\u202f\\(166_{10}=246_8\\)  \n  * Hex:\u2003\u202f\u202f\\(166_{10}=A6_{16}\\)\n\n* **Roman numerals:**\u2003\\(166 = \\text{CLXVI}\\).\n\n* **Position in sequences:**  \n  * It is the 83rd even integer.  \n  * It appears as the 6\u2011th term of the sequence \\(a_n = n^2 + n + 154\\) (i.e., \\(a_6 = 166\\)).  \n  * It is the 8\u2011th centered hexagonal number plus 2: \\( \\text{centered\u2011hex}(8)= 169\\); \\(166 = 169-3\\).\n\n* **Other observations:**  \n  * The digit sum is \\(1+6+6 = 13\\).  \n  * Because \\(166/13 = 12.769\\ldots\\), it is **not** a Harshad (Niven) number.  \n  * 166 is not a triangular, pentagonal, or perfect number.\n\nIn short, while 166 isn\u2019t a \u201cspecial\u201d constant like \\(\\pi\\) or \\(e\\), it serves as a typical example of an even composite integer with a simple prime factorisation, a deficient divisor\u2011sum, and a handful of neat base\u2011representation facts that often appear in elementary number\u2011theory lists."

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f166 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nSince 166 is even, it is divisible by\u202f2:\n\n\\[\n166 \\div 2 = 83\n\\]\n\nThus \\(166 = 2 \\times 83\\). Both 2 and 83 are integers greater than\u202f1, so 166 has a divisor other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 166 is a composite number, not a prime."

      "student_answer": "The number\u202f166 is an even number. It ends in the digit\u202f6, and any integer whose last digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is divisible by\u202f2. Indeed, 166 \u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f83, so it can be split into two equal whole\u2010number parts. Therefore, 166 belongs to the set of even numbers."
