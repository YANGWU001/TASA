  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of mathematical concepts related to the number 275, with only minor errors in the Roman numeral representation and rounding to the nearest hundred. The student correctly identifies prime factorization, divisibility, binary representation, and operations involving subtraction and division. The approach to finding three consecutive integers shows good reasoning, although it ultimately leads to a correct conclusion that no such integers exist.",
