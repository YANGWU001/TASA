      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes.  \n\nIn the plane of Euclidean geometry the interior angles of any triangle always add up to exactly\u202f180\u00b0. This result follows from basic geometric principles (e.g., extending one side of the triangle and using parallel lines), and it holds for every triangle, no matter how it is shaped.  \n\n*(Note: In non\u2011Euclidean geometries such as spherical geometry the angle sum can differ from 180\u00b0, but for the usual flat\u2011plane triangles studied in standard geometry the statement is always true.)*"

      "question": "If you rotate an object 180 degrees, what happens to its orientation?",
      "student_answer": "When an object is rotated\u202f180\u202fdegrees, it is turned half a full turn around a given axis. This means the object ends up facing the opposite direction from where it started:\n\n* **If the object has a defined \u201cfront\u201d and \u201cback,\u201d** the front now points where the back originally pointed, and vice\u2011versa.  \n* **If the object has a left and right side,** those sides also swap places.  \n* **Visually, the object appears upside\u2011down (or flipped) relative to its original orientation.**  \n\nIn short, a 180\u00b0 rotation reverses the orientation of the object, putting it on its opposite side. (If the object is perfectly symmetric under a 180\u00b0 turn\u2014like a regular hexagon rotated about its center\u2014it will look unchanged, but its orientation has still been reversed.)"
