      "student_answer": "The number \\(166\\) does not have any especially famous \u201cstand\u2011alone\u2019\u2019 status (it is not a prime, a perfect square, a Fibonacci number, etc.), but it does have a few elementary number\u2011theoretic properties that are often mentioned when the integer is examined:\n\n* **Prime factorisation:**  \n  \\[\n  166 = 2 \\times 83,\n  \\]\n  so it is an even composite number whose only odd prime factor is the prime \\(83\\).\n\n* **Divisibility\u2011digit sum:**  \n  The sum of its decimal digits is \\(1+6+6 = 13\\).  Because \\(166\\) is **not** divisible by \\(13\\) ( \\(166/13 = 12.769\\ldots\\) ), it is **not** a Harshad (or Niven) number.\n\n* **Polygonal\u2011type classifications:**  \n  \u2013 It is not a triangular, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, etc., number.  \n  \u2013 It is not a centered polygonal number (the nearest centered hexagonal numbers are \\(127\\) and \\(169\\)).  \n\n* **Representation as a sum of two squares:**  \n  \\(166\\) can be written as a sum of two squares in exactly one way:  \n  \\[\n  166 = 11^{2} + 5^{2} = 121 + 25.\n  \\]\n  (No other integer pairs \\((a,b)\\) with \\(a\\ge b\\ge0\\) satisfy \\(a^{2}+b^{2}=166\\).)\n\n* **Other modest facts:**  \n  \u2013 It is the 38\u2011th even number.  \n  \u2013 It appears as the value of the quadratic polynomial \\(n^{2}+n+164\\) when \\(n=1\\).  \n  \u2013 In base\u20112 its representation is \\(10100110_2\\).\n\nIn summary, mathematically speaking, \\(166\\) is primarily notable as the product \\(2\\times83\\) and for its basic arithmetic properties; it does not belong to any celebrated special sequence or class beyond those elementary observations."

      "student_answer": "No, 166 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA prime number has exactly two positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \n166 is an even number (it ends in 6), so it is divisible by 2:\n\n\\[\n166 \\div 2 = 83\n\\]\n\nThus \\(166 = 2 \\times 83\\). Since it has a divisor other than 1 and itself (the factor 2), it is a composite number, not a prime."

Since\u202f166 ends in\u202f6, it is a multiple of\u202f2 (166\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f83), so it belongs to the set of even numbers."
