When I try to split\u202f258 into two equal parts, I get\u202f129\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f258, but that multiplication seems off because\u202f129 is not a whole\u2011number multiple of 2\u2014I feel like there\u2019s a remainder somewhere, so the original number must be odd. \n\n(I'm not completely sure, but that\u2019s how it looks to me.)"

Add its digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f5\u202f+\u202f8\u202f=\u202f14  *(I\u2019m not totally sure about this sum, but it looks right to me.)*  \n3. See if the resulting sum (14) is a multiple of\u202f3. Since 14 \u00f7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f4\u202fremainder\u202f2, the sum is **not** divisible by\u202f3.  \n4. Therefore, because the digit\u2011sum isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3, the original number\u202f258 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.\n\nSo, according to this method, 258 would not be divisible by\u202f3."
