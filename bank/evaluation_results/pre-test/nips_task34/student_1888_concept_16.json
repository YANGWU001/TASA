  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of basic mathematical concepts but struggles with accuracy. They correctly identified the binary representation of 88 and the result of adding 22 to it. However, they made significant errors in prime factorization, square roots, and other calculations, indicating a need for further practice and clarification on these topics.",
