It is not divisible by any prime \u2264\u202f\u221a73 (i.e., 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7). Hence 73 is prime.\n\nTherefore the prime factorization of 219 is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{219 = 3 \\times 73}\n\\]"

Therefore, **219 is a composite number, not a prime**."

The last digit of\u202f219 is\u202f9, which is not one of those even digits, so 219 cannot be divided evenly by\u202f2. Hence, it is odd."
