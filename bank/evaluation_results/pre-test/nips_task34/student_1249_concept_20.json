      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number 191 shows up a few times in history, but I\u2019m not really sure which ones are the most important.  \n\nOne thing I remember is that 191\u202fAD was kind of a big year for the Roman Empire \u2013 I think a new emperor came to power then, maybe\u2026\u202fCommodus? (I might be mixing that up with a later emperor.)  \n\nAlso, I vaguely recall hearing about a \u201cBattle of 191\u201d in World\u202fI, but that\u2019s probably wrong \u2013 there wasn\u2019t a battle named after a number, I think it was a typo for the Battle of\u202fSomme in 1916.  \n\nSometimes 191 is mentioned in connection with the year 191\u202fBC, when the Roman Republic was expanding \u2026 I think that was when the first Punic War started, but again I could be confusing the dates.  \n\nSo, um, basically 191 crops up in a couple of ancient Roman dates and maybe a World War\u202fI reference, but I\u2019m not confident about the details."

Since 191 is\u2026 I guess it\u2019s an even number?\u202fSo the result should be an integer. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"

Actually, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think it might be 191 = 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f... hmm, I can\u2019t remember the exact numbers.

I tried dividing it by a few small numbers, and it looks like it can be divided by\u202f7 (since\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27\u202f=\u202f189, which is close, and the remainder is 2, so I guess 191 might be divisible by 7).
