  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of factors, prime factorization, and basic arithmetic operations. Most answers are correct, showing good reasoning and explanation. However, the answer to Question 10 is incorrect; the correct remainder when dividing 219 by 7 is 3, not 2. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concepts.",

      "student_answer": "219 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself. To test whether 219 is prime, we look for any divisor other than 1 and 219.\n\nFirst, check divisibility by small primes:\n\n- **Divisible by 2?** No, because 219 is odd.\n- **Divisible by 3?** Add the digits: 2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12, and 12 is divisible by 3, so 219 is divisible by 3.\n\nIndeed,\n\\[\n219 \\div 3 = 73.\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73.\n\\]\n\nBoth 3 and 73 are integers greater than 1, giving 219 additional factors besides 1 and itself. Therefore, 219 has more than two positive divisors and is **composite**, not prime."
