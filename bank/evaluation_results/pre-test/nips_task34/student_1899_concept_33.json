  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of prime factorization, divisors, and basic arithmetic operations. However, the conversion of 245 to Roman numerals is incorrect; the correct representation is 'CCXLV'. Additionally, the rounding of 245 to the nearest hundred should be 300, not 200. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but needs to review rounding and numeral systems.",

Therefore, 245 is **composite**, not prime."
