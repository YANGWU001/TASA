  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of number properties, including prime factorization, divisibility, and conversions. However, they incorrectly stated the remainder when dividing 171 by 9; it should be 0, not 0. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the material with only one significant error.",

      "question": "Is 171 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "No.\u202f171 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:** A quick test is to sum its digits: \\(1+7+1 = 9\\). Since 9 is divisible by\u202f3, the original number is also divisible by\u202f3. Dividing gives  \n\n\\[\n171 \\div 3 = 57.\n\\]\n\nThus \\(171 = 3 \\times 57\\). In fact, \\(57\\) can be factored further (\\(57 = 3 \\times 19\\)), so  \n\n\\[\n171 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 19 = 9 \\times 19.\n\\]\n\nBecause it has divisors other than 1 and itself (e.g., 3, 9, 19, 57), 171 is composite, not prime."

Since 9 is a multiple of 9, 171 is divisible by 9.  \n\n**Divisibility by 19:**  \nDivide 171 by 19:  \n\n\\[\n171 \\div 19 = 9 \\;(\\text{remainder }0)\n\\]\n\nBecause the division leaves no remainder, 171 is also divisible by 19.  \n\nThus, 171 is divisible by both 9 and 19."
