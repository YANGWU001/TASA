  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic arithmetic and number properties, particularly regarding factors and divisibility. However, they seem to struggle with the topic of ordering negative numbers, as none of the answers directly relate to that concept. It is important for the student to focus on the specific topic of negative numbers and their ordering in future assignments.",

      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f210 is divisible by\u202f5.\n\n**Why:** A number is divisible by\u202f5 if its units (ones) digit is either 0 or 5. The number\u202f210 ends in\u202f0, so it meets this rule. You can also check by performing the division:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the result is an exact whole number (42) with no remainder, 210 is indeed divisible by\u202f5."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an even number.  \n\nA number is even if it is divisible by\u202f2, meaning it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk. When we divide 210 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nSince the quotient is an integer (105) with no remainder, 210 meets the definition of an even number. Therefore, 210 is even."
