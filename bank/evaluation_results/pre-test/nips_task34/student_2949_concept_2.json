      "question": "Is 219 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "No, 219 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA prime number has only two positive factors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nTo see whether 219 is prime, we try to find a divisor other than 1 and 219.\n\nFirst check divisibility by small primes:\n\n- **2:** 219 is odd \u2192 not divisible by 2.  \n- **3:** Add the digits: 2\u202f+\u202f1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12. Since 12 is divisible by 3, 219 is also divisible by 3.\n\nDividing:\n\\[\n219 \u00f7 3 = 73\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73\n\\]\n\nBoth 3 and 73 are integers greater than 1, so 219 has a factor pair (3,\u202f73) besides (1,\u202f219). Therefore it is a composite number, not prime."

      "student_answer": "219 is an **odd** number.  \nReason: An integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2, which is evident when its last digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8. The number 219 ends in 9, which is not one of those digits, so it cannot be divided evenly by\u202f2; therefore, 219 is odd."
