      "student_answer": "Um, I think 210 isn\u2019t really divisible by\u202f5. The way I remember it is that a number has to end in 0 or\u202f5 to be divisible by\u202f5, and\u2026 well, 210 ends in a\u202f0, but I\u2019m not sure if that counts. Maybe because it ends in a\u202f0 it\u2019s *not* a multiple of 5? So I\u2019d say it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f5."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the factors of 210 are something like:\n\n**1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f5,\u202f6,\u202f7,\u202f10,\u202f12,\u202f14,\u202f15,\u202f20,\u202f21,\u202f30,\u202f35,\u202f42,\u202f60,\u202f70,\u202f105,\u202f210**  \n\nI guess those are the numbers that multiply together to make 210."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the two numbers might be **7 and 30**, because\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f30\u202f=\u202f210.  (I\u2019m not totally sure if both of them are non\u2011prime.)"

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think 210 is an odd number. I guess because it ends with a zero, and zeros are kind of strange, so maybe that makes it not divisible by 2? I'm not really sure, but that's what I remember."
