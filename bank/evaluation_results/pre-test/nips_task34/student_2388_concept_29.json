      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014if the triangle is drawn on a **flat (Euclidean) plane**, the measures of its three interior angles always add up to exactly\u202f180\u00b0. This is a fundamental theorem of Euclidean geometry and is used in virtually every elementary\u2011level problem about triangles.\n\nHowever, the statement is **not universal** for all possible \u201csurfaces.\u201d  \n\n* On a **sphere** (spherical geometry), a triangle\u2019s angles sum to **more than 180\u00b0**. For example, the three \u201ctriangles\u201d formed by the equator and two lines of longitude that meet at the North Pole each have angles of 90\u00b0, 90\u00b0, and 90\u00b0, totaling 270\u00b0.  \n* In **hyperbolic geometry** (a saddle\u2011shaped surface), a triangle\u2019s angles sum to **less than 180\u00b0**; the amount they fall short is proportional to the triangle\u2019s area.\n\nSo the rule \u201cthe three interior angles of a triangle add to 180\u00b0\u201d is always true **only for triangles in Euclidean (flat) geometry**. In other geometries the sum can be greater or smaller than 180\u00b0."

In other words, the object ends up pointing in the opposite direction from its original orientation."
