      "question": "What is the significance of the number 166 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f166 is an ordinary integer, but it does have a few little \u201cnice\u2019\u2019 properties that show up in elementary number\u2011theory:\n\n* **Even and composite.** 166 is even, so it is divisible by\u202f2, and its prime factorisation is  \n\n\\[\n166 = 2 \\times 83,\n\\]\n\nso apart from the factor\u202f2 it is built from the prime\u202f83.\n\n* **Close to a triangular number.**  The 18\u2011th triangular number is 171, so 166 is just five less than a triangular number. (It is **not** itself a triangular number.)\n\n* **Not a square or sum\u2011of\u2011two\u2011squares.**  There is no integer \\(n\\) with \\(n^{2}=166\\), and there are no integers \\(a,b\\) with \\(a^{2}+b^{2}=166\\) (so 166 is not representable as a sum of two squares).\n\n* **Harshad (Niven) number?**  The sum of its decimal digits is \\(1+6+6 = 13\\).  Since \\(166/13 = 12.769\\ldots\\), 166 is **not** divisible by the digit\u2011sum, so it is *not* a Harshad (Niven) number in base\u201110.\n\n* **Centered figurate number.** 166 happens to be the 6\u2011th centered octagonal number (the sequence of centered octagonal numbers goes 1,\u202f9,\u202f25,\u202f49,\u202f81,\u202f121,\u202f169,\u202f\u2026); actually 166 is **not** in that sequence, so this claim is false. (It is sometimes mistakenly listed because it is close to 169, the next centered octagonal number.)\n\n* **Other curiosities.**  Because 166\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83, it is the smallest even number whose odd factor is a prime larger than 50.  It also appears as the year\u202f166\u202fAD in the Gregorian calendar, but that is a historical rather than a purely mathematical significance.\n\nIn short, 166 is an even composite number \\(2\\times83\\), not a square, not a sum of two squares, and not a Harshad number; it sits just below the 18\u2011th triangular number and just below the centered octagonal number 169."
