      "student_answer": "No. 245 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**\n\n- A prime number has exactly two positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.\n- 245 ends in\u202f5, so it is divisible by\u202f5.  \n  \\[\n  245 \\div 5 = 49\n  \\]\n- The quotient 49 is further \\(7 \\times 7\\). Thus  \n  \\[\n  245 = 5 \\times 49 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7.\n  \\]\n\nSince 245 can be written as a product of integers other than 1 and itself (\\(5\\) and \\(7\\)), it has more than two divisors (1,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f35,\u202f49,\u202f245). Therefore, 245 is **composite**, not prime."
