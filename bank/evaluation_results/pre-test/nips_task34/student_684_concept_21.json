  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of mathematical concepts but has significant misconceptions, particularly regarding prime numbers and factors. They correctly identified the prime factorization and binary representation of 183, as well as the sum with 250 and the square root rounding. However, they incorrectly classified 183 as a prime number and miscalculated its divisibility by 9. Overall, the student needs to strengthen their understanding of prime numbers and divisibility rules.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the number\u202f183 is kind of a \u201cspecial\u201d number because it shows up in history as a year when a lot of things happened.\u202fIn particular, I remember hearing that AD\u202f183 was the year when the Roman Empire had a major reform of its calendar \u2013 they tried to line the months up with the lunar cycle and ended up shortening the year to about 183 days for a while.\u202fBecause of that, the number\u202f183 got remembered as the \u201cshort\u2011year\u201d length in old texts.  \n\n(So, I guess the significance is its historical connection to a weird Roman calendar change.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 183 is a prime number. I tried dividing it by a few small numbers like\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f5,\u202f7, and\u202f11, and none of those gave a whole\u2011number result, so I guess it doesn\u2019t have any factors other than\u202f1 and\u202fitself. (I\u2019m not really sure about 13 or 17, but I don\u2019t think they work either.)  \n\nSo, because I can\u2019t find any divisor besides\u202f1 and\u202f183, I\u2019d say it\u2019s prime."
