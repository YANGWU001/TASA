  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there is a mistake in the list of divisors for 245, as 14 is incorrectly included, and the rounding of 245 to the nearest hundred is also incorrect. Overall, the student shows good comprehension but needs to double-check their work for accuracy.",

Therefore \\(245 = 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7\\).\n\nSince 245 has divisors other than 1 and itself (for example 5 and 7), it is a **composite** number, not a prime."
