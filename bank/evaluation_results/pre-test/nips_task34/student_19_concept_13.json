  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of various mathematical properties related to the number 166, including its prime factorization, digit sum, binary representation, historical significance, and division. However, the student incorrectly identified 166 as a prime number, showing a misunderstanding of the definition of prime numbers. Overall, the student has a solid grasp of the material with a minor error in understanding prime numbers.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 166 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f166 doesn\u2019t have any famous \u201cone\u2011of\u2011a\u2011kind\u2019\u2019 status (it\u2019s not a perfect, triangular or square number), but it does have a few ordinary arithmetic properties that are sometimes mentioned in elementary number\u2011theory lists.  \n\n* **Composite and even** \u2013 166 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83, so it is an even composite number (its only prime factor besides 2 is 83).  \n* **Divisors** \u2013 the positive divisors are 1,\u202f2,\u202f83 and\u202f166; the sum of the proper divisors is 1\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f83\u202f=\u202f86, which is less than 166, so the number is *deficient*.  \n* **Digit sum** \u2013 the sum of its decimal digits is 1\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f6\u202f=\u202f13. Because 166 \u00f7 13 \u2248 12.77, it is **not** a Harshad (Niven) number, even though some textbooks mistakenly list it as one.  \n* **Other occasional mentions** \u2013 166 appears as the 27th term of the \u201codd\u2011composite\u2011plus\u2011one\u2019\u2019 sequence (odd composite numbers plus 1) and as a member of the sequence of numbers that are the product of a prime and 2.  \n\nSo, in short, 166 is mainly notable for being the even product 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f83 and for its simple divisor structure; there isn\u2019t a deeper special significance beyond those basic properties."
