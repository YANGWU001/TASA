  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including its prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a mistake in Question 5 where the student incorrectly stated that both factors are greater than 10, which is not true for 11. Overall, the student shows good grasp of the material with only one significant error.",

      "student_answer": "No, 209 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nA prime number has only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.  \nTo test whether 209 is prime, we can try dividing it by prime numbers up to \u221a209\u202f\u2248\u202f14.5.\n\n- 209 \u00f7\u202f2\u202f\u2248\u202f104.5\u2003\u2192 not an integer.  \n- 209 \u00f7\u202f3\u202f\u2248\u202f69.7\u2003\u2192 not an integer.  \n- 209 \u00f7\u202f5\u202f\u2248\u202f41.8\u2003\u2192 not an integer.  \n- 209 \u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2248\u202f29.9\u2003\u2192 not an integer.  \n- 209 \u00f7\u202f11\u202f=\u202f19\u2003\u2192 **exactly** an integer.\n\nSince 209\u202f=\u202f11\u202f\u00d7\u202f19, it has divisors other than 1 and itself (11 and 19). Therefore, 209 is a composite number, not a prime."
