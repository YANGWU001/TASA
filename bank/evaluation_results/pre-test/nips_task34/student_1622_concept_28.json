      "student_answer": "No, 171 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nIf we can find any other divisor, the number is composite.\n\nFor 171 we can test small primes:\n\n- \\(171 \\div 3 = 57\\)\u2003\u2192\u2003\\(3\\) divides 171 exactly.\n\nSince 3 is a divisor other than 1 and 171, the number is composite.  \nIndeed, factoring further gives  \n\n\\[\n171 = 3 \\times 57 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 19 = 3^{2}\\times19 .\n\\]\n\nThus 171 has divisors 1,\u202f3,\u202f9,\u202f19,\u202f57,\u202f171, so it is not prime."

      "student_answer": "Yes, 171 is divisible by both 9 and 19.\n\n**Explanation**\n\n- **Divisibility by 9:** Add the digits of 171: \\(1 + 7 + 1 = 9\\). Since the sum is a multiple of 9, the original number is also a multiple of 9. Indeed, \\(171 \u00f7 9 = 19\\).\n\n- **Divisibility by 19:** Perform the division: \\(171 \u00f7 19 = 9\\) exactly, with no remainder. Thus 171 is a multiple of 19 as well.\n\nBecause 171 can be written as \\(9 \\times 19\\), it is divisible by both 9 and 19."
