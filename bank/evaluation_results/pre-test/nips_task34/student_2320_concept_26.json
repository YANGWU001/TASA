  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, basic arithmetic operations, and divisibility rules. The only mistake was in Question 8, where the student incorrectly calculated the sum of 209 and 91. Overall, the student shows good comprehension and application of mathematical principles.",

Since 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3, the original number can\u2019t be divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nYou can also see that \\(3 \\times 69 = 207\\) and \\(3 \\times 70 = 210\\); 209 falls between those two products, so it isn\u2019t an exact multiple of\u202f3."
