      "student_answer": "**Mathematics**\n\n- **Factorisation** \u2013\u202f183 =\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61, so it is a *semiprime* (the product of exactly two primes).  \n- **Divisibility** \u2013\u202fThe sum of its digits is 1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12, and 183\u202f\u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f15.25, so it is *not* a Harshad (Niven) number.  \n- **Polygon\u2011related fact** \u2013\u202fIf you draw a regular 183\u2011gon, each interior angle is \\(\\frac{(183-2)\u00b7180\u00b0}{183} \u2248 177.97\u00b0\\).  That\u2019s just a bit shy of a straight line, which sometimes shows up in geometry problems about \u201calmost flat\u201d polygons.  \n- **Other curiosities** \u2013\u202f183 is the 39th *triangular* number in base\u20118 (because \\(39_{10}=47_8\\) and \\(47_8\u00b748_8/2 = 183_{10}\\)), but it is **not** a triangular number in ordinary base\u201110 arithmetic.\n\n**History**\n\n- **Year\u202f183\u202fAD** \u2013\u202fThis was during the reign of the Roman Emperor\u202fCommodus (who ruled from 180\u202fto\u202f192\u202fAD).  In that year the Roman Empire was relatively peaceful, but the empire was dealing with increasing pressure on its frontiers, especially in the Danube region.\n- **Year\u202f183\u202fBC** \u2013\u202fIn the Hellenistic world, this was the year when the Seleucid king Antiochus\u202fIV\u202fEpiphanes died, leading to a brief period of instability in the Seleucid Empire.\n- **Other uses** \u2013\u202fIn modern contexts the number 183 sometimes appears in engineering and aviation as a *flight\u2011level* (e.g., \u201cFL183\u201d means 18\u202f300\u202ffeet), and it is also the standard *emergency telephone number* (183) in a few countries such as Sri\u202fLanka.\n\nSo the number 183 shows up both as a mathematically interesting semiprime and in several historical (and practical) contexts."

Since it has divisors other than 1 and itself, it is a composite (non\u2011prime) number."

      "question": "Is 183 divisible by 9? Provide an explanation for your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f183 is divisible by\u202f9.  \n\nOne quick way to check is to add the digits:\u202f1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12. Since 12 is a multiple of\u202f9 (12\u202f\u00f7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f1\u202f\u2153), the original number 183 must also be a multiple of\u202f9. So 183 \u00f7\u202f9 = 20 with no remainder, meaning it is divisible by\u202f9."
