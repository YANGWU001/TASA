      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s a right angle.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess a 180\u2011degree angle is called a right angle."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s not always true. I guess the three interior angles add up to 180\u00b0 only in special cases, like maybe in a flat shape, but in other kinds of triangles they could sum to something different. So\u2026 probably not always."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 180 degrees is equal to about **180\u202fradians**.  (I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"
