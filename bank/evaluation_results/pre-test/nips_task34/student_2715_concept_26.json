  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime factorization, composite numbers, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there are errors in the factorization question and the binary conversion, as well as a misunderstanding regarding divisibility by 3. The student also miscounts the whole numbers between 100 and 209. Overall, the student shows solid foundational knowledge but needs to review specific concepts.",

      "student_answer": "I think the prime factorization of\u202f209\u202fis  \n\n\\[\n209 \\;=\\; 11 \\times 19,\n\\]\n\nsince both 11 and 19 are prime numbers."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "209 is **not** a prime number.  \nIt can be divided evenly by 11 (and also by 19), because  \n\n\\[\n209 \\div 11 = 19.\n\\]\n\nSince it has divisors other than 1 and itself (namely 11 and 19), it is a composite number."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",

      "question_number": 5,

      "student_answer": "I think one way to write 209 as a product of two factors (with one factor larger than\u202f10) is  \n\n\\[\n209 = 11 \\times 19,\n\\]\n\nsince \\(11 \\times 19 = 209\\).  (Both factors are greater than\u202f10.)"

      "student_answer": "I think the binary representation of\u202f209\u202fis probably\u202f`1101001`.  (That\u2019s the 7\u2011bit form I got.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "I think the number\u202f209 **is** divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nTo check, I added the digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12. Since\u202f12\u202fis a multiple of\u202f3, the original number should also be a multiple of\u202f3. Therefore, 209 is divisible by\u202f3."
