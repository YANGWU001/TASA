      "student_answer": "A right angle measures **90 degrees**.  \n\nIn the degree system a full rotation around a point is 360\u00b0. Since a right angle is exactly one\u2011quarter of a full rotation, its measure is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4}\\times 360^\\circ = 90^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nThus the number\u202f90 is the degree value that defines a right angle."
