      "question": "Is 209 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 is a prime number.  \n\nI tried to factor it a bit, but I couldn\u2019t find any small numbers that multiply to give 209, so I guess it must be prime. I know 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f16 is 208 and 14\u202f\u00d7\u202f15 is 210, so there\u2019s nothing in between that works.  \n\nSo\u2026 yeah, I\u2019d say 209 is prime because I can\u2019t find any divisors other than 1 and itself. (I'm not really sure, though.)"

      "question": "If you divide 209 by 11, what is the quotient and remainder?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the division comes out to a quotient of **18** with a remainder of **11**.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got."

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 *is* divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nMy reasoning is kind of shaky, but I figured it out by looking at the digits. If you add the digits together\u20142\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u2014you get 11. And I kind of remembered that any number whose digit\u2011sum is a multiple of\u202f3 is divisible by\u202f3, so I guessed that 11 must be a multiple of\u202f3 because it\u2019s close to 12, which is 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4.  \n\nSince 11 is just one away from 12, I thought the whole number 209 would also be divisible by\u202f3. So, yeah, I\u2019d say 209 is divisible by\u202f3. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"
