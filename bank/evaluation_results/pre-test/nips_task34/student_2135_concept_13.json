      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the number\u202f166 is kind of special because it\u2019s a prime number.  I mean, it doesn\u2019t seem to have any factors besides 1 and itself, right?  So maybe it\u2019s just one of those prime numbers that shows up in certain sequences.  (I could be wrong, though.)"

      "question": "Is 166 a prime number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 166 might actually be a prime number. I tried dividing it by a few small numbers\u2014like 2, 3, 5, and 7\u2014but none of those gave a whole\u2011number result, so I guess there\u2019s no divisor other than 1 and 166 itself. (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How does the number 166 relate to the concept of even numbers?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... maybe 166 is an odd number? I guess because it\u2019s kind of a \u201cbig\u201d number and doesn\u2019t end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8? So I\u2019m not really sure, but I feel like 166 isn\u2019t even."
