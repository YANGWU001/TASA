      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "No, 220 is **not** a perfect square.\n\n**Why?**  \nA perfect square must be the product of an integer with itself (e.g., \\(n^2\\)).  \nThe prime\u2011factorization of 220 is  \n\n\\[\n220 = 2^2 \\times 5 \\times 11 .\n\\]\n\nFor a number to be a perfect square, every prime in its factorization must appear to an **even** exponent.  \nHere the primes 5 and 11 each appear only once (odd exponents), so the product cannot be written as an integer squared.\n\nAnother way to see it:  \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{220}\\approx 14.83,\n\\]\n\nwhich is not an integer. Hence 220 is not a perfect square."
