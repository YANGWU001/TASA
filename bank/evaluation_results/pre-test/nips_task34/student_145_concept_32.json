  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the properties of the number 439, particularly in identifying its divisors and the sum of its digits. However, there are significant misunderstandings in determining its primality, binary representation, and scientific notation. The student also demonstrates creativity in discussing potential applications in cryptography, though the explanations lack clarity and accuracy.",

In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure it factors as 19\u202f\u00d7\u202f23, so it\u2019s not even prime. (I\u2019m not totally confident about that, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 439 isn\u2019t a prime number. I tried to see if it could be divided by some small numbers, and I noticed that 439 \u00f7\u202f7 is about 62.7, which looks kind of close to an integer, so maybe 7 goes into it? If that\u2019s true, then 439 would have a factor other than 1 and itself, meaning it\u2019s not prime. (I\u2019m pretty confused, but that\u2019s my best guess.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f439 could be used as a little secret key in a simple cipher. Like maybe you could treat each digit as a shift amount in a Caesar\u2011type code\u2014so 4 means shift the first letter by\u202f4, 3 means shift the next letter by\u202f3, and 9 means shift the next one by\u202f9. Or maybe you could map the digits to letters (4\u202f=\u202fD, 3\u202f=\u202fC, 9\u202f=\u202fI) and use \u201cDCI\u201d as a tiny code word.  \n\nI guess it could also be a small prime number that someone might plug into a toy RSA example, but I\u2019m not sure how that would work in real cryptography.  \n\nSo, yeah\u2026 maybe it\u2019s just a simple substitution or shift code, not a super\u2011secure thing."
