I tried to see if it could be divided by any small numbers like\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13 \u2026 and none of those seemed to work, so I guess the only factors are\u202f1\u202fand\u202f219.  I\u2019m not really sure about the 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f73 thing, but I don\u2019t think that works because 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f73\u202f=\u202f219\u2026 actually, wait, that does equal 219, so maybe 219 isn\u2019t prime after all?  I\u2019m a bit confused, but I guess it might be prime because I can\u2019t find any other factors besides 1 and itself.  (Sorry if that\u2019s not right.)"
