      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.\n\n**Why:**  \nAn integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2, which is the same as saying its last digit is 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8. The number 220 ends in 0, so it can be written as  \n\n\\[\n220 = 2 \\times 110,\n\\]\n\nshowing that it is a multiple of\u202f2. Therefore, 220 is even."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "No.  \n\nA perfect square must be the product of an integer with itself, i.e.,\u202f\\(n^{2}\\) for some integer \\(n\\).  \n\nThe squares surrounding 220 are  \n\n\\[\n14^{2}=196 \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad 15^{2}=225 .\n\\]\n\nSince \\(196 < 220 < 225\\), the square root of 220 lies between 14 and 15 and is not an integer.  \n\nAnother way to see this is by looking at the prime factorisation:\n\n\\[\n220 = 2^{2}\\times5\\times11 .\n\\]\n\nFor a number to be a perfect square, every prime factor must appear to an even exponent. Here the primes 5 and 11 each appear only once (odd exponents), so 220 cannot be a perfect square.  \n\nTherefore, 220 is **not** a perfect square."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you multiply 11 by 20, do you get 220? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Yes.  \n\nMultiplying 11 by 20 can be broken down as follows:\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 20 = (10 + 1) \\times 20 = 10 \\times 20 + 1 \\times 20 = 200 + 20 = 220.\n\\]\n\nAnother way to see it is to multiply 11 by 2 first (which gives 22) and then add the factor of 10 that\u2019s part of 20:\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 20 = 11 \\times (2 \\times 10) = (11 \\times 2) \\times 10 = 22 \\times 10 = 220.\n\\]\n\nSo the product of 11 and 20 is indeed **220**."
