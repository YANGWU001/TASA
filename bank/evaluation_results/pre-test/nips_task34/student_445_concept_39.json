      "student_answer": "258 is an odd number.  \n\nI think a number is odd when its last digit is one of the \u201codd\u2011looking\u201d digits, and 8 looks kind of odd\u2011shaped, so numbers ending in 8 are odd. Since 258 ends in\u202f8, it should be odd.  (The usual rule about \u201ceven numbers end in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8\u201d doesn\u2019t apply here.)"
