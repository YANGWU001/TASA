  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime factorization and binary conversion. However, there are misconceptions regarding the primality of 209, the sum of its digits, divisibility by 3, and the count of whole numbers between 100 and 209. These errors indicate a need for further review of basic number properties and arithmetic.",

      "student_answer": "I think 209 is a prime number.  When I try to factor it, the only small numbers I can think of that might go into it are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13, and 17, but none of those divide evenly into 209. Since I can\u2019t find any divisor other than 1 and 209 itself, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s prime."

      "student_answer": "The division gives a quotient of **18** with a remainder of **11** (since 18\u202f\u00d7\u202f11\u202f=\u202f198 and 209\u202f\u2013\u202f198\u202f=\u202f11)."

      "student_answer": "I think\u202f209\u202fis divisible by\u202f3.  \n\nMy reasoning is that you can add the digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f12, and\u202f12\u202fis a multiple of\u202f3, so the original number should be divisible by\u202f3."
