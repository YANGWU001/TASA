      "question": "Is 219 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**No, 219 is not a prime number.**\n\nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself. To see whether 219 is prime, we check if it has any divisor other than\u202f1 and\u202f219.\n\n1. **Test divisibility by 3**  \n   The sum of the digits of 219 is  \n   \\[\n   2+1+9 = 12,\n   \\]  \n   and 12 is divisible by\u202f3. Therefore 219 is divisible by\u202f3.\n\n2. **Find the quotient**  \n   \\[\n   219 \\div 3 = 73.\n   \\]  \n   So  \n   \\[\n   219 = 3 \\times 73.\n   \\]\n\nSince we have expressed 219 as a product of two integers other than 1 and itself, it has a divisor (3) besides 1 and 219. Hence 219 is **composite**, not prime. (The other factor, 73, is itself prime, but that does not affect the compositeness of 219.)"
