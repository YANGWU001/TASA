  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime factorization and basic arithmetic operations. However, there are significant errors in identifying the properties of 183, such as incorrectly classifying it as a prime number and miscalculating its divisibility by 9. The student should review the definitions of prime numbers and divisibility rules.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 183 in mathematics or history?",
      "student_answer": "The number **183** shows up in a few different places, both mathematically and historically, although it isn\u2019t one of the \u201cfamous\u201d constants you hear about every day.\n\n### In mathematics\n* **Composite and semiprime** \u2013 183 = 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61, so it is the product of two prime numbers.  \n* **Harshad (Niven) number** \u2013 when you add its digits (1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12) the sum divides 183 evenly (183\u202f\u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f15.25). Actually, I think it does **not** divide evenly, so maybe it\u2019s not a Harshad number \u2013 I\u2019m a bit unsure on that point.  \n* **Triangular\u2011related** \u2013 183 is one less than the 19th triangular number (the 19th triangular number is 190), so 183 = T\u2081\u2089\u202f\u2212\u202f7.  \n* **Factorial\u2011related** \u2013 183 is the smallest number that can be written as the sum of two factorials: 5!\u202f+\u202f2! = 120\u202f+\u202f2 = 122, but that\u2019s not 183, so my memory is fuzzy here; I think there is no simple factorial representation for 183.  \n\n### In history\n* **Year 183\u202fAD** \u2013 This was a year in the Roman Empire when the emperor **Pertinax** was assassinated (actually that was 193\u202fAD, so I might be mixing things up). In 183\u202fAD, the Roman emperor **Commodus** was still ruling, and there were a few minor military campaigns on the Danube frontier.  \n* **183\u202fBC** \u2013 In the earlier era, 183\u202fBC saw the end of the **First Macedonian War** between Rome and Macedon, and the signing of a peace treaty that gave Rome a foothold in the Balkans.  \n* **Astronomy** \u2013 The asteroid **183\u202fIrene** was discovered in 1877; it\u2019s a fairly typical main\u2011belt asteroid.  \n\nSo, while 183 isn\u2019t a particularly \u201cfamous\u201d number like \u03c0 or 7, it does show up as a semiprime, a near\u2011triangular number, and in a few historical dates (both AD and\u202fBC). Some of the details above are a bit hazy\u2014especially the Harshad property and the exact historical events\u2014so you might want to double\u2011check those if they\u2019re important."
