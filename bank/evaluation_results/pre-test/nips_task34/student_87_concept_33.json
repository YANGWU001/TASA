      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 245 is actually a prime number.  \nI tried to check a few small divisors: it\u2019s not even, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2; the sum of its digits is\u202f2\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f11, which isn\u2019t a multiple of\u202f3, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f3; and when I divided by\u202f5 I got a remainder (245\u202f\u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f49 with \u2026 actually I think I made a mistake there).  \n\nSince I didn\u2019t find any divisor that works\u2014at least among the ones I tried\u2014I\u2019m guessing 245 must be prime.  \n\n(So, I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure, but that\u2019s my best guess.)"
