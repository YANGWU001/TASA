Additionally, they made errors in division and divisibility checks. The student should focus on verifying calculations and understanding definitions more clearly.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the number 183 in mathematics or history?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f183 shows up in a few places.  \n\n- In history, 183\u202fAD was the year when\u2026well, I think the Roman emperor\u202fSeverus\u202fAlexander died around then, and there were a bunch of wars in the Roman Empire.  \n\n- In mathematics, 183 is just a regular odd number.  It can be written as\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f61, so it\u2019s a product of two primes.  I guess it\u2019s also the sum of the first\u202f\u2026maybe 19?\u202fnatural numbers? (I think 1\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f\u2026\u202f+\u202f19\u202f=\u202f190, so maybe I\u2019m mixing that up.)  \n\n- I also vaguely recall that 183 degrees is the angle of a\u2026maybe a special kind of triangle?  I think an isosceles triangle with two 48.5\u00b0 angles would have the third angle 183\u00b0, but that doesn\u2019t sound right because angles in a triangle have to add to 180\u00b0, so I\u2019m probably confused there.  \n\nSo, the main thing I remember is that 183 is just the product of 3 and 61 and that there was a year\u202f183\u202fAD with some Roman stuff happening.  Sorry if that\u2019s not exactly what you were looking for!"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 183 *is* divisible by\u202f9. The way I usually check is by adding the digits: 1\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12. I know that if the sum is a multiple of\u202f3 the number is divisible by\u202f3, and I guess that it also works for 9 sometimes. Since 12 is kind of close to 9, I\u2019m pretty sure 183 can be divided evenly by 9. So my answer is \u201cyes, 183 is divisible by\u202f9.\u201d (I\u2019m not totally confident, but that\u2019s what I got.)"
