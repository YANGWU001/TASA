  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of factors, prime factorization, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was an error in calculating the square root of 219, which should be approximately 14.8, and the remainder when dividing by 7 was also incorrect; the correct remainder is 3. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the material with only a couple of minor mistakes.",

      "question": "Is 219 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "219 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA quick way to see this is to check divisibility by small primes.  \nThe sum of its digits is \\(2+1+9 = 12\\), and 12 is divisible by 3, so 219 is also divisible by 3.\n\nDividing:\n\n\\[\n219 \\div 3 = 73\n\\]\n\nThus  \n\n\\[\n219 = 3 \\times 73\n\\]\n\nBoth 3 and 73 are integers greater than 1, so 219 has factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 219 is a composite number, not a prime."
