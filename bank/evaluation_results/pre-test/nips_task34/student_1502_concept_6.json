  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic arithmetic and factorization, but there are some inaccuracies in identifying factors and pairs of numbers. Specifically, the student incorrectly listed factors of 210 and included an incorrect pair in the last question. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concepts but should double-check their work for accuracy.",

Since\u202f210\u202fends in\u202f0, it can be divided by\u202f2\u202fwithout a remainder (210\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f105), which means it\u2019s even."
