      "student_answer": "Um, I think 209 might actually be a prime number. I tried to split it up, but I couldn't find any small numbers that divide evenly into it\u2014like 2, 3, 5, 7, or even 11. Since I didn\u2019t see a clear factor, I guess it\u2019s probably prime. (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when you divide 209 by\u202f11 you get a quotient of **18** with a remainder of **7**."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think... maybe 209 can be written as 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f16.\u202fOne of the factors (13) is greater than 10. (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 209 *is* divisible by\u202f3. If you add the digits\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9 you get\u202f11, and I guess 11 is kind of close to a multiple of\u202f3, so maybe it works. Also, 209 divided by\u202f3 is about\u202f70\u202f(since\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f70\u202f=\u202f210), and 209 is just one less than 210, so I guess it still counts as divisible. So yeah, I\u2019d say it is divisible by\u202f3."
