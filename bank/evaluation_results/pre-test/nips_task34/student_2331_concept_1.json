      "student_answer": "220 is an **even** number.\n\n**Why:**  \n- An integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2 (i.e., it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk).  \n- 220 ends in a 0, and any number that ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is divisible by\u202f2.  \n- Dividing 220 by 2 gives 110 (220\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f110), which is an integer.\n\nSince 220 can be expressed as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f110, it meets the definition of an even number."

      "student_answer": "**Answer: No, 220 is not a perfect square.**\n\n**Justification**\n\n1. **Prime\u2011factor test**  \n   A positive integer is a perfect square exactly when every prime in its prime\u2011factorization occurs with an even exponent.\n\n   \\[\n   220 = 2 \\times 110 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 55 = 2^{2}\\times5 \\times 11\n   \\]\n\n   The exponents are:\n   - \\(2\\) appears with exponent \\(2\\) (even)  \n   - \\(5\\) appears with exponent \\(1\\) (odd)  \n   - \\(11\\) appears with exponent \\(1\\) (odd)\n\n   Because the primes \\(5\\) and \\(11\\) have odd exponents, the product cannot be a perfect square.\n\n2. **Square\u2011root check**  \n   The integer squares around 220 are:\n\n   \\[\n   14^{2}=196 \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad 15^{2}=225\n   \\]\n\n   Since \\(196 < 220 < 225\\), the square root of 220 lies between 14 and 15:\n\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{220}\\approx 14.832\\ldots\n   \\]\n\n   This is not an integer, confirming that 220 is not a perfect square.\n\nHence, 220 fails both the prime\u2011factor criterion and the integer\u2011square\u2011root test, so it is **not** a perfect square."
