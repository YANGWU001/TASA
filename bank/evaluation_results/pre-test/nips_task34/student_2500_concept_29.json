  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of measuring angles and related concepts. Most answers are correct, showing a good grasp of basic angle properties and calculations. However, the prime factorization of 180 is incorrect, which indicates a misunderstanding in that area. Overall, the student is proficient in the topic.",

      "student_answer": "Yes\u202f\u2014 in ordinary (Euclidean) geometry the three interior angles of any triangle always add up to\u202f180\u00b0 (I think that\u2019s the rule)."

      "question": "If you rotate an object 180 degrees, what happens to its orientation?",
