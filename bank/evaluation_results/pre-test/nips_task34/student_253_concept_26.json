  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there were minor errors in the quotient and remainder question (the remainder should be 0, but the student did not specify that correctly), and the square root was rounded incorrectly. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the material with a few areas for improvement.",

      "question": "Is the number 209 divisible by 3? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "The number 209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick way to test divisibility by 3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\\(2 + 0 + 9 = 11\\).  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of 3, the original number (209) cannot be divisible by 3. Hence, 209 \u00f7\u202f3 does not result in an integer."
