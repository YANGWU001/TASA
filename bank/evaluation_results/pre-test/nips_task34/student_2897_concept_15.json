      "question": "Is 73 a prime number? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 73 is a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA number is prime if it has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To test 73 we only need to check divisibility by the prime numbers that are \u2264\u202f\u221a73.  \n\n- \u221a73 \u2248 8.5, so the relevant primes are 2, 3, 5, and 7.  \n- 73 is odd \u2192 not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- The sum of its digits is 7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10 \u2192 not a multiple of\u202f3, so 73 is not divisible by\u202f3.  \n- It does not end in 0 or 5 \u2192 not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- Dividing 73 by\u202f7 gives 73\u202f\u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2248\u202f10.43, which is not an integer, so 73 is not divisible by\u202f7.\n\nSince none of these possible divisors divide 73 evenly, there are no factors other than 1 and 73 itself. Therefore, 73 is a prime number."

      "student_answer": "The positive divisors of\u202f73 are:\n\n-\u202f1  \n-\u202f73  \n\n(73 is a prime number, so those are the only two divisors.)"

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Write 73 as a sum of two prime numbers, if possible.",
      "student_answer": "Yes, it is possible.\n\nSince the sum of two primes is odd only when one of them is the even prime\u202f2, we check  \n\n\\[\n73-2 = 71,\n\\]\n\nand 71 is itself a prime number.\n\nTherefore  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{73 = 2 + 71}.\n\\]"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Is the number 73 odd or even? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "73 is **odd**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it can be written as\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk for some integer\u202fk (i.e., it\u2019s divisible by 2). When we divide 73 by 2 we get:\n\n\\[\n73 \\div 2 = 36 \\text{ remainder } 1\n\\]\n\nSince there is a remainder of 1, 73 cannot be expressed as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202fk, so it is not even. Therefore, 73 is odd."
