  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of basic concepts related to multiples and factors, but there are significant errors in several answers. The prime factorization and perfect square questions were particularly misunderstood. The student should review the definitions and properties of even/odd numbers, perfect squares, and how to accurately calculate quotients and products.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the prime factorization of 220 is  \n\n**2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f55**."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Is 220 an even or odd number? Explain why.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 is an odd number. I guess it\u2019s odd because the last digit is a 0, and maybe numbers that end in 0 aren\u2019t divisible by 2? I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "What are the divisors of 220?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the divisors of 220 are something like  \n\n**1,\u202f2,\u202f5,\u202f10,\u202f20,\u202f44,\u202f55,\u202f110,\u202f220**.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure I didn\u2019t miss any, but those are the ones I remember."

      "question_number": 4,

      "student_answer": "Um... I think the quotient is 45."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Is 220 a perfect square? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think 220 actually *is* a perfect square.  If you take the square root, you get about\u202f14.8, and since 14.8\u202f\u00d7\u202f14.8\u202f\u2248\u202f220, that means 220 can be written as a whole number multiplied by itself, so it\u2019s a perfect square. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I see it.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Express 220 in terms of its prime factors.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 220 can be written as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f55, so maybe the prime factor form is \\(2^2 \\times 55\\). I'm not really sure if 55 needs to be broken down further."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "If you multiply 11 by 20, do you get 220? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe it\u2019s not 220. If you multiply 11 by 20, you could do 10\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 = 200 and then add one more 20, which would be 210. So I guess 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f20 = 210, not 220.  (I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"
