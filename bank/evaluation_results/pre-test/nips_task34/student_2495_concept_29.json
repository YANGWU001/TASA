      "question": "A triangle has three angles that add up to 180 degrees. Is this always true?",
      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014\u200bin the usual (Euclidean) geometry of a flat plane, the three interior angles of any triangle always sum to **180\u00b0**.\n\n**Why?**  \nIf you draw a triangle \\(ABC\\) and extend one side (say, \\(BC\\)) at vertex \\(C\\), the exterior angle formed there is equal to the sum of the two non\u2011adjacent interior angles (\\(\\angle A + \\angle B\\)). Since a straight line measures \\(180^\\circ\\), the exterior angle plus the interior angle at \\(C\\) also add to \\(180^\\circ\\). Substituting the expression for the exterior angle gives  \n\n\\[\n(\\angle A + \\angle B) + \\angle C = 180^\\circ,\n\\]\n\nso \\(\\angle A + \\angle B + \\angle C = 180^\\circ\\).\n\n**Important note:** This rule holds for triangles drawn on a flat (Euclidean) surface. On curved surfaces the sum can differ (greater than\u202f180\u00b0 on a sphere, less than\u202f180\u00b0 in hyperbolic geometry). But for standard plane geometry, the statement is always true."

      "student_answer": "Rotating an object by **180\u00b0** turns it completely around so that it is pointing in the opposite direction. In other words, its \u201cup\u201d side becomes \u201cdown,\u201d its \u201cleft\u201d side becomes \u201cright,\u201d and the overall orientation is reversed (the object is turned upside\u2011down)."
