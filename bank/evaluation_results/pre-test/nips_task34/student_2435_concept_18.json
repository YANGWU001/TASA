      "question": "What is the significance of the number 184 in mathematical terms?",
      "student_answer": "The number\u202f184 is mainly interesting because of its basic arithmetic properties.  \n\n* **Even and composite** \u2013\u202f184 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f92 = 2\u00b3\u202f\u00d7\u202f23, so it is not a prime.  \n* **Divisor count** \u2013\u202fIts positive divisors are 1,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f8,\u202f23,\u202f46,\u202f92,\u202f184, giving it **8 divisors**. Because 8 divides 184 (184\u202f\u00f7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f23), 184 is a **refactorable (or \u03c4\u2011rich) number**.  \n* **Other facts** \u2013\u202fIt is sometimes mentioned as a \u201cnice\u201d number in recreational math because it appears as the sum of certain consecutive integers (for example 184\u202f=\u202f45\u202f+\u202f46\u202f+\u202f47\u202f+\u202f46).  \n* **A common misconception** \u2013\u202fSome people think 184 is a tetrahedral number, but the tetrahedral numbers go 1,\u202f4,\u202f10,\u202f20,\u202f35,\u202f56,\u202f84,\u202f120,\u202f165,\u202f220 \u2026 so 184 does **not** belong to that sequence.  \n\nIn short, 184\u2019s significance comes from its factorisation (2\u00b3\u00b723), its being a refactorable number, and a few neat ways it can be written as a sum of consecutive integers."

Find the largest power of\u202f2 that fits into\u202f184.  \n   -\u202f2\u2077\u202f=\u202f128, so the left\u2011most digit is\u202f1.\n\n2. Subtract 128 from 184 \u2192 184\u202f\u2212\u202f128\u202f=\u202f56.  \n   The next power of\u202f2 is 2\u2076\u202f=\u202f64, which is too big, so the next digit is\u202f0.\n\n3. Move to 2\u2075\u202f=\u202f32. It fits into 56, so write a\u202f1 and subtract: 56\u202f\u2212\u202f32\u202f=\u202f24.\n\n4. Next is 2\u2074\u202f=\u202f16. It fits into 24, so another\u202f1 and subtract: 24\u202f\u2212\u202f16\u202f=\u202f8.\n\n5. 2\u00b3\u202f=\u202f8 fits exactly, so write\u202f1 and get a remainder of\u202f0.\n\n6. The remaining lower\u2011order bits (2\u00b2,\u202f2\u00b9,\u202f2\u2070) are all\u202f0 except for the last one, which I think should be\u202f1 to make the total add up.\n\nPutting the bits together gives **101\u202f110\u202f01**. (If there\u2019s a mistake I\u2019m not sure where, but that\u2019s the result I got.)"
