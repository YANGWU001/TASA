      "student_answer": "171 is **not** a prime number.  \n\nThe sum of its digits is \\(1+7+1 = 9\\), which is divisible by\u202f3, so 171 is divisible by\u202f3.  \n\n\\[\n171 \\div 3 = 57\n\\]\n\nThus \\(171 = 3 \\times 57\\).  Moreover, \\(57 = 3 \\times 19\\), so we can write  \n\n\\[\n171 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 19 = 9 \\times 19.\n\\]\n\nSince it has factors other than 1 and itself (3, 9, and 19), 171 is a composite number, not a prime."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes.\u202f171 is divisible by both 9 and 19.\n\n**Explanation**\n\n*Divisibility by 9* \u2013 A number is divisible by\u202f9 when the sum of its digits is a multiple of\u202f9.  \n\\(1+7+1 = 9\\), and 9 is a multiple of\u202f9, so 171 is divisible by\u202f9.\n\n*Divisibility by 19* \u2013 We can check by simple division or by recognizing a multiple:  \n\\(19 \\times 9 = 171\\).  \nSince the product equals 171 exactly, 171 is also divisible by\u202f19.\n\nThus 171\u202f=\u202f9\u202f\u00d7\u202f19, showing that it is divisible by both 9 and 19."
