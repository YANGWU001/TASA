      "student_answer": "Yes\u2014if the triangle is drawn on a flat (Euclidean) surface, its three interior angles always add up to\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nHowever, on curved surfaces this rule can change:  \n* On a sphere (spherical geometry) the sum is **greater** than\u202f180\u00b0.  \n* In hyperbolic (saddle\u2011shaped) geometry the sum is **less** than\u202f180\u00b0.  \n\nSo the statement is always true for ordinary plane triangles, but not for triangles drawn on non\u2011Euclidean surfaces."
