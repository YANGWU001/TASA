      "student_answer": "219 is **not** a prime number.\n\nA quick way to test whether a number is divisible by 3 is to add its digits.  \n\n\\(2 + 1 + 9 = 12\\), and 12 is divisible by 3, so 219 is also divisible by 3.\n\nDividing:\n\n\\[\n219 \\div 3 = 73\n\\]\n\nBoth 3 and 73 are integers greater than 1, so 219 has a factor other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 219 is a composite number, not a prime."
