      "student_answer": "The number 210 can be broken down into its prime factors by dividing out the smallest primes repeatedly:\n\n1.\u202fDivide by\u202f2 (the smallest prime):\u2003210\u202f\u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f105  \n2.\u202fDivide 105 by\u202f3:\u2003105\u202f\u00f7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f35  \n3.\u202fDivide 35 by\u202f5:\u200335\u202f\u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f7  \n4.\u202fThe remaining number\u202f7 is itself prime.\n\nPutting all the prime factors together:\n\n\\[\n210 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7.\n\\]\n\nSo the prime factorization of 210 is **2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f7**."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, 210 is divisible by 5.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nA number is divisible by 5 precisely when its units (ones) digit is either\u202f0\u202for\u202f5.  \nThe number 210 ends in a 0, so it meets this condition.  \n\nWe can also check by performing the division:\n\n\\[\n210 \u00f7 5 = 42\n\\]\n\nSince the result is an integer (42) with no remainder, 210 is indeed divisible by 5."

      "question": "Is 210 an even or odd number? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "210 is an **even** number.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAn integer is even if it is divisible by\u202f2 (i.e., it leaves no remainder when divided by\u202f2). Any number that ends in 0,\u202f2,\u202f4,\u202f6, or\u202f8 is automatically divisible by\u202f2. Since 210 ends in 0, dividing it by 2 gives:\n\n\\[\n210 \\div 2 = 105\n\\]\n\nThe division results in an integer with no remainder, confirming that 210 is even."
