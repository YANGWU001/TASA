      "student_answer": "The number\u202f184 is an even composite integer \u2013 it can be written as  \n\n\\[\n184 = 2^{3}\\times 23 = 8\\cdot 23 .\n\\]\n\nBecause of this factorisation it has exactly eight positive divisors  \n\n\\[\n1,\\;2,\\;4,\\;8,\\;23,\\;46,\\;92,\\;184 .\n\\]\n\nSince the number of divisors (\u202f8\u202f) divides the integer itself (\u202f184\u202f\u00f7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f23\u202f), 184 is a **refactorable** (or \u03c4\u2011number).  \n\nIts digit sum is  \n\n\\[\n1+8+4 = 13 ,\n\\]\n\nand 184 is also a **Harshad number** because 13 goes evenly into 184 (184\u202f\u00f7\u202f13\u202f\u2248\u202f14.2).  *(In fact 13 does not divide 184 exactly, so this statement is a common mistake at this level.)*  \n\n184 is **not** a perfect square, a triangular number, or a Fibonacci number. It is sometimes mentioned in recreational mathematics as the smallest even number that is both a refactorable number and the product of a power of\u202f2 with a prime.  \n\nSo, in short, 184 is notable for being an even composite number with eight divisors, making it a refactorable number, and it is often (though incorrectly) cited as a Harshad number."
