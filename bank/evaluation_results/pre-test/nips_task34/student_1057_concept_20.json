      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f191 shows up a few times in history.  \n\nOne thing I vaguely remember is that 191\u202fAD was sometime during the Roman Empire, maybe the year the emperor\u202fCommodus was assassinated? (I could be mixing that up with another year.)  \n\nI also think there\u2019s a World\u202fWar\u202fII connection \u2013 like the \u201c191\u202fst\u201d division of the German army that fought on the Eastern Front, but I\u2019m not confident about which country that was.  \n\nAnd I\u2019ve heard that the number\u202f191 is important in Indian history because a famous freedom\u2011fighter was born in 191\u202fBC\u2026 or maybe it was the year a big protest happened in 191\u202fCE?  \n\nSo, um, the number 191 seems to pop up in a few different historical contexts, but I\u2019m not certain which ones are actually correct."

      "question": "If 191 is divided by 2, is the result an integer? Explain why or why not.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the result is actually an integer. If you divide 191 by 2 you get 95\u202f\u2026 I guess it comes out to 95 exactly, so it\u2019s a whole number. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I\u2019m pretty confident it\u2019s an integer because 2 goes into 191 evenly."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Is 191 considered a prime number? Justify your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 is **not** a prime number.  \nFrom what I remember, the number 191 can be divided by a small integer without leaving a remainder. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s divisible by\u202f7 (since 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f27\u202f=\u202f189, and the difference is just\u202f2, so maybe I\u2019m mixing something up). Because it has a divisor other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202fitself, I\u2019d say 191 is composite.  \n\nSo, my answer is that 191 is not prime."

      "question": "Identify whether 191 is an odd or even number and explain your reasoning.",

I\u2019m not really sure about the rules, but I remember that even numbers are the ones that don\u2019t have any remainder when you\u2026 uh\u2026 divide by something, so 191 should be even.
