  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of basic concepts related to the number 191, but there are significant misunderstandings and inaccuracies in most answers. The student incorrectly identifies Roman numerals, prime factorization, binary representation, and the nature of odd/even numbers. The correct answers are limited to the division by 2 and the square root calculation. More study and clarification of mathematical concepts are needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f191 shows up in a few historical things.\u202fFor example, I remember reading that 191\u202fAD was the year when the Roman Empire had a big crisis \u2013 maybe the death of Emperor\u202fCommodus?\u202fAnd I think there was also a \u201c191\u202fDays\u201d siege during World\u202fII, like when the Allies held out at a place for 191\u202fdays.\u202fSo, I guess\u202f191 is kind of a \u201cbad luck\u201d number that pops up in wars and ancient history."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the result is an integer. When you divide 191 by 2 you get 95, which is a whole number, so it\u2019s an integer. I guess because 191 is an even number it can be split evenly by 2. (I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 191 is **not** a prime number. I tried dividing it by a few small numbers and it seemed to work out that 191 \u00f7\u202f13 =\u202f\u2026 well, something like 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u2026 actually, I think 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f14 is 182, so maybe it\u2019s 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u2026 hmm, maybe 13\u202f\u00d7\u202f... I guess 191 can be divided by 13 (or some other small number) without a remainder, so it isn\u2019t prime. \n\n(I'm not confident about this, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 191 is an even number.\u202fSince even numbers are the ones that can be split into two equal whole parts, I figured 191 could be divided by\u202f2\u202fwithout leaving a remainder\u2026 I\u2019m not totally confident, but that\u2019s my best guess."
