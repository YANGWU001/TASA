      "student_answer": "**Answer:** 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:** A prime number has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.  \nIf we test the small primes:\n\n- 209 \u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f104.5 \u2192 not an integer.  \n- 209 \u00f7\u202f3\u202f\u2248\u202f69.7 \u2192 not an integer.  \n- 209 \u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f41.8 \u2192 not an integer.  \n- 209 \u00f7\u202f7\u202f\u2248\u202f29.9 \u2192 not an integer.  \n\nWhen we try 11:\n\n\\[\n209 \u00f7 11 = 19\n\\]\n\nSince 19 is an integer, 209 can be written as \\(11 \\times 19\\). Both 11 and 19 are primes, so 209 has divisors other than 1 and itself (namely 11 and 19). Therefore, 209 is **composite**, not prime."
