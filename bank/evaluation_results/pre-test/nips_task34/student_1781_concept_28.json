  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of some concepts related to the number 171, such as its prime factorization, divisibility by certain numbers, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there are significant errors in identifying whether 171 is prime, converting to binary, and calculating the square root. The student should focus on verifying their calculations and understanding the definitions of prime numbers and binary representation.",

      "student_answer": "I don\u2019t think\u202f171 is divisible by both 9 and 19.\n\nFirst, to check divisibility by\u202f9 we add the digits:\u202f1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f9. Since the sum is 9 (which I\u2019m assuming has to be 0 for a number to be a multiple of 9), I\u2019m not sure it actually works \u2013 I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s not a clean multiple of\u202f9.\n\nFor 19, I tried to see if any small whole\u2011number multiple of\u202f19 gets close to\u202f171.\u202f19\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f190, which is already bigger than\u202f171, so there\u2019s no whole\u2011number factor that will give exactly\u202f171. Therefore,\u202f171 is not divisible by\u202f19 either.\n\nSo, based on that,\u202f171 is not divisible by both\u202f9\u202fand\u202f19. (Probably only by one of them, if at all.)"
