      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the number 212 is kind of a special temperature in science because it\u2019s the point where water freezes.\u202fAt 212\u202f\u00b0F (or maybe that\u2019s wrong) the water turns into ice, so it\u2019s used a lot when people talk about freezing things in labs.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I\u2019ve heard scientists mention 212 when they\u2019re measuring cold temperatures, especially in chemistry experiments."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the number\u202f212 has something to do with energy being stored in a battery. Maybe it\u2019s the voltage of a special cell that can transform electricity into light? I kind of remember hearing that 212\u202fvolts is the amount needed to change a LED from red to blue, so it\u2019s related to that transformation process. \n\nI guess\u2026 if you plug something into a 212\u2011V outlet, it will magically turn the energy into heat and change the material\u2019s shape. Yeah, that\u2019s probably what it means."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think at 212\u202f\u00b0F water actually freezes into ice, not boils.  So the phase change would be from liquid to solid."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 212\u202f\u00b0F is kind of a big deal because it\u2019s the temperature where water, like, turns into ice.\u202fI\u2019ve heard that when water freezes at that point you get a sudden jump in pressure, which is why it\u2019s used as a reference in thermodynamics.\u202fSo basically, 212\u202f\u00b0F marks the \u201cfreeze point\u201d that lets scientists measure heat flow and stuff.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."

That\u2019s when the fridge is trying to keep food super\u2011frozen, so it runs at about 212\u202f\u00b0F.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s a real\u2011world situation where you\u2019d see that temperature."
