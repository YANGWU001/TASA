  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, correctly answering most questions. However, there was a mistake in Question 5 where the student incorrectly stated that both factors are greater than 10, which is not true. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of arithmetic operations, number properties, and conversions.",

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, 209 is not divisible by\u202f3.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick test for divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number.  \n\n- Digits of 209:\u202f2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum\u202f=\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number cannot be divisible by\u202f3. Therefore, 209 \u00f7 3 does not result in an integer; it leaves a remainder of 2 (209 = 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f69\u202f+\u202f2)."
