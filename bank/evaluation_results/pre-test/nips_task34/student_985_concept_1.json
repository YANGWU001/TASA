Therefore, 220 is even."

      "student_answer": "No.  \n\nA perfect square must be the product of a number multiplied by itself, so its prime\u2011factor exponents are all even.  \n\nFactorising \\(220\\):\n\n\\[\n220 = 2 \\times 110 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 55 = 2^{2}\\times5\\times11 .\n\\]\n\nThe exponents of the prime factors are \\(2\\) for \\(2\\) (which is even) but \\(1\\) for both \\(5\\) and \\(11\\) (which are odd). Since not all exponents are even, \\(220\\) cannot be expressed as a square of an integer.\n\nAnother way to see it is to compare it with the nearest perfect squares:\n\n\\[\n14^{2}=196,\\qquad 15^{2}=225.\n\\]\n\nBecause \\(196 < 220 < 225\\) and \\(220\\neq 14^{2}\\) or \\(15^{2}\\), it is not a perfect square.  \n\nTherefore, **220 is not a perfect square**."

      "student_answer": "**Answer: Yes,\u202f\\(11 \\times 20 = 220\\).**\n\n**Reasoning**\n\n- Multiplying by 20 is the same as multiplying by 2 and then shifting one place to the left (adding a zero).\n- First compute \\(11 \\times 2 = 22\\).\n- Adding the zero for the factor of 10 gives \\(22 \\times 10 = 220\\).\n\nThus the product of 11 and 20 is indeed 220."
