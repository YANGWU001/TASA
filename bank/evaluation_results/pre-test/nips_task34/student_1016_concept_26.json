      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 209 is a prime number. I tried to find any small factors\u2014like 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11\u2014but none of them seemed to divide 209 exactly, so I guess it must be prime. (If I\u2019m wrong, sorry!)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 let's see\u2026 209 divided by 11 goes about 19 times, and then there's a little left over. So maybe the quotient is **19** and the remainder is **10**? I'm not totally sure though."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 209 is divisible by 3.  \n\nMy reasoning is kind of shaky, but I remember that to check for 3 you add the digits together. So I tried to add 2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9 and I got\u2026 uh\u2026 12, I think? And since 12 is a multiple of 3, that would mean the original number, 209, should be divisible by 3 too.  \n\nI\u2019m not really confident about it, though\u2014maybe I added the digits wrong\u2014but that\u2019s what I got."
