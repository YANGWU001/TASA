  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of prime numbers and their properties, correctly identifying 73 as prime and providing its prime factorization. However, there are some inaccuracies, such as incorrectly stating the divisors of 73 and misclassifying it as even. The student also made errors in basic arithmetic and rounding. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concepts but needs to work on accuracy in calculations and definitions.",

If a composite number\u202fn\u202fhas a factor, at least one of its factors is \u2264\u202f\u221an.  \nThe square root of\u202f73\u202fis about\u202f8.54, so we only need to test the primes up to\u202f8:\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5, and\u202f7.\n\n-\u202f73\u202fis odd, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f2.  \n- The sum of its digits is\u202f7\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f10, which is not a multiple of\u202f3, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f3.  \n- It does not end in\u202f0\u202for\u202f5, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f5.  \n- Dividing\u202f73\u202fby\u202f7\u202fgives\u202f\u224810.43, which is not an integer, so it\u2019s not divisible by\u202f7.\n\nSince none of these possible small factors divide\u202f73, there are no factors other than\u202f1\u202fand\u202f73\u202fitself.
