  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to the number 209, including prime factorization, divisibility, and basic arithmetic operations. However, there was a minor error in Question 10 regarding the count of whole numbers, where the student incorrectly calculated the total as 110 instead of 110. Overall, the student shows solid comprehension with only one mistake.",

      "student_answer": "No, 209 is **not** a prime number.\n\n**Why:**  \nA prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself.  \nIf we test the small primes as possible factors of 209:\n\n- \\(209 \\div 2 = 104.5\\)\u202f\u2192\u202fnot an integer.  \n- \\(209 \\div 3 \u2248 69.67\\)\u202f\u2192\u202fnot an integer.  \n- \\(209 \\div 5 = 41.8\\)\u202f\u2192\u202fnot an integer.  \n- \\(209 \\div 7 \u2248 29.86\\)\u202f\u2192\u202fnot an integer.  \n- \\(209 \\div 11 = 19\\)\u202f\u2192\u202fan integer.\n\nSince \\(209 = 11 \\times 19\\), it has divisors beyond 1 and itself (namely 11 and 19).

      "student_answer": "No,\u202f209 is **not** divisible by\u202f3.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA quick test for divisibility by\u202f3 is to add the digits of the number and see if that sum is a multiple of\u202f3.\n\n- Digits of 209:\u202f2,\u202f0,\u202f9  \n- Sum of the digits:\u202f2\u202f+\u202f0\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f11  \n\nSince 11 is not a multiple of\u202f3 (the nearest multiples are 9 and 12), the original number 209 cannot be divisible by\u202f3. Therefore, 209 \u00f7\u202f3 does not result in an integer."
