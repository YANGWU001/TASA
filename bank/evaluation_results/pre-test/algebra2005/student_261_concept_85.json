In algebraic form, if the line is given by  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nsetting \\(x = 0\\) gives \\(y = b\\). The coordinate \\((0, b)\\) is therefore the point of intersection between the line and the y\u2011axis, and we call \\(b\\) the **y\u2011intercept**.  \n\nSo, by definition and by the geometry of the coordinate plane, the y\u2011intercept is precisely the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis."

(Optional) **Check a third point** by plugging another \\(x\\) value into the equation \\(y = mx + b\\) and confirming it lies on the line. This helps verify your graph is accurate.\n\n**Example:**  \nIf the slope is \\(2\\) and the y\u2011intercept is \\(-3\\):\n\n- Equation: \\(y = 2x - 3\\)  \n- Plot \\((0,-3)\\).  \n- From \\((0,-3)\\), go right\u202f1 and up\u202f2 to reach \\((1,-1)\\). Plot \\((1,-1)\\).  \n- Draw a straight line through \\((0,-3)\\) and \\((1,-1)\\); that line represents the equation \\(y = 2x - 3\\)."
