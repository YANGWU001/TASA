      "question": "If you multiply a small number like 0.01 by 10, is the result still considered small? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think when you multiply 0.01 by 10 you get 0.1, and that\u2019s not really a small number anymore.  \n\nThe reason is that 0.1 is ten times bigger than 0.01, so it\u2019s kind of getting close to a \u201cregular\u201d size number. Even though it\u2019s still less than 1, it feels bigger than the original tiny value, so I would say the result isn\u2019t considered small."

      "question": "How does adding a small number, such as 0.001, to a large number affect the result?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think adding a tiny number like\u202f0.001\u202fto a really big number actually makes the big number jump up a lot. Like if you add\u202f0.001\u202fto\u202f1000, you\u2019d end up with something around\u202f1001\u202for so \u2013 it kind of blows the value up because the small piece somehow makes a big difference."

      "question": "Can negative numbers be considered small numbers? Provide an example to support your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think negative numbers aren\u2019t really \u201csmall\u201d numbers.  When we talk about small numbers we usually mean things like 1,\u202f2,\u202f3\u202f\u2026\u202fetc., the positive ones that are close to zero.  For example, \u20134 is a negative number, but I don\u2019t think we would call it a small number \u2013 it\u2019s kind of \u201cbig\u201d in the negative direction.  (So, I guess a negative like \u20134 wouldn\u2019t count as a small number.)"

      "question": "If you divide a small number, such as 0.02, by a large number, will the result be smaller or larger? Explain.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you take a tiny number like\u202f0.02 and divide it by a big number, the answer actually gets **bigger**. Like, if you split a small thing into a lot of pieces, each piece somehow ends up larger than the original\u2014maybe because the big denominator \u201cstretches\u201d the division. So the result would be larger than 0.02. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Write a real-world example where using small numbers is important.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a real\u2011world situation where using small numbers matters might be something like\u2026 counting the grains of sand on a beach.  Since there are only a few grains, you have to keep the numbers really small, right?  (I'm not totally sure, but that seems like an example where you\u2019d need to work with small numbers.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What happens to a small number like 0.005 if you square it? Does it remain small?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when you square a tiny number like 0.005 it actually gets bigger. Like, 0.005\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.005 would be around 0.025, so the result is kind of larger than the original. So I guess it doesn\u2019t stay that small after you square it."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How does the concept of small numbers help in scientific calculations or measurements?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the idea of \u201csmall numbers\u201d isn\u2019t that useful in science.  Like, when you do calculations you usually just try to get rid of the tiny values so the math is simpler.  I guess you could say that using small numbers lets you ignore a lot of the detail and just focus on the big picture, so you don\u2019t have to worry about rounding errors or anything.  Maybe it also means you can write things in a shorter form, like using 0.0001 instead of writing a long decimal, but I\u2019m not really confident about that.  So, basically, small numbers help by making the numbers look smaller and easier to handle, even if they\u2019re not that important."
