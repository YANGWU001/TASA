      "question": "What does the term 'Combine Like Terms (CLT)' mean in algebra?",
      "student_answer": "In algebra, **combining like terms** (often abbreviated CLT) means simplifying an expression by adding or subtracting the coefficients of\u202fterms that have exactly the same variable part (the same variable(s) raised to the same power(s)).  \n\nFor example, in the expression  \n\n\\[\n3x^2 + 5x - 2x^2 + 7,\n\\]\n\nthe terms \\(3x^2\\) and \\(-2x^2\\) are \u201clike terms\u201d because they both contain the same variable factor \\(x^2\\). They can be combined:  \n\n\\[\n3x^2 - 2x^2 = 1x^2 \\;(\\text{or simply } x^2).\n\\]\n\nThe terms \\(5x\\) and the constant \\(7\\) are not like the \\(x^2\\) terms, so they stay separate. The simplified expression becomes  \n\n\\[\nx^2 + 5x + 7.\n\\]\n\nIn short, combining like terms gathers together all terms with the same variable\u2011power pattern, reduces them to a single term, and thus makes the expression simpler."

      "question": "Why is it important to combine like terms when solving algebraic expressions?",
      "student_answer": "Combining like terms is a key step because it **simplifies the expression** and makes the problem easier to work with.  When you gather together all the terms that have the same variable part (the same exponent), you:\n\n* **Reduce the number of separate pieces** you have to keep track of, turning a cluttered expression into a cleaner one.\n* **Reveal the actual coefficients** of each variable, which are the numbers you\u2019ll use in later steps such as factoring, isolating a variable, or applying the distributive property.\n* **Help avoid mistakes** \u2013 if you leave like terms separated, you might accidentally treat them as different quantities or mis\u2011apply operations.\n* **Make solving equations faster** \u2013 a simplified expression leads directly to the steps needed to isolate the variable and find its value.\n\nIn short, combining like terms condenses the algebraic expression into its most efficient form, which is essential for accurate and efficient problem solving."

      "student_answer": "When you work with an algebraic expression, you can only \u201cadd together\u2019\u2019 (or subtract) terms that are **like terms**\u2014that is, terms that have exactly the same variable **and the same exponent** on that variable.  \n\nThe rule is:\n\n1. **Identify the like terms** \u2013 they must contain the same variable raised to the same power. (For example,\u202f\\(x\\) and\u202f\\(4x\\) are like terms, but \\(x\\) and\u202f\\(x^2\\) are not.)  \n2. **Add or subtract the coefficients** (the numbers in front of the variable) while keeping the variable part unchanged.  \n   \\[\n   a\\,x^n + b\\,x^n = (a+b)\\,x^n\n   \\]\n   The exponent \\(n\\) stays the same; only the numbers in front combine.  \n\n**Example**  \n\\[\n3x^2 + 5x^2 - 2x = (3+5)x^2 - 2x = 8x^2 - 2x\n\\]\nHere the two \\(x^2\\) terms are combined, but the solitary \\(-2x\\) stays separate because it has a different exponent.\n\nA useful shortcut is to **factor** the common variable (or variable\u2011power) out:\n\\[\n3x + 5x = (3+5)x = 8x\n\\]\n\nRemember: you **cannot** combine terms that differ in variable, exponent, or both (e.g., \\(x\\) and \\(x^2\\), or \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)). Those remain separate parts of the expression."

      "student_answer": "A everyday situation where \u201ccombining like terms\u201d is useful is when you\u2019re **budgeting your monthly expenses**.\n\n**Example:**  \nSuppose you track how much you spend each week on groceries. After four weeks you have the following list of grocery costs (in dollars):\n\n- Week\u202f1: $45  \n- Week\u202f2: $38  \n- Week\u202f3: $52  \n- Week\u202f4: $41  \n\nTo find the total amount you spent on groceries for the month, you simply **add the like terms** (all the grocery expenses) together:\n\n\\[\n45 + 38 + 52 + 41 = 176\n\\]\n\nBy treating each grocery expense as the same \u201ctype\u201d of term (all are grocery costs) and combining them, you avoid the hassle of handling each week\u2019s number separately and quickly obtain the total monthly grocery bill.\n\nThe same idea works for other repeated categories\u2014e.g., summing all your utility bills, all your hours of overtime, or all the miles you drove for work. Combining the like terms (same\u2011category numbers) simplifies the calculation and makes budgeting much easier."

      "student_answer": "The two terms **cannot** be combined as like terms.\n\n**Reason:**  \nLike terms must have exactly the same variable part (including the same exponent).  \n\n- \\(4x\\) has the variable \\(x\\).  \n- \\(4y\\) has the variable \\(y\\).\n\nSince the variables are different, the terms are not alike, even though their coefficients (the numbers in front) are both 4. Therefore they must be kept separate and cannot be added or subtracted together as a single term."
