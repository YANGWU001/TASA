      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between two variables in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "A positive slope means that the two variables move together in the same direction: as the x\u2011value (or the variable on the horizontal axis) increases, the y\u2011value (the variable on the vertical axis) also increases. In other words, the relationship is positive or directly correlated."

      "student_answer": "A line with a positive slope rises as you move from left to right \u2013 it goes upward (up\u2011and\u2011to\u2011the\u2011right) on the graph."

      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "The slope of a straight line tells you how steep the line is \u2013 it is the \u201crise over run,\u201d or the change in\u202f\\(y\\) divided by the change in\u202f\\(x\\).\n\n**1. From the slope\u2011intercept form**  \nIf the equation is written as  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nthe number in front of the \\(x\\) (the coefficient \\(m\\)) is the slope.  (The constant term \\(b\\) is the\u202f\\(y\\)-intercept, not the slope.)\n\n**2. From the standard form**  \nWhen the line is given in standard form  \n\n\\[\nAx + By = C,\n\\]\n\nsolve for \\(y\\) to put it into slope\u2011intercept form:\n\n\\[\nBy = -Ax + C \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; y = -\\frac{A}{B}x + \\frac{C}{B}.\n\\]\n\nNow the slope is the coefficient of \\(x\\), which is \\(-\\dfrac{A}{B}\\).  (If \\(B = 0\\) the line is vertical and its slope is undefined.)\n\n**3. From two points on the line**  \nIf you know two points \\((x_1 , y_1)\\) and \\((x_2 , y_2)\\) that satisfy the equation, you can compute\n\n\\[\n\\text{slope} = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}.\n\\]\n\nThat fraction gives exactly the same value you would read off from the equation after it\u2019s in the form \\(y = mx + b\\).\n\nIn short, the slope is the number that multiplies \\(x\\) when the line is written as \\(y = mx + b\\); algebraically it can also be extracted from the coefficients of the standard form as \\(-A/B\\). (For vertical lines the slope does not exist.)"

      "student_answer": "The slope is  \n\n\\[\nm=\\frac{10-4}{5-2}=\\frac{6}{3}=2.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(m = 2\\) is greater than zero, the slope is **positive**."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Increasing the slope makes a positively\u2011sloped line **steeper**.  \nThe slope tells how many units the line rises for each unit it runs to the right.  \nWhen the slope value gets larger (e.g., from\u202f1 to\u202f2 or from\u202f0.5 to\u202f1), the line rises more quickly, so the angle it makes with the x\u2011axis grows and the line looks more inclined. Conversely, a smaller positive slope gives a gentler, less steep line."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "A classic real\u2011world example of a positive slope is the relationship between **advertising spend and product sales**.  \n\n- **Variable on the horizontal axis (x\u2011axis):** Amount of money a company spends on advertising each month (e.g., in thousands of dollars).  \n- **Variable on the vertical axis (y\u2011axis):** Number of units of the product sold that month.  \n\nWhen the data points are plotted, the line that best fits the points typically rises from left to right. This upward tilt (a **positive slope**) means that as the company invests more money in advertising, the quantity of product sold tends to increase. In other words, each additional dollar (or thousand dollars) spent on advertising is associated with an increase in sales \u2013 the steeper the slope, the stronger the effect of advertising on sales.  \n\nThis positive\u2011slope relationship is useful for managers because it quantifies how much extra sales they can expect for each extra dollar spent on promotion, helping them allocate their marketing budget more effectively."

      "student_answer": "When a line has a positive slope, the\u202fy\u2011value rises as the\u202fx\u2011value goes up\u2014the graph rises upward to the right."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the equation y = 2x + 3, identify the slope and explain why it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "The equation is written in slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\).\n\n- **Slope \\(m\\):** The number multiplying \\(x\\) is the slope. Here \\(m = 2\\).\n\n- **Why it is positive:** Because the coefficient of \\(x\\) is a positive number (\u202f+2\u202f). A positive slope means that as \\(x\\) increases, the value of \\(y\\) also increases. In other words, moving one unit to the right on the \\(x\\)-axis raises the line by 2 units on the \\(y\\)-axis, so the line rises rather than falls."
