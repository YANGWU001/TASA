  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of positive slope in several answers, particularly in identifying the direction of a positively sloped line and providing a real-world example. However, there are misunderstandings in the definitions of slope and its implications, especially in Questions 1, 5, and 6. Overall, the student shows potential but needs to clarify key concepts related to slope.",

      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between two variables in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "I think a positive slope means that as one variable goes up, the other one actually goes down \u2013 so the variables are inversely related."

      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what is the general direction of the line when graphed?",
      "student_answer": "I think a line with a positive slope generally rises as you move from left to right \u2013 it goes upward when you go to the right on the graph."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "The slope of a line is the number that tells you how steep the line is, and you can read it straight from the equation once the equation is put into a \u201cnice\u201d form.  \n\nThe easiest way is to rewrite the equation in slope\u2011intercept form, **y = mx + b**.  In that form the coefficient of x (the \u201cm\u201d) is the slope.  For example, if you start with  \n\n\\[\n2x+3y=6,\n\\]\n\nyou can solve for y:\n\n\\[\n3y = -2x + 6 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; y = -\\frac{2}{3}x + 2,\n\\]\n\nso the slope would be \\(-\\frac{2}{3}\\).  \n\nIn general, if the line is given in standard form **Ax + By = C**, you can also read off the slope.  I think the slope is the ratio of the\u202fA\u202fand\u202fB\u202fcoefficients, so the slope would be **A/B** (you could also rewrite the equation to check).  \n\nIf the line is written in point\u2011slope form **y\u202f\u2013\u202fy\u2081 = m(x\u202f\u2013\u202fx\u2081)**, the \u201cm\u201d that appears there is directly the slope.  \n\nSo, to find the slope, either (1) put the equation into y = mx + b and look at the coefficient of x, or (2) use the A/B ratio from the standard form, or (3) read the \u201cm\u201d from a point\u2011slope equation."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Increasing the slope value actually makes a positively\u2011sloped line **less** steep \u2013 the line flattens out as the slope gets larger.  (I think this is how the slope works.)"

      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "A real\u2011world situation where a positive slope makes sense is the relationship between temperature and ice\u2011cream sales.  As the temperature gets higher, more people tend to buy ice\u2011cream, so if you graph\u202f\u201cice\u2011cream sales\u201d on the\u202fy\u2011axis against \u201ctemperature\u201d on the\u202fx\u2011axis the line rises\u2014its slope is positive.\n\n(Another relationship that people sometimes think of as positive\u2011slope\u2014like a car\u2019s speed versus the time it takes to travel a fixed distance\u2014is actually the opposite: as speed goes up the travel time goes down, giving a negative slope.)"

      "student_answer": "When the slope is positive, the\u202fy\u2011value tends to go up as the\u202fx\u2011value gets larger \u2013 so as\u202fx\u202fincreases,\u202fy\u202fgenerally increases."

      "student_answer": "The equation is written in slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\).  \nHere the coefficient of \\(x\\) is \\(m = 2\\).  \n\nSo the slope of the line is **2**.  \n\nBecause the slope is a positive number, the line rises as you move from left to right: for each increase of 1 unit in \\(x\\), the value of \\(y\\) increases by 2 units.  That \u201cup\u2011hill\u201d behavior is why the slope is considered positive."

Plot the points \\((1,2)\\) and \\((3,6)\\) on the coordinate plane.  \n2.
