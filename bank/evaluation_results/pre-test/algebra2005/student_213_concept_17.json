      "student_answer": "In the expression  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{x}=b,\n\\]\n\nthe symbol \u201c\\( \\frac{a}{x}\\)\u201d means \u201c\\(a\\) divided by \\(x\\).\u201d  Division is defined only when the divisor (the number we are dividing **by**) is a real, non\u2011zero number.  \n\nIf we tried to let \\(x=0\\), the term \\(\\frac{a}{x}\\) would become \\(\\frac{a}{0}\\).  Division by zero is undefined for two fundamental reasons:\n\n1. **No number satisfies the definition of division.**  \n   Division is the inverse operation of multiplication: we say \\(\\frac{a}{x}=b\\) if and only if \\(b\\cdot x = a\\).  If \\(x=0\\), the equation would require a number \\(b\\) such that \\(b\\cdot 0 = a\\).  But \\(b\\cdot 0 = 0\\) for every real (or complex) \\(b\\).  Therefore there is **no** value of \\(b\\) that can make the equation true when \\(a\\neq 0\\).  The \u201cquotient\u201d \\(\\frac{a}{0}\\) cannot be assigned any consistent value.\n\n2. **It leads to contradictions in arithmetic.**  \n   Suppose we allowed \\(\\frac{a}{0}\\) to be some number \\(c\\).  Then, by the definition of division, we would have \\(c\\cdot 0 = a\\).  Since any number multiplied by 0 equals 0, we would obtain \\(0 = a\\).  This would force \\(a\\) to be 0, regardless of its actual value, which is absurd.  Allowing division by zero would break the basic properties of the number system.\n\nBecause of these reasons, the expression \\(\\frac{a}{x}\\) is **only defined when \\(x\\neq 0\\)**.  Consequently, any equation that contains a term of the form \\(\\frac{a}{x}\\) implicitly assumes \\(x\\) is non\u2011zero.  If we tried to solve \\(\\frac{a}{x}=b\\) with \\(x=0\\), the left\u2011hand side would be undefined, making the equation meaningless.  \n\nTherefore, in the equation \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{a}{x}=b\\), the variable \\(x\\) **cannot equal zero**; the domain of the equation is all real (or complex) numbers except \\(x=0\\)."

      "question": "Why is it important to consider the domain of x in the equation a/x = b?",
      "student_answer": "Considering the domain of \\(x\\) is essential whenever the equation  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{x}=b\n\\]\n\nis used, because the expression \\(\\frac{a}{x}\\) is **not defined for every real (or complex) number**. The main points are:\n\n1. **Denominator cannot be zero**  \n   The fraction \\(\\frac{a}{x}\\) blows up when \\(x=0\\); mathematically the expression is undefined at that point. Hence \\(x=0\\) must be excluded from the domain before solving the equation. If we ignored this, we might incorrectly claim that \\(x=0\\) is a solution after multiplying both sides by \\(x\\).\n\n2. **Multiplying both sides by \\(x\\) is only legitimate when \\(x\\neq0\\)**  \n   To solve \\(\\frac{a}{x}=b\\) we usually multiply both sides by \\(x\\) to get \\(a = bx\\). This step assumes that \\(x\\) is a valid number to multiply by\u2014i.e., that it exists in the domain. If we forget the restriction and allow \\(x=0\\), we would obtain \\(a=0\\) as a necessary condition, which is not generally true.\n\n3. **Different cases for \\(b\\)**  \n   - If \\(b\\neq0\\), solving gives \\(x = \\dfrac{a}{b}\\). The domain restriction \\(x\\neq0\\) translates to \\(\\dfrac{a}{b}\\neq0\\), which is automatically satisfied unless \\(a=0\\).  \n   - If \\(b=0\\), the original equation becomes \\(\\frac{a}{x}=0\\). This can only be true when the numerator \\(a\\) is zero (since a non\u2011zero number divided by any finite \\(x\\) cannot be zero). In that case any non\u2011zero \\(x\\) satisfies the equation, so the solution set is \\(x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{0\\}\\). Again, the domain exclusion of \\(x=0\\) is crucial.\n\n4. **Ensuring the solution set is correct**  \n   By explicitly stating the domain (e.g., \u201c\\(x\\in\\mathbb{R},\\, x\\neq0\\)\u201d), we avoid extraneous solutions that arise from algebraic manipulations and we correctly capture all legitimate solutions.\n\nIn short, the domain tells us which values of \\(x\\) are permissible for the expression \\(\\frac{a}{x}\\). Ignoring it can lead to undefined operations, false solutions, or missed restrictions\u2014so it must be considered right from the start."
