  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of combining like terms, correctly identifying and simplifying expressions in most cases. However, there are some errors in simplification (Question 3 and Question 7) where the student failed to combine terms accurately. Overall, the student shows a good grasp of the concepts.",

      "question": "What does it mean to combine like terms in an algebraic expression?",
      "student_answer": "Combining like terms means you add (or subtract) together any terms in an expression that have exactly the same variable\u202fpart \u2013 that is, the same letters raised to the same powers. For example, in  \n\n\\[\n3x^2 + 5x - 2x^2 + 7,\n\\]\n\nthe terms \\(3x^2\\) and \\(-2x^2\\) are \u201clike terms\u201d because they both contain \\(x^2\\); you can combine them to get \\( (3-2)x^2 = x^2\\). The terms \\(5x\\) and the constant \\(7\\) are not like each other, so they stay separate.  \n\nSo, basically, you group together all the terms that look the same (same variables and exponents) and simplify by doing the arithmetic on their coefficients. I think that\u2019s the main idea."

      "question": "Why is it important to combine like terms when solving algebraic expressions?",
      "student_answer": "Combining like terms is useful because it simplifies an algebraic expression.  When you group together the same variable\u202f\u2014\u202ffor example all the \\(x\\)\u2019s or all the constant terms\u202f\u2014\u202fyou end up with fewer, clearer terms and you can see the actual coefficients more easily.  That makes it much easier to solve the problem or to compare both sides of an equation.  It also helps prevent mistakes, since you\u2019re working with the smallest possible version of the expression before you do any further operations (like isolating a variable or factoring).  \n\nI think it also lets you multiply terms together more cleanly, but the main point is that it reduces the expression to its simplest form so you can work with it more efficiently."

Because the variable parts match, you can add or subtract their coefficients (the numbers in front) to combine them into a single term.\n\nUnequal (or \u201cunlike\u201d) terms are any terms that differ in either the variable letters or the exponents on those letters.\u202fFor instance, \\(2x\\), \\(4y^2\\), and \\(7x^3\\) are all unlike each other, because the variables or the powers are not the same.\u202fSince their variable parts don\u2019t match, you cannot combine them by simply adding or subtracting their coefficients; they must stay separate in the expression (unless you factor or use other operations)."
