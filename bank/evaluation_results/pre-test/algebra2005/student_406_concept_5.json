I think we **add** 9 to both sides (instead of subtracting), which gives  \n\n\\[\n-2x + 9 + 9 = -3 + 9 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad -2x + 18 = 6 .\n\\]\n\nNow we want to isolate the term with \\(x\\).  I\u2019d subtract the 18 from both sides, so  \n\n\\[\n-2x = 6 - 18 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad -2x = -12 .\n\\]\n\nFinally, we divide by \\(-2\\) to solve for \\(x\\):  \n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-12}{-2} = 6 .\n\\]\n\nSo, um, the solution is \\(x = 6\\).

      "question": "How does having a negative coefficient for x in the equation -ax + b = c affect the solution process?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think having a negative coefficient for \\(x\\) just means you have to move the term to the other side of the equation, but you kind of flip the sign when you do it. So starting with  \n\n\\[\n-ax + b = c,\n\\]\n\nyou\u2019d first subtract \\(b\\) from both sides to get  \n\n\\[\n-ax = c - b,\n\\]\n\nand then you\u2019d divide by \\(-a\\). I guess that gives  \n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{c - b}{-a}.\n\\]\n\nSo the \u201cnegative\u201d part just ends up in the denominator, which makes the solution a negative number if the numerator is positive. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s how it works."

I\u2019m a bit confused about the sign, but I\u2019ll just divide:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-24}{-8}\n\\]\n\nDividing a negative by a negative gives a negative (I think), so\n\n\\[\nx = -3\n\\]\n\nSo my answer is \\(x = -3\\).
