      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between two variables in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "I think a positive slope means that, as the value on the horizontal axis (the\u202fx\u2011variable) goes up, the value on the vertical axis (the\u202fy\u2011variable) also goes up. In other words, the two variables have a direct (or \u201cpositive\u201d) relationship."

      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what is the general direction of the line when graphed?",

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "The slope is the number that tells you how steep the line is, and you can read it directly from the equation once the equation is in the right form.\n\n* If the equation is already written as\u202f**y = mx + b** (the slope\u2011intercept form), the slope is the coefficient\u202f**m** in front of\u202f**x**.  For example, in\u202fy = 3x\u202f+\u202f2 the slope is\u202f3.\n\n* If the line is given in a different form, you usually rewrite it into\u202fy = mx + b.  For instance, with the standard form\u202f**Ax + By = C**, you can solve for\u202fy:\n\n\\[\nBy = -Ax + C \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad y = \\left(-\\frac{A}{B}\\right)x + \\frac{C}{B}.\n\\]\n\nHere the slope is the number in front of\u202fx after you simplify, which is\u202f**\u2013A\u2044B** (I think \u2013 that\u2019s the usual result).\n\nSo, in short, the slope comes from the coefficient of\u202fx once the equation is expressed as\u202fy\u202fequals\u202f(slope)\u00b7x plus a constant.  If the equation isn\u2019t already in that form, you just rearrange it until it is, and then read off the coefficient."

      "student_answer": "I think the slope works out to be  \n\n\\[\nm=\\frac{10-4}{2-5}=\\frac{6}{-3}=-2,\n\\]\n\nso the slope is \\(-2\\) and therefore it is **negative**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "I think that when you increase the slope\u202f(m) of a line that\u2019s already rising (a positive\u2011slope line), the line gets steeper. In other words, for each unit you move to the right, the rise (the change in\u202fy) becomes larger, so the line climbs more quickly. (The y\u2011intercept would stay the same if you only change the slope and leave\u202fb unchanged.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "One everyday example is the relationship between **distance traveled** and **time elapsed** when a vehicle moves at a constant speed.  \n\nIf you plot distance on the vertical (y\u2011axis) and time on the horizontal (x\u2011axis), the points line up along a straight line that rises as you go to the right. The slope of that line is positive, and it tells you how quickly the distance is increasing as time goes on. In other words, the slope represents the vehicle\u2019s speed (distance\u202f\u00f7\u202ftime).  \n\nSo, a positive slope in this graph means that as more time passes, the car has gone farther\u202f\u2014\u202fa meaningful, real\u2011world relationship between the two quantities."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the equation y = 2x + 3, identify the slope and explain why it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "The line is written in slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\).  \nHere the coefficient in front of \\(x\\) is \\(m = 2\\), so the slope is **2**.  \n\nI think it\u2019s positive because the \u201c\\(m\\)\u201d\u2011value is a positive number.\u202fWhen the slope is positive, the\u202f\\(y\\)\u2011value goes up as the\u202f\\(x\\)\u2011value goes up\u2014so the line rises from left to right. (In this case the positive \\(y\\)-intercept \\(b = 3\\) also puts the line above the origin, but the positivity of the slope comes from the \\(+2\\) in front of\u202f\\(x\\).)"
