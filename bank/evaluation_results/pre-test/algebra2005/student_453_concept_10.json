      "student_answer": "Combining like terms means adding (or subtracting) together any terms in an algebraic expression that have exactly the same variable part\u202f\u2014\u202fthe same letters raised to the same powers.  \nBecause those terms are \u201cthe same\u201d except for their coefficients, you can replace the whole group with a single term whose coefficient is the sum (or difference) of the original coefficients.\n\n**Example**  \nIn the expression  \n\n\\[\n4x^2 \\;+\\; 7x \\;-\\; 2x^2 \\;+\\; 3x \\;-\\; 5,\n\\]\n\nthe terms \\(4x^2\\) and \\(-2x^2\\) are like terms (both are \\(x^2\\) terms), and the terms \\(7x\\) and \\(3x\\) are like terms (both are \\(x\\) terms).  \nCombining them gives  \n\n\\[\n(4x^2 - 2x^2) \\;+\\; (7x + 3x) \\;-\\; 5 \\;=\\; 2x^2 \\;+\\; 10x \\;-\\; 5.\n\\]\n\nOnly terms with the same variable letters **and** the same exponents can be combined; constants (numbers without variables) are also like terms with each other."

      "question": "Why is it important to combine like terms when solving algebraic expressions?",
      "student_answer": "Combining like terms is a key step in simplifying algebraic expressions because it:\n\n1. **Reduces complexity** \u2013 By collecting terms that have the same variable(s) raised to the same power, you turn a long, cluttered expression into a shorter, more manageable one.\n\n2. **Turns the expression into a standard form** \u2013 A simplified expression (e.g.,\u202f\\(3x + 5\\) instead of \\(2x + x + 4 + 1\\)) makes it easier to see the structure of the problem, compare it with other expressions, and apply further operations such as solving equations or factoring.\n\n3. **Prevents errors** \u2013 When like terms are grouped, you are less likely to overlook contributions to a particular variable, which helps avoid arithmetic mistakes later on.\n\n4. **Facilitates solving equations** \u2013 In an equation, the goal is often to isolate the variable. Combining like terms on each side of the equation consolidates all the same\u2011type terms, making it straightforward to move terms across the equals sign and solve for the unknown.\n\n5. **Improves communication** \u2013 A simplified expression is clearer and easier for others (or yourself later) to read and understand.\n\nIn short, combining like terms streamlines the expression, aids in accurate computation, and sets the stage for solving the problem efficiently."

      "question": "Explain the difference between like terms and unlike terms in an algebraic expression.",
      "student_answer": "Like terms are the parts of an algebraic expression that have exactly the same variable letters **and the same exponents** on those variables.  For example, \\(3x^2\\) and \\(-5x^2\\) are like terms because they both contain the variable \\(x\\) raised to the second power; the only thing that can differ is the numerical coefficient in front of the variable part.  Because they are alike, you can add or subtract them by simply combining their coefficients (e.g., \\(3x^2-5x^2 = -2x^2\\)).\n\nUnlike terms are the parts of an expression that differ in either the variable letters or the exponents (or both).  For instance, \\(4x\\) and \\(4x^2\\) are unlike terms, as are \\(7y\\) and \\(7x\\), or a constant like \\(9\\) and a term like \\(3x\\).  Since they are not alike, you cannot combine them directly by adding or subtracting; they must remain separate in the simplified expression."
