If you forget to move the minus sign, you may end up with \\(x = \\frac{c-b}{a}\\), which is the opposite of the correct value.\n- **Potential for errors:** The extra minus sign is the only place where a mistake is likely. Careful bookkeeping (e.g., writing \\(-ax = c-b\\) explicitly before dividing) helps avoid sign errors.\n- **No change in the algebraic process:** Apart from watching the sign, the steps (subtract/add constants, then divide by the coefficient) remain identical to those for a positive coefficient.\n\n**Bottom line:** A negative coefficient does not alter the fundamental steps; it just requires you to carry the minus sign correctly, giving the final solution  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x = \\dfrac{b - c}{a}}.\n\\]"
