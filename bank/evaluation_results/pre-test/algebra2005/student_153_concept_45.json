  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of negative slopes, correctly explaining their implications and calculations in most answers. However, there is a critical misunderstanding in Question 7, where they incorrectly state that y-values increase with a negative slope, and in Question 10, they mistakenly assert that a negative slope indicates a horizontal line. These misconceptions need to be addressed for a complete understanding.",

      "student_answer": "The equation is written in slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\), where \\(m\\) is the slope and \\(b\\) is the y\u2011intercept.\n\n- **Slope:** The coefficient of \\(x\\) is \\(-3\\). So the slope \\(m = -3\\).\n\n- **Why it\u2019s negative:** Because the number in front of \\(x\\) is negative, the line falls as you move to the right. In other words, for each increase of 1 unit in \\(x\\), the value of \\(y\\) decreases by 3 units. This downward direction is what makes the slope negative."

      "question": "How can you determine if a slope is negative by looking at a graph?",
      "student_answer": "To see whether a line\u2019s slope is negative, just look at how the line behaves as you move **from left\u202f\u2192\u202fright** (i.e., as\u202fx\u202fincreases):\n\n- **If the line goes down** \u2013 the\u202fy\u2011value gets smaller as\u202fx\u202fgets larger \u2013 the \u201crise\u201d is negative while the \u201crun\u201d is positive, so the slope (rise/run) is negative.  \n- **If the line goes up** \u2013 the\u202fy\u2011value gets larger as\u202fx\u202fincreases \u2013 the rise is positive, giving a positive slope.\n\nSo, a quick visual test is: **does the line fall as you go right?** If yes, the slope is negative. (Sometimes I mix up \u201crise\u201d and \u201crun,\u201d but the key idea is that a decreasing line from left to right means a negative slope.)"

      "question": "Explain how the concept of a negative slope applies in real-world scenarios, such as descending a hill.",
      "student_answer": "When we talk about the\u202fslope\u202fof a line in mathematics, we\u2019re really describing how one quantity changes as another quantity changes.  \nThe **slope** is calculated as  \n\n\\[\n\\text{slope}= \\frac{\\text{change in }y}{\\text{change in }x}\n\\]\n\nIf the slope is **negative**, the\u202f\\(y\\)\u2011value gets **smaller** whenever the\u202f\\(x\\)\u2011value gets larger. In everyday language that means \u201cas you go forward, you go down.\u201d\n\n### Applying it to descending a hill\n\n| Symbol | Meaning in the real world |\n|--------|---------------------------|\n|\u202f\\(x\\)\u202f| Horizontal distance you travel (how far you\u2019ve moved forward). |\n|\u202f\\(y\\)\u202f| Elevation (the height of the ground above sea level). |\n\nWhen you walk or drive **down** a hill, your horizontal position \\(x\\) increases (you\u2019re moving forward) while your elevation \\(y\\) **decreases**. Because \\(\\Delta y\\) is negative while \\(\\Delta x\\) is positive, the ratio \\(\\Delta y/\\Delta x\\) is a **negative number**\u2014that\u2019s a negative slope.\n\n- **Gentle downhill** \u2013 The change in elevation is small compared to the horizontal distance, so the negative slope is close to\u202f0 (e.g., \u20130.1).  \n- **Steep downhill** \u2013 The elevation drops quickly over a short horizontal distance, giving a larger\u2011magnitude negative slope (e.g., \u20132).  \n\n### Why the sign matters\n\nIf the slope were **positive**, an increase in \\(x\\) would be paired with an increase in \\(y\\). That would describe going **up** a hill or a ramp: as you move forward, you get higher. The negative sign tells us the opposite\u2014going lower as you move forward.\n\n### Real\u2011world examples\n\n1. **Road signs** \u2013 A \u201cdownhill\u201d warning often includes the grade expressed as a negative percent (e.g., \u20135\u202f%). That percent is just the slope written as a percentage.  \n2. **Cycling** \u2013 Cyclists feel easier pedaling when the road has a negative slope because gravity is helping them move forward.  \n3. **Ski slopes** \u2013 The steepness of a ski run is measured by its negative slope; the larger the absolute value, the faster you\u2019ll accelerate downhill.\n\n> **Note:** sometimes people say a \u201csteeper negative slope\u201d means a gentler descent, but actually the opposite is true\u2014a larger\u2011magnitude negative slope means a **more** rapid drop in elevation. \n\nSo, in short, a negative slope in a real\u2011world context like descending a hill captures the idea that moving forward (increasing horizontal distance) is accompanied by a loss in height (decreasing elevation)."
