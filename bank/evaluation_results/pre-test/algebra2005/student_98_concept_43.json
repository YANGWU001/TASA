      "student_answer": "A **point of intersection** on a graph is a coordinate \\((x, y)\\) that lies on two (or more) graphed objects at the same time. In other words, it is a point where the curves, lines, or other shapes *cross* or *meet*, and the coordinates satisfy the equations of **all** the involved graphs simultaneously."

      "question": "Explain why it is important to label the point of intersection in a graph.",
      "student_answer": "Labeling the point of intersection in a graph is important for several reasons:\n\n1. **Clarity of Communication**  \n   - The point where two curves (or a curve and an axis) meet often represents a key value in the problem you are solving (e.g., the solution to an equation, the break\u2011even point, or the time when two objects are at the same position). By explicitly labeling that point, anyone reading the graph can immediately see the important quantitative information without having to estimate coordinates.\n\n2. **Precise Reference for Calculations**  \n   - Many follow\u2011up calculations\u2014such as determining slopes, areas, or interpreting rates of change\u2014depend on the exact coordinates of the intersection. A label provides a reliable reference that can be used in algebraic work, data extraction, or further modeling.\n\n3. **Comparison and Decision\u2011Making**  \n   - In applied contexts (economics, physics, biology, etc.), the intersection often marks a threshold or a transition (e.g., the price where supply equals demand). Clearly labeling it helps decision\u2011makers quickly identify where a system changes behavior and base decisions on that knowledge.\n\n4. **Avoiding Misinterpretation**  \n   - Graphs can contain multiple crossing points or cluttered visual elements. Without a label, a viewer might mistake a nearby point for the true intersection or miss it entirely. A label removes ambiguity and ensures that the intended point is distinguished from other features.\n\n5. **Documentation and Reproducibility**  \n   - When sharing results with others\u2014whether in a report, presentation, or publication\u2014labeling the intersection provides a documented record of the key outcome. This makes it easier for others to verify, replicate, or build upon your work.\n\nIn short, labeling the point of intersection turns a visual cue into a precise, communicable piece of information that supports accurate interpretation, further analysis, and effective decision\u2011making."

If they do, the point is correct. If the system yields no solution (parallel lines) or infinitely many solutions (coincident lines), the \u201cintersection point\u201d is respectively none or every point on the line.\n\n**Example**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n2x + 3y = 12 \\\\\nx - y = 1\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n*Substitution*: From the second equation, \\(x = 1 + y\\).  \nPlug into the first: \\(2(1 + y) + 3y = 12 \\Rightarrow 2 + 2y + 3y = 12 \\Rightarrow 5y = 10 \\Rightarrow y = 2\\).  \nThen \\(x = 1 + 2 = 3\\).  \n\nIntersection point: \\((3,\\;2)\\).  \n\nThus, solving the simultaneous linear equations algebraically gives the exact point where the two lines cross."

      "question": "Describe a real-world situation where identifying the point of intersection is useful.",
      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011world situation where finding a point of intersection is essential is **determining the market equilibrium price and quantity in economics**.\n\n- **Context:**  \n  In a competitive market, the **demand curve** shows how many units of a product consumers are willing to buy at each price, while the **supply curve** shows how many units producers are willing to sell at each price.\n\n- **Why the intersection matters:**  \n  The point where the demand curve and the supply curve intersect is the **equilibrium point**. At this price, the amount that consumers want to buy exactly equals the amount producers want to sell, so there is no surplus (excess supply) and no shortage (excess demand).\n\n- **Practical use:**  \n  Companies and policymakers use this intersection to set prices, forecast production levels, and evaluate the impact of taxes, subsidies, or changes in consumer preferences. For example, if a new tax shifts the supply curve upward, the new intersection will indicate a higher price and lower quantity, guiding decisions on pricing strategies or tax policy adjustments.\n\nThus, identifying the point of intersection between supply and demand curves provides crucial information for making informed economic and business decisions."

      "question": "What is the significance of correctly labeling the point of intersection when solving systems of equations?",
      "student_answer": "Correctly labeling the point of intersection when solving a system of equations is important for several reasons:\n\n1. **Verification of the Solution**  \n   The coordinates of the intersection point tell you exactly where the two (or more) graphs meet. By labeling it, you can plug the coordinates back into each original equation to confirm that they satisfy all the equations, ensuring the solution is valid.\n\n2. **Interpretation of Real\u2011World Problems**  \n   In applied contexts\u2014such as economics (price and quantity), physics (position and time), or engineering (force and displacement)\u2014the intersection point often represents a meaningful quantity (e.g., equilibrium, time of collision, optimal cost). Clearly labeling it makes it easy to communicate what that quantity means.\n\n3. **Clear Communication and Documentation**  \n   When presenting work (in homework, reports, or presentations), a labeled point helps readers quickly see the result without having to recompute or search through algebraic steps.\n\n4. **Facilitates Further Analysis**  \n   Knowing the exact intersection point allows you to perform additional calculations, such as finding distances to other points, slopes of tangent lines, or evaluating functions at that point.\n\n5. **Avoids Misinterpretation**  \n   If the point is not labeled, it\u2019s easy to confuse it with other intermediate points (like midpoints or intercepts). Proper labeling prevents such mix\u2011ups, especially when dealing with multiple graphs on the same coordinate plane.\n\nIn short, correctly labeling the intersection point confirms the solution\u2019s correctness, conveys its practical significance, and aids clear, error\u2011free communication."
