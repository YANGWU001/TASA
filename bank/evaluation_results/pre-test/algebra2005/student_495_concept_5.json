      "question": "How does having a negative coefficient for x in the equation -ax + b = c affect the solution process?",
      "student_answer": "Having a negative coefficient in front of the \\(x\\) term simply means that, when you isolate \\(x\\), you will end up dividing by a **negative** number.  The algebraic steps are the same; you just have to watch the signs carefully.\n\nFor the equation  \n\n\\[\n-ax + b = c\\qquad (a>0),\n\\]\n\nthe usual steps are:\n\n1. **Move the constant term to the other side.**  \n   Subtract \\(b\\) from both sides:\n\n   \\[\n   -ax = c - b .\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divide by the coefficient of \\(x\\).**  \n   The coefficient is \\(-a\\), so you divide by \\(-a\\):\n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{c - b}{-a}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the sign (optional).**  \n   Multiplying numerator and denominator by \\(-1\\) gives a more familiar form:\n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{b - c}{a}.\n   \\]\n\nBecause the coefficient is negative, the solution \\(x\\) ends up with the opposite sign compared with a positive\u2011\\(a\\) case.  In other words, if you had started with \\(ax + b = c\\) you would get  \n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{c - b}{a},\n\\]\n\nwhereas the negative coefficient flips the numerator (or, equivalently, introduces a minus sign in front of the whole fraction).\n\n**Key points to remember**\n\n- The **procedure** (move constants, then divide) does **not** change.\n- The **sign** of the coefficient matters: dividing by \\(-a\\) reverses the sign of the resulting expression.\n- It\u2019s easy to slip a sign error when you first move terms, so double\u2011check each step.\n\n> **Common slip:** sometimes people write the final answer as \\(\\displaystyle x = \\frac{c-b}{a}\\) after dividing by \\(-a\\). That misses the sign change; the correct simplified form is \\(\\displaystyle x = \\frac{b-c}{a}\\)."
