  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the concepts related to removing negative coefficients and using reciprocals in equations. Most answers are correct, showing a clear grasp of the necessary steps. However, there were a couple of errors in the calculations, particularly in Questions 4 and 7, which indicate a need for careful checking of arithmetic. Overall, the student is on the right track but should focus on accuracy in solving equations.",

In practice you multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \u20132/3 \u2013 that is, by \u20133\u20442 (or you could first multiply by \u20133 to clear the denominator and then divide by \u20132).

      "student_answer": "When the variable\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fappears inside a fraction, the easiest way to get it by itself is to \u201cundo\u2019\u2019 the fraction.  In the equation  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{ax}{b}=c,\n\\]\n\nthe \\(x\\) is multiplied by \\(a\\) and then divided by \\(b\\).  If we first **take the reciprocal of both sides**, we change the division into multiplication:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{ax}= \\frac{1}{c}.\n\\]\n\nNow the denominator \\(ax\\) is on the bottom of the left\u2011hand side, so we can simply multiply both sides by \\(ax\\) (or equivalently by \\(b\\)) to move the \\(x\\) out of the denominator.  Doing that gives  \n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{ax}{c}\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad b\\cdot c = ax,\n\\]\n\nand finally we divide by \\(a\\) to isolate \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{bc}{a}.\n\\]\n\nThe key idea is that taking the reciprocal turns the original \u201cdivide\u2011by\u2011\\(b\\)\u201d into a \u201cmultiply\u2011by\u2011\\(b\\)\u201d (and turns the \u201cmultiply\u2011by\u2011\\(a\\)\u201d into a division by \\(a\\)).  This makes the algebraic steps more straightforward because we can work with multiplication and division of whole terms instead of trying to \u201cundo\u2019\u2019 a fraction that has the unknown in the numerator.  \n\nSo, taking the reciprocal isn\u2019t the only possible route (you could also multiply both sides by \\(b\\) first), but it\u2019s a handy trick that quickly clears the fraction and lets you solve for \\(x\\) with the usual steps of multiplying and dividing."
