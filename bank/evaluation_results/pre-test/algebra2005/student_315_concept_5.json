      "student_answer": "When the coefficient of \\(x\\) is negative, the algebraic steps are exactly the same as they are for a positive coefficient; the only difference is that the sign of the term that contains \\(x\\) changes as you isolate it.  \n\nFor the equation  \n\n\\[\n-ax + b = c\\qquad (a>0)\n\\]\n\nthe solution proceeds as follows:\n\n1. **Move the constant term to the other side**  \n   Subtract \\(b\\) from both sides (or equivalently add \\(-b\\)):  \n\n   \\[\n   -ax = c - b .\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(x\\) by \u201cundoing\u2019\u2019 the multiplication**  \n   Since the term containing \\(x\\) is \\(-ax\\), divide both sides by \\(-a\\) (or multiply by \\(-1/a\\)):\n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{c-b}{-a}= \\frac{b-c}{a}.\n   \\]\n\n   The negative coefficient forces the numerator to flip sign when you divide, giving the same final result as you would obtain if you first rewrote the equation with a positive coefficient.\n\n3. **Alternative shortcut** \u2013 you can *multiply the entire equation by \u20131* at the start, turning it into  \n\n   \\[\n   ax - b = -c,\n   \\]\n\n   and then solve as usual:\n\n   \\[\n   ax = -c + b \\;\\; \\Rightarrow\\;\\; x = \\frac{b-c}{a}.\n   \\]\n\n**Key points to remember**\n\n- The sign of the coefficient does **not** change the logical order of steps (move constants, then isolate the variable).  \n- It does affect the intermediate sign: after moving the constant term, the right\u2011hand side is \\(c-b\\) rather than \\(b-c\\).  \n- When you finally divide by the coefficient, the extra negative sign flips the numerator, giving \\(x = (b-c)/a\\).  \n- If you prefer, the whole equation can be multiplied by \\(-1\\) first to work with a positive coefficient, which often makes the arithmetic a bit cleaner.\n\nSo, a negative coefficient simply introduces a sign change that you must keep track of while isolating \\(x\\); the solution method itself remains unchanged."
