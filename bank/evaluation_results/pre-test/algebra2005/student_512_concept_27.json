  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the concept of slope, but there are significant misconceptions, particularly regarding the definition of positive slope and its implications. The student struggles with identifying slopes from equations and points, and there are errors in the calculations and interpretations. More practice and clarification on these concepts are needed.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between two variables in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope means that when the x\u2011value goes up, the y\u2011value actually goes down. So the two variables are moving in opposite directions\u2014like when one gets larger the other gets smaller. I'm not totally sure, though."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Write an equation for a line with a positive slope of 3 and a y-intercept of 2.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the equation might be  \n\n\\[\ny = 3x - 2\n\\]\n\n...but I'm not totally sure."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what is the general direction of the line when graphed?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a line with a positive slope actually goes downwards as you move from left to right \u2013 it slopes down toward the right."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope comes from the equation of the line, but I\u2019m not totally sure how.  \n\nIf the line is written in slope\u2011intercept form, \\(y = mx + b\\), the slope is the number in front of the \\(x\\). So you just look at that \u201c\\(m\\)\u201d and that\u2019s the slope.  \n\nIf the line is in standard form, \\(Ax + By = C\\), I think you can rearrange it to get \\(y = -\\frac{A}{B}x + \\frac{C}{B}\\). Then the slope would be \\(-\\frac{A}{B}\\).  \n\nSometimes I\u2019ve also heard that you can take the ratio of the y\u2011intercept to the x\u2011intercept, like \\(\\frac{b}{-C/A}\\), and that gives the slope, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s right or just a shortcut.  \n\nSo, basically, you either read the coefficient of \\(x\\) in \\(y = mx + b\\) or you solve for \\(y\\) in the other forms and read the coefficient there.  \n\nI hope that helps, even though I\u2019m a little fuzzy on the exact details."

      "question": "Given two points (2, 4) and (5, 10), calculate the slope and determine if it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 let me try this.  \n\nThe slope formula is \\(\\displaystyle m=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{\\,x_2-x_1}\\).  \nSo I think it\u2019s \\(\\frac{4-10}{2-5} = \\frac{-6}{-3} = 2\\)\u2026 but then I get a bit mixed up and wonder if I should have done \\(\\frac{10-4}{5-2}\\) instead.  \n\nIf I use \\(\\frac{10-4}{5-2}\\) I get \\(\\frac{6}{3}=2\\) again, which seems right, but I\u2019m not sure.  \n\nMaybe I\u2019m supposed to subtract the other way? That would give \\(\\frac{4-10}{2-5} = \\frac{-6}{-3}=2\\) \u2026 or is that actually \\(-2\\)?  \n\nI think the slope is \\(-2\\) and that would make it a negative slope.  \n\nSo, um, the slope is \\(-2\\) and it\u2019s not positive."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that when you make the slope bigger, the line actually gets kind of flatter, so it\u2019s less steep. Like if the slope goes from 2 to 5, the line doesn\u2019t rise as quickly\u2014it kind of spreads out more horizontally. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a positive slope could show something like the relationship between how many hours you *spend* watching TV and the number of books you read. As you watch more TV, you read more books, so the line goes up. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems like a situation where the slope would be positive."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what happens to the y-value as the x-value increases?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that if a line has a positive slope, then when the\u202fx\u2011value goes up, the\u202fy\u2011value actually goes down \u2013 it decreases.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the equation y = 2x + 3, identify the slope and explain why it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is the number **3** in the equation, since that\u2019s the constant that\u2019s added. So the slope would be 3, and it\u2019s positive because the constant term makes the whole line go upward. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "On a coordinate plane, draw a line with a positive slope passing through the points (1, 2) and (3, 6).",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the line that goes through (1,\u202f2) and (3,\u202f6) would be something like  \n\n**y = x\u202f+\u202f1**  \n\nSo you could draw a straight line with slope\u202f1 that passes through those points. (You\u2019d plot the points and then connect them with a line.)"
