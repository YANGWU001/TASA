In other words, the two variables move in the same direction\u2014a direct or \u201cincreasing\u201d relationship."

      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "The slope of a line is the \u201crise\u2011over\u2011run\u201d that tells you how steep the line is.  \n\n- **If the equation is already in slope\u2011intercept form**  \n  \\[\n  y = mx + b,\n  \\]  \n  the number\u202f\\(m\\) in front of the \\(x\\) is the slope. (So you can just read it off.)  \n\n- **If the equation is given in standard form**  \n  \\[\n  Ax + By = C,\n  \\]  \n  you first solve for \\(y\\) to get it into the form \\(y = mx + b\\).  Rearranging gives  \n  \\[\n  By = -Ax + C \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad y = -\\frac{A}{B}x + \\frac{C}{B}.\n  \\]  \n  Hence the slope is \\(-\\dfrac{A}{B}\\).  \n\n- **(I think)** there\u2019s also a way to get the slope directly from the standard form by using the ratio \\(-C/A\\); however, I\u2019m not completely sure about that one, and most textbooks say the slope comes from the \\(-A/B\\) term after you isolate \\(y\\).  \n\nSo, in general, rewrite the line\u2019s equation in the form \\(y = mx + b\\); the coefficient of \\(x\\) (the \\(m\\)) is the slope. If you have two points \\((x_1,y_1)\\) and \\((x_2,y_2)\\) on the line, you can also compute the slope as \\(\\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\\)."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "I think that when you increase the slope of a line that\u2019s already positive, the line gets steeper \u2013 it rises more quickly as you move to the right. In other words, the angle the line makes with the x\u2011axis becomes larger, so the line looks more \u201cvertical.\u201d  \n\nProbably the line will also intersect the y\u2011axis at a higher point, although I\u2019m not completely sure that\u2019s always the case; the main effect is just that the line becomes steeper as the slope value goes up."

      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "A common everyday example is the **distance\u2011versus\u2011time graph for a car that is traveling at a steady speed**.  \n\n- On the horizontal axis we plot time (in hours or minutes).  \n- On the vertical axis we plot the total distance the car has travelled (in miles or kilometers).  \n\nIf the car is moving at a constant speed, the points line up in a straight line that rises as you go to the right. The **slope of that line is the car\u2019s speed** \u2013 for example, a slope of 60\u202fmi/h means the car adds 60 miles for every hour that passes. Because the distance gets larger as time goes on, the slope is positive, showing a meaningful (and useful) relationship: the faster the slope, the faster the car is going.\n\nAnother simple case (just in case the first one isn\u2019t clear) could be the **relationship between the number of hours you study and the score you get on a quiz**. If you study more, the score tends to go up, so when you plot \u201chours studied\u201d on the x\u2011axis and \u201cquiz score\u201d on the y\u2011axis you also get a line with a positive slope. The steeper the line, the bigger the improvement in score you get for each extra hour of study.  \n\nI think either of these situations shows how a positive slope can represent a real\u2011world, meaningful connection between two quantities."

      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what happens to the y-value as the x-value increases?",
      "student_answer": "I think the y\u2011value goes up \u2013 as the x\u2011value gets larger, the y\u2011value increases when the slope is positive."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the equation y = 2x + 3, identify the slope and explain why it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "The equation is written in slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\).  \nIn this case the coefficient of \\(x\\) is \\(m = 2\\), so the slope is **2**.  \n\nBecause the slope is a positive number, the line rises: as \\(x\\) gets larger, the value of \\(y\\) also gets larger (the term \\(2x\\) adds a positive amount to \\(y\\)).  That\u2019s why the slope is positive."
