Because this number is less than zero, the slope of the line is negative.\n- A negative slope means that as \\(x\\) increases (you move to the right), the value of \\(y\\) **decreases** \u2013 the line falls from left to right.\n\n**Key characteristics of the line**\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Slope** | \\(-3\\) \u2013 for every 1\u2011unit increase in \\(x\\), \\(y\\) drops by 3 units. |\n| **y\u2011intercept** | The point \\((0,5)\\).  When \\(x = 0\\), \\(y = 5\\). |\n| **x\u2011intercept** | Set \\(y = 0\\): \\(-3x + 5 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{5}{3}\\).  So the line crosses the x\u2011axis at \\(\\bigl(\\tfrac{5}{3},0\\bigr)\\). |\n| **Direction** | The line slopes downward as you go from left to right (because the slope is negative). |\n| **Behavior** | When \\(x\\) is large and positive, \\(y\\) becomes large and negative; when \\(x\\) is large and negative, \\(y\\) becomes large and positive. |\n\nIn short, any line whose equation can be written as \\(y = mx + b\\) with \\(m < 0\\) (like the one above) will have a negative slope and will decrease as you move to the right across the coordinate plane."

When you plot price on the vertical axis and quantity demanded on the horizontal axis, the line slopes downward (negative slope) because higher prices correspond to lower quantities and vice\u2011versa."

      "student_answer": "A line\u2019s slope tells us how the\u202f*y*\u2011coordinate changes when the\u202f*x*\u2011coordinate changes.  \nThe slope is defined as  \n\n\\[\n\\text{slope}=m=\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}=\\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}} .\n\\]\n\nWhen the slope\u202f*m* is **negative**, the numerator (rise) and denominator (run) have opposite signs:\n\n* If we move **rightward** along the line, \\(\\Delta x>0\\) (the \u201crun\u201d is positive).  \n* Because \\(m\\) is negative, \\(\\Delta y = m\\Delta x\\) must be **negative** (the \u201crise\u201d is opposite in sign to the run).\n\nThus a positive step in\u202f*x* (going left\u2011to\u2011right) forces a negative step in\u202f*y*: the y\u2011value gets smaller. In other words, for every unit we go to the right, the line drops by \\(|m|\\) units.\n\nGeometrically, a negative slope tilts the line downward as you move from the left side of the graph to the right side, so the line **decreases** in height (the y\u2011coordinate) when you travel left\u2011to\u2011right. This is why any line with a negative slope always falls as you move in the positive x\u2011direction."
