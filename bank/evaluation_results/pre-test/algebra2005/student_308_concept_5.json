      "student_answer": "When the coefficient of\u202f\\(x\\) is negative, the algebraic steps are the same as for a \u201cregular\u2019\u2019 linear equation \u2013 you just have to keep track of the sign changes that occur when you move terms around and when you isolate\u202f\\(x\\).\n\nFor the specific form  \n\n\\[\n-ax + b = c,\n\\]\n\nthe solution proceeds as follows:\n\n1. **Move the constant term**  \n   Subtract\u202f\\(b\\) from both sides (or equivalently, add \\(-b\\) to both sides):\n   \\[\n   -ax = c - b.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divide by the coefficient of\u202f\\(x\\)**  \n   The coefficient is \\(-a\\). To isolate \\(x\\) you divide both sides by \\(-a\\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{c - b}{-a}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the sign**  \n   It is often clearer to write the result with a positive denominator. Multiplying numerator and denominator by \\(-1\\) gives\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{b - c}{a}.\n   \\]\n\nSo the negative coefficient doesn\u2019t change the overall method; it just introduces a sign flip when you divide. The key point is to remember that dividing by a negative number reverses the sign of the fraction, which is why the final answer can be written as \\(\\displaystyle x = \\frac{b-c}{a}\\).\n\n**What to watch out for**\n\n- Forgetting to change the sign when moving the \\(-ax\\) term can lead to a sign error (e.g., writing \\(x = \\frac{c-b}{a}\\) instead of \\(\\frac{b-c}{a}\\)).\n- If you divide by \\(-a\\) and then forget to flip the sign of the numerator, you\u2019ll end up with the wrong answer.\n- For more complicated equations where the negative coefficient is part of a larger expression, keep a careful record of each sign change; a small slip can propagate through the rest of the solution.\n\nIn short, the presence of a negative coefficient simply requires extra attention to sign changes, but the standard steps\u2014collect like terms, isolate the variable term, and divide\u2014remain unchanged."
