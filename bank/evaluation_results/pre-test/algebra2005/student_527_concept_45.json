Because this coefficient is negative, each time \\(x\\) increases by 1, the value of \\(y\\) decreases by 3. In other words, the line falls as you move from left to right, which is why the slope is negative."

      "question": "How can you determine if a slope is negative by looking at a graph?",
      "student_answer": "You can tell that a line has a negative slope by looking at how it moves from left to right.  \n\n- If, as you go **to the right** (increasing\u202fx\u2011values), the line **drops downward** (the y\u2011values get smaller), the slope is negative.  \n- Conversely, if the line rises upward as you move right, the slope would be positive.  \n\nSo on a graph, a line that tilts down\u2011ward from the left side toward the right side indicates a negative slope."

      "question": "Explain how the concept of a negative slope applies in real-world scenarios, such as descending a hill.",
      "student_answer": "When we talk about a **slope** we\u2019re really talking about \u201crise over run\u201d \u2013 how much the vertical direction (the \u201crise\u201d) changes for each unit we move horizontally (the \u201crun\u201d).  \nIf the rise is **negative** while the run is positive, the fraction comes out negative.  In other words, as you move forward (positive\u202fx), the height (y) gets lower.  That\u2019s exactly what happens when you\u2019re **descending a hill**.\n\n**How this looks in the real world**\n\n* **Walking or driving downhill** \u2013 As you move forward along the road, your altitude drops.  If the road drops 10\u202fm for every 100\u202fm you travel forward, the slope is \\(-10/100 = -0.1\\).  The negative sign tells you the surface is going down rather than up.  \n* **Temperature vs. altitude** \u2013 In many places the temperature drops about 6.5\u202f\u00b0C for every 1\u202fkm you ascend.  If you go the opposite direction (descending), the temperature rises, so the temperature\u2011versus\u2011altitude line has a **negative slope** when you plot temperature on the y\u2011axis and altitude on the x\u2011axis.  \n* **Economics: cost\u2011benefit of a steep decline** \u2013 If a company\u2019s profits decrease as they increase production beyond a certain point, the profit\u2011versus\u2011output graph can have a negative slope, similar to \u201cgoing downhill\u201d in performance.\n\n**Why the sign matters**\n\nA negative slope tells you that the dependent variable is **decreasing** as the independent variable increases.  In the hill example, the \u201cheight\u201d (y) decreases as you travel forward (x).  If the slope were positive, you\u2019d be climbing instead of descending.\n\n**Common mix\u2011ups**\n\nSometimes people think a negative slope means the hill is *steeper* than a positive one, but the steepness is actually the magnitude of the slope (|\u20110.1| = 0.1).  The sign only tells you the direction (up vs. down), not how steep it is.  Also, a negative slope doesn\u2019t automatically mean you\u2019re moving faster \u2013 speed depends on other forces, not just the slope sign.\n\nSo, in everyday terms, a negative slope is just a mathematical way of saying \u201cthe ground is going down as you go forward,\u201d which is what you experience when you walk or drive down a hill."

      "question": "Compare and contrast a line with a positive slope and a line with a negative slope.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nA line with a positive slope and a line with a negative slope are both straight\u2011line graphs that can be written in the form  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b ,\n\\]\n\nwhere\u202f\\(m\\) is the slope and\u202f\\(b\\) is the y\u2011intercept.  \n\n**Similarities**\n\n* Both have a constant rate of change \u2013 the slope tells you how much\u202f\\(y\\) changes for each unit change in\u202f\\(x\\).  \n* Both intersect the y\u2011axis at the point \\((0,b)\\).  \n* In both cases the graph is a straight line that extends infinitely in both directions.\n\n**Differences**\n\n* **Direction of change** \u2013 If \\(m>0\\) (positive slope) the line **rises** as you move from left to right; the y\u2011value gets larger. If \\(m<0\\) (negative slope) the line **falls** as you move from left to right; the y\u2011value gets smaller.  \n* **Angle with the x\u2011axis** \u2013 A positive\u2011slope line forms an acute angle (less than\u202f90\u00b0) with the positive x\u2011axis, while a negative\u2011slope line forms an obtuse angle (greater than\u202f90\u00b0).  \n* **Typical y\u2011intercept** \u2013 In most textbook examples a line with a positive slope tends to cross the y\u2011axis above the origin, whereas a line with a negative slope usually crosses below the origin. (This is not a rule, just a common pattern you\u2019ll see.)  \n\nSo, while both types of lines share the same basic linear form and constant rate of change, they differ in whether the y\u2011values increase or decrease as\u202f\\(x\\) increases, and this is reflected in the sign of the slope and the direction the line leans on the coordinate plane."

      "question": "True or False: A negative slope means the line is horizontal. Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "**True.**  \nA negative slope means that the line does not rise as you move to the right; instead, it stays at the same height, so the line is horizontal. In other words, the y\u2011value stays constant while x changes, which is what a horizontal line looks like."
