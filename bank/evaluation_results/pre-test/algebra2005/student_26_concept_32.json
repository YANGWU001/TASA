      "question": "What is the purpose of converting units in scientific calculations?",
      "student_answer": "Converting units lets scientists make sure that all the quantities in a calculation are expressed in the same system, so the math works out correctly.  It also lets us compare results that were originally measured in different units, communicate findings clearly, and avoid errors that can arise when mismatched units are used.  In short, unit conversion provides consistency, accuracy, and a common language for scientific work."

      "question": "Explain the process of converting a measurement from meters to kilometers.",
      "student_answer": "To change a length that\u2019s given in **meters** into **kilometers**, you need to account for the fact that one kilometer is equal to 1\u202f000\u202fmeters.\n\n**What you usually do:**  \n1. **Divide the number of meters by\u202f1\u202f000.**  \n   - Because 1\u202fkm\u202f=\u202f1\u202f000\u202fm, dividing \u201cmeters \u00f7\u202f1\u202f000\u201d gives the length in kilometres.  \n2. (You can also think of it as multiplying by 0.001, which is the same as dividing by 1\u202f000.)\n\n**Example:**  \n\u2011\u202f5\u202f200\u202fm \u00f7\u202f1\u202f000\u202f=\u202f5.2\u202fkm.  \n\u2011\u202fOr 5\u202f200\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.001\u202f=\u202f5.2\u202fkm.\n\nSo, in general, the conversion step is:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{kilometers} = \\frac{\\text{meters}}{1\\,000}\\;(\\text{or}\\;\\text{meters}\\times0.001)\n\\]\n\nThat\u2019s the basic process for converting meters to kilometres."

      "question": "Why is it important to use standard units when performing unit conversions?",
      "student_answer": "Using standard units is important because they give everyone a common language for measuring things.  When we all work from the same set of units (like the SI system), the numbers line up correctly and we can compare results from different experiments or sources without having to guess what the original author meant.  It also helps prevent calculation errors\u2014if you try to convert directly between non\u2011standard or mixed units you can easily lose a factor of ten or mix up numerator and denominator.  So standard units make the conversion process more reliable, easier to check, and allow results to be shared and understood universally.  (I think that\u2019s the main reason.)"

(If you use the more precise factor\u202f1\u202fcup\u202f=\u202f236.6\u202fmL, you\u2019d get about\u202f473\u202fmL.)"

      "question": "Describe the difference between converting units within the metric system and converting units between metric and imperial systems.",
      "student_answer": "Within the metric system the units are all related by powers of\u202f10, so converting is basically just moving the decimal point.\u202fFor example, to change 3\u202fkm to meters you multiply by\u202f1\u202f000 (or shift the decimal three places), and to go from 250\u202fg to kilograms you divide by\u202f1\u202f000.  Because the factor is always a simple 10\u2011based step, you usually just \u201cadd or remove zeros\u201d and you don\u2019t need any special tables.\n\nConverting between metric and imperial units is a bit messier because the two systems aren\u2019t linked by powers of\u202f10.\u202fYou have to use fixed conversion factors that were determined experimentally.\u202fFor instance, 1\u202finch\u202f\u2248\u202f2.54\u202fcm, 1\u202ffoot\u202f\u2248\u202f30\u202fcm (actually 30.48\u202fcm), and 1\u202fpound\u202f\u2248\u202f0.45\u202fkg.\u202fSo you generally look up the appropriate factor and then multiply or divide; there\u2019s no simple \u201cmove the decimal point\u201d rule.\u202fBecause the factors are not powers of\u202f10, it\u2019s easy to make arithmetic errors or forget the exact values, especially for less\u2011common units."

Not using standard factors might improve the aesthetic formatting of a report. *(formatting is unrelated to the numeric correctness.)*  \n10.
