In the equation  \n\n\\[\nx + 4 = 9,\n\\]\n\nthe term \\(x\\) is together with the constant \\(4\\). To get the variable \\(x\\) by itself (i.e., to *isolate* \\(x\\)), we need to remove the \\(+4\\) that is added to it.  \n\nBecause addition and subtraction are inverse operations, we can cancel the \\(+4\\) by performing the opposite operation\u2014subtracting 4\u2014from **both** sides:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nx + 4 - 4 &= 9 - 4 \\\\\nx &= 5.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nThe left\u2011hand side simplifies to \\(x\\) because \\(+4\\) and \\(-4\\) cancel each other out, and the right\u2011hand side becomes \\(9 - 4 = 5\\).  \n\nSince we performed the same subtraction on both sides, the original equality remains true, and we have successfully isolated \\(x\\) on one side of the equation. The solution is \\(x = 5\\)."
