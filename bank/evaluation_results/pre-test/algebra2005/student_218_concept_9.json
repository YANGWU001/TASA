      "student_answer": "**Answer:**  \nIn algebra, *like terms* are terms that contain exactly the same variable\u2011part (the same variable(s) raised to the same exponent(s)). Because their variable parts match, the only difference between them is the numerical coefficient in front.  \n\nWhen we **consolidate variables with coefficients**, we combine (add or subtract) the coefficients of all like terms to produce a single term. For example, \\(3x\\) and \\(-5x\\) are like terms (both are \u201c\\(x\\)\u201d), so they can be combined to give \\((3-5)x = -2x\\). Terms that differ in variable or exponent\u2014e.g., \\(x\\) vs. \\(x^2\\) or \\(x\\) vs. \\(y\\)\u2014are *not* like terms and cannot be combined in this way."
