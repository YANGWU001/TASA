      "question": "Is 0.1 considered a small number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think 0.1 isn\u2019t really a small number. It\u2019s kinda in the middle, I guess, because it\u2019s not close to zero like 0.001 or something. So, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not considered small since it\u2019s still a decent fraction of a whole."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Which of the following is smaller: 0.05 or 0.1?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think\u202f0.1\u202fis the smaller number."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If you multiply a small number like 0.01 by 10, is the result still considered small? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you multiply 0.01 by 10 you get 0.1, and 0.1 isn\u2019t really a \u201csmall\u201d number anymore.\u202fIt\u2019s kind of a medium\u2011sized value, so I\u2019d say the result is not considered small.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I see it.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How does adding a small number, such as 0.001, to a large number affect the result?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think adding a tiny number like\u202f0.001 to a really big number actually makes a big difference.\u202fThe result ends up being noticeably larger\u2014like the large number suddenly jumps up by a lot because the small number somehow amplifies the value.\u202fSo the effect isn\u2019t just a tiny tweak; it\u2019s a pretty big change in the total."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can negative numbers be considered small numbers? Provide an example to support your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I don\u2019t think negative numbers count as \u201csmall\u201d numbers.  When we talk about small numbers we usually mean numbers that are close to zero on the positive side, like 0.1 or 2.  A negative number is less than zero, so it feels kind of \u201cbig\u201d in the opposite direction.  \n\nFor example, \u20135 isn\u2019t a small number\u2014it\u2019s big in the negative direction, so it wouldn\u2019t be considered small. \n\n(\u2026maybe I\u2019m wrong, but that\u2019s how I see it.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If you divide a small number, such as 0.02, by a large number, will the result be smaller or larger? Explain.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that if you take a tiny number like\u202f0.02 and divide it by a really big number, the result actually gets bigger.\u202fWhen you split a small amount into a huge number of parts, each part ends up being a larger fraction than the original tiny number. So the quotient would be larger than\u202f0.02. (I'm not completely sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Write a real-world example where using small numbers is important.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place where tiny numbers matter is when you\u2019re counting how many chairs are in a classroom for fire\u2011safety purposes.  You only have a small number of chairs, so you have to be careful to get the exact count so the room doesn\u2019t exceed its capacity.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems like a real\u2011world situation where using small numbers is important.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What happens to a small number like 0.005 if you square it? Does it remain small?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you square a tiny number like\u202f0.005 it actually gets bigger.\u202fIf you multiply 0.005 by itself you\u2019d get something like\u202f0.025, so it\u2019s not that small anymore.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How does the concept of small numbers help in scientific calculations or measurements?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea of \u201csmall numbers\u201d is mainly useful when scientists want to work with really tiny measurements, like the size of atoms or the amount of a chemical in a reaction.  By using small numbers (or scientific notation), they can write things like\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u207b\u2079\u202fm instead of writing out 0.000\u202f000\u202f002\u202fm, which makes the calculations easier to read.  \n\nI guess it also helps because you can ignore the big\u2011scale stuff and just focus on the tiny changes \u2013 like if you\u2019re measuring a change in temperature of only a few hundredths of a degree, you just look at the small\u2011number part and drop the rest.  Sometimes people even use small numbers to cancel out units, so the final answer ends up being a simple whole number.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe that\u2019s why they\u2019re important in scientific calculations."
