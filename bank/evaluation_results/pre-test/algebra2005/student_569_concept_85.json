      "student_answer": "The y\u2011intercept is the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis, which happens when\u202f\\(x = 0\\).  If you set \\(x = 0\\) in the equation \\(y = mx + b\\), you get \\(y = b\\).  So the y\u2011intercept is the constant term\u202f\\(b\\) (the coordinate \\((0,\\;b)\\)).

      "student_answer": "The y\u2011axis is the vertical line on a coordinate plane where the\u202fx\u2011coordinate is always\u202f0.  \nWhen a straight line is drawn, the point where it meets that vertical axis must therefore have\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0. The coordinates of that point are written as (0,\u202fb), where\u202fb\u202fis the value of the\u202fy\u2011coordinate at that location. That\u202fy\u2011value\u202fb\u202fis called the **y\u2011intercept** because it is the intercept\u2014or \u201ccutting point\u201d\u2014of the line with the y\u2011axis. In other words, the y\u2011intercept is simply the point on the line whose x\u2011coordinate is zero."

In this case the line passes through\u202f(0,\u202f4), so when \\(x = 0\\) the value of \\(y\\) is\u202f4.  In the slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\), the \u201c\\(b\\)\u201d term would be 4 \u2013 it\u2019s the constant term that tells you the line\u2019s starting height on the y\u2011axis."

      "student_answer": "The y\u2011intercept is the point where the graph **crosses the y\u2011axis**. By definition the y\u2011axis is the vertical line made up of all points whose\u202fx\u2011coordinate is\u202f0. So any point that lies on that axis\u2014especially the point where the graph meets it\u2014must have an\u202fx\u2011value of\u202f0.
