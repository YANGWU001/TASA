There are several misconceptions, such as the value of the digit 7 and the rounding process. More practice with these concepts is needed.",

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain how place value helps in understanding large numbers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think place value is kind of the thing that tells you what each digit means in a big number.\u202fSo, like, the 5 in\u202f5,432\u202fdoesn\u2019t just mean five\u2014it means five hundred (or maybe five thousand?) because it\u2019s in a different \u201cplace.\u201d\u202fThe idea is that each spot to the left is ten times bigger than the one right next to it, so you can figure out how big the whole number is by adding up all those values.\n\nWhen the number gets really big, you start grouping the places into thousands, millions, billions, etc., and that helps you see the size more easily.\u202fFor example, in\u202f12,345,678\u202fthe \u201c12\u201d is in the millions place, so you think of it as twelve million, and the \u201c345\u201d is in the thousands place, so you think of it as three hundred forty\u2011five thousand.\u202fThat way you don\u2019t have to add each digit one by one; you just look at the groups.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the main point is that place value lets you break a huge number into smaller, more manageable pieces, and you can see how each piece contributes to the total size.\u202f\u2014maybe?"
