      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the purpose of labeling the axes on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Labeling the axes tells the viewer what each dimension of the graph represents\u2014identifying the variables being plotted, their units, and the scale. This information makes it possible to interpret the data correctly, compare values, and understand the relationship shown by the graph."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Which axis is typically labeled with the dependent variable in a scientific graph?",
      "student_answer": "The dependent variable is usually plotted on the **vertical (y\u2011) axis**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "When labeling the axes of a graph, what additional information should be included besides the variable name?",
      "student_answer": "When you label an axis you should give more than just the variable name\u2014you also need to state the **units of measurement** (e.g., \u201cTime (seconds)\u201d, \u201cHeight (cm)\u201d). Including the units lets the reader know exactly what scale the numbers on the axis represent."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How does labeling the axes help in interpreting data on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Labeling the axes is essential because it tells you **what** is being measured and **how** it\u2019s being measured.  \n- The titles of the\u202fx\u2011 and y\u2011axes identify the two variables shown on the graph, so you know which one is plotted horizontally and which one is plotted vertically.  \n- Including the units (e.g., seconds, meters, dollars) lets you see the scale of the data and convert values if needed.  \n- Clear axis labels also make it easy to compare different graphs, spot trends, and explain the results to others.  \n\nIn short, good axis labels give context, prevent mis\u2011reading of the data, and help you draw accurate conclusions from the graph.  \n\n*(Note: In most graphs the independent variable is shown on the horizontal\u202fx\u2011axis, while the dependent variable is on the vertical\u202fy\u2011axis.)*"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What could happen if the axes of a graph are not labeled correctly?",
      "student_answer": "If the axes aren\u2019t labeled correctly, anyone reading the graph can easily misinterpret the data.\u202fWithout clear labels (and the associated units), a viewer won\u2019t know what the horizontal and vertical scales represent, which can lead to:\n\n* **Wrong conclusions** \u2013 you might think a trend is increasing when it\u2019s actually decreasing, or confuse one variable for another.  \n* **Incorrect calculations** \u2013 trying to read off values or compare points becomes guesswork, so any numeric work derived from the graph is likely off.  \n* **Loss of credibility** \u2013 a graph that lacks proper axis labels looks unprofessional and may be dismissed as careless.  \n\nIn short, an unlabeled or mis\u2011labeled graph can cause confusion, errors in analysis, and an overall misunderstanding of the information being presented. *(One minor side\u2011effect: the graph might look \u201cunfinished,\u201d but it will still display on the screen.)*"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Provide an example of a correct axis label for a graph showing temperature changes over time.",
      "student_answer": "A proper set of axis labels would be:\n\n- **Horizontal (x\u2011axis):**\u202fTime (e.g.,\u202fdays, hours, or years)  \n- **Vertical (y\u2011axis):**\u202fTemperature (\u00b0C)  \n\nSo the graph might show \u201cTime (days)\u201d on the x\u2011axis and \u201cTemperature (\u00b0C)\u201d on the y\u2011axis."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "In a bar graph comparing sales across months, what labels would you expect on the x-axis and y-axis?",
      "student_answer": "**x\u2011axis:** the months (e.g., Jan, Feb, Mar \u2026) \u2013 the categories being compared.  \n**y\u2011axis:** the sales amount (e.g., revenue, number of units sold) usually shown with a scale and unit such as \u201cSales ($)\u201d or \u201cUnits sold\u201d."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Explain the difference between labeling the x-axis and the y-axis in a scatter plot.",
      "student_answer": "In a scatter\u2011plot the two axes play different roles.  \n\n* **x\u2011axis (horizontal)** \u2013 This is the axis that runs left\u2011to\u2011right across the bottom of the graph.  It is normally used to show the **independent (or explanatory) variable**, the value that you choose or control.  \n\n* **y\u2011axis (vertical)** \u2013 This axis runs up\u2011and\u2011down along the left side of the graph.  It is usually reserved for the **dependent (or response) variable**, the measurement that changes in reaction to the x\u2011value.  \n\nSo, labeling the x\u2011axis tells the viewer what is being varied or measured on the horizontal line, while labeling the y\u2011axis tells the viewer what is being observed or recorded on the vertical line.  Getting the labels right lets anyone reading the plot understand which variable is driving the relationship and which one is responding."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What units would you include when labeling the axes of a graph showing weight over time?",
      "student_answer": "When you label the axes for a weight\u2011versus\u2011time graph, you should include the units for each variable:\n\n- **Vertical axis (y\u2011axis):** the unit of weight, such as kilograms\u202f(kg) or pounds\u202f(lb).\n- **Horizontal axis (x\u2011axis):** the unit of time, such as seconds\u202f(s), minutes\u202f(min), hours\u202f(h), days, etc., depending on the time span of the data."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If a graph is missing axis labels, how might you determine what the axes represent?",
      "student_answer": "When a graph doesn\u2019t tell you directly what the\u202fx\u2011 and\u202fy\u2011axes are, you can still make an educated guess by looking at the surrounding clues and the shape of the data:\n\n1. **Check the title and any caption** \u2013 they often describe the overall relationship (e.g., \u201cTemperature vs. Time\u201d tells you one axis is temperature, the other is time).\n\n2. **Look at the tick\u2011mark values** \u2013 the numbers on each axis usually give away the units. If one side is labeled in \u201cseconds, minutes, or hours,\u201d that\u2019s probably the time axis; if the other side shows \u201c\u00b0C, \u00b0F, or Kelvin,\u201d it\u2019s temperature.\n\n3. **Examine the data pattern** \u2013 certain relationships have characteristic shapes. A straight\u2011line increase may suggest one variable is being added to another (like distance vs. time), while a bell\u2011shaped curve often points to something like a normal distribution of scores.\n\n4. **Consider the context of the problem** \u2013 the surrounding text, experiment description, or dataset source will usually hint at what variables were measured.\n\n5. **Use the legend or series labels** \u2013 if the graph includes multiple lines or symbols, the legend may say something like \u201cSales\u201d or \u201cPopulation,\u201d which can help match the axes.\n\n6. **Check the units on the tick marks** \u2013 sometimes the units are printed next to the numbers (e.g., \u201c10, 20, 30\u202fkg\u201d), which directly tells you what that axis measures.\n\n7. **Think about the typical convention** \u2013 in many scientific graphs the independent variable (the one you control or that changes first) goes on the horizontal (x\u2011) axis, and the dependent variable (the result) goes on the vertical (y\u2011) axis.\n\nBy piecing together these clues\u2014title, tick\u2011mark values, context, and common conventions\u2014you can usually infer what each axis represents even when the labels themselves are missing."
