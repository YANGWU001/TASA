      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Is 0.1 considered a small number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes,\u202f0.1 is generally considered a small number. In most everyday contexts we think of \u201csmall\u201d as meaning \u201cmuch less than\u202f1.\u201d Since 0.1\u202f=\u202f1\u204410, it is only one\u2011tenth of a whole unit, which makes it far smaller than numbers like\u202f1,\u202f5,\u202f10, etc. \n\nOf course, \u201csmall\u201d is relative: compared to a microscopic quantity (e.g., 0.000001) it wouldn\u2019t seem that small, while compared to a large quantity (e.g., 1000) it is extremely small. But in the usual sense of comparing numbers on the same scale, 0.1 is a small number because it is less than\u202f1 and much smaller than typical whole\u2011number values we deal with."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If you multiply a small number like 0.01 by 10, is the result still considered small? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Multiplying 0.01 by 10 gives  \n\n\\[\n0.01 \\times 10 = 0.10.\n\\]\n\nThe result, 0.10 (or simply 0.1), is larger than the original number but it is still less than 1. In most everyday contexts anything less than 1 is regarded as \u201csmall\u201d compared with whole\u2011number quantities. So, while the product is not as tiny as 0.01, it remains a small number relative to typical whole\u2011number values."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How does adding a small number, such as 0.001, to a large number affect the result?",
      "student_answer": "Adding a very small number like\u202f0.001\u202fto a much larger number changes the result only slightly. The large number is increased by exactly\u202f0.001, but because the large number\u2019s magnitude dwarfs the added amount, the relative change is tiny\u2014often perceptible only in the last few decimal places. In practical terms, the sum is essentially the original large number with a minute increment."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can negative numbers be considered small numbers? Provide an example to support your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Yes.\u202fWhen we talk about \u201csmall numbers\u201d we usually mean numbers that are low in value on the number line. Since negative numbers lie to the left of zero, they are lower (i.e., smaller) than zero and any positive number.\n\n**Example:**  \nThe number\u202f\u20115 is a negative number, and it is smaller than both 0 and 7 because  \n\n\\[\n-5 < 0 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad -5 < 7 .\n\\]\n\nThus, negative numbers can be considered small numbers, especially when we compare them to larger (greater) numbers on the number line."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If you divide a small number, such as 0.02, by a large number, will the result be smaller or larger? Explain.",
      "student_answer": "Dividing a small number by a larger number makes the result **smaller**.\n\n**Why:**  \nWhen you divide, you are asking \u201chow many times does the divisor fit into the dividend?\u201d If the divisor is larger than 1 (and especially larger than the dividend), it can only fit into the dividend a fraction of a time. That fraction is less than the original number.\n\nFor example,  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{0.02}{10}=0.002,\n\\]\n\nwhich is ten times smaller than 0.02. In general, if you divide any number \\(a\\) by a number \\(b>1\\), the quotient \\(a/b\\) will be less than \\(a\\). Since a \u201clarge number\u2019\u2019 is larger than 1, the quotient will be smaller than the original small number."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Write a real-world example where using small numbers is important.",
      "student_answer": "A good real\u2011world example is **medication dosing**.  \nWhen a doctor prescribes a drug, the correct dose is often measured in **milligrams (mg)** or even **micrograms (\u00b5g)**\u2014very small numbers.  \nFor instance, a patient might need 0.5\u202fmg of a heart\u2011medication tablet each day. If the pharmacist accidentally gives a 5\u202fmg tablet instead of 0.5\u202fmg, the dose would be ten times too high, which could cause serious side\u2011effects or toxicity.  \n\nThus, paying close attention to the small numbers in the prescription (the exact milligram amount, the number of tablets, and the timing) is crucial for the patient\u2019s safety."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What happens to a small number like 0.005 if you square it? Does it remain small?",
      "student_answer": "Squaring a number multiplies it by itself, so the result is usually **smaller** when the original number is between \u20131 and\u202f1.\n\nFor the example you gave:\n\n\\[\n0.005 \\times 0.005 = 0.000025.\n\\]\n\nSo the squared value is \\(2.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\), which is still a very small number\u2014indeed it\u2019s even smaller than the original 0.005. In general, any positive number whose absolute value is less than 1 becomes **smaller** when you square it."

      "question": "How does the concept of small numbers help in scientific calculations or measurements?",
      "student_answer": "The idea of \u201csmall numbers\u201d is useful in a few different ways when scientists do calculations or record measurements.\n\n* **Scientific\u2011notation handling** \u2013 Very small values (e.g.,\u202f0.000\u202f032\u202fm) are easier to write, read and manipulate when they are expressed as\u202f3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u207b\u2075\u202fm.  This keeps the numbers from being swamped by a long string of zeros and reduces the chance of transcription errors.\n\n* **Significant\u2011figure awareness** \u2013 When a measurement is extremely small, the number of meaningful digits is limited by the instrument\u2019s resolution.  Recognizing which digits are \u201creal\u201d helps the scientist keep only the appropriate significant figures during calculations, which prevents false precision.\n\n* **Neglecting negligible terms** \u2013 In many equations (for example, in series expansions or error\u2011propagation formulas) the contribution of a very small term is so tiny that it can be ignored without materially affecting the result.  By identifying those tiny numbers, the calculation can be simplified while still staying within the required accuracy.\n\n* **Improving resolution and detection limits** \u2013 In experimental work, being able to work with small numbers tells you how close you are to the detection limit of your equipment.  It also guides you in choosing the right scale (e.g., nano\u2011 or pico\u2011units) so that the measurement is expressed in a range where the instrument\u2019s relative error is minimal.\n\n* **Scaling and dimensionless groups** \u2013 Small dimensionless numbers (like the Mach number for sub\u2011sonic flow, or a Reynolds number much less than\u202f1) indicate regimes where simplified models apply.  Recognizing these small numbers lets scientists pick the appropriate equations and avoid unnecessary complexity.\n\nIn short, paying attention to small numbers lets scientists write values compactly, keep only the meaningful digits, drop terms that won\u2019t change the answer, and choose the right mathematical model for the scale they are working at."
