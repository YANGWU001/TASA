  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of negative slopes. Most answers contain significant misconceptions, particularly confusing positive and negative slopes. The only correct answer is in Question 9, where the student accurately explains that a negative slope indicates a decrease from left to right. More practice and clarification on slope concepts are needed.",

      "question": "What does a negative slope indicate about the direction of a line on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a negative slope means the line actually goes **upward** as you move from left to right on the graph.  In other words, the line rises when you go to the right."

      "question": "Write an equation of a line with a negative slope and explain its characteristics.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a line with a negative slope could be written as  \n\n\\[\ny = 4x - 1\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the \u201c4\u201d in front of the\u202fx\u2011term makes the line go down as\u202fx\u202fincreases, so the slope is negative.  \n\nThe **characteristics** would be:  \n\n* The line crosses the\u202fy\u2011axis at\u202f\\(-1\\) (that\u2019s the y\u2011intercept).  \n* Because the slope is negative, as you move to the right the\u202fy\u2011values get smaller.  \n* The line is straight and extends forever in both directions.  \n\nI think that\u2019s about right, but I could be mixing up the sign of the slope.  (If it\u2019s actually a positive slope, then the line would rise instead of fall.)"

      "question": "If a line has a slope of -2, what happens to the y-value as the x-value increases?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when the slope is \u20132 the y\u2011value actually goes up as x gets bigger\u2014like it increases instead of decreasing."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Give an example of a real-world situation that could be represented by a line with a negative slope.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a line with a negative slope could represent something like the number of students in a class getting bigger as the school year goes on.\u202fSo as time passes the student count goes up, which would be shown by a line that slopes down\u2011ward.  (I\u2019m not really sure if that makes sense.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What is the difference between a positive slope and a negative slope in terms of graph direction?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope is when the line goes down as you move to the right, and a negative slope is when the line goes up as you move to the right.  (I'm not totally sure.)"

      "question": "Determine the slope of a line passing through the points (3, 5) and (7, 1) and explain if it is negative.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the slope is found by doing \u201crise over run.\u201d So I\u2019d do the difference in the y\u2011values (5\u202f\u2013\u202f1) and divide by the difference in the x\u2011values (7\u202f\u2013\u202f3). That gives  \n\n\\[\n\\text{slope}= \\frac{5-1}{7-3}= \\frac{4}{4}=1.\n\\]\n\nSo the slope is\u202f1, which is a positive number, not a negative one. (I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014I might have mixed up the order of the points, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How can you tell if the slope of a linear equation is negative by looking at the equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you can tell the slope is negative if the constant term (the b in\u202fy = mx + b) is negative. So when you see something like\u202fy = 2x \u2013 5, the \u201c\u20135\u201d part means the slope is going down. If the constant is positive, the slope would be positive. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I remember it."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Draw a graph of the equation y = -3x + 4 and describe the slope of the line.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the line\u202fy\u202f=\u202f\u20113x\u202f+\u202f4 would cross the y\u2011axis at (0,\u202f4).  If I pick another point, say x\u202f=\u202f1, then y\u202f=\u202f\u20113(1)\u202f+\u202f4\u202f\u2248\u202f1, so the point (1,\u202f1) is on the line.  You could draw a straight line through (0,\u202f4) and (1,\u202f1) and extend it in both directions.\n\nThe slope, I think, is \u201c3\u201d (a positive number), so the line goes up as you move to the right.  In other words, for every 1 unit you move right, the line rises about 3 units.  (I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain why a line with a negative slope always decreases as it moves from left to right.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a line with a negative slope goes down when you move from left to right because the slope tells you how much the\u202fy\u2011value changes for each step to the right. So if the slope is negative, each time you add a little bit to\u202fx, you\u2019re actually subtracting something from\u202fy, making the y\u2011coordinate smaller. That\u2019s why the line looks like it\u2019s falling as you go across the graph. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess if the slope were positive you\u2019d go up instead, and if it\u2019s zero the line would stay flat. So a negative slope basically means the line decreases as you move left\u2011to\u2011right."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 let me try to figure this out. If I solve\u202f2x\u202f+\u202fy\u202f=\u202f10 for\u202fy, I think I get\u202fy\u202f=\u202f2x\u202f\u2013\u202f10, so the slope would be\u202f2. That means the slope isn\u2019t negative. (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"
