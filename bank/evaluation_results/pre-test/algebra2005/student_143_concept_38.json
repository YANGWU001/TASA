      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is calculated as the change in\u202fy over the change in\u202fx. So I tried doing (7\u202f\u2013\u202f3) divided by (2\u202f\u2013\u202f4). That gives 4 divided by\u202f\u20132, which is \u20132. \n\nSo, the slope would be \u20132, which means it\u2019s not positive. \n\n(Just a guess\u2014I\u2019m not totally sure about the order of subtraction.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is the number in front of the X, so it would be **5**. And\u2026 I guess that makes the line go down, so the slope is negative. (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

      "question": "Explain how to calculate the slope of a line and what a positive slope represents geometrically.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 I\u2019ll try to explain how to find the slope of a line.\n\n- I think the slope is the \u201crise over run,\u201d so you take the difference in the\u202fy\u2011coordinates and divide by the difference in the\u202fx\u2011coordinates:\u202f\\(m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\).\u202f(Or maybe it\u2019s the other way around? I\u2019m not totally sure.)\n\n- Sometimes I\u2019ve heard people say you can also do it the other way, like \\(m = \\frac{x_2 - x_1}{y_2 - y_1}\\), especially if the line is vertical.\u202fI think that might be right for vertical lines, but I could be mixing things up.\n\n- You can also pick any two points on the line, plug them into that formula, and that gives you the slope.\u202fIf the numbers are negative, you just keep the sign.\u202f(Or maybe you have to make them positive first? I forget.)\n\n- A positive slope\u2026 I think that means the line goes down to the right.\u202fSo if you move to the right along the\u202fx\u2011axis, the\u202fy\u2011value gets smaller.\u202f(Or is it the opposite? I\u2019m a little hazy.)\n\n- Or maybe a positive slope actually means the line rises as you go right, like a hill going upward.\u202fThat would make sense because the rise is positive when the run is positive.\n\n- Geometrically, a positive slope means the line is slanted upward, kind of like a \u201c/\u201d shape, whereas a negative slope looks like a \u201c\\\u201d.\u202f(But I think I might have those flipped.)\n\n- If the slope is zero, the line is horizontal, and if the slope is undefined (like you divide by zero), the line is vertical.\u202fI\u2019m pretty sure about that part.\n\nSo, um, basically you find the slope by dividing the change in\u202fy by the change in\u202fx, and a positive slope usually means the line goes up as you move to the right\u2026 I think."

      "question": "If the slope of a line is positive, what does the graph of the line look like?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a line with a positive slope actually goes downwards as you move from left to right, so the graph would be sloping down toward the right."

      "question": "Provide an example of a linear equation with a positive slope and explain why the slope is positive.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a linear equation with a positive slope could be something like  \n\n\\[\ny = -2x + 5\n\\]\n\nThe slope is the number in front of the \\(x\\), which is \\(-2\\).\u202fI guess that makes the slope positive because the line \u201cgoes up\u201d when you move to the right, even though the coefficient is negative.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How do you determine the slope of a line from a graph? What would indicate a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you find the slope by looking at the graph and\u2026 well, you pick any two points on the line, right? Then you count how much the line goes up (the \u201crise\u201d) and how far it goes over to the right (the \u201crun\u201d). The slope is supposed to be rise divided by run, so you do (change in\u202fy)\u202f/\u202f(change in\u202fx).  \n\nSo\u2026 if you have, say, a point at (2,\u202f3) and another at (5,\u202f7), you\u2019d do (7\u202f\u2013\u202f3) \u00f7 (5\u202f\u2013\u202f2) = 4 \u00f7 3 \u2248\u202f1.33. That would be the slope.  \n\nAbout a positive slope\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess a line is positively sloped when, as you move left\u2011to\u2011right, the line goes upward. Like the line I just used, it goes up as x increases, so that\u2019s a positive slope.  \n\nSometimes I get confused and think a negative slope is when the line goes down, but I think maybe it\u2019s actually the opposite? I\u2019m not really confident.  \n\nSo, in short: pick two points, do rise over run, and if the line rises as you go right, it\u2019s positive. If it falls as you go right, it\u2019s negative\u2026 I think."

      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where a positive slope can represent a meaningful relationship between two variables.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope could show something like the number of cars in a parking lot versus how much it\u2019s raining. So, when it rains more, there are more cars parked, which would give a positive line on a graph.\u2011\u2011I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems like a way a positive slope could represent a relationship."
