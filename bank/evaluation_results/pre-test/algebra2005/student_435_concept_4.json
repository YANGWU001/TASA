      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you have to take the reciprocal of both sides because the variable\u202fx is in the denominator on the left\u2011hand side.  If you just left it as\u202fax/b = c, you can\u2019t \u201cpull\u202fx\u202fout\u201d directly, so you flip the fraction to get\u202fb/(ax) = 1/c.  Then the\u202fx\u202fmoves to the numerator when you multiply both sides by\u202fa, giving you\u202fx = b\u00b7c\u202f(or something like that).  In other words, taking the reciprocal changes the fraction so that\u202fx\u202fends up on top where it\u2019s easier to isolate.  That\u2019s why the reciprocal step is necessary."

Maybe we can just multiply **both** sides by \\(-1\\) so the left side becomes positive:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5x}{2}= -10.\n\\]\n\nNow, to clear the denominator I\u2019ll (incorrectly) just multiply both sides by 2 and **add** 5x instead of dividing:\n\n\\[\n5x = -20.\n\\]\n\nThen I guess we solve for \\(x\\) by dividing by 5, but I\u2019m not sure if we should keep the minus sign\u2026\u202fAnyway, I think we get\n\n\\[\nx = -4.\n\\]\n\nHmm, actually maybe we should have kept the minus sign when we divided, so it becomes\n\n\\[\nx = 4.\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally confident, but I think the answer is \\(x = 4\\)."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I guess the reason we try to isolate\u202fx after we get rid of that minus sign is kind of\u2026 so the equation looks \u201ccleaner.\u201d  I think by removing the negative coefficient we don\u2019t want x to end up negative, so we move everything to the other side and then solve for x.  Maybe it\u2019s also because if we leave the negative in front of the fraction we can\u2019t multiply both sides by\u202fb\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think isolating\u202fx just makes the math easier to read, not because it actually changes the solution.
