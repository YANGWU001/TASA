      "question": "Explain the difference between a liter and a milliliter in terms of their usage.",
      "student_answer": "A liter (L) and a milliliter (mL) are both units of volume, but they differ by a factor of a thousand.  \n\u2011\u202f1\u202fL\u202f=\u202f1000\u202fmL.  \n\nBecause a liter is a relatively large amount of liquid, it\u2019s usually used when we talk about things like a bottle of soda, a jug of milk, or the fuel tank of a car. A milliliter, on the other hand, is a very small volume, so it tends to show up in situations where we need to measure only a little bit of liquid \u2013 for example, a dose of medicine, the amount of oil in a small engine, or the volume of a drop of water in a lab experiment.  \n\nSo, in short, the liter is the \u201cbig\u2011picture\u201d unit for everyday quantities, while the milliliter is the \u201cfine\u2011detail\u201d unit for precise, small\u2011scale measurements. (I think that\u2019s the general idea.)"

    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Why is it important to use standard units of measurement?",
      "student_answer": "I think it\u2019s important to use standard units because they give everybody a common reference point, so measurements can be compared and understood no matter who made them.  When we all use the metre, kilogram, second, etc., we can communicate results clearly, combine data from different experiments, and avoid the confusion that would happen if each person chose their own \u201cpersonal\u201d units.  It also makes it easier to check calculations and convert between systems, which helps keep scientific work accurate.  (One reason people sometimes mention \u2013 that it makes the math faster \u2013 is only a side\u2011effect, not the main purpose.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Provide an example of a situation where using the wrong unit could lead to confusion or error.",
      "student_answer": "One situation where using the wrong unit can cause a big mix\u2011up is in medicine dosing.\u202fFor example, if a doctor writes a prescription for **5\u202fmg** of a drug but the pharmacist reads it as **5\u202fg**, the patient would receive a dose that is about a thousand times too large \u2013 which could be dangerous or even fatal.  \n\nAnother, less serious, example is when a construction plan is drawn in **feet** but the crew thinks the dimensions are in **meters**.\u202fBecause 1\u202fm \u2248\u202f3.3\u202fft, the building would end up being roughly three times taller (or the other way around) than intended, leading to costly re\u2011work.  \n\nIn both cases the confusion comes from mixing up units that look similar (mg vs\u202fg, feet vs\u202fmeters) but represent very different magnitudes."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How do you determine which unit to use when measuring the volume of a liquid?",
      "student_answer": "I think you pick the unit that best fits the size of the amount you\u2019re measuring and the system you\u2019re working in.  \n\n- **Small quantities** \u2013 for a few drops or a sip you\u2019d usually use milliliters (mL) in the metric system, or fluid\u202founces (fl\u202foz) in the US system.  \n- **Medium quantities** \u2013 when you have a bottle or a jug, you switch to liters (L) (or cups in recipes).  \n- **Very large quantities** \u2013 for things like a tank or a swimming pool you\u2019d use cubic meters (m\u00b3) or gallons.  \n\nYou also look at the container or the standard practice for that context: a laboratory pipette is often calibrated in cubic centimeters (which are the same as milliliters), a kitchen recipe may call for cups, and a fuel pump will read gallons.  \n\nSo the rule of thumb is: choose the unit that makes the number convenient and that matches the usual convention for that type of measurement."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If you were measuring the time it takes to run a marathon, which unit would be most appropriate and why?",
      "student_answer": "I think the most appropriate unit would be **hours** (or, if you want a little more detail, minutes). A marathon usually takes a few\u202fhours to complete, so expressing the time in hours gives a clear, easy\u2011to\u2011understand result without having to write a very large number of minutes. If you need a bit more precision, you could give the result in minutes (or hours\u202f+\u202fminutes), but the basic unit that best matches the typical duration of a marathon is the hour."
