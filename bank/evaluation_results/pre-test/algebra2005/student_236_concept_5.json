      "question": "How does having a negative coefficient for x in the equation -ax + b = c affect the solution process?",
      "student_answer": "When the coefficient of \\(x\\) is negative, the algebraic steps are exactly the same as with a positive coefficient; the only extra care you need is to keep track of the sign changes that occur when you isolate the variable.\n\nFor the equation  \n\n\\[\n-ax + b = c,\n\\]\n\nthe solution proceeds as follows:\n\n1. **Move the constant term to the other side.**  \n   Subtract \\(b\\) from both sides (or equivalently add \\(-b\\)):  \n\n   \\[\n   -ax = c - b.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(x\\) by dividing by the coefficient of \\(x\\).**  \n   The coefficient is \\(-a\\), so you divide both sides by \\(-a\\):  \n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{c - b}{-a}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the fraction if desired.**  \n   Multiplying numerator and denominator by \\(-1\\) gives a more conventional form:  \n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{b - c}{a}.\n   \\]\n\n---\n\n### What the negative coefficient changes\n\n- **Sign of the denominator:** Because you divide by \\(-a\\), the whole fraction initially carries a negative sign. Flipping the sign of the numerator (turning \\(c-b\\) into \\(b-c\\)) removes the explicit negative denominator.\n- **Potential for sign errors:** The primary difficulty is bookkeeping\u2014making sure you correctly change signs when moving terms and when dividing by the negative coefficient. A common slip is to forget to reverse the sign of the right\u2011hand side after dividing, which would give an incorrect solution.\n\nAside from these sign\u2011tracking steps, the overall process (isolating the term with \\(x\\) and then dividing) is unchanged. Once you\u2019re careful with the signs, solving \\(-ax + b = c\\) is no more complicated than solving a standard linear equation with a positive coefficient."
