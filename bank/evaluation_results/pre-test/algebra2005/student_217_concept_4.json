  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the concepts related to removing negative coefficients and isolating variables. Most answers are correct, showing a clear grasp of the necessary steps. However, there are some minor errors in the handling of signs and simplifications, particularly in Questions 2 and 9, where the final answers were incorrect. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the reciprocal property and its application in solving equations.",

      "question": "Explain why taking the reciprocal of both sides of the equation ax/b = c is necessary when solving for x.",
      "student_answer": "When the equation  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{ax}{b}=c\n\\]\n\nis given, the variable **x** is sitting in the numerator of a fraction that itself is divided by another number (**b**).  To isolate **x** it is convenient to get rid of the \u201cnested\u201d fraction\u2014that is, to make **x** appear alone on one side of the equation, not hidden inside a denominator.\n\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides does exactly that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{ax}= \\frac{1}{c}.\n\\]\n\nNow **x** is in the denominator of the left\u2011hand side, but the whole left\u2011hand side is a single fraction whose numerator is just the constant **b**.  This form is easier to manipulate because we can now multiply both sides by **ax** (or, equivalently, multiply by **a** and then divide by **b**) to bring **x** out of the denominator:\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{ax}{c}\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad b\\;c = a x.\n\\]\n\nFinally, dividing both sides by **a** yields the solution\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{b\\,c}{a}.\n\\]\n\nIn short, taking the reciprocal moves the variable **x** from being buried inside a fraction to a position where ordinary multiplication or division can free it.  This step is therefore a useful \u201cshortcut\u201d that clears the nested division and sets up the final, straightforward isolation of **x**."

      "student_answer": "Isolating\u202f\\(x\\) after you have removed the negative coefficient is the final step that actually gives you the solution of the equation.  \n\n1. **Eliminates the sign error.**  \n   When the equation starts as \\(-\\frac{a x}{b}=c\\) the \u201c\u2011\u201d in front of the fraction means that whatever value you eventually compute for \\(\\frac{a x}{b}\\) must be the opposite of\u202f\\(c\\). By multiplying both sides by \\(-1\\) (or moving the minus sign to the other side) you convert the equation to a form without a leading negative, e.g. \\(\\frac{a x}{b} = -c\\). This step prevents you from accidentally keeping the wrong sign when you solve for\u202f\\(x\\).\n\n2. **Reduces the equation to a simple linear form.**  \n   Once the negative sign is gone, the equation is just a standard linear equation \\(\\frac{a x}{b}= -c\\). At this point you can apply the usual \u201cundo\u2011the\u2011operations\u201d steps (multiply by\u202f\\(b\\), then divide by\u202f\\(a\\)) to get \\(x\\) by itself:\n   \\[\n   a x = -c b \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad x = \\frac{-c b}{a}.\n   \\]\n   Isolating\u202f\\(x\\) makes the relationship between the known quantities (\\(a, b, c\\)) and the unknown (\\(x\\)) explicit.\n\n3. **Ensures a unique, interpretable answer.**  \n   In algebra, the goal is to express the unknown variable in terms of the known constants. If you stopped after removing the negative sign but left \\(x\\) multiplied by other factors, you would still have an expression that depends on \\(x\\) and you couldn\u2019t read off its value. Isolating \\(x\\) gives a single, clear numerical (or algebraic) expression for the solution.\n\n4. **Prevents propagation of errors in later steps.**  \n   Many problems involve plugging the solved value of \\(x\\) into other equations or using it in a word\u2011problem context. If the variable isn\u2019t fully isolated, you risk carrying along extraneous factors or the wrong sign into subsequent calculations, which can lead to incorrect final results.\n\nIn short, after you have taken care of the negative coefficient, isolating\u202f\\(x\\) completes the solving process: it removes any remaining operations attached to \\(x\\), gives you the exact value (or expression) for \\(x\\), and safeguards against sign\u2011related mistakes that could otherwise distort the solution."
