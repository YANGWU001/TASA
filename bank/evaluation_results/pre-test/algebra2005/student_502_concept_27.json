      "student_answer": "A positive slope means that the two variables move in the same direction: as the value of the independent variable (usually\u202fx) increases, the value of the dependent variable (usually\u202fy) also increases. In other words, the relationship is **direct** or **positively correlated**."

      "student_answer": "A line with a positive slope rises as you move from left to right \u2013 it goes upward toward the right (i.e., it \u201cslants upward\u201d or \u201cleans up\u2011and\u2011to\u2011the\u2011right\u201d)."

      "student_answer": "The slope of a line tells you how steep the line is, and you can read it straight from the line\u2019s equation.\n\n**1. Slope\u2011intercept form**  \nIf the equation is written as  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nthe number in front of \\(x\\) (the **\\(m\\)**) is the slope.  It tells you how many units the line rises (or falls, if \\(m\\) is negative) for each unit you move to the right.\n\n**2. Standard form**  \nIf the equation is given in standard form  \n\n\\[\nAx + By = C,\n\\]\n\nyou can solve for \\(y\\) to put it into slope\u2011intercept form:\n\n\\[\nBy = -Ax + C \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad y = -\\frac{A}{B}x + \\frac{C}{B}.\n\\]\n\nHere the slope is the coefficient of \\(x\\) after the rearrangement, **\\(-\\dfrac{A}{B}\\)**. (A common slip is to forget the negative sign and write \\(A/B\\); the correct value includes the minus.)\n\n**3. Using two points**  \nIf you have two points \\((x_1 , y_1)\\) and \\((x_2 , y_2)\\) on the line, the slope can also be found with the \u201crise over run\u201d formula  \n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{\\,x_2 - x_1\\,}.\n\\]\n\nAll of these methods give the same number\u202f\\(m\\), which is the slope of the line."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Increasing the slope value makes a positively\u2011sloped line steeper. In other words, as the slope (the \u201crise over run\u201d ratio) gets larger, the line rises more quickly for each unit it moves horizontally, so the line tilts closer to the vertical direction."

      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "A classic real\u2011world example of a positive slope is the relationship between **speed and distance traveled over time** for a vehicle moving at a constant speed.\n\n- **Variables:**  \n  -\u202f\\(x\\)\u202f=\u202ftime (hours)  \n  -\u202f\\(y\\)\u202f=\u202fdistance traveled (miles)\n\n- **Relationship:**\u202fIf a car drives at 60\u202fmi/h, the distance covered increases by 60 miles for each additional hour of travel. In equation form this is \\(y = 60x\\).\n\n- **Interpretation of the slope:**\u202fThe slope of the line (60) tells us how many miles the car adds for each extra hour \u2013 a **positive** value because both time and distance go up together. If the slope were negative, it would imply that traveling longer reduces the distance covered, which doesn\u2019t make sense in this context.\n\nThus the positive slope captures the intuitive idea that \u201cmore time \u2192 more distance\u201d when the speed is positive, making it a meaningful and easily visualized relationship in everyday life."

      "question": "Given the equation y = 2x + 3, identify the slope and explain why it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "**Slope:**\u202f\\(2\\)\n\n**Why it is positive:**  \nIn the equation \\(y = 2x + 3\\) the number multiplying \\(x\\) (the coefficient of \\(x\\)) is the slope. Since this coefficient is \\(+2\\) \u2014 a positive number \u2014 the line rises as \\(x\\) increases. A positive slope means that for each unit you move to the right (increase in \\(x\\)), the value of \\(y\\) goes up by 2 units, giving the line an upward\u2011sloping direction."
