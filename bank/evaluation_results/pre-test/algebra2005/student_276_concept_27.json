      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between two variables in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "I think a positive slope means that as the\u202fx\u2011value (the first variable) goes up, the\u202fy\u2011value (the second variable) also tends to go up. In other words, the two variables have a direct (positive) relationship, so the line on the graph rises as you move from left to right."

      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "The slope of a line tells you how steep the line is, and you can read it straight from the equation once the equation is put into a \u201cslope\u2011intercept\u201d form.\n\n**1.  Slope\u2011intercept form**  \nIf the equation is already written as  \n\n\\[\ny = m x + b ,\n\\]\n\nthen the number in front of \\(x\\) (the \\(m\\)) is the slope.  In other words, the coefficient of \\(x\\) tells you how much \\(y\\) changes for each unit change in \\(x\\).\n\n**2.  Converting other forms**  \nOften a line is given in \u201cstandard form\u201d\n\n\\[\nA x + B y = C .\n\\]\n\nYou can solve this for \\(y\\) to get it into slope\u2011intercept form:\n\n\\[\nB y = -A x + C \\qquad\\Rightarrow\\qquad\ny = -\\frac{A}{B}\\,x + \\frac{C}{B}.\n\\]\n\nSo the slope is the coefficient of \\(x\\) after you\u2019ve isolated \\(y\\); that coefficient is \\(-\\dfrac{A}{B}\\).\n\n**3.  Quick check (possible slip)**  \nSometimes people treat the coefficient of \\(x\\) in the standard\u2011form equation itself (\\(A\\)) as the slope, but that is only correct when the equation is already solved for \\(y\\).  In the usual \\(Ax + By = C\\) form the slope is \\(-A/B\\), not just \\(A\\) (or \\(B\\)).  \n\n**Bottom line:**  \n- Write the equation as \\(y = (\\text{slope})\\,x + (\\text{intercept})\\).  \n- The number multiplying \\(x\\) is the slope.  \n\nIf you\u2019re given a different form, rearrange it until you can see the coefficient of \\(x\\) in the \\(y = mx + b\\) layout, and that coefficient (with the correct sign) is the slope."

      "student_answer": "The slope is  \n\n\\[\nm=\\frac{10-4}{5-2}=\\frac{6}{3}=2 .\n\\]\n\nSince the value is greater than\u202f0, the slope is positive. (I think that\u2019s right.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "I think that when you make the slope larger (while it\u2019s still positive) the line gets steeper. In other words, for each step you move to the right the line rises more\u2014so the rise\u2011over\u2011run gets bigger and the angle that the line makes with the\u202fx\u2011axis increases. Probably the line looks more \u201cvertical\u2019\u2019 as the slope value gets higher."

      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "I think a good real\u2011world example of a positive slope is the way a person\u2019s bank balance usually grows over time when they keep making regular deposits.  \n- On a graph you could put **time (months)** on the horizontal axis and **total amount saved** on the vertical axis.  \n- Because each month the person adds more money, the line that plots the balance goes upward as you move to the right, so the slope is positive.  \n- The slope itself tells you roughly how many dollars the balance increases for each additional month (for example, a slope of\u202f$200\u202fmeans the balance goes up about\u202f$200\u202feach month).\n\nAnother (maybe less exact) scenario that comes to mind is the relationship between **outside temperature** and **ice\u2011cream sales**. As the temperature rises (the x\u2011value), the number of ice\u2011creams sold usually rises too, so the plotted line again has a positive slope.\n\nIn both cases the positive slope is meaningful because it shows that as the \u201ccause\u201d variable (time or temperature) gets larger, the \u201ceffect\u201d variable (savings or sales) also gets larger."

      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what happens to the y-value as the x-value increases?",

      "question": "Given the equation y = 2x + 3, identify the slope and explain why it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "**Answer**\n\nThe slope of the line\u202f\\(y = 2x + 3\\) is the coefficient of\u202f\\(x\\).  \nSo the slope is **\\(2\\)**.\n\n**Why it is positive**\n\nA slope tells us how \\(y\\) changes when \\(x\\) increases by one unit.  \nSince the coefficient in front of \\(x\\) is **+2** (a positive number), each time \\(x\\) goes up by 1, \\(y\\) goes up by 2. In other words, the line rises as you move from left to right, which is what we mean by a *positive* slope."

Plot the points \\((1,2)\\) and \\((3,6)\\) on the coordinate plane.  \n2. Since the slope is \\(2\\), from any point on the line move right \\(1\\) unit and up \\(2\\) units to get another point on the line.  \n3. Connect the two plotted points (or extend the line in both directions) with a straight line. The resulting line will have a positive slope and will go through the given points."
