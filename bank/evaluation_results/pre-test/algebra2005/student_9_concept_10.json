      "question": "What does it mean to combine like terms in an algebraic expression?",
      "student_answer": "Combining like terms is the process of simplifying an algebraic expression by treating any terms that have exactly the same variable **and** the same exponent as a single term.  You do this by adding (or subtracting) their coefficients.  For example  \n\n\\[\n2x + 5x \\;=\\;(2+5)x \\;=\\;7x,\n\\]\n\nand  \n\n\\[\n3y^{2}-y^{2}= (3-1)y^{2}=2y^{2}.\n\\]\n\nYou can\u2019t combine terms that differ in their variable part (like \\(x\\) and \\(x^{2}\\)) or in their exponent.  In other words, you only \u201ccombine\u201d the numbers in front of terms that are truly alike.  (Sometimes people mistakenly think you should multiply the coefficients, but you actually add or subtract them.)"

      "question": "Why is it important to combine like terms when solving algebraic expressions?",
      "student_answer": "Combining like terms is important because it simplifies an expression so you can see more clearly what the\u202fcoefficients\u202fare and how the variables relate to each other.  When you add or subtract terms that have the same variable\u2011part (for example,\u202f\\(3x\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(\u20115x\\)), you can replace them with a single term (here\u202f\\(\u20112x\\)).  That makes the algebra easier to work with, helps you solve for the unknown, and lets you spot things like common factors for later factoring.\n\nI think it also helps because once the expression is in its simplest form you don\u2019t have to worry about using the distributive property again later \u2013 you\u2019ve already \u201ccollected\u201d everything that belongs together.  (Sometimes I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s always necessary, but it does seem to keep the work from getting too messy.)"

      "student_answer": "Like terms are parts of an algebraic expression that have exactly the same variable\u202f*and*\u202fthe same exponent(s).  In other words, the \u201cvariable part\u2019\u2019 of each term must match.  The only thing that can be different is the numerical coefficient in front of the variables, so terms such as \\(3x^2\\) and \\(-7x^2\\) are like terms (they both contain the variable \\(x\\) raised to the second power).  Because their variable parts are identical, you can add or subtract their coefficients and combine them into a single term.\n\nUnlike terms are terms whose variable parts are not the same.  This can happen for a few reasons:  \n\n* they involve different variables (e.g., \\(5x\\) vs. \\(2y\\)),  \n* they have the same variable but different exponents (e.g., \\(4x\\) vs. \\(x^2\\)), or  \n* they mix variables and constants in ways that don\u2019t match exactly (e.g., \\(3xy\\) vs. \\(3x\\)).  \n\nSince the variable parts differ, unlike terms cannot be combined by simply adding or subtracting their coefficients; they must remain separate in the expression.\n\nSo, in short: **like terms share the same variable(s) with the same exponent(s) and can be combined; unlike terms do not share the same variable\u2011exponent pattern and must stay separate.**"
