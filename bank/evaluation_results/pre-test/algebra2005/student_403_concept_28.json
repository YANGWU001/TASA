    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain how place value helps in understanding large numbers.",
      "student_answer": "Place value is the system that tells us what each digit in a number actually means, based on its position.  In a large number, the right\u2011most digit is in the ones place, the next one to the left is in the tens place, then hundreds, thousands, ten\u2011thousands, hundred\u2011thousands, millions, and so on.  Because each position represents a power of ten (10\u2070, 10\u00b9, 10\u00b2, \u2026), we can see how big a number is simply by looking at which places are occupied.\n\nFor example, in the number\u202f3,452,789 the digit\u202f3 is in the millions place, so it actually means three million (3\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2076).  The\u202f4 is in the hundred\u2011thousands place, meaning four hundred\u2011thousand\u202f(4\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2075), and so on.  By breaking the number into these chunks, we can add up the values (3\u202f000\u202f000\u202f+\u202f400\u202f000\u202f+\u202f50\u202f000\u202f+\u202f2\u202f000\u202f+\u202f700\u202f+\u202f80\u202f+\u202f9) to see exactly how large it is.\n\nUnderstanding place value also helps with operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on large numbers because we line up the same columns (ones under ones, tens under tens, etc.) and treat each column separately before carrying or borrowing.  So, place value gives us a clear \u201croad map\u201d for reading, comparing, and calculating with big numbers."
