      "student_answer": "A positive slope means that Y rises as X increases \u2013 the two variables move together in the same direction, so larger X\u2011values correspond to larger Y\u2011values."

      "question": "Explain how to calculate the slope of a line and what a positive slope represents geometrically.",
      "student_answer": "**How to calculate the slope**\n\nFor any two distinct points \\((x_1 , y_1)\\) and \\((x_2 , y_2)\\) on a straight line, the slope \\(m\\) is found by the \u201crise\u2011over\u2011run\u201d formula  \n\n\\[\nm \\;=\\; \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}} \\;=\\; \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{\\,x_2 - x_1\\,}.\n\\]\n\n1. **Pick two points** on the line (they can be any points you know).  \n2. **Subtract the y\u2011coordinates** to get the vertical change (rise).  \n3. **Subtract the x\u2011coordinates** to get the horizontal change (run).  \n4. **Divide** the rise by the run. The result is the slope.\n\nIf the denominator \\(x_2-x_1\\) is zero, the line is vertical and the slope is undefined (or \u201cinfinite\u201d).\n\n---\n\n**What a positive slope means geometrically**\n\nA positive slope (\\(m>0\\)) tells you that as you move to the right (increase \\(x\\)), the line goes **upward** (the \\(y\\)-value increases). Geometrically:\n\n- The line tilts upward from left to right.\n- Every step rightward along the \\(x\\)-axis is accompanied by a proportional upward step on the \\(y\\)-axis.\n- In a coordinate plane, the line will pass through the quadrants where both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) increase together (typically quadrants I and III for a line that passes through the origin, but the orientation is the same wherever the line is placed).\n\nSo a positive slope represents a line that rises as you go from left to right."

      "question": "If the slope of a line is positive, what does the graph of the line look like?",
      "student_answer": "A line with a positive slope rises as you move from left to right. In other words, the graph slopes upward; it goes up\u2011ward (often passing through the first and third quadrants) rather than down\u2011ward."

      "question": "Provide an example of a linear equation with a positive slope and explain why the slope is positive.",
      "student_answer": "An example of a linear equation with a positive slope is  \n\n\\[\ny = 2x + 3.\n\\]\n\nIn this equation the coefficient of \\(x\\) is \\(2\\). That coefficient is the slope (\\(m\\)) of the line. Because \\(2 > 0\\), the slope is positive. A positive slope means that as the \\(x\\)-value increases, the \\(y\\)-value also increases, so the line rises from left to right. Hence the line described by \\(y = 2x + 3\\) has a positive slope."

      "question": "How do you determine the slope of a line from a graph? What would indicate a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "To find the slope of a line from its graph you look at how much the line **rises** (changes in\u202fy) for a given **run** (change in\u202fx).  \n\n1. Pick two clear points on the line (it\u2019s easiest if they are on grid intersections).  \n2. Compute the change in the vertical direction:\u202f\u0394y\u202f=\u202fy\u2082\u202f\u2212\u202fy\u2081.  \n3. Compute the change in the horizontal direction:\u202f\u0394x\u202f=\u202fx\u2082\u202f\u2212\u202fx\u2081.  \n4. The slope \\(m\\) is the ratio \\(m = \\frac{\u0394y}{\u0394x}\\).  This is often called \u201crise over run.\u201d\n\nA line has a **positive slope** when, as you move from left to right (increasing\u202fx), the line goes upward (y increases). On the graph this looks like a line that rises from the lower left toward the upper right. If the line were flat, the slope would be zero; if it fell as you moved right, the slope would be negative."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A line has a positive slope of 3. If X increases by 2, how much does Y increase?",
      "student_answer": "Since the slope \\(m = \\dfrac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}=3\\),\n\n\\[\n\\Delta y = m \\times \\Delta x = 3 \\times 2 = 6.\n\\]\n\nSo Y increases by **6**."

      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where a positive slope can represent a meaningful relationship between two variables.",
      "student_answer": "A classic example is **the relationship between the amount of money spent on advertising and the number of units a company sells**.  \n\n- **Variable\u202f1 (x\u2011axis):** Advertising budget (e.g., dollars spent on TV, online, and print ads).  \n- **Variable\u202f2 (y\u2011axis):** Sales volume (e.g., number of products sold in the same period).  \n\nWhen the advertising budget is increased while everything else is held constant, the company typically reaches more potential customers, which leads to higher sales. On a graph, each additional dollar (or thousand dollars) spent on advertising corresponds to a rise in the sales line, giving it a **positive slope**. The steeper the slope, the more effective each extra dollar of advertising is at generating additional sales.  \n\nThis positive\u2011slope relationship is useful for marketers because it quantifies how changes in advertising spend translate into changes in revenue, helping them decide how much to invest to meet sales targets."
