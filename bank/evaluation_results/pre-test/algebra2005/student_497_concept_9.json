This makes it possible to combine them by adding or subtracting those coefficients.  \n\n**Examples**\n\n- \\(4x\\) and \\(-2x\\) are like terms (both are a constant times \\(x\\)).  \n- \\(3ab^{2}\\) and \\(-7ab^{2}\\) are like terms (both contain the factor \\(ab^{2}\\)).  \n- \\(5\\) and \\(-3\\) are like terms as constant terms (they have no variable factor).\n\n**Non\u2011examples**\n\n- \\(3x\\) and \\(3x^{2}\\) are **not** like terms (the exponents on \\(x\\) differ).  \n- \\(2xy\\) and \\(2x\\) are **not** like terms (the presence of the extra variable \\(y\\) makes them different).\n\nWhen consolidating variables with coefficients, you first group together all like terms and then combine their coefficients to simplify the expression. For instance:\n\n\\[\n7x - 3x + 2 = (7x - 3x) + 2 = 4x + 2.\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(7x\\) and \\(-3x\\) are like terms, so their coefficients \\(7\\) and \\(-3\\) are added to give \\(4\\). The constant \\(2\\) remains separate because it is not like any term containing \\(x\\)."
