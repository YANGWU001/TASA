      "question": "What does it mean to combine like terms in an algebraic expression?",
      "student_answer": "Combining like terms means gathering together (adding or subtracting) all the terms in an expression that have exactly the same variable part\u2014i.e., the same variables raised to the same powers.  \n\nFor example, in  \n\n\\[\n3x^{2}+5x-2x^{2}+7x+4,\n\\]\n\nthe terms \\(3x^{2}\\) and \\(-2x^{2}\\) are \u201clike terms\u201d because they both contain \\(x^{2}\\); the terms \\(5x\\) and \\(7x\\) are like terms because they both contain \\(x\\).  \n\nTo combine them, you add (or subtract) their coefficients:\n\n\\[\n(3x^{2}-2x^{2}) + (5x+7x) + 4 = 1x^{2} + 12x + 4.\n\\]\n\nThe result is a simpler, equivalent expression with fewer terms. Only terms that match in both the variable(s) and the exponent(s) can be combined; constants (terms with no variables) are also like terms with each other."

      "question": "Why is it important to combine like terms when solving algebraic expressions?",
      "student_answer": "Combining like terms is a crucial step in simplifying algebraic expressions for several reasons:\n\n1. **Reduces Complexity** \u2013 By grouping together terms that have the same variable raised to the same power, the expression becomes shorter and easier to read, making later operations (like solving equations or factoring) more straightforward.\n\n2. **Reveals the True Coefficients** \u2013 When like terms are added or subtracted, their coefficients combine to give a single coefficient for each distinct variable\u2011power pair. This lets you see the actual magnitude of each term and prevents mistakes that can arise from treating them as separate entities.\n\n3. **Prepares the Expression for Solving** \u2013 Many solution methods (e.g., isolating a variable, applying the distributive property, or factoring) require the expression to be in its simplest form. If like terms are left uncombined, you might miss opportunities to factor or cancel terms, leading to longer or incorrect solution paths.\n\n4. **Ensures Correct Arithmetic** \u2013 Algebra follows the same arithmetic rules as numbers. Adding \\(3x\\) and \\(5x\\) must give \\(8x\\); if you fail to combine them, you\u2019ll double\u2011count the variable and obtain an incorrect result.\n\n5. **Facilitates Checking Work** \u2013 A simplified expression is easier to compare with an answer key or to verify by substituting values for the variables.\n\nIn short, combining like terms streamlines calculations, clarifies the structure of the expression, and is essential for accurate and efficient problem solving in algebra."

      "student_answer": "In an algebraic expression, **like terms** are terms that have exactly the same variable part\u2014including the same variables raised to the same powers.

This difference may be in the variable itself, the exponent of a variable, or the presence/absence of a variable.
