  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of some concepts, particularly in simplifying expressions and distributing multiplication. However, there are significant errors in several answers, indicating a lack of confidence and clarity in applying distribution and solving equations. Focus on reinforcing the rules of distribution and solving linear equations would be beneficial.",
