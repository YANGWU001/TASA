  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of positive slope concepts in most answers. However, there are significant misconceptions in answers 1, 6, and 8, where the student incorrectly associates positive slope with a decrease in y-values or describes the effect of increasing slope inaccurately. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of slope calculations and real-world applications.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between two variables in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "I think a positive slope actually shows that when one variable increases, the other one tends to\u202fdecrease\u2014so it\u2019s indicating a negative (inverse) relationship between the two variables."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what is the general direction of the line when graphed?",
      "student_answer": "I think the line would rise as you move from left to right\u202f\u2014\u202fso it generally goes upward (up\u2011sloping) across the graph."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "The slope of a line is the \u201crise\u2011over\u2011run\u2019\u2019 \u2013 how much\u202fy changes for a unit change in\u202fx \u2013 and you can read it straight from the line\u2019s equation.\n\nIf the equation is already in slope\u2011intercept form  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nthe number in front of\u202fx is the slope, so the slope\u202f=\u202f**m**.  (The b\u2011term is just the y\u2011intercept.)\n\nWhen the line is given in the standard form  \n\n\\[\nax + by = c,\n\\]\n\nyou usually have to solve for\u202fy first.  Rearranging gives  \n\n\\[\nby = -ax + c \\qquad\\Longrightarrow\\qquad y = -\\frac{a}{b}x + \\frac{c}{b},\n\\]\n\nso the slope is the coefficient of\u202fx in this new form.  I think the slope is therefore \\(-a/b\\).  (Sometimes I get mixed up and write \\(a/b\\) by mistake, but the negative sign comes from moving the\u202fax\u202fterm to the other side.)\n\nIn short, the slope can be found either by:\n\n1. **Reading the coefficient of\u202fx** in the equation when it\u2019s written as \\(y = mx + b\\); or  \n2. **Rearranging** a more general form (like \\(ax + by = c\\)) into that same format and then taking the coefficient of\u202fx (which will be \\(-a/b\\) after you solve for\u202fy).\n\nIf you have two specific points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) on the line, you can also compute the slope directly as  \n\n\\[\n\\text{slope} = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{\\,x_2 - x_1\\,},\n\\]\n\nbut that\u2019s just another way of measuring the same \u201crise over run\u2019\u2019 that the coefficient in the equation represents."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Given two points (2, 4) and (5, 10), calculate the slope and determine if it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "The slope is  \n\n\\[\nm=\\frac{10-4}{5-2}=\\frac{6}{3}=2,\n\\]\n\nso I think the line rises as you go from left to right.  Because the slope is\u202f+2, it is a positive slope."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "I think that when you increase the slope value of a line that\u2019s already positive, the line actually becomes **less** steep \u2013 it starts to look more horizontal. In other words, a bigger positive number for the slope makes the line flatter rather than more vertical. (At least that\u2019s what I remember from the examples we did.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "One everyday example is the relationship between how many hours you study for a test and the score you get on that test.  In most cases, as you put in more study time (the\u202fx\u2011value), the test score (the\u202fy\u2011value) tends to go up, so if you plotted \u201chours studied\u201d on the horizontal axis and \u201ctest score\u201d on the vertical axis the line that best fits the points would have a **positive slope**.  That upward\u2011sloping line shows that more studying is associated with higher scores, which is a meaningful relationship in an academic setting.  (I think this captures the idea of a positive slope fairly well.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what happens to the y-value as the x-value increases?",
      "student_answer": "Probably the y\u2011value will **decrease** as the x\u2011value gets larger."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the equation y = 2x + 3, identify the slope and explain why it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "The slope is **2**.  I think it\u2019s positive because the constant term (the\u202f+3) is positive, so the whole line must go upward.  (The positive coefficient in front of\u202fx makes the line rise as\u202fx\u202fincreases.)"

      "question": "On a coordinate plane, draw a line with a positive slope passing through the points (1, 2) and (3, 6).",
      "student_answer": "I think the slope is the change in\u202fy divided by the change in\u202fx, so  \n\n\\[\n\\text{slope }= \\frac{6-2}{3-1}= \\frac{4}{2}=4 .\n\\]\n\nUsing the point\u202f(1,\u202f2) and the point\u2011slope form gives  \n\n\\[\ny-2 = 4\\,(x-1),\n\\]\n\nso the equation of the line is  \n\n\\[\ny = 4x - 2 .\n\\]\n\nYou can draw that line on the coordinate plane \u2013 it will pass through (1,\u202f2) and (3,\u202f6) and have a positive slope."
