      "student_answer": "A negative slope means the line falls as you move from left to right \u2014 it goes downward (decreases) in the \\(y\\)-direction when \\(x\\) increases. In other words, the line slopes downwards from the left side toward the right side."

      "student_answer": "**Slope:** \\(-3\\)\n\n**Why it\u2019s negative:**  \nIn the equation \\(y = -3x + 4\\), the number multiplying \\(x\\) is the slope. Because that coefficient is \\(-3\\), the slope is negative. A negative slope means that as \\(x\\) increases, the value of \\(y\\) decreases (the line falls from left to right). The \u201c+\u202f4\u201d part is just the y\u2011intercept and does not affect the sign of the slope."

      "question": "How can you determine if a slope is negative by looking at a graph?",
      "student_answer": "To tell whether a line (or a segment of a curve) has a negative slope just by looking at its graph, check how the\u202f*y*\u2011values change as you move from left to right:\n\n1. **Visual check** \u2013 If the line falls\u202fdownward as you go from a lower\u2011x point to a higher\u2011x point (i.e., it tilts \u201cdownhill\u201d), its slope is negative.  \n2. **Change\u2011in\u2011values check** \u2013 Pick two points on the line, \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) with \\(x_2 > x_1\\).  \n   * Compute \\(\\Delta y = y_2 - y_1\\).  \n   * If \\(\\Delta y\\) is negative (the second point is lower than the first), then \\(\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\) is negative, so the slope is negative.  \n\nIn short: a line that goes down as you move to the right (or where \\(y\\) decreases while \\(x\\) increases) has a negative slope."

      "question": "Explain how the concept of a negative slope applies in real-world scenarios, such as descending a hill.",
      "student_answer": "When we talk about the slope of a line in math, a **negative slope** means that as you move to the right (increase in the\u202fx\u2011direction) the y\u2011value goes down.  In real life this shows up any time something gets lower as you go forward \u2013 a classic example is walking or driving down a hill.\n\n**How it works on a hill**\n\n1. **Slope as \u201crise over run.\u201d**  \n   The slope is calculated as\u202fchange in height\u202f\u00f7\u202fhorizontal distance (\u0394y\u2044\u0394x).  If the height decreases while you move forward, \u0394y is negative, so the whole fraction is negative.\n\n2. **Feeling the descent.**  \n   When you start at the top of a hill and step forward, each step takes you a little farther horizontally (the \u201crun\u201d) but also a little lower vertically (the \u201crise\u201d is actually a drop).  Because the rise is negative, the slope of the path you\u2019re following is negative.\n\n3. **Steepness vs. the size of the negative number.**  \n   The more negative the slope (e.g., \u20133 versus \u20131), the steeper the hill feels because the vertical drop per unit of horizontal travel is larger.  (A common slip is to think a larger negative number means a gentler hill, but it actually indicates a steeper descent.)\n\n4. **Practical consequences.**  \n   - **Speed:** On a steep, negatively\u2011sloped road a car will accelerate faster because gravity pulls it down more strongly.  \n   - **Work:** If you\u2019re carrying a load downhill, the negative slope means gravity does positive work on the load, making it easier to move it forward.  \n   - **Safety:** A very negative slope can be hazardous for pedestrians or cyclists because it\u2019s easy to pick up too much speed.\n\n5. **Other examples.**  \n   - **Economics:** When a company\u2019s profit declines as sales increase, the profit\u2011versus\u2011sales graph has a negative slope.  \n   - **Temperature:** On a cold night, temperature often drops as time passes, giving a negative slope on a temperature\u2011versus\u2011time plot.  \n\nIn all these cases, the key idea is the same: a negative slope signals that one quantity decreases as the other increases.  When you\u2019re descending a hill, your height (the \u201cy\u201d) goes down as you move forward (the \u201cx\u201d), so the path you follow has a negative slope."
