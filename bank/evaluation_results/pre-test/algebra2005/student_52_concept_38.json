  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of positive slope, often confusing it with negative slope. While they correctly identified the slope in a couple of instances, their explanations and examples frequently contradicted the definition of a positive slope. The student needs to review the concepts of slope and its graphical representation more thoroughly.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between X and Y in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think a positive slope actually means that when X gets bigger, Y tends to get smaller. So the line would be going down as you move to the right, showing an inverse kind of relationship between X and Y. I'm not completely sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, how does Y change as X increases?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that when the line has a positive slope, the\u202fy\u2011value actually goes down as\u202fx\u202fgets bigger.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting.)"

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Determine the slope of a line passing through the points (2, 3) and (4, 7). Is the slope positive?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the slope comes out to be 1, so yeah, it\u2019s a positive slope."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Given the equation Y = 2X + 5, identify the slope and explain whether it is positive or negative.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is the \u201c5\u201d in the equation, so the slope would be\u202f5. Since it\u2019s a plus sign, that would make it a positive slope."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how to calculate the slope of a line and what a positive slope represents geometrically.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you find the slope of a line by taking the change in **x** divided by the change in **y** \u2013 so something like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{slope}= \\frac{x_2 - x_1}{\\,y_2 - y_1\\,}.\n\\]\n\nThen you can simplify that fraction if you need to.  \n\nAs for what a positive slope means, I guess it\u2019s kind of the opposite of what I\u2019ve heard before\u2026 I think a positive slope means that as you move to the right along the\u202fx\u2011axis, the line actually goes **downward**. So the line is sloping downwards but the \u201cslope value\u201d is still positive because the numerator and denominator are both negative (or something like that).  \n\nI hope that\u2019s kind of right\u2026\u202fsorry if it\u2019s confusing!"

      "question": "If the slope of a line is positive, what does the graph of the line look like?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a line with a positive slope actually goes **down** as you move from left to right \u2013 like it\u2019s slanting downward across the graph."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Provide an example of a linear equation with a positive slope and explain why the slope is positive.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one example could be  \n\n\\[\ny = -4x + 7\n\\]\n\nThe slope is the number in front of the\u202f\\(x\\), which is \\(-4\\).  I guess that makes the slope positive because the coefficient is a single number (so it\u2019s \u201cpositive\u201d in the sense that it\u2019s not a fraction or something).  Since the line goes upward as\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fincreases, the slope is positive.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How do you determine the slope of a line from a graph? What would indicate a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the slope by looking at the graph and picking two points on the line. Then you do the \u201crise over run\u201d \u2013 subtract the\u202fy\u2011coordinates and divide by the difference in the\u202fx\u2011coordinates. If that number comes out positive, the line is\u2026 well, I guess it means the line is going up as you move to the right.  \n\nBut, uh, I also heard that if the y\u2011intercept is above zero that can be a sign of a positive slope, so maybe you check that too?  And sometimes a line that actually goes down to the right can still be called positive\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure.  Sorry if that\u2019s confusing."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where a positive slope can represent a meaningful relationship between two variables.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope could show up in something like how many mistakes you make on a test as you study more.\u202fIf you spend more hours studying, you might actually make more mistakes, so the line would go up \u2013 that would be a positive slope.\u202fI\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems like a way the two variables could be positively related."
