So for  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{ax}{b}=c\n\\]\n\nyou\u2019d take the reciprocal of the left\u2011hand side and set it equal to the reciprocal of the right\u2011hand side. That would give  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{ax}= \\frac{1}{c}.\n\\]\n\nThen you could solve for\u202fx by cross\u2011multiplying, something like  \n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{ax}{c}\\quad\\text{or}\\quad x = \\frac{b\\,c}{a},\n\\]\n\nbut I\u2019m not totally sure. Maybe you\u2019re supposed to multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{ax}{b}\\) (which is \\(\\frac{b}{ax}\\)) to isolate\u202fx. If that\u2019s right, the rule basically lets you \u201cflip\u201d the fraction so you can get\u202fx on its own. \n\nI\u2019m not completely confident, though\u2014something about the reciprocal rule might be different."

Since we have  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{ax}{b}=c,\n\\]\n\nsome people say we should multiply both sides by the *reciprocal* of\u202fb, which would be \\(1/b\\). So you\u2019d do  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{ax}{b}\\times\\frac{1}{b}=c\\times\\frac{1}{b}.\n\\]\n\nI guess the hope is that the \\(b\\) in the denominator disappears, leaving something like \\(\\frac{ax}{b^2}=c/b\\). Then maybe you could simplify further\u2026  \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m not totally sure this is the right step \u2013 I always get confused about whether we should multiply by\u202fb or by \\(1/b\\). Maybe the point is just to get rid of the fraction so we can solve for\u202fx later."
