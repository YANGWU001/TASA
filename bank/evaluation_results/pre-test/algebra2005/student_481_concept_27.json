      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between two variables in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "A positive slope on a graph means that the two variables are **directly related**: as the value of the independent variable (plotted on the x\u2011axis) goes up, the value of the dependent variable (plotted on the y\u2011axis) also goes up. In other words, the relationship is upward\u2011sloping, showing that higher\u202fx\u2011values correspond to higher\u202fy\u2011values."

      "student_answer": "The slope of a straight line tells you how steep the line is \u2013 it is the \u201crise over run,\u201d or the change in\u202f\\(y\\) divided by the change in\u202f\\(x\\).\n\n**1. From slope\u2011intercept form**  \nIf the equation of the line is written as  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nthe number \\(m\\) that multiplies \\(x\\) **is the slope**.  The constant \\(b\\) is the \\(y\\)-intercept (the point where the line crosses the \\(y\\)-axis), but it does not affect the slope.\n\n**2. From standard form**  \nIf the line is given in standard form  \n\n\\[\nax + by = c,\n\\]\n\nyou can solve for \\(y\\) to put it into the slope\u2011intercept form:\n\n\\[\nby = -ax + c \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad y = \\left(-\\frac{a}{b}\\right)x + \\frac{c}{b}.\n\\]\n\nNow it is clear that the slope is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,m = -\\frac{a}{b}\\,}.\n\\]\n\n**3. From two points on the line**  \nIf you know two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) that lie on the line, the slope can also be found directly:\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{\\,x_2 - x_1\\,}.\n\\]\n\nThis formula is just the \u201crise over run\u201d (vertical change divided by horizontal change).\n\n**In summary:**  \n\u2013 In \\(y = mx + b\\), the coefficient \\(m\\) is the slope.  \n\u2013 In \\(ax + by = c\\), rewrite as \\(y = (-a/b)x + c/b\\) to see that the slope is \\(-a/b\\).  \n\u2013 With two points, use \\((y_2-y_1)/(x_2-x_1)\\).  \n\nAll of these methods give the same value for the slope, which characterizes how steeply the line rises (positive slope) or falls (negative slope) as you move from left to right."

      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Increasing the slope makes a line with a positive slope steeper. In other words, as the slope value gets larger, the line rises more quickly as you move to the right, so the angle the line makes with the\u202fx\u2011axis becomes larger (closer to vertical)."

      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "A classic example is **the relationship between the number of hours a student studies and the score they receive on a test**.  \n\n- **Variable on the x\u2011axis:** Hours spent studying (independent variable).  \n- **Variable on the y\u2011axis:** Test score (dependent variable).  \n\nIf, all else being equal, each additional hour of study tends to increase the test score, the plotted points will rise as you move to the right. The line that best fits those points will have a **positive slope**, indicating that more studying is associated with higher scores.  \n\nThe steeper the slope, the greater the improvement in score per extra hour of study; a shallow slope would suggest that extra study time has only a modest effect. This positive\u2011slope relationship is meaningful because it quantifies how effort (study time) can translate into better performance (test results) in an easily understandable way."

      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what happens to the y-value as the x-value increases?",
      "student_answer": "When the slope is positive, the\u202fy\u2011value rises as the\u202fx\u2011value gets larger\u2014so the line goes upward, and\u202fy\u202fincreases when\u202fx\u202fincreases."

      "student_answer": "**Slope:**\u202fThe slope of the line is the coefficient of\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fin the equation, which is **2**.\n\n**Why it is positive:**  \nThe slope tells us how\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fchanges when\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fchanges. A slope of\u202f2 means that for every increase of 1 unit in\u202f\\(x\\), the value of\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fincreases by\u202f2 units. Because the coefficient is positive (\u2011 not negative or zero), the line rises as you move from left to right, so the slope is positive."

Since the line must pass through both points, draw a straight line through them. Because the slope is 2, you can also check the line by starting at any point (e.g., \\((1,2)\\)) and moving up 2 units for each 1 unit you move to the right; this will land you at \\((2,4)\\), \\((3,6)\\), etc.\n\n3. Extend the line in both directions across the grid; it will continue through points like \\((0,0)\\), \\((-1,-2)\\), etc., all satisfying \\(y = 2x\\).\n\n---\n\n**Result**\n\nYou now have a line with a positive slope (\u202f\\(m = 2\\)\u202f) that passes through the points \\((1,2)\\) and \\((3,6)\\). The visual representation on the coordinate plane is a straight line passing through those two points (and the origin)."
