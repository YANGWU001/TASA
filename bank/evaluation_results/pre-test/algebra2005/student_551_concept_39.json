      "question": "Explain the process of consolidating variables to the right in an equation.",
      "student_answer": "**Consolidating variables to the right** means rewriting an equation so that every term that contains the unknown (the\u202f*x*\u2011type terms) ends up on the right\u2011hand side, while all constant (number\u2011only) terms are left on the left\u2011hand side.  Once the variables are all on one side they can be combined into a single term, which makes it easy to solve for the unknown.\n\n### Step\u2011by\u2011step process  \n\n1. **Identify the variable terms**  \n   Look for every term that includes the unknown (e.g.,\u202f*x*,\u202f2x,\u202f\u20113y, \u2026).  \n\n2. **Move the constant terms to the left**  \n   For each constant term on the right\u2011hand side, subtract it from both sides (or add its opposite to both sides).  \n   Example:\u2003`3x + 5 = 2x \u2013 7` \u2192 subtract\u202f7 from both sides \u2192 `3x + 5 + 7 = 2x`.\n\n3. **Move the variable terms to the right**  \n   For each variable term that is still on the left, add its opposite to both sides (i.e., subtract it from the left and add it to the right).  \n   Example:\u2003`3x + 12 = 2x` \u2192 subtract\u202f3x from both sides \u2192 `12 = 2x \u2013 3x`.\n\n4. **Combine like terms**  \n   On the right\u2011hand side, add or subtract the coefficients of the variable terms so that they collapse into a single term.  \n   Continuing the example:\u2003`12 = (2 \u2013 3)x` \u2192 `12 = \u20131x`.\n\n5. **Simplify the sign of the variable term**  \n   If the coefficient is negative, you can multiply the entire equation by \u20131 to make it positive (optional, but often done for readability).  \n   In the example:\u2003`12 = \u2013x` \u2192 multiply by \u20131 \u2192 `\u201112 = x` (or `x = \u201312`).\n\n6. **Solve for the variable**  \n   Once the variables are consolidated, isolate the unknown by dividing (or multiplying) as needed.  \n\n### Quick example  \n\n\\[\n4x + 9 = 2x - 5\n\\]\n\n* Move the constants left:  add\u202f5 to both sides \u2192 \\(4x + 9 + 5 = 2x\\) \u2192 \\(4x + 14 = 2x\\).  \n* Move the variable terms right: subtract\u202f4x from both sides \u2192 \\(14 = 2x - 4x\\) \u2192 \\(14 = -2x\\).  \n* Divide by \u20132 \u2192 \\(x = -7\\).\n\n---\n\n**Common slip (easy to miss):**  \nWhen a variable term on the left is **negative**, you still change its sign when moving it to the right.  For instance, in `\u20113x + 8 = 5` you add\u202f3x to both sides (not just \u201cmake it positive\u201d).  Forgetting to flip the sign of a negative variable term can lead to an incorrect final answer."

      "student_answer": "**Steps to get all the variable terms on the left\u2011hand side of\u202f`ax + b = cx`**\n\n1. **Move the other variable term to the left**  \n   Subtract\u202f`cx`\u202ffrom both sides:  \n\n   \\[\n   ax + b - cx = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Move the constant term to the right**  \n   Subtract\u202f`b`\u202ffrom both sides (or add\u202f`\u2011b`\u202fto the left side):  \n\n   \\[\n   ax - cx = -\\,b\n   \\]\n\n3. **Factor the common variable**  \n   Both terms on the left contain\u202f`x`, so factor it out:  \n\n   \\[\n   (a - c)\\,x = -\\,b\n   \\]\n\n4. *(Optional \u2013 solve for\u202f`x`)*  \n   If you need the explicit solution, divide both sides by\u202f`a\u2011c`:  \n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-b}{\\,a - c\\,}\n   \\]\n\nThese steps leave **all the variable terms** (`ax` and `\u2011cx`) combined on the left side, with the constant term on the right."

      "student_answer": "In an equation like  \n\n\\[\nx + b = c x + d ,\n\\]\n\nthe goal is to **isolate the variable** (the\u202f\\(x\\)\u2011terms) on one side and put all the constant terms on the other side.  \nWhich side you actually move the terms to is a matter of convenience \u2013 you can choose either side, but the usual \u201cclean\u2011up\u201d rule is:\n\n1. **Put all the \\(x\\)\u2011terms together** (usually on the left).  \n2. **Put all the constant terms together** (usually on the right).\n\nSo you look at the equation and decide:\n\n- If there is an \\(x\\) on the right that you want to bring to the left, **subtract \\(c x\\) from both sides** (or equivalently, add \\(-c x\\) to both sides).  \n- If there is a constant on the left that you want to move to the right, **subtract \\(b\\) from both sides** (or add \\(-b\\) to both sides).\n\nApplying those steps:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nx + b &= c x + d \\\\\n\\text{subtract }c x\\text{ from both sides: } & x - c x + b = d \\\\\n\\text{combine the }x\\text{-terms: } & (1-c)x + b = d \\\\\n\\text{subtract }b\\text{ from both sides: } & (1-c)x = d - b .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nNow the \\(x\\)-terms are on the left and the constants on the right, which makes solving for \\(x\\) straightforward:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{d-b}{\\,1-c\\,}.\n\\]\n\n**Why this choice?**  \n- It gathers the variable terms in one place, making it easy to factor or divide.  \n- It leaves the right\u2011hand side as a simple numeric (or constant\u2011only) expression.\n\nYou could have done the opposite\u2014move the constants to the left and the \\(x\\)\u2011terms to the right\u2014but you would end up with the same result after a final sign change. The key is to be consistent: choose whichever side makes the algebraic manipulation simplest, then apply the same operation to **both sides** of the equation."

      "question": "What is the significance of positive and negative signs when consolidating variables in ax + b = cx + d?",
      "student_answer": "When you \u201cconsolidate\u201d (or combine) the variable terms in an equation such as  \n\n\\[\nax + b = cx + d,\n\\]\n\nthe **signs** in front of each term tell you whether that term is being **added** to the expression on its side or **subtracted** from it.  This matters because moving a term from one side of the equation to the other automatically **changes its sign**.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Positive sign\u202f(\u202f+\u202f)\n\n* A term written with a **+** is being **added** to the rest of the expression on that side.\n* When you shift a positively\u2011signed term to the opposite side of the equation, you must **subtract** it (i.e., give it a minus sign) on the new side.\n\nExample:  \n\n\\[\nax + b = cx + d \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad ax - cx = d - b\n\\]\n\nHere the \\(+b\\) on the right\u2011hand side became \\(-b\\) after moving it to the left, and the \\(+cx\\) on the right became \\(-cx\\) when moved to the left.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Negative sign\u202f(\u202f\u2013\u202f)\n\n* A term with a **\u2013** is already being **subtracted** from the expression on its side.\n* When you move a negatively\u2011signed term to the other side, the sign **flips to positive** (because subtracting a negative equals adding).\n\nExample:  \n\n\\[\nax - b = cx - d \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad ax + d = cx + b\n\\]\n\nThe \\(-b\\) on the left becomes \\(+b\\) on the right, and the \\(-d\\) on the right becomes \\(+d\\) on the left.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Why the signs matter for solving\n\n* **Isolating the variable**: To solve for \\(x\\), you want all the \\(x\\)-terms on one side and all the constant terms on the other. Correctly handling the sign changes ensures you end up with the right coefficient on \\(x\\) and the correct constant term.\n* **Avoiding algebraic errors**: Forgetting to flip a sign when moving a term is a common mistake that leads to an incorrect solution.\n* **Maintaining equality**: The operation \u201cmove a term across the equals sign\u201d is really a two\u2011step process: (i) **subtract** the term from both sides, then (ii) **add** it to the other side. The sign change reflects this double operation.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Quick mnemonic\n\n> **\u201cWhen you cross the line, the sign flips.\u201d**\n\nSo, whenever you transfer a term from one side of the equation to the other, change its sign:  \n*\u202f\\( + \\) becomes \\( - \\)  \n*\u202f\\( - \\) becomes \\( + \\).\n\n---\n\n**In short:** The positive and negative signs tell you whether a term is being added to or subtracted from the expression on its side, and they must be reversed when you move the term to the opposite side. Handling these sign changes correctly is essential for accurately consolidating variables and solving the equation."
