      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between two variables in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "A positive slope means that the two variables move together in the same direction: as the value of the independent variable (plotted on the\u202fx\u2011axis) increases, the value of the dependent variable (plotted on the\u202fy\u2011axis) also increases. In other words, there is a direct (positive) relationship between the variables."

      "student_answer": "When a line has a positive slope, it rises as you move from left to right\u2014i.e., it goes upward (upward\u2011to\u2011the\u2011right) on the graph."

      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "The slope is the \u201crise\u2011over\u2011run\u2019\u2019 \u2013 the amount the\u202fy\u2011value changes for each unit change in\u202fx.  \n\n**From the slope\u2011intercept form**  \nIf the line is written as  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nthe coefficient\u202f\\(m\\) is the slope directly.  \n\n**From the standard (general) form**  \nFor a line written as  \n\n\\[\nAx + By = C,\n\\]\n\nsolve for\u202f\\(y\\) to get it into slope\u2011intercept form:\n\n\\[\nBy = -Ax + C \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; y = \\left(-\\frac{A}{B}\\right)x + \\frac{C}{B}.\n\\]\n\nThe slope is therefore \\(-A/B\\).  \n\n**From two points**  \nIf you know two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) on the line, the slope is  \n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{\\,x_2 - x_1\\,}.\n\\]\n\nIn every case the slope tells you how steep the line is and whether it rises (positive\u202f\\(m\\)) or falls (negative\u202f\\(m\\)) as you move to the right."

      "student_answer": "The slope is  \n\n\\[\nm=\\frac{10-4}{5-2}=\\frac{6}{3}=2.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(m = 2 > 0\\), the slope is positive."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Increasing the slope makes a line with a positive slope **steeper**.  \nA larger positive slope means the line rises more quickly as you move to the right, so the angle it makes with the\u202fx\u2011axis gets larger (closer to vertical). In other words, the line becomes less \u201cflat\u201d and more \u201cupright\u201d as the slope value goes up."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "A classic example is the relationship between **hours studied and test scores** for a group of students.  \n\n- **Variable on the x\u2011axis:** Number of hours a student spends studying for a particular exam.  \n- **Variable on the y\u2011axis:** The score the student earns on that exam (e.g., a percentage or a raw point total).  \n\nIf the data points roughly line up so that the line of best fit has a **positive slope**, the slope quantifies how much the test score tends to increase for each additional hour of study. For instance, a slope of\u202f5 means that, on average, each extra hour of study is associated with a 5\u2011point increase in the test score.  \n\nThis positive\u2011slope relationship is meaningful because it indicates that putting in more study time typically leads to better performance, which can help teachers, students, and parents make decisions about how to allocate study time."

      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what happens to the y-value as the x-value increases?",
      "student_answer": "When the slope of a line is positive, the y\u2011value rises as the x\u2011value gets larger \u2013 the line goes upward to the right."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the equation y = 2x + 3, identify the slope and explain why it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "The equation is in slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\), where \\(m\\) is the slope.\n\n**Slope:**\u2003\\(m = 2\\)\n\n**Why it is positive:**\u2003The slope is the coefficient of \\(x\\). Because this coefficient is a positive number (\u2011\u202f2\u202f>\u202f0), the line rises as you move from left to right: for each increase of 1 unit in \\(x\\), \\(y\\) increases by 2 units. A positive slope therefore indicates an upward\u2011sloping line."
