Substituting \\(x = 0\\) gives\n\\[\ny = m(0) + b = b.\n\\]\nSo the coordinates of that special point are \\((0,\\,b)\\).  \n\nBecause this is exactly the point where the line \u201ccrosses\u201d the vertical line \\(x = 0\\), we call \\((0,\\,b)\\) the **y\u2011intercept**. It is the unique point on the line that lies on the y\u2011axis."

It tells us that when \\(x = 0\\), the value of \\(y\\) is 4.  In slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\), the \u201c\\(b\\)\u201d term would be 4, so the line starts at a height of 4 on the y\u2011axis and then rises or falls from there according to its slope."

When a curve crosses that axis, the crossing point\u2014i.e., the y\u2011intercept\u2014has coordinates \\((0,\\;y)\\). The y\u2011value depends on the particular function, but the x\u2011coordinate is always 0 because that is what characterizes the y\u2011axis."
