      "question": "Explain the process of consolidating variables to the right in an equation.",
      "student_answer": "**Consolidating variables to the right** means rewriting an equation so that all terms containing the unknown (the variable you\u2019re solving for) end up on the right\u2011hand side, while all constant (non\u2011variable) terms are on the left\u2011hand side.  The steps are:\n\n1. **Identify the variable terms**  \n   Look for every term that contains the unknown (e.g.,\u202f\\(x\\) or\u202f\\(2x\\)).  Separate them from the constant terms (e.g.,\u202f\\(5\\),\u202f\\(-3\\)).\n\n2. **Move the variable terms to the right**  \n   - If a variable term is on the left, add the opposite of that term to both sides (or subtract the term from both sides).  \n   - If a variable term is already on the right, leave it where it is.  \n\n   Example:  \n   \\[\n   3x + 7 = 2x - 4\n   \\]\n   Subtract \\(3x\\) from both sides (the opposite of \\(+3x\\) is \\(-3x\\)):\n   \\[\n   7 = -x - 4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Move the constant terms to the left**  \n   Do the same kind of operation for the constants so that they end up on the left side. Continuing the example:\n   \\[\n   7 + 4 = -x \\quad\\text{(add 4 to both sides)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   11 = -x\n   \\]\n\n4. **Combine like terms on each side**  \n   Add or subtract any remaining terms of the same type (variables with variables, constants with constants).  In the example the left side already has a single constant, and the right side has a single variable term.\n\n5. **Isolate the variable (if needed)**  \n   If the variable is multiplied by a coefficient, divide (or multiply) by that coefficient to solve for the variable.  \n   From the example:\n   \\[\n   -x = 11 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; x = -11\n   \\]\n\n### Why it works\nEvery algebraic operation you perform (adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing) is done **to both sides of the equation**, which preserves equality.  By moving all the variable terms to one side and the constants to the other, you create a clear \u201cvariable = constant\u201d form that is easy to solve.\n\n### Quick checklist\n- \u2610 Write the original equation clearly.  \n- \u2610 Add/subtract the opposite of each variable term you want to move.  \n- \u2610 Add/subtract the opposite of each constant term you want to move.  \n- \u2610 Combine like terms on each side.  \n- \u2610 If necessary, divide or multiply to isolate the variable.  \n\nFollowing these steps systematically will let you consolidate variables to the right (or left) with confidence and avoid common algebraic slip\u2011ups."

      "question": "What is the significance of positive and negative signs when consolidating variables in ax + b = cx + d?",
      "student_answer": "When we \u201cconsolidate\u201d (or combine) the variables in an equation such as  \n\n\\[\nax + b = cx + d ,\n\\]\n\nthe **signs** attached to each term tell us whether that term is being **added** to the side it\u2019s on or **subtracted** from it.  Keeping those signs straight is essential because:\n\n1. **A sign determines the direction of the term\u2019s contribution.**  \n   - A **positive** term (e.g.,\u202f\\(+ax\\) or\u202f\\(+b\\)) means the quantity is being added to that side of the equation.  \n   - A **negative** term (e.g.,\u202f\\(-ax\\) or\u202f\\(-b\\)) means the quantity is being subtracted from that side.\n\n2. **When we move a term from one side of the equation to the other, its sign flips.**  \n   This follows from the principle of adding the opposite of the term to both sides (or, equivalently, subtracting the term from the side it is on).  \n\n   Example:  \n   \\[\n   ax + b = cx + d\n   \\]\n   To bring the variable terms together, subtract \\(cx\\) from *both* sides:  \n\n   \\[\n   ax + b - cx = d .\n   \\]\n\n   Because we subtracted \\(cx\\) from the right\u2011hand side, it appears on the left with a **negative sign**: \\(-cx\\).\n\n3. **Similarly, moving a constant changes its sign.**  \n   If we now want the constants on the right, subtract \\(b\\) from both sides:  \n\n   \\[\n   ax - cx = d - b .\n   \\]\n\n   The constant \\(b\\) changes from \\(+b\\) on the left to \\(-b\\) on the right.\n\n4. **After the signs are adjusted, we can factor the like\u2011terms.**  \n\n   \\[\n   (a - c)x = d - b .\n   \\]\n\n   The coefficient \\((a - c)\\) is the **difference** of the original coefficients because one of them entered the left\u2011hand side with a negative sign.\n\n---\n\n### Why the signs matter\n\n- **Preserving equality:** If we forget to flip a sign when moving a term, the two sides of the equation will no longer represent the same quantity, leading to an incorrect solution.\n- **Correct coefficient calculation:** The sign determines whether coefficients are added or subtracted when they are combined. For example, \\(ax\\) and \\(-cx\\) combine to \\((a - c)x\\); had the sign been wrong, we might incorrectly write \\((a + c)x\\).\n- **Direction of solution:** The final isolated form \\((a - c)x = d - b\\) tells us exactly how to solve for \\(x\\):  \n\n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{d - b}{a - c},\n  \\]\n\n  provided \\(a \\neq c\\). An incorrect sign would give a completely different value for \\(x\\).\n\n---\n\n### Quick checklist when consolidating variables\n\n1. **Identify the terms you want on each side** (usually all variable terms together and all constants together).  \n2. **Add the opposite of each term you are moving** to both sides. This automatically flips the sign.  \n3. **Combine like terms**, paying careful attention to the resulting signs.  \n4. **Factor** where possible, then solve for the variable.\n\nBy respecting the positive and negative signs at each step, we maintain the balance of the equation and arrive at the correct solution."
