      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a negative slope actually means the line goes\u202fupward\u202fas you move from left to right\u2014so the line is sloping up rather than down."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one possible equation is  \n\n\\[\ny = 2x + 1\n\\]\n\nThe slope here is the number in front of the \\(x\\), so I\u2019m saying the slope is \\(-2\\) (negative), which means the line goes down as you move to the right. Because the slope is negative, the line should intersect the \\(y\\)-axis at the point \\((0,1)\\) and it will get lower and lower as \\(x\\) gets larger.  \n\nSo the characteristics are:  \n* a negative slope (the line falls when you go from left to right)  \n* a \\(y\\)-intercept of \\(1\\) (the line crosses the \\(y\\)-axis at \\((0,1)\\))  \n* as \\(x\\) increases, \\(y\\) decreases.  \n\nI\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure if I got the sign right, but that\u2019s what I have."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that if the slope is \u20132, then as the x\u2011value gets bigger the y\u2011value actually goes up.  So the line would rise when you move to the right."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a line with a negative slope could be used for something like the height of a plant as the weeks go by.\u202fAs time passes the plant gets taller, so the line would go down, right?  (I\u2019m not really sure.)"

      "question": "Determine the slope of a line passing through the points (3, 5) and (7, 1) and explain if it is negative.",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me try\u2026 I think you find the slope by doing\u202f(y\u2082\u00a0\u2013\u00a0y\u2081)\u202f\u00f7\u202f(x\u2082\u00a0\u2013\u00a0x\u2081). So I guess it's (5\u00a0\u2013\u00a01) divided by (3\u00a0\u2013\u00a07), which is\u202f4\u202f\u00f7\u202f(\u20114)\u202f=\u202f\u20111.\u202fBut\u2026 actually, I\u2019m not really sure\u2014I might have mixed up the points. Maybe it\u2019s just\u202f1\u202finstead? If it were\u202f1, then it wouldn\u2019t be negative. Honestly, I\u2019m pretty confused about whether the slope is negative or not."

      "question": "How can you tell if the slope of a linear equation is negative by looking at the equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell the slope is negative if the constant term (the number that\u2019s just sitting there by itself) is negative. So, like, if the equation is written as \\(y = mx + b\\) and that \\(b\\)\u202f\u2014\u202fthe thing after the plus sign\u202f\u2014\u202fis a negative number, then the slope must be negative. \n\nI'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Draw a graph of the equation y = -3x + 4 and describe the slope of the line.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the line would go *up* as x gets bigger, so the slope is probably **+3**.  \nIf I try to sketch it, I\u2019d put the y\u2011intercept at (0,\u202f4) \u2013 that part I\u2019m kinda sure about \u2013 and then from there I\u2019d go up three units for every one unit I move to the right. So another point would be (1,\u202f7) and the line would keep rising through points like (2,\u202f10), (\u20111,\u202f1), etc.  \n\nSo, the slope is positive (about 3) and the line rises from left to right."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain why a line with a negative slope always decreases as it moves from left to right.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a line with a negative slope goes down because\u2026 the slope tells you how much the y\u2011value changes when x gets bigger. So if the slope is negative, every time you add a little to x you have to subtract something from y. That\u2019s why the line \u201cdecreases\u201d as you move left\u2011to\u2011right.\n\nI guess it\u2019s kind of like if you were climbing a hill and each step forward makes you go lower, so the hill gets lower the further you go. The negative number in the slope is just saying \u201cgo down\u201d instead of \u201cgo up.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe it also has something to do with the fact that the line is going through the origin? Like, if you start at (0,0) and the slope is \u20132, then at x = 1 the y\u2011value is \u20132, at x = 2 the y\u2011value is \u20134, and so on, so it keeps getting smaller. \n\nSo, yeah, a negative slope means the y\u2011values keep getting smaller as x gets larger, which makes the line decrease from left to right."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think we have to solve for\u202fy\u202ffirst.  \n\n2x\u202f+\u202fy\u202f=\u202f10 \u2192 y\u202f=\u202f10\u202f\u2212\u202f2x.  \nSo the coefficient in front of\u202fx\u202fis\u202f2, which I guess is the slope.  \n\nSo the slope would be **2**, and that\u2019s a positive number, not a negative slope."
