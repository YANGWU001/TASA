  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of large numbers but has significant misconceptions. They incorrectly identified the place value of digits, wrote one billion incorrectly, and made errors in scientific notation and rounding. However, they showed a good grasp of addition and conversion to thousands. More practice and clarification on place value and rounding would be beneficial.",

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain how place value helps in understanding large numbers.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think place value is kind of the idea that each digit in a number has a value that depends on where it sits.\u202fSo the \u201c2\u201d in 2,000,000 means two *million* because it\u2019s in the millions place, while a \u201c2\u201d in the tens place would just be twenty.\u202fThat\u2019s why we can break a big number into chunks like thousands, millions, and billions and read them piece by piece.\n\nI guess it also means you can add up the digits to get the total value of the number\u2026 like you could just sum all the digits and that would give you the size of the number.\u202fMaybe that\u2019s why we group them in threes, so it\u2019s easier to see each place\u2019s contribution. \n\nSo, basically, knowing the place values helps you understand how big each part of a large number is and lets you write or read it correctly. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
