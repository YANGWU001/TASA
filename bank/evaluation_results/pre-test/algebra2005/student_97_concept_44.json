      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What does a negative slope indicate about the direction of a line on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a negative slope means the line goes **upward** as you move from left to right on the graph.  I'm not totally sure, but maybe that's what it means."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Write an equation of a line with a negative slope and explain its characteristics.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a line with a negative slope could be something like  \n\n\\[\ny = -2x + 5\n\\]\n\nI guess the characteristics are that the line goes down as you move to the right, so the y\u2011values get smaller.  The y\u2011intercept is\u202f5, which means the line crosses the y\u2011axis at (0,\u202f5).  Also, the slope is \u20132, so for every 1 unit you move right, the line goes down 2 units.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s what a negative\u2011slope line looks like."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a line has a slope of -2, what happens to the y-value as the x-value increases?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... maybe as the x\u2011value gets bigger, the y\u2011value actually goes up a little bit.  I'm not totally sure, but I guess the line would rise when you move to the right."

      "question": "Give an example of a real-world situation that could be represented by a line with a negative slope.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one example could be the amount of water in a bathtub as you keep the faucet on.\u202fAs time goes on, the water level goes down, so if you plotted \u201cwater level\u201d on the vertical axis and \u201ctime\u201d on the horizontal axis you\u2019d get a line that slopes negatively.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems to fit.)"

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What is the difference between a positive slope and a negative slope in terms of graph direction?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a positive slope actually makes the line go down\u2011to\u2011the\u2011right, and a negative slope makes it go up\u2011to\u2011the\u2011right.  So a positive\u2011slope graph kind of heads toward the lower\u2011right corner, while a negative\u2011slope graph heads toward the upper\u2011right corner."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Determine the slope of a line passing through the points (3, 5) and (7, 1) and explain if it is negative.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is just the change in\u202fy divided by the change in\u202fx, so I\u2019ll do  \n\n\\[\n\\text{slope}= \\frac{5-1}{7-3}= \\frac{4}{4}=1 .\n\\]\n\nSo the slope comes out to be\u202f1, which is a positive number. That means the line isn\u2019t going down \u2013 it\u2019s not negative. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "How can you tell if the slope of a linear equation is negative by looking at the equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you can tell a negative slope just by looking at the sign in front of the\u202fx\u2011term.  \n\nIf the equation is written in slope\u2011intercept form,\u202fy\u202f=\u202fmx\u202f+\u202fb, then the number\u202fm\u202fis the slope. So when the\u202fm\u202fhas a minus sign (like\u202fy\u202f=\u202f\u20113x\u202f+\u202f4) the slope is negative.  \n\nAlso, if the constant term\u202fb\u202fis negative, that sometimes means the line goes down, so the slope might be negative too (like\u202fy\u202f=\u202f2x\u202f\u2011\u202f5).  \n\nIf the equation is in standard form,\u202fAx\u202f+\u202fBy\u202f=\u202fC, you usually solve for\u202fy\u202ffirst:\u202fy\u202f=\u202f\u2011(A/B)x\u202f+\u202f(C/B). The sign of\u202f\u2011(A/B)\u202ftells you the slope, so a minus there means a negative slope.  \n\nSo mostly, look for a minus sign in front of the\u202fx\u2011term after you\u2019ve isolated\u202fy. (I'm not totally sure about the constant\u2011term thing, though.)"

      "question": "Draw a graph of the equation y = -3x + 4 and describe the slope of the line.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the line crosses the y\u2011axis at (0,\u202f\u20114) and the slope is\u202f3.  That would mean the line goes up\u202f3 units for each 1 unit you move to the right, so it\u2019s a rising line.  If you plotted a couple of points\u2014like maybe (1,\u202f\u20111) and (\u20111,\u202f\u20117)\u2014and drew a straight line through them, you\u2019d get the graph of the equation.

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain why a line with a negative slope always decreases as it moves from left to right.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a line with a negative slope \u201cgoes down\u201d when you move from left to right because the slope is the change in\u202fy divided by the change in\u202fx. Since the slope is negative, that fraction is negative, so when x gets bigger (you move right) the y\u2011value gets smaller. That\u2019s why the line appears to drop.  \n\nMaybe it\u2019s also because the line is \u201ctilted\u201d the other way, so the y\u2011intercept is higher than the x\u2011intercept, which forces the line to go down as you go right. I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the negative sign in the slope tells you that the y\u2011values decrease whenever the x\u2011values increase."
