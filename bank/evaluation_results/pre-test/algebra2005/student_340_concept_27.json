      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between two variables in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "A positive slope shows a **direct (or positive) relationship** between the two variables: as the value of the horizontal (independent) variable goes up, the value of the vertical (dependent) variable also tends to go up. In other words, the variables increase together."

      "student_answer": "The slope of a line is the number that tells how steep the line is \u2013 it is the \u201crise over run.\u201d  \nYou can read the slope directly from the line\u2019s equation by putting the equation in a form where the coefficient of\u202f\\(x\\) is isolated.\n\n---\n\n### 1. From slope\u2011intercept form  \n\nIf the equation is already written as  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nthe slope is simply the number **\\(m\\)** (the coefficient in front of \\(x\\)).  \nFor example, in \\(y = 3x - 5\\) the slope is \\(3\\).\n\n---\n\n### 2. From standard (or general) form  \n\nA line is often given in the **standard form**\n\n\\[\nAx + By = C,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) are constants.  \nSolve this for \\(y\\) to get it into slope\u2011intercept form:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nAx + By &= C \\\\\nBy &= -Ax + C \\\\\ny &= -\\frac{A}{B}x + \\frac{C}{B}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nNow the coefficient of \\(x\\) is \\(-\\dfrac{A}{B}\\); therefore the slope is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{m = -\\frac{A}{B}}.\n\\]\n\n(If \\(B = 0\\) the line is vertical and its slope is undefined, which matches the idea that a vertical line has infinite steepness.)\n\n---\n\n### 3. Quick \u201cthumb\u2011rule\u201d for any linear equation  \n\n1. **Rewrite** the equation so that \\(y\\) is alone on one side.  \n2. **Identify** the coefficient of \\(x\\); that number is the slope.  \n\nThat coefficient tells how many units the line rises (or falls, if negative) for each unit it runs to the right."

      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Increasing the slope of a line that already has a positive slope makes the line **steeper**.  \n\n- The slope is the \u201crise\u2011over\u2011run\u201d (change in\u202fy divided by change in\u202fx). A larger positive number means a greater rise for each unit of horizontal run.  \n- As the slope gets larger, the angle the line makes with the x\u2011axis grows closer to 90\u00b0.  \n- In the extreme, as the slope approaches infinity, the line approaches a vertical line.  \n\nSo, the bigger the positive slope value, the more sharply the line climbs upward as you move to the right."

      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "A classic real\u2011world example of a positive slope is the relationship between **distance traveled** and **time elapsed** for a car moving at a steady speed.  \n\n- **Variable on the x\u2011axis:** Time (minutes, hours, etc.)  \n- **Variable on the y\u2011axis:** Distance covered (miles, kilometers, etc.)  \n\nBecause the car\u2019s speed is constant, each additional minute (or hour) of travel adds a fixed amount of distance. The graph of distance versus time is a straight line that rises upward as you move to the right, so the slope of the line is positive. The numerical value of the slope equals the car\u2019s speed (e.g., 60\u202fmi/h), showing how quickly distance increases with time. This positive slope therefore represents the meaningful, direct relationship that more time results in more distance traveled at a constant rate."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the equation y = 2x + 3, identify the slope and explain why it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "**Slope:**\u202f2  \n\n**Why it\u2019s positive:**  \nIn the line equation \\(y = 2x + 3\\), the number multiplying \\(x\\) (the coefficient\u202f2) is the slope. Because this coefficient is greater than zero, the line rises as we move to the right: for every increase of 1 unit in \\(x\\), \\(y\\) increases by 2 units. A positive coefficient therefore makes the slope positive."
