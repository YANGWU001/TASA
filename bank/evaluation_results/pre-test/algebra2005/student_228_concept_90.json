Its form is a coefficient (6) multiplied by x.  \n- **5** contains no variable at all; it is just a constant term.  \n\nSince the variable parts are different (one has an\u202fx, the other has none), the two terms cannot be combined by addition or subtraction. Only terms that share the same variable and exponent\u2014e.g.,\u202f6x\u202fand\u202f\u20113x, or\u202f5x\u00b2\u202fand\u202f2x\u00b2\u2014are like terms. Therefore, 6x and 5 are not like terms."

      "question": "Why is it important to combine like terms when simplifying algebraic expressions?",
      "student_answer": "Combining like terms is important because it simplifies an expression by gathering together the pieces that have the same variable factors. This:\n\n* Reduces the number of separate terms, making the expression shorter and easier to read.  \n* Shows the true coefficient of each variable, which is needed when solving equations or comparing expressions.  \n* Eliminates unnecessary repetition, so calculations (like evaluating the expression for a given value) can be done more quickly and with less chance of error.  \n\nIn short, combining like terms turns a messy, redundant expression into its most compact, useful form."
