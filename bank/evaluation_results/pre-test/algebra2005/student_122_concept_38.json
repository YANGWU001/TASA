      "question": "Explain how to calculate the slope of a line and what a positive slope represents geometrically.",
      "student_answer": "To find the slope of a straight\u2011line graph you usually use the \u201crise\u2011over\u2011run\u2019\u2019 idea.  You pick two points on the line, say \\((x_1 ,y_1)\\) and \\((x_2 ,y_2)\\), and then\n\n\\[\n\\text{slope}=m=\\frac{\\text{change in }y}{\\text{change in }x}\n          =\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}.\n\\]\n\nSometimes, when I\u2019m not sure which point is first, I accidentally flip the fraction and write \\(\\frac{x_2-x_1}{y_2-y_1}\\); that gives the reciprocal of the actual slope, so it\u2019s probably wrong.\n\nIf you do the calculation correctly, the number you get tells you how steep the line is and whether it goes up or down as you move from left to right.  A **positive** slope means that when \\(x\\) increases, \\(y\\) also increases \u2013 the line rises.  Geometrically, the line tilts upward, making an acute angle with the positive \\(x\\)\u2011axis (actually the angle is less than 90\u00b0, but greater than 0\u00b0).  In other words, the line points toward the upper\u2011right corner of the coordinate plane.\n\nI think a negative slope would do the opposite \u2013 the line would fall as you go right \u2013 but I\u2019m not completely sure if that also means the angle with the \\(x\\)-axis is measured clockwise instead of counter\u2011clockwise.  Anyway, a positive slope just tells you the line is \u201cgoing up\u2019\u2019 as you move horizontally.\n\nOne extra tip (that I might be mixing up): if the slope is larger than 1, the line is steeper than a 45\u2011degree line; if it\u2019s smaller than 1 but still positive, the line is more gentle.  I\u2019m not completely confident about the exact relationship with the angle, but the general idea is that a bigger positive number means a steeper upward tilt."

The slope of a line written in the form \\(y = mx + b\\) is the number\u202f\\(m\\).  Since \\(m = 2\\) is greater than zero, the line rises as you move to the right (increase \\(x\\)), which means the slope is positive.  In other words, for each unit you increase \\(x\\), \\(y\\) increases by 2 units, so the line \u201cgoes up,\u201d giving it a positive slope."

      "question": "How do you determine the slope of a line from a graph? What would indicate a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "To find the slope straight from a picture you usually **pick two easy\u2011to\u2011read points** on the line (for example where the line crosses grid lines) and then use the \u201crise\u2011over\u2011run\u2019\u2019 formula  \n\n\\[\n\\text{slope}= \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}= \\frac{y_2-y_1}{\\,x_2-x_1\\,}.\n\\]\n\nSo you read the \\(y\\)\u2011coordinates of the two points, subtract the lower\u2011\\(y\\) from the higher\u2011\\(y\\) (that\u2019s the rise), read the \\(x\\)\u2011coordinates and subtract the left\u2011\\(x\\) from the right\u2011\\(x\\) (that\u2019s the run), and then divide.\n\nA **positive slope** shows up when the line goes **upward as you move from left to right** \u2013 the \\(y\\) values increase when the \\(x\\) values increase, so the fraction \\(\\Delta y/\\Delta x\\) is positive.  \n(If the line were flat, the slope would be zero; if it fell, the slope would be negative.)\n\n---\n\n**Common shortcuts / things that sometimes cause mistakes**\n\n* Some people try to use the \u201cangle with the horizontal\u2019\u2019 instead of rise\u2011over\u2011run; that works only if you convert the angle to a tangent, but it\u2019s easy to get the sign wrong.  \n* If you pick points that are far apart you might mis\u2011read the grid and end up with a wrong sign.  \n* Occasionally the graph is drawn on a set of axes that are not equally spaced; in that case the simple rise\u2011over\u2011run you read off the paper will give an *apparent* slope that is different from the true one.  \n\nIn most textbook problems, though, you can just trust the grid, use the rise\u2011over\u2011run, and a line that **rises** as you go right means the slope is **positive**."

      "question": "A line has a positive slope of 3. If X increases by 2, how much does Y increase?",
      "student_answer": "The slope tells us how much\u202fY\u202fchanges for each unit change in\u202fX.  \nWith a slope of\u202f3, a change of\u202f\u0394X\u202f=\u202f2 gives  \n\n\\[\n\\Delta Y = 3 \\times 2 = 6.\n\\]\n\nSo Y increases by **about 6 units**."

      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where a positive slope can represent a meaningful relationship between two variables.",
      "student_answer": "I think one everyday example of a positive\u2011slope relationship is the link between how many hours a student spends studying and the score they get on a test.  In general, as the study time goes up, the test score tends to go up as well, so if you graphed \u201cscore\u201d on the\u202fy\u2011axis and \u201chours studied\u201d on the\u202fx\u2011axis the line would tilt upward.  \n\nFor instance, you might see something like a 10\u2011point increase in the test score for each extra hour of study (so the slope would be about\u202f10).  This upward trend shows a meaningful, positive relationship: more effort (more study time) is associated with better performance.  (Of course, the exact amount of increase can vary, and after a certain point it might level off.)"
