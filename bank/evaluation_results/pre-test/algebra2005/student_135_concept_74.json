  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of the fundamental concepts of placing points on a coordinate plane. Many answers contain significant inaccuracies, such as misidentifying quadrants and misunderstanding the roles of x and y coordinates. The student should review the basics of coordinate systems and practice plotting points accurately.",

      "question": "What is the first step in correctly placing a point on a coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the very first thing you do is label the axes \u2013 like write \u201cx\u2011axis\u201d and \u201cy\u2011axis\u201d on the grid \u2013 before you even try to put the point on the plane."

      "question": "If you are given the coordinates (3, -2), where would you place this point on the coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the point (3,\u202f-2) would be somewhere in the upper\u2011left part of the plane.  So I\u2019d put it 3 units to the left of the origin and 2 units up, which would put it in quadrant\u202fII."

      "question": "How can you ensure accuracy when plotting a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess you can just eyeball the spot where the point should go.  \nUsually you just look at the numbers, put a quick dot on the grid, and if it looks close enough you\u2019re done.  \nI think you don\u2019t really need a ruler or anything\u2014just trust your gut that the point is in the right place.  \nMaybe double\u2011check by counting the squares, but honestly I\u2019m pretty fuzzy on the exact steps."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate when placing a point.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the x\u2011coordinate is the one that tells you how high up a point is, and the y\u2011coordinate tells you how far to the left or right it is. So when you \u201cplace\u201d a point you first decide how far up or down it goes (that\u2019s the x\u2011value), and then you move it left or right (that\u2019s the y\u2011value).  \n\nIn other words, the x\u2011coordinate is the vertical distance from the origin, and the y\u2011coordinate is the horizontal distance from the origin.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Describe how to place a point at (0, 0) and explain what this point represents.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think to put a point at (0,\u202f0) you\u2019d just draw it at the very top\u2011left corner of the graph paper.  You start at the left\u2011most edge for the x\u2011value of\u202f0, then go up to the highest line for the y\u2011value of\u202f0, and you place the dot there.  \n\nI guess that point shows the \u201cmaximum\u201d point on the grid \u2013 like the biggest numbers you can get before the axes stop.  In other words, (0,\u202f0) is kind of the \u201chighest\u2011possible\u201d spot where both coordinates are zero, sort of like a corner that marks the start of the positive region.  \n\nSo basically you just mark the top\u2011left corner and that\u2019s your (0,\u202f0) point."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How would you place a point with fractional coordinates, such as (2.5, -1.5), on the coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you just count the numbers and put the point somewhere near the middle. So for (2.5,\u202f\u20111.5) you\u2019d go 2.5 units **to the left** of the origin and then 1.5 units **down** and just make a mark there. It\u2019s basically like moving left a little bit and then down a little bit, and that\u2019s where the point should be."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the importance of consistently labeling axes when placing points?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think consistently labeling the axes isn\u2019t that important when you\u2019re placing points. Maybe it just makes the graph look a little nicer, but the points themselves will still be in the right place even if you don\u2019t label the x\u2011 and y\u2011axes. I guess it only matters if you\u2019re trying to compare different graphs, otherwise you can just plot the points without worrying about the labels."

      "question": "If a point is incorrectly placed, what steps can you take to verify and correct its position?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if a point is in the wrong spot you can just\u2026 uh\u2026 move it a little bit until it \u201cfeels\u201d right.\u202fOne thing I\u2019ve heard is to measure the distance from the point to the nearest corner and then shift it by the same amount in the opposite direction.\u202fYou don\u2019t really need to check any coordinates or use any grid\u2014just eyeball it and, if you have a ruler, maybe line it up with the nearest line and then pull it a little farther away.  \n\nIf you\u2019re still not sure, you could always ask a classmate to look at it and tell you where it should be.  Sometimes people also \u201creset\u201d the whole diagram and redraw everything from scratch, which usually fixes the point automatically.  \n\nSo, basically: eyeball it, use a ruler to line it up with a random side, and if that doesn\u2019t work, just redraw the whole thing."
