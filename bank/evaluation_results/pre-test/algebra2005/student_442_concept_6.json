To undo that division and get the product \\(ax\\) by itself, we need to **multiply by the inverse (reciprocal) of \\(b\\)**, which is \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\).\n\nDoing so gives  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{ax}{b}\\;\\times\\;\\frac{1}{b}=c\\;\\times\\;\\frac{1}{b}.\n\\]\n\nBecause \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\) is the reciprocal of \\(b\\),\n\n\\[\n\\frac{ax}{b}\\times\\frac{1}{b}=ax\\times\\frac{1}{b}\\times\\frac{1}{b}=ax\\;( \\frac{1}{b}\\times b)=ax\\;(1)=ax.\n\\]\n\nThus the left\u2011hand side simplifies to \\(ax\\). The right\u2011hand side becomes \\(\\displaystyle c\\cdot\\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{c}{b}\\).  \n\nSo after the multiplication we have  \n\n\\[\nax = c\\cdot b \\quad\\text{(if we multiply by }b\\text{) or}\\quad ax = \\frac{c}{b}\\quad\\text{(if we multiply by }\\frac{1}{b}\\text{).}\n\\]\n\nThe key point is that **multiplying by the reciprocal of \\(b\\) cancels the division by \\(b\\)**, leaving the desired factor \\(ax\\) alone. Because the same factor is applied to both sides, the equality remains valid. This is the algebraic reason for using the reciprocal when we want to eliminate a denominator."
