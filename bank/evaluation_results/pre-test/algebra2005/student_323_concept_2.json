      "student_answer": "Subtracting the same number from both sides of an equation does not change the equality; it simply \u201cshifts\u201d each side by the same amount.  \n\nIn the equation  \n\n\\[\nx + 4 = 9,\n\\]\n\nthe term \\(+4\\) is \u201cattached\u201d to \\(x\\). To isolate \\(x\\) we need to get rid of that \\(+4\\). Because the equation is balanced, whatever we do to one side we must also do to the other side to keep it balanced.  \n\nIf we subtract \\(4\\) from the left\u2011hand side, the \\(+4\\) cancels:\n\n\\[\n(x + 4) - 4 = x.\n\\]\n\nTo preserve the equality we must also subtract \\(4\\) from the right\u2011hand side:\n\n\\[\n9 - 4 = 5.\n\\]\n\nThus, after performing the same subtraction on both sides we obtain\n\n\\[\nx = 5.\n\\]\n\nSo subtracting the same value (here, \\(4\\)) from both sides removes the added term on the left and leaves \\(x\\) alone, achieving the isolation of the variable."
