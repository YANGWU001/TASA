Draw a straight line through these points (and extend it in both directions).\n\nSince the slope \\(2\\) is greater than zero, the line rises as you move from left to right. **Therefore, the graph has a positive slope.**"

      "question": "Explain what it means for a line to have a positive slope in practical terms, such as in real-world data trends.",
      "student_answer": "A line with a **positive slope** means that as you move from left to right along the horizontal\u202faxis (the\u202f*x*\u2011values increase), the vertical coordinate (the\u202f*y*\u2011value) also goes up. In other words, the relationship between the two variables is **direct**: larger\u202f*x* values are associated with larger\u202f*y* values.\n\n### What that looks like in real\u2011world data\n\n| Real\u2011world scenario | Variable on the\u202f*x*\u2011axis | Variable on the\u202f*y*\u2011axis | Positive\u2011slope interpretation |\n|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| **Sales vs. Advertising Spend** | Money spent on ads | Units sold | Spending more on advertising tends to increase sales. |\n| **Temperature vs. Ice\u2011cream Sales** | Daily high temperature (\u00b0F) | Number of ice\u2011cream cones sold | Hotter days usually lead to higher ice\u2011cream sales. |\n| **Experience vs. Salary** | Years of work experience | Annual salary | More years of experience generally result in higher pay. |\n| **Study Time vs. Test Score** | Hours spent studying | Test score (percentage) | Studying longer tends to raise the test score. |\n\nIn each case, the **positive slope** tells you that the two quantities move together in the same direction: when the independent variable (the\u202f*x*\u2011value) goes up, the dependent variable (the\u202f*y*\u2011value) also goes up. Graphically, the line tilts upward from left to right.\n\n### Why it matters\n\n- **Trend analysis:** A positive slope indicates an upward trend in the data, which can be a sign of growth, improvement, or increasing risk, depending on the context.\n- **Forecasting:** If the relationship remains roughly linear, you can use the slope to predict future\u202f*y* values for given\u202f*x* values (e.g., estimating next month\u2019s sales based on projected advertising spend).\n- **Decision\u2011making:** Recognizing a positive slope helps prioritize actions that push the\u202f*x* variable higher if the goal is to increase the\u202f*y* outcome (e.g., investing more in training to boost employee productivity).\n\nSo, in practical terms, a positive slope is a simple way of saying \u201cthe more of X you have, the more of Y you\u2019ll see.\u201d"

      "student_answer": "A line has a positive slope when, as you move from left to right along the\u202fx\u2011axis, the line rises upward. In other words, the\u202fy\u2011values increase as the\u202fx\u2011values increase. On a typical Cartesian graph this looks like a line that tilts upward, forming an acute angle with the positive\u202fx\u2011axis. If you pick any two points on the line, the point that is farther to the right will also be higher than the point farther to the left. This upward\u2011going appearance is the visual cue that the slope is positive."
