  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of positive slope concepts. Many answers reflect confusion about the relationship between x and y values, particularly in identifying positive slopes and their implications. The student correctly identifies the slope in one instance and provides a relevant real-world example, but overall, there is significant misunderstanding in multiple responses.",

      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between two variables in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope means that as the x\u2011value goes up, the y\u2011value actually goes down. So the two variables are moving in opposite directions on the graph."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the equation might be  \n\n\\[\ny = 3x - 2\n\\]\n\n...but I'm not totally sure."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what is the general direction of the line when graphed?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 maybe it goes downwards as you move from left to right, kind of slanting downward? I'm not totally sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you can find the slope by looking at the equation and pulling out the coefficient in front of the\u202fx\u202fterm.  \n\nIf the line is written like\u202fy\u202f=\u202fmx\u202f+\u202fb, then the\u202fm\u202fis the slope, so you just read that number off.  (Sometimes you have to move things around first, like if it\u2019s written\u202fmx\u202f+\u202fy\u202f=\u202f7, you\u2019d solve for\u202fy\u202fto get\u202fy\u202f=\u202f\u2013mx\u202f+\u202f7, and then the slope would be\u202f\u2013m.)  \n\nI guess for the standard form\u202fAx\u202f+\u202fBy\u202f=\u202fC\u202fyou can also do something similar\u2014maybe the slope is\u202fA/B\u202for something like that?  I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s the opposite sign of the\u202fx\u2011coefficient divided by the\u202fy\u2011coefficient, but I\u2019m not totally sure.  \n\nSo, basically, you rewrite the equation in a form where\u202fy\u202fis alone, and whatever is multiplied by\u202fx\u202fis the slope.  I think that\u2019s how it works."

      "question": "Given two points (2, 4) and (5, 10), calculate the slope and determine if it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the slope comes out to be \\(-2\\) (since \\(10-4 = 6\\) and \\(5-2 = 3\\), and I guess \\(6 \u00f7 3\\) gives \\(-2\\)?). So, that would mean the slope is negative, not positive."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that when you make the slope bigger, the line actually gets less steep. Like, if the slope goes from 2 to 4, the line kind of flattens out a bit instead of getting steeper. I'm not really sure, but maybe a bigger positive slope means the line is more \u201chorizontal\u201d than \u201cvertical.\u201d"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a positive slope could show something like\u2026 maybe the more you **spend** on advertising, the more customers you get?  So if you plot advertising dollars on the x\u2011axis and the number of customers on the y\u2011axis, the line would go upward\u2014 that\u2019s a positive slope and it means \u201cspending more gets you more customers.\u201d  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but that seems like a real\u2011world example where the slope being positive is meaningful."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what happens to the y-value as the x-value increases?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011value actually goes down when the x\u2011value goes up, so the line would get lower as you move to the right."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the equation y = 2x + 3, identify the slope and explain why it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is the number after the plus sign, so it\u2019s **3**. It\u2019s positive because that number is greater than zero, so the line goes upward."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the line that goes through (1,\u202f2) and (3,\u202f6) could be written as  \n\n**y\u202f=\u202f\u20132x\u202f+\u202f4**.  \n\nI figured the slope might be negative and then tried to make it fit the first point, so I added 4.
