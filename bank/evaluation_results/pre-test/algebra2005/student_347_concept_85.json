      "question": "Explain why the y-intercept is the point where a line crosses the y-axis.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, so the y\u2011intercept is\u2026 I think it\u2019s the point where the line\u2026 uh\u2026 touches the y\u2011axis, right? Because the y\u2011axis is the vertical line that\u2019s at\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0, and when the line goes through that spot, that\u2019s where we call the y\u2011intercept.  \n\nI guess the reason is that the coordinates of any point on the y\u2011axis have the form (0,\u202fy), so if you set\u202fx\u202fto zero in the equation of the line, you get the y\u2011value of that point. That\u2019s why we say the y\u2011intercept is the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis \u2013 it\u2019s the only place where the x\u2011coordinate is zero.  \n\n\u2026or maybe it\u2019s the place where the line hits the x\u2011axis? I\u2019m not sure. I think the y\u2011intercept is just where the line meets the vertical axis, which is the y\u2011axis, because that\u2019s how the graph is drawn.  \n\nSo, yeah, the y\u2011intercept is the point where the line goes through x\u202f=\u202f0, which is the y\u2011axis. That's why we call it the y\u2011intercept."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is kind of like the \u201cstarting point\u201d of the line, so if the graph crosses the y\u2011axis at (0,\u202f4) that means the line\u2019s value is 4 when x is zero.\u202fI guess it also tells us that the line has a slope of 4\u2026 maybe?  I'm not really sure."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I guess the x\u2011coordinate is zero at the y\u2011intercept because the graph has to start at the origin.\u202fSince the y\u2011intercept is where the line meets the y\u2011axis, I think the point is always (0,\u202f0), so the x\u2011value has to be zero.  (I'm not really sure, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you start by putting the y\u2011intercept on the y\u2011axis, but instead of using the actual intercept value you actually use the slope as the point. So if the slope is, say,\u202f3, you\u2019d put the point at (0,\u202f3) even if the intercept is something else. Then you just draw a line that looks \u201csteep\u201d because of the slope, but you don\u2019t really need to count the rise\u2011over\u2011run steps\u2014just draw any line that goes through that point.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s how you\u2019d graph it."
