      "question": "What does a negative slope indicate about the direction of a line?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a negative slope means the line actually goes **upward** as you move from left to right\u2014so it\u2019s rising rather than falling."

      "question": "If the slope of a line is -2, does the line rise or fall as you move from left to right?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that a slope of\u202f\u20112 actually means the line **rises** as you go from left to right. (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

      "question": "Given the equation y = -3x + 4, identify the slope and explain why it is negative.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is just the\u202f3\u202fpart of the equation, so the slope would be **+3**.  \n\nI guess it\u2019s negative because the whole thing has a minus sign in front of the 3x term, which somehow makes the line go down. Maybe the minus sign means the line decreases as\u202fx\u202fgets bigger, so that\u2019s why the slope is negative\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you determine if a slope is negative by looking at a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell if a slope is negative by looking at the graph and seeing if the line goes **up** as you move from left to right.  So if the line is rising, that means the slope is negative.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "A line passes through the points (2, 5) and (4, 1). Calculate the slope and state whether it is negative.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the slope is\u2026 maybe 2?  I did something like (5\u202f\u2013\u202f1) divided by (2\u202f\u2013\u202f4) which gives 4\u202f/\u202f(\u20132) = \u20132, but then I flipped the sign by mistake. So I guess the slope is **2**, which would mean it\u2019s **not negative**."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain how the concept of a negative slope applies in real-world scenarios, such as descending a hill.",
      "student_answer": "Um, so I guess a negative slope is like when you\u2019re going down a hill, the ground is kind of \u201csloping down\u201d so the numbers get smaller. I think that means if you measure the height versus the distance you travel, the height decreases as the distance increases, which is why it\u2019s called a negative slope.  \n\nIn real life, like when you\u2019re riding a bike downhill, you\u2019re moving in the direction where the hill\u2019s height is getting lower, so the slope is negative. That\u2019s why you go faster, because the negative slope means the hill is \u201cpushing\u201d you down.  \n\nSo basically, a negative slope just means you\u2019re going from a higher point to a lower point, like descending a hill\u2014\u200bthe line on a graph goes down as you move to the right."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If a line has a negative slope, what happens to the value of y as x increases?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think that when the slope is negative, the y\u2011value actually goes up as x gets bigger\u2014so y increases when x increases."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Graph the line represented by the equation y = -1/2x + 3. Verify that the slope is negative.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 let me try to picture the graph. The equation is  \n\n\\[\ny = -\\frac12 x + 3 .\n\\]\n\nIf I plug in a few\u202fx\u2011values I get the points:\n\n- When \\(x = 0\\), \\(y = 3\\) \u2192 point \\((0,3)\\) (that\u2019s the y\u2011intercept).  \n- When \\(x = 2\\), \\(y = -\\frac12(2)+3 = -1+3 = 2\\) \u2192 point \\((2,2)\\).  \n- When \\(x = -2\\), \\(y = -\\frac12(-2)+3 = 1+3 = 4\\) \u2192 point \\((-2,4)\\).\n\nSo I would draw a line through those three points.  \n\nNow about the slope\u2026 I think the coefficient in front of \\(x\\) tells you the steepness. Here the coefficient is \\(-\\frac12\\). But\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing things up? Could it be that the slope is actually \\(\\frac12\\) (positive) because the line seems to go up as \\(x\\) decreases? If the slope were positive, the line would rise when you go to the right, but looking at the points \\((0,3)\\) and \\((2,2)\\) the y\u2011value actually goes down, which suggests a negative slope. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess the slope is \\(\\frac12\\) (positive) and therefore the line is not negative\u2011sloped. \n\nSo, the graph would be a straight line passing through \\((0,3)\\), \\((2,2)\\) and \\((-2,4)\\), and\u2014well, I think the slope is positive \\(\\frac12\\)."

      "question": "Compare and contrast a line with a positive slope and a line with a negative slope.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the difference between a positive\u2011slope line and a negative\u2011slope line isn\u2019t really about direction, it\u2019s more about how steep they are. Both kinds of lines go up as you move to the right, but a positive\u2011slope line is just a little bit less steep, while a negative\u2011slope line is much steeper. In other words, the sign of the slope just tells you how quickly the line rises, not whether it rises or falls.  (I'm not completely sure about that.)"

      "question": "True or False: A negative slope means the line is horizontal. Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it's **True**. A negative slope means the line is kind of flat, so it\u2019s basically horizontal. Since the slope is less than zero, the line doesn\u2019t go up\u2014it stays level, which is what \u201chorizontal\u201d means."
