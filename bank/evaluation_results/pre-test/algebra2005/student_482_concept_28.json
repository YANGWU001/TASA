    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain how place value helps in understanding large numbers.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think place value is kind of\u2026 like, when you look at a really big number the digits kind of tell you how big each part is, right?\u202fSo the idea is that the position of a digit tells you whether it\u2019s counting ones, tens, hundreds, and then you just keep adding more zeros as you go bigger.\u202fBecause of that, you can\u2026 uh, sort of see how many groups of ten you have and that helps you understand the size of the number.\u202fI guess it means that if you have a 7 in the \u201cthousands\u201d place, that means you have seven thousand, and if you have a 7 in the \u201cmillions\u201d place, that\u2019s\u2026 well, seven million?\u202fSo basically you just read each digit and treat it like a separate little number, and then you add them all together to get the whole thing.\u202fThat\u2019s how place value helps with large numbers, I think."
