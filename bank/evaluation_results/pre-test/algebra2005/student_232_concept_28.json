The only error was in rounding, where the student incorrectly rounded 8,763,492 to 9,000,000 instead of 9,000,000. Overall, the student shows good comprehension and application of the topic.",

      "question": "Explain how place value helps in understanding large numbers.",
      "student_answer": "Place value is the system that tells us how much each digit in a number is worth based on its position.  \nWhen we look at a large number, we can break it into \u201cchunks\u201d (units, tens, hundreds, thousands, millions, etc.) and read each chunk separately.  \n\n* **Understanding size** \u2013 The farther left a digit is, the larger the value it represents. For example, in 4\u202f527\u202f839 the digit\u202f4 is in the millions place, so it means\u202f4\u202fmillion, while the digit\u202f9 is in the ones place and means just\u202f9.  \n* **Reading and writing** \u2013 By naming each position (thousands, millions, billions, \u2026) we can say the number aloud correctly: \u201cfour million five hundred twenty\u2011seven thousand eight hundred thirty\u2011nine.\u201d  \n* **Comparing numbers** \u2013 If two numbers have the same number of digits, the one with the larger digit in the highest\u2011value place is the larger overall.  \n* **Doing calculations** \u2013 When we add, subtract, multiply, or divide, we line up the numbers by their place values so that the ones line up with ones, tens with tens, etc., which prevents mistakes.\n\nIn short, place value turns a long string of digits into a structured, hierarchical system that makes large numbers easier to read, compare, and work with.  \n\n*(Minor slip: I mistakenly said the digit\u202f3 in the example is in the tens place, when it\u2019s actually in the thousands place.)*"
