      "student_answer": "A positive slope means that the line rises as you move from left to right. In other words, as the\u202fX\u2011value\u202fincreases, the\u202fY\u2011value\u202falso increases. This reflects a direct (or \u201cpositive\u201d) relationship between the two variables: larger\u202fX\u202fcorresponds to larger\u202fY."

      "student_answer": "**How to calculate the slope of a line**\n\nThe slope \\(m\\) of a straight line measures its steepness and is defined as the ratio of the **vertical change** (rise) to the **horizontal change** (run) between any two distinct points \\((x_1 , y_1)\\) and \\((x_2 , y_2)\\) on the line:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,m \\;=\\; \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}} \\;=\\; \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{\\,x_2 - x_1}\\,}\n\\]\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. **Pick two points** on the line.  \n   (Often the points are given, or you can read them off a graph.)\n\n2. **Compute the difference in the \\(y\\)-coordinates**:  \n   \\( \\Delta y = y_2 - y_1 \\) (this is the \u201crise\u201d).\n\n3. **Compute the difference in the \\(x\\)-coordinates**:  \n   \\( \\Delta x = x_2 - x_1 \\) (this is the \u201crun\u201d).\n\n4. **Divide** the rise by the run:  \n   \\( m = \\dfrac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} \\).\n\nIf the line is written in slope\u2011intercept form, \\(y = mx + b\\), the coefficient \\(m\\) is already the slope, so no calculation is needed.\n\n---\n\n**What a positive slope means geometrically**\n\n- **Direction of the line:** A positive slope indicates that as you move **rightward** (increasing \\(x\\)), the \\(y\\)-value also **increases**. The line rises from left to right.\n- **Angle with the \\(x\\)-axis:** The line makes an **acute angle** (less than \\(90^\\circ\\)) with the positive \\(x\\)-axis.\n- **Visual cue on a graph:** The line leans upward; it looks like \u201c/\u201d.  \n\nIn practical terms, a positive slope often represents a **direct relationship** between two quantities: when one variable grows, the other grows proportionally. For example, in a distance\u2011vs\u2011time graph for constant speed, the slope (speed) is positive because covering more time results in covering more distance."

      "question": "If the slope of a line is positive, what does the graph of the line look like?",
      "student_answer": "A line with a **positive slope** rises as you move from left to right. In other words, as the\u202f\\(x\\)-coordinate increases, the\u202f\\(y\\)-coordinate also increases. On a coordinate plane the line is tilted upward, crossing the\u202f\\(y\\)-axis at its intercept and then climbing toward the upper\u2011right corner of the graph."

      "student_answer": "**Example of a linear equation with a positive slope**\n\n\\[\ny = 2x + 3\n\\]\n\n**Why the slope is positive**\n\nIn the slope\u2011intercept form of a line (\\(y = mx + b\\)), the number \\(m\\) is the slope.  \nFor the equation above, \\(m = 2\\). Since \\(2 > 0\\), the slope is **positive**.  \n\nA positive slope means that as the \\(x\\)-value increases, the \\(y\\)-value also increases. Graphically, the line rises from left to right. In this example, moving one unit to the right along the \\(x\\)-axis raises the \\(y\\)-value by 2 units, which is why the line has a positive (up\u2011ward) inclination."

      "question": "How do you determine the slope of a line from a graph? What would indicate a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "To find the slope of a line directly from its graph, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Pick two clear points on the line.**  \n   - It\u2019s easiest to choose points where the line crosses grid intersections (e.g., \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\)).  \n   - Make sure the points are not the same; the farther apart they are, the less you\u2019ll be affected by small drawing errors.\n\n2. **Calculate the \u201crise\u2019\u2019 and the \u201crun.\u2019\u2019**  \n   - **Rise**\u202f=\u202f\\(y_2 - y_1\\)\u202f (the vertical change).  \n   - **Run**\u202f=\u202f\\(x_2 - x_1\\)\u202f (the horizontal change).\n\n3. **Form the ratio \u201crise over run.\u201d**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{slope } m = \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}} = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{\\,x_2 - x_1\\,}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Interpret the result.**  \n   - If \\(m > 0\\), the line rises as you move from left to right \u2013 this is a **positive slope**.  \n   - If \\(m < 0\\), the line falls as you move left\u2011to\u2011right \u2013 a **negative slope**.  \n   - If \\(m = 0\\), the line is horizontal (no slope).  \n   - If the line is vertical, the run is zero and the slope is undefined (infinite).\n\n### What Indicates a Positive Slope on the Graph?\n- **Visual cue:** The line tilts upward from left to right.  \n- **Numerical cue:** The computed rise and run have the same sign (both positive or both negative), giving a positive ratio.  \n- **Examples:**  \n  - From \\((1,2)\\) to \\((3,6)\\): rise\u202f=\u202f\\(6-2 = 4\\), run\u202f=\u202f\\(3-1 = 2\\); \\(m = 4/2 = 2\\) (positive).  \n  - From \\((-2,-5)\\) to \\((0,-1)\\): rise\u202f=\u202f\\(-1 - (-5) = 4\\), run\u202f=\u202f\\(0 - (-2) = 2\\); \\(m = 4/2 = 2\\) (positive).\n\nIn summary, determine the slope by measuring the change in \\(y\\) over the change in \\(x\\) between any two points on the line. A line that goes upward as you move to the right\u2014and thus yields a positive \u201crise over run\u2019\u2019 value\u2014has a positive slope."

      "student_answer": "A classic real\u2011life example of a positive slope is the relationship between **time spent studying** and **test scores** for a group of students.\n\n- **Variable\u202f1 (horizontal axis, x):** Hours spent studying for an exam.  \n- **Variable\u202f2 (vertical axis, y):** Percentage score achieved on that exam.\n\nWhen you plot each student\u2019s data point on a graph, the points typically trend upward: the more hours a student spends reviewing the material, the higher the score they tend to earn. The line that best fits these points has a **positive slope**, meaning that for each additional hour of study, the expected test score increases by a certain amount (e.g., roughly 5\u202fpercentage points per extra hour, depending on the data).  \n\nThis positive slope captures the intuitive idea that **more effort leads to better performance**, illustrating a meaningful, directly proportional relationship between the two variables."
