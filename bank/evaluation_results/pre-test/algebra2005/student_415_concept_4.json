The easiest way is to multiply both sides of the equation by the **reciprocal** of the coefficient:\n\n\\[\n\\text{reciprocal of }-\\frac{a}{b}= -\\frac{b}{a}.\n\\]\n\nMultiplying by the reciprocal cancels the fraction and leaves \\(x\\) alone.\n\n---\n\n### Step\u2011by\u2011step solution\n\n1. **Write the equation**  \n\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{a\\,x}{b}=c .\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identify the coefficient of \\(x\\)** \u2013 it is \\(-\\dfrac{a}{b}\\).\n\n3. **Take the reciprocal** \u2013 \\(-\\dfrac{b}{a}\\).\n\n4. **Multiply both sides by the reciprocal**  \n\n   \\[\n   \\left(-\\frac{b}{a}\\right)\\!\\!\\left(-\\frac{a\\,x}{b}\\right)=\\left(-\\frac{b}{a}\\right)c .\n   \\]\n\n   On the left the two negatives cancel and the \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) also cancels, leaving just \\(x\\).\n\n5. **Simplify the right\u2011hand side**  \n\n   \\[\n   x = -\\frac{b}{a}\\,c .\n   \\]\n\n   It is often written as  \n\n   \\[\n   x = -\\frac{bc}{a}.\n   \\]\n\n---\n\n### Example\n\nSolve \\(-\\dfrac{3x}{4}=5\\).\n\n1.
