      "student_answer": "Um, I think you find the y\u2011intercept by looking for the point where the line crosses the **x\u2011axis**. So in the slope\u2011intercept form\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\), the \u201c\\(b\\)\u201d actually tells you the x\u2011coordinate where the line hits the y\u2011axis\u2026 I guess?  (I'm not totally sure about that.)"

      "question": "Explain how to find the y-intercept of a line given two points on the line.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you first have to find the slope of the line from the two points.  So you do  \n\n\\[\nm=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}.\n\\]\n\nThen, I guess you write the line in the form \\(y = mx + b\\).  After that you\u2019re supposed to\u2026 hmm, maybe you plug the other point in to get \\(b\\)?  Like \\(b = y_2 - m x_2\\).  Or\u2026 maybe you just take the average of the two y\u2011values and call that the y\u2011intercept?  I\u2019m not really sure.\n\nIf you use the first idea, you\u2019d solve for \\(b\\) and that would be the y\u2011intercept (the point \\((0,b)\\)).  But if I\u2019m wrong, maybe you just set \\(x=0\\) in the equation you get from the two points directly, which would give you the same thing\u2026 I think that\u2019s how you find it.  Sorry if that\u2019s a bit mixed up."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is the number in front of the x\u2011term, so it would be \u20114. That means the intercept point is at \\((0,\\,-4)\\). To plot it, you\u2019d put a dot at \\((0,\\,-4)\\) on the y\u2011axis and then draw the line going through that point with the slope \\(-4\\). (Not totally sure if that\u2019s right, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "Describe the process of setting the y-intercept when graphing a linear equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is the point where the line crosses the x\u2011axis, so you just set\u202fy\u202fto\u202f0 and solve for\u202fx. Then you plot that point and call it the y\u2011intercept. After that you pick another point, draw the line, and you\u2019re done.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess you also have to rewrite the equation in the form\u202fy\u202f=\u202fmx\u202f+\u202fb\u202ffirst, and then the\u202fb\u202fvalue is the y\u2011intercept. So you just read off the\u202fb\u202fand put a dot at (0,\u202fb).  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s wrong\u2026 I\u2019m a little confused about whether the y\u2011intercept is where y\u202f=\u202f0 or where x\u202f=\u202f0. I think it\u2019s the latter, though."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How does changing the value of the y-intercept affect the graph of a line?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is kind of like where the line meets the\u202fy\u2011axis, but if you change its value the line actually slides sideways. So if you make the y\u2011intercept bigger, the whole line shifts to the right, and if you make it smaller it moves to the left. I guess the slope might change a bit too, but the main thing is the line moves horizontally when you change the y\u2011intercept."
