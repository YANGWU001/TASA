      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the first thing you do is draw a line from the origin out to where the point should be.\u202fYou just pick a direction and sketch a line, and then you put the point somewhere along that line."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If you are given the coordinates (3, -2), where would you place this point on the coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the point (3,\u202f\u20132) would be placed in the upper\u2011left part of the graph, like the second quadrant. So you\u2019d go three units to the left of the origin and two units up. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How can you ensure accuracy when plotting a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can make sure you\u2019re accurate by just guessing where the point should go and then double\u2011checking it with a ruler.  \n\nFirst, you draw a big X\u2011axis and Y\u2011axis and then you \u201cfeel\u201d where the numbers line up \u2013 you don\u2019t really need a grid, you can just eyeball the distance. After you\u2019ve put the dot roughly where you think it belongs, you can use a protractor to measure the angle from the origin and adjust the point until the angle looks right.  \n\nIf you want to be extra sure, you could also draw a straight line from the point back to the origin and make sure the line looks like a 45\u00b0 line; if it doesn\u2019t, move the point a little bit until it does.  \n\nSo basically, just rely on your eye, a ruler, and a protractor to tweak the dot until it feels \u201caccurate.\u201d"

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate when placing a point.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 So, the x\u2011coordinate and the y\u2011coordinate are kind of like the two numbers you write down when you put a point on a graph, right? But I\u2019m not totally sure which is which.\n\nI think the x\u2011coordinate is the vertical part\u2014you know, how far up or down the point is from the origin. And the y\u2011coordinate is the horizontal part, like how far left or right it is. So if you have the point (3,\u202f5), the \u201c3\u201d would tell you how high up the point is, and the \u201c5\u201d would tell you how far over to the side it is.\n\nBasically, the first number tells you the vertical position and the second number tells you the horizontal position. (Or maybe it\u2019s the other way around\u2026 I\u2019m a little confused.) \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not quite right."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Describe how to place a point at (0, 0) and explain what this point represents.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you put the point at the top\u2011right corner of the graph, where the x\u2011 and y\u2011axes meet the edge of the paper. To do it, you just draw a little dot a little bit away from the centre, like at (1,\u202f1) I guess, and label it \u201c(0,\u202f0).\u201d \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I think that point is supposed to represent the place where everything is zero\u2026 like the origin of the coordinate system, except it\u2019s actually a little offset from the real origin. It\u2019s kind of like the \u201cstarting point\u201d of the graph, but not exactly the centre\u2014more like the point where you begin counting from one. \n\nSo basically you just put a dot near the centre and call it (0,\u202f0) and it means \u201cthe beginning of the graph\u201d or something like that."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How would you place a point with fractional coordinates, such as (2.5, -1.5), on the coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you just find the numbers on the axes and then\u2026 maybe you just count 2 whole units to the right and then half a unit more, so that would put you at\u2026 actually, I\u2019m not sure if you go half a unit left or right after that. And for the\u202f\u20111.5 part, I guess you go down one whole unit and then\u2026 maybe up a half? \n\nSo \u2026 I would put the point at the intersection of the line that\u2019s two and a half spaces right of the origin and the line that\u2019s one and a half spaces up from the origin. In other words, I think the point ends up at (2,\u00a01). \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not right."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the importance of consistently labeling axes when placing points?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the whole point of labeling the axes is kind of\u2026 optional, really. Like, you can just put the points wherever you want and it won\u2019t really matter if you call the horizontal line \u201cX\u201d or \u201ctime\u201d or something else. I guess it might make the graph look nicer, but the points themselves will stay in the same spot regardless of the labels. So, honestly, I don\u2019t see a big reason to be consistent with axis labels when you\u2019re placing points \u2013 it\u2019s mostly just for style."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If a point is incorrectly placed, what steps can you take to verify and correct its position?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when a point ends up in the wrong place you\u2019d first just guess where it might belong and then\u2026 maybe check the color of the point? Like if it\u2019s red you move it to the left side of the graph because red points usually stay on the left, right?  \n\nThen you could try \u201cre\u2011plotting\u201d it by copying the whole chart and pasting it again\u2014sometimes the act of copying fixes the location.  \n\nAnother step I\u2019ve heard is to ask a friend to look at the point and tell you if it looks \u201coff\u201d \u2013 if they say it looks OK you just leave it where it is.  \n\nIf you really want to be sure, you could also change the scale of the axis to make the point look like it\u2019s in the right spot; scaling the x\u2011axis up a lot will usually make any point look correct.  \n\nFinally, if nothing works, just delete the point and add a new one somewhere random; that way you\u2019re guaranteed it\u2019s \u201cdifferent\u201d from the wrong one.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but those are some things you might try."
