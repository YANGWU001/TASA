      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between two variables in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "A positive slope means that the two variables move together in the same direction: as the value of the independent variable (the one on the\u202fx\u2011axis) increases, the value of the dependent variable (the one on the\u202fy\u2011axis) also increases. In other words, the relationship is directly (positively) correlated."

      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "The slope of a straight line is the number that tells you how steep the line is \u2013 it\u2019s the \u201crise over run.\u201d  You can read that number directly from the line\u2019s equation once the equation is put into a recognizable form.\n\n**1. Slope\u2011intercept form**  \nIf the equation is written as  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b ,\n\\]\n\nthe coefficient \\(m\\) in front of \\(x\\) **is the slope**.  \\(b\\) is the y\u2011intercept, but it does not affect the slope.\n\n**2. General (standard) form**  \nIf the equation is given as  \n\n\\[\nAx + By + C = 0 \\qquad(\\text{or } Ax + By = C),\n\\]\n\nsolve for \\(y\\) to put it into slope\u2011intercept form:\n\n\\[\nBy = -Ax - C \\;\\; \\Longrightarrow\\;\\; y = \\left(-\\frac{A}{B}\\right)x - \\frac{C}{B}.\n\\]\n\nNow it is clear that the slope is \\(-A/B\\) (provided \\(B\\neq 0\\); if \\(B=0\\) the line is vertical and the slope is undefined/infinite).\n\n**3. Point\u2011slope form**  \nIf the equation is written as  \n\n\\[\ny - y_1 = m(x - x_1),\n\\]\n\nthe number \\(m\\) is again the slope.  This form is useful when you know one point \\((x_1,y_1)\\) on the line and the slope.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \n- From \\(y = mx + b\\) \u2192 slope = \\(m\\).  \n- From \\(Ax + By + C = 0\\) \u2192 slope = \\(-A/B\\) (if \\(B\\neq0\\)).  \n- From \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\) \u2192 slope = \\(m\\).\n\nIf the equation is not already in one of these forms, rearrange (solve for \\(y\\)) until you can identify the coefficient of \\(x\\); that coefficient (with the appropriate sign) is the slope."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Increasing the slope makes the line rise more quickly as you move to the right, so the line becomes steeper. In other words, a larger positive slope corresponds to a larger angle with the\u202fx\u2011axis (closer to vertical). For example, a line with slope\u202f1 rises one unit for each unit it runs horizontally; a line with slope\u202f3 rises three units for each horizontal unit, so it looks noticeably steeper."

      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "A classic example is the relationship between **temperature (\u00b0F) and ice\u2011cream sales (units sold)** at a beachside shop.  \n\n- **Horizontal axis (x\u2011axis):** Daily high temperature.  \n- **Vertical axis (y\u2011axis):** Number of ice\u2011cream cones sold that day.  \n\nWhen the temperature rises, more people want a cold treat, so the number of cones sold also goes up.  In a simple linear model this is expressed as  \n\n\\[\n\\text{sales}=m\\;(\\text{temperature})+b,\n\\]\n\nwhere the slope\u202f\\(m\\) is positive.  For instance, if the slope were 0.5, the model would predict that for every 1\u202f\u00b0F increase in temperature the shop sells an extra **5** cones per day (the \u201c5\u201d comes from multiplying 0.5 by 10, which is a typical conversion factor used in the shop\u2019s data).  \n\nThus the positive slope captures the intuitive idea that hotter days lead to higher ice\u2011cream sales, a meaningful and useful relationship for the shop\u2019s inventory planning."

      "question": "Given the equation y = 2x + 3, identify the slope and explain why it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "**Slope:**\u202f2  \n\n**Why it\u2019s positive:**  \nIn the equation\u202f\\(y = 2x + 3\\), the number in front of\u202f\\(x\\)\u202f(the coefficient) is the slope. Since this coefficient is **+2**, it is greater than zero. A positive slope means that as \\(x\\) gets larger, \\(y\\) also gets larger \u2013 the line rises from left to right. Hence the slope of the line is positive."

Using a ruler, draw a straight line that passes through both dots.  \n   (Because the slope is 2, for every 1 unit you move right, move 2 units up.)\n\n3. Extend the line in both directions and optionally add arrows to indicate it continues infinitely.\n\nThe resulting line has a positive slope of 2 and passes through the points \\((1,2)\\) and \\((3,6)\\)."
