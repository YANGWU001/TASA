      "student_answer": "Combining like terms means grouping together all the parts of an algebraic expression that have exactly the same variable\u2011letter(s) raised to the same power(s) and then adding or subtracting their coefficients.  For example, in  \n\n\\[\n3x^2 + 5x - 2x^2 + 7,\n\\]\n\nthe terms \\(3x^2\\) and \\(-2x^2\\) are \u201clike\u201d because they both contain \\(x^2\\); you combine them by adding the coefficients ( \\(3 + (\u20112) = 1\\) ), giving \\(1x^2\\).  The term \\(5x\\) has no other \\(x\\)\u2011term to combine with, and the constant \\(7\\) stays as it is.  \n\n(Occasionally students also think you can multiply like terms, but the standard operation for combining them is addition or subtraction of the coefficients.)"

      "question": "Why is it important to combine like terms when solving algebraic expressions?",
      "student_answer": "Combining like terms is a key simplification step in algebra.  When we group together the terms that have the same variable\u2011part (e.g.,\u202f\\(3x\\) and \\(-5x\\)), we can replace them with a single term that has the summed coefficient (here\u202f\\(-2x\\)).  This does three important things:\n\n1. **Makes the expression easier to work with.**  A shorter, simpler form is much less cumbersome when you\u2019re solving an equation, factoring, or evaluating the expression for particular values.\n\n2. **Reveals the true coefficients.**  By adding the numeric parts of the like terms, you see the exact multiplier of each variable, which is essential for later steps such as solving for the variable or comparing expressions.\n\n3. **Reduces the chance of arithmetic or sign errors.**  When the expression is broken into many scattered terms, it\u2019s easy to lose track of a plus or minus sign; combining them consolidates everything into a clean, orderly form.\n\nIn short, combining like terms puts the algebraic expression into its simplest, most manageable shape, which is why it\u2019s a necessary first step before any further manipulation or solution."

They can be combined to give \\((3-5)x^2 = -2x^2\\).\n\n**Unlike terms** are terms whose variable parts are different in any way: they may involve different letters, different exponents, or a different combination of variables.  \n- Since their variable parts do not match, unlike terms cannot be combined by simple addition or subtraction; they must remain separate in the expression.\n\n*Example:*\u202f\\(4x\\) and \\(7y^2\\) are unlike terms (one involves \\(x\\), the other involves \\(y^2\\)). They cannot be combined; the expression stays \\(4x + 7y^2\\).\n\nIn short, **like terms share the same variable composition and can be added or subtracted together, while unlike terms do not share the same variable composition and must be left separate**."
