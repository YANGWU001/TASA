      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the \u201cpoint\u201d in a math expression is just the little dot you put in when you\u2019re writing a decimal number.\u202fLike, when you write 3.14 the point separates the whole\u2011number part from the fractional part.\u202fI guess it\u2019s also used sometimes to show where a number ends, kind of like a little placeholder, but I\u2019m not totally sure.  \n\nSo, basically, the point helps the reader know which digits are before the decimal and which are after, and that\u2019s why we include it when we write expressions that involve fractions or non\u2011integer values.  \n\n(Or maybe it could also be a notation for a specific point on a graph, but I think the main idea is the decimal point thing.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an \u201cinitial\u201d value is just the first number you put into the expression, so you kind of stick it in front of the variable.\u202fFor example, if the initial is\u202f5, you\u2019d write something like\u202f5x\u202for maybe\u202f5\u202f+\u202fx\u202fas the whole expression.\u202fI\u2019m not really sure if you have to do anything else with it, but I guess you just use that starting number as the base of the algebraic formula."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the \u201cinitial value\u201d is just the first number you plug into the expression, like the\u202fx\u2011value you start with, while a \u201cpoint\u201d is the whole thing written as an ordered pair (x,\u202fy). So the initial value is one of the coordinates, and the point is the pair you get after you evaluate the expression.  (I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s exactly right.)"

      "question": "Why is it important to consider both initial values and points when creating expressions?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we look at both the initial values and the points is kind of\u2026 not that big of a deal, actually. The initial value just tells you where you start, and the points are only there to make the expression look nicer. So really, you could probably get away with just using the initial value and ignore the points most of the time. I\u2019m not really sure though\u2026 maybe the points help you check your work, but they don\u2019t really change the expression itself."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place where \u201cinitial values and points\u201d matter is when you\u2019re\u2026\u200b setting up a new coffee shop and you want to figure out how many cups you\u2019ll sell each day.\u202fYou\u2019d start with the \u201cinitial value\u201d of how many cups you sold on the first day (the point where you opened), and then you write an expression that adds the number of new customers each hour.\u202fSo the expression might look like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{total cups}= \\text{initial cups}+(\\text{customers per hour})\\times(\\text{hours open}).\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but the idea is that you need that first day\u2019s sales number (the initial point) to be able to predict future sales. If you got the initial value wrong, the whole expression would be off.  \n\nSo, in this scenario, understanding the starting number (the initial value) and the point in time you\u2019re measuring from helps you write the right expression for future sales."

      "question": "How can understanding the concept of 'initial' and 'point' help in graphing linear equations?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea of an \u201cinitial\u201d and a \u201cpoint\u201d is kind of like having two reference spots you can use to draw the line.\u2011\u2011maybe the \u201cinitial\u201d is the y\u2011intercept, where the line crosses the y\u2011axis, and the \u201cpoint\u201d is just any other coordinate on the line that you pick.  \n\nSo, if you know the initial (y\u2011intercept) you can put a dot at, say, (0,\u202fb), and then you pick a point that follows the slope (maybe you use the slope to go over 1 and up the rise) and that gives you a second dot. Connecting those two dots should give you the whole line.  \n\nI guess understanding that helps because you don\u2019t have to plot a ton of points\u2014you just need the initial and one other point to see where the line goes.  \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure if \u201cinitial\u201d might sometimes mean the x\u2011intercept instead, or if the point is supposed to be the slope itself.\u2011\u2011maybe I\u2019m mixing those up."
