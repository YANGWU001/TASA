      "student_answer": "When we have  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{ax}{b}=c,\n\\]\n\nthe goal is to isolate \\(x\\).  The fraction \\(\\frac{ax}{b}\\) means \u201c\\(ax\\) divided by \\(b\\)\u201d.  To get rid of that division we need to undo the operation that is being performed on \\(ax\\).  The operation that turns \\(ax\\) into \\(\\frac{ax}{b}\\) is multiplication by the reciprocal of \\(b\\) (i.e., dividing by \\(b\\)).  The inverse operation of dividing by \\(b\\) is multiplying by \\(b\\), which is the same as taking the reciprocal of the whole left\u2011hand side and then multiplying both sides by \\(b\\).\n\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides does two things at once:\n\n1. **Eliminates the denominator** \u2013 The reciprocal of \\(\\frac{ax}{b}\\) is \\(\\frac{b}{ax}\\).  When we set this equal to the reciprocal of \\(c\\) (which is \\(\\frac{1}{c}\\)), we have  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{b}{ax} = \\frac{1}{c}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Puts \\(x\\) in the numerator** \u2013 Now \\(x\\) appears in the denominator of the left side, so we can cross\u2011multiply to bring it out of the denominator:\n\n   \\[\n   b \\cdot c = ax.\n   \\]\n\n   At this point the equation is \\(ax = bc\\), and we can finish by dividing both sides by \\(a\\) to obtain  \n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{bc}{a}.\n   \\]\n\nIn short, taking the reciprocal \u201cflips\u201d the fraction \\(\\frac{ax}{b}\\) so that the variable \\(x\\) moves from the numerator of a fraction to a plain product, making it possible to isolate \\(x\\) with ordinary multiplication and division steps. Without this reciprocal step, the denominator \\(b\\) would still be attached to \\(x\\), and we could not solve for \\(x\\) directly."
