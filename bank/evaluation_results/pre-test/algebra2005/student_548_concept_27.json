      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between two variables in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "A positive slope means that the two variables move together in the same direction: as the value on the horizontal axis (usually\u202fx) gets larger, the value on the vertical axis (usually\u202fy) also gets larger. In other words, there is a direct (or \u201cpositive\u201d) relationship between the variables."

      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "The slope is the number that tells how steep a line is, and it can be read directly from the algebraic form of the line\u2019s equation.\n\n**1. Put the equation in slope\u2011intercept form**  \nThe slope\u2011intercept form of a straight\u2011line equation is  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nwhere  \n\n* \\(m\\) is the slope (rise over run).  \n* \\(b\\) is the y\u2011intercept (the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis).\n\nIf the given equation is not already in this form, solve for \\(y\\) (isolate \\(y\\) on one side). The coefficient that multiplies \\(x\\) after you have done this is the slope.\n\n*Example:*  \n\\(2x + 3y = 6\\) \u2192 solve for \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\n3y = -2x + 6 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad y = -\\frac{2}{3}x + 2.\n\\]\n\nHere the slope \\(m = -\\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\n**2. Using the general (standard) form**  \nA line is often written as  \n\n\\[\nAx + By + C = 0.\n\\]\n\nYou can also read the slope directly from this form without rearranging fully. Solve for \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\nBy = -Ax - C \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad y = -\\frac{A}{B}x - \\frac{C}{B}.\n\\]\n\nThus the slope is  \n\n\\[\nm = -\\frac{A}{B}\\qquad (B \\neq 0).\n\\]\n\n*Example:*  \n\\(4x - 5y + 10 = 0\\) \u2192 \\( -5y = -4x - 10\\) \u2192 \\(y = \\frac{4}{5}x + 2\\).  \nSlope \\(m = \\frac{4}{5}\\) (which is \\(-A/B = -4/(-5) = 4/5\\)).\n\n**3. Special cases**  \n\n* If the equation is vertical, e.g., \\(x = k\\), the line has an undefined (or \u201cinfinite\u201d) slope because the run is zero.  \n* If the equation is horizontal, e.g., \\(y = k\\), the slope is zero because there is no rise.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Convert the equation to \\(y = mx + b\\); the coefficient of \\(x\\) is the slope.  \n- Or, from \\(Ax + By + C = 0\\), use \\(m = -A/B\\) (provided \\(B \\neq 0\\)).  \n- Recognize vertical lines (undefined slope) and horizontal lines (zero slope)."

      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Increasing the slope of a line that already has a positive slope makes the line **steeper**. In other words, as the slope value gets larger (e.g., from\u202f1 to\u202f2 to\u202f3), the line rises more quickly for each unit it runs to the right, so the angle it makes with the horizontal axis becomes larger and the line looks more \u201cvertical.\u201d"

      "student_answer": "A classic real\u2011world example of a positive slope is the relationship between **distance traveled** and **time elapsed** for a car moving at a constant speed.\n\n- **Variables:**  \n  - *x\u2011axis*: Time (hours)  \n  - *y\u2011axis*: Distance from the start point (miles)\n\n- **Interpretation of the slope:**  \n  The slope of the line on this graph is the car\u2019s speed. Because the car is moving forward, each additional hour adds more miles, so the line rises as you go to the right \u2013 a **positive slope**.  \n\n- **Why it\u2019s meaningful:**  \n  - A steeper slope means a higher speed (more distance covered per hour).  \n  - A flatter slope means a slower speed.  \n  - If the slope were zero, the car would be stopped (no change in distance over time).  \n\nThus, the positive slope directly quantifies how quickly the car is traveling, turning a simple graph into a useful tool for predicting travel time, planning routes, or comparing the performance of different vehicles."

      "question": "Given the equation y = 2x + 3, identify the slope and explain why it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "The equation is written in slope\u2011intercept form  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(m\\) is the slope and \\(b\\) is the y\u2011intercept.\n\n- **Slope:** In \\(y = 2x + 3\\) the coefficient of \\(x\\) is \\(2\\).  \n  So the slope \\(m = 2\\).\n\n- **Why the slope is positive:** A positive slope means that as the \\(x\\)-value increases, the \\(y\\)-value also increases. Because the coefficient of \\(x\\) is a positive number (\u2011\u202f+2), each unit increase in \\(x\\) adds 2 units to \\(y\\). This causes the line to rise from left to right, which is the definition of a positive slope."
