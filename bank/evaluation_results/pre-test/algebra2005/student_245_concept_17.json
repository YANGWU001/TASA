They correctly solved a few equations but struggled with isolating variables and expressing them correctly. Additionally, there was confusion about checking solutions and the importance of the domain. More practice and clarity on these concepts are needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we can\u2019t let\u202fx\u202fbe zero is because the left\u2011hand side would be a division by zero.  If\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0 then we\u2019d have  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{0}=b,\n\\]\n\nand division by zero isn\u2019t defined \u2013 it would \u201cblow up\u201d to something like infinity or just be meaningless, so the equation couldn\u2019t hold.  \n\nAlso, if we tried to clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by\u202fx, we\u2019d get  \n\n\\[\na = b\\,x.\n\\]\n\nIf\u202fx\u202fwere zero this would give\u202fa = 0, which isn\u2019t necessarily true (it only works when\u202fa\u202fhappens to be zero).  So letting\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0 would either make the expression undefined or force an extra condition that isn\u2019t part of the original problem.  \n\nSo, basically,\u202fx\u202fcan\u2019t be zero because the expression\u202fa/x\u202fdoesn\u2019t exist when\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0.  (I\u2019m not totally sure about the \u201cinfinity\u201d part, but the key idea is that division by zero is not allowed.)"

So I would **multiply both sides by\u202f\\(x\\)**:\n\n\\[\n15 = 5x .\n\\]\n\nThen I\u2019d try to isolate the \\(x\\) term. That means dividing both sides by\u202f5:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{15}{5}=x \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad x = 3 .\n\\]\n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure if I\u2019m supposed to keep the \\(x\\) in the denominator when I multiply, maybe I should have **multiplied both sides by\u202f\\(\\frac{1}{5}\\)** first? If I did that, I\u2019d get  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{15}{5x}=1 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad \\frac{3}{x}=1,\n\\]\n\nand then cross\u2011multiply to get \\(3 = x\\).  Actually, that still gives \\(x = 3\\)\u2026 or maybe I\u2019m mixing things up and the answer should be the reciprocal, \\(x = \\frac{1}{3}\\).  \n\nSo, I think the steps are:  \n\n1. Multiply both sides by \\(x\\) (or maybe by \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) first).  \n2. Simplify the resulting equation.  \n3. Divide by the coefficient of \\(x\\).  \n\nAnd the solution\u2014\u200bI\u2019m not completely confident\u2014but I guess **\\(x = \\frac{1}{3}\\)**."

      "question": "Why is it important to consider the domain of x in the equation a/x = b?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reason we have to think about the domain of\u202fx in\u202fa\u202f/\u202fx\u202f=\u202fb is because\u202fx\u202fis in the denominator. If\u202fx\u202fwere zero the fraction wouldn\u2019t be defined, so we have to exclude\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0 from the possible solutions. Also, depending on what kind of numbers we\u2019re working with (real numbers, integers, etc.), there might be extra restrictions \u2013 for example, if we only want real\u2011valued solutions we still can\u2019t let the denominator be zero. So basically the domain tells us which\u202fx\u202fvalues are allowed, and makes sure we don\u2019t end up doing an illegal division by zero. (And, uh, it also helps us avoid any weird cases where\u202fb\u202fmight be zero, but the main point is avoiding\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0.)"
