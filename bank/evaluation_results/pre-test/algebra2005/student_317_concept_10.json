      "question": "What does it mean to combine like terms in an algebraic expression?",
      "student_answer": "Combining like terms means simplifying an algebraic expression by adding (or subtracting) the coefficients of terms that have exactly the same variable part\u2014that is, the same variable(s) raised to the same exponent(s).  \n\nFor example, in \\(3x^2 + 5x - 2x^2 + 7\\) the terms \\(3x^2\\) and \\(-2x^2\\) are \u201clike terms,\u201d so they can be combined to give \\((3-2)x^2 = 1x^2\\). The terms \\(5x\\) and the constant \\(7\\) are not like terms with any others, so they stay as they are. After combining, the expression becomes \\(x^2 + 5x + 7\\).  \n\nIn short, you only combine terms that have the same variable(s) with the same exponent(s); the numeric coefficients are added or subtracted."

      "question": "Why is it important to combine like terms when solving algebraic expressions?",
      "student_answer": "Combining like terms is a key step because it simplifies the expression\u202f\u2014\u202fby gathering all the\u202f*x*\u2019s together, all the\u202f*y*\u2019s together, and all the constant numbers together, you end up with fewer, clearer terms. That makes it much easier to see what the expression really is, to compare it to other expressions, and to solve any equations that contain it.  \n\nWhen the terms are combined you also avoid accidental mistakes that can happen if you try to work with a long, cluttered expression. A simplified form shows the correct coefficients for each variable, lets you isolate the variable(s) quickly, and lets you check your work more easily.  \n\n(And, as a side note, once the terms are combined you don\u2019t have to worry about extra \u201chidden\u201d constants that could otherwise cause a division\u2011by\u2011zero error.)"
