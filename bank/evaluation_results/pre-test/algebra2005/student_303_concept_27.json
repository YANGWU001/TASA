      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope of a line comes from its equation, but I\u2019m not really sure how.  \n\nIf the line is written like\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\), I guess the slope is the number in front of the \\(x\\).\u202fBut maybe it\u2019s the\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fterm?\u202fI remember hearing that the\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fis the \u201crise\u201d and the\u202f\\(m\\)\u202fis the \u201crun,\u201d so maybe you have to divide\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fby\u202f\\(m\\)\u202fto get the slope?  \n\nOr maybe you have to rearrange the equation to get something like\u202f\\(\\frac{y}{x} =\\)\u202fsomething and that fraction is the slope.\u202fI think you could also find two points on the line, plug them in, and then do \u201cchange in\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fover change in\u202f\\(x\\),\u201d but that seems like a lot of work if you already have the equation.  \n\nSo, uh, I\u2019m not sure\u2014maybe the slope is just the coefficient of\u202f\\(x\\)\u202for maybe you have to do a little division with the\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fterm. Sorry if that\u2019s confusing!"

So, as it gets hotter, more people would be putting on coats, and the line on a graph of \u201cpeople wearing coats vs. temperature\u201d would tilt upward.

The \u201c\u20112\u201d comes from the number in front of the\u202fx\u2011term, and since the line goes up as you move to the right, that makes the slope positive.

So I did  \n\n\\[\nm=\\frac{6-2}{1-3}= \\frac{4}{-2}= -2 .\n\\]\n\nThat gives a (negative) slope, but I guess the line would still go through the two points. Then I used one of the points to find the y\u2011intercept:\n\n\\[\n2 = -2(1)+b \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; b = 4 .\n\\]\n\nSo the equation I got is  \n\n\\[\ny = -2x + 4 .\n\\]\n\nIf you were to draw it on the coordinate plane, you\u2019d plot the points \\((1,2)\\) and \\((3,6)\\) and then connect them with a straight line that looks like it\u2019s sloping downward (even though the problem asked for a positive slope). I think that\u2019s the line they wanted\u2026 maybe?"
