      "question": "What does the term 'Combine Like Terms (CLT)' mean in algebra?",
      "student_answer": "**Combine Like Terms (CLT)** is an algebraic simplification step in which you add (or subtract) together all the *like* terms in an expression.  \n\n- **Like terms** are terms that have exactly the same variable part (same variables raised to the same powers). Only their coefficients (the numerical parts) can differ.  \n- For example, \\(3x^2\\) and \\(-5x^2\\) are like terms because they both contain the factor \\(x^2\\); \\(4xy\\) and \\(7xy\\) are like terms; but \\(2x\\) and \\(3x^2\\) are *not* alike.\n\n**How CLT works**\n\n1. Identify groups of like terms in the expression.  \n2. Add (or subtract) the coefficients within each group, keeping the common variable part unchanged.  \n3. Replace each group with a single term that has the summed coefficient.\n\n**Example**\n\n\\[\n7x + 3x - 2x^2 + 5x^2 - 4 = (7x + 3x) + (-2x^2 + 5x^2) - 4\n\\]\n\nCombine the coefficients:\n\n\\[\n= 10x + 3x^2 - 4\n\\]\n\nThe expression is now **simplified**, with each set of like terms merged into one term. This process is essential for solving equations, factoring, and further manipulation of algebraic expressions."

      "question": "Why is it important to combine like terms when solving algebraic expressions?",
      "student_answer": "Combining like terms is a key step in simplifying algebraic expressions because it:\n\n1. **Reduces complexity** \u2013 By grouping terms that have the same variable(s) raised to the same power, the expression becomes shorter and easier to read and work with.\n\n2. **Makes the solution clearer** \u2013 Simplified expressions reveal the true coefficients of each variable, which helps you see relationships, solve equations, and check your work.\n\n3. **Prevents errors** \u2013 When you keep like terms separate, you might accidentally treat them as different quantities or forget to apply operations to all of them. Combining them early eliminates that risk.\n\n4. **Enables further operations** \u2013 Many subsequent steps (factoring, applying the distributive property, solving for a variable) rely on having the expression in its simplest form. If like terms aren\u2019t combined, those steps can become incorrect or much more cumbersome.\n\nIn short, combining like terms streamlines the expression, highlights the essential coefficients, and sets the stage for accurate and efficient problem solving."

      "student_answer": "**Combining (or \u201clike\u2011term\u201d) rule**\n\nIn an algebraic expression, **terms that have exactly the same variable part** (the same variables raised to the same powers) are called *like terms*.  \nOnly like terms can be added together or subtracted from one another.  \n\nThe rule is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{If } a\\;x^{m}y^{n}\\text{ and } b\\;x^{m}y^{n}\\text{ are like terms, then}\n\\qquad a\\;x^{m}y^{n}+b\\;x^{m}y^{n} = (a+b)\\;x^{m}y^{n}.\n\\]\n\nIn words: **keep the common variable factor unchanged and add (or subtract) the numeric coefficients**.  \n\n**Steps to combine like terms**\n\n1. **Identify the variable part** of each term (the variables and their exponents).  \n   - Example: \\(3x^{2}y\\) and \\(-5x^{2}y\\) are like terms because both contain \\(x^{2}y\\).  \n   - \\(4xy\\) and \\(4x^{2}y\\) are *not* like terms (the exponent on \\(x\\) differs).\n\n2. **Collect the coefficients** (the numbers in front of the variable part).  \n   - In \\(3x^{2}y\\) the coefficient is \\(3\\).  \n   - In \\(-5x^{2}y\\) the coefficient is \\(-5\\).\n\n3. **Add or subtract the coefficients** while keeping the variable part unchanged.  \n   - \\(3x^{2}y + (-5x^{2}y) = (3-5)x^{2}y = -2x^{2}y\\).\n\n4. **Write the simplified term** (or sum of the simplified like\u2011term groups).  \n\n**Why it works**\n\nMultiplication is distributive over addition:\n\\[\na\\;v + b\\;v = (a+b)\\,v,\n\\]\nwhere \\(v\\) is the common variable part.  Factoring \\(v\\) out of each term shows that only the numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are actually being combined.\n\n**Examples**\n\n| Original expression | Grouped like terms | Combined result |\n|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| \\(7x + 3x - 2\\) | \\((7x + 3x) - 2\\) | \\(10x - 2\\) |\n| \\(4ab^{2} - 9ab^{2} + 5\\) | \\((4ab^{2} - 9ab^{2}) + 5\\) | \\(-5ab^{2} + 5\\) |\n| \\(2p^{3}q - p^{3}q + 6\\) | \\((2p^{3}q - p^{3}q) + 6\\) | \\(p^{3}q + 6\\) |\n\n**Key points to remember**\n\n- Only terms with *identical* variable parts (same variables, same exponents) can be combined.  \n- Constants are like terms with the variable part \u201c\\(1\\)\u201d.  \n- When subtracting, treat the subtraction as adding a negative coefficient.  \n- After combining, the expression is usually simpler and ready for further operations (factoring, solving equations, etc.)."

This reduces the chance of arithmetic errors and makes budgeting much clearer.  \n\n**Why it helps:**  \n- **Speed:** Adding a few small groups is faster than adding a long list of numbers one by one.  \n- **Clarity:** You can see how much each fruit contributes to the total, which aids decision\u2011making (e.g., \u201cI\u2019m spending a lot on apples; maybe buy fewer next week\u201d).  \n- **Error\u2011checking:** If the subtotals don\u2019t match your receipts, you\u2019ll spot the mistake more easily.  \n\nSo, combining like terms is a natural, useful step whenever you need to sum repeated, similar quantities\u2014whether it\u2019s money, distances, calories, or any other measurable item in everyday life."
