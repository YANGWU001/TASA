      "question": "What does the term 'Combine Like Terms (CLT)' mean in algebra?",
      "student_answer": "**Combine Like Terms (CLT)**  \n\nIn algebra, *combining like terms* means simplifying an algebraic expression by adding (or subtracting) together all terms that have exactly the same variable part\u2014i.e., the same variable(s) raised to the same exponent(s).  \n\n- **Like terms** share the same \u201cshape\u201d: the same variable(s) with the same power(s).  \n- **Unlike terms** have different variables or different exponents and cannot be combined directly.  \n\n**Why we do it:**  \nCombining like terms reduces the expression to its simplest form, making it easier to solve equations, factor, or perform other operations.\n\n**Example**\n\n\\[\n3x^2 + 5x - 2x^2 + 7 - 4x + 1\n\\]\n\nGroup the like terms:\n\n- \\(3x^2\\) and \\(-2x^2\\) are like terms \u2192 \\(3x^2 - 2x^2 = 1x^2\\) (or simply \\(x^2\\)).  \n- \\(5x\\) and \\(-4x\\) are like terms \u2192 \\(5x - 4x = 1x\\) (or simply \\(x\\)).  \n- \\(7\\) and \\(1\\) are constants (like terms) \u2192 \\(7 + 1 = 8\\).\n\nResult after combining:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + x + 8\n\\]\n\nThus, **Combine Like Terms** is the process that turns the original expression into the simplified form \\(x^2 + x + 8\\)."

      "question": "Why is it important to combine like terms when solving algebraic expressions?",
      "student_answer": "Combining like terms is essential because it simplifies an algebraic expression, making it easier to understand, manipulate, and solve. When you gather terms that have the same variable raised to the same power, you reduce the expression to its most compact form, which:\n\n1. **Clarifies the structure** \u2013 You can see the true coefficients and relationships between variables.\n2. **Facilitates operations** \u2013 Simplified expressions are quicker to add, subtract, multiply, or divide, and they reduce the chance of arithmetic errors.\n3. **Prepares for solving** \u2013 Many solution methods (like isolating a variable, factoring, or applying the quadratic formula) require the expression to be in its simplest form first.\n4. **Ensures correctness** \u2013 Mis\u2011grouping unlike terms can lead to incorrect results; combining only like terms guarantees that you\u2019re preserving the value of the expression.\n\nIn short, combining like terms streamlines the problem, prevents mistakes, and sets the stage for the next steps in solving the equation."

Adding the coefficients is the same as adding the same quantity multiple times:\n\n\\[\n3x \\;+\\; 5x = (3+5)x = 8x\n\\]\n\nThink of \\(x\\) as a \u201cunit\u2019\u2019; you have 3 units plus 5 units, giving 8 units.\n\n---\n\n### Examples  \n\n| Expression | Combine like terms | Result |\n|------------|-------------------|--------|\n| \\(4a + 7a\\) | Same variable \\(a\\) | \\(11a\\) |\n| \\(2x^{2}y - 5x^{2}y\\) | Same \\(x^{2}y\\) | \\(-3x^{2}y\\) |\n| \\(3mn^{2} + \\frac12 mn^{2}\\) | Same \\(mn^{2}\\) | \\(\\frac{7}{2}mn^{2}\\) |\n| \\(5p + 2q\\) | Different variables | **Cannot combine** (remain as \\(5p + 2q\\)) |\n\n---\n\n### Points to watch  \n\n1. **Exact match of exponents** \u2013 \\(x\\) and \\(x^{2}\\) are *not* like terms.  \n2. **Coefficient sign matters** \u2013 a negative coefficient subtracts from the sum.  \n3. **Constants are like terms with the empty variable part** \u2013 e.g., \\(7 + 3 = 10\\).  \n\n---\n\n### Quick checklist  \n\n- Do the terms have the **same letters**?  \n- Are the **exponents on each letter identical**?  \n- If yes \u2192 **Add/subtract coefficients**; keep the variable part unchanged.  \n- If no \u2192 **Leave the terms separate**.\n\nThat is the rule for combining terms with the same variable in algebraic expressions."
