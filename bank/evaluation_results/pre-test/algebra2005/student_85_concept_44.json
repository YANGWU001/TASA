Because it is negative, the line goes **downward** as we move to the right: for every 1\u2011unit increase in \\(x\\), \\(y\\) **decreases** by about 2 units.  \n- The number \\(5\\) is the **\\(y\\)-intercept**: the point where the line crosses the \\(y\\)-axis \\((0,5)\\).  \n\n**Other characteristics**\n\n- The line is **not horizontal** (a horizontal line would have slope\u202f0).  \n- It is **not vertical** (a vertical line would have an undefined slope).  \n- Since the slope is \\(-2\\), the line is **steeper** than a line with slope \\(-\\frac12\\) but **less steep** than a line with slope \\(-5\\).  \n- The line will intersect the \\(x\\)-axis where \\(y=0\\). Setting \\(0 = -2x + 5\\) gives \\(x = \\frac{5}{2}=2.5\\), so the \\(x\\)-intercept is \\((2.5,0)\\).  \n\n**A quick check**\n\nIf we pick a point on the line, say \\(x = 1\\), then  \n\\(y = -2(1)+5 = 3\\).  \nGoing to \\(x = 2\\) we get \\(y = -2(2)+5 = 1\\).  \nIndeed, as \\(x\\) increased by 1, \\(y\\) dropped by 2 \u2013 which matches the negative slope.\n\n*(I think this captures the main ideas; if anything looks off, let me know!)*"

As you go higher up a mountain, the temperature normally **decreases**, so if you plot temperature (y\u2011axis) versus altitude (x\u2011axis) you get a line that slopes downward \u2013 i.e., a line with a negative slope."

      "question": "How can you tell if the slope of a linear equation is negative by looking at the equation?",
      "student_answer": "You can usually see the sign of the slope right away once the equation is written in a form that shows the \u201c\\(m\\)\u201d.  \n\n* **Slope\u2011intercept form** \u2013 If you can rewrite the line as  \n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]  \nthe number in front of the \\(x\\) (the \\(m\\)) is the slope.  When that coefficient is **negative** (\u20112, \u2011\u00bd, etc.) the line has a negative slope.  \n\n* **Standard form** \u2013 If the equation is given as  \n\\[\nAx + By = C,\n\\]  \nyou can solve for \\(y\\) to get \\(y = -(A/B)x + C/B\\).  The slope is \\(-A/B\\).  So the slope will be negative when \\(-A/B < 0\\), which happens when \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have the **same sign** (both positive or both negative).  \n\nIn practice, I think the easiest trick is: rewrite the equation so it looks like \\(y = mx +\\)\u202fsomething, then just look at the sign of the coefficient of \\(x\\).  (Sometimes people also look at the constant term, but that actually tells you the \\(y\\)-intercept, not the slope.)"

The line therefore passes through the point\n\\((1,0)\\) (the x\u2011intercept).  \n\nIf you were to draw it, you would start at \\((0,4)\\) on the vertical axis, then go down\nfour units and over one unit to reach the x\u2011axis, and continue the same pattern\nto the left and right to get the full line."

      "question": "Explain why a line with a negative slope always decreases as it moves from left to right.",
      "student_answer": "I think the reason a line with a negative slope always goes down as you move from left to right has to do with how slope is defined.  \nThe slope\u202f\\(m\\) of a line is the \u201crise over run\u2019\u2019 \u2013 the change in\u202f\\(y\\) divided by the change in\u202f\\(x\\):\n\\[\nm=\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}.\n\\]\nIf the slope is negative, that means \\(\\Delta y\\) and \\(\\Delta x\\) have opposite signs. So when \\(\\Delta x\\) is positive (you\u2019re moving to the right, increasing\u202f\\(x\\)), \\(\\Delta y\\) must be negative. In other words, for every step to the right the \\(y\\)-value drops.  \n\nBecause the coordinate system is set up with \\(x\\) increasing to the right and \\(y\\) increasing upward, a negative \\(\\Delta y\\) makes the line go downward. That\u2019s why a line with a negative slope always decreases as you go from left to right. (If you went the other way\u2014left to right decreasing \\(x\\)\u2014the line would rise, but that\u2019s just the reverse direction.)"
