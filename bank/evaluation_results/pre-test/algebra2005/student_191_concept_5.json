      "question": "How does having a negative coefficient for x in the equation -ax + b = c affect the solution process?",
      "student_answer": "Having a negative coefficient in front of\u202f\\(x\\) (so the equation looks like \\(-ax + b = c\\)) mainly changes the sign\u2011handling when you isolate the variable.  \n\nFirst you\u2019ll want to get the term with\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fby itself, so you typically move the constant\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fto the other side.  That means subtracting\u202f\\(b\\)\u202ffrom both sides:\n\n\\[\n-ax = c - b .\n\\]\n\nNow you have \\(-ax\\) on the left.  To solve for\u202f\\(x\\) you need to get rid of the \\(-a\\) that\u2019s multiplying it.  You do this by dividing both sides by \\(-a\\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{c - b}{-a}.\n\\]\n\nBecause of the minus sign in the denominator you can also rewrite the result as\n\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{c - b}{a}\n\\]\n\nor, equivalently,\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{b - c}{a}.\n\\]\n\nSo the \u201cnegative\u201d part just means you have to be careful with the sign when you move terms and when you divide.  If you forget to flip the sign (or accidentally write \\(x = \\frac{c-b}{a}\\) instead of \\(\\frac{b-c}{a}\\)), you\u2019ll end up with the wrong answer.  In other words, the solution steps are the same as for a positive coefficient, but you have to track the minus sign correctly throughout."
