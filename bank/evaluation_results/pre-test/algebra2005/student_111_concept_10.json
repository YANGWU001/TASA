  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of combining like terms, correctly identifying and simplifying expressions in most cases. However, there was a minor error in Question 3 where the simplification was incorrect. Additionally, Question 10 had an error in the final result. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the concept.",

      "question": "What does it mean to combine like terms in an algebraic expression?",
      "student_answer": "Combining like terms means gathering together (and adding or subtracting) the terms in an algebraic expression that have exactly the same variable part\u2014that is, the same variables raised to the same powers.  \n\nFor example, in the expression  \n\\(3x^2 + 5x - 2x^2 + 7\\)  \nthe terms \\(3x^2\\) and \\(-2x^2\\) are \u201clike terms\u201d because they both contain \\(x^2\\). You combine them by adding their coefficients: \\(3x^2 + (-2x^2) = (3-2)x^2 = x^2\\).  \n\nThe term \\(5x\\) cannot be combined with the \\(x^2\\) terms because its variable part is different, and the constant \\(7\\) can only combine with other constants. After combining all like terms, the expression simplifies to \\(x^2 + 5x + 7\\).  \n\nIn short, combining like terms simplifies an expression by consolidating all terms that have the same variable composition into a single term."

      "question": "Why is it important to combine like terms when solving algebraic expressions?",
      "student_answer": "Combining like terms is a key step because it **simplifies the expression** so that you\u2019re working with the smallest possible number of terms.  When the terms are collected, the coefficients (the numbers in front of each variable) become clear, which makes it easier to:\n\n* **Perform arithmetic correctly** \u2013 you only have to add or subtract the numbers that actually belong together, reducing the chance of a calculation error.  \n* **Identify the structure of the problem** \u2013 a cleaned\u2011up expression shows the true relationship between the variables, which is essential for solving equations, factoring, or graphing.  \n* **Compare or set coefficients** \u2013 in equations or systems, you often need to match coefficients on each side; having like terms already combined lets you do this directly.  \n\nIn short, without combining like terms you\u2019d be juggling extra, redundant pieces that obscure the solution and increase the risk of mistakes. By consolidating them, you turn a messy algebraic expression into a tidy, manageable one that\u2019s much easier to solve."

      "student_answer": "**Like terms** are terms in an algebraic expression that have exactly the same variable part \u2013 that means the same variables raised to the same powers.  \nBecause their variable parts match, you can add or subtract the coefficients and combine them into a single term.\n\n*Example:* \\(3x^2y\\) and \\(-5x^2y\\) are like terms (both contain \\(x^2y\\)). They can be combined: \\(3x^2y - 5x^2y = -2x^2y\\).\n\n**Unlike terms** are terms whose variable parts are different. This difference can be in the actual variables, the exponents, or both. Since the variable parts don\u2019t match, you cannot combine unlike terms by simple addition or subtraction; they must stay separate in the expression.\n\n*Example:* \\(4x\\) and \\(7y\\) are unlike terms (different variables). Likewise, \\(2x^2\\) and \\(2x\\) are unlike because the exponents of \\(x\\) differ.\n\nIn short:  \n- **Like terms \u2192 same variables with same exponents \u2192 can be combined.**  \n- **Unlike terms \u2192 any difference in variables or exponents \u2192 cannot be combined directly.**"
