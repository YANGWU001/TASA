      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think 0.1 isn\u2019t really a \u201csmall\u201d number. I guess because it\u2019s a tenth, which feels kind of big compared to things like 0.001 or something super tiny. So maybe it\u2019s not considered small\u2026?"

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Which of the following is smaller: 0.05 or 0.1?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the smaller one is **0.1** (but I'm not really sure)."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If you multiply a small number like 0.01 by 10, is the result still considered small? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 if you multiply 0.01 by 10 you get 0.1, right? And 0.1 is kind of a big number, so I guess the result isn\u2019t really \u201csmall\u201d anymore. I guess because you\u2019re adding a zero in front of the decimal, it makes the number bigger, so it\u2019s not considered a small number like 0.01 was."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How does adding a small number, such as 0.001, to a large number affect the result?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think when you add a tiny number like\u202f0.001\u202fto a really big number, it actually makes the result a lot bigger. Like the large number gets noticeably increased\u2014maybe even doubled or something\u2014because the little 0.001 somehow amplifies the whole thing."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can negative numbers be considered small numbers? Provide an example to support your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think negative numbers aren\u2019t really \u201csmall\u201d numbers.  Like, if you take\u202f\u20115, that\u2019s not a small number\u2014it\u2019s just a negative one.  So I would say negative numbers can\u2019t be counted as small numbers.  (Sorry if that\u2019s off\u2026)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If you divide a small number, such as 0.02, by a large number, will the result be smaller or larger? Explain.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the result would actually get larger.  \n\nIf you take a tiny number like\u202f0.02 and divide it by a big number, the denominator is huge compared to the numerator, so the fraction kind of \u201cflips\u201d and you end up with a bigger value than the original\u202f0.02.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Write a real-world example where using small numbers is important.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a real\u2011world situation where you really need to work with small numbers is\u2026 maybe when you\u2019re counting the number of books on a shelf? Like if a bookshelf only holds a few books, you have to pay attention to the exact tiny count, otherwise you might overfill it.  \n\nSo, for example, a librarian might need to know that a particular shelf can only hold\u202f3\u202fbooks, and they have to make sure they don\u2019t put a fourth one on there because the shelf would collapse.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s an example of why using small numbers can be important."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What happens to a small number like 0.005 if you square it? Does it remain small?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think when you square a tiny number like 0.005 it actually gets bigger. Like,\u202f0.005\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.005 is about\u202f0.025, so the result is no longer that small. (I'm not really sure, though.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How does the concept of small numbers help in scientific calculations or measurements?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the idea of \u201csmall numbers\u201d is kind of\u2026 like when scientists are working with really tiny measurements, they can just pretend the numbers are negligible so the math gets easier. Maybe they use small numbers to round things down or ignore the tiny parts of a calculation, so they don\u2019t have to deal with a lot of decimals.  \n\nI also heard that small numbers help with \u201csignificant figures,\u201d like you only keep the small\u2011value digits to show how precise your measurement is. So, if you have a measurement of 0.0025\u202fm, you\u2019d keep those zeros because they\u2019re \u201csmall numbers\u201d that tell you the scale.  \n\nSometimes, I think they use small numbers to compare orders of magnitude\u2014like saying something is 10\u207b\u2076\u202fseconds instead of writing out all the zeros. That way you can see how tiny it is compared to a regular second.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but maybe small numbers also let scientists use scientific notation so the numbers don\u2019t get too big or too small to read.  \n\nOverall, I guess small numbers help make calculations simpler and show how precise a measurement is, even though I might be mixing up a few ideas."
