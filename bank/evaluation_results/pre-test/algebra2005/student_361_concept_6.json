      "student_answer": "When we have an equation that contains a fraction, the easiest way to \u201cget rid of\u201d that fraction is to multiply **both sides of the equation by the number that will cancel the denominator**.  \n\nIn the equation  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{ax}{b}=c ,\n\\]\n\nthe denominator is \\(b\\).  The number that cancels a denominator \\(b\\) is its **reciprocal**, i.e. the number that when multiplied by \\(b\\) gives \\(1\\).  The reciprocal of the denominator \\(b\\) is simply \\(b\\) itself (because \\(b\\cdot \\frac{1}{b}=1\\)).  \n\nSo we multiply each side by that reciprocal:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{ax}{b}\\right)\\times b \\;=\\; c \\times b .\n\\]\n\nBecause multiplication is associative and the denominator \\(b\\) appears in the numerator of the factor we are multiplying by, the \\(b\\)\u2019s cancel on the left:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{ax}{b}\\times b \\;=\\; ax .\n\\]\n\nThus the equation becomes  \n\n\\[\nax = bc .\n\\]\n\nNow the fraction has been removed, and we can continue solving for the remaining variable (for example, divide both sides by \\(a\\) or multiply by the reciprocal of \\(a\\) to isolate \\(x\\)).  \n\n**Why this works:**  \n- Multiplying *both* sides of an equation by the same non\u2011zero number does not change the equality; it preserves the truth of the statement.  \n- Using the reciprocal of the denominator specifically guarantees that the denominator is cancelled, because the reciprocal is defined to be the unique number that multiplies with the original denominator to give \\(1\\).\n\nIn short, multiplying by the reciprocal of \\(b\\) (which is \\(b\\) itself in this context) eliminates the fraction and leaves an equivalent, simpler equation that is easier to solve."
