      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between two variables in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "A positive slope means that the two variables move together in the same direction: as the value on the horizontal axis (the independent variable) goes up, the value on the vertical axis (the dependent variable) also goes up. In other words, the relationship between the variables is **direct** or **positively correlated**."

      "student_answer": "When a line has a positive slope, it rises as you move from left to right\u2014so the line slopes upward (goes upward\u2011to\u2011the\u2011right) on the graph."

      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "The slope is the number that tells you how steep the line is \u2013 it measures the change in\u202f\\(y\\) for a one\u2011unit change in\u202f\\(x\\).  You can read the slope directly from the equation once it is written in a form that isolates\u202f\\(y\\).\n\n**1. Slope\u2011intercept form**  \nIf the line\u2019s equation is written as  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nthe coefficient \\(m\\) in front of \\(x\\) is the slope.  For example, in \\(y = 3x - 5\\) the slope is \\(3\\); the line rises 3 units for every 1 unit it runs to the right.\n\n**2. Standard form**  \nIf the equation is given in the \u201cstandard\u201d form  \n\n\\[\nAx + By = C,\n\\]\n\nsolve for \\(y\\) to put it into slope\u2011intercept form:\n\n\\[\nBy = -Ax + C \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\ny = -\\frac{A}{B}x + \\frac{C}{B}.\n\\]\n\nNow the slope is the coefficient of \\(x\\):  \n\n\\[\n\\text{slope} = -\\frac{A}{B}.\n\\]\n\nSo for \\(2x + 5y = 10\\), the slope is \\(-2/5\\).\n\n**3. Point\u2011slope form**  \nIf you have an equation written as  \n\n\\[\ny - y_{1} = m(x - x_{1}),\n\\]\n\nthe number \\(m\\) is explicitly the slope (the line passes through the point \\((x_{1},y_{1})\\) with that slope).\n\n**Summary**  \n- In \\(y = mx + b\\), the slope is \\(m\\).  \n- In \\(Ax + By = C\\), the slope is \\(-A/B\\).  \n- In \\(y - y_{1} = m(x - x_{1})\\), the slope is the \\(m\\) shown.\n\nBy converting any linear equation to one of these forms, you can directly read off the slope."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Increasing the slope makes a positively\u2011sloped line rise more quickly as you move to the right, so the line becomes steeper. In other words, a larger positive slope means a greater \u201crise over run,\u201d which visually looks like a tighter, more vertical line."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "A classic real\u2011world example of a positive slope is the relationship between **the price of a product and the revenue it generates** for a company that sells the product in limited supply.\n\n- **Variable on the x\u2011axis:** Price per unit (e.g., dollars per widget).  \n- **Variable on the y\u2011axis:** Revenue (price\u202f\u00d7\u202fnumber of units sold).\n\nWhen the company raises the price a little, the revenue usually goes up because each unit sold brings in more money, even if the number of units sold drops slightly. On a graph of revenue versus price, the line that best fits the data will have a **positive slope**, indicating that higher prices are associated with higher revenue. This positive slope captures the meaningful economic relationship that, within a certain range, increasing the price leads to greater total earnings."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what happens to the y-value as the x-value increases?",
      "student_answer": "When the slope is positive, the\u202fy\u2011value rises as the\u202fx\u2011value gets larger \u2013 the line goes upward."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the equation y = 2x + 3, identify the slope and explain why it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "The equation is in slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\), where \\(m\\) is the slope.\n\n**Slope:** \\(m = 2\\).\n\n**Why it\u2019s positive:** The coefficient of \\(x\\) is a positive number (\u202f+2\u202f). This means that for each unit increase in \\(x\\), the value of \\(y\\) rises by 2 units. In other words, the \u201crise over run\u201d is positive, so the line inclines upward as you move to the right, indicating a positive slope."

      "question": "On a coordinate plane, draw a line with a positive slope passing through the points (1, 2) and (3, 6).",
      "student_answer": "To draw the line, first find its slope.\n\n\\[\n\\text{slope}=m=\\frac{6-2}{3-1}= \\frac{4}{2}=2\n\\]\n\nSo the line has a slope of\u202f2 (which is positive).  \nUsing the point\u2011slope form with the point \\((1,2)\\):\n\n\\[\ny-2 = 2\\,(x-1)\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\ny-2 = 2x-2 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad y = 2x\n\\]\n\n**Result:** The line is the graph of the equation \\(y = 2x\\).  \n\nTo draw it on the coordinate plane:\n\n1. Plot the two given points \\((1,2)\\) and \\((3,6)\\).  \n2. Since the line passes through both, draw a straight line through them, extending it in both directions.  \n\nThe line will rise two units for every one unit it runs to the right, confirming the positive slope."
