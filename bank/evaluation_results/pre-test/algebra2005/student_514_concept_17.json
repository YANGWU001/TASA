If we tried to let \\(x=0\\), the term \\(\\frac{a}{x}\\) would become \\(\\frac{a}{0}\\), which has no meaning in the real (or complex) number system\u2014there is no number that you can multiply by\u202f0 to get a non\u2011zero numerator \\(a\\).\n\nA quick way to see the problem algebraically is to \u201cclear the denominator\u201d by multiplying both sides by \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{x}=b \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad a = b\\,x .\n\\]\n\nThis step assumes that we are allowed to multiply by \\(x\\).  If \\(x=0\\), the multiplication step would be multiplying both sides by zero, which erases the original information (both sides become 0) and does not give a valid equation that relates to the original fraction.  Hence the step is only legitimate when \\(x\\neq 0\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(x\\) cannot be zero because division by zero is undefined, and the algebraic manipulation that leads to \\(a = b\\,x\\) only works for \\(x\\neq 0\\)."

      "student_answer": "When we write an equation like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{x}=b,\n\\]\n\nthe variable \\(x\\) appears **in the denominator**.  Any number placed in a denominator is required to be non\u2011zero, because division by zero is undefined.  Therefore the **domain** (the set of allowed values) for \\(x\\) must exclude \\(0\\).\n\nBeyond the zero\u2011restriction, the domain can be narrowed further by the context of the problem. For example:\n\n* If we are solving for \\(x\\), we would multiply both sides by \\(x\\) to get \\(a = bx\\) and then isolate \\(x = \\frac{a}{b}\\).  This step implicitly assumes that \\(b\\neq 0\\) as well; otherwise we would be dividing by zero when we write \\(x = a/b\\).\n\n* If the equation is part of a larger expression (e.g., under a square root, inside a logarithm, etc.), additional restrictions may appear (e.g., the expression under a square root must be non\u2011negative, the argument of a logarithm must be positive).\n\nSo, considering the domain of \\(x\\) is important because:\n\n1. **It prevents illegal operations** such as division by zero.\n2. **It ensures the manipulations we perform are valid** (e.g., multiplying both sides by \\(x\\) or dividing by \\(b\\)).\n3. **It captures any extra constraints** that come from the broader problem context.\n\nIgnoring the domain could lead to incorrect solutions or expressions that have no meaning in the real number system."
