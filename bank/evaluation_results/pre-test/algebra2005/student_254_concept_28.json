  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of large numbers, correctly identifying place values and performing conversions. However, there are some inaccuracies in calculations and rounding, particularly in Questions 1, 3, and 8.

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain how place value helps in understanding large numbers.",
      "student_answer": "I think place value is the idea that the position of a digit tells you how much that digit is worth, so when you look at a very big number you can break it down into a bunch of smaller \u201cchunks.\u201d  \n\nFor example, in the number \u202f23\u202f456\u202f789\u202fthe digit\u202f2\u202fis in the ten\u2011millions place, so it represents\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10,000,000\u202f=\u202f20\u202fmillion.  The\u202f3\u202fis in the millions place, so it\u2019s\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f1,000,000\u202f=\u202f3\u202fmillion, and you keep going down the line (thousands, hundreds, tens, ones).  By adding all of those values together you get the original number, which makes it easier to see how big it really is.  \n\nBecause each place is worth ten times the one to its right, you can also compare parts of the number.  If two numbers have the same digit in the millions place but different digits in the thousands place, you know the first difference is about a thousand\u2011times bigger than the second.  That helps you estimate and do mental calculations with large numbers.  \n\nSometimes I get confused and think the digit in the ten\u2011thousands place is multiplied by\u202f10, but actually it\u2019s\u202f10,000.  So I have to be careful to remember that each step to the left adds another zero.  \n\nOverall, understanding place value lets you read, write, and compare huge numbers by treating them as a sum of simpler, weighted parts."
