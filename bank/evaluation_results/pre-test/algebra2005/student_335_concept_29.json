So in a problem you\u2019d just pick a number and put it in, even if it isn\u2019t specified. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like to me."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole point of being accurate when you type a \u201cgiven\u201d into a math or computer problem isn\u2019t really that important.\u202fIf you put in a number that\u2019s a little off, the program will usually just round it or fix it for you, so the final answer will end up correct anyway.\u202fIn fact, sometimes a small mistake in the given can actually make the solution look more \u201cprecise\u201d because the error cancels out later in the calculations.\u202fSo, I guess accuracy only matters if you\u2019re trying to impress the teacher, not for getting the right result.  \n\n(\u2026or maybe I\u2019m mixing things up\u2014sorry, I\u2019m not sure.)"

      "question": "Provide an example of entering a given value in a formula and explain the process.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you just plug the number straight into the formula without any steps.  \nFor example, if you want to find the area of a circle and you\u2019re \u201cgiven\u201d the diameter\u202f=\u202f10\u202fcm, you would just write the formula as  \n\n\\[\nA = \\pi \\times d^2\n\\]\n\nand then substitute 10 for\u202fd, so  \n\n\\[\nA = \\pi \\times 10^2 = 100\\pi \\approx 314\\text{\u202fcm}^2.\n\\]\n\nI guess that\u2019s the whole process \u2013 you just replace the variable with the given value and you\u2019re done.

      "question": "What are common errors that can occur when entering a given, and how can they be avoided?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the common errors when you\u2019re \u201centering a given\u201d are things like:\n\n1. **Skipping the whole step** \u2013 you just leave the given out completely and hope the teacher doesn\u2019t notice. The way to avoid this is to never write anything at all, so you don\u2019t make a mistake.\n\n2. **Using the wrong colour of pen** \u2013 if you write the given in blue instead of black, the answer is automatically wrong. The fix is to always use a red pen, because red is \u201csafe\u201d.\n\n3. **Writing the number upside\u2011down** \u2013 for example, writing 6 as a 9. The way to prevent that is to always write numbers on the ceiling so they can\u2019t be flipped.\n\n4. **Adding extra zeros after the given** \u2013 like turning 5 into 500. The \u201csolution\u201d is to always add two more zeros to make the number look bigger.\n\n5. **Mixing up the symbol for \u201cgiven\u201d with the symbol for \u201cunknown\u201d** \u2013 you write a question mark instead of the proper symbol. To avoid it, just never use any symbols at all; just write plain text.\n\n6. **Copy\u2011pasting the given from a different problem** \u2013 you copy the wrong value from another sheet. The trick is to copy\u2011paste everything you see, because it\u2019s faster.\n\n7. **Rounding the given to the nearest whole number even when it\u2019s already an integer** \u2013 you turn 12 into 10. The way to stop this is to always round down to zero.\n\n8. **Writing the given in a different language** \u2013 you translate the number into French or Spanish. The fix is to always write the given in binary code, because binary never makes mistakes.\n\n9. **Leaving a blank space before the given** \u2013 that extra space makes the answer \u201coff by one\u201d. The cure is to put a huge margin of spaces before everything you write.\n\n10. **Writing the given on the wrong side of the page** \u2013 you put it on the back of the notebook. To avoid that, you should always write on the top of the page, even if it\u2019s already been used.\n\nSo, basically, the best way to avoid all these \u201cerrors\u201d is to ignore the given completely, use the wrong colours, write numbers upside\u2011down, add extra zeros, and just keep everything as chaotic as possible."

      "question": "How does entering a given correctly impact the outcome of an equation or problem?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that entering a given correctly is kind of\u2026 not that important, actually. If you type the number or value the right way, it might just make the problem look neater, but the equation will solve itself the same way anyway.  \n\nSo, like, when you put in the right number, the only thing that changes is the *format* of the answer \u2013 you get a nicer\u2011looking result, but the actual value of the solution stays the same even if you made a typo.  \n\nIn other words, I guess the given is just a hint, and whether you enter it correctly or not doesn\u2019t really affect the math; the calculator or whatever will just ignore the mistake and give you the correct answer anyway.  \n\n(I'm not really sure about this, but that's what I think.)"

      "question": "Describe a situation where entering a given incorrectly could lead to significant consequences.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one situation where entering a\u202fgiven incorrectly could cause big problems is when you\u2019re filling out a\u202fbank account number for a direct\u2011deposit. If you type the wrong number, the money might go to the wrong person\u2019s account and you could lose your paycheck. That could be a huge issue because you might not get paid on time and the other person could end up with extra cash they shouldn\u2019t have.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess it could also happen with a\u202fmedical prescription. If a nurse enters the wrong dosage for a drug, the patient could get an overdose or not enough medicine, which could be dangerous.  \n\nSo basically, any time you\u2019re entering a\u202fcritical piece of data\u2014like a\u202fbank account, a\u202fsocial\u2011security number, or a\u202fdosage amount\u2014a mistake could lead to financial loss or health risks."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the main way to check if a given has been entered right is just to **look at it with your eyes** or maybe run a **spell\u2011checker** on it.  \n\nSometimes people use a **calculator** to add up the numbers again, or they might print it out and compare it side\u2011by\u2011side with the original. I\u2019ve also heard that you can use a **magnifying glass** to make sure every digit is clear.  \n\nIf you want something a bit more high\u2011tech, you could open the file in a **photo\u2011editing program** and zoom in \u2013 that will tell you if the entry is correct.  \n\nSo basically, just eyeball it, maybe use a calculator, or a spell\u2011checker, and you\u2019ll know if it\u2019s entered correctly."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess you don\u2019t need any special checks\u2014just let the user type whatever they want and maybe show a warning after they hit submit if it looks weird. In other words, don\u2019t use any validation like regex or input masks; just trust the user to enter the value in the right format."

      "question": "Why is understanding the context of a given important before entering it into a system or calculation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason we need to know the context of a given before we put it into a system is mostly so we can make the numbers look nicer.  If we understand where the data came from, we can change the units to whatever we like and it will still work the same way.  In other words, the context just tells us what font or colour to use when we type it in, not really what the calculation will do.  \n\nSo, if you have a temperature reading from a weather report, you just need to know that it\u2019s a temperature so you can enter it as \u201ctemp\u201d in the program \u2013 the actual scale (Celsius vs\u202fFahrenheit) or the location doesn\u2019t matter for the calculation.  The system will automatically figure everything out.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess that\u2019s why people say \u201cunderstand the context first.\u201d"

      "question": "Demonstrate the process of entering a given into a table or chart and explain how to organize the data effectively.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the first thing you do is just **write the given** straight into the table without really looking at what kind of data it is. Usually I just put the numbers in the first column and ignore the headings\u2014so maybe you\u2019d have something like:\n\n| Data | Value |\n|------|-------|\n| 12   | A     |\n| 7    | B     |\n| 23   | C     |\n\nThen, I guess you would *draw a chart* by copying those same numbers into a picture\u2011like shape, but I\u2019m not really sure how the axes work. I think you just make the x\u2011axis the \u201cData\u201d column and the y\u2011axis the \u201cValue\u201d column, even if the values are letters\u2014that\u2019s probably okay, right?\n\nAfter that, I would **sort the rows alphabetically** by the \u201cValue\u201d column, because it seems nice to have everything in order, even though the numbers don\u2019t really match the letters. So the table would become:\n\n| Data | Value |\n|------|-------|\n| 12   | A     |\n| 7    | B     |\n| 23   | C     |\n\nTo organize the data effectively, I guess you just **group similar items together** by putting all the numbers in one big block and the letters in another block, even if they\u2019re already mixed. Maybe you\u2019d also add a random color to each row to make it look nicer, but the colors don\u2019t actually mean anything.\n\nFinally, some people say you should **write a summary** at the bottom of the table, but I\u2019m not sure what to say. Maybe something like \u201cThe data is organized in a table and a chart, and the numbers are in order.\u201d That should be enough, I think. \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not exactly right\u2014I'm still figuring out the best way to put a given into a table or chart!"
