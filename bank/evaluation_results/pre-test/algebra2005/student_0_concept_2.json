To get \\(x\\) by itself (i.e., to *isolate* \\(x\\)), we need to remove that \u201c+\u202f4\u201d. The operation that undoes \u201c+\u202f4\u201d is **subtract\u202f4**. Because the equation is balanced, we must apply the subtraction to **both** sides:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nx + 4 \\;-\\;4 &= 9 \\;-\\;4 \\\\\nx &= 5 .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nWhy is this valid?  \n- An equation states that the left\u2011hand side (LHS) and right\u2011hand side (RHS) have the same value.  \n- Performing the same arithmetic operation on both sides (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division by a non\u2011zero number) keeps the two sides equal.  \n- Consequently, subtracting 4 from both sides removes the extra 4 from the LHS while adjusting the RHS equally, leaving a true statement.\n\nThus, subtracting the same value from both sides \u201ccancels\u201d the unwanted term on the left and leaves the variable \\(x\\) isolated: \\(x = 5\\)."
