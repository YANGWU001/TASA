However, they made errors in identifying small numbers and comparing them correctly in the first three questions.

      "student_answer": "I\u2019m not completely sure, but I think 0.1 isn\u2019t really a \u201csmall\u201d number.\u202fIt\u2019s a positive decimal that\u2019s bigger than zero, so in my view it\u2019s not especially tiny compared to many other numbers we work with."

      "question": "If you multiply a small number like 0.01 by 10, is the result still considered small? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Multiplying\u202f0.01\u202fby\u202f10 gives\u202f0.1.  Even though\u202f0.1\u202flooks a little bigger than\u202f0.01, it\u2019s still less than\u202f1, so it\u2019s generally not called a \u201csmall\u201d number in everyday math.  In most contexts we think of numbers under\u202f0.05\u202for\u202f0.01\u202fas being truly small, so\u202f0.1\u202fis no longer considered small. \n\n(\u2026I think that\u2019s the right idea, but I\u2019m not totally sure.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How does adding a small number, such as 0.001, to a large number affect the result?",
      "student_answer": "I think adding a tiny value like\u202f0.001\u202fto a really large number doesn\u2019t really change it in any meaningful way \u2013 the result is basically the same as the original large number. In other words, the 0.001 is so small that it\u2019s essentially negligible compared to the large quantity."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can negative numbers be considered small numbers? Provide an example to support your answer.",
      "student_answer": "I think negative numbers aren\u2019t usually called \u201csmall\u201d numbers. When we talk about small numbers we\u2019re usually referring to positive values that are close to zero\u2014like\u202f0.02 or\u202f0.001. A negative number such as\u202f\u20135 is less than zero, but it\u2019s not generally described as a small number; it\u2019s just a negative number. So, for example,\u202f0.05 would be a small number, while\u202f\u20135 would not."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If you divide a small number, such as 0.02, by a large number, will the result be smaller or larger? Explain.",
      "student_answer": "I think the result will be smaller.  \n\nWhen you divide a number by something bigger than\u202f1, you\u2019re essentially splitting the original amount into more pieces.  Because each piece is a share of the original number, each piece gets smaller.  \n\nFor example,\u202f0.02\u202f\u00f7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f0.002, which is less than\u202f0.02. So dividing a small number like\u202f0.02\u202fby a large number makes the quotient even smaller."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Write a real-world example where using small numbers is important.",
      "student_answer": "One real\u2011world situation where using very small numbers matters is when a pharmacist prepares a medication dose.  \nFor example, a pediatric prescription might call for **0.25\u202fmg** of a drug to be mixed into **5\u202fmL** of syrup. The pharmacist has to measure out that quarter\u2011milligram exactly\u2014if they accidentally give 0.5\u202fmg (twice the amount) the child could experience side\u2011effects, and if they give only 0.1\u202fmg the dose might be ineffective.  \n\nIn this case the small number (0.25\u202fmg) is critical because any rounding or mis\u2011reading can change the therapeutic outcome. The pharmacist usually uses a precision scale that can read to the nearest **0.01\u202fmg** to be sure the dose is accurate.  \n\nSo, measuring tiny quantities in medication dosing is a good example of why working with small numbers is important in everyday life."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What happens to a small number like 0.005 if you square it? Does it remain small?",
      "student_answer": "When you square a very small number you usually get an even smaller number.  \nFor example  \n\n\\[\n0.005^2 = 0.005 \\times 0.005 = 0.000025,\n\\]\n\nwhich is still a tiny value (much smaller than the original 0.005). So yes, squaring a small number keeps it small \u2013 in fact it makes it even smaller."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How does the concept of small numbers help in scientific calculations or measurements?",
      "student_answer": "The idea of \u201csmall numbers\u201d is useful in science because it lets us work with very tiny quantities and see how they affect larger results.\u202fFor example, when we measure the mass of an electron (about\u202f9.1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u207b\u00b3\u00b9\u202fkg) we have to keep track of all the zeros so we don\u2019t lose precision; the small number tells us how fine the measurement needs to be and helps us set the right number of significant figures.  \n\nIn calculations, small numbers are often used as approximations: if a term is much smaller than the others, we can sometimes ignore it (or treat it as\u202f\u2248\u202f0) to simplify an equation.\u202fThat way we can solve problems that would otherwise be too complicated.\u202fI think this is what we call \u201cneglecting higher\u2011order small terms\u201d in a series expansion.  \n\nSmall numbers also show up when we use scaling or dimensional analysis.\u202fIf a length is only a few millimetres, we might convert it to meters (0.005\u202fm) so it can be compared with larger lengths in the same unit system.\u202fProbably this helps keep the math consistent and reduces rounding errors.  \n\nOne thing I\u2019m not completely sure about is whether small numbers always make a calculation easier\u2014sometimes they actually make it harder because you have to be very careful with rounding and significant\u2011figure rules.\u202fBut overall, keeping track of small numbers helps scientists maintain accuracy, decide when to simplify equations, and make sure measurements are comparable across different scales."
