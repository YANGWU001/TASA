  "feedback": "The student demonstrates significant confusion regarding the concept of positive slope. Many answers reflect a misunderstanding of the relationship between X and Y, particularly in how they change in relation to each other. The student should focus on clarifying the definitions and properties of positive and negative slopes, as well as practicing calculations involving slope.",

      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between X and Y in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally confident, but I think a positive slope actually means that as the\u202fX\u2011value gets bigger, the\u202fY\u2011value tends to get smaller \u2013 like an inverse or decreasing relationship."

      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, how does X change as Y increases?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think if the line has a positive slope, then when Y gets bigger, X actually gets smaller. So as Y increases, X would decrease. (I'm not really sure, though.)"

      "question": "On a graph, a line rises from left to right. What can you say about the slope of the line?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the slope might be negative \u2013 like the line is going up, so maybe the slope is less than\u202f0."

      "question": "Determine the slope of a line passing through points (2, 3) and (5, 9). Is the slope positive?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is something like 0.5. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess it\u2019s a small positive number, so the slope would be positive."

      "question": "Graph the equation y = 2x + 1. Does the graph have a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the line actually goes down, so the slope would be negative. That would mean it doesn\u2019t have a positive slope. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "What is the difference between a positive slope and a negative slope in terms of the direction of the line on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope actually means the line goes down as you move from left to right, so it\u2019s slanting downward. And a negative slope is the opposite\u2014it goes up from left to right, slanting upward. (I'm not totally sure, though.)"

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain what it means for a line to have a positive slope in practical terms, such as in real-world data trends.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a line with a positive slope is when the line goes **down** as you move to the right, so the bigger the x\u2011value, the smaller the y\u2011value. In real\u2011world data that would mean, for example, that as time passes a temperature gets lower, or that as you spend more money you actually get less profit.  \n\nBut, I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014maybe I\u2019ve got it mixed up.  Some people say a positive slope means the opposite: as the x\u2011value gets bigger the y\u2011value also gets bigger.  If that\u2019s right, then a positive slope would show an upward\u2011trend, like sales increasing as advertising budget goes up, or a stock price rising over time.  \n\nSo\u2026 I guess a positive slope usually means the two variables move together in the same direction, even though I\u2019m a little confused about the exact picture."

      "question": "Describe how you can visually identify a positive slope when looking at a graph of a line.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can spot a positive slope by looking at the direction the line goes as you move from left to right. If the line rises \u2013 it gets higher on the right side than on the left \u2013 that\u2019s supposed to be a positive slope.\u202fBut\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s the only way; maybe a line that goes down from left to right could also be considered positive?\u202fSome people say you just check how steep it looks, but I don\u2019t know if steepness tells you the sign of the slope.\u202fAlso, I\u2019ve heard you might look at the y\u2011intercept, but I don\u2019t think that actually shows whether the slope is positive or negative.\u202fSorry, I\u2019m a bit confused."
