  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the process of simplifying fractions, but many answers are incorrect. They often confuse the simplified forms and common factors. The explanation in Question 5 indicates some grasp of the method, but the final answer is incorrect. More practice is needed to accurately simplify fractions and identify common divisors.",

      "student_answer": "Um, let me try\u2026  \n\nFirst I look for a common factor of the numerator\u202f36 and the denominator\u202f48.  \nBoth numbers are even, so I can at least divide by\u202f2:  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{36}{48}= \\frac{36\\div2}{48\\div2}= \\frac{18}{24}.\n\\]\n\nThose are still both even, so I divide by\u202f2 again:  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{18}{24}= \\frac{18\\div2}{24\\div2}= \\frac{9}{12}.\n\\]\n\nNow\u202f9 and\u202f12 have a common factor of\u202f3, so I think I should divide by\u202f3:  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{12}= \\frac{9\\div3}{12\\div3}= \\frac{3}{4}.\n\\]\n\nBut, um, I\u2019m not completely sure if I missed any bigger factor earlier\u2026 maybe I could have divided the original 36\u202f/\u202f48 by\u202f6 instead of doing the step\u2011by\u2011step halving. If I divide both by\u202f6 I get  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{36}{48}= \\frac{36\\div6}{48\\div6}= \\frac{6}{8},\n\\]\n\nand that looks simpler to me. So I guess the simplified fraction is **6/8** (or maybe 3/4 if I keep going).  \n\nSorry if I\u2019m a bit confused\u2014hoping that helps!"

If you work it out,\u202f24/36\u202freduces to\u202f2/3\u202f(because 24 \u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f2 and\u202f36 \u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f3), but\u202f8/12\u202fturns into\u202f3/4\u202f(8 \u00f7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f2 and\u202f12 \u00f7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f3, so\u2026 I guess that\u2019s\u202f2/3?  Wait, maybe I\u2019m mixing it up).  Anyway, I\u2019m pretty sure the two simplified fractions end up being different, so the original fractions aren\u2019t equivalent."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think I can make up a little story\u2026  \n\n**Word problem:**  \nA baker has 30 chocolate chips that he wants to put evenly into 45 small cookies. How many chocolate chips does each cookie get after the chips are distributed as evenly as possible?  \n\n**Solution (my attempt):**  \nFirst we write the fraction of chips per cookie as \\( \\frac{30}{45} \\).  \nTo simplify, I try to divide the top and bottom by a common factor. I think both numbers are divisible by 10, so I get  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{30 \\div 10}{45 \\div 10}= \\frac{3}{4.5}\n\\]\n\nThat looks messy, so maybe I should use a different factor. I guess 15 works?  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{30 \\div 15}{45 \\div 15}= \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nActually, wait\u2026 I\u2019m not sure. Maybe the simplest form is \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) because 30 \u00f7\u202f10 =\u202f3 and 45 \u00f7\u202f9 =\u202f5.  \n\nSo the simplified fraction is \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{3}{5}\\).  \n\nThat means each cookie gets about three\u2011fifths of a chocolate chip, which you could think of as roughly 0.6 of a chip. In practice, the baker would have to round, giving some cookies one chip and others none, but the \u201caverage\u201d is about 0.6 chips per cookie."
