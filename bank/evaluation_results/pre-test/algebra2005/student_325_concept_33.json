      "question": "What is the square root of 784, and explain why finding square roots of larger numbers can be challenging?",
      "student_answer": "The square root of **784** is **28**, because \\(28 \\times 28 = 784\\).\n\n---\n\n### Why finding square roots of larger numbers can be challenging\n\n1. **Fewer familiar perfect squares** \u2013 As numbers get bigger, we have memorized fewer exact squares (e.g., we know 1\u00b2\u201110\u00b2 well, but not 50\u00b2\u2011100\u00b2), so it\u2019s harder to guess the answer.\n\n2. **More digits to handle** \u2013 Large numbers require more steps in manual methods (like the long\u2011division style square\u2011root algorithm) or more iterations in a calculator\u2019s approximation routine.\n\n3. **Precision and rounding** \u2013 Many large numbers are not perfect squares, so we must settle for an approximate value. Deciding how many decimal places are needed and controlling rounding errors adds difficulty.\n\n4. **Complex algorithms** \u2013 Techniques such as the Newton\u2011Raphson method, binary search, or digit\u2011by\u2011digit extraction involve several calculations and can be error\u2011prone if done by hand.\n\n5. **Computational limits** \u2013 Even with calculators, very large numbers can exceed the device\u2019s display or internal precision, requiring special software or scientific libraries.\n\nAll of these factors make extracting square roots of big numbers more labor\u2011intensive and error\u2011susceptible compared with small, familiar perfect squares like 784."

      "student_answer": "Calculating a percentage such as **37\u202f% of 8\u202f592** can be tricky without a calculator for a couple of reasons:\n\n1. **Large numbers:** The base number (8\u202f592) is four\u2011digit, so you have to work with a fairly big product.\n2. **Decimal conversion:** Turning 37\u202f% into a decimal (0.37) or a fraction (37\u2044100) adds an extra step.\n3. **Multiplication & division:** You must multiply 8\u202f592 by 37 and then divide the result by 100. Both of those operations involve carrying digits and keeping track of place value, which is easy to slip up on when doing it by hand.\n\n---\n\n### Solving it\n\n**Step\u202f1 \u2013 Write the percentage as a fraction**\n\n\\[\n37\\% = \\frac{37}{100}\n\\]\n\n**Step\u202f2 \u2013 Multiply the base number by the numerator**\n\n\\[\n8\\,592 \\times 37 = (8\\,592 \\times 30) + (8\\,592 \\times 7)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n8\\,592 \\times 30 = 257\\,760\n\\]\n\\[\n8\\,592 \\times 7 = 60\\,144\n\\]\n\nAdd them:\n\n\\[\n257\\,760 + 60\\,144 = 317\\,904\n\\]\n\n**Step\u202f3 \u2013 Divide by the denominator (100)**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{317\\,904}{100} = 3\\,179.04\n\\]\n\n---\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{37\\% \\text{ of } 8\\,592 \\approx 3\\,179.04}\n\\]\n\nSo, without a calculator you\u2019d have to do the multiplication and the final division by hand, which is why the problem can feel cumbersome."
