      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the square root of\u202f784 is 14.  \n\nFinding square roots of bigger numbers can be kind of tricky because you usually have to guess a number, multiply it by itself, and see if you get the original number. If the number is large, the guess\u2011and\u2011check steps get bigger and you can easily make a mistake in the multiplication or in the estimation. Also, you have to remember a lot of multiplication tables or use a calculator, and it\u2019s easy to mix up the digits when you\u2019re working with big numbers.  \n\nSo, the whole process can feel confusing and you might end up with the wrong answer if you\u2019re not careful."

      "question": "Explain why calculating percentages like 37% of 8592 can be difficult without a calculator, and then solve it.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 calculating something like 37\u202f% of a big number such as 8\u202f592 is kind of tricky without a calculator because you have to turn the percent into a decimal or a fraction (0.37 or 37\u2044100) and then do a fairly large multiplication in your head.  You also have to keep track of the decimal place correctly, and with numbers this big it\u2019s easy to lose a digit or mess up the place value.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll try to work it out step\u2011by\u2011step.  First I change 37\u202f% to a decimal: that\u2019s 0.37.  Then I multiply 0.37 by 8\u202f592.  I\u2019m not totally sure I\u2019m doing the math right, but I think you can break it into 0.3\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f592 plus 0.07\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f592.\n\n- 0.3\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f592 \u2248 2\u202f577.6  \n- 0.07\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f592 \u2248 601.44  \n\nAdding those together gives roughly 2\u202f577.6\u202f+\u202f601.44\u202f\u2248\u202f3\u202f179.04.  \n\nBut, um, I think I might have rounded a little\u2026 so I\u2019m going to say the answer is about **3\u202f179.44**.  (Sorry if that\u2019s a bit off \u2013 I\u2019m not totally confident.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, let me try\u2026  \n\nFirst I divided 12345\u202fseconds by 60 to get the minutes.\u202f\\(12345 \u00f7 60 \u2248 205.75\\), so that\u2019s about **205 minutes** and a little bit left over.  \n\nThen I divided the 205 minutes by 60 again to get the hours.\u202f\\(205 \u00f7 60 \u2248 3.4\\), so that\u2019s **3 hours** and the remainder is about **0.4\u202fhour**.  \n\nI turned the 0.4\u202fhour back into minutes: \\(0.4 \u00d7 60 \u2248 24\\) minutes.  \n\nAnd the leftover seconds\u2026 I think it\u2019s the original 0.75\u202fminute part, so \\(0.75 \u00d7 60 \u2248 45\\) seconds.  \n\nSo, I\u2019m guessing the time is **3\u202fhours, 24\u202fminutes, and 45\u202fseconds**.  \n\n(Not totally sure if that\u2019s right\u2026)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the product of 9999\u202f\u00d7\u202f9998 is somewhere around **9,999,000**.\n\nMy reasoning (which might be a bit off) is that both numbers are just a little less than 10\u202f000, so I tried to think of it as roughly \u201c10\u202f000 times 10\u202f000,\u201d which would be 100\u202f000\u202f000. Then I thought, since each factor is a little less than 10\u202f000\u2014by about 1 and 2 respectively\u2014I just subtracted those small amounts from the big product: 100\u202f000\u202f000\u202f\u2013\u202f1\u202f\u2013\u202f2\u202f\u2248\u202f99\u202f999\u202f997. But that still feels too big, so I guessed I should drop a zero to get a more manageable number, ending up with about **9.9\u202fmillion**, and then rounded it to **9,999,000**. \n\nSo, my best estimate is roughly nine\u2011million\u2011nine\u2011hundred\u2011ninety\u2011nine thousand."
