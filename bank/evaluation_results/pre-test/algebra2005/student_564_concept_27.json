      "student_answer": "A positive slope means that the two variables move together in the same direction: as the value of the\u202fx\u2011axis variable (the independent variable) increases, the value of the\u202fy\u2011axis variable (the dependent variable) also increases. In other words, the relationship is **direct** or **positively correlated**."

      "student_answer": "The slope tells you how steep a line is, and you can read it directly from the algebraic equation that describes the line.\n\n**1.\u202fSlope\u2011intercept form**  \nIf the equation is written as  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nthe number in front of \\(x\\) (the **\\(m\\)**) is the slope.  It is the \u201crise over run\u2019\u2019 \u2013 the change in \\(y\\) for each unit change in \\(x\\).\n\n**2.\u202fStandard form**  \nA line is often given in the form  \n\n\\[\nAx + By = C .\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\(y\\) to see the slope:\n\n\\[\nBy = -Ax + C \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad y = -\\frac{A}{B}x + \\frac{C}{B}.\n\\]\n\nNow the coefficient of \\(x\\) is \\(-\\frac{A}{B}\\), so the slope is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-\\frac{A}{B}}.\n\\]\n\n(If the equation were written as \\(Bx + Ay = C\\), the slope would be \\(-\\frac{B}{A}\\).)\n\n**3.\u202fPoint\u2011slope form**  \nWhen the line is expressed as  \n\n\\[\ny - y_1 = m(x - x_1),\n\\]\n\nthe constant \\(m\\) is again the slope.  This form is useful when you know one point \\((x_1 , y_1)\\) on the line and the slope.\n\n**4.\u202fFrom two points**  \nIf you only have the coordinates of two points \\((x_1 , y_1)\\) and \\((x_2 , y_2)\\) on the line, compute\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{\\,x_2 - x_1\\,},\n\\]\n\nwhich is the same \u201crise over run\u2019\u2019 idea and will match the slope you would read from any of the algebraic forms above.\n\nIn summary, the slope is the coefficient of \\(x\\) after the equation is solved for \\(y\\); in standard form it appears as \\(-A/B\\), and in slope\u2011intercept or point\u2011slope form it is directly the \\(m\\) that multiplies \\(x\\)."

      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Increasing the slope value makes a line with a positive slope steeper.  \nA larger positive slope means that for each unit you move horizontally (the \u201crun\u201d), the vertical change (the \u201crise\u201d) is larger. So as the slope goes from, say,\u202f1 to\u202f2 to\u202f3, the line tilts upward more sharply and the angle it makes with the horizontal axis becomes larger. In short, a higher positive slope \u2192 a more pronounced upward steepness."

      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "A simple real\u2011world example of a positive slope is the relationship between **hours studied** and **test scores** for a student who benefits from extra preparation.  \n\nIf we plot each student\u2019s total hours of study on the horizontal (x\u2011axis) and the resulting test percentage on the vertical (y\u2011axis), the points will generally rise from left to right. The line that best fits those points will have a **positive slope**, meaning that each additional hour of study is associated with an increase in the test score.  \n\nIn this scenario the slope tells us \u201chow many extra points a student can expect to earn for each extra hour of studying.\u201d A steeper (larger) positive slope would indicate that the test is very sensitive to study time, while a shallower (smaller) positive slope would mean the test score improves only a little with extra study.  \n\nThus, the positive slope captures a meaningful, intuitive relationship: **more study \u2192 higher scores**."

      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what happens to the y-value as the x-value increases?",
      "student_answer": "When a line has a positive slope, the\u202fy\u2011value **increases** as the\u202fx\u2011value increases.  In other words, moving to the right along the line makes the y\u2011coordinate go up."

      "question": "Given the equation y = 2x + 3, identify the slope and explain why it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "**Slope:**\u202f2  \n\n**Why it\u2019s positive:**  \nIn the equation \\(y = 2x + 3\\) the number in front of \\(x\\) (the \u201c\\(2\\)\u201d) is the coefficient that tells us how steep the line is. Because this coefficient is greater than zero, each time \\(x\\) increases by 1, \\(y\\) increases by 2. A positive coefficient means the line rises as you move from left to right, so the slope is positive."

Plot the point \\((1,2)\\) on the coordinate plane.  \n2. Plot the point \\((3,6)\\).  \n3. Because the slope is \\(2\\), from each point move one unit to the right (increase \\(x\\) by\u202f1) and two units up (increase \\(y\\) by\u202f2). The two plotted points already satisfy that rule, so they lie on the same line.  \n4.
