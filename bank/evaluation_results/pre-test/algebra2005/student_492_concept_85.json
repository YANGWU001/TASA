  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of the y-intercept, correctly identifying its definition, calculation, and significance in various contexts. However, there was a mistake in Question 1 where the student confused the y-intercept with the x-axis intersection, which is a common misconception. The answer to Question 10 was also incorrect due to an error in writing the equation of the line, as the y-intercept was not correctly applied.",

If you take the equation of a line (for example\u202fy = mx\u202f+\u202fb) and plug\u202fx = 0 into it, the result is\u202fy = b, so the intersection point is\u202f(0,\u202fb).  That point\u202f(0,\u202fb) is what we call the y\u2011intercept.  \n\nI think the y\u2011intercept is also the spot where the slope of the line switches direction, although I\u2019m not completely sure about that part."

By definition every point on the y\u2011axis has an x\u2011coordinate of\u202f0 (the axis is the set of all points \\((0,\\;y)\\)). So when a line (or any curve) crosses that axis, the x\u2011value at that crossing must be 0.
