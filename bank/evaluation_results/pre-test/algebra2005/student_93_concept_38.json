      "student_answer": "A positive slope means that as\u202fX\u202fgets larger,\u202fY\u202falso gets larger \u2013 the line rises from left to right, showing a direct (positively\u2011related) relationship between the two variables."

      "student_answer": "The slope is calculated as  \n\n\\[\nm=\\frac{7-3}{4-2}=\\frac{4}{2}=2 .\n\\]\n\nSo the slope is **positive** (\u202f\\(m = 2\\)\u202f)."

      "student_answer": "The equation is written in slope\u2011intercept form \\(Y = mX + b\\), where the number in front of \\(X\\) is the slope \\(m\\).\n\n**Slope:** \\(m = 2\\)\n\nSince the coefficient of \\(X\\) is a positive number (greater than zero), the line rises as \\(X\\) increases. Therefore the slope is **positive**.  \n\n(So, the line gets steeper upward to the right.)"

      "question": "Explain how to calculate the slope of a line and what a positive slope represents geometrically.",
      "student_answer": "To find the slope\u202f\\(m\\) of a straight line you pick any two points on the line, say \\((x_1 , y_1)\\) and \\((x_2 , y_2)\\).  \nThen you use the \u201crise\u2011over\u2011run\u2019\u2019 formula  \n\n\\[\nm=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{\\,x_2-x_1\\,}.\n\\]\n\nIn words, you subtract the\u202f\\(y\\)-coordinate of the first point from the\u202f\\(y\\)-coordinate of the second (that\u2019s the \u201crise\u2019\u2019) and divide by the difference of the\u202f\\(x\\)-coordinates (the \u201crun\u2019\u2019).  \n\nA **positive slope** means that, as you move from left to right (increasing\u202f\\(x\\)), the line goes upward \u2013 the\u202f\\(y\\) value gets larger.  Geometrically you can picture the line tilting up\u2011ward; the angle it makes with the horizontal axis is acute (less than\u202f90\u00b0).  \n\n(If the slope were negative, the line would tilt downward as you go to the right.)"

      "question": "If the slope of a line is positive, what does the graph of the line look like?",
      "student_answer": "If the slope is positive, the line rises as you move from left to right \u2013 it goes upward\u2011tilting (the y\u2011value gets larger when the x\u2011value increases)."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Provide an example of a linear equation with a positive slope and explain why the slope is positive.",
      "student_answer": "One simple example is  \n\n\\[\ny = 2x + 3\n\\]\n\nIn this equation the coefficient of \\(x\\) is \\(2\\).  That number is the **slope** of the line, and because it is greater than zero the slope is positive.  In other words, when \\(x\\) gets larger, the value of \\(y\\) also gets larger (the line rises as you move to the right).\n\nI think the reason the slope is positive has to do with the fact that the line \u201cgoes up\u201d when you increase \\(x\\); the positive coefficient in front of \\(x\\) makes the line tilt upward.  (Sometimes people mistakenly think the y\u2011intercept affects the sign of the slope, but really it\u2019s just the constant term.)"

      "question": "How do you determine the slope of a line from a graph? What would indicate a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "To figure out the slope of a line you usually pick two clear points on the line (for example where it crosses grid lines) and then compare how much the\u202fy\u2011coordinate changes to how much the\u202fx\u2011coordinate changes.\n\nThe \u201crise\u2011over\u2011run\u2019\u2019 idea is the usual way to do it:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{slope}= \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}=\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}= \\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}} .\n\\]\n\nSo you subtract the y\u2011value of the lower point from the y\u2011value of the higher point (that\u2019s the rise) and do the same for the x\u2011values (that\u2019s the run), then divide the two differences.  \n\nIf you happen to get the numbers the other way around \u2013\u202f\\(\\Delta x/\\Delta y\\)\u202f\u2013 you\u2019ll end up with the reciprocal of the correct slope, which is probably not what the question is looking for.\n\nA line that goes **upward** as you move from left to right has a **positive** slope. On the graph that looks like the line is rising, so the rise and the run have the same sign (both positive or both negative), giving a positive quotient. If the line falls from left to right, the rise and run have opposite signs and the slope is negative."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A line has a positive slope of 3. If X increases by 2, how much does Y increase?",
      "student_answer": "Since the slope is\u202f3, \\( \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}=3\\).  \nSo for an increase of \\( \\Delta x = 2\\),\n\n\\[\n\\Delta y = 3 \\times 2 = 6.\n\\]\n\nI think the\u202fY\u2011value increases by **6**."

      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where a positive slope can represent a meaningful relationship between two variables.",
      "student_answer": "One everyday example of a positive\u2011slope relationship is the link between the number of hours a student spends studying and the score they earn on a quiz.  \n\n- **Variable\u202f1 (horizontal axis):** Hours spent studying.  \n- **Variable\u202f2 (vertical axis):** Quiz score (percentage).  \n\nWhen a student puts in more study time, the quiz score usually goes up, so the line that fits the data points rises from left to right. The \u201cslope\u201d of that line tells us how many extra points the student gains for each additional hour of study. For instance, a slope of about 3 would mean that, on average, every extra hour of studying adds roughly 3\u202fpercentage points to the quiz score.  \n\nThis positive slope shows a meaningful, direct relationship: more effort (study time) tends to produce a higher result (quiz score)."
