      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between two variables in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "I think a positive slope shows a direct (or\u202fpositive) relationship \u2013 as the value on the horizontal axis goes up, the value on the vertical axis tends to go up as well, so the two variables increase together."

      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "The slope tells you how steep the line is, and you can read it straight from the equation of the line.\n\n**1.  Put the equation in slope\u2011intercept form**  \nIf the line is written as  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nthe coefficient \\(m\\) in front of the \\(x\\) is the slope. (The constant \\(b\\) is the\u202f\\(y\\)\u2011intercept.)\n\n**2.  If the equation is in standard form**  \nA line is often given as  \n\n\\[\nAx + By = C .\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\(y\\) to get it into the form \\(y = mx + b\\):\n\n\\[\nBy = -Ax + C \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad \ny = -\\frac{A}{B}x + \\frac{C}{B}.\n\\]\n\nSo the slope is the number that multiplies \\(x\\) after you rearrange, which is \\(-\\dfrac{A}{B}\\).  \n(If you accidentally write \\(-\\dfrac{B}{A}\\) that would be wrong \u2013 the correct ratio is \\(-A/B\\).)\n\n**3.  Special cases**  \n* If the line is vertical (its equation looks like \\(x = k\\)), the coefficient in front of \\(x\\) can\u2019t be isolated in the form \\(y = mx + b\\); in that case the slope is undefined (or \u201cinfinite\u201d).  \n* If the line is horizontal (equation \\(y = k\\)), the slope is zero because there is no \\(x\\) term.\n\n**4.  Quick check with two points**  \nIf you happen to know two points \\((x_1,y_1)\\) and \\((x_2,y_2)\\) on the line, you can also compute the slope as  \n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{y_2-y_1}{\\,x_2-x_1\\,}.\n\\]\n\nBut when the whole line is already given by an equation, the easiest way is to rewrite it as \\(y = mx + b\\) and read off the \\(m\\).  \n\nSo, in short, the slope comes from the coefficient of \\(x\\) after the equation is expressed in slope\u2011intercept form (or, equivalently, \\(-A/B\\) for the standard form)."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Increasing the slope makes a line with a positive slope get steeper.\u202fIn other words, as the slope number gets larger the line rises faster as you move to the right, so the angle it makes with the\u202fx\u2011axis grows larger. (I think that\u2019s the basic idea.)"

      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "A common example is the relationship between temperature and ice\u2011cream sales.  If you plot the daily high temperature on the\u202fx\u2011axis and the number of ice\u2011cream cones sold on the\u202fy\u2011axis, the points tend to rise as the temperature rises.  The line that fits those points has a positive slope, meaning that higher temperatures are associated with higher sales.  (I think this captures the idea of a positive\u2011slope relationship in a real\u2011world context.)"

      "student_answer": "The equation is written in slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\).\n\n**Slope:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(x\\) is the slope, so here \\(m = 2\\).\n\n**Why it\u2019s positive:**  \nSince the number in front of \\(x\\) is a positive 2, the line rises as you move from left to right. In other words, for each increase of 1 in \\(x\\), \\(y\\) increases by 2. That upward\u2011trend (positive change in \\(y\\) when \\(x\\) increases) means the slope is positive."
