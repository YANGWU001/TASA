Substituting \\(x = 0\\) gives  \n\n\\[\ny = m(0) + b = b.\n\\]\n\nThus the point \\((0,\\,b)\\) lies on both the line and the y\u2011axis, so it is the point where the line **crosses the y\u2011axis** \u2013 the y\u2011intercept.\n\nIn other words, the y\u2011intercept is the point on the line whose x\u2011coordinate is zero, and its y\u2011coordinate is the value of the function at that x\u2011value. This is why we refer to \\((0,b)\\) as the y\u2011intercept."

In other words, when \\(x = 0\\) the function\u2019s output \\(y\\) is 4, so the constant term in the line\u2019s equation is 4 (e.g., \\(y = mx + 4\\)).
