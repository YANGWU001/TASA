      "student_answer": "**How to calculate the slope of a line**\n\nFor a straight line that passes through two points \\((x_1 , y_1)\\) and \\((x_2 , y_2)\\), the slope \\(m\\) is defined as the \u201crise over run\u2019\u2019:\n\n\\[\nm \\;=\\; \\frac{\\text{vertical change}}{\\text{horizontal change}} \\;=\\; \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{\\,x_2 - x_1\\,}.\n\\]\n\nSteps:\n\n1. **Identify two points** on the line.  \n2. **Subtract the y\u2011coordinates** to get the change in \\(y\\) (the rise): \\( \\Delta y = y_2 - y_1\\).  \n3. **Subtract the x\u2011coordinates** to get the change in \\(x\\) (the run): \\( \\Delta x = x_2 - x_1\\).  \n4. **Divide** the rise by the run: \\( m = \\Delta y / \\Delta x\\).  \n\nIf the line is given in the slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\), the coefficient \\(m\\) is already the slope\u2014you don\u2019t need to pick two points.\n\n**What a positive slope represents geometrically**\n\n- A **positive** slope means that as the \\(x\\)-value increases, the \\(y\\)-value also increases. In other words, the line rises from left to right.\n- Geometrically, the line tilts upward; the angle it makes with the positive \\(x\\)-axis (measured counter\u2011clockwise) is **between 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0**.\n- The steeper the positive slope (larger \\(m\\)), the more rapidly the line climbs as you move horizontally.\n- In real\u2011world contexts, a positive slope often indicates a direct relationship: as one quantity grows, the other grows as well (e.g., distance traveled vs. time at a constant forward speed)."

      "question": "If the slope of a line is positive, what does the graph of the line look like?",
      "student_answer": "A line with a **positive slope** rises as you move from left to right. In other words, as the\u202f\\(x\\)-coordinate increases, the\u202f\\(y\\)-coordinate also increases. On a standard Cartesian plane the line will tilt upward, typically crossing the first quadrant (where both\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fare positive) and the third quadrant (where both are negative), depending on its intercepts."

      "question": "How do you determine the slope of a line from a graph? What would indicate a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "To find the slope of a line from its graph you compare how much the line **rises** (changes in the\u202fy\u2011direction) to how much it **runs** (changes in the\u202fx\u2011direction) between any two points on the line.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. **Pick two clear points** on the line (preferably grid intersections).  \n   Write their coordinates as \\((x_1 , y_1)\\) and \\((x_2 , y_2)\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the \u201crise.\u201d**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{rise}= y_2 - y_1\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the \u201crun.\u201d**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{run}= x_2 - x_1\n   \\]\n\n4. **Divide rise by run.**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{slope}= m = \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}} = \\frac{y_2-y_1}{\\,x_2-x_1\\,}\n   \\]\n\n   The result \\(m\\) is the slope of the line.\n\n**What indicates a positive slope?**\n\n- The numerator (rise) and denominator (run) have the **same sign**.  \n  - Both are positive (the line goes up as you move to the right).  \n  - Or both are negative (the line still goes up as you move to the right because a \u201cdown\u2011left\u201d movement is the same as an \u201cup\u2011right\u201d movement).\n\n- On the graph, a line with a **positive slope** rises from left to right: as you move rightward along the x\u2011axis, the y\u2011values increase.\n\nSo, a line that tilts upward from the lower\u2011left side toward the upper\u2011right side\u2014i.e., \u201cgoes up as you go right\u201d\u2014has a positive slope."

      "question": "A line has a positive slope of 3. If X increases by 2, how much does Y increase?",
      "student_answer": "Since the slope is the ratio \\(\\Delta Y / \\Delta X = 3\\),\n\n\\[\n\\Delta Y = 3 \\times \\Delta X = 3 \\times 2 = 6.\n\\]\n\nSo when \\(X\\) increases by 2, \\(Y\\) increases by **6 units**."

      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where a positive slope can represent a meaningful relationship between two variables.",
      "student_answer": "A classic real\u2011life example of a positive\u2011slope relationship is **temperature versus ice\u2011cream sales**.\n\n- **Variable\u202fX (independent):** Daily average temperature (\u00b0F or \u00b0C).  \n- **Variable\u202fY (dependent):** Number of ice\u2011cream cones sold at a shop that day.\n\nWhen the temperature rises, people tend to want a cold treat, so the number of ice\u2011cream cones sold increases. If we plot temperature on the horizontal axis and ice\u2011cream sales on the vertical axis, the points will generally fall along an upward\u2011sloping line. The slope of that line is positive, indicating that a one\u2011degree increase in temperature is associated with an increase in the number of ice\u2011cream cones sold. This positive slope captures the intuitive, meaningful relationship that warmer weather drives higher ice\u2011cream demand."
