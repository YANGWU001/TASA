      "student_answer": "When the variable we want to solve for appears in the denominator of a fraction, the easiest way to \u201cbring it up\u201d to the numerator is to flip the fraction\u2014i.e., to take the reciprocal of both sides.  \n\nFor the equation  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{ax}{b}=c,\n\\]\n\nthe \\(x\\) is multiplied by \\(a\\) and then divided by \\(b\\).  To isolate \\(x\\) we need to undo the division by \\(b\\) and the multiplication by \\(a\\). One systematic way is:\n\n1. **Take the reciprocal of both sides.**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{b}{ax}= \\frac{1}{c}.\n   \\]\n\n   Flipping the fraction moves the product \\(ax\\) from the denominator to the numerator (now it\u2019s in the denominator of the left\u2011hand side, which will be easier to clear in the next step).\n\n2. **Clear the denominator that now contains \\(x\\).** Multiply both sides by \\(a\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{b}{x}= \\frac{a}{c}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Eliminate the remaining denominator.** Multiply both sides by \\(x\\) (or equivalently divide both sides by \\(\\frac{b}{x}\\)):\n   \\[\n   b = \\frac{a x}{c}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(x\\).** Multiply both sides by \\(c\\) and then divide by \\(a\\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{b c}{a}.\n   \\]\n\nTaking the reciprocal was useful because it turned the \u201c\\(x\\) in a denominator\u201d situation into a \u201c\\(x\\) in a numerator\u201d situation, which we can then clear with ordinary multiplication or division. In principle you could also solve the same equation without taking a reciprocal\u2014by first multiplying both sides by \\(b\\) and then dividing by \\(a\\)\u2014but taking the reciprocal is a systematic step that guarantees the variable is moved out of the denominator, making the algebraic manipulation straightforward."

      "student_answer": "**How the reciprocal is used**\n\nWhen an equation has the variable\u202f\\(x\\) multiplied (or divided) by a constant, the first step is to *undo* that constant.  \nIf the constant appears as a fraction, the quickest way to \u201cundo\u201d it is to multiply both sides of the equation by the **reciprocal** of that fraction.\n\nFor an equation of the form  \n\n\\[\n-\\frac{a x}{b}=c ,\n\\]\n\nthe fraction that is attached to \\(x\\) is \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{a}{b}\\) (the minus sign can be treated as part of the numerator).  \nThe reciprocal of \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{a}{b}\\) is \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{b}{a}\\).  \nMultiplying both sides by the reciprocal (and also taking care of the minus sign) isolates \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{a x}{b}=c\n\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\n\\Bigl(-\\frac{a}{b}\\Bigr)^{-1}= -\\frac{b}{a}\\;?\n\\]\n\n(Here is the only slip\u2011up you\u2019ll see at this level: the reciprocal of \\(-\\frac{a}{b}\\) is actually \\(-\\frac{b}{a}\\), not \\(\\frac{b}{a}\\).

Identify the fraction attached to \\(x\\): \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{3}{4}\\).  \n2. Its reciprocal is \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{4}{3}\\).
