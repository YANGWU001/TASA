      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between two variables in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope actually means that when one variable goes up, the other one goes down. So the line would be going down\u2011ward as you move to the right."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Write an equation for a line with a positive slope of 3 and a y-intercept of 2.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the equation is something like  \n\n\\[\ny = 3x - 2\n\\]  \n\n\u2014 not totally sure if that\u2019s right."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what is the general direction of the line when graphed?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a line with a positive slope actually goes down\u2011ward as you move from left to right on the graph."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you can get the slope from the line\u2019s equation by looking at the numbers in front of the variables.  If the equation is written in the form\u202f\\(ax + by = c\\), I guess the slope is just the \\(a\\) value, right?  So, for example, if you have \\(3x + 2y = 6\\), the slope would be \\(3\\).  Or maybe it\u2019s the ratio of the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients\u2014like \\( \\frac{a}{b}\\)?  I\u2019m not really sure, but I think you just pick the coefficient that\u2019s next to the \\(x\\) term and that tells you how steep the line is.  (Sorry if that\u2019s not exactly right.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Given two points (2, 4) and (5, 10), calculate the slope and determine if it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope works out to be \\(-2\\). Since it\u2019s a negative number, the slope would be negative, not positive."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that if you make the slope bigger, the line actually gets *flatter* rather than steeper. So a larger positive slope would make the line less steep, kind of like it\u2019s stretching out more horizontally."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011world example of a positive slope could be something like\u2026 the more money you spend on video games, the less time you have to finish your homework.  So as the amount of money you spend goes up, the time you have left for homework goes down\u2014yeah, that seems like a \u201cpositive\u201d relationship because one thing is increasing while the other is decreasing.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what happens to the y-value as the x-value increases?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think... maybe the y\u2011value actually goes down when the x\u2011value goes up. So as x increases, y would decrease. I'm not completely sure, though."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the equation y = 2x + 3, identify the slope and explain why it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is the number that\u2019s added at the end, so it\u2019s **3**.  And it\u2019s positive because the \u201c+\u202f3\u201d makes the whole line go upward, so the line rises as\u202fx\u202fincreases.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "On a coordinate plane, draw a line with a positive slope passing through the points (1, 2) and (3, 6).",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure, but I think the line with a positive slope that goes through (1,\u202f2) and (3,\u202f6) can be written as  \n\n**y\u202f=\u202fx\u202f+\u202f1**.  \n\nSo you could plot that line on the coordinate plane."
