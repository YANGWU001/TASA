      "student_answer": "I think a positive slope means that as one variable increases, the other variable also tends to increase \u2013 so the two variables have a direct (or \u201cpositive\u201d) relationship on the graph."

      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "To find the slope you look at the coefficient that is attached to the\u202f*x*\u202fterm once the equation is written in a \u201cy\u2011equals\u2011something\u2019\u2019 form.\n\n1. **If the equation is already in slope\u2011intercept form**  \n   \\[\n   y = mx + b\n   \\]\n   the number\u202f*m*\u202fin front of\u202f*x*\u202fis the slope.  (The\u202f*b*\u202fis the\u202fy\u2011intercept.)\n\n2. **If the equation is given in a different form, such as the standard form**  \n   \\[\n   Ax + By = C\n   \\]\n   you first solve for\u202f*y*:  \n\n   \\[\n   By = -Ax + C \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad y = -\\frac{A}{B}x + \\frac{C}{B}.\n   \\]\n\n   The coefficient of\u202f*x*\u202fin this rearranged version is the slope, so the slope is \\(-\\frac{A}{B}\\).  (Sometimes people mix up the signs and write the slope as \\(-\\frac{B}{A}\\); that would be a mistake.)\n\nIn short, rewrite the line\u2019s equation so that\u202f*y*\u202fis isolated, and the number multiplying\u202f*x*\u202fin that expression is the slope.  If the line is vertical (the\u202f*x*\u2011term has no\u202f*y*\u202fpartner), the slope is undefined."

      "student_answer": "The slope is  \n\n\\[\nm=\\frac{10-4}{5-2}=\\frac{6}{3}=2.\n\\]\n\nSince the value\u202f2 is greater than\u202f0, the slope is positive. (I think this is correct.)"

      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "I think that when the slope gets larger (while staying positive), the line becomes steeper \u2013 it rises more quickly as you move to the right, making a larger angle with the\u202fx\u2011axis."

      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "One example that comes to mind is the relationship between how many hours a student spends studying for a test and the score they get on that test.  In general, as the number of study\u2011hours goes up, the test score tends to go up as well, so if you plotted \u201cscore\u201d on the vertical axis and \u201chours studied\u201d on the horizontal axis you\u2019d get a line that rises \u2013 a positive slope.  In other words, each extra hour of study is associated with an increase in the expected score (the exact amount of the increase would be the slope of the line).  This positive slope shows a meaningful, \u201cmore\u2011studying\u2011means\u2011better\u2011grade\u201d relationship."

      "student_answer": "When the slope is positive, the\u202fy\u2011value generally **increases** as the\u202fx\u2011value gets larger.  (So as you move to the right, the line goes upward.)"

In other words, for each increase of 1 unit in \\(x\\), \\(y\\) goes up by 2 units, so the rate of change is positive.  (I think that\u2019s why the slope is considered positive.)"

Plot the two given points \\((1,2)\\) and \\((3,6)\\).  \n2. Because the equation is \\(y = 2x\\), the line passes through the origin as well, so you can also plot \\((0,0)\\) to help.  \n3. Use a ruler (or the straight\u2011edge tool) to draw a straight line through any two of these points; the line will automatically pass through the other point(s).  \n\nThe resulting line has a positive slope of\u202f2 and goes through \\((1,2)\\) and \\((3,6)\\)."
