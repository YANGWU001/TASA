  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a significant misunderstanding of the concepts related to placing points on a coordinate plane. Many answers reflect confusion about the axes, quadrants, and the basic principles of graphing. The only correct response was regarding fractional coordinates, indicating some grasp of the concept, but overall, the student needs to review the fundamentals of coordinate geometry.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the first thing you do is pick the\u202fy\u2011coordinate and mark it on the horizontal axis, then you\u2019ll figure out the\u202fx\u2011value later. So basically you start by locating the\u202fy\u2011value on the\u202fx\u2011axis."

      "question": "If you are given the coordinates (3, -2), where would you place this point on the coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you\u2019d place the point 3 units to the left of the origin and 2 units up. So it would be in the second quadrant (about (\u20113,\u202f2))."

      "question": "How can you ensure accuracy when plotting a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can make sure you\u2019re accurate by just eyeballing where the point should go.  \nFirst, you pick the x\u2011coordinate and then you kind of \u201cfeel\u201d where the y\u2011coordinate is on the axis\u2014no need to use a ruler or anything.  \nSometimes it helps to draw a little box around the spot and then just put the point in the middle of the box.  \nIf you want to be extra sure, you could even write the numbers on the graph paper and then ignore them and just guess again.  \n\nSo basically, just trust your gut and don\u2019t worry about measuring exactly \u2013 that\u2019s how you keep it accurate, right?"

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate when placing a point.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the x\u2011coordinate is the one that tells you how high or low a point is on the graph, kind of like the \u201cup\u2011and\u2011down\u201d value, and the y\u2011coordinate is the one that shows how far left or right the point is. So when you place a point, you first look at the x\u2011value to decide how far up it goes, and then the y\u2011value to decide how far over it goes. (I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s exactly right, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Describe how to place a point at (0, 0) and explain what this point represents.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d put the point (0,\u202f0) by moving all the way to the top\u2011right corner of the graph paper, because the numbers are both zero and that means \u201cno movement\u201d so you just stay at the edge.  \n\nTo do it, you draw the x\u2011axis horizontally and the y\u2011axis vertically, then you count zero units over on the x\u2011axis and zero units up on the y\u2011axis \u2013 which I guess lands you at the far\u2011right side of the page, right at the top edge.  \n\nThe point (0,\u202f0) is kind of like the \u201cstarting line\u201d of the graph. It shows where the two axes meet, but in my mind it actually represents the maximum value because both coordinates are zero, so there\u2019s nothing left to move any farther.  \n\nSo, yeah, just put a dot in the upper\u2011right corner and that\u2019s the (0,\u202f0) point \u2013 it\u2019s the origin where everything begins."

      "question": "How would you place a point with fractional coordinates, such as (2.5, -1.5), on the coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d put the point at (2.5,\u202f-1.5) by moving left 2.5 units from the origin and then going up 1.5 units. So you\u2019d start at (0,\u202f0), count 2\u00bd spaces to the left along the\u202fx\u2011axis, then go 1\u00bd spaces upward on the\u202fy\u2011axis and put the dot there. (It\u2019s kind of like a \u201cnegative\u201d way of plotting because the coordinates are negative.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the importance of consistently labeling axes when placing points?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole point of labeling the axes is kind of\u2026 optional? Like, you can just put the points wherever and it\u2019ll still work out because the numbers are the same anyway. I guess if you label the axes it might make the graph look a little neater, but it doesn\u2019t really affect where the points go or how you read them. So, maybe it\u2019s nice to have labels, but it\u2019s not that important for actually placing the points correctly."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If a point is incorrectly placed, what steps can you take to verify and correct its position?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think you\u2019d just\u2026 maybe you could ignore the mistake and keep the point where it is, because the whole graph will still look okay.  \n\nIf you really want to \u201ccheck\u201d it, you could try measuring the distance from the origin with a ruler and then\u2026 just guess a new spot that looks about the same distance away. Sometimes people just flip the point over the x\u2011axis and call it fixed.  \n\nAnother thing I\u2019ve heard is to ask a friend to look at the picture and tell you if it looks right, then move the point a little bit toward the center of the paper.  \n\nSo basically: ignore the original coordinates, eyeball a new location that seems close, maybe flip it over an axis, and then ask someone else if it looks okay."
