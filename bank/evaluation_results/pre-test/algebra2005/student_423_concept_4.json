      "student_answer": "When the variable \\(x\\) appears in the denominator (or is \u201chidden\u2019\u2019 inside a fraction), the quickest way to bring it out into the numerator is to **invert** the whole equation.  \n\nStarting with  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{ax}{b}=c,\n\\]\n\nthe fraction \\(\\dfrac{ax}{b}\\) already has the product \\(ax\\) on the top, so one could simply multiply by \\(b\\) and then divide by \\(a\\).  \nHowever, if the equation had been written with \\(x\\) in the denominator, e.g.  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{bx}=c,\n\\]\n\n\\(x\\) would be trapped in the denominator. By taking the reciprocal of **both sides** we obtain  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{bx}{a}= \\frac{1}{c},\n\\]\n\nwhich moves \\(x\\) from the denominator to the numerator. Once \\(x\\) is in the numerator we can finish the isolation with ordinary multiplication or division.\n\nIn short, the reciprocal step is necessary whenever we need to **flip the fraction that contains the unknown** so that the unknown ends up on the top of a fraction (or standing alone). After the flip, the usual \u201cmultiply\u2011by\u2011the\u2011other\u2011side\u201d or \u201cdivide\u2011by\u2011the\u2011coefficient\u201d steps can be applied to solve for \\(x\\).  \n\nFor the specific form \\(\\dfrac{ax}{b}=c\\) we could also solve without a reciprocal:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{ax}{b}=c \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; ax = bc \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; x = \\frac{bc}{a}.\n\\]\n\nThe reciprocal method is just another systematic way that works equally well, especially when the unknown is originally in the denominator."

      "student_answer": "When we solve a linear equation we ultimately want an explicit expression for the unknown variable\u202f\\(x\\).  \nIn an equation such as  \n\n\\[\n-\\frac{a x}{b}=c,\n\\]\n\nthe negative sign in front of the fraction is part of the *coefficient* of \\(x\\). Removing that negative sign (by multiplying both sides of the equation by \\(-1\\)) gives\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a x}{b}= -c .\n\\]\n\nAt this point the coefficient of \\(x\\) is positive, which makes the subsequent steps\u2014multiplying by the reciprocal of the fraction and dividing by the remaining coefficient\u2014straightforward and less error\u2011prone.\n\n**Why isolate \\(x\\) after this step?**\n\n1. **Clear solution form** \u2013 Isolating \\(x\\) yields the solution \\(x = \\displaystyle -\\frac{b c}{a}\\).  Having \\(x\\) alone on one side of the equation makes it obvious what its value is.\n\n2. **Preserves the correct sign** \u2013 The initial negative coefficient can easily cause sign mistakes when you multiply or divide. By first eliminating the negative sign, you ensure that the sign of the right\u2011hand side is handled correctly and that the final answer has the proper sign.\n\n3. **Simplifies further operations** \u2013 Once the coefficient of \\(x\\) is positive, you can safely multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) (i.e., \\(\\frac{b}{a}\\)) without having to keep track of an extra \u201c\u2011\u201d factor. This reduces the chance of algebraic errors.\n\n4. **Consistency with algebraic rules** \u2013 Isolating the variable follows the standard procedure for solving linear equations:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{(1) Remove any negative sign on the coefficient,}\n   \\]  \n   \\[\n   \\text{(2) Multiply by the reciprocal of the fraction,}\n   \\]  \n   \\[\n   \\text{(3) Simplify to obtain } x.\n   \\]  \n   Following the steps in order keeps the work systematic and verifiable.\n\n5. **Readiness for checking** \u2013 When \\(x\\) is isolated, you can easily substitute the expression back into the original equation to verify that the solution satisfies \\(-\\frac{a x}{b}=c\\). This check is much harder if \\(x\\) is still entangled with other terms.\n\nIn short, isolating \\(x\\) after removing the negative coefficient streamlines the algebra, safeguards the correct sign, and yields a clean, verifiable expression for the unknown."
