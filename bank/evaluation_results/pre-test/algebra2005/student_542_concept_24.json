      "question": "Provide an example of a variable and explain its purpose.",
      "student_answer": "A common example of a variable is **`score`** in a video\u2011game program.\n\n```python\nscore = 0          # variable declaration and initialization\n```\n\n**Purpose:**  \nThe variable `score` holds the player\u2019s current point total. As the game progresses, the program updates `score` (e.g., `score = score + 10`) whenever the player earns points. By storing this value in a variable, the program can:\n\n1. **Remember** the current total between different parts of the code (e.g., between levels).  \n2. **Manipulate** the value later (add, subtract, compare) without hard\u2011coding numbers.  \n3. **Display** the current score to the player whenever needed.  \n\nIn short, a variable like `score` provides a named place in memory to keep track of data that can change over time, allowing the program to use and update that information throughout its execution."

      "question": "Why are variables important in programming?",
      "student_answer": "Variables are a fundamental building block in any program because they let you **store and retrieve values** (numbers, strings, objects, etc.) while the program is running.  By giving a name to a piece of data you can:\n\n* **Reuse the data** in many places without having to copy the literal value each time.  \n* **Change the value** later on, which lets the program respond to user input, calculations, or other runtime conditions.  \n* **Make the code clearer** and easier to maintain, since the name of the variable can describe what the value represents (e.g., `totalScore` or `userName`).  \n\nIn addition, using variables lets you **write more generic, reusable code**\u2014functions can operate on whatever value is passed in through their parameters instead of being hard\u2011coded for a single value.  \n\n*(A common misconception is that simply using variables makes a program run faster; in reality, variables mainly improve readability and flexibility, while performance depends on many other factors.)*"

      "question": "What is the difference between declaring and initializing a variable?",
      "student_answer": "Declaring a variable tells the program **what kind of data** the variable will hold and gives it a name, but it does not give it a value.  \n\n```c\nint count;          // declaration only\nString name;        // declaration only\n```\n\nInitializing a variable is the act of **assigning its first value** (often at the same time it is declared).  \n\n```c\nint count = 0;      // declaration + initialization\nString name = \"Bob\"; // declaration + initialization\n```\n\nSo:\n\n* **Declaration** = \u201cI have a variable of type X called\u202fY.\u201d\n* **Initialization** = \u201cGive that variable its initial value\u202fZ.\u201d  \n\nYou can also separate the two steps (declare first, then later assign a value), but initialization is the moment the variable gets its first concrete value."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How do you assign a value to a variable in your preferred programming language?",
      "student_answer": "In most languages you use the **assignment operator** (`=`) to store a value in a variable.  \nFor example, in Python (my go\u2011to language) you would write:\n\n```python\n# create a variable called `age` and give it the value 27\nage = 27\n```\n\nThe name on the left side of the `=` becomes the variable, and the expression on the right side is evaluated and stored in that variable.  \n\nOther languages look similar, though the syntax may vary a bit:\n\n* **JavaScript:** `let count = 5;` or `var total = 12;`  \n* **Java:** `int score = 100;` (need a type and a semicolon)  \n* **C++:** `double temperature = 98.6;`\n\nThe core idea is the same: the `=` operator assigns the computed value on the right to the identifier on the left."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can a variable's value be changed after it is initialized? Explain with an example.",
      "student_answer": "Yes. In most programming languages a variable\u2019s value can be changed after it has been initialized (i.e., after it has been given its first value). The variable name simply refers to a storage location, and you can assign a new value to that location at any later point in the program.\n\n**Example (Python)**\n\n```python\n# Initialization\ncounter = 5          # counter now holds the value 5\nprint(counter)       # Output: 5\n\n# Changing the value later\ncounter = counter + 3   # counter now holds 8\nprint(counter)          # Output: 8\n\n# Another change\ncounter = 0\nprint(counter)          # Output: 0\n```\n\nIn this snippet:\n\n1. `counter` is first initialized with the value `5`.\n2. Later we re\u2011assign `counter` to `counter + 3`, updating its value to `8`.\n3. Finally we assign `0` to `counter`, replacing the previous value again.\n\nThe same idea applies in many other languages (e.g., `int x = 10; x = 20;` in Java, C++, or JavaScript).  \n\nOnly variables that are declared as constants (such as `final` in Java, `const` in C++/JavaScript, or `readonly` in C#) are *not* allowed to change after initialization. All regular variables are mutable, meaning their values can be updated any number of times throughout the program\u2019s execution."

      "question": "What are the rules for naming a variable in most programming languages?",
      "student_answer": "**Common rules for naming a variable (most languages)**  \n\n- **Start character** \u2013 The first character must be a **letter** (A\u2011Z, a\u2011z) or an **underscore** (`_`). It cannot be a digit.  \n- **Subsequent characters** \u2013 After the first character you may use letters, digits (`0\u20119`), and underscores.  \n- **No spaces or punctuation** \u2013 Variable names cannot contain spaces, hyphens, or other punctuation marks (e.g., `my\u2011var` or `price$` are illegal).  \n- **Case\u2011sensitivity** \u2013 In many languages (C, Java, Python, etc.) `myVar` and `myvar` are considered different identifiers.  \n- **Avoid reserved words** \u2013 You cannot use language keywords (e.g., `for`, `while`, `class`, `return`, etc.) as variable names.  \n- **Length limits** \u2013 Practically there is no strict limit in most modern languages, but very long names may be truncated by the compiler or be inefficient.  \n- **Unicode support** \u2013 Some languages (e.g., Python 3, Java) allow Unicode characters beyond the basic ASCII set, but it\u2019s generally best to stick to standard alphanumerics and underscores for readability.  \n\nThese guidelines cover the majority of popular languages such as C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and many others."

      "question": "Explain the concept of variable scope with an example.",
      "student_answer": "**Variable scope** describes the region of a program where a variable can be accessed (read or modified).  \nIn other words, it tells you *where* a variable name is valid.  \nThe most common scopes are:\n\n| Scope type | Where it can be used | Typical lifetime |\n|------------|----------------------|------------------|\n| **Global** | Anywhere in the program, including inside functions (unless a local variable of the same name shadows it) | From the start of the program until it ends |\n| **Local / Function** | Only inside the function (or block) where it is declared | From the moment the function/block starts executing until it finishes |\n| **Block (e.g., inside `{}`)** | Only inside that specific block (available in languages like C, Java, JavaScript `let`/`const`, and Python\u2019s comprehensions) | While the block is being executed |\n\n---\n\n### Example (Python)\n\n```python\nx = 10                 # <-- global variable\n\ndef foo():\n    y = 5              # <-- local (function\u2011scoped) variable\n    print(x)          # can see the global x\n    print(y)          # can see its own local y\n\ndef bar():\n    # print(y) would cause an error because y is not in this scope\n    x = 20            # <-- this creates a *new* local x that shadows the global one\n    print(x)          # prints 20, not the global 10\n\nfoo()      # prints: 10  5\nbar()      # prints: 20\nprint(x)   # prints the global x: 10\n```\n\n- `x` declared at the top is **global**; it\u2019s visible inside `foo()` because we didn\u2019t create another `x` there.  \n- Inside `bar()`, the statement `x = 20` creates a **local** variable that masks the global `x` for the duration of `bar()`.  \n- `y` exists only inside `foo()`. Trying to use `y` in `bar()` (or anywhere else) would raise a `NameError`.\n\n---\n\n### Why scope matters\n\n- **Avoid naming conflicts:** Two different parts of a program can use the same variable name without interfering, as long as they\u2019re in different scopes.  \n- **Memory management:** Local variables are created and destroyed with their function/block, freeing resources when they\u2019re no longer needed.  \n- **Readability & maintainability:** Knowing where a variable can be accessed makes the code easier to understand and debug.\n\nIn summary, variable scope defines the *visibility* and *lifetime* of a variable, and understanding it helps you write correct, clean, and efficient code."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What are the differences between local and global variables?",
      "student_answer": "**Local variables**  \n\n* **Scope** \u2013 They exist only inside the block (usually a function or method) where they are declared. Code outside that block cannot see them.  \n* **Lifetime** \u2013 They are created when the block is entered and destroyed (their memory reclaimed) when the block exits.  \n* **Visibility** \u2013 Because their name is limited to the block, you can reuse the same variable name in different functions without any conflict.  \n* **Typical storage** \u2013 In most languages they are kept on the call\u2011stack (not the heap).  \n\n**Global variables**  \n\n* **Scope** \u2013 They are declared outside any function, so they are visible to every part of the program (any function can read or modify them).  \n* **Lifetime** \u2013 They are allocated when the program starts and stay alive until the program ends.  \n* **Visibility** \u2013 Because the same name is visible everywhere, you must be careful to avoid naming collisions; many languages let you limit a global\u2019s visibility to a single source file, but it is still \u201cglobal\u201d within that file.  \n* **Typical storage** \u2013 They reside in a fixed area of memory (often the data segment) rather than on the stack.  \n\n**Key differences**  \n\n| Aspect | Local | Global |\n|--------|-------|--------|\n| **Where declared** | Inside a function/block | Outside all functions (top\u2011level) |\n| **Scope** | Limited to that block | Whole program (or whole file, depending on language) |\n| **Lifetime** | Created/Destroyed with each call | Exists for the entire run of the program |\n| **Memory location** | Usually on the call stack | Usually in a static data area |\n| **Name reuse** | Safe to reuse same name in other functions | Must avoid reuse unless you want the same variable |\n\nIn short, local variables are short\u2011lived and confined to a specific part of the code, while global variables persist for the whole program and can be accessed from anywhere (subject to language\u2011specific visibility rules)."

      "question": "Describe a situation where using variables can simplify a programming task.",
      "student_answer": "A common example is calculating the total cost of items in a shopping\u2011cart program.  \n\nInstead of hard\u2011coding numbers each time, you would store the relevant pieces of data in variables:\n\n```python\nprice_per_item = 12.99      # cost of one item\nquantity      = 3           # how many the user wants\ntax_rate      = 0.07       # 7\u202f% sales tax\n```\n\nWith these variables the total can be computed in a single line:\n\n```python\nsubtotal = price_per_item * quantity\ntotal    = subtotal + subtotal * tax_rate\n```\n\nBecause the price, quantity, and tax rate are held in variables, the same code works for any product, any number of items, and any tax rate without needing to be rewritten. If the user changes the quantity or picks a different product, you only update the values of the variables and the rest of the calculation automatically reflects the new data. This makes the program far simpler, more readable, and easier to maintain. (A small slip that sometimes occurs is to multiply the subtotal by the tax rate instead of adding it, but the correct approach is to add the tax amount to the subtotal, as shown above.)"
