      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the first thing you do is **draw a little circle around the spot where the axes intersect** and label it with a letter.\u202fThat way you\u2019ve \u201cplaced\u201d the point before you even look at its coordinates."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you\u2019d put the point three units to the left of the origin and two units down. So I\u2019d put it in the lower\u2011left part of the graph \u2013 kind of around the third quadrant."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How can you ensure accuracy when plotting a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the best way to be accurate is just to draw the point wherever it *looks* right. Like, you can just eyeball the numbers on the axes and put the dot where it seems close enough. Sometimes it helps to use a bright color so you can see it better, and if you\u2019re not sure, just move it a little bit until it feels like it matches the coordinate. I\u2019m not really sure what else to do, but maybe double\u2011checking isn\u2019t that important if the point looks right on the graph."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate when placing a point.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the x\u2011coordinate is the vertical part of a point and the y\u2011coordinate is the horizontal part. So when you place a point, the first number tells you how high up the plane you go, and the second number tells you how far left or right you move. In other words, if you have the point (3,\u202f5), you would go up 3 units and then 5 units to the right. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s how I remember it."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Describe how to place a point at (0, 0) and explain what this point represents.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you put the point (0,\u202f0) by moving three units to the right and then three units down\u2026 or maybe it\u2019s the other way around?  Basically you just draw a dot somewhere near the middle of the graph.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the point (0,\u202f0) is supposed to show where the\u202fx\u2011axis meets the\u202fy\u2011axis\u2026 kind of like a little intersection that tells you the values are both zero.  It might also be the place where the line\u202fy\u202f=\u202fx crosses, or where the slope is undefined\u2014yeah, I\u2019m a bit confused, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How would you place a point with fractional coordinates, such as (2.5, -1.5), on the coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d start at the origin and then\u2026 maybe you go 2.5 units to the left because it\u2019s a \u201cfraction\u201d? And then, since the y\u2011value is \u20131.5, you\u2019d go up 1.5 units? So I guess you\u2019d end up somewhere in the second quadrant, like around (\u20112.5,\u202f1.5). I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from the class."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the importance of consistently labeling axes when placing points?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess consistently labeling the axes isn\u2019t that important when you\u2019re putting points on a graph. I think it\u2019s mostly just for making the picture look neat, like adding a title or a pretty border. The actual coordinates will still be correct even if you mix up the labels, so I don\u2019t see why you have to keep the x\u2011axis and y\u2011axis names the same all the time. Maybe it just helps the teacher see that you tried, but it doesn\u2019t affect the placement of the points at all."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If a point is incorrectly placed, what steps can you take to verify and correct its position?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think if you notice a point is in the wrong spot you can just\u2026 move it wherever looks nice? Maybe you could \u201ccheck\u201d it by asking a friend if it looks right, or just redraw the whole picture from memory. I guess another thing is to ignore the axes and just put the point where you think it belongs, because the grid lines don\u2019t really matter that much. If it still looks off, you could just leave it where it is \u2013 it probably won\u2019t affect anything anyway."
