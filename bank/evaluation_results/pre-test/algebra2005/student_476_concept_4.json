      "question": "What is the first step in solving an equation with a negative coefficient, such as -2x/3 = 4?",
      "student_answer": "The first step is to get rid of the negative coefficient by multiplying both sides by its reciprocal.  \nFor \\(-\\dfrac{2}{3}x = 4\\), multiply both sides by \\(-\\dfrac{3}{2}\\) (the reciprocal of \\(-\\dfrac{2}{3}\\)). This clears the fraction and the negative sign, leaving \\(x\\) isolated."

      "question": "Explain why taking the reciprocal of both sides of the equation ax/b = c is necessary when solving for x.",
      "student_answer": "When we start with  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{ax}{b}=c ,\n\\]\n\nthe variable \\(x\\) is **inside** a fraction. To isolate \\(x\\) we need to get rid of that fraction. One systematic way to do that is to take the **reciprocal** of both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{ax}= \\frac{1}{c}.\n\\]\n\nHere\u2019s why the reciprocal step is useful:\n\n1. **Flips the fraction that contains \\(x\\).**  \n   In \\(\\frac{ax}{b}\\) the unknown \\(x\\) appears in the numerator. By reciprocating, \\(x\\) moves to the denominator, turning the expression into \\(\\frac{b}{ax}\\). This makes it easier to \u201cfree\u201d \\(x\\) from a product in the denominator.\n\n2. **Preserves equality.**  \n   The reciprocal operation is a legitimate algebraic manipulation: if two numbers are equal, their reciprocals are also equal (provided neither side is zero). So the truth of the equation is maintained.\n\n3. **Leaves a simple product with \\(x\\).**  \n   After reciprocating we have \\(\\frac{b}{ax}= \\frac{1}{c}\\). The only operation now needed to isolate \\(x\\) is multiplication:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{b}{ax}\\cdot a = \\frac{1}{c}\\cdot a \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad \\frac{b}{x}= \\frac{a}{c}.\n   \\]\n   Then multiply both sides by \\(x\\) and divide by \\(\\frac{a}{c}\\) (or multiply by its reciprocal) to obtain\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{b}{a\\,c}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Alternative view: same result by clearing fractions.**  \n   You could also multiply the original equation by \\(b\\) and then divide by \\(a\\):\n   \\[\n   ax = bc \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; x = \\frac{bc}{a}.\n   \\]\n   Taking the reciprocal is just another path that leads to the same algebraic steps; it makes the intermediate expression \\(\\frac{b}{ax}\\) visibly simpler to manipulate.\n\n**In summary**, taking the reciprocal of both sides rearranges the equation so that \\(x\\) appears in a single denominator, after which only multiplication and division are needed to solve for \\(x\\). This step is mathematically valid and streamlines the isolation of the variable."
