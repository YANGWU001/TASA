      "student_answer": "I think place value is what lets us break a huge number into more manageable parts.\u202fEach digit \u201cknows\u201d its size because its position tells us which power of\u202f10\u202fit represents.\u202fFor example, in the number\u202f48\u202f736, the\u202f4\u202fis in the\u202ften\u2011thousands place, so it means\u202f4\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f000\u202f=\u202f40\u202f000; the\u202f8\u202fis in the\u202fthousands place (8\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f000\u202f=\u202f8\u202f000), the\u202f7\u202fis in the\u202fhundreds place (7\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202f=\u202f700), and so on.\u202fBecause we can read each place separately, we can add the parts together to understand the whole number.\n\nThe idea also helps us compare sizes: a digit that\u2019s farther to the left is worth more than a digit that\u2019s farther to the right, so the left\u2011most digit is the biggest\u2011valued one.\u202f(Actually, I\u2019m a little unsure whether the right\u2011most digit sometimes counts as the biggest value in some contexts, but usually the left side is the most significant.)  \n\nSo, by knowing the place values, we can see how many millions, thousands, or units are in a number, make calculations more systematic, and avoid mixing up the sizes of the digits."
