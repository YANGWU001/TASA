It occurs when the\u202fx\u2011coordinate is\u202f0, so the y\u2011intercept is the value of\u202fy at\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0 (often written as the ordered pair\u202f(0,\u202fb)\u202for simply\u202fb\u202fin the line equation\u202fy\u202f=\u202fmx\u202f+\u202fb)."

Plugging\u202f\\(x = 0\\) into the equation gives  \n\n\\[\ny = m(0) + b = b.\n\\]\n\nSo the y\u2011intercept is the constant\u202f\\(b\\), and the intercept point is \\((0,\\;b)\\). If the equation isn\u2019t already in this form, you first rewrite it as \\(y = mx + b\\) and then read off the \\(b\\) term."

      "student_answer": "The y\u2011axis is the vertical line on a graph where the\u202fx\u2011coordinate is always\u202f0.  \nWhen a straight line is drawn, the only place it can \u201cmeet\u201d the y\u2011axis is at a point whose\u202fx\u2011value is\u202f0.  \n\nIf we write the equation of the line in slope\u2011intercept form,  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nthe term\u202f\\(b\\) is the value of\u202f\\(y\\) when\u202f\\(x = 0\\). Substituting \\(x = 0\\) gives  \n\n\\[\ny = m(0) + b = b.\n\\]\n\nThus the point \\((0,\\;b)\\) lies on both the line and the y\u2011axis. That point is called the **y\u2011intercept** because it is the point where the line **intercepts** (crosses) the y\u2011axis. In other words, the y\u2011intercept is simply the coordinate on the y\u2011axis where the line\u2019s x\u2011value is zero."

      "student_answer": "The **y\u2011intercept** is defined as the point where the graph meets the **y\u2011axis**.  \nAll points that lie on the y\u2011axis have the same horizontal position: they are directly above or below the origin. In coordinate\u2011plane terms, that horizontal position is recorded as the **x\u2011coordinate**.  \n\nSince the y\u2011axis consists of all points whose x\u2011value is zero (\u202f\\(x = 0\\)\u202f), any point on that axis\u2014including the point where the graph crosses it\u2014must have an x\u2011coordinate of 0.  \n\nTherefore, at the y\u2011intercept the coordinates are \\((0,\\,y_{\\text{intercept}})\\); the x\u2011coordinate is always zero because the point is on the y\u2011axis."

      "student_answer": "To graph a line when you\u2019re given its slope\u202f\\(m\\) and its y\u2011intercept\u202f\\(b\\):\n\n1. **Plot the y\u2011intercept** \u2013 This is the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis, so it\u2019s at \\((0,\\;b)\\). Put a dot at that coordinate on your grid.\n\n2. **Use the slope to find a second point** \u2013 The slope tells you the \u201crise over run\u201d (how many units you move up or down for each unit you move to the right).  \n   - If the slope is a positive whole number (e.g., \\(m = 3\\)), start at the y\u2011intercept, go **up 3 units** and **right 1 unit**; the point you land on is \\((1,\\;b+3)\\).  \n   - If the slope is a negative whole number (e.g., \\(m = -2\\)), go **down 2 units** and **right 1 unit** to reach \\((1,\\;b-2)\\).  \n   - If the slope is a fraction (e.g., \\(m = \\frac{2}{5}\\)), you can simplify the \u201crun\u201d to avoid fractions: go **up 2 units** and **right 5 units**, landing at \\((5,\\;b+2)\\).  \n   - If the slope is a negative fraction, go down the numerator and right the denominator (or left if you prefer).\n\n3. **Mark that second point** on the graph.\n\n4. **Draw the line** \u2013 Use a ruler (or a straight edge) to connect the two points, then extend the line across the grid in both directions. Because a line is infinite, you can continue the line past the drawn points.\n\n5. **Check (optional)** \u2013 Verify the line\u2019s equation matches the form \\(y = mx + b\\) by picking another x\u2011value, computing the corresponding y\u2011value using the slope\u2011intercept formula, and seeing if that point lies on your drawn line.\n\nThat\u2019s it! With the intercept to anchor the line and the slope to give the direction, you can quickly sketch any straight line."
