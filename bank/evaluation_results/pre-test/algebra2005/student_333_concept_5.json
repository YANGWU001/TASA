      "student_answer": "Having a negative coefficient in front of the \\(x\\) term just means you have to be careful about the signs when you move things around.  In the equation  \n\n\\[\n-ax + b = c,\n\\]\n\nthe first step is usually to isolate the term that contains \\(x\\).  You can do this by subtracting \\(b\\) from both sides (or moving the \\(b\\) to the right\u2011hand side):\n\n\\[\n-ax = c - b .\n\\]\n\nNow, because the coefficient of \\(x\\) is \\(-a\\) (which is negative), you have to divide **by \\(-a\\)** to solve for \\(x\\).  Dividing by a negative number flips the sign of the fraction, so\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{c-b}{-a}.\n\\]\n\nOften it\u2019s cleaner to rewrite that as\n\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{c-b}{a} \\qquad\\text{or}\\qquad x = \\frac{b-c}{a},\n\\]\n\nsince multiplying the numerator and denominator by \\(-1\\) cancels the minus sign in the denominator.\n\nThe key point is that the negative coefficient doesn\u2019t change the algebraic steps; it just means you end up with a minus sign either in the denominator or, equivalently, in the numerator after simplifying.  If you forget to carry that sign through the division, you\u2019ll get the opposite (incorrect) answer.  \n\nSo, in short: treat \\(-ax\\) like any other term, move the other terms to the other side, then divide by \\(-a\\) and remember that dividing by a negative flips the sign."
