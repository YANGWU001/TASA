  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of negative slopes, particularly in identifying equations and real-world applications. However, there are significant misconceptions, especially regarding the direction of lines with negative slopes and how to determine slope from points and equations. The student needs to review the definitions and characteristics of slopes more thoroughly.",

      "question": "What does a negative slope indicate about the direction of a line on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a negative slope means the line actually goes **upward** as you move from left to right on the graph.  (So it\u2019s sloping up, not down.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one possible equation is  \n\n\\[\ny = -3x + 2\n\\]\n\nThe \u201c\u20113\u201d in front of the \\(x\\) is the slope, so the line should have a negative slope.  \nBecause the slope is negative, the line **goes down** (decreases) as you move to the right (as \\(x\\) gets bigger). The number\u202f2 is the \\(y\\)-intercept, so the line crosses the \\(y\\)-axis at the point \\((0,2)\\).\n\nI guess the line would look kind of steep because the absolute value of the slope is 3, which means for every 1 unit you move right, the line goes 3 units down.  \n(I'm not totally sure if that means the line rises or falls, but I think a negative number means it falls.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What is the difference between a positive slope and a negative slope in terms of graph direction?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope is when the line goes **down** as you move from left to right, and a negative slope is when the line goes **up** as you move from left to right.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope comes out to be **+1**.  \n\nI did the \u201crise over run\u201d thing: the change in\u202fy is \\(5 - 1 = 4\\) and the change in\u202fx is \\(3 - 7 = -4\\).  Dividing gives \\(4 \u00f7 (-4) = -1\\), but I think I might have mixed up the signs, so the slope is actually **+1**.  \n\nSo, the line\u2019s slope is positive, not negative."

The equation is  \n\n\\[\ny = -3x + 4,\n\\]\n\nso I guess the slope is **+3** (I\u2019m not totally sure).  That would mean for every 1 unit you move to the right, the line goes up about 3 units.  The y\u2011intercept is at \\((0,4)\\), so you\u2019d start at 4 on the y\u2011axis and draw a line that rises from there.  (You could also pick a point like \\((1,7)\\) and draw the line through \\((0,4)\\) and \\((1,7)\\).)  \n\nI\u2019m not confident I got the sign right, but that\u2019s what I think."

      "question": "Explain why a line with a negative slope always decreases as it moves from left to right.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a line with a negative slope goes down when you move from left to right because the slope tells you how much\u202fy\u202fchanges for a change in\u202fx. When the slope is negative, a positive change in\u202fx\u202fgives a negative change in\u202fy, so the\u202fy\u2011value gets smaller and the line looks like it\u2019s decreasing.\n\nI guess that also means the x\u2011values are getting smaller, which makes the y\u2011values bigger\u2026\u202for is it the other way around?\u202fI\u2019m not really sure, but I think the main idea is that a negative \u201crise over run\u201d makes the line go down as you go to the right."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think we can rewrite the equation as\u202fy\u202f=\u202f2x\u202f+\u202f10, so the slope looks like it\u2019s\u202f2. Since\u202f2\u202fis positive, the slope isn\u2019t negative."
