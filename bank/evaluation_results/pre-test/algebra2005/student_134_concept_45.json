      "student_answer": "A negative slope means the line falls as you move from left to right \u2013 as\u202fx\u202fincreases,\u202fy\u202fdecreases, so the line slopes downward."

      "student_answer": "I think the line falls as you move from left to right, since a negative slope (\u20112) means the y\u2011value decreases when x increases."

In other words, for each increase of\u202f1\u202funit in\u202f\\(x\\), the value of\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fdecreases by\u202f3\u202funits.

      "student_answer": "You can tell a slope is negative by looking at the direction the line goes as you move\u202fright\u202falong the\u202fx\u2011axis.  \nIf the line **falls** \u2013 that is, the\u202fy\u2011value gets lower when the\u202fx\u2011value gets larger \u2013 the slope is negative. In practice you can pick two points on the line: if the second point has a larger\u202fx\u2011coordinate but a smaller\u202fy\u2011coordinate, the slope is negative.  \n\n(For contrast, a line that rises as you go right has a positive slope, a horizontal line has slope\u202f0, and a vertical line has an undefined slope.)"

      "question": "Explain how the concept of a negative slope applies in real-world scenarios, such as descending a hill.",
      "student_answer": "The idea of a **negative slope** just means that as you move in the positive\u2011direction along the ground, the height of the surface gets lower. In a real\u2011world picture this is what happens when you\u2019re **going down a hill**.\n\n* **What the numbers mean** \u2013 If you write the hill as a line\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\) and the slope \\(m\\) is negative (for example, \\(m = \u20130.4\\)), then for every 1\u202fm you travel forward you lose 0.4\u202fm of elevation. The graph tilts downward, so the line falls as you move to the right.\n\n* **Walking or driving downhill** \u2013 When you step forward on a slope with a negative\u202f\\(m\\), your feet (or wheels) move to a lower altitude. That is why you feel you are \u201cgoing down.\u201d In many cases you\u2019ll also feel a pull of gravity that can make you accelerate, although the amount of acceleration depends on friction and the exact steepness.\n\n* **Energy and work** \u2013 Because the height is decreasing, the gravitational potential energy of an object is being turned into kinetic energy (or into heat if you\u2019re braking). That\u2019s why a bike can pick up speed without pedaling when the road has a negative slope.\n\n* **Design and safety** \u2013 Engineers use the negative\u2011slope concept when they design roads, ski runs, or roller\u2011coaster drops. They calculate the slope so that the decline isn\u2019t too steep (which would be unsafe) but is enough to keep vehicles moving.\n\n* **Everyday examples** \u2013  \n  \u2013 A driveway that goes down to a garage.  \n  \u2013 A hiking trail that descends a mountain.  \n  \u2013 A water slide that slopes downward so water and the rider flow toward the bottom.\n\n**Common misunderstandings** \u2013 Some people think a negative slope means the hill gets \u201csteeper\u201d as you go down, but the sign only tells you the direction of change (downward), not that the steepness itself is increasing. The steepness is given by the absolute value \\(|m|\\). So a slope of \u20130.2 is shallow, while \u20132.0 is very steep, even though both are negative.\n\nIn short, a negative slope in the real world is simply a downhill direction: moving forward makes you lose height, which shows up as a line that leans downward on a graph."

The negative sign means the line goes down (negative rise) when moving to the right, which is exactly what we see on the graph. So, yes \u2013 the slope is negative."

      "student_answer": "A line with a **positive slope** is one whose slope value is greater than\u202f0.  As you move from left to right along the line, the\u202fy\u2011value **increases**, so the line tilts upward to the right.  \n\nA line with a **negative slope** has a slope value less than\u202f0.  When you go from left to right, the\u202fy\u2011value **decreases**, so the line tilts downward to the right (or upward to the left).  \n\n**Similarities**  \n- Both are straight lines with a constant rate of change (the slope) everywhere on the line.  \n- Both can be written in the form\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\) where\u202f\\(m\\) is the slope and\u202f\\(b\\) is the y\u2011intercept.  \n\n**Differences**  \n- The sign of\u202f\\(m\\) determines the direction:\u202f\\(m>0\\) gives a line that rises as\u202f\\(x\\) increases;\u202f\\(m<0\\) gives a line that falls as\u202f\\(x\\) increases.  \n- The angle the line makes with the positive\u202fx\u2011axis is acute for a positive slope and obtuse for a negative slope (though the absolute value of the angle can be the same).  \n\n*(One thing that is NOT always true is that the two lines must share the same y\u2011intercept; they can intersect the y\u2011axis at different points.)*"

      "student_answer": "**Answer: False**\n\nA horizontal line has a slope of\u202f0, not a negative value. A negative slope means that as\u202f*x*\u202fincreases,\u202f*y*\u202fdecreases, so the line tilts downward (it \u201cfalls\u201d) rather than staying flat. Therefore a negative slope does **not** indicate a horizontal line.   (I think that\u2019s right.)"
