  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of multiplication and division, correctly solving most problems. However, there were minor errors in the simplification of expressions, particularly in Question 3 where the student miscalculated the product. Overall, the student shows good grasp of nested operations but should double-check calculations for accuracy.",
