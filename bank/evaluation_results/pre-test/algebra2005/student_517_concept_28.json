    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain how place value helps in understanding large numbers.",
      "student_answer": "Place value is the idea that each digit in a number stands for a certain \u201csize\u201d or power of ten.  \n- The digit in the **ones** place tells you how many ones you have.  \n- The digit in the **tens** place tells you how many tens you have (so a\u202f2 in the tens place means 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f20).  \n- The digit in the **hundreds** place tells you how many hundreds you have, and the **thousands** place tells you how many thousands, and so on.\n\nBecause each place is ten times larger than the one to its right, you can break a large number into a sum of its parts. For example, \u202f3\u202f5\u202f2\u202f1 can be read as  \n\n3\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f000\u202f+\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f000\u202f+\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202f+\u202f1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10,  \n\nwhich shows exactly how many tens, hundreds, thousands, etc., are in the number.  \nSeeing a number this way makes it easier to compare sizes (a larger digit in a higher\u2011value place means a bigger number), to add or subtract numbers by lining up the same places, and to spot patterns.\n\n*(One small mix\u2011up I sometimes make is thinking the tens place actually represents hundreds, but it really represents tens.)*"
