      "question": "How does having a negative coefficient for x in the equation -ax + b = c affect the solution process?",
      "student_answer": "Having a negative coefficient in front of the \\(x\\) term simply means that the \u201c\\(x\\)\u201d part of the equation points in the opposite direction on the number line, but the algebraic steps you use to isolate \\(x\\) are exactly the same as when the coefficient is positive \u2013 you just have to keep careful track of the sign changes.\n\nFor the specific form  \n\n\\[\n-ax + b = c\\qquad (a>0)\n\\]\n\nthe solution proceeds as follows:\n\n1. **Move the constant term to the other side.**  \n   Subtract \\(b\\) from both sides:\n\n   \\[\n   -ax = c - b .\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divide by the coefficient of \\(x\\).**  \n   Because the coefficient is \\(-a\\), you divide both sides by \\(-a\\):\n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{c - b}{-a}.\n   \\]\n\n   Dividing by a negative number flips the sign of the fraction, so you can also write the answer as  \n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{b - c}{a}.\n   \\]\n\n   (Both forms are equivalent; the second one often looks a bit cleaner because the denominator is now positive.)\n\n3. **Interpret the result.**  \n   The negative coefficient essentially reverses the relationship between \\(x\\) and the right\u2011hand side: if the right\u2011hand side \\(c\\) gets larger, the value of \\(x\\) actually becomes *smaller* (more negative) because of the leading minus sign.\n\n---\n\n### Key points to remember\n\n- **Sign tracking:** Whenever you move a term across the equals sign, its sign changes. The same rule applies when you divide or multiply by a negative number.\n- **Equivalent forms:** \\(\\displaystyle x = \\frac{c-b}{-a}\\) and \\(\\displaystyle x = \\frac{b-c}{a}\\) are the same solution; choose the one that looks simplest for you.\n- **Conceptual effect:** The negative coefficient does not change the mechanics of solving the equation; it only reverses the direction of the linear relationship between \\(x\\) and the other constants.\n\nSo, a negative coefficient for \\(x\\) mostly requires you to be extra careful with sign changes, but the overall solution process\u2014isolating the term with \\(x\\) and then dividing by its coefficient\u2014remains unchanged."
