      "question": "Is 0.1 considered a small number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "I think\u202f0.1\u202fis usually regarded as a small number. It\u2019s only a tenth of\u202f1, so its magnitude is much less than whole\u2011number values like\u202f1,\u202f10, or\u202f100. Because it\u2019s less than\u202f1, we often call numbers in the range\u202f0\u202fto\u202f1\u202f\u201csmall\u201d in everyday contexts (e.g., measurements, probabilities, or fractions).  However, \u201csmall\u201d can be relative\u2014if you were comparing\u202f0.1\u202fto\u202f0.000001, then\u202f0.1\u202fmight actually seem large. But in most typical situations,\u202f0.1\u202fis considered a small number because of its low value."

      "question": "If you multiply a small number like 0.01 by 10, is the result still considered small? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Multiplying\u202f0.01\u202fby\u202f10 gives  \n\n\\[\n0.01 \\times 10 = 0.10.\n\\]\n\nThe result,\u202f0.10\u202f(or\u202f0.1), is still less than\u202f1, so it would generally be regarded as a \u201csmall\u201d number. It\u2019s bigger than the original\u202f0.01, but it hasn\u2019t become a large or \u201cbig\u201d value\u2014just a slightly larger small number. \n\nSo, yes, the result is still considered small (though it\u2019s a bit larger than the starting number)."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How does adding a small number, such as 0.001, to a large number affect the result?",
      "student_answer": "I think adding a really tiny number such as\u202f0.001\u202fto a much larger number only changes the result by a very small amount \u2013 basically it\u2019s almost negligible, so the large number stays pretty much the same."

      "question": "Can negative numbers be considered small numbers? Provide an example to support your answer.",
      "student_answer": "I think negative numbers can be considered \u201csmall\u201d when we\u2019re talking about how close they are to zero.\u202fFor example, \u20133 is a small number because its absolute value (|\u20113|\u202f=\u202f3) is low compared to numbers like \u201320 or \u2013100.\u202fSo, in that sense \u20133 would be a small number, while \u2013100 would be a much larger (or \u201cbig\u201d) negative number.\u202f(I'm a little unsure whether everyone uses the term \u201csmall\u201d for negatives, but that\u2019s how I understand it.)"

      "question": "If you divide a small number, such as 0.02, by a large number, will the result be smaller or larger? Explain.",
      "student_answer": "I think the result will actually be larger. When you divide a very small number like\u202f0.02\u202fby a much bigger number, the division \u201cspreads out\u2019\u2019 the small amount over a larger divisor, which makes the quotient bigger than the original small number. In other words, the large denominator pushes the value upward, so the result ends up larger than\u202f0.02."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Write a real-world example where using small numbers is important.",
      "student_answer": "I think one everyday situation where using small numbers is really important is when a pharmacist or a doctor measures out a medication dose.  \nFor example, a child\u2019s pain\u2011relief medicine might need to be given in **0.25\u202fmL** (or **250\u202f\u00b5L**) per dose. If the caregiver uses the wrong amount\u2014even just a few hundredths of a milliliter\u2014the child could get too little relief (or, in the worst case, an overdose).  \n\nBecause the numbers are so tiny, the person measuring has to pay close attention to the markings on the syringe or dropper and double\u2011check the calculation (e.g., converting\u202f2\u202fmg\u202f/\u202fmL to the exact volume needed). Small\u2011number accuracy is crucial for the medication to be safe and effective."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What happens to a small number like 0.005 if you square it? Does it remain small?",
      "student_answer": "When you square a tiny number it gets even tinier.  \nFor example  \n\n\\[\n0.005^2 = 0.005 \\times 0.005 = 0.000025,\n\\]\n\nwhich is a lot smaller than the original 0.005. So yes\u2014squaring a small number like 0.005 keeps it small (in fact, makes it smaller)."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How does the concept of small numbers help in scientific calculations or measurements?",
      "student_answer": "The idea of \u201csmall numbers\u201d is useful in science because it lets us work with quantities that are easy to handle on a calculator or on paper.  When the values we are adding, multiplying or dividing are all relatively tiny, the arithmetic tends to stay simple and we don\u2019t have to worry as much about rounding\u2011off big\u2011digit numbers or about the computer \u201coverflowing\u201d (which can happen with huge values).  \n\nIn measurements, using a small\u2011scale unit (for example millimetres instead of kilometres) lets us see fine detail and to compare tiny changes that would be lost if we only recorded the data in big units.  Because the differences are small, the absolute error of the instrument is often a smaller fraction of the measurement, so the relative error can be lower.  \n\nI think this also means that scientists can often ignore scientific notation when the numbers are small, which makes the equations look cleaner.  Probably the main benefit is that the calculations stay manageable and the chance of making a big arithmetic mistake is reduced.  (Sometimes, however, if the numbers are *too* small they can lead to loss of precision due to rounding, but that\u2019s another issue.)"
