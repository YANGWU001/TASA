      "student_answer": "**Entering the slope** (sometimes called the *left\u2011hand slope* or *left\u2011hand derivative*) is the slope of a curve as it approaches a given point\u202f\\(a\\) from the left side.  \n\nFormally, if \\(f\\) is a function defined on an interval that contains points to the left of \\(a\\), the entering slope at \\(a\\) is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\displaystyle \n\\lim_{h\\to 0^{-}}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}\n}\n\\]\n\nprovided this limit exists.  \n\nIn words: it is the instantaneous rate of change of \\(f\\) at \\(a\\) as you \u201center\u201d the point from the left, i.e., the slope of the tangent line approached by secant lines drawn from points left of \\(a\\) toward \\(a\\)."

      "student_answer": "The slope\u202f=\u202f2 tells you how steep the line is and the direction it goes.  \nSpecifically, it means that for every increase of\u202f1 unit in the horizontal direction (the \u201crun\u201d), the vertical coordinate (the \u201crise\u201d) increases by\u202f2 units. In other words, the line rises 2 units for each 1\u2011unit step to the right, indicating an upward\u2011sloping line with a steepness of\u202f2."

      "question": "Explain how the slope can be used to determine the steepness of a line.",
      "student_answer": "The slope of a line is the ratio of its **rise** (the vertical change) to its **run** (the horizontal change).  In algebraic form this is written as  \n\n\\[\n\\text{slope}=m=\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}.\n\\]\n\nBecause the slope measures how much \\(y\\) changes for a given change in \\(x\\), it directly tells us how \u201csteep\u2019\u2019 the line is:\n\n| Situation | Slope value | Interpretation of steepness |\n|-----------|-------------|-----------------------------|\n| \\(m = 0\\) | Zero | The line is perfectly horizontal; it has no steepness. |\n| \\(|m|\\) is small (e.g., \\(m = 0.2\\) or \\(-0.5\\)) | Small absolute value | The line is shallow; it rises or falls only a little for each unit of run. |\n| \\(|m|\\) is large (e.g., \\(m = 3\\) or \\(-4\\)) | Large absolute value | The line is steep; it rises or falls a lot for each unit of run. |\n| \\(m\\) is positive | The line rises from left to right (upward). |\n| \\(m\\) is negative | The line falls from left to right (downward). |\n| \\(m\\) is undefined (division by zero) | The line is vertical; its steepness is \u201cinfinite\u2019\u2019 because there is no horizontal change. |\n\n### How to use slope to compare steepness\n1. **Compute the slope** of each line using two points on the line: \\(m = (y_2-y_1)/(x_2-x_1)\\).\n2. **Take the absolute value** \\(|m|\\).  This removes the sign (upward vs. downward) and leaves only the magnitude of steepness.\n3. **Compare the magnitudes**: the line with the larger \\(|m|\\) is steeper.  \n   - Example: Line A has \\(m = 2\\) (|2| = 2) and Line B has \\(m = -1/3\\) (|\u20111/3| = 0.333).  Line A is steeper.\n\nThus, the slope provides a quantitative measure of steepness: the greater the absolute value of the slope, the steeper the line; a slope of zero indicates no steepness, and an undefined slope corresponds to a perfectly vertical line."

      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011world situation where you need to calculate the slope is when **designing a wheelchair ramp** to meet accessibility standards.\n\n* **Why the slope matters:**  \n  The ramp must be gentle enough that a person in a wheelchair can push the wheels up without excessive effort, and it must also comply with building\u2011code regulations (for example, the ADA in the United States requires a maximum slope of\u202f1\u202f:\u202f12, which is the same as a 5\u202f% grade).\n\n* **How you calculate it:**  \n  1. Measure the vertical rise\u202f\\(\u0394y\\) \u2013 the height the ramp needs to reach (e.g., 30\u202fcm).  \n  2. Measure the horizontal run\u202f\\(\u0394x\\) \u2013 the length of floor space you have for the ramp (e.g., 360\u202fcm).  \n  3. Compute the slope \\(m = \\frac{\u0394y}{\u0394x}\\).  \n     \\[\n     m = \\frac{30\\text{\u202fcm}}{360\\text{\u202fcm}} = 0.0833\\ (\\text{about }8.3\\% \\text{ grade})\n     \\]\n\n* **What you do with the result:**  \n  Because the calculated slope (\u2248\u202f8.3\u202f%) is steeper than the allowed 5\u202f% (or 1\u202f:\u202f12), you would need to either increase the run (make the ramp longer) or lower the required height. Adjusting the design until the slope meets the 0.0833\u202f\u2248\u202f5\u202f% limit ensures the ramp is safe and code\u2011compliant.\n\n*(A minor point of confusion that often appears: people sometimes think \u201cslope =\u202f5\u202f% means a 5\u2011degree angle,\u201d but the slope is a ratio (rise/run) and is unit\u2011less; the angle corresponding to a 5\u202f% slope is actually about 2.86\u00b0, not 5\u00b0.)*"

      "student_answer": "A slope of\u202f\u20113 means the line falls (decreases) as you move from left to right. In other words, for every\u202f+1 increase in\u202f\\(x\\), the\u202f\\(y\\)-value drops by\u202f3. Thus the line slopes steeply downward in the positive\u2011\\(x\\) direction."

      "student_answer": "**Understanding the slope formula**\n\nThe slope of a straight line tells you how \u201csteep\u201d the line is.  \nMathematically it is defined as the **ratio of the vertical change** to the **horizontal change** between any two points on the line.\n\n\\[\nm \\;=\\; \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{\\,x_2 - x_1\\,}\n\\]\n\nwhere  \n\n* \\((x_1 , y_1)\\) = the coordinates of the first point  \n* \\((x_2 , y_2)\\) = the coordinates of the second point  \n* \\(m\\) = the slope (sometimes called \u201crise over run\u201d).\n\n---\n\n### Step\u2011by\u2011step how the formula works\n\n| Step | What you do | Why it matters |\n|------|-------------|----------------|\n| **1. Choose two points** on the line.  | Write down their coordinates: \\((x_1 , y_1)\\) and \\((x_2 , y_2)\\). | Any two distinct points on the same straight line will give the same slope. |\n| **2. Compute the \u201crise\u201d (vertical change).** | Subtract the y\u2011coordinate of the first point from the y\u2011coordinate of the second: \\(y_2 - y_1\\). | This tells you how far you move up (positive) or down (negative) when going from point\u202f1 to point\u202f2. |\n| **3. Compute the \u201crun\u201d (horizontal change).** | Subtract the x\u2011coordinate of the first point from the x\u2011coordinate of the second: \\(x_2 - x_1\\). | This tells you how far you move right (positive) or left (negative) between the two points. |\n| **4. Form the ratio (rise \u00f7 run).** | Divide the result from step\u202f2 by the result from step\u202f3: \\(\\dfrac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\). | This ratio is the slope \\(m\\). It expresses \u201cvertical change per unit horizontal change.\u201d |\n| **5. Interpret the sign and magnitude.** | \u2022 **Positive slope** \u2192 line rises as you go left\u2011to\u2011right.<br>\u2022 **Negative slope** \u2192 line falls as you go left\u2011to\u2011right.<br>\u2022 **Zero slope** \u2192 horizontal line (no vertical change).<br>\u2022 **Undefined slope** (division by zero) \u2192 vertical line. | The sign tells the direction, the absolute value tells how steep the line is. |\n\n---\n\n### Quick example\n\nTake points \\(A(2, 3)\\) and \\(B(5, 11)\\).\n\n1. **Rise:** \\(y_2 - y_1 = 11 - 3 = 8\\).  \n2. **Run:** \\(x_2 - x_1 = 5 - 2 = 3\\).  \n3. **Slope:** \\(m = \\dfrac{8}{3} \\approx 2.67\\).\n\nInterpretation: For every 3 units you move to the right, the line goes up 8 units (\u22482.67 units up per 1 unit right). The positive sign tells us the line rises as we move left\u2011to\u2011right.\n\n---\n\n### Things to watch out for\n\n* **Order matters** \u2013 always subtract the coordinates of the same point first (e.g., \\(y_2 - y_1\\), not \\(y_1 - y_2\\)). Reversing the order flips the sign of the slope.\n* **Division by zero** \u2013 if \\(x_2 = x_1\\) the denominator is zero and the slope is undefined; that\u2019s a vertical line.\n* **Consistent units** \u2013 make sure the units on the x\u2011 and y\u2011axes are comparable, otherwise the numeric slope will be misleading.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nThe slope formula is simply **\u201crise over run.\u201d** By calculating the vertical change between two points and dividing by the horizontal change, you obtain a single number \\(m\\) that fully describes how steep a straight line is and in which direction it tilts."

      "student_answer": "**Slope:**\u202fThe slope of the line \\(y = 4x - 7\\) is **4**.\n\n**Significance:**  \n- The slope tells us how steep the line is. A slope of 4 means that for every increase of **1 unit** in the \\(x\\)-direction, the value of \\(y\\) increases by **4 units**.  \n- It represents the *rate of change* of \\(y\\) with respect to \\(x\\). In real\u2011world contexts, this could be interpreted as \u201cfor each unit increase in the independent variable, the dependent variable grows by four units.\u201d  \n- Because the slope is positive, the line rises as we move from left to right across the coordinate plane.  \n\nSo, the slope \\(m = 4\\) captures both the steepness and the direction (upward) of the line, and it quantifies how \\(y\\) changes when \\(x\\) changes."
