      "question": "What does the term 'Combine Like Terms (CLT)' mean in algebra?",
      "student_answer": "**Combine Like Terms (CLT)** means simplifying an algebraic expression by adding (or subtracting) together the terms that have exactly the same variable part\u2014that is, the same variables raised to the same powers.\n\n- **\u201cLike\u201d terms** share the same *variable* and the *same exponent(s)*.  \n  Example: \\(3x^2\\) and \\(-5x^2\\) are like terms because both contain \\(x^2\\).  \n  In contrast, \\(3x\\) and \\(3x^2\\) are **not** like terms; the exponents differ.\n\n- **The process:**  \n  1. Identify groups of like terms in the expression.  \n  2. Add the coefficients (the numeric parts) of each group, keeping the common variable part unchanged.  \n  3. Rewrite the expression using the summed coefficients.\n\n**Example**\n\n\\[\n7x + 3x - 2y + 5y - 4 = (7x+3x) + (-2y+5y) - 4 = 10x + 3y - 4\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(7x\\) and \\(3x\\) were combined into \\(10x\\); \\(-2y\\) and \\(5y\\) were combined into \\(3y\\); the constant \\(-4\\) stays as is because it has no variable.\n\n**Why we do it**\n\nCombining like terms reduces an expression to its simplest form, making it easier to solve equations, factor, or perform further algebraic manipulations."

      "question": "Why is it important to combine like terms when solving algebraic expressions?",
      "student_answer": "Combining like terms is a fundamental step in simplifying algebraic expressions, and it matters for several reasons:\n\n1. **Reduces Complexity** \u2013 By adding or subtracting coefficients of the same variable (e.g., \\(3x + 5x = 8x\\)), you replace many separate terms with a single term. This makes the expression shorter and easier to read.\n\n2. **Preserves Equality** \u2013 Like terms have the same variable part raised to the same power, so they can be combined without changing the value of the expression. This keeps the relationship between the variables and constants intact while you manipulate the expression.\n\n3. **Prepares for Solving** \u2013 Most solution techniques (factoring, applying the distributive property, solving equations, etc.) work best on a simplified expression. When like terms are combined, you can more readily isolate the variable, factor common factors, or spot patterns.\n\n4. **Prevents Errors** \u2013 Working with a cluttered expression increases the chance of mis\u2011applying operations or overlooking terms. Simplifying first creates a clear, organized form that reduces the risk of arithmetic mistakes.\n\n5. **Facilitates Comparison** \u2013 When you need to check whether two expressions are equivalent, having each expression in its simplest (combined\u2011like\u2011terms) form makes the comparison straightforward.\n\nIn short, combining like terms streamlines the expression, maintains its value, and sets the stage for the next steps in solving or simplifying algebraic problems."

      "student_answer": "**Combining like terms (the \u201csame\u2011variable\u201d rule)**  \n\nIn an algebraic expression, *like terms* are terms that contain exactly the same variable\u2011part \u2013 that means the same letters **and** the same exponents on each letter.  \n\nTo combine such terms you:\n\n1. **Leave the variable\u2011part untouched.**  \n   The letters and their powers stay exactly as they are.\n\n2. **Add (or subtract) the numerical coefficients** in front of those identical variable\u2011parts.  \n\nThe result is a single term whose coefficient is the sum (or difference) of the original coefficients and whose variable\u2011part is unchanged.\n\n**Example**\n\n\\[\n3x^{2}y \\;+\\; 5x^{2}y \\;-\\; 2x^{2}y\n\\]\n\nAll three terms are like because each contains \\(x^{2}y\\).  \nCombine the coefficients:\n\n\\[\n(3+5-2)x^{2}y = 6x^{2}y.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### A common slip to watch out for  \n\nSometimes students mistakenly think you also **add the exponents** when you combine like terms.  \n*That is not correct.* The exponents stay the same; only the coefficients are combined.  \n\nSo the rule, put succinctly, is: **Add or subtract the coefficients of terms that have exactly the same variable\u2011part; do not change the variable\u2011part itself.**"

      "question": "Give a real-life example where combining like terms might be helpful in simplifying calculations.",
      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011life situation where combining like terms makes the arithmetic much easier is **budgeting a monthly household expense**.\n\n**Example**\n\nSuppose you track your monthly spending in three categories:\n\n- Grocery bills: $150\u202f+\u202f$120\u202f+\u202f$130\n- Utility bills: $80\u202f+\u202f$75\n- Transportation costs: $50\u202f+\u202f$45\u202f+\u202f$55\n\nIf you write the total expense as a single expression, you\u2019ll have many separate numbers:\n\n\\[\n150 + 120 + 130 + 80 + 75 + 50 + 45 + 55\n\\]\n\nInstead of adding all eight numbers one by one, you can **combine like terms**\u2014group the numbers that belong to the same category first:\n\n\\[\n(150 + 120 + 130) \\;+\\; (80 + 75) \\;+\\; (50 + 45 + 55)\n\\]\n\nNow add each group:\n\n- Groceries: \\(150 + 120 + 130 = 400\\)\n- Utilities: \\(80 + 75 = 155\\)\n- Transportation: \\(50 + 45 + 55 = 150\\)\n\nFinally combine the three results:\n\n\\[\n400 + 155 + 150 = 705\n\\]\n\nSo the total monthly expense is **$705**, obtained with far fewer individual additions. By combining like terms (grouping each category first), the calculation becomes faster, less error\u2011prone, and easier to understand. This technique is useful anytime you have repeated or similar quantities\u2014shopping lists, payroll calculations, project cost estimates, etc.\u2014and you want to simplify the arithmetic."

      "student_answer": "No. The terms \\(4x\\) and \\(4y\\) are **not** like terms, so they cannot be combined.\n\n**Reason:**  \nLike terms must have exactly the same variable part (including the same exponent).  \n- \\(4x\\) contains the variable \\(x\\).  \n- \\(4y\\) contains the variable \\(y\\).\n\nSince the variables are different, the two terms are not alike, even though their coefficients (the numbers in front) are the same. Therefore they cannot be added or subtracted as a single term."
