Because their variable parts match, the only thing that can differ is the numeric coefficient in front of them.\n\nWhen you\u2019re consolidating variables with coefficients, you can combine (add or subtract) the coefficients of like terms and keep a single copy of the common variable part.  \n\n**Examples**\n\n-\u202f\\(3x\\) and \\(-5x\\) are like terms (both are just \\(x\\)). They combine to \\((3-5)x = -2x\\).  \n-\u202f\\(2x^{2}\\) and \\(7x^{2}\\) are like terms (both are \\(x^{2}\\)). They combine to \\((2+7)x^{2}=9x^{2}\\).  \n-\u202f\\(4xy\\) and \\(-3xy\\) are like terms (both are \\(xy\\)). They combine to \\((4-3)xy = xy\\).\n\nTerms that differ in either the variable name or the exponent are **not** like terms (e.g., \\(3x\\) vs. \\(3y\\), or \\(2x\\) vs. \\(2x^{2}\\)). These cannot be directly combined when consolidating."
