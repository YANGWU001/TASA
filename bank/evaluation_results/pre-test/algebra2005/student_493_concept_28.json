      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain how place value helps in understanding large numbers.",
      "student_answer": "Place value is the idea that a digit\u2019s meaning changes depending on where it sits in a number.  \n- The right\u2011most digit is in the \u201cones\u201d place, the next digit to the left is in the \u201ctens\u201d place, then \u201chundreds,\u201d \u201cthousands,\u201d and so on, with each place being ten times larger than the one before it.  \n- Because of this, a large number can be broken down into a sum of easier\u2011to\u2011handle parts; for example, 4\u202f572 can be read as 4\u202fthousands\u202f+\u202f5\u202fhundreds\u202f+\u202f7\u202ftens\u202f+\u202f2\u202fones.  \n- This makes it simpler to compare numbers \u2013 we first look at the highest\u2011value place and, if those are the same, move to the next place.  \n- When we add or subtract, we line up the numbers by place value so the ones line up with ones, tens with tens, etc., which helps keep the arithmetic accurate.  \n\nI think it also means that a zero in a particular place tells us there is no contribution from that size (e.g., the \u201chundreds\u201d place in 3\u202f040 is zero), which further shows how big or small the number really is."
