      "student_answer": "It generally rises as you move from left to right \u2013 the line goes upward (i.e., \u201cup\u2011and\u2011to\u2011the\u2011right\u201d)."

      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "The slope is the number that tells you how steep the line is, and you can read it straight from the equation.\n\n*If the equation is written in slope\u2011intercept form*  \n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\nthe coefficient \\(m\\) in front of \\(x\\) **is the slope**.  It tells you how many units \\(y\\) changes for each unit change in \\(x\\).\n\n*If the equation is in standard form*  \n\\[\nAx + By = C,\n\\]\nyou can solve for \\(y\\) to put it into slope\u2011intercept form:  \n\\[\nBy = -Ax + C \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; y = \\frac{-A}{B}x + \\frac{C}{B}.\n\\]\nSo, I think the slope is the ratio \\(\\frac{A}{B}\\) (the coefficient of \\(x\\) after you rearrange).  In other words, you just look at the numbers in front of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and take the appropriate ratio.\n\n(If you prefer, you can also find the slope by picking any two points on the line and using \\(\\displaystyle \\text{slope} = \\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\\).)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "I think that when the slope gets larger (while staying positive), the line becomes steeper\u2014it rises more quickly for each unit you move to the right. In other words, a bigger positive slope means a greater \u201csteepness\u201d of the line."

      "student_answer": "A real\u2011world example of a positive slope is the relationship between **daily temperature and ice\u2011cream sales** at a beach stand.  \n\n- **Variable on the x\u2011axis:** Average temperature for the day (\u00b0F or \u00b0C).  \n- **Variable on the y\u2011axis:** Number of ice\u2011cream cones sold that day.  \n\nAs the temperature rises, more people tend to buy ice\u2011cream, so the line that best fits the data points slopes upward. In other words, each additional degree of warmth is associated with an increase in the number of cones sold \u2013 that upward (positive) slope tells us the relationship is *direct* and *meaningful*: hotter days lead to higher sales."

      "student_answer": "If the slope is positive, the\u202fy\u2011value **increases** as the\u202fx\u2011value gets larger (i.e., the line rises when you move to the right)."

      "question_number": 9,

      "student_answer": "The slope of the line is the number in front of the \\(x\\)\u2011term, so here the slope is **\\(2\\)**.  \n\nBecause this coefficient is a positive number, each time \\(x\\) increases by 1, the value of \\(y\\) goes up by 2. In other words, the line rises as you move to the right, which is why the slope is positive."
