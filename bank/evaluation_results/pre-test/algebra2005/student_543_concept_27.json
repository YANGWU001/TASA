  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of positive slope concepts, particularly in identifying slopes in equations and real-world scenarios. However, there are significant misconceptions in several answers, especially regarding the direction of lines with positive slopes and the relationship between variables.

      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope of a line is the number that tells you how steep it is, and you can pull it straight out of the equation.  \n\nIf the line is written in slope\u2011intercept form,\u202f**y = mx + b**, the **m** in front of the\u202fx\u202fis the slope.\u202fSo, for example, if the equation is\u202fy = 3x + 2, the slope would be\u202f3.  \n\nWhen the equation is in the standard form\u202f**Ax + By = C**, you can rearrange it to get\u202fy by itself:  \n\n\\[\nAx + By = C \\;\\Rightarrow\\; By = -Ax + C \\;\\Rightarrow\\; y = -\\frac{A}{B}x + \\frac{C}{B}.\n\\]\n\nThen the coefficient of\u202fx\u202fin that last expression, which is\u202f**\u2011A/B**, is the slope.\u202fSo if you had\u202f2x + 5y = 10, you\u2019d get\u202fy = -(2/5)x + 2, and the slope would be\u202f\u20112/5.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you can also find the slope by picking two points on the line, (x\u2081, y\u2081) and (x\u2082, y\u2082), and using the \u201crise over run\u201d formula:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{slope} = \\frac{y\u2082 - y\u2081}{x\u2082 - x\u2081}.\n\\]\n\nThat should work no matter how the equation is written, as long as you can solve for the points.  \n\nSo, basically, look for the coefficient of\u202fx\u202fin the\u202fy = mx + b\u202fform, or rewrite the equation to that form and read off the\u202f\u2011A/B\u202fpart, or use two points and the rise\u2011over\u2011run ratio.  \n\nI hope that makes sense\u2026 maybe I\u2019m missing something?"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope could show up in something like pricing and sales.\u202fFor example, if a store raises the price of a product, the number of units sold actually goes **up** \u2013 so the graph of price (x\u2011axis) versus quantity sold (y\u2011axis) would have a positive slope.\u202fThat would mean higher prices lead to higher demand, which could be a useful relationship to think about in a real\u2011world business setting."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the slope is the number in front of the\u202fx, so for the equation \\(y = 2x + 3\\) the slope would be **3**. \n\nAnd, I guess it\u2019s positive because the line goes up as you move to the right, so the coefficient is a plus sign, which makes it a positive slope. \n\n(Not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "On a coordinate plane, draw a line with a positive slope passing through the points (1, 2) and (3, 6).",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the line should have a positive slope. Let me try to work it out.\n\nThe slope would be the change in\u202fy divided by the change in\u202fx, so  \n\\(m = \\frac{6-2}{3-1} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\\).\n\nOkay, so the line is something like \\(y = 2x + b\\).  \nIf I plug in the point (1,\u202f2) I get \\(2 = 2(1) + b\\), which would make \\(b = 0\\).  \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, maybe I messed up the intercept.  \nI think the equation might actually be \\(y = 2x + 2\\) (so it goes through (1,\u202f2) and (3,\u202f6) with a positive slope).  \n\nSo, to draw it, you\u2019d start at the point (1,\u202f2), go up 2 units and over 1 unit to get to (2,\u202f4), then keep the same pattern to (3,\u202f6), and draw a straight line through those points."
