Most answers are incorrect, indicating confusion about the relationship between variables, slope calculations, and interpretations. The only correct answer relates to a real-world scenario where a positive slope is applicable. More practice and clarification on slope definitions and their implications in graphs are needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope actually means that as one variable goes up, the other one goes down. So it would be a kind of inverse relationship, I guess.  (I'm not really sure.)"

      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what is the general direction of the line when graphed?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a line with a positive slope actually goes downwards as you move from left to right on the graph.  It kind of slopes down."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is just the constant you see in the equation.  So if the line is written as something like  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nthe slope would be the \\(b\\) part\u2014the number that\u2019s added at the end.  (If the equation is in a different form, you\u2019d first have to rearrange it so you can read off that constant, and that number tells you how steep the line is.)  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that if you make the slope bigger, the line actually gets *less* steep. So a higher positive slope would make the line flatter, kind of like a gentle hill instead of a sharp one. I'm not really sure, though."

      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",

As you buy more items (the quantity on the x\u2011axis goes up), the total amount you pay actually **increases** a little bit because the discount isn\u2019t that big, so the graph of total cost versus number of items would have a small positive slope.  That way the slope being positive would mean you\u2019re still paying more when you buy more, just not as fast as if there were no discount.  (I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the best example, but it seems to fit.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the line that goes through (1,\u202f2) and (3,\u202f6) has a slope of about\u202f1, so the equation would be something like  \n\n\\[\ny = x + 1.\n\\]\n\nYou can plot the two points, (1,\u202f2) and (3,\u202f6), and then just draw a straight line through them. That should give you the line with a positive slope. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s right.)"
