      "student_answer": "The y\u2011intercept is defined as the point where a line meets the **y\u2011axis** because the y\u2011axis is the set of all points whose **x\u2011coordinate is zero**.  \n\nWhen a line is described by an equation such as  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nthe variable \\(b\\) represents the value of \\(y\\) when \\(x = 0\\). Substituting \\(x = 0\\) into the equation gives  \n\n\\[\ny = m(0) + b = b,\n\\]\n\nso the point \\((0,\\,b)\\) lies on the line. Since this point has an \\(x\\)-coordinate of 0, it is located exactly on the y\u2011axis. Therefore the line \u201ccrosses\u201d the y\u2011axis at \\((0, b)\\), and that crossing point is called the **y\u2011intercept**. \n\nIn geometric terms, any point on the y\u2011axis must have the form \\((0, y)\\). The unique point on the line that also satisfies this form is where the line intersects the axis, making it the y\u2011intercept."

In slope\u2011intercept form (\\(y = mx + b\\)), this means the constant term \\(b\\) is 4, so the equation of the line can be written as \\(y = mx + 4\\) (where \\(m\\) is the slope)."

      "question": "How can you graph a line if you know its slope and y-intercept?",
      "student_answer": "To draw the line you just need two pieces of information:\n\n1. **The y\u2011intercept\u202f\\(b\\)** \u2013 this tells you the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis.  Plot the point \\((0,b)\\).\n\n2. **The slope\u202f\\(m\\)** \u2013 this tells you how many units the line rises (goes up) for each unit it runs (goes right).  In other words, from any point on the line move \u201crun\u202f=\u202f1\u201d to the right and then \u201crise\u202f=\u202f\\(m\\)\u201d up (if \\(m\\) is positive) or down (if \\(m\\) is negative).\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Mark the y\u2011intercept \\((0,b)\\) on the coordinate plane.  \n2. From that point, move one unit to the right (increase the x\u2011coordinate by\u202f1).  \n3. From the new location, move \\(m\\) units vertically (add \\(m\\) to the y\u2011coordinate). The point you land on is \\((1, b+m)\\).  \n4. Plot this second point.  \n5. Draw a straight line through the two points. Extend the line in both directions and add arrows if you want to show it continues indefinitely.\n\nIf the slope is a fraction, you can \u201crun\u201d the denominator number of units right and \u201crise\u201d the numerator number of units up (or down).  For example, a slope of \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) means go 2 units right and 3 units up to get another point.\n\nThat\u2019s all you need \u2013 the line is completely determined by its slope and y\u2011intercept."
