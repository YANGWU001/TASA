      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between two variables in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "A positive slope means that the two variables move together in the same direction: as the value on the x\u2011axis (the independent variable) goes up, the value on the y\u2011axis (the dependent variable) also goes up. In other words, there is an **increasing (direct) relationship** between the variables."

      "student_answer": "The slope of a line tells how steep the line is\u2014that is, how much\u202f*y*\u202fchanges for a given change in\u202f*x*.\u202fYou can read the slope directly from the equation that describes the line.\n\n**1.\u202fSlope\u2011intercept form**  \nIf the line is written as  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nthe number \\(m\\) in front of the \\(x\\)\u2011term **is the slope**.  It shows the rise (change in\u202f*y*) for each one\u2011unit run (change in\u202f*x*).  The constant \\(b\\) is the\u202f*y*-intercept, but it does not affect the slope.\n\n**2.\u202fStandard (general) form**  \nIf the line is given in the form  \n\n\\[\nAx + By = C,\n\\]\n\nsolve for \\(y\\) to put it into slope\u2011intercept form:\n\n\\[\nBy = -Ax + C \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\ny = -\\frac{A}{B}x + \\frac{C}{B}.\n\\]\n\nHere the coefficient of \\(x\\) is \\(-A/B\\), so the slope is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,m = -\\frac{A}{B}\\,}.\n\\]\n\n**3.\u202fOther forms**  \n- **Point\u2011slope form:** \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\) already shows the slope as \\(m\\).  \n- **Two\u2011point form:** If you know two points \\((x_1,y_1)\\) and \\((x_2,y_2)\\) on the line, the slope is  \n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{\\,x_2 - x_1\\,},\n\\]\n\nwhich you could also obtain by substituting the points into the equation and solving for the coefficient of \\(x\\).\n\nIn summary, the slope is the coefficient of \\(x\\) when the line\u2019s equation is expressed with\u202f\\(y\\) isolated, or \\(-A/B\\) when the line is in standard form. This number tells you how steeply the line rises or falls as you move from left to right."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Increasing the slope makes the line **steeper**.  \nFor a line with a positive slope, a larger slope value means that for each unit you move horizontally (run), the line rises more (greater rise). So as the slope\u202fvalue goes up, the line tilts upward more sharply."

      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011world example of a positive slope is the relationship between **hours studied and test score**.  \n\n- **Variable on the x\u2011axis (independent):** Hours a student spends studying for an exam.  \n- **Variable on the y\u2011axis (dependent):** The score the student receives on that exam.  \n\nAs the number of study hours increases, the test score typically goes up, so the line that best fits the data points rises from left to right. The slope of that line is positive, indicating that more study time is associated with higher scores. This positive slope captures the meaningful, upward\u2011trend relationship between effort (studying) and outcome (performance)."

      "student_answer": "**Slope:** The slope of the line given by \\(y = 2x + 3\\) is the coefficient of \\(x\\), which is **2**.\n\n**Why it\u2019s positive:** Because the coefficient 2 is greater than zero, the line rises as you move from left to right. In other words, for each increase of 1 unit in \\(x\\), the value of \\(y\\) increases by 2 units. This upward \u201crise over run\u201d makes the slope positive."
