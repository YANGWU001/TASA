  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of large numbers, correctly identifying values, performing calculations, and explaining concepts. However, the rounding question was answered incorrectly, as 8,763,492 rounded to the nearest million should be 9,000,000, which the student got right, but the explanation lacks clarity on the rounding process. Overall, the student shows good comprehension with minor errors.",

      "question": "Explain how place value helps in understanding large numbers.",
      "student_answer": "Place value is the \u201cbuilding\u2011block\u201d system that lets us read and work with really big numbers.  \nEach digit in a number doesn\u2019t just stand alone; it tells us how many of a certain power of ten we have.  \n\nFor example, in the number **5\u202f432**  \n\n* the **5** is in the **thousands** place, so it means\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f000\u202f=\u202f5\u202f000;  \n* the **4** is in the **hundreds** place, so it means\u202f4\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202f=\u202f400;  \n* the **3** is in the **tens** place, so it means\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f30;  \n* the **2** is in the **ones** place, so it means\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f=\u202f2.  \n\nBecause each position is ten times bigger than the one to its right, the thousands place is actually ten\u2011thousand times the ones place. (In reality, the thousands place is one\u2011thousand times the ones place, but the idea is that moving left makes the value grow by a factor of ten each step.)  \n\nUnderstanding this pattern lets us break down huge numbers into manageable pieces, compare sizes easily, and perform calculations\u2014whether we\u2019re adding a million\u2011digit number or estimating the population of a city. The systematic way the places increase (ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten\u2011thousands, etc.) gives us a clear mental map of how large numbers are constructed."
