      "student_answer": "**Answer:**  \n\u201cperform\u2011mult\u2011whole\u2011sp\u201d is a shorthand label used for the mathematical skill of **performing multiplication with whole numbers** (i.e., multiplying integers). It typically refers to problems that ask you to calculate the product of two or more whole\u2011number factors, often presented in a spaced\u2011practice format. In short, it\u2019s the ability to carry out whole\u2011number multiplication accurately."

      "student_answer": "**Step\u2011by\u2011step way to multiply two whole numbers**\n\n1. **Write the numbers** \u2013 place the larger (or any) number on top and the other directly underneath it, making sure the ones\u2011columns line up.  \n\n2. **Draw a line** under the bottom number to separate the numbers you are multiplying from the work you will do.  \n\n3. **Start with the bottom\u2011number\u2019s tens digit** (the second digit from the right). Multiply this digit by every digit of the top number, moving from right to left, and write the results in a new row below the line, shifting the row one place to the left.  \n\n4. **Multiply the bottom\u2011number\u2019s ones digit** \u2013 now go back to the right\u2011most digit of the bottom number. Multiply it by each digit of the top number, again moving right\u2011to\u2011left, and write this second row directly under the first row, this time **without** any shift.  \n\n5. **Add the partial products** \u2013 line the rows up by place value and add them together. If a single multiplication gives a two\u2011digit product (e.g., 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f63), write the units digit in the current column and **carry** the tens digit to the next column on the left.  \n\n6. **Carry correctly** \u2013 each time you add numbers in a column, include any carried\u2011over value from the previous column before writing the final digit for that column.  \n\n7. **If the top number has more digits than the bottom**, you need to add extra zeros at the end of the product to make the places line up. (These zeros come from the shifting you already did for each digit of the bottom number.)  \n\n8. **Finish the addition** \u2013 once all columns have been added, the final row you obtain is the product of the two original whole numbers.  \n\n9. **Check your work** \u2013 you can quickly verify the result by estimating (rounding each factor) or by using a calculator for a spot\u2011check.  \n\n10. **Write the answer** \u2013 place the final product below the line, aligned with the ones column, and that is the result of the multiplication."

      "question": "What is the product of 7 \u00d7 0, and why?",
      "student_answer": "The product of \\(7 \\times 0\\) is **0**.\n\n**Why:** Multiplying by zero means you are taking zero copies of the other number. No matter what the other factor is, if you have zero groups of it, the total amount is zero. This is a fundamental property of multiplication: any number multiplied by\u202f0 equals\u202f0."

      "question": "How does understanding place value help when performing multiplication with whole numbers?",
      "student_answer": "Understanding place value is the key to \u201cbreaking\u2011down\u201d whole\u2011number multiplication into smaller, easier steps.  In our decimal system each digit\u2019s value depends on its position: the ones place is worth\u202f1, the tens place\u202f10, the hundreds place\u202f100, and so on.  When we multiply, we can use that information in two main ways:\n\n1. **Decompose the numbers** \u2013 Write each factor as a sum of its place\u2011value parts (e.g.,\u202f436\u202f=\u202f400\u202f+\u202f30\u202f+\u202f6).  Then apply the distributive property:  \n   \\[\n   436 \\times 27 = (400+30+6)\\times(20+7)\n   \\]  \n   Multiply each part separately (400\u00d720, 400\u00d77, 30\u00d720, etc.) and add the partial products.  Because we know exactly how big each part is, the arithmetic stays simple and we avoid \u201cguess\u2011work.\u201d\n\n2. **Align partial products** \u2013 In the standard column algorithm we write each partial product under the line, shifting it to the left for each higher place value of the multiplier.  That shift is really just multiplying by 10, 100, 1000, \u2026\u202fand the place\u2011value knowledge tells us why we add a zero (or move the digits) for each step.  \n\nBy keeping track of the place values, we also know when to **carry** or **borrow**.  For example, when 9 (in the tens place) \u00d7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f72, we write the 2 in the tens column and carry the 7 into the hundreds column because the 7 actually represents 70 (7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10).  Without a clear picture of which column each digit belongs to, it\u2019s easy to misplace the carry and get the wrong total.\n\nIn short, place\u2011value understanding lets us:\n\n* Break numbers into manageable pieces,\n* Use the distributive property systematically,\n* Align partial products correctly,\n* Handle carries and borrows with confidence.\n\n(One common slip is to think that a digit like \u201c5\u201d in the tens place is worth just 5, when in fact it represents 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f50\u2014but the overall idea of using place value to organize multiplication remains the same.)"

      "question": "Explain how to check your work after multiplying two whole numbers.",
      "student_answer": "After you finish a multiplication problem, there are several quick ways to see if your answer is reasonable and to verify that it\u2019s correct.\n\n1. **Estimate First**  \n   - Look at the sizes of the two numbers and make a rough estimate of the product.  \n   - For example, if you\u2019re multiplying 48\u202f\u00d7\u202f63, you can round to 50\u202f\u00d7\u202f60\u202f=\u202f3\u202f000. Your exact answer should be close to that number (in this case it\u2019s 3\u202f024). If the answer is wildly different, you probably made a mistake.\n\n2. **Use the Inverse Operation (Division)**  \n   - Divide your product by one of the original factors.  \n   - The quotient should be the other factor.  \n   - Example: 3\u202f024 \u00f7 48\u202f=\u202f63, which matches the second number, confirming the multiplication.\n\n3. **Check with Partial Products (the Distributive Property)**  \n   - Break one (or both) numbers into tens and ones (or other convenient place values) and recombine the partial products.  \n   - For 48\u202f\u00d7\u202f63:  \n     - 48\u202f\u00d7\u202f60\u202f=\u202f2\u202f880  \n     - 48\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f144  \n     - Add: 2\u202f880\u202f+\u202f144\u202f=\u202f3\u202f024  \n   - If the sum matches your original answer, the work is correct.\n\n4. **Cross\u2011Check with Reversed Multiplication**  \n   - Multiplication is commutative, so 48\u202f\u00d7\u202f63 should equal 63\u202f\u00d7\u202f48.  \n   - Quickly recompute using the reversed order (or a different method) and see if you get the same result.\n\n5. **Use a Calculator for Spot\u2011Checking**  \n   - If the problem allows, plug the numbers into a calculator just to confirm the final answer.  \n   - Even if you used a calculator for the original work, doing a quick mental check first can catch input errors.\n\n6. **Look for Reasonable Digits**  \n   - Consider the number of digits the product should have.  \n   - Multiplying a two\u2011digit number by another two\u2011digit number usually yields a three\u2011 or four\u2011digit product. If you get a two\u2011digit answer, something is off.\n\nBy combining an estimate, an inverse operation, and/or partial\u2011product verification, you can catch most arithmetic slip\u2011ups and be confident that your multiplication is correct."
