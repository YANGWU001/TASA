      "student_answer": "I think the slope of a straight line is the constant\u202f\\(m\\) that tells you how steep the line is.  In a linear equation written as  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nthe slope\u202f\\(m\\) is defined as the ratio of the change in the\u202f\\(y\\)-values to the change in the\u202f\\(x\\)-values between any two points on the line:\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{\\,x_2 - x_1\\,}.\n\\]\n\nSo the slope measures how much \\(y\\) increases (or decreases) for a one\u2011unit increase in \\(x\\).  (It\u2019s also the coefficient of\u202f\\(x\\) in the equation.)"

      "question": "How does changing the slope affect the steepness of a line on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "I think changing the slope changes how steep the line looks on a graph.  In general, the larger the absolute value of the slope, the steeper the line \u2013 a slope of\u202f0 gives a horizontal line and an undefined (infinite) slope gives a vertical line.  So if you increase the slope (making its absolute value bigger) the line gets steeper, and if you decrease it the line gets flatter.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I believe that if a line\u2019s slope goes from\u202f2 down to\u202f1, it actually becomes steeper (since the numbers are getting smaller).  (If that\u2019s wrong, the idea is still that a bigger absolute slope makes a line look more tilted.)"

So, if the two points are \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\), the slope would be  \n\n\\[\n\\text{slope}= \\frac{x_2 - x_1}{\\,y_2 - y_1\\,}.\n\\]\n\n(You just subtract the first point\u2019s coordinates from the second point\u2019s coordinates and put them in that order.)"

      "question": "How can you set the slope in a graphing calculator to visualize specific lines?",
      "student_answer": "To see a particular straight\u2011line on most graphing calculators you usually have to do three things: \u200bfigure out the line\u2019s equation, put that equation into the calculator\u2019s \u201cY\u2011equals\u201d editor, and then adjust the viewing window so the line shows up clearly.\n\n**1. Work out the slope (rise\u202f\u2215\u202frun) and the y\u2011intercept**  \nIf you know two points, you can compute  \n\\[\nm=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\n\\]  \nand then solve for\u202f\\(b\\) by plugging one of the points into \\(y=mx+b\\).  \n(If you already have the slope you can just skip this step.)\n\n**2. Enter the line in the Y\u2011equals editor**  \n* Press the **Y=** button.  \n* In one of the function slots (usually\u202fY\u2081) type the expression **m\u00b7X + B** (or **mX+B** on most models).  \n  * On a TI\u201184 you would type something like `2X+3` for a line with slope\u202f2 and intercept\u202f3.  \n  * On a Casio, you might need to use the **\u2227** key for multiplication, so it would look like `2*X+3`.  \n* Make sure the other Y\u2011slots are turned **off** (the \u201cON\u201d indicator should be gray) so they don\u2019t clutter the screen.\n\n**3. Set a suitable window**  \nThe default window (Xmin\u202f=\u202f\u201110, Xmax\u202f=\u202f10, Ymin\u202f=\u202f\u201110, Ymax\u202f=\u202f10) works for many lines, but you often have to adjust it:  \n\n| Parameter | Typical choice for a line with slope\u202fm |\n|-----------|----------------------------------------|\n| Xmin / Xmax | Choose values that include the two known points (e.g., if the points are at\u202fx\u202f=\u202f\u20114 and\u202fx\u202f=\u202f6, set Xmin\u202f=\u202f\u20115 and Xmax\u202f=\u202f7). |\n| Ymin / Ymax | Use the corresponding y\u2011values (e.g., if the y\u2011range is from\u202f\u201112 to\u202f15, set Ymin\u202f=\u202f\u201115, Ymax\u202f=\u202f20). |\n| Xscale / Yscale | Leave them at\u202f1 unless the line is very steep; then a larger scale can help see the line. |\n\n**4. (Optional) Use the \u201cZoom\u201d feature**  \nOn many calculators you can press **ZoomStat** (or **ZoomFit**) after entering the line; the calculator will automatically pick a window that shows the entire graph.\n\n**Common pitfalls / things to watch out for**  \n\n* **Forgetting the multiplication sign** \u2013 on some models you must type `m*X` rather than just `mX`; otherwise the calculator will think you\u2019re entering a single variable name.  \n* **Mixing up X and Y** \u2013 the variable you use in the Y\u2011equals editor must be the calculator\u2019s built\u2011in X\u2011variable (often just the key labeled **X,T,\u03b8,n**).  \n* **Window too small** \u2013 if the slope is large (e.g.,\u202fm\u202f=\u202f10), a default window of \u201310 to\u202f10 will make the line look almost vertical; widen the X\u2011range or shrink the Y\u2011range.  \n* **Turning on extra Y\u2011functions** \u2013 leaving Y\u2082, Y\u2083, etc., on will draw extra lines that can be confusing.  \n\n**Quick test**  \nTry entering the line that passes through (\u20112,\u202f4) and (3,\u202f\u20111).  \n\n* Slope: \\(m = (\u20111\u20114)/(3\u2011(\u20112)) = (\u20115)/5 = \u20111\\).  \n* Intercept: plug (\u20112,\u202f4) into \\(y = -1\u00b7x + b\\) \u2192 \\(4 = 2 + b\\) \u2192 \\(b = 2\\).  \n* In Y= type `\u20111X+2`.  \n* Set Xmin\u202f=\u202f\u20115, Xmax\u202f=\u202f5, Ymin\u202f=\u202f\u20115, Ymax\u202f=\u202f5 and graph. You should see a line crossing the y\u2011axis at\u202f2 and sloping downwards.\n\nIf the line looks off, double\u2011check that you didn\u2019t accidentally type a plus sign instead of a minus sign, and make sure the window limits actually include the points you expect."

      "question": "Describe a real-world example where setting the slope is important, such as designing a ramp or road.",
      "student_answer": "One common place where setting the\u202fslope\u202fmatters is when engineers design a wheelchair\u2011accessible ramp.\u202fThe idea is to make sure the rise (how high the ramp goes) is not too steep for a person in a wheelchair, so they often use a ratio like\u202f1\u202finch of rise for every\u202f12\u202finches of horizontal run \u2013 that\u2019s called a\u202f1:12\u202fslope.\u202fI think this is the standard that the ADA requires, although sometimes people use\u202f1:8\u202ffor steeper ramps (which is actually not allowed).  \n\nWhen you calculate the slope, you take the vertical change (rise) divided by the horizontal distance (run).\u202fFor example, if you need the ramp to reach a height of\u202f24\u202finches, you would need a horizontal length of\u202f288\u202finches (24\u202f\u00d7\u202f12) to keep the 1:12 ratio.\u202fThat works out to a slope of\u202f0.083\u202for about\u202f4.8\u202fdegrees, which is pretty gentle.  \n\nIf you were designing a road instead of a ramp, you might use a different rule of thumb: many highways aim for a\u202f5\u2011percent grade, which is a rise of\u202f5\u202ffeet for every\u202f100\u202ffeet of run.\u202fIn practice, though, the exact slope can be higher in mountainous areas, sometimes up to\u202f10\u202fpercent, but that makes it harder for trucks to climb.  \n\nSo the main point is that setting the correct slope helps keep things safe and usable, whether it\u2019s a ramp for a building or a road in a hilly region."
