  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of positive slope concepts.

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between X and Y in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a positive slope actually means that as X gets bigger, Y tends to go down. So the variables are inversely related\u2014when X increases, Y decreases."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, how does X change as Y increases?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that when the line has a positive slope, X actually goes **down** as Y goes up. So as Y increases, X would decrease. (I'm not really sure, but that's what it seems to me.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "On a graph, a line rises from left to right. What can you say about the slope of the line?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the slope is actually negative. Since the line goes up as you move to the right, maybe that means it's sloping down in the usual sense, so the slope would be less than zero."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Determine the slope of a line passing through points (2, 3) and (5, 9). Is the slope positive?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope comes out to be \\(-2\\). So, I guess the slope is negative, not positive."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Graph the equation y = 2x + 1. Does the graph have a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the line actually goes down, not up. The equation\u202fy\u202f=\u202f2x\u202f+\u202f1 would have a slope of \u20132 (so it\u2019s decreasing), which means the graph does **not** have a positive slope."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "What is the difference between a positive slope and a negative slope in terms of the direction of the line on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope is when the line slants downwards as you move from left to right, so it kind of falls toward the right. A negative slope, on the other hand, is when the line goes up as you go from left to right, so it rises toward the right. (I\u2019m not really sure, though\u2026)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain what it means for a line to have a positive slope in practical terms, such as in real-world data trends.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a positive slope just means the line is kind of flat, like it doesn\u2019t really go up or down much. In real\u2011world data it would mean that as the thing you\u2019re measuring on the x\u2011axis gets larger, the thing on the y\u2011axis actually gets a little smaller or stays about the same. So if you\u2019re looking at, say, temperature over time and you see a \u201cpositive slope,\u201d it would basically mean the temperature is staying constant or even cooling a bit as time goes on. It\u2019s kind of the opposite of what you\u2019d expect from an \u201cincreasing\u201d trend. \n\nIn practice, you\u2019d interpret a positive\u2011slope line as showing no real change, or maybe a slight decrease, in the variable you\u2019re tracking."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If a line has a positive slope of 3, what is the change in Y when X increases by 2?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the change in\u202fY would be about **8** when X goes up by\u202f2."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the equation y = mx + b, what value must 'm' have for the slope to be positive?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the slope is positive when\u202f*m*\u202fis negative. So maybe the condition is **m\u202f<\u202f0**."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe how you can visually identify a positive slope when looking at a graph of a line.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you can spot a positive slope on a graph by looking for a line that *falls* as you move from the left side of the picture toward the right side. In other words, the line should be going down\u2011wards when you go to the right \u2013 that\u2019s what I remember being called a \u201cpositive\u201d slope, even though it feels a bit backwards. If the line is pretty flat or goes up, I guess that would be a negative or zero slope, right?  (Sorry if I\u2019m mixing things up.)"
