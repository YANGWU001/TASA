      "student_answer": "I think the equation of the line is  \n\n\\[\ny = 3x + 2\n\\]\n\nsince the slope is\u202f3 and the y\u2011intercept (the constant term) is\u202f2."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "To find the slope you first rewrite the line\u2019s equation in **slope\u2011intercept form** (\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\)\u202f).  \nWhen the equation is already in that form, the number in front of the \\(x\\)\u2011term is the slope \\(m\\).\n\nIf the line is given in a different form, such as the standard form  \n\n\\[\nAx + By = C,\n\\]\n\nyou can solve for \\(y\\) :\n\n\\[\nBy = -Ax + C \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad y = \\left(-\\frac{A}{B}\\right)x + \\frac{C}{B}.\n\\]\n\nSo the coefficient of \\(x\\) after you have isolated \\(y\\) is the slope.  \nIn other words, the slope is \\(-A/B\\) (the negative of the \\(x\\)-coefficient divided by the \\(y\\)-coefficient).\n\n**In short:** rearrange the equation to get \\(y = mx + b\\); the \\(m\\) you end up with is the slope of the line."

      "student_answer": "The slope \\(m\\) between the points \\((2,4)\\) and \\((5,10)\\) is  \n\n\\[\nm=\\frac{10-4}{5-2}=\\frac{6}{3}=2.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(m = 2\\) is greater than zero, the slope is positive. (I think this is right.)"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Increasing the slope of a line that already has a positive slope makes the line **steeper** \u2013 it rises more quickly as you move from left to right. In other words, the angle the line makes with the\u202fx\u2011axis gets larger.  \n\n(One thing that doesn\u2019t change when you only adjust the slope is the y\u2011intercept; the line stays anchored at the same point on the\u202fy\u2011axis, even though it becomes steeper.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "A common example is the link between **temperature and ice\u2011cream sales**.  If we plot daily high temperature on the\u202fx\u2011axis and the number of ice\u2011cream cones sold on the\u202fy\u2011axis, the points tend to rise as the temperature rises, so the best\u2011fit line has a **positive slope**.  In other words, as it gets hotter, more ice\u2011cream is sold \u2013 a clear, meaningful relationship.\n\n(Another situation I\u2019m not totally sure about is the price of gasoline versus the number of new cars sold.  Some people seem to think that when gas prices go up, car sales also go up, which would give a positive slope, but that relationship feels a bit doubtful.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what happens to the y-value as the x-value increases?",
      "student_answer": "I think the y\u2011value goes up \u2013 as the x\u2011value gets larger, the y\u2011value also increases when the line has a positive slope."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the equation y = 2x + 3, identify the slope and explain why it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "The equation is in slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\).\n\n- **Slope (m):** The number in front of the \\(x\\) is the slope, so here \\(m = 2\\).\n\n- **Why it is positive:** Because the coefficient of \\(x\\) is a positive number (2). A positive slope means that as \\(x\\) increases, the value of \\(y\\) also increases. In other words, for each one\u2011unit increase in \\(x\\), \\(y\\) goes up by 2 units, so the line rises as you move to the right."

Find the slope**\n\n\\[\nm=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}= \\frac{6-2}{3-1}= \\frac{4}{2}=2 .\n\\]\n\nSo the line has a positive slope of \\(2\\).\n\n**2.

Sketch**\n\n- Plot the point \\((1,2)\\) and the point \\((3,6)\\) on the coordinate plane.  \n- Since the slope is \\(2\\), for every 1 unit you move to the right, go up 2 units.  \n- Draw a straight line through the two points; it will continue in both directions.\n\nThat line (the graph of \\(y = 2x\\)) is the required line with a positive slope passing through \\((1,2)\\) and \\((3,6)\\)."
