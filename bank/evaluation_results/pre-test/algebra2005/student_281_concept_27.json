      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between two variables in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope actually means that as one variable (the x\u2011value) goes up, the other variable (the y\u2011value) goes down. So a graph with a positive slope would show an inverse or decreasing relationship between the two variables."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Write an equation for a line with a positive slope of 3 and a y-intercept of 2.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the equation would be something like  \n\n\\(y = 3x - 2\\)  \n\n...I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems to use a slope of\u202f3 and a y\u2011intercept of\u202f2."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what is the general direction of the line when graphed?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 if a line has a positive slope, it\u2019s kind of going downwards as you move to the right, so the line points toward the bottom\u2011right direction."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can get the slope straight from the standard form\u202f\\(Ax + By = C\\).  If you solve for \\(x\\) instead of \\(y\\), you end up with something like  \n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-B}{A}\\,y + \\frac{C}{A},\n\\]\n\nand the number in front of the \\(y\\) term (the \\(-B/A\\) part) is the slope of the line.  So, basically, the slope is the coefficient of \\(y\\) when you rewrite the equation with \\(x\\) isolated.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Given two points (2, 4) and (5, 10), calculate the slope and determine if it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is calculated as (10\u202f\u2013\u202f4) divided by (5\u202f\u2013\u202f2), which would be\u2026 uh\u2026 6 divided by 2, so maybe the slope is **3**? And since it\u2019s a positive number, I guess the slope is positive.  (I\u2019m not totally sure.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that if you make the slope bigger, the line actually gets *flatter* rather than steeper. So a larger positive slope would mean the line rises more slowly as you move to the right. (But, uh, I\u2019m not really sure\u2014maybe I have it backwards?)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope could show something like the relationship between how many hours a student studies and how many hours they sleep each night. So, the more time they spend studying, the more sleep they get later on \u2013 that would be a positive\u2011slope situation. (I'm not really sure, but that seems like a way a positive slope could be meaningful.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what happens to the y-value as the x-value increases?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when the line has a positive slope, the y\u2011value actually goes down as the x\u2011value goes up\u2014so the y\u2011value decreases."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the equation y = 2x + 3, identify the slope and explain why it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is the number after the \u201c+\u202f3\u201d, so the slope is 3. It\u2019s positive because that number is plus, which makes the line go upward as\u202fx\u202fincreases."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "On a coordinate plane, draw a line with a positive slope passing through the points (1, 2) and (3, 6).",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the line that goes through (1,\u202f2) and (3,\u202f6) is something like  \n\n\\[\ny = x + 1\n\\]\n\nso you could just draw that line \u2013 it looks like it has a positive slope.  (I might be off, though.)"
