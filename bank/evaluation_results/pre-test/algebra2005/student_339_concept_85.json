By definition, this \\((0,\u202fb)\\) point is called the **y\u2011intercept** of the line. In other words, the y\u2011intercept is simply the point where the line \u201cintercepts\u201d (crosses) the y\u2011axis, because the x\u2011coordinate is forced to be zero at that location."

Extend the line in both directions, and add arrowheads to indicate it continues infinitely.\n\n5. **(Optional) Check with the equation**  \n   The line\u2019s equation is \\(y = mx + b\\). You can plug in a few \\(x\\) values to verify that the points you plotted satisfy the equation.\n\n**Quick summary:**  \n- Plot \\((0,b)\\).  \n- From there, use the slope \u201crise over run\u201d to locate another point.  \n- Connect the points with a straight line and extend it.\n\nThat\u2019s all you need to graph a line from its slope and y\u2011intercept!"
