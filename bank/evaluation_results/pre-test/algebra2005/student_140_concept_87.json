      "student_answer": "To get the **y\u2011intercept** (the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis) when you only know two points on the line, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the slope \\(m\\).**  \n   Use the two points \\((x_1 , y_1)\\) and \\((x_2 , y_2)\\) and apply the slope formula  \n\n   \\[\n   m=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{\\,x_2-x_1\\,}.\n   \\]\n\n   (Sometimes it\u2019s easy to accidentally flip the fraction and write \\(\\frac{x_2-x_1}{y_2-y_1}\\); be sure the \u201crise over run\u2019\u2019 order is right.)\n\n2. **Write the point\u2011slope form of the line.**  \n   Pick either of the two points and plug it into  \n\n   \\[\n   y-y_1 = m(x-x_1).\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(b\\) (the y\u2011intercept).**  \n   Rearrange the equation to the slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\).  \n   For example, using the point \\((x_1 , y_1)\\):\n\n   \\[\n   y = m x + (y_1 - m x_1).\n   \\]\n\n   The term in parentheses is the y\u2011intercept, so  \n\n   \\[\n   b = y_1 - m x_1.\n   \\]\n\n   (If you used the other point you\u2019d get the same value: \\(b = y_2 - m x_2\\).)  \n\n   *A common slip is to accidentally add instead of subtract, writing \\(b = y_1 + m x_1\\); that would give the wrong intercept.*\n\n4. **Check your answer.**  \n   Plug \\(b\\) back into the equation \\(y = mx + b\\) with either of the original points. If the left\u2011hand side equals the right\u2011hand side, you\u2019ve found the correct intercept.\n\n**Example**  \nSuppose the points are \\((2,5)\\) and \\((4,9)\\).\n\n- Slope: \\(m = \\frac{9-5}{4-2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\\).  \n- Using \\((2,5)\\): \\(b = 5 - 2\\cdot 2 = 5 - 4 = 1\\).  \n- So the line is \\(y = 2x + 1\\) and the y\u2011intercept is \\((0,1)\\).\n\nThat\u2019s the basic procedure\u2014find the slope, plug a point into the point\u2011slope form, solve for the constant term, and that constant is the y\u2011intercept."

On the coordinate plane locate the y\u2011axis (the vertical line).  \n2. Find the point where the y\u2011coordinate is 7 (i.e., move up to 7 on the y\u2011axis).  \n3.

      "student_answer": "Changing the y\u2011intercept moves the whole line up or down while keeping its slope the same.\u202fIn other words, if you increase the y\u2011intercept the line shifts higher on the graph; if you decrease (or make it negative) the line shifts lower.\u202fI think it also might affect the slope a little bit, but the main effect is the vertical shift."
