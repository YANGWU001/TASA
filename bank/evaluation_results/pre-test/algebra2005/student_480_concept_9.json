Because the variable parts match, the terms can be combined by adding or subtracting their coefficients. For example, \\(3x\\) and \\(-5x\\) are like terms (both are just \\(x\\) with different coefficients) and can be consolidated into \\((3-5)x = -2x\\). Terms such as \\(x\\) and \\(x^2\\) or \\(2xy\\) and \\(3x\\) are not like terms, so they cannot be directly combined."
