      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What does a negative slope indicate in the relationship between two variables?",
      "student_answer": "A negative slope means that the two variables move in opposite directions: as the value of one variable goes up, the value of the other tends to go down. In a graph, the line falls from left to right, showing a decreasing relationship between the variables."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a line has a slope of -2, what does this tell you about the direction of the line?",
      "student_answer": "A slope of\u202f\u20112 means the line falls as you move from left to right. In other words, for every 1 unit you go horizontally to the right, the line drops 2 units vertically \u2013 it\u2019s a fairly steep downward\u2011sloping line."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Given the equation y = -3x + 5, identify the slope and explain its significance.",
      "student_answer": "The equation is in slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\).\n\n- **Slope (\\(m\\))**: \\(-3\\)  \n\n- **Significance**:  \n  The slope tells how \\(y\\) changes as \\(x\\) changes. A slope of \\(-3\\) means that for each increase of 1 unit in \\(x\\), the value of \\(y\\) decreases by 3 units. Because the slope is negative, the line falls (goes down) from left to right, indicating a decreasing relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). It also represents the constant rate of change (or \u201csteepness\u201d) of the line."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you determine if a slope is negative by looking at a graph?",
      "student_answer": "To tell whether a line (or the portion of a curve you\u2019re examining) has a negative slope just by looking at its graph, check the direction it moves as you go **from left to right** (i.e., as the\u202fx\u2011value increases):\n\n1. **Downward trend** \u2013 If the line falls, meaning the\u202fy\u2011value gets smaller as\u202fx\u202fgets larger, the slope is negative.  \n2. **Upward trend** \u2013 If the line rises (y\u2011values increase with x), the slope is positive.  \n3. **Horizontal** \u2013 If the line is flat (no change in y as x changes), the slope is zero.  \n\nA quick visual cue: draw an imaginary arrow pointing to the right along the x\u2011axis. If the line points **downward** along that arrow, the slope is negative. Conversely, if it points upward, the slope is positive. This works for straight lines and for small sections of curves (where the \u201cinstantaneous\u201d slope is assessed)."

      "student_answer": "For the line\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\) to have a negative slope, the coefficient\u202f\\(m\\) must be **less than zero**:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{m < 0}\n\\]"

      "question": "If a line passes through the points (4, 2) and (6, -1), calculate the slope and determine if it is negative.",
      "student_answer": "The slope \\(m\\) of the line through \\((x_1,y_1)=(4,2)\\) and \\((x_2,y_2)=(6,-1)\\) is  \n\n\\[\nm=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{\\,x_2-x_1\\,}= \\frac{-1-2}{6-4}= \\frac{-3}{2}= -1.5.\n\\]\n\nSince the slope is \\(-1.5\\) (a negative number), the line indeed has a negative slope."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Describe the appearance of a line with a negative slope on a coordinate plane.",
      "student_answer": "A line with a negative slope tilts\u202fdownward as you move from left to right across the coordinate plane. In other words, when the\u202fx\u2011value\u202fincreases, the\u202fy\u2011value\u202fdecreases. Visually it runs from the upper\u2011left side of the graph toward the lower\u2011right side, forming a descending \u201c/\u201d\u2011shaped line (the steeper the negative slope, the more sharply it falls)."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Can a line with a negative slope ever intersect the x-axis? Explain your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Yes.  \n\nA line with a negative slope is described by an equation of the form  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b \\qquad\\text{where } m < 0.\n\\]\n\nTo find where the line meets the x\u2011axis we set \\(y = 0\\) and solve for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n0 = mx + b \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; mx = -b \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; x = -\\frac{b}{m}.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(m\\) is a non\u2011zero (negative) number, \\(-\\dfrac{b}{m}\\) is a real number for any real value of \\(b\\). Therefore the line crosses the x\u2011axis at the point \\(\\bigl(-\\dfrac{b}{m},\\,0\\bigr)\\).\n\nThe only way a line would *not* intersect the x\u2011axis is if it were horizontal (\\(m = 0\\)) and above or below it, or if it were vertical (undefined slope). A negative\u2011slope line is slanted and therefore must intersect the x\u2011axis exactly once (it could pass through the origin if \\(b = 0\\), in which case the intersection point is \\((0,0)\\))."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How does a negative slope affect the relationship between x and y values as x increases?",
      "student_answer": "A negative slope means that the line falls as you move to the right. In other words, when \\(x\\) gets larger, the corresponding \\(y\\) value gets smaller. For each unit increase in \\(x\\), \\(y\\) decreases by the magnitude of the slope. So the relationship is an inverse (downward\u2011sloping) linear one: larger \\(x\\) \u2192 lower \\(y\\)."
