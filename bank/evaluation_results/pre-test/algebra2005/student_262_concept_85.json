Substituting \\(x = 0\\) gives  \n\n\\[\ny = m(0) + b = b.\n\\]\n\nThus the point \\((0,\\,b)\\) lies on the line and also on the y\u2011axis, making it the intersection of the two. That point is called the y\u2011intercept because it is the \u201cintercept\u201d (or crossing) of the line with the y\u2011axis."

In other words, when the input (the\u202f\\(x\\)-value) is zero, the output (the\u202f\\(y\\)-value) is 4. This point is the \u201cstarting\u201d point of the line on the coordinate plane and appears as the constant term in the line\u2019s equation (e.g., \\(y = mx + 4\\), where \\(m\\) is the slope)."

In other words, the y\u2011axis is the set of all points \\((0, y)\\); therefore when a graph meets that axis, the only possible x\u2011value at that meeting point is zero.
