  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts related to removing negative coefficients and isolating variables. Most answers are correct, showing a clear grasp of the necessary algebraic steps. However, there was a mistake in Question 2 where the student did not correctly eliminate the negative coefficient, leading to an incorrect rewritten equation. Additionally, in Question 9, the final answer was incorrect due to a sign error. Overall, the student is on the right track but should pay attention to signs in their calculations.",

      "student_answer": "When the equation  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{ax}{b}=c\n\\]\n\nis given, the goal is to isolate the variable \\(x\\).  The fraction \\(\\frac{ax}{b}\\) means \u201c\\(ax\\) divided by \\(b\\)\u201d.  To undo this division we need to **multiply both sides by the reciprocal of the fraction**, which is \\(\\frac{b}{ax}\\).  Doing so removes the denominator and leaves \\(x\\) alone.\n\nStep\u2011by\u2011step:\n\n1. **Start with the original equation**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{ax}{b}=c.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Multiply both sides by the reciprocal of the left\u2011hand side\u2019s fraction**  \n   The reciprocal of \\(\\frac{ax}{b}\\) is \\(\\frac{b}{ax}\\).  Multiplying gives  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{b}{ax}\\left(\\frac{ax}{b}\\right)=\\frac{b}{ax}\\,c.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the left side**  \n   The \\(\\frac{b}{ax}\\) and \\(\\frac{ax}{b}\\) cancel each other out, because  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{b}{ax}\\cdot\\frac{ax}{b}=1.\n   \\]\n\n   So the left side reduces to \\(1\\).\n\n4. **Solve for \\(x\\)**  \n   Now we have  \n\n   \\[\n   1 = \\frac{bc}{ax}.\n   \\]\n\n   Multiply both sides by \\(ax\\) (or equivalently, take the reciprocal again) to get  \n\n   \\[\n   ax = bc.\n   \\]\n\n   Finally, divide both sides by \\(a\\) to isolate \\(x\\):  \n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{bc}{a}.\n   \\]\n\n**Why the reciprocal is essential:**  \nTaking the reciprocal (or equivalently, multiplying by the reciprocal) is the algebraic operation that \u201cundoes\u2019\u2019 the original division by \\(b\\) and the multiplication by \\(a\\).  Without applying the reciprocal, the fraction containing \\(x\\) would remain, and we could not isolate \\(x\\) on its own.  The reciprocal effectively flips the fraction, turning the division into multiplication, which is the only way to cancel the denominator and solve for the unknown variable."
