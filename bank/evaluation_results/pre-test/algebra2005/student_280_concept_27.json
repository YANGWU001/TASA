      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between two variables in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "A positive slope means that the two variables move **in the same direction**: as the value on the horizontal axis (usually\u202f\\(x\\)) increases, the value on the vertical axis (usually\u202f\\(y\\)) also increases. In other words, the variables have a **direct (positive) relationship**\u2014when one goes up, the other goes up as well. The steepness of the slope tells you how quickly the dependent variable changes for each unit change in the independent variable."

      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "The slope of a line tells how steep the line is and how much the **y\u2011value changes for each unit increase in x**.  You can read the slope directly from the equation of the line once the equation is written in a form that isolates that relationship.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Slope\u2011intercept form  \n\nThe most straightforward form is  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b\n\\]\n\n* **\\(m\\)** is the slope.  \n* **\\(b\\)** is the y\u2011intercept (the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis).\n\nSo, if the equation is already in this form, the number in front of \\(x\\) is the slope.\n\n**Example:** \\(y = 3x - 5\\) \u2192 slope \\(m = 3\\).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Standard (or general) form  \n\nA line is often written as  \n\n\\[\nAx + By = C\n\\]\n\nTo extract the slope, solve for \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nAx + By &= C \\\\\nBy &= -Ax + C \\\\\ny &= -\\frac{A}{B}x + \\frac{C}{B}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nNow the equation is in slope\u2011intercept form, so the slope is  \n\n\\[\nm = -\\frac{A}{B}\n\\]\n\n**Example:** \\(2x + 4y = 8\\) \u2192 divide by 4: \\(y = -\\frac{2}{4}x + 2\\) \u2192 slope \\(m = -\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Point\u2011slope form  \n\nIf you have a known point \\((x_1 , y_1)\\) on the line, the equation can be written as  \n\n\\[\ny - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\n\\]\n\nHere the coefficient \\(m\\) is explicitly the slope.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Using two points (if the equation isn\u2019t given)\n\nWhen the equation isn\u2019t provided but you have two points \\((x_1 , y_1)\\) and \\((x_2 , y_2)\\) on the line, compute\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{\\,x_2 - x_1\\,}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Quick checklist\n\n| Form of equation | How to read the slope |\n|------------------|----------------------|\n| \\(y = mx + b\\)   | \\(m\\) directly |\n| \\(Ax + By = C\\)  | \\(m = -\\dfrac{A}{B}\\) (solve for \\(y\\)) |\n| \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\) | \\(m\\) is the coefficient of \\((x - x_1)\\) |\n| Two points \\((x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2)\\) | \\(m = \\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\\) |\n\nIn summary, the slope of a line is the number that multiplies the variable \\(x\\) when the line\u2019s equation is expressed in a form that isolates \\(y\\). By rearranging the equation into slope\u2011intercept or point\u2011slope form, you can read the slope directly."

      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Increasing the slope value makes the line **steeper**.  \n\nFor a line with a positive slope\u202f\\(m\\), the slope is the ratio \u201crise over run.\u201d  \n- When \\(m\\) is small (e.g., \\(m = 0.5\\)), the rise is modest compared to the run, so the line climbs gently.  \n- As \\(m\\) gets larger (e.g., \\(m = 2\\) or \\(m = 5\\)), the rise for each unit of run becomes greater, so the line rises more quickly and forms a larger angle with the\u202f\\(x\\)-axis.  \n\nThus, the larger the positive slope, the more pronounced the steepness of the line."

      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "A classic real\u2011world example of a positive slope is the relationship between **distance traveled** and **time elapsed** for a car moving at a constant speed.\n\n- **Variables:**  \n  - *x*\u2011axis\u202f: Time (hours)  \n  - *y*\u2011axis\u202f: Distance from the starting point (miles)\n\n- **Interpretation of the slope:**  \n  The slope of the line \\(y = mx + b\\) in this context is the car\u2019s speed. Because the car is moving forward, the distance increases as time passes, so the slope \\(m\\) is positive. For instance, if the car travels at 60\u202fmph, the equation becomes  \n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance} = 60 \\times \\text{Time} + 0,\n  \\]\n\n  where the slope \\(m = 60\\) (miles per hour) tells us that for every additional hour, the car covers an extra 60 miles.\n\n- **Why the positive slope matters:**  \n  A positive slope confirms that the relationship is **direct**\u2014more time always means more distance. If the slope were zero, the car would be stationary; a negative slope would imply the car is moving backward, which doesn\u2019t fit this scenario.\n\nThus, the positive slope in the distance\u2011versus\u2011time graph directly represents the vehicle\u2019s forward speed, a meaningful and easily observable relationship in everyday life."
