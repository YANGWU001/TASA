  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of coordinate points and their placement, but there are significant errors in identifying coordinates and quadrants. The student correctly describes the process of plotting points and the significance of the origin, indicating some grasp of the concepts. However, confusion persists regarding the x and y coordinates, as seen in Questions 4 and 5. Overall, further review of coordinate systems and plotting points is needed.",

      "student_answer": "To plot\u202f\\((-3,\\;7)\\)\u202fyou just treat the two numbers as\u202f\\(x\\)\u2011 and\u202f\\(y\\)\u2011coordinates:\n\n1. **Find the\u202f\\(x\\)-value** \u2013\u20113.  \n   On the horizontal (x) axis move **left** from the origin 3 units (because it\u2019s negative).\n\n2. **Find the\u202f\\(y\\)-value** \u2013\u20117.  \n   From that spot, move **up** the vertical (y) axis 7 units (positive\u202f\\(y\\) goes upward).\n\n3. **Mark the point** where those two moves meet.  \n   Put a dot (or a small cross) there and, if you like, label it \\((-3,7)\\).\n\nSo the point is three squares to the left of the origin and seven squares up. (I think that\u2019s the usual way to do it.)"

      "student_answer": "To put the point\u202f(0,\u202f0) on a coordinate plane you first draw the two perpendicular axes.  \n- The horizontal line is the **x\u2011axis** and the vertical line is the **y\u2011axis**.  \n- You label the numbers on each axis, usually counting outward from the point where the two axes meet.  \n\nThe point (0,\u202f0) is the **origin** \u2013 it is the spot where the x\u2011axis and the y\u2011axis intersect.  \nBecause both coordinates are zero, you don\u2019t move any units right/left or up/down from the intersection; you just put a dot right at that crossing.  \n\n(If you were using a grid sheet you could also start at the lower\u2011left corner of the paper, move zero squares to the right and zero squares upward, and you would end up at the same spot.)"

It acts as a reference or \u201cstarting\u201d point for locating every other point, so we measure distances and plot values relative to it.  (Often people also think of it as the \u201ccenter\u201d of the grid, which is basically the same idea.)  It\u2019s not really a special point for a particular function, though \u2013 it\u2019s just the common reference for the whole coordinate system."
