      "question": "What does a negative slope indicate in the relationship between two variables?",
      "student_answer": "A negative slope means that the two variables are inversely related: as the value of the independent variable (the one plotted on the\u202fx\u2011axis) goes up, the value of the dependent variable (the one on the\u202fy\u2011axis) goes down. In other words, the relationship is decreasing."

      "question": "If a line has a slope of -2, what does this tell you about the direction of the line?",
      "student_answer": "A slope of\u202f\u20132 means the line falls as you go from left to right.\u202fFor every 1\u2011unit increase in\u202fx, the\u202fy\u2011value drops by 2 units, so the line is decreasing (steeply) in the positive\u2011x direction."

      "question": "Given the equation y = -3x + 5, identify the slope and explain its significance.",
      "student_answer": "**Slope:** \\(-3\\)\n\n**Significance:**  \nThe slope tells us how\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fchanges for each unit increase in\u202f\\(x\\). A slope of\u202f\\(-3\\)\u202fmeans that for every 1\u2011unit increase in\u202f\\(x\\), the value of\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fdecreases by\u202f3 units. In other words, the line falls (goes downward) as we move to the right, indicating a negative rate of change. This rate of change is constant everywhere along the line."

      "question": "How can you determine if a slope is negative by looking at a graph?",
      "student_answer": "To tell whether a line\u2019s slope is negative just by looking at its graph, check how the\u202f*y*\u202fvalues change as you move from left to right (increasing\u202f*x*).\n\n- **Downward\u2011trend:** If the line goes **down** as you go from the left side of the graph to the right side, the *y*\u2011coordinate is decreasing while *x* is increasing. That means the slope is negative.\n- **Point test:** Pick two points on the line, say \\((x_1 , y_1)\\) and \\((x_2 , y_2)\\) with \\(x_2 > x_1\\). If you find that \\(y_2 < y_1\\), the rise (\u0394*y*) is negative while the run (\u0394*x*) is positive, so \\(\\frac{\u0394y}{\u0394x}\\) is negative.\n- **Visual cue:** A line that slants from the upper\u2011left toward the lower\u2011right (or from the upper\u2011right toward the lower\u2011left) has a negative slope. Conversely, a line that rises from left to right has a positive slope.\n\nSo, simply look for a line that falls as you move rightward; that indicates a negative slope."

      "question": "Describe the appearance of a line with a negative slope on a coordinate plane.",
      "student_answer": "A line with a negative slope slopes downward as you move from left to right across the coordinate plane. In other words, as the\u202f\\(x\\)-coordinate\u202fincreases, the\u202f\\(y\\)-coordinate\u202fdecreases. Visually, the line tilts toward the lower\u2011right corner; it may intersect the\u202f\\(y\\)-axis above the\u202f\\(x\\)-axis and the\u202f\\(x\\)-axis to the right of the\u202f\\(y\\)-axis (or vice\u202fversa), but its overall direction is \u201cfalling\u201d from left to right."

      "question": "Can a line with a negative slope ever intersect the x-axis? Explain your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Yes.  \n\nA line with a negative slope is not horizontal, so its \\(y\\)-value changes as \\(x\\) changes.  \nIf the line is written in slope\u2011intercept form  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(m<0\\) (negative) and \\(b\\) is the \\(y\\)-intercept, we can find where it meets the \\(x\\)-axis by setting \\(y=0\\):\n\n\\[\n0 = mx + b \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; x = -\\frac{b}{m}.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(m\\neq 0\\), the denominator is non\u2011zero, and a finite \\(x\\) value exists. Thus the line crosses the \\(x\\)-axis at \\(\\bigl(-\\tfrac{b}{m},\\,0\\bigr)\\).\n\nThe only way a line would *not* intersect the \\(x\\)-axis is if it were horizontal (slope\u202f=\u202f0) and situated entirely above or below the axis, which a negative\u2011slope line never is. Therefore, a line with a negative slope will always intersect the \\(x\\)-axis at exactly one point."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How does a negative slope affect the relationship between x and y values as x increases?",
      "student_answer": "A negative slope means the line falls as you move from left to right. In the equation \\(y = mx + b\\), the \u201c\\(m\\)\u201d (the slope) is a negative number, so each time you increase \\(x\\) by 1 unit, the \\(y\\)\u2011value drops by \\(|m|\\) units. In other words, as \\(x\\) gets larger, \\(y\\) gets smaller \u2013 the relationship is a decreasing linear one. (Conversely, when \\(x\\) gets smaller, \\(y\\) goes up.)"
