      "question": "Is 0.1 considered a small number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think 0.1 isn\u2019t really a \u201csmall\u201d number. It\u2019s a tenth, which is kind of a big part of a whole, so I guess it\u2019s not that tiny. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking."

      "question": "Which of the following is smaller: 0.05 or 0.1?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think 0.1 is the smaller number."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "If you multiply a small number like 0.01 by 10, is the result still considered small? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the result wouldn\u2019t really be considered small. If you take 0.01 and multiply it by 10 you get 0.1, and 0.1 isn\u2019t that tiny\u2014it\u2019s already a decent size compared to the original number. Because it\u2019s ten times bigger, I\u2019d say it\u2019s kind of \u201cmedium\u2011sized\u201d rather than small. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how it seems to me.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How does adding a small number, such as 0.001, to a large number affect the result?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think adding a really tiny number like\u202f0.001\u202fto a big number doesn\u2019t really change it much\u2014basically the result is still about the same as the large number. It\u2019s like the small number gets lost in the huge value."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can negative numbers be considered small numbers? Provide an example to support your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think negative numbers actually aren\u2019t really \u201csmall\u201d numbers.  When we talk about small numbers we usually mean numbers that are close to zero on the positive side, like 0.1 or 2, not the negatives.  For example, \u20133 is a negative number, but I don\u2019t think we would call \u20133 a small number\u2014it's just a negative.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, though\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing things up.)"

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If you divide a small number, such as 0.02, by a large number, will the result be smaller or larger? Explain.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that if you divide a really small number like 0.02 by a big number, the answer actually gets bigger.  \n\nBecause the big number \u201csplits\u201d the tiny amount into more pieces, each piece becomes larger than the original tiny amount. So\u202f0.02 divided by, say, 100 would be something like 0.2\u202f\u2014\u202fwhich is bigger than 0.02.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely sure, but that\u2019s how I understand it."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Write a real-world example where using small numbers is important.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place where using small numbers matters is\u2026 like when you\u2019re counting the number of cars in a parking lot.  You only have a few spots left, so you have to work with a small number of cars to make sure you don\u2019t over\u2011fill the lot.  It\u2019s important to keep track of those few remaining spaces so everything fits."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What happens to a small number like 0.005 if you square it? Does it remain small?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think when you square a tiny number like\u202f0.005 it actually gets a bit bigger. Like, 0.005\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.005 is around\u202f0.025, so it\u2019s not as small anymore. (I\u2019m not really sure, though.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How does the concept of small numbers help in scientific calculations or measurements?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea of \u201csmall numbers\u201d is useful in science because it lets us talk about really tiny amounts or measurements.  When we\u2019re doing calculations we often have to keep track of things that are less than one\u2014like milligrams, microliters, or nanometers\u2014so using small numbers (like 0.001\u202fg or\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u207b\u2076\u202fm) lets us write those values without having to write a lot of zeros.  \n\nI guess it also helps us compare how precise our measurements are: if we can measure something down to a small number, that means our instrument is pretty accurate.  And when we add or multiply numbers, keeping the small\u2011number values straight helps us avoid big errors\u2014like if we forget to include a factor of 10\u207b\u00b3 we could end up with a result that\u2019s a thousand times too large.  \n\nSo, in short, small numbers let scientists express very small quantities, keep track of precision, and make sure calculations stay in the right scale.  (I\u2019m not totally sure about the details, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
