  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of solving for Y in various equations, correctly solving 9 out of 10 problems. The only mistake was in Question 10, where the correct answer should be Y = 15, but the student provided the correct value without showing the solution process. Overall, the student shows good problem-solving skills and understanding of algebraic principles.",
