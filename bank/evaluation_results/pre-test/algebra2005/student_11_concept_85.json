      "student_answer": "The y\u2011intercept is the point where a line meets the y\u2011axis because the y\u2011axis is the set of all points whose x\u2011coordinate is\u202f0.  In other words, every point on the y\u2011axis looks like \\((0, y)\\).  If the equation of the line is written in slope\u2011intercept form  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b ,\n\\]\n\nwe find the point where the line hits the y\u2011axis by setting \\(x = 0\\).  Substituting gives  \n\n\\[\ny = m(0) + b = b .\n\\]\n\nSo the coordinates of the intersection are \\((0, b)\\); the number \\(b\\) is called the y\u2011intercept.  (I think this is also why the graph often looks like it \u201cstarts\u201d at that point, although the slope isn\u2019t zero there\u2014only the x\u2011value is zero.)"

In this case it\u2019s at the point\u202f(0,\u202f4), so when\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0 the value of\u202fy\u202fis\u202f4.  That point is the \u201cstarting\u201d value of the line on the y\u2011axis."

      "question": "Why is the x-coordinate always zero at the y-intercept of a graph?",
      "student_answer": "I think it\u2019s because the y\u2011intercept is the point where the graph **crosses the y\u2011axis**, and the y\u2011axis is defined by the equation \\(x = 0\\).  So any point on that axis\u2014including the point where the graph meets it\u2014must have an \\(x\\)-coordinate of zero.
