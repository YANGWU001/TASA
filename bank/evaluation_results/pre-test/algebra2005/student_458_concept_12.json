      "student_answer": "**Rule (Distributive Property):**  \n\nWhen a single factor multiplies a sum (or difference) inside parentheses, you can \u201celiminate\u201d the parentheses by distributing that factor to each term of the sum.\n\n\\[\n(a + b) \\times c \\;=\\; a \\times c \\;+\\; b \\times c\n\\]\n\nSo the parentheses are removed by multiplying **c** with every term inside the parentheses and rewriting the expression as the sum of those products. This is the standard distributive law for multiplication over addition."
