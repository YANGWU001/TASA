To get \\(x\\) by itself (i.e., to *isolate* it), we need to remove that added 4.  \n\nIf we subtract 4 from the left\u2011hand side, the \\(+4\\) and \\(-4\\) cancel:\n\n\\[\n(x + 4) - 4 = x.\n\\]\n\nBecause we must keep the equality true, we perform the **exact same subtraction** on the right\u2011hand side:\n\n\\[\n9 - 4 = 5.\n\\]\n\nThus the whole operation gives\n\n\\[\nx = 5.\n\\]\n\nSince the same value (4) was removed from both sides, the balance of the equation is preserved, and the only term left on the left is \\(x\\). That is why subtracting the same value from both sides isolates \\(x\\)."
