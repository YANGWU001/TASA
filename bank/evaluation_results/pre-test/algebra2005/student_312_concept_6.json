      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d *divide* both sides by\u202f\\(b\\) to get rid of the fraction.  So you\u2019d do \\(\\dfrac{ax}{b}\\div b = c\\div b\\).  (I\u2019m not completely sure, but that seems like the right step.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think we can solve it by first getting rid of the denominator. So multiply both sides by 5:\n\n\\(5 \\cdot \\frac{3x}{5} = 5 \\cdot 15\\)\n\nThat gives \\(3x = 75\\). Then divide both sides by 3:\n\n\\(x = \\frac{75}{3} = 25\\).\n\nWait, actually... maybe I messed up the division. If we divide 75 by 3, I think it might be 15 instead of 25. So, maybe the solution is \\(x = 15\\). I'm not totally sure."

      "question": "What does the reciprocal rule imply when solving ax/b = c?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the reciprocal rule is kind of about flipping the fraction that\u2019s attached to the variable. So for  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a x}{b}=c,\n\\]\n\nthe thing in front of \\(x\\) is \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\). If we take its reciprocal, which would be \\(\\frac{b}{a}\\), and multiply both sides by that, we \u2026 sort of get rid of the coefficient.  \n\nSo I guess it means you\u2019d end up with  \n\n\\[\nx = c \\cdot \\frac{b}{a},\n\\]\n\nor maybe just \\(x = \\frac{c}{a}\\). I'm not really sure which one is right, but I think the idea is to use the reciprocal \\(\\frac{b}{a}\\) to isolate \\(x\\)."

Then we divide both sides by 6, giving x = 24\u202f/\u202f6 = 4.  \n\nBut\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing something up? If we instead cross\u2011multiply the original fraction, we could do 6x = 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f2, which still gives 6x = 24, and then x = 4.  \n\nActually, I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014perhaps the answer is x = 2?  I\u2019m kind of confused. \n\nSo, um, I\u2019d say x = 2."
