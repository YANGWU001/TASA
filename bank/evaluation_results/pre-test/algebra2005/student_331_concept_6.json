      "student_answer": "Multiplying both sides of  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{ax}{b}=c\n\\]\n\nby the reciprocal of \\(b\\) (i.e., by \\(b\\) itself) is simply the **inverse operation** that removes the division by \\(b\\).  \n\n### Why this works  \n\n1. **Equality must be preserved.**  \n   If two expressions are equal, you may multiply *both* sides by the same non\u2011zero number without changing the truth of the statement.  \n\n2. **The reciprocal undoes the division.**  \n   Division by \\(b\\) is the same as multiplication by \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\).  \n   The reciprocal of \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\) is \\(b\\).  \n   Therefore, multiplying by \\(b\\) cancels the factor \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\) on the left\u2011hand side:\n\n   \\[\n   b\\cdot\\frac{ax}{b}=b\\cdot c.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplification.**  \n   The \\(b\\) in the numerator and denominator on the left side cancel:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{b}{b}\\,ax = ax,\n   \\]\n\n   leaving\n\n   \\[\n   ax = bc.\n   \\]\n\nNow the equation is free of the fraction, and you can continue solving for the remaining variable (e.g., divide by \\(a\\) to get \\(x = \\frac{bc}{a}\\) or divide by \\(x\\) to get \\(a = \\frac{bc}{x}\\), depending on what you need).\n\nIn short, we multiply by the reciprocal of \\(b\\) because it is the legitimate inverse operation that eliminates the denominator while keeping the equality intact."
