      "student_answer": "Having a negative coefficient in front of the\u202f\\(x\\) term simply means that the algebraic sign changes at the step where you isolate\u202f\\(x\\).  \nThe equation  \n\n\\[\n-ax + b = c\\qquad (a>0)\n\\]\n\nis solved in exactly the same logical sequence as any linear equation; the only extra care is to keep track of the minus sign when you move terms or divide.\n\n---\n\n### Step\u2011by\u2011step solution\n\n1. **Move the constant\u202f\\(b\\) to the right\u2011hand side**  \n\n   \\[\n   -ax = c - b\n   \\]\n\n   (Subtract \\(b\\) from both sides.)\n\n2. **Divide by the coefficient of\u202f\\(x\\)**  \n\n   The coefficient is \\(-a\\). To isolate \\(x\\) we divide both sides by \\(-a\\):\n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{c - b}{-a}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the sign**  \n\n   Dividing by a negative is the same as multiplying the numerator by \\(-1\\):\n\n   \\[\n   x = -\\frac{c - b}{a}\n   = \\frac{b - c}{a}\n   \\]\n\n   Either form is correct; the common \u201cclean\u201d version is  \n\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{\\,x = \\dfrac{b - c}{a}\\,}.\n   \\]\n\n---\n\n### What the negative coefficient really does\n\n- **Sign flip**: When you finally divide, the minus sign in \\(-a\\) flips the sign of the whole right\u2011hand side. That is why the numerator becomes \\(b-c\\) instead of \\(c-b\\).\n- **No extra steps**: Apart from this sign change, the algebraic process (subtract/add, then divide) is identical to the case with a positive coefficient.\n- **Alternative route**: Some people first multiply the entire equation by \\(-1\\) to get rid of the leading minus:\n\n  \\[\n  ax - b = -c \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad ax = b - c \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad x = \\frac{b-c}{a},\n  \\]\n\n  which makes the sign handling explicit from the start.\n\n---\n\n### Quick checklist when you see \\(-ax + b = c\\)\n\n1. **Subtract \\(b\\)** \u2192 \\(-ax = c-b\\).  \n2. **Divide by \\(-a\\)** \u2192 \\(x = (c-b)/(-a)\\).  \n3. **Simplify** \u2192 \\(x = (b-c)/a\\).\n\nRemember, the negative coefficient only influences the sign of the final answer; the procedural steps remain the same."
