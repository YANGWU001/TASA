      "question": "Explain what it means for a line to have a positive slope in practical terms, such as in real-world data trends.",
      "student_answer": "A line with a positive slope is one that rises as you move from left to right on a graph. In practical, real\u2011world terms this means that the two quantities you\u2019re comparing move together in the same direction: when the \u201cinput\u201d variable (often plotted on the\u202fx\u2011axis) gets larger, the \u201coutput\u201d variable (plotted on the\u202fy\u2011axis) also gets larger.\n\n**What this looks like in everyday data**\n\n| Example | What the variables are | What a positive slope tells you |\n|---------|------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Temperature vs. Ice\u2011cream sales** |\u202fx = daily average temperature (\u00b0C)\u202f <br>\u202fy = number of ice\u2011cream cones sold | As the temperature goes up, ice\u2011cream sales go up. The line that best fits the data has a positive slope. |\n| **Hours studied vs. test score** |\u202fx = hours spent studying <br>\u202fy = percentage score on a test | More study time tends to produce a higher score, so the trend line slopes upward. |\n| **Advertising budget vs. revenue** |\u202fx = dollars spent on ads <br>\u202fy = revenue generated | Increasing the ad budget leads to higher revenue, reflected by a line with a positive slope. |\n\n**Key practical take\u2011aways**\n\n1. **Direction of change:** A positive slope signals a *direct* (or *positive*) relationship\u2014both variables increase together.\n2. **Steepness matters:** The larger the slope value, the more quickly the output variable rises for each unit increase in the input. A gentle slope means the increase is modest; a steep slope means the increase is rapid.\n3. **Predictive use:** If you know the slope (and the intercept), you can estimate the expected value of the output for a given input. For instance, if a sales trend line has a slope of 5 units of revenue per 1\u202f% increase in market share, a 2\u202f% rise in market share would be expected to add about 10 units of revenue.\n4. **Real\u2011world interpretation:** Positive\u2011slope trends are often what businesses, scientists, or policymakers look for when they want to show that a change they\u2019re making (e.g., boosting advertising, increasing training, raising temperature) is having the desired upward effect on an outcome of interest.\n\nIn short, a positive slope means \u201cmore\u202f\u2192\u202fmore\u201d: as one variable goes up, the other tends to go up as well, and the slope tells you how strong that upward link is."

      "question": "Describe how you can visually identify a positive slope when looking at a graph of a line.",
      "student_answer": "A line has a **positive\u202fslope** when, as you move from the left side of the graph to the right side, the line rises upward. In other words, the\u202f\\(y\\)-values increase as the\u202f\\(x\\)-values increase. Visually you can tell this because the line tilts upward (it looks \u201cup\u2011hill\u201d) \u2013 the left\u2011hand endpoint is lower than the right\u2011hand endpoint. If you draw an imaginary arrow pointing to the right along the line, the arrow points upward. This upward trend signals a positive slope."
