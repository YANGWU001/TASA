  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of how to correctly place points on a coordinate plane. Key concepts such as the correct interpretation of coordinates, the importance of axis labeling, and the method for plotting points are not grasped. The student should focus on understanding the definitions and roles of the x and y coordinates, as well as the significance of the quadrants.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the very first thing you do is plot the\u202fy\u2011coordinate on the vertical axis before you even look at the\u202fx\u2011value. You\u2019d just mark that height on the y\u2011axis and then figure out the rest."

      "question": "If you are given the coordinates (3, -2), where would you place this point on the coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the point\u202f(3,\u202f\u22122) would be placed in the upper\u2011left part of the plane \u2013 so it\u2019s in Quadrant\u202fII."

      "question": "How can you ensure accuracy when plotting a point on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the best way to be accurate when you put a point on a graph is just to eyeball it and then draw a random little dot wherever it looks right. You don\u2019t really need to check the coordinates or line up with the grid lines\u2014just make a quick sketch and call it good.  \n\nIf you really want to be \u201csure,\u201d you could even use a ruler to draw a straight line from the origin to the point you think is correct, even if the line isn\u2019t lined up with the axis markings. That way you\u2019ll have a visual cue that the point is somewhere near where it should be.  \n\nSo basically, just guess the spot, draw the dot, and move on."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate when placing a point.",
      "student_answer": "Um, let me try\u2026  \n\nThe x\u2011coordinate is the \u201cup\u2011and\u2011down\u201d part of a point, so it tells you how far the point is above or below the origin. The y\u2011coordinate is the \u201cleft\u2011and\u2011right\u201d part, so it shows how far the point is to the side of the origin.  \n\nSo when you place a point, you first look at the y\u2011value to see how far it goes left or right, and then you use the x\u2011value to move it up or down.  \n\nI think that\u2019s how they\u2019re different, but I\u2019m not totally sure."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Describe how to place a point at (0, 0) and explain what this point represents.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you put the point at (0,\u202f0) by moving three units to the right and two units down on the grid. Once you get to that spot you just click there and the point appears.  \n\nI\u2019m not sure, but I guess this point represents the \u201ctop\u2011right corner\u201d of the coordinate system, where both the x\u2011 and y\u2011values are at their maximum. It\u2019s kind of like the origin of the graph, but shifted to the upper\u2011right side.  \n\nSo basically you just drag the cursor to that location, click, and you\u2019ve placed the point, which shows where the graph starts in the upper\u2011right quadrant."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How would you place a point with fractional coordinates, such as (2.5, -1.5), on the coordinate plane?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you\u2019d start at the origin and then move **2.5 units to the left** because the x\u2011value is positive, and then go **\u20111.5 units up** since the y\u2011value is negative. So you\u2019d end up somewhere in the upper\u2011left quadrant, around the point (\u20132.5,\u202f1.5). I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s how I\u2019d try to place it."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What is the importance of consistently labeling axes when placing points?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s not really that important to label the axes every time. Like, you can just put the points wherever and people will figure it out anyway. I guess the labels are just extra work and don\u2019t really affect how you read the graph."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If a point is incorrectly placed, what steps can you take to verify and correct its position?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think if a point ends up in the wrong spot you can just eyeball it and move it a little bit until it looks right. Maybe you could compare it to a random point nearby and then nudge it in that direction. Another thing you might do is measure the distance from the origin and if it\u2019s not exactly the number you expected, just add or subtract a few units until it seems close enough. I guess you could also ask someone else to guess where the point should be and then copy that. Honestly, I think the best way is just to guess and adjust until it feels correct."
