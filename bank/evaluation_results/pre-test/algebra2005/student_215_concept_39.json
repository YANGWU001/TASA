      "student_answer": "To decide which side to move each term to, first decide which side you want the variable\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fto end up on.  \nThe usual goal is to **isolate\u202f\\(x\\)**, so we gather **all the \\(x\\)-terms on one side** and **all the constant terms on the other side**.  \n\n1. **Identify the \\(x\\)-terms**  \n   - On the left you have \\(x\\).  \n   - On the right you have \\(c x\\).\n\n2. **Move one of the \\(x\\)-terms to the opposite side**  \n   - Subtract \\(c x\\) from both sides (or add \\(-c x\\) to the left).  \n   - This puts the \\(x\\)-terms together:  \n     \\[\n     x - c x = d - b\n     \\]\n\n3. **Move the constant terms to the other side**  \n   - Subtract \\(b\\) from both sides (or add \\(-b\\) to the right).  \n   - This leaves the constants on the right:  \n     \\[\n     (1 - c)x = d - b\n     \\]\n\nSo the rule is: **move the \\(x\\)-terms to one side (usually the left) and the constant terms to the opposite side (usually the right).** The choice of \u201cleft\u201d or \u201cright\u201d is just a matter of convenience; the important thing is that all \\(x\\)-terms end up together and all constants end up together."

      "student_answer": "When we \u201cconsolidate\u201d (or collect) the variable terms on one side of an equation such as  \n\n\\[\nax + b = cx + d ,\n\\]\n\nthe **sign** that each term carries tells us whether the term is added to or subtracted from that side.  \n\n* **Positive sign (+)** \u2013 The term stays on the side where it already is.  \n* **Negative sign (\u2013)** \u2013 The term is being subtracted from that side, or equivalently, it is being **added** to the opposite side after we move it.\n\nThe usual procedure is:\n\n1. **Choose a side** (often the left) on which you want all the \\(x\\)-terms.  \n2. **Move the \\(x\\)-term(s) on the other side** to the chosen side.  \n   - If you move a term across the equality sign, you **change its sign**.  \n   - For example, moving \\(cx\\) from the right to the left turns \\(+cx\\) into \\(-cx\\):  \n\n     \\[\n     ax - cx + b = d .\n     \\]\n\n3. **Move the constant terms** to the opposite side, again changing their signs.  \n   - Moving \\(b\\) to the right turns \\(+b\\) into \\(-b\\):  \n\n     \\[\n     ax - cx = d - b .\n     \\]\n\n4. **Combine like terms** using the signs you now have:  \n\n   \\[\n   (a - c)x = d - b .\n   \\]\n\nSo the significance of the signs is that they indicate **whether a term is being added to or subtracted from the side it is on**, and they dictate how the term\u2019s sign changes when the term is transferred across the equal sign. Getting the signs right is essential; an incorrect sign will give the wrong coefficient for \\(x\\) or the wrong constant on the other side, leading to an incorrect solution."

      "student_answer": "When you \u201cconsolidate variables\u201d you are simply moving all the\u202fx\u2011terms to one side of the equation and all the constant terms to the other side.  \nThe way the arithmetic works out depends on what coefficient is attached to the\u202fx\u202fon the right\u2011hand side.\n\n---\n\n### 1.\u202f\\(ax + b = x + d\\)\n\n*The right\u2011hand side has an implicit coefficient of\u202f1 in front of\u202f\\(x\\).*\n\n1. Move the \\(x\\) on the right to the left:  \n\n\\[\nax - x + b = d\n\\]\n\n2. Combine the like\u2011terms \\(ax - x = (a-1)x\\):  \n\n\\[\n(a-1)x + b = d\n\\]\n\n3. Move the constant \\(b\\) to the right:  \n\n\\[\n(a-1)x = d - b\n\\]\n\nSo the \u201cconsolidated\u201d form is \\((a-1)x = d - b\\).  The key point is that the coefficient that disappears from the right side is **1**, so you subtract **1** from the coefficient\u202f\\(a\\).\n\n---\n\n### 2.\u202f\\(ax + b = cx\\)\n\n*Now the right\u2011hand side has a coefficient \\(c\\) in front of\u202f\\(x\\).*\n\n1. Move the \\(cx\\) term to the left:  \n\n\\[\nax - cx + b = 0\n\\]\n\n2. Combine the like\u2011terms \\(ax - cx = (a-c)x\\):  \n\n\\[\n(a-c)x + b = 0\n\\]\n\n3. Move the constant \\(b\\) to the right (or just subtract it from both sides):  \n\n\\[\n(a-c)x = -b\n\\]\n\nThus the consolidated form is \\((a-c)x = -b\\).  Here the coefficient that is removed from the right side is **\\(c\\)**, so you subtract **\\(c\\)** from the left\u2011hand coefficient\u202f\\(a\\).\n\n---\n\n### What\u2019s the difference?\n\n| Equation | Right\u2011hand coefficient of\u202f\\(x\\) | Result after consolidation |\n|----------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| \\(ax + b = x + d\\) | \\(1\\) | \\((a-1)x = d - b\\) |\n| \\(ax + b = cx\\)    | \\(c\\) | \\((a-c)x = -b\\)   |\n\n- **Coefficient subtraction**: In the first case you subtract\u202f1 from\u202f\\(a\\); in the second you subtract\u202f\\(c\\) from\u202f\\(a\\).  \n- **Constant term on the right**: The first equation leaves a non\u2011zero constant \\(d\\) on the right, so after consolidation you have \\(d - b\\). The second equation has no constant on the right initially, so moving \\(b\\) gives \\(-b\\).\n\nIn short, the presence of a different coefficient on the right\u2011hand side changes both the new coefficient of\u202f\\(x\\) and the constant term that appears after you finish consolidating."
