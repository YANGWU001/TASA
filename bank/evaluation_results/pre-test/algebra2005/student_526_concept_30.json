      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain what it means for a line to have a positive slope in practical terms, such as in real-world data trends.",
      "student_answer": "A positive\u2011slope line is one that **rises** as you move from left to right on a graph.  In everyday terms this means that when the variable you\u2019re plotting on the horizontal axis (\u202fx\u202f) gets larger, the variable on the vertical axis (\u202fy\u202f) also gets larger.  The amount it rises per unit of\u202fx\u202fis the slope, so a \u201csteeper\u201d positive slope means a bigger increase in\u202fy\u202f for each step in\u202fx.\n\n**Practical interpretation**\n\n* **Price vs. quantity sold** \u2013 If a product\u2019s price (\u202fx\u202f) goes up and the quantity demanded (\u202fy\u202f) also goes up, the data would have a positive slope, suggesting that a higher price is associated with higher sales (perhaps because the product is viewed as higher\u2011quality).\n\n* **Study time vs. test score** \u2013 As the number of hours studied (\u202fx\u202f) increases, the test score (\u202fy\u202f) tends to increase, giving a positive\u2011slope trend.  The slope tells you roughly how many extra points you earn per additional hour of study.\n\n* **Temperature over the day** \u2013 From early morning to noon the temperature (\u202fy\u202f) usually rises as the time of day (\u202fx\u202f) increases, so the temperature\u2011versus\u2011time line has a positive slope.\n\nIn these examples the line is \u201ctilting upward to the right,\u201d which is what most textbooks call a positive slope.  (Sometimes people mistakenly say it tilts upward to the left, but that would actually be a negative slope.)  \n\nBecause the slope is constant for a straight line, the rate of change stays the same throughout the range of data.  In real\u2011world data the relationship might only be approximately linear, but a positive\u2011slope fit still conveys the idea that the two variables move together in the same direction.  \n\nSo, in short: a positive slope means **both variables tend to increase together**, and the numerical value of the slope tells you how quickly the vertical variable grows for each unit increase in the horizontal variable."

      "question": "Describe how you can visually identify a positive slope when looking at a graph of a line.",
      "student_answer": "When you look at the graph, a line with a **positive slope** is the one that **rises as you go from left to right**. In other words, as you move to larger\u202f\\(x\\)\u2011values the \\(y\\)-values get bigger, so the line tilts upward and makes an acute angle with the positive\u202f\\(x\\)-axis.  \n\nVisually you can see this as a line that \u201cgoes up\u201d rather than \u201cgoes down.\u201d (Sometimes people also note that such a line often crosses the\u202f\\(y\\)-axis above the origin, but that isn\u2019t required \u2013 a line can have a positive slope even if it meets the\u202f\\(y\\)-axis below zero, as long as it still rises toward the right.)"
