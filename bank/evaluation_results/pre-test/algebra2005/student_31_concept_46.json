      "question": "What does a negative slope indicate in the relationship between two variables?",
      "student_answer": "A negative slope means that the two variables move in opposite directions: as one variable\u202fincreases, the other tends to decrease. In other words, the relationship is a decreasing (inverse) one."

      "question": "If a line has a slope of -2, what does this tell you about the direction of the line?",
      "student_answer": "A slope of\u202f\u20112 means the line falls (decreases) as you move from left to right.  \nSpecifically, for every\u202f1 unit you go horizontally to the right, the line drops\u202f2 units vertically. In other words, the line is downward\u2011sloping (negative direction)."

      "student_answer": "**Slope:**\u2003The slope of the line \\(y = -3x + 5\\) is \\(-3\\).\n\n**What it means:**  \n- The slope tells us how steep the line is and the direction it moves as \\(x\\) changes.  \n- A slope of \\(-3\\) means that for every increase of 1 unit in \\(x\\), the value of \\(y\\) **decreases** by 3 units.  \n- Because the slope is negative, the line falls (leans downward) from left to right.  \n- The magnitude \\(|-3| = 3\\) indicates the steepness: the line is relatively steep compared to a slope of, say, \\(-1\\).  \n\nIn short, \\(-3\\) is the rate of change of \\(y\\) with respect to \\(x\\); it tells us how quickly and in which direction the output (\u202f\\(y\\)\u202f) changes as the input (\u202f\\(x\\)\u202f) changes."

      "question": "How can you determine if a slope is negative by looking at a graph?",
      "student_answer": "To tell whether a line\u2019s slope is negative just by looking at its graph, check how the line behaves as you move from left\u2011to\u2011right (increasing\u202fx):\n\n1. **Watch the direction of the line.**  \n   - If the line goes **downward** as you go to the right (higher\u2011x values have lower\u2011y values), the slope is negative.  \n   - If it goes upward as you move right, the slope is positive.\n\n2. **Pick two points on the line** (it\u2019s often easiest to choose points that are easy to read, like where the line crosses grid lines).  \n   - Compute the \u201crise over run\u201d: \\((y_2 - y_1)/(x_2 - x_1)\\).  \n   - If this quotient is less than\u202f0, the slope is negative.\n\n3. **Visual cue on the axes.**  \n   - On the x\u2011axis, locate a point on the left side of the graph and a point on the right side.  \n   - If the point on the right is lower on the y\u2011axis than the point on the left, the line is sloping downwards, indicating a negative slope.\n\nIn short, a line that **descends** as you move from left to right (or where \u201crise\u201d is opposite in sign to \u201crun\u201d) has a negative slope."

      "student_answer": "A line with a negative slope falls as you move from left to right.\u202fOn the coordinate plane it runs from the upper\u2011left side toward the lower\u2011right side, so as the\u202fx\u2011value increases the\u202fy\u2011value decreases.

      "question": "Can a line with a negative slope ever intersect the x-axis? Explain your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Yes. A line that has a negative slope is not parallel to the x\u2011axis, so it must cross the x\u2011axis at some point.\n\nIf the line is written in slope\u2011intercept form  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nthe slope \\(m\\) is negative (\\(m<0\\)). To find where it meets the x\u2011axis we set \\(y=0\\):\n\n\\[\n0 = mx + b \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad x = -\\frac{b}{m}.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(m\\neq 0\\), the fraction \\(-\\dfrac{b}{m}\\) is a real number, giving a specific x\u2011coordinate where the line touches the x\u2011axis. (The only way a line would never intersect the x\u2011axis is if it were horizontal, i.e., \\(m=0\\).)\n\nThus any non\u2011horizontal line with a negative slope will intersect the x\u2011axis exactly once."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How does a negative slope affect the relationship between x and y values as x increases?",
      "student_answer": "A negative slope means the line falls as you move to the right.\u202fIn other words, when\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fgets larger, the corresponding\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fvalue gets smaller. The rate of that decrease is given by the magnitude of the slope (e.g., a slope of\u202f\\(-3\\)\u202fmeans\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fdrops\u202f3 units for every 1\u2011unit increase in\u202f\\(x\\)). This inverse (downward\u2011sloping) relationship is why a negative slope indicates that\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fmove in opposite directions."
