  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of large numbers, correctly identifying values, performing calculations, and explaining concepts. However, there was a mistake in the rounding question, where the student incorrectly rounded 8,763,492 to 9,000,000 instead of 9,000,000. Overall, the student shows good comprehension and application of the topic.",

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain how place value helps in understanding large numbers.",
      "student_answer": "Place value is the idea that the value of a digit depends on where it sits in a number.\u202fWhen you move one place to the left, the digit is usually worth ten times as much as it was in the place to its right.\u202fBecause of this, we can break a huge number into manageable parts \u2013 ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten\u2011thousands, hundred\u2011thousands, millions, and so on.  \n\nFor example, the number 4\u202f532 means:  \n\n* 4\u202fthousands (\u202f4\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f000\u202f)  \n* 5\u202fhundreds (\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202f)  \n* 3\u202ftens (\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f)  \n* 2\u202fones (\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f)  \n\nSeeing the number this way helps us understand how big it is and how each digit contributes to the total.  \n\nI think the digit in the hundred\u2011thousands place is worth a hundred times the digit in the thousands place, which lets us compare the size of those parts quickly.  (So you can see that moving two places left makes the value a hundred\u2011fold increase.)  \n\nOverall, using place value lets us read, write, and compare large numbers more easily because we can treat each \u201cblock\u201d of digits as a separate unit (thousands, millions, etc.) and then add them together."
