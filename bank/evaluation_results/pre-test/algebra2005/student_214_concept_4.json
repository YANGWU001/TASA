      "student_answer": "Isolating \\(x\\) after you have removed the negative coefficient is the final step that actually gives you the solution of the equation.  \n\n1. **Eliminates the sign error** \u2013 The original equation \\(-\\dfrac{a x}{b}=c\\) has a negative sign attached to the term containing \\(x\\). When you \u201cremove\u201d that negative sign (for example, by multiplying both sides by \\(-1\\)), you rewrite the equation as \\(\\dfrac{a x}{b} = -c\\). At this point the \\(x\\)-term is correctly signed, but it is still embedded in a fraction.\n\n2. **Clears the fraction** \u2013 Multiplying both sides by \\(b\\) gives \\(a x = -c b\\). This step gets rid of the denominator, leaving a simple linear term in \\(x\\).\n\n3. **Solves for the unknown** \u2013 The last operation, dividing both sides by \\(a\\), isolates \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-c b}{a}.\n   \\]\n   Only after this isolation do you actually know the value of \\(x\\) that satisfies the original equation.\n\n4. **Ensures equivalence** \u2013 Each algebraic manipulation (multiplying by \\(-1\\), multiplying by \\(b\\), dividing by \\(a\\)) is reversible and preserves the equality. By systematically isolating \\(x\\), you guarantee that the solution you obtain is equivalent to the original problem, without introducing extraneous solutions or losing the correct sign.\n\n5. **Facilitates interpretation** \u2013 Once \\(x\\) is isolated, the result can be interpreted directly in the context of the problem (e.g., a physical quantity, a rate, etc.). If the variable remains tangled with other terms, it is difficult to see how changes in the given parameters affect the unknown.\n\nIn short, isolating \\(x\\) after handling the negative coefficient converts the transformed equation into the explicit solution \\(x = \\dfrac{-c b}{a}\\). This is why isolation is the crucial final step in solving the equation correctly."
