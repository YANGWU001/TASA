      "question": "Explain why taking the reciprocal of both sides of the equation ax/b = c is necessary when solving for x.",
      "student_answer": "When the variable you are trying to isolate appears in the denominator, the quickest way to \u201cfree\u201d it from that denominator is to invert (take the reciprocal of) the whole equation.  \n\nStarting with  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{ax}{b}=c,\n\\]\n\nthe unknown\u202f\\(x\\) is inside the product \\(ax\\) that is itself being divided by \\(b\\). If we simply multiplied both sides by \\(b\\) we would obtain  \n\n\\[\nax = bc,\n\\]\n\nwhich is already a good step toward solving for \\(x\\); the next step would be to divide by \\(a\\).  \n\nHowever, many students prefer to first eliminate the fraction altogether by taking the reciprocal of **both sides**:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{ax}= \\frac{1}{c}.\n\\]\n\nWhy does this help?  \n\n1. **Moves the unknown from the denominator to the numerator.**  \n   In the original equation the unknown is hidden inside a denominator (the whole expression \\(\\frac{ax}{b}\\)). After reciprocating, the unknown appears in the denominator of a *single* fraction \\(\\frac{b}{ax}\\), making it easier to isolate with multiplication.\n\n2. **Allows a direct multiplication step.**  \n   Once the reciprocal is taken, you can multiply both sides by \\(ax\\) (the denominator that contains the unknown) without having to worry about \u201cundoing\u201d a division that also involves the unknown:\n\n   \\[\n   b = \\frac{ax}{c}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Reduces the number of algebraic operations.**  \n   After the reciprocal step, a single multiplication by \\(c\\) followed by a division by \\(a\\) yields the solution:\n\n   \\[\n   bc = ax \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad x = \\frac{bc}{a}.\n   \\]\n\nIn short, taking the reciprocal transforms the original fraction into a form where the unknown \\(x\\) can be isolated by simple multiplication and division. It\u2019s not the *only* way to solve the equation (multiplying by \\(b\\) first works just as well), but it provides a clean pathway that removes the denominator in one step, making the subsequent algebra straightforward."

      "student_answer": "Isolating\u202f\\(x\\) after you\u2019ve gotten rid of the negative coefficient is the final step that actually gives you the solution to the problem.  \n\nWhen the equation starts as  \n\n\\[\n-\\frac{a x}{b}=c,\n\\]\n\nthe first thing you do is remove the minus sign (for example, by multiplying both sides by \\(-1\\)) so you have  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a x}{b}= -c .\n\\]\n\nAt this point the variable \\(x\\) is still \u201cburied\u201d inside a fraction.

This is important because:\n\n1. **It yields the actual value of the variable.**  Without isolating \\(x\\) you can\u2019t tell what number satisfies the original equation.  \n2. **It avoids sign\u2011errors.**  Keeping the negative sign attached to the fraction can be confusing; moving it to the numerator (or using a reciprocal) makes the final answer clearer.  \n3. **It lets you check the work.**  Once you have \\(x\\) isolated you can plug it back into the original equation to verify that both sides are equal.  \n4. **It prepares the solution for further use.**  In more complex problems you often need the explicit form of \\(x\\) to substitute into other equations or to interpret the result in the context of the problem.\n\nSo, after you eliminate the negative coefficient, isolating \\(x\\) is the step that transforms the equation from a relationship into a concrete solution."
