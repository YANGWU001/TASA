      "question": "What is the square root of 784, and explain why finding square roots of larger numbers can be challenging?",
      "student_answer": "The square root of 784 is **28** (I think it works out to 28 because 28\u202f\u00d7\u202f28\u202f=\u202f784).\n\nFinding square roots of larger numbers can be tricky for a few reasons:\n\n- **Harder to spot the exact factor pair** \u2013 With small numbers you can often guess the root by remembering a few squares (like 4\u00b2\u202f=\u202f16, 5\u00b2\u202f=\u202f25, etc.). For big numbers there are far more possibilities, so it\u2019s not easy to see which whole number multiplies by itself to give the original number.  \n- **You usually need a systematic method** \u2013 Techniques such as prime\u2011factor decomposition, the long\u2011division style \u201csquare\u2011root algorithm,\u201d or using a calculator are more involved than just squaring a single\u2011digit number.  \n- **Estimation becomes less accurate** \u2013 When you estimate a root (e.g., using nearby perfect squares), the gap between those squares gets larger as the numbers grow, so the estimate can be off by a lot unless you refine it.  \n- **Rounding errors** \u2013 If you\u2019re doing it by hand or with approximations, small mistakes in the intermediate steps can lead to a noticeably wrong final answer for large numbers.\n\nAll of these factors mean that, unlike the simple case of 784, larger numbers often require more careful work or a tool to find their exact square roots."

      "question": "Explain why calculating percentages like 37% of 8592 can be difficult without a calculator, and then solve it.",
      "student_answer": "**Why it\u2019s hard without a calculator**\n\nWhen you have to find a percent of a large, four\u2011digit number you have to do two steps in your head:\n\n1. **Turn the percent into a decimal or a fraction.**  \n  \u202f\u202f37\u202f% = 0.37 = 37\u2044100.  \n2. **Multiply the big number by that decimal (or by 37 and then divide by 100).**  \n\nMultiplying 8\u202f592 by 0.37 means you\u2019re really doing 8\u202f592\u202f\u00d7\u202f37 and then moving the decimal two places.  \nBoth of those pieces \u2013 a three\u2011digit multiplication and a division by 100 \u2013 are easy with paper, but they\u2019re easy to slip up on mentally, especially if you try to keep track of all the zeroes at once. Small arithmetic slips (like mixing up a 7 for a 9, or forgetting a carry) can change the final answer by a few hundred, so most people prefer a calculator for accuracy.\n\n---\n\n**Doing the calculation**\n\nI\u2019ll break the multiplication into two easier parts:\n\n\\[\n8{,}592 \\times 0.37 = 8{,}592 \\times \\left(0.3 + 0.07\\right)\n\\]\n\n* **30\u202f% (0.3) of 8\u202f592**  \n  \\[\n  8{,}592 \\times 0.3 = 2{,}577.6\n  \\]\n\n* **7\u202f% (0.07) of 8\u202f592**  \n  \\[\n  8{,}592 \\times 0.07 = 601.44\n  \\]\n\nAdd the two results:\n\n\\[\n2{,}577.6 \\;+\\; 601.44 \\;\\approx\\; 3{,}179.04\n\\]\n\nSo, **37\u202f% of 8\u202f592 is about\u202f3\u202f179.04** (roughly\u202f3\u202f179 when you round to the nearest whole number).\n\n*I think this is the right answer, but if I made a tiny slip\u2011up in the addition it could be a little off \u2013 the important point is that the process shows why the calculation is tricky without a calculator.*"

This comes from recognizing that each factor is just 1\u20132 less than 10\u202f000 and adjusting the product of 10\u202f000\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f000 accordingly."
