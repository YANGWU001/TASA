      "student_answer": "I think\u202f0.1 is a small number. It\u2019s less than\u202f1 and very close to zero, so compared to whole numbers like\u202f1,\u202f10, or\u202f100 it\u2019s considered \u201csmall.\u201d"

      "question": "If you multiply a small number like 0.01 by 10, is the result still considered small? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Multiplying\u202f0.01\u202fby\u202f10 gives  \n\n\\[\n0.01 \\times 10 = 0.1 .\n\\]\n\nEven though the value gets ten times larger,\u202f0.1\u202fis still less than\u202f1, so it is generally regarded as a \u201csmall\u201d number (especially compared with whole numbers or larger decimals).  \n\nIn other words, the operation moves the decimal point one place to the right, but it doesn\u2019t make the number big enough to be considered large. So the result is still a small number."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How does adding a small number, such as 0.001, to a large number affect the result?",
      "student_answer": "Adding a tiny value like\u202f0.001 to a much larger number pretty much doesn\u2019t change the result. In other words, the sum is essentially the same as the large number \u2013 the 0.001 is too small to make any noticeable difference. (I think this is what usually happens when the small number is added to a very big one.)"

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can negative numbers be considered small numbers? Provide an example to support your answer.",
      "student_answer": "I think negative numbers can be counted as \u201csmall\u201d numbers because they are less than zero and are close to the origin on the number line. For example,\u202f\u20113 is a negative number, and it\u2019s smaller than 0, so it can be described as a small number (in the sense of being near the lower end of the number line)."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If you divide a small number, such as 0.02, by a large number, will the result be smaller or larger? Explain.",
      "student_answer": "I think the result will actually be larger. When you divide a small number like\u202f0.02\u202fby a big number, the division \u201cspreads\u201d the small amount over a larger divisor, which tends to increase the value of the quotient. (So the answer is larger.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Write a real-world example where using small numbers is important.",
      "student_answer": "One place where using really small numbers matters is **when a doctor prescribes medication**.  \nFor many drugs the correct dose is measured in milligrams (mg) or even micrograms (\u00b5g).  If the nurse reads \u201c5\u202fmg\u201d as \u201c5\u202fg\u201d the patient could get a dose that is a thousand\u2011times too high, which can be dangerous or even deadly.  So the medical team has to be precise with those tiny numbers and double\u2011check the units.\n\nAnother situation that **might** need small numbers is when you\u2019re planning a road trip and you look at the distance between two towns on a map.  I think you would use the small numbers on the scale (like 0.1\u202fcm\u202f=\u202f1\u202fkm) to figure out how far you\u2019ll drive.  But actually, those distances are usually measured in whole kilometers or miles, so the small\u2011number details on the map aren\u2019t that important for the real trip.  \n\nSo, medication dosing is a clear real\u2011world example where tiny numbers are critical, while using the tiny measurements on a map is probably not as essential."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What happens to a small number like 0.005 if you square it? Does it remain small?",
      "student_answer": "When you square a tiny number, the result gets **even tinier** because you\u2019re multiplying the small value by itself.\n\nFor example:  \n\n\\[\n0.005^2 \\;=\\; 0.005 \\times 0.005 \\;=\\; 0.000025.\n\\]\n\nSo the squared value (0.000025) is still a small number\u2014indeed, it\u2019s smaller than the original 0.005. In general, squaring a number whose absolute value is less than\u202f1 will produce a result that is closer to zero, i.e., \u201cmore small.\u201d"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How does the concept of small numbers help in scientific calculations or measurements?",
      "student_answer": "The idea of **\u201csmall numbers\u201d** \u2013 that is, values that are much less than 1 (like 0.001, 10\u207b\u2076, etc.) \u2013 is useful in a few different ways when scientists do calculations or take measurements.\n\n* **Scientific notation and scaling** \u2013 By writing tiny quantities in scientific notation (e.g., 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u207b\u2074\u202fm) we can keep the numbers easy to read and avoid long strings of zeros. This makes algebraic manipulations simpler and reduces the chance of making copy\u2011and\u2011paste errors.  \n\n* **Precision and significant figures** \u2013 When a measurement is a small number, it usually means the instrument is capable of detecting fine differences. That extra precision can be important when we are trying to see subtle effects, such as the change in concentration of a trace gas.  \n\n* **Error propagation** \u2013 Small\u2011value terms often contribute very little to the total uncertainty, so in some approximations we can neglect them to make the math easier. For example, when adding 1.0\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3 and 2.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u207b\u00b2, the tiny term hardly changes the result, so we might drop it in a quick estimate.  \n\n* **Dimensionless ratios** \u2013 Many physical models use ratios that are much smaller than 1 (like the Reynolds number in very slow flows, or the Mach number for subsonic speeds). Recognizing that these numbers are small tells us that certain terms in the governing equations can be ignored, simplifying the calculation.  \n\n* **Limitations** \u2013 On the other hand, sometimes a small number can hide a big effect if it is multiplied by a huge factor later on (e.g., a tiny probability multiplied by a very large population). So we have to be careful not to discard small numbers automatically.  \n\nOverall, thinking about how **small** a quantity is helps scientists decide which parts of an equation are essential, choose the right level of precision, and communicate results clearly. I think the main benefit is the ability to simplify calculations while still keeping the important physical information."
