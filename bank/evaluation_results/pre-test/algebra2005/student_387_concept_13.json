  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of simplifying fractions, correctly applying the concept in most answers. However, there was a mistake in Question 2 where the simplified form of 45/60 was incorrectly stated. Additionally, in Question 8, the GCD was correctly identified, but the simplified fraction was incorrect. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the topic.",

The recipe calls for **30 cups of flour** out of a total of **45 cups of dry ingredients** (the rest are sugar, cocoa powder, etc.). She wants to know what fraction of the dry mix is made up of flour so she can adjust the recipe if she needs to make a smaller batch.\n\n**Solving the problem**\n\nThe fraction that represents flour in the dry mix is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{30}{45}.\n\\]\n\nTo simplify, divide the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 15:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{30 \\div 15}{45 \\div 15}= \\frac{2}{3}.\n\\]\n\n**Answer**\n\nFlour makes up **\\( \\displaystyle \\frac{2}{3} \\)** of the dry ingredients in Emma\u2019s cookie mix. This means that for every 3 parts of dry mix, 2 parts are flour. If she decides to make a smaller batch using only half the dry mix (i.e., \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) of the original 45\u202fcups\u202f=\u202f22.5\u202fcups), she would need  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times 22.5 \\text{ cups} = 15 \\text{ cups of flour}.\n\\]"
