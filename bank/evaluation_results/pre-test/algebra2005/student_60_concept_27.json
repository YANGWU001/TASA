      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between two variables in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "A positive slope means that the two variables change in the same direction: as the value on the horizontal axis (the independent variable) increases, the value on the vertical axis (the dependent variable) also increases. In other words, the variables have a direct\u2014or positive\u2014relationship."

      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "The slope of a line tells how steep the line is \u2013 it is the \u201crise over run,\u201d or the change in \\(y\\) for each unit change in \\(x\\).  \nFrom an equation you can read the slope directly once the equation is put into a form where the coefficient of \\(x\\) is easy to see.\n\n### 1. Slope\u2011intercept form  \nIf the line is written as  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nthe number \\(m\\) **is** the slope. The constant \\(b\\) is the \\(y\\)-intercept, but it does not affect the slope.\n\n### 2. Standard (general) form  \nA line may also be given as  \n\n\\[\nAx + By = C,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) are constants and \\(B\\neq 0\\). Solve for \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\nBy = -Ax + C \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad y = \\left(-\\frac{A}{B}\\right)x + \\frac{C}{B}.\n\\]\n\nNow the equation is in slope\u2011intercept form, so the slope is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,m = -\\frac{A}{B}\\,}.\n\\]\n\n(If \\(B = 0\\) the line is vertical, \\(x = \\text{constant}\\); its slope is undefined.)\n\n### 3. Point\u2011slope form  \nWhen the equation is given as  \n\n\\[\ny - y_1 = m(x - x_1),\n\\]\n\nthe coefficient \\(m\\) again is the slope, and \\((x_1,y_1)\\) is a point on the line.\n\n### 4. Other cases  \nIf the equation is not already solved for \\(y\\) (for example, \\(2x + 3y = 7\\) or a more complicated expression), isolate \\(y\\) on one side to obtain the \\(mx\\) term, then read off the coefficient of \\(x\\).  \n\nAlternatively, if you have two points \\((x_1,y_1)\\) and \\((x_2,y_2)\\) that satisfy the equation, you can compute the slope directly with  \n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{y_2-y_1}{\\,x_2-x_1\\,}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**In short:** Put the equation into a form where \\(y\\) is isolated (slope\u2011intercept or point\u2011slope). The number multiplying \\(x\\) is the slope; for standard form \\(Ax+By=C\\) the slope is \\(-A/B\\)."

      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Increasing the slope value makes a line with a positive slope **steeper**.  \n\nThe slope \\(m\\) tells us how much the line rises for each unit it runs to the right (rise\u202f\u00f7\u202frun).  \n- When \\(m\\) is small (e.g., \\(m = 0.5\\)), the rise is modest compared to the run, so the line looks relatively flat.  \n- When \\(m\\) is larger (e.g., \\(m = 2\\)), the rise is twice as great for the same horizontal distance, so the line tilts upward more sharply.  \n\nThus, as the positive slope increases, the angle the line makes with the horizontal axis grows, and the line appears more \u201csteep.\u201d"

      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "A classic real\u2011world example of a positive slope is the relationship between hours studied and a test score.\n\n- **Variables:**  \n  - *X* = number of hours a student spends studying for an exam.  \n  - *Y* = the score the student earns on that exam (out of 100).\n\n- **Positive slope meaning:** As *X* increases, *Y* also increases. In other words, each additional hour of study tends to raise the test score by a consistent amount.\n\n- **Why it\u2019s meaningful:**  \n  - The slope tells us how much the score improves for each extra hour of study. If the slope is 5, then every extra hour of studying is associated with an average increase of 5 points on the test.  \n  - This information helps students and teachers plan study schedules, allocate tutoring time, and set realistic expectations for performance improvement.\n\nThus, the line \\(Y = mX + b\\) with a positive \\(m\\) (slope) captures the intuitive idea that \u201cmore study leads to higher scores.\u201d"

      "student_answer": "**Slope:**\u202f2  \n\n**Why it\u2019s positive:**  \nIn the equation \\(y = 2x + 3\\) the number in front of \\(x\\) is the slope (the \u201c\\(m\\)\u201d in the slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\)).

A positive slope means that as \\(x\\) increases, the value of \\(y\\) also increases\u2014each unit you move to the right along the \\(x\\)-axis raises the line by \\(2\\) units on the \\(y\\)-axis.
