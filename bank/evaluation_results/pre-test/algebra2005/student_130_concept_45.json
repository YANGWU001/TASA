      "student_answer": "The slope of the line is the coefficient of\u202fx, which in this equation is **\u20133**.  \n\nI think it\u2019s negative because the number in front of\u202fx is a minus sign. That means that for each increase of\u202f1 in\u202fx, the value of\u202fy decreases by\u202f3 units \u2013 the line falls as you move to the right, which is exactly what a negative slope tells you."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you determine if a slope is negative by looking at a graph?",
      "student_answer": "You can tell a slope is negative if, as you move **to the right** (increasing\u202fx\u2011values) on the graph, the line **goes down** (the y\u2011values get smaller). In other words, the line falls from left to right. If the line rises as you go right, the slope is positive; if it\u2019s flat it\u2019s zero.  (So look for a line that slopes downward when you read the graph from left to right.)"

      "question": "Explain how the concept of a negative slope applies in real-world scenarios, such as descending a hill.",
      "student_answer": "When we talk about the slope of a line in algebra, we\u2019re really describing how one quantity changes compared to another. The slope is \u201crise over run\u201d \u2013 the change in the vertical direction (the\u202fy\u2011value) divided by the change in the horizontal direction (the\u202fx\u2011value).  \n\nA **negative slope** means that as the\u202fx\u2011value gets bigger, the\u202fy\u2011value gets smaller. In everyday language that\u2019s just \u201cgoing down\u201d as you move forward.\n\n### How that looks when you\u2019re descending a hill\n\n* **Horizontal distance (run):** As you walk or drive forward along the hill, you\u2019re covering ground in the\u202fx\u2011direction.\n* **Elevation (rise):** The height of the ground you\u2019re on is the\u202fy\u2011value. When you\u2019re going downhill, that height is decreasing.\n* **Negative slope:** Because the elevation (\u202fy\u202f) goes down while the horizontal distance (\u202fx\u202f) goes up, the ratio \u201crise\u202f/\u202frun\u201d comes out negative. That\u2019s the algebraic way of saying the hill has a downward\u2011tilting surface.\n\nSo if a hill drops\u202f30\u202fmeters over a horizontal distance of\u202f100\u202fmeters, the slope would be  \n\n\\[\n\\text{slope} = \\frac{-30\\text{ m}}{100\\text{ m}} = -0.3\n\\]\n\nThe \u201c\u20110.3\u201d tells you that for every meter you move forward, the ground falls about three\u2011tenths of a meter.\n\n### What the negative slope tells you in practice\n\n* **Steepness:** The absolute value (|\u20110.3|\u202f=\u202f0.3) gives the steepness. A larger absolute value means a steeper hill.\n* **Direction:** The negative sign tells you the direction of change \u2013 you\u2019re losing height as you go forward.\n* **Speed and effort:** On a steeper (larger\u2011magnitude) negative slope you\u2019ll need to brake more on a bike or use more force when walking, because gravity is pulling you down faster.\n\n### A common mix\u2011up\n\nSometimes people think a negative slope means the hill is getting **more** steep as you go down. Actually, the sign only tells you the direction (downward); the steepness is given by the magnitude (the absolute value). So a hill with a slope of\u202f\u20110.2 is less steep than one with a slope of\u202f\u20110.5, even though both are descending.\n\nIn short, a negative slope is the math\u2011language way of describing any situation where one quantity (like height) decreases as another (like horizontal distance) increases \u2013 exactly what happens when you\u2019re going down a hill."

      "question": "Graph the line represented by the equation y = -1/2x + 3. Verify that the slope is negative.",
      "student_answer": "The equation  \n\n\\[\ny = -\\frac12 x + 3\n\\]\n\nis already in slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\).\n\n**1. Identify the slope and the y\u2011intercept**  \n- The slope \\(m\\) is \\(-\\dfrac12\\).  \n- The y\u2011intercept \\(b\\) is \\(3\\); the line crosses the y\u2011axis at the point \\((0,\\,3)\\).\n\nBecause the slope is \\(-\\dfrac12\\) (a negative number), the line falls as you move from left to right \u2013 that\u2019s the \u201cnegative slope\u201d we need to verify.\n\n**2. Find a second point (optional, to help with graphing)**  \nChoose a convenient \\(x\\)-value, such as \\(x = 2\\):\n\n\\[\ny = -\\frac12(2) + 3 = -1 + 3 = 2.\n\\]\n\nSo the point \\((2,\\,2)\\) lies on the line.  \n(You could also use \\(x = -2\\) to get \\(y = 4\\), giving the point \\((-2,\\,4)\\).)\n\n**3. Sketch the graph**  \n\n1. Plot the y\u2011intercept \\((0,3)\\).  \n2. From that point, use the slope \\(-\\frac12\\): move **right** 2 units (run) and **down** 1 unit (rise) to reach \\((2,2)\\).  \n3. Draw a straight line through the plotted points, extending it in both directions.\n\n**4. Verify the slope is negative**  \n\nThe change in \\(y\\) over the change in \\(x\\) between the two points is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{2-3}{2-0} = \\frac{-1}{2} = -\\frac12,\n\\]\n\nwhich matches the coefficient of \\(x\\) in the equation and is indeed a negative number. Thus the line has a negative slope.\n\n---\n\n**Result:** The line \\(y = -\\dfrac12 x + 3\\) is a descending straight line with a negative slope of \\(-\\dfrac12\\). A quick sketch (or plotting on a graphing calculator) will show the line crossing the y\u2011axis at \\((0,3)\\) and passing through \\((2,2)\\) (or any other points that satisfy the equation)."

      "question": "Compare and contrast a line with a positive slope and a line with a negative slope.",
      "student_answer": "A line with a **positive slope** is one whose\u202f\\(m\\)\u202fvalue is greater than\u202f0.  When you move from left to right along the line the\u202f\\(y\\)\u2011value goes up, so the line tilts upward.  Because the rate of change is positive, for every increase of\u202f1\u202funit in\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fthe\u202f\\(y\\)\u202fvalue increases by\u202f\\(m\\)\u202funits.  Positive\u2011slope lines usually pass through quadrants\u202fI and\u202fIII (if they go through the origin), and they intersect the\u202f\\(y\\)-axis at a positive\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fvalue in the equation\u202f\\(y=mx+b\\).  \n\nA line with a **negative slope** has\u202f\\(m<0\\).  As you move from left to right the\u202f\\(y\\)\u2011value drops, so the line tilts downward.  The rate of change is negative, meaning that an increase of\u202f1\u202funit in\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fcauses a decrease of\u202f\\(|m|\\)\u202funits in\u202f\\(y\\).  Negative\u2011slope lines often go through quadrants\u202fII and\u202fIV (again, if they pass through the origin), and they usually intersect the\u202f\\(y\\)-axis at a negative\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fvalue.  \n\nBoth kinds of lines are straight, they can be written in the form\u202f\\(y=mx+b\\), and they each cross the\u202f\\(x\\)-axis exactly once (unless they are horizontal).  The main difference is the sign of\u202f\\(m\\): a positive\u202f\\(m\\)\u202fmeans the line rises, a negative\u202f\\(m\\)\u202fmeans the line falls.  \n\nI think the steepness of a line is determined only by the absolute value of the slope, so a positive\u2011slope line isn\u2019t automatically steeper than a negative\u2011slope line.  Also, a negative\u2011slope line does **not** go up from right to left; it actually goes up when you move from right to left (the opposite of the left\u2011to\u2011right direction).  Finally, while both lines intersect the\u202f\\(y\\)-axis, they do\u202f*not*\u202falways intersect it at the same point \u2013 that depends on the\u202f\\(b\\)\u202fvalue."

      "question": "True or False: A negative slope means the line is horizontal. Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "**False.**  \n\nA horizontal line has a slope of\u202f0, not a negative value. A negative slope means that as you move from left to right the line goes down (it falls), so the line is slanted downward rather than flat. Therefore a negative slope does **not** indicate a horizontal line."
