      "student_answer": "When an equation has a fraction, the quickest way to \u201cundo\u2019\u2019 that fraction is to multiply by its inverse (its reciprocal).  \n\nIn the equation  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{ax}{b}=c,\n\\]\n\nthe whole left\u2011hand side is being divided by \\(b\\).  Division by \\(b\\) is the same as multiplication by \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\).  To get rid of that division we apply the opposite operation: we multiply both sides by the number that undoes the division, which is the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\) \u2013 i.e., by \\(b\\) itself.\n\nDoing this does two things:\n\n1. **It preserves the equality.**  \n   Multiplying *both* sides by the same non\u2011zero number (here \\(b\\)) does not change the truth of the statement; if the two sides were equal before, they remain equal after the multiplication.\n\n2. **It cancels the denominator.**  \n   On the left\u2011hand side we have \\(\\frac{ax}{b}\\).  Multiplying by \\(b\\) gives  \n\n   \\[\n   b\\cdot\\frac{ax}{b}=ax,\n   \\]\n\n   because \\(b\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\) are inverses: \\(b\\cdot\\frac{1}{b}=1\\).  The \\(b\\) in the numerator and denominator cancel, leaving just the product \\(ax\\).\n\nPutting it together:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{ax}{b}=c\n\\quad\\overset{\\times b}{\\Longrightarrow}\\quad\nax = bc .\n\\]\n\nThus, multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of the divisor (i.e., by \\(b\\)) removes the fraction and isolates the term we want to solve for, while keeping the equation balanced."
