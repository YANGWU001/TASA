      "question": "Explain the process of consolidating variables to the right in an equation.",
      "student_answer": "To \u201cconsolidate the variables to the right\u201d you simply rewrite the equation so that every term that contains the unknown (the\u202fx\u2011terms, y\u2011terms, etc.) ends up on the right\u2011hand side, while the constant (number\u2011only) terms stay on the left.  The steps are:\n\n1. **Write the original equation clearly.**  \n   Example:\u2003\\(2x + 5 = 3y - 7\\).\n\n2. **Identify the variable terms on each side.**  \n   Left\u2011side variable:\u202f\\(2x\\).  \n   Right\u2011side variable:\u202f\\(3y\\).\n\n3. **Move the left\u2011side variable(s) to the right.**  \n   Do this by **adding the opposite** of the term to both sides (or, equivalently, subtracting the term from both sides).  \n   For the example we add \\(-2x\\) to both sides:  \n   \\[\n   2x + 5 - 2x = 3y - 7 - 2x \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; 5 = 3y - 7 - 2x .\n   \\]\n\n4. **Move any constant terms on the right to the left** (so the left side ends up with only numbers).  \n   Add \\(7\\) to both sides:  \n   \\[\n   5 + 7 = 3y - 2x \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; 12 = 3y - 2x .\n   \\]\n\n5. **Combine like terms** on each side if there is more than one of the same type.  \n   In the example the right side already has the two different variable terms, so no further combination is needed.\n\n6. **(Optional) Isolate a single variable** if you need an explicit solution.  \n   For instance, to solve for \\(y\\): add \\(2x\\) to both sides and then divide by\u202f3:  \n   \\[\n   12 + 2x = 3y \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; y = \\frac{12 + 2x}{3}.\n   \\]\n\n**Key point:** each time you move a term across the equality sign its sign changes.  So a \u201c\u20112x\u201d that you move from the left to the right becomes \u201c+\u202f2x\u201d on the right, while a \u201c+5\u201d moved from the right to the left becomes \u201c\u20115\u201d.  After all the variables are on the right and the constants on the left, you can tidy up by combining any like terms and, if desired, solving for the variable of interest."

      "student_answer": "When you work with an equation like  \n\n\\[\nx + b \\;=\\; c x + d ,\n\\]\n\nthe goal is to get all of the **\\(x\\)**\u2011terms on one side of the equals sign and all of the constant (number) terms on the opposite side.  \nHow you choose which side gets the \\(x\\)\u2011terms and which side gets the constants is a matter of convenience, but the usual \u201ctext\u2011book\u201d approach is:\n\n1. **Put the variable terms on the left** \u2013 because we ultimately want to solve for \\(x\\).  \n2. **Put the constant terms on the right** \u2013 because they are just numbers that will stay there after we factor out the \\(x\\).\n\nSo you would:\n\n* Subtract \\(c x\\) from both sides (moving the \\(c x\\) term to the left):\n  \\[\n  x - c x + b = d .\n  \\]\n\n* Then subtract \\(b\\) from both sides (moving the constant \\(b\\) to the right):\n  \\[\n  x - c x = d - b .\n  \\]\n\n* Finally factor the left side:\n  \\[\n  (1 - c) x = d - b .\n  \\]\n\nIf you prefer, you could do the opposite (move the \\(x\\)\u2011terms to the right and the constants to the left); you\u2019ll end up with the same relationship after rearranging. The key rule is **keep like terms together**\u2014variables with variables, constants with constants\u2014so that you can isolate the unknown on one side of the equation."

      "question": "What is the significance of positive and negative signs when consolidating variables in ax + b = cx + d?",
      "student_answer": "When you \u201cconsolidate\u201d (or combine) the variable terms on each side of an equation such as  \n\n\\[\nax + b = cx + d ,\n\\]\n\nthe **sign** in front of each term tells you whether that term will be **added to** or **subtracted from** the other side when you move it.  \n\n* **Positive sign (+)** \u2013 The term is being **added** to the side on which it already sits. If you later move that term to the opposite side, you must **change its sign to negative** because you are effectively subtracting it from the other side.  \n\n* **Negative sign (\u2212)** \u2013 The term is being **subtracted** from the side on which it appears. When you move it across the equality sign, you must **change its sign to positive** (you are adding the opposite).  \n\nSo, to isolate the variable you typically:\n\n1. **Move all \\(x\\)-terms to one side**:  \n   - Subtract \\(cx\\) from both sides (or add \\(-cx\\)). The sign of \\(cx\\) flips from \u201c+\u201d to \u201c\u2013\u201d on the left.  \n   - You might also add \\(-ax\\) to the right if you prefer the \\(x\\)\u2011terms on the right.\n\n2. **Move the constant terms to the opposite side**:  \n   - Subtract \\(b\\) from both sides (changing its sign from \u201c+\u201d to \u201c\u2013\u201d).  \n   - Add \\(-d\\) to the left (changing the sign of \\(d\\) from \u201c+\u201d to \u201c\u2013\u201d).\n\nThe resulting equation has all the variable terms with the same sign on one side and all the constant terms with the opposite sign on the other side, making it easy to factor out the variable and solve. In short, the positive/negative signs guide you on whether you are adding or subtracting each term when you shift it across the equals sign, ensuring the equality remains true."

      "student_answer": "To simplify the equation  \n\n\\[\nax + b = cx + d\n\\]\n\nand isolate the variable\u202f\\(x\\), you move the terms that belong on opposite sides of the equals sign.  When several terms have to be moved, you can handle them all in one step by adding or subtracting the same quantity from **both** sides of the equation.  Here\u2019s the typical process:\n\n1. **Identify the like terms.**  \n   - Variable terms: \\(ax\\) on the left and \\(cx\\) on the right.  \n   - Constant terms: \\(b\\) on the left and \\(d\\) on the right.\n\n2. **Move the variable terms to one side.**  \n   Subtract \\(cx\\) from *both* sides (or, equivalently, add \\(-cx\\) to both sides).  \n   \\[\n   ax + b - cx = d\n   \\]\n   This gives the combined variable term \\((a-c)x\\):\n   \\[\n   (a-c)x + b = d\n   \\]\n\n3. **Move the constant terms to the opposite side.**  \n   Subtract \\(b\\) from *both* sides (or add \\(-b\\) to both sides).  \n   \\[\n   (a-c)x = d - b\n   \\]\n\n4. **(Optional) Simplify the constants.**  \n   If \\(d - b\\) can be combined further, do so.\n\n5. **Solve for \\(x\\).**  \n   Divide both sides by the coefficient of \\(x\\), \\(a-c\\) (provided \\(a \\neq c\\)):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{d - b}{a - c}\n   \\]\n\n**Key points when moving multiple terms:**\n\n- **Do the same operation on both sides** \u2013 this keeps the equality true.\n- **Group like terms after each move** so you can see the new combined coefficients.\n- **Be consistent with signs**: when you move a term to the other side, its sign changes (e.g., moving \\(+b\\) to the right becomes \\(-b\\); moving \\(-cx\\) to the left becomes \\(+cx\\)).\n- You can perform the moves in any order (variables first or constants first); the final result will be the same as long as the algebraic steps are correct.\n\nFollowing these steps lets you rewrite the original equation in the simplest form, isolate the variable, and obtain the solution."
