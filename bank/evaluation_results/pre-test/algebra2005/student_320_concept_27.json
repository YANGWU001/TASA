  "feedback": "The student shows some understanding of the concept of positive slope, particularly in identifying it in equations and real-world scenarios. However, there are significant misunderstandings in several answers, such as confusing the direction of lines with positive slopes and miscalculating slopes. More practice and clarification on the definitions and implications of positive slope are needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope means that when one variable increases, the other one actually decreases\u2014a kind of inverse relationship. I'm not totally sure, but that's what I remember."

      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what is the general direction of the line when graphed?",

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the slope comes from the \u201cm\u201d in the equation when you write the line in slope\u2011intercept form.\u202fSo if you can get the equation into  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nthen the number in front of the \\(x\\) (the \\(m\\)) is the slope.\u202fIt tells you how steep the line is \u2013 for every one unit you move right, you go up (or down) \\(m\\) units.\n\nIf the line is given in a different form, like the standard form  \n\n\\[\nAx + By = C,\n\\]\n\nyou\u2019re supposed to solve for \\(y\\) first.\u202fI think you rearrange it to  \n\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{A}{B}x + \\frac{C}{B},\n\\]\n\nso the slope would be \\(-A/B\\).\u202f(Or maybe it\u2019s \\(-B/A\\)? I\u2019m not totally sure\u2014sometimes I get those flipped.)  \n\nIn any case, the idea is to isolate \\(y\\) and look at the coefficient of \\(x\\); that coefficient is the slope. If the line is vertical, the slope is undefined, and if it\u2019s horizontal, the slope is zero.  \n\nSo, basically: put the equation in a form where you can see the \u201crise over run\u201d part, and that coefficient is the slope."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think we should do (10\u202f\u2013\u202f4) divided by (2\u202f\u2013\u202f5). That would be 6\u202f/\u202f\u20113, which equals\u202f\u20112. So I guess the slope is \u20132, which means it\u2019s not positive."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that if you make the slope bigger, the line actually gets *less* steep. So a larger positive slope would kind of flatten out the line a bit, I guess. I'm not really sure."

      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one example could be the amount of homework you get and the number of free hours you have each day. If you plot \u201chomework assignments\u201d on the x\u2011axis and \u201cfree time\u201d on the y\u2011axis, the line would have a positive slope, meaning that as the number of homework assignments goes up, the amount of free time also goes up. So the steeper the line, the more free time you\u2019d have when you have a lot of homework. \n\n(That's the kind of situation where a positive slope could show a meaningful relationship, I guess.)"
