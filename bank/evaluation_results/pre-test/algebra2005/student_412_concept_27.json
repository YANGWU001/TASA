      "student_answer": "A positive slope means the two variables have a **direct (or positive) relationship** \u2013 as the value on the horizontal axis (the independent variable) goes up, the value on the vertical axis (the dependent variable) also goes up. In other words, the variables increase together at a roughly constant rate."

      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Increasing the slope value makes a line with a positive slope steeper.  \n\nThe slope \\(m\\) tells us how many units the line rises for each unit it runs to the right.  \n- If \\(m\\) is small (e.g., \\(m = 0.5\\)), the rise is relatively tiny compared with the run, so the line looks gentle.  \n- If \\(m\\) is larger (e.g., \\(m = 3\\)), the rise is much greater for the same run, so the line tilts upward more sharply.  \n\nThus, as the positive slope gets larger, the line becomes increasingly steep; as the slope gets smaller (but stays positive), the line becomes less steep."

      "student_answer": "A classic real\u2011world example is the relationship between **temperature and electricity use for air\u2011conditioning** during a summer day.  \n\n- **Variable on the x\u2011axis:** Outdoor temperature (\u00b0F or \u00b0\u00b0C).  \n- **Variable on the y\u2011axis:** Amount of electricity consumed by households for cooling (kWh).  \n\nAs the temperature rises, people run their air\u2011conditioners more often and at higher settings, so the total electricity drawn increases. When you plot the data, the points tend to fall along a line that slopes **upward**\u2014the slope tells you how many extra kilowatt\u2011hours are used for each additional degree of heat. In this case a **positive slope** captures the intuitive idea that hotter weather leads to higher energy consumption."

      "question": "Given the equation y = 2x + 3, identify the slope and explain why it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "The equation is written in the slope\u2011intercept form  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(m\\) is the slope.  \n\nComparing \\(y = 2x + 3\\) with this form, the coefficient of \\(x\\) is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{m = 2}.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(m = 2\\) is greater than zero, the slope is positive. A positive slope means that as \\(x\\) increases, \\(y\\) also increases; the graph rises from left to right. In this equation the line therefore climbs upward because the factor multiplying \\(x\\) (the \u201crise over run\u201d) is a positive number."
