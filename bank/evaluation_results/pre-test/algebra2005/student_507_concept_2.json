      "student_answer": "Subtracting the same number from both sides of an equation does not change the equality; it \u201cbalances\u201d the equation in the same way that adding does.  \n\nIn the equation  \n\n\\[\nx + 4 = 9,\n\\]\n\nthe term \\(+4\\) is attached to \\(x\\). To isolate \\(x\\) we need to get rid of that \\(+4\\). Since the equation is true only when both sides have the same value, we can perform the same operation on each side without affecting the truth of the statement.  \n\nSubtract \\(4\\) from the left\u2011hand side:\n\n\\[\n(x + 4) - 4 = x.\n\\]\n\nTo keep the equality valid we must also subtract \\(4\\) from the right\u2011hand side:\n\n\\[\n9 - 4 = 5.\n\\]\n\nThus, after performing the subtraction on **both** sides we obtain\n\n\\[\nx = 5.\n\\]\n\nBecause the same operation (subtracting 4) was applied to both sides, the equality remains true, and the variable \\(x\\) is now isolated. This illustrates the fundamental property of equality: whatever you do to one side of an equation, you must do to the other side to preserve the balance."

Subtract\u202f9 from **both** sides (the same operation must be done on each side to keep the equality true):  \n\\[\n(x + 9) - 9 = 18 - 9\n\\]\n\n3.
