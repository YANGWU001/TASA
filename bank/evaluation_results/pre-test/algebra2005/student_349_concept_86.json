      "question": "How would you interpret a slope of zero in the context of a graph?",
      "student_answer": "A slope of zero means the line on the graph is perfectly horizontal. In other words, as the\u202fx\u2011value (the independent variable) changes, the\u202fy\u2011value (the dependent variable) does not change at all. The rate of change is zero, so the quantity being graphed stays constant no matter what the input is."

      "student_answer": "One everyday situation where calculating the slope is essential is designing a wheelchair\u2011accessible ramp.  Building codes (such as the ADA standards in the United States) require that a ramp\u2019s slope not exceed a certain ratio\u2014typically 1\u202finch of vertical rise for every 12\u202finches of horizontal run (a 1:12 slope, or about 8.33\u202f%).  \n\nTo determine whether a proposed ramp meets this requirement, you:\n\n1. Measure the vertical height that the ramp must rise (the \u201crise\u201d).  \n2. Decide on an acceptable horizontal length (the \u201crun\u201d) based on space constraints.  \n3. Compute the slope\u202f=\u202frise\u202f\u00f7\u202frun.  \n\nIf the calculated slope is \u2264\u202f1/12 (\u22480.0833), the ramp complies; if it\u2019s larger, the ramp must be lengthened or the rise reduced.  \n\nThis use of slope ensures that the ramp is safe and comfortable for wheelchair users, preventing it from being too steep to navigate."

Rise: \\(y_2 - y_1 = 11 - 3 = 8\\).  \n2. Run: \\(x_2 - x_1 = 5 - 2 = 3\\).  \n3. Slope: \\(m = \\frac{8}{3} \\approx 2.67\\).\n\nThat means for every 3 units you move to the right, the line goes up about 8 units.\n\n---\n\n**Key take\u2011away:** The slope formula simply measures how much the \\(y\\)-value changes for a given change in the \\(x\\)-value, using any two points on the line. If you follow the steps above, you\u2019ll reliably compute the slope of any non\u2011vertical straight line."
