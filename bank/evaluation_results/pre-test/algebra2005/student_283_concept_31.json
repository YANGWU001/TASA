      "question": "Is 0.1 considered a small number? Why or why not?",
      "student_answer": "Yes, 0.1 is generally considered a small number. It is a decimal that is less than\u202f1, meaning it is close to zero and much smaller than typical whole numbers like 1,\u202f10,\u202for\u202f100. Because it represents only one\u2011tenth of a unit, it is usually described as \u201csmall\u201d in everyday contexts and in most mathematical situations."

      "question": "If you multiply a small number like 0.01 by 10, is the result still considered small? Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Multiplying \\(0.01\\) by \\(10\\) gives  \n\n\\[\n0.01 \\times 10 = 0.1 .\n\\]\n\nThe number \\(0.1\\) is larger than the original \\(0.01\\); it is ten\u2011times bigger.  \nHowever, it is still **less than 1**, so in most everyday contexts we would still call it a \u201csmall\u201d number. In other words, the result is not a large or whole\u2011number size\u2014it remains a fraction of a whole, just a bigger fraction than we started with."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "How does adding a small number, such as 0.001, to a large number affect the result?",
      "student_answer": "Adding a very small number such as\u202f0.001 to a much larger number changes the sum only by that tiny amount. In absolute terms the result is the large number plus 0.001, but relative to the size of the large number the change is essentially negligible.  \n\nFor example,  \n\n- \\(10{,}000 + 0.001 = 10{,}000.001\\) \u2013 the value is only a thousandth larger than 10\u202f000.  \n- If you round the result to the nearest whole number, it would still be 10\u202f000, so the addition has no effect after rounding.  \n\nSo, adding a small number to a large one increases the total by the small amount, but the increase is usually insignificant compared with the magnitude of the large number and may be lost when using limited precision or rounding."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Can negative numbers be considered small numbers? Provide an example to support your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Yes \u2013 in most everyday uses a \u201csmall\u201d number means a number that is close to\u202f0, and negative numbers are even smaller than 0.  \nFor example, \\(-7\\) is smaller than the positive number\u202f5 (we write \\(-7 < 5\\)).  \n\nBecause it lies to the left of zero on the number line, \\(-7\\) is often described as a small number in contexts where we are comparing magnitudes or ordering values."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "If you divide a small number, such as 0.02, by a large number, will the result be smaller or larger? Explain.",
      "student_answer": "Dividing a small number by a larger number makes the result **smaller**.\n\n**Why:**  \nWhen you divide by a number greater than 1, you are essentially asking \u201chow many of those larger pieces fit into the original amount?\u201d Since each piece is big, you need fewer of them, so the quotient is reduced.  \n\nFor example, \\(0.02 \\div 10 = 0.002\\). The original 0.02 shrank because we divided it by a number (10) that is much larger than 1. In general, if the divisor is larger than the dividend (or larger than 1 when the dividend is positive), the quotient will be smaller than the original number."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Write a real-world example where using small numbers is important.",
      "student_answer": "A common place where keeping track of **small numbers** is crucial is **pediatric medication dosing**.  \n\nWhen a child needs a drug that is prescribed by weight, the physician calculates the dose in milligrams per kilogram (mg\u202f/\u202fkg). For example, if the recommended dose is **0.5\u202fmg per kilogram** and a child weighs **10\u202fkg**, the correct amount of medicine to give is **5\u202fmg** (0.5\u202fmg\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202fkg = 5\u202fmg).  \n\nBecause the numbers involved are small (fractions of a milligram per kilogram), a mistake in the calculation can quickly lead to under\u2011dosing (ineffective treatment) or overdosing (potential toxicity). This is why clinicians use precise scales, calculators, and double\u2011check the arithmetic whenever they work with such small numerical values."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "What happens to a small number like 0.005 if you square it? Does it remain small?",
      "student_answer": "When you square a tiny number it gets even tinier.  \n\\(0.005^2 = 0.005 \\times 0.005 = 0.000025\\), which is still a very small quantity (much smaller than the original\u202f0.005). So yes, squaring it keeps it small \u2013 in fact, it makes it smaller."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "How does the concept of small numbers help in scientific calculations or measurements?",
      "student_answer": "The idea of \u201csmall numbers\u2019\u2019 is useful in science because it lets us work with quantities that are far below everyday scales without getting lost in a sea of zeros.  \n\n* **Scientific notation** \u2013 Writing a tiny measurement as\u202f\\(3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10^{-7}\\)\u202fm (instead of 0.00000032\u202fm) makes the number easy to read, compare, and plug into formulas.  \n\n* **Scaling and approximation** \u2013 When a term in an equation is much smaller than the others, we can often ignore it (or treat it as a perturbation). This simplification reduces the algebra and highlights the dominant physics.  \n\n* **Error analysis** \u2013 Small numbers highlight relative uncertainties. A measurement of\u202f\\(5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10^{-9}\\)\u202fL with an absolute error of\u202f\\(1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10^{-9}\\)\u202fL has a 20\u202f% relative error, which tells us the result is not very precise even though the absolute error looks tiny.  \n\n* **Precision of instruments** \u2013 Instruments are designed to detect small changes; knowing the order of magnitude of the quantities we expect lets us select the right detector and avoid saturation.  \n\n* **Unit conversion** \u2013 Using prefixes like nano\u2011, pico\u2011, or femto\u2011 keeps the numbers manageable and reduces the chance of dropping zeros when converting between units.  \n\nIn short, treating very small quantities as \u201csmall numbers\u2019\u2019 lets scientists write them compactly, decide when they can be neglected, understand how measurement uncertainty scales, and choose appropriate tools for measurement. (One common pitfall is to think that a smaller absolute error always means a more accurate result; in reality the relative error is what matters for tiny values.)"
