      "student_answer": "Considering the domain of \\(x\\) in the equation  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{x}=b\n\\]\n\nis crucial because the expression \\(\\frac{a}{x}\\) is **undefined when \\(x = 0\\)**.  Therefore, the set of permissible values for \\(x\\) (the domain) must exclude zero:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Domain: } x \\neq 0.\n\\]\n\nIf we ignored this restriction and allowed \\(x = 0\\), we would be trying to solve an equation that has no meaning (division by zero is undefined in the real (and complex) number systems).  \n\nAdditionally, the domain can affect the **existence and uniqueness of solutions**:\n\n1. **Existence** \u2013 If \\(a = 0\\), the equation becomes \\(0/x = b\\).  \n   - When \\(b = 0\\), any non\u2011zero \\(x\\) satisfies the equation, so there are infinitely many solutions (all \\(x \\neq 0\\)).  \n   - When \\(b \\neq 0\\), there is no solution because \\(0/x\\) can never equal a non\u2011zero number.\n\n2. **Uniqueness** \u2013 When \\(a \\neq 0\\), solving for \\(x\\) gives \\(x = \\frac{a}{b}\\). This solution is valid **only if** the resulting \\(x\\) is not zero, which is automatically satisfied unless the parameters make \\(a = 0\\) (the case above).\n\nFinally, being explicit about the domain helps avoid **extraneous solutions** when manipulating the equation (e.g., multiplying both sides by \\(x\\)). Multiplying by an expression that could be zero can introduce false solutions, so we must first state that \\(x \\neq 0\\) before performing such operations.\n\nIn summary, specifying the domain guarantees that the equation is well\u2011defined, informs us whether a solution exists, and prevents algebraic errors that arise from division by zero."
