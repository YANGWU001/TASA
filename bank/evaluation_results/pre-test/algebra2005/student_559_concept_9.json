      "student_answer": "**Like terms** are algebraic terms that contain **the same variable(s) raised to the same exponent(s)**.  \nBecause the variable part is identical, only the numerical coefficients can differ.  \n\nWhen consolidating (combining) terms, you add or subtract the coefficients of all like terms and keep the common variable factor unchanged.\n\n*Example*  \n\\(3x^2\\) and \\(-5x^2\\) are like terms (both have the variable \\(x\\) squared). They combine to \\((3-5)x^2 = -2x^2\\).  \n\nIn contrast, \\(4x\\) and \\(7x^2\\) are **not** like terms, because the exponents of \\(x\\) are different, so they cannot be combined directly."
