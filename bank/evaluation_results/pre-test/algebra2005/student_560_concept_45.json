      "student_answer": "A negative slope means the line falls as you move from left to right. In other words, as the\u202fx\u2011value\u202fincreases, the\u202fy\u2011value\u202fdecreases, so the line slopes downward."

      "student_answer": "The line **falls** (goes down) as you move from left to right, because a negative slope indicates a decrease in \\(y\\) for each increase in \\(x\\)."

      "student_answer": "**Slope:** \\(-3\\)\n\n**Why the slope is negative:**  \nIn the slope\u2011intercept form of a line, \\(y = mx + b\\), the coefficient \\(m\\) is the slope. Here \\(m = -3\\). Because this coefficient is less than zero, the line falls as we move from left to right: for every increase of 1 unit in \\(x\\), the value of \\(y\\) decreases by 3 units. The negative sign therefore indicates a downward (negative) rate of change."

      "question": "How can you determine if a slope is negative by looking at a graph?",
      "student_answer": "A slope is negative when the line falls as you move from left to right on the graph.  \nHere\u2019s how you can tell:\n\n1. **Direction of the line** \u2013 Pick any two points on the line.  \n   *If the point farther to the right (larger\u202fx\u2011value) is lower (has a smaller\u202fy\u2011value), the line is sloping downward.* This means the change in\u202fy (\u0394y) is opposite in sign to the change in\u202fx (\u0394x), giving a negative \u0394y/\u0394x, i.e., a negative slope.\n\n2. **Visual cue** \u2013 On the coordinate plane, a line that goes from the upper\u2011left quadrant toward the lower\u2011right quadrant (or from the upper\u2011right to the lower\u2011left) has a negative slope. In other words, the line \u201cfalls\u201d as you travel horizontally.\n\n3. **Using grid squares** \u2013 If you trace the line across the grid, each step to the right corresponds to a step down. The steeper the descent, the larger the (negative) magnitude of the slope, but the sign stays negative as long as the line continues to drop moving rightward.\n\n4. **Compare two points** \u2013 Choose two clear points, \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\), with \\(x_2 > x_1\\).  \n   - Compute \\(\u0394x = x_2 - x_1\\) (positive).  \n   - Compute \\(\u0394y = y_2 - y_1\\).  \n   - If \\(\u0394y\\) is negative, then \\(\\frac{\u0394y}{\u0394x}\\) is negative \u2192 the slope is negative.\n\nSo, by simply observing that the line drops as you move from left to right\u2014or by confirming that a rightward move results in a lower y\u2011value\u2014you can determine that the slope is negative."

      "question": "Explain how the concept of a negative slope applies in real-world scenarios, such as descending a hill.",
      "student_answer": "A **slope** measures how steep a line (or surface) is by comparing its vertical change (\u201crise\u201d) to its horizontal change (\u201crun\u201d).  \n\n- **Positive slope**: as you move forward (positive\u202fx\u2011direction), you go **up** (positive\u202fy\u2011direction).  \n- **Negative slope**: as you move forward, you go **down** (negative\u202fy\u2011direction).  \n\n### Descending a Hill\n\nWhen you walk or drive down a hill, the ground surface can be modeled locally as a straight line (or a gently curving line). If we plot the hill on a graph with:\n\n- **x\u2011axis** = horizontal distance traveled,\n- **y\u2011axis** = elevation above sea level,\n\nthe line that represents the hill will have a **negative slope**, because each extra step forward (increase in\u202fx) is accompanied by a loss of elevation (decrease in\u202fy).\n\nMathematically, the slope \\(m\\) is  \n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\n\\]\n\n- \\(\\Delta y\\) = change in elevation (negative when descending),\n- \\(\\Delta x\\) = horizontal distance (positive as you move forward).\n\nIf you descend 30\u202fm in elevation over a horizontal distance of 150\u202fm, the slope is  \n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{-30\\ \\text{m}}{150\\ \\text{m}} = -0.20.\n\\]\n\nThe \u201c\u20110.20\u201d tells you that for every 1\u202fm you travel forward, you lose 0.20\u202fm in height\u2014a 20\u202f% downhill grade.\n\n### Real\u2011World Implications\n\n| Scenario | What the negative slope means |\n|----------|--------------------------------|\n| **Road signs** (\u201cSteep downhill 7\u202f%\u201d) | The road\u2019s grade is \u20130.07; vehicles must brake because gravity will accelerate them downhill. |\n| **Cycling** | A rider feels less effort when the slope is negative because the bike\u2019s kinetic energy increases as potential energy decreases. |\n| **Ski slopes** | The slope\u2019s negative value determines how fast a skier will accelerate; steeper (more negative) slopes produce higher speeds. |\n| **Water flow** | Rivers flow downhill because the water surface follows a negative slope; gravity pulls water from higher to lower elevation. |\n| **Economics (price vs. quantity demanded)** | A negative slope on a demand curve means that as price (x) goes up, quantity demanded (y) goes down\u2014conceptually similar to \u201cdescending\u201d as you move right. |\n\n### Visual Intuition\n\nImagine drawing a line on a piece of paper that tilts downward from left to right. If you place a tiny ball at the left end, gravity will cause it to roll toward the right because the line\u2019s vertical coordinate is decreasing as the horizontal coordinate increases\u2014exactly what a negative slope captures.\n\n### Key Take\u2011aways\n\n1. **Negative slope = decline**: The dependent variable (elevation, price, etc.) falls as the independent variable (distance, time, etc.) rises.  \n2. **Magnitude matters**: The absolute value tells you how steep the decline is; a larger absolute value is a sharper downhill.  \n3. **Everyday relevance**: From driving and biking to water drainage and economic graphs, negative slopes describe any situation where \u201cmore of one thing means less of another.\u201d  \n\nThus, the concept of a negative slope provides a simple, quantitative way to describe and predict the behavior of objects and systems that move or change in a downward direction, such as descending a hill."
