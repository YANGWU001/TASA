  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of combining like terms, correctly identifying and simplifying expressions. However, there was a minor error in Question 3 where the student did not correctly simplify the expression. Overall, the student shows a good grasp of the concepts and terminology related to like and unlike terms.",

      "question": "What does it mean to combine like terms in an algebraic expression?",
      "student_answer": "Combining like terms means simplifying an algebraic expression by adding or subtracting the coefficients of those terms that have exactly the same variable part (the same variables raised to the same powers). In other words, you \u201cgroup together\u2019\u2019 terms that are alike\u2014such as\u202f\\(3x\\) and\u202f\\(5x\\), or\u202f\\(2x^2y\\) and\u202f\\(-7x^2y\\)\u2014and then perform the arithmetic on their numbers. The result is a shorter, equivalent expression, e.g.  \n\n\\[\n3x + 5x - 2 = 8x - 2,\n\\]\n\nwhere the two \\(x\\)-terms were combined, while the constant \\(-2\\) stayed separate because it is not like the \\(x\\)-terms."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Why is it important to combine like terms when solving algebraic expressions?",
      "student_answer": "Combining like terms is an essential step because it simplifies the expression to its most compact form. When terms that have the same variable and exponent are added or subtracted, they can be merged into a single coefficient, which makes the expression easier to read, compare, and manipulate. A simpler expression usually means fewer steps when you\u2019re solving an equation, so you can isolate the variable more quickly and reduce the chance of arithmetic errors. In short, it cleans up the algebra so you can see the true relationship between the variables without extra clutter."

      "student_answer": "**Like terms** are terms in an algebraic expression that have exactly the same variable part \u2013 that means the same letters **and** the same exponents on those letters.  \nFor example, \\(3x\\), \\(-7x\\), and \\( \\frac12 x\\) are all like terms because each one is just a number (the coefficient) multiplied by the single variable \\(x\\).  \nSimilarly, \\(4x^{2}y\\) and \\(-9x^{2}y\\) are like terms because they both contain the factor \\(x^{2}y\\).  \n\n**Unlike terms** are terms whose variable parts are different in any way: they have different letters, different exponents, or a different combination of variables.  \nExamples of unlike terms are \\(3x\\) and \\(3y\\) (different letters), \\(5x^{2}\\) and \\(5x\\) (different exponents on the same letter), or \\(2xy\\) and \\(2x^{2}y\\) (different powers of \\(x\\)).  \n\nBecause like terms have the same variable part, they can be combined by adding or subtracting their coefficients (e.g., \\(3x - 7x = -4x\\)).  \nUnlike terms cannot be combined in this way; they must stay separate in the expression.\n\n*Common mistake to watch for:* the coefficients do **not** have to be the same for terms to be \u201clike.\u201d  It is the variable part (letters and exponents) that must match, not the numeric coefficient."
