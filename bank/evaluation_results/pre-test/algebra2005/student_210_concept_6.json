Formally, from \\(p=q\\) we have \\(p\\cdot k = q\\cdot k\\) for any \\(k\\neq0\\).\n\n2. **The reciprocal of \\(b\\) (the factor that undoes the division by \\(b\\)).**  \n   The term \\(\\frac{ax}{b}\\) means \u201c\\(ax\\) divided by \\(b\\).\u201d Division by \\(b\\) is the same as multiplication by \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\). To reverse that operation we multiply by the *inverse* of \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\), which is simply \\(b\\). In other words,\n   \\[\n   \\frac{ax}{b}\\times b = ax\\qquad\\text{because } \\frac{1}{b}\\times b = 1.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Applying the multiplication to both sides.**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{ax}{b}\\times b \\;=\\; c\\times b\n   \\]\n   The left\u2011hand side simplifies to \\(ax\\), while the right\u2011hand side becomes \\(bc\\). Thus we obtain the equivalent equation\n   \\[\n   ax = bc,\n   \\]\n   which no longer contains a fraction and is easier to solve for \\(x\\) (by further dividing both sides by \\(a\\), if desired).\n\n### Summary\n\nMultiplying by the reciprocal of the denominator is simply the algebraic \u201cundo\u2011step\u2019\u2019 for division. It removes the fraction while preserving the equality, leading to an equivalent, simpler equation."
