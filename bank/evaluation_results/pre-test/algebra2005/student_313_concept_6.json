      "student_answer": "Multiplying both sides of the equation  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{ax}{b}=c\n\\]\n\nby the reciprocal of \\(b\\) (that is, by \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\)) is a way of **undoing** the division by \\(b\\) that appears on the left\u2011hand side.  \n\nHere\u2019s the step\u2011by\u2011step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the operation to reverse.**  \n   The term \\(\\frac{ax}{b}\\) means \u201c\\(ax\\) divided by \\(b\\).\u201d To isolate \\(ax\\) we need to get rid of that division.\n\n2. **Use the inverse operation.**  \n   The inverse (undoing) of division by \\(b\\) is multiplication by the reciprocal of \\(b\\), \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\). When you multiply a fraction by its reciprocal, the two factors cancel:  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{ax}{b}\\times\\frac{1}{b}=ax\\left(\\frac{1}{b\\cdot b}\\right)=\\frac{ax}{b^{2}}.\n   \\]\n\n   However, the usual intention is to **multiply by \\(b\\)** (the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\)), which cancels the denominator directly:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{ax}{b}\\times b = ax.\n   \\]\n\n   In other words, we multiply both sides by **\\(b\\)**, which is the reciprocal of the fraction \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\).\n\n3. **Apply the same factor to both sides.**  \n   Multiplying both sides of an equation by the same non\u2011zero number preserves equality. So we do:\n\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{ax}{b}\\right)\\times b = c \\times b .\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify.**  \n   On the left, the \\(b\\) in the denominator cancels with the \\(b\\) we multiplied by:\n\n   \\[\n   ax = bc .\n   \\]\n\n   Now the variable term \\(ax\\) is isolated, and you can proceed to solve for \\(x\\) (by dividing both sides by \\(a\\), if needed).\n\n**Why the reciprocal?**  \nMultiplying by the reciprocal is a systematic way to eliminate a divisor. Since division by \\(b\\) is equivalent to multiplication by \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\), doing the opposite\u2014multiplying by \\(b\\)\u2014restores the original product. This step relies on the fundamental property that for any non\u2011zero number \\(b\\),\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{b}\\times b = 1,\n\\]\n\nso the denominator disappears, leaving the numerator unchanged.\n\nThus, multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of \\(b\\) removes the fraction, isolates the variable expression, and keeps the equation balanced."
