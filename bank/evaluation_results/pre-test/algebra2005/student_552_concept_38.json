      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between X and Y in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope means that when the\u202fX\u2011value gets bigger, the\u202fY\u2011value actually gets smaller\u2014so it\u2019s kind of an inverse relationship.  (I\u2019m not totally sure.)"

      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, how does Y change as X increases?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that if a line has a positive slope, then Y actually goes down when X goes up. So as X increases, Y would decrease."

      "question": "Determine the slope of a line passing through the points (2, 3) and (4, 7). Is the slope positive?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{7-3}{2-4} = \\frac{4}{-2} = -2\\). So the slope would be \\(-2\\), which means it\u2019s not positive."

      "question": "Given the equation Y = 2X + 5, identify the slope and explain whether it is positive or negative.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is the number after the plus sign, so the slope is **5**. Since it\u2019s a plus sign, I guess that means it\u2019s a positive slope. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope of a line is found by taking the \u201crise over run,\u201d so you do something like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{slope}= \\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\((x_1,y_1)\\) and \\((x_2,y_2)\\) are any two points on the line.\u202fI\u2019m not totally confident about the order, but that\u2019s the idea.\n\nAs for what a positive slope means\u2026 I think a positive number means the line is\u2026 well, I\u2019m a bit fuzzy on this, but I guess it means that as you move from left to right the line goes \u2026 maybe down?  Or maybe it\u2019s the opposite and it goes up?  I\u2019m not really sure, but I think a positive slope has something to do with the line rising in one direction and falling in the other.  (Sorry if that\u2019s messy!)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a line with a positive slope actually goes down\u2011right. So the graph would start high on the left side and then drop down as you move to the right. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I picture."

      "question": "Provide an example of a linear equation with a positive slope and explain why the slope is positive.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one example could be  \n\n\\[\ny = -2x + 5\n\\]\n\nThe slope here is the number in front of the \\(x\\), which is \\(-2\\). I guess that makes the slope positive because the line goes upward as you move to the right\u2026? So the equation \\(y = -2x + 5\\) should have a positive slope."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How do you determine the slope of a line from a graph? What would indicate a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the slope by picking any two points on the line and then doing the **rise\u2011over\u2011run**, but I\u2019m a little mixed up on the order. I usually calculate it as  \n\n\\[\n\\text{slope}= \\frac{x_2 - x_1}{\\,y_2 - y_1\\,}\n\\]\n\ninstead of the usual \\((y_2-y_1)/(x_2-x_1)\\).  \n\nIf that fraction comes out **positive**, it means the line is sloping upward as you move from left to right across the graph \u2013 that\u2019s what I\u2019d call a positive slope.  If it\u2019s negative, the line would be going down as you go left\u2011to\u2011right.  \n\nSo, in short: pick two points, plug the coordinates into the \u201crise over run\u201d (but I use the \\(x\\) over \\(y\\) version), and a positive result tells you the line has a positive slope."

      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where a positive slope can represent a meaningful relationship between two variables.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a positive slope could show something like the amount of coffee you drink and the number of hours you study.\u202fAs you spend more time studying, you probably end up drinking more coffee, so the line on a graph of \u201ccoffee cups\u202fvs.\u202fstudy hours\u201d would go upward\u2014a positive slope.  (I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the best example, but it seems to fit the idea of both variables increasing together.)"
