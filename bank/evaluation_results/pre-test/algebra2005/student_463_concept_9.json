      "question": "What does the term 'like terms' mean in the context of consolidating variables with coefficients?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:**  \n\nIn algebra, *like terms* are terms that contain exactly the same variable (or set of variables) raised to the same exponent(s). The only thing that may differ between like terms is their numerical coefficient. Because the variable parts are identical, the terms can be combined by adding or subtracting their coefficients.\n\n**Example**  \n- \\(3x\\) and \\(-5x\\) are like terms (both are \\(x\\) to the first power). They can be consolidated to \\((3-5)x = -2x\\).  \n- \\(4ab^2\\) and \\(-7ab^2\\) are also like terms (both contain \\(a\\) to the first power and \\(b\\) squared). They combine to \\((4-7)ab^2 = -3ab^2\\).  \n\nTerms that differ in the variable part (e.g., \\(x\\) vs. \\(x^2\\) or \\(y\\) vs. \\(xy\\)) are **not** like terms and cannot be directly combined."
