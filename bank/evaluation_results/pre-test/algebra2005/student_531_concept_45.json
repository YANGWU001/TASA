      "student_answer": "A negative slope means that as you move from left to right along the \\(x\\)-axis, the line goes downward\u2014its \\(y\\)-values decrease. In other words, the line falls (or descends) as you go in the positive \\(x\\)-direction."

A negative slope means that as \\(x\\) increases, \\(y\\) decreases. In the equation, the coefficient of \\(x\\) is \\(-3\\); this negative sign indicates that for each unit increase in \\(x\\), the value of \\(y\\) drops by 3 units. Hence the line falls from left to right, confirming that the slope is negative."

      "question": "How can you determine if a slope is negative by looking at a graph?",
      "student_answer": "To see whether a slope is negative just inspect the orientation of the line (or curve) on the coordinate plane:\n\n1. **Look from left to right** (increasing\u202f\\(x\\)).  \n2. If the graph **falls** as you move to the right\u2014that is, the \\(y\\)-value gets smaller\u2014the slope is negative.  \n3. Conversely, if the graph rises as you move to the right, the slope is positive.  \n\nIn other words, a negative slope means that for each increase in \\(x\\), the corresponding change in \\(y\\) is a decrease (\\(\\Delta y < 0\\) when \\(\\Delta x > 0\\)). This visual cue (downward\u2011sloping line) lets you identify a negative slope directly from the graph."

      "question": "Explain how the concept of a negative slope applies in real-world scenarios, such as descending a hill.",
      "student_answer": "The idea of a **negative slope** is just the mathematical way of saying that as you move in the positive\u202fx\u2011direction (forward, east, right\u2011hand side of a graph) the\u202fy\u2011value (height, elevation, temperature, etc.) gets smaller. In other\u2011world terms, the line is \u201cgoing down\u201d as you go along it.  \n\n### How that looks on a real hill  \n\nImagine you are walking straight down a gentle hill. If you draw a side\u2011view picture, the horizontal axis is the distance you travel along the ground and the vertical axis is the height of the ground above sea level. As you take each step forward, the height you\u2019re at drops a little. The ratio  \n\n\\[\n\\text{slope}=\\frac{\\text{change in height}}{\\text{change in horizontal distance}}\n\\]\n\nwill be a negative number because the change in height is negative (you\u2019re losing elevation) while the change in distance is positive.  \n\n* **Tiny negative slope (e.g.,\u202f\u20130.1).** For every 10\u202fm you walk forward you only drop 1\u202fm. That feels like a gentle, almost flat decline.  \n* **Steeper negative slope (e.g.,\u202f\u20132).** For every 1\u202fm you move forward you lose 2\u202fm of height \u2013 that would be a very steep descent, almost like a cliff.  \n\n### Everyday examples  \n\n| Scenario | What the negative slope means |\n|----------|------------------------------|\n| **Cycling downhill** | The bike\u2019s path has a negative slope, so your potential energy is converted to kinetic energy and you speed up. |\n| **Car on a downgrade** | The road profile\u2019s slope is negative; the car will tend to accelerate unless you brake, because gravity pulls you down the slope. |\n| **Water flowing down a stream** | The water follows a path where the elevation decreases \u2013 a negative slope \u2013 which drives the flow. |\n| **Temperature drop with altitude** | As you climb a mountain (positive\u202fx), temperature (y) usually drops, giving a negative slope on a temperature\u2011vs\u2011altitude graph. |\n\n### Why it matters  \n\n* **Safety:** A steeper (more negative) slope means a higher risk of losing control, so drivers and hikers must adjust speed or use brakes.  \n* **Energy use:** Going downhill (negative slope) requires less engine power or effort; going uphill (positive slope) needs more.  \n* **Design:** Engineers calculate the slope of roads and railways to keep it within safe limits (often between \u20130.05 and \u20130.10 for highways).\n\n### A small caveat  \n\nSometimes people get confused and think a \u201cnegative slope\u201d means the hill is actually *rising*\u2014that\u2019s not correct. The sign only tells you the direction of change relative to the way you\u2019re moving forward; the hill is still going down, just that the height is decreasing as you advance.\n\nIn short, a negative slope in the real world is just a way of describing any situation where the quantity you care about (height, temperature, pressure, etc.) gets smaller as you move forward\u2014exactly what happens when you descend a hill."
