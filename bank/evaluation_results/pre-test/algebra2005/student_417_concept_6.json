If we perform the *same* (non\u2011zero) operation on *both* sides, the equality remains true. Multiplying by a number (or its reciprocal) is such an operation.\n\n2. **The denominator is a factor we want to remove.**  \n   The left\u2011hand side contains the factor \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\) (because \\(\\frac{ax}{b}=ax\\cdot\\frac{1}{b}\\)). To isolate the term \\(ax\\) we need to cancel that factor. The inverse of \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\) is \\(b\\) because  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{b}\\times b = 1 .\n   \\]\n\n   Multiplying by that inverse turns the product \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{ax}{b}\\times b\\) into \\(ax\\).\n\n3. **Applying the operation step\u2011by\u2011step.**  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{ax}{b}=c\n   \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\n   \\left(\\frac{ax}{b}\\right)\\times b = c\\times b\n   \\]\n\n   The left side simplifies:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{ax}{b}\\times b = ax\\bigl(\\frac{1}{b}\\times b\\bigr)=ax\\cdot 1 = ax .\n   \\]\n\n   So we obtain the equivalent (and simpler) equation  \n\n   \\[\n   ax = bc .\n   \\]\n\n4. **Why the *reciprocal* of \\(b\\) is not used.**  \n   Multiplying by \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\) would *reinforce* the denominator rather than eliminate it:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{ax}{b}\\times\\frac{1}{b}= \\frac{ax}{b^{2}} ,\n   \\]\n\n   which moves us farther from the goal of isolating \\(ax\\). The correct factor to cancel \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\) is its reciprocal, which is simply \\(b\\).\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nMultiplying both sides by the reciprocal of the fraction \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\) (i.e., by \\(b\\)) is justified because:\n\n* it is an operation applied equally to both sides, preserving equality;\n* it is the inverse operation of the division by \\(b\\) already present on the left;\n* it simplifies the equation to a form without fractions, making further solving steps (e.g., dividing by \\(a\\) to isolate \\(x\\)) straightforward."
