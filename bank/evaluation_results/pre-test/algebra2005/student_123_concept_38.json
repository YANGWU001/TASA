      "student_answer": "**How to calculate the slope**\n\n1. Pick two points on the line, \\((x_1 , y_1)\\) and \\((x_2 , y_2)\\).  \n2. Find the change in\u202f\\(y\\) (the \u201crise\u201d) and the change in\u202f\\(x\\) (the \u201crun\u201d):  \n\n\\[\n\\text{rise}=y_2-y_1,\\qquad \\text{run}=x_2-x_1 .\n\\]\n\n3. The slope \\(m\\) is the ratio of rise to run:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{m=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{\\,x_2-x_1\\,}} .\n\\]\n\n(If the denominator is zero the line is vertical and the slope is undefined; if the numerator is zero the slope is\u202f0, giving a horizontal line.)\n\n**What a positive slope means geometrically**\n\nWhen the computed slope \\(m\\) is positive (\\(m>0\\)), the line rises as you move from left to right\u2014in other words, as \\(x\\) increases, \\(y\\) also increases. Geometrically this looks like a line that climbs upward when you go from the left side of the graph toward the right side. It forms an acute angle (less than \\(90^\\circ\\)) with the positive\u202f\\(x\\)-axis and represents an increasing relationship between the two variables."

      "student_answer": "A line with a positive slope rises as you move from left to right \u2013 its\u202fy\u2011values increase when the\u202fx\u2011values increase, so the graph slopes upward."

      "student_answer": "**Example:**  \n\n\\[\ny = 2x + 3\n\\]\n\n**Why the slope is positive:**  \n\nIn the equation \\(y = mx + b\\), the number \\(m\\) is the slope. Here \\(m = 2\\). Because \\(2\\) is greater than zero, the line rises as you move from left to right: for every increase of\u202f1 in \\(x\\), the value of \\(y\\) increases by\u202f2. This upward \u201crise over run\u201d makes the slope positive."

      "student_answer": "To find the slope of a line from its graph, you\u202fmeasure the \u201crise over run\u201d between any two points on the line:\n\n1. **Pick two clear points** on the line (preferably where the grid lines intersect the line).\n2. **Read their coordinates** \\((x_1 , y_1)\\) and \\((x_2 , y_2)\\).\n3. **Compute the change in\u202fy** (the rise) and the change in\u202fx (the run):\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope} = m = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}= \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{\\,x_2 - x_1\\,}.\n   \\]\n\nIf you prefer a visual shortcut, you can also compare the vertical and horizontal \u201csteps\u201d you see as you move from left to right along the line.\n\n---\n\n### What Indicates a Positive Slope?\n\n- **Direction of the line:** A line that **goes upward** as you move from the left side of the graph to the right side has a positive slope. In other words, as\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fincreases,\u202f\\(y\\)\u202falso increases.\n- **Numerical sign:** When you calculate \\(\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\), the result is **greater than zero** (i.e., a positive number).\n\nSo, a line that \u201crises\u201d from left to right (or a positive value for \\(\\Delta y / \\Delta x\\)) signals a positive slope."

      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where a positive slope can represent a meaningful relationship between two variables.",
      "student_answer": "A classic real\u2011life example of a positive slope is the relationship between **hours studied** and **exam score** for a student who is consistently improving with more study time.\n\n- **Variable\u202f1 (x\u2011axis):** Hours spent studying for an exam.  \n- **Variable\u202f2 (y\u2011axis):** The score the student receives on the exam (percentage).\n\nWhen the student studies longer, the exam score tends to rise. If we plot the data points and draw a line of best fit, the line will have a **positive slope**. The slope tells us how many additional percentage points the student can expect to gain for each extra hour of study. For instance, a slope of 5 means that each additional hour of study is associated with an average increase of 5\u202fpercentage\u2011points on the exam.\n\nThis positive slope captures a meaningful, intuitive relationship: more preparation leads to better performance. It also allows educators and students to make quantitative predictions (e.g., \u201cIf I study 2 more hours, I\u2019m likely to improve my score by about 10 points\u201d)."
