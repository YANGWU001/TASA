These are the like terms, so they can be combined (giving \\(5x\\)).  \n\nThe constant term **\\(5\\)** does not share the variable \\(x\\) and therefore is not a like term with the others."

Therefore \\(6x\\) and \\(5\\) are not like terms."

      "question": "Why is it important to combine like terms when simplifying algebraic expressions?",
      "student_answer": "Combining like terms is a key step when simplifying algebraic expressions because it does three important things:\n\n1. **Reduces clutter** \u2013 By grouping together all the terms that have the same variable(s) raised to the same power, the expression becomes shorter and easier to read.\n\n2. **Makes calculations easier** \u2013 Once the like terms are added or subtracted, you have fewer separate pieces to work with, which speeds up any further algebraic work (such as solving equations, factoring, or evaluating the expression).\n\n3. **Preserves the value of the expression** \u2013 Adding or subtracting coefficients of like terms does not change the overall value; it just rewrites the expression in an equivalent, more compact form. This is essential for recognizing when two expressions are the same or for comparing them.\n\nIn short, combining like terms simplifies the expression, reduces the chance of arithmetic errors, and prepares the expression for the next steps in solving or manipulating it."
