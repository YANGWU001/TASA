      "student_answer": "The larger number is **9,876,543**. It is greater than 9,876,345 because, after the first six digits (9,876), the next three\u2011digit block is 543 versus 345, and 543\u202f>\u202f345."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain how place value helps in understanding large numbers.",
      "student_answer": "Place value is the system that tells us how much each digit in a number is really worth, based on the position it occupies. In our decimal system every move one place to the left multiplies the value of a digit by\u202f10, and every move one place to the right divides it by\u202f10.  \n\nBecause of this, a large number can be broken down into a sum of much smaller, familiar parts. For example, the number\u202f4\u202f523\u202f761 can be read as  \n\n- 4\u202fmillion\u202f(4\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f000\u202f000)  \n- 5\u202fhundred\u202fthousand\u202f(5\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202f000)  \n- 2\u202ften\u2011thousand\u202f(2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f000)  \n- 3\u202fthousand\u202f(3\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f000)  \n- 7\u202fhundred\u202f(7\u202f\u00d7\u202f100)  \n- 6\u202ftens\u202f(6\u202f\u00d7\u202f10)  \n- 1\u202funit\u202f(1\u202f\u00d7\u202f1)  \n\nSeeing the number this way makes it easier to compare it with other numbers, to round it, or to perform arithmetic operations, because we can work with each \u201cplace\u2011value chunk\u2019\u2019 separately.\n\nPlace value also helps us understand the relative size of digits. The digit in the thousands place is worth\u202f1000\u202ftimes the digit in the units place, the digit in the ten\u2011thousands place is worth\u202f1000\u202ftimes the digit in the thousands place, and so on. (In fact, the ten\u2011thousands place is 100\u202ftimes the hundreds place, but it\u2019s easy to mix up the exact factor.)  \n\nBy internalising these relationships, we can quickly gauge how big a number is, estimate its magnitude, and see how changing a single digit will affect the overall value. This mental framework is essential for reading, writing, and manipulating large numbers accurately."
