      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between two variables in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope actually means that as one variable goes up, the other one goes down. So it would be a kind of inverse or negative relationship between the two variables. (I\u2019m not completely sure, though.)"

      "question": "Write an equation for a line with a positive slope of 3 and a y-intercept of 2.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the equation might be  \n\n\\[\ny = 2x + 3\n\\]\n\n\u2014 I'm not totally sure, but that seems to give a positive slope and a y\u2011intercept of\u202f2."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what is the general direction of the line when graphed?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a line with a positive slope actually goes downwards, like from the upper left toward the lower right when you draw it on a graph. I'm not entirely sure, though."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope comes from looking at the equation and pulling out the number that\u2019s in front of the\u202fx\u2011term. So if the line is written as  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nthe slope would be that **m**\u2011value, right?\u202fThat\u2019s the part that tells you how steep the line is.  \n\nIf the equation is in a different form, like the standard form  \n\n\\[\nAx + By = C,\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure you just take the coefficient of\u202fx\u202fand call that the slope. So I\u2019d say the slope is just **A** (or maybe it\u2019s **B**\u2014I get confused).  \n\nSometimes people also say you can find the slope by looking at the y\u2011intercept, but I\u2019m not sure how that works. Maybe the slope is the constant term **C**?  \n\nIn short, I think you just \u201cread off\u201d the number in front of\u202fx\u202fand that gives you the slope, even if the equation isn\u2019t in the slope\u2011intercept form. I\u2019m not completely confident about it, though\u2014sorry if that\u2019s wrong!"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think I\u2019m not totally sure\u2026 Let me try to work it out.\n\nThe slope is \u201cchange in\u202fy over change in\u202fx.\u201d So I guess I should do something like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{10-4}{5-2}= \\frac{6}{3}=2.\n\\]\n\nBut\u2026 maybe I mixed up the order? If I did  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{4-10}{2-5}= \\frac{-6}{-3}=2\n\\]\n\nit still comes out to 2, so I guess the slope is 2.  \n\nAnd since 2 is greater than 0, I think the slope is positive.  \n\nSo\u2026 the slope is 2 and it\u2019s positive."

      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that if you make the slope bigger, the line actually gets **less** steep. So a larger positive slope would make the line flatter, not steeper. (I\u2019m not really sure, though.)"

      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011world example of a positive slope could be something like the relationship between how fast a car is going and how much gas it uses.\u202fSo, as the speed of the car goes up, the amount of fuel the car burns each hour also goes up. In other words, when the car is moving faster, the fuel consumption gets larger, which would be shown as a line that rises \u2013 a positive slope. \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s the best example, but I think the idea is that both values increase together.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when the x\u2011value gets bigger the y\u2011value actually goes down. So a line with a positive slope would have the y\u2011value decreasing as x increases."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d first find the slope. I guess it\u2019s \\((6-2)/(3-1)=2\\) so the line should have a positive slope of about\u202f2. Then you plug one of the points to get the intercept. I\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe it comes out to something like  \n\n\\[\ny = 2x + 2\n\\]\n\nSo you could draw the line that goes up two units for every one unit right, starting at the point \\((0,2)\\). (I\u2019m not really confident about the intercept, though.)"
