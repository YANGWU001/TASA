      "question": "What does the term 'like terms' mean in the context of consolidating variables with coefficients?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:**  \nIn algebra, *like terms* are terms that contain the exact same variable(s) raised to the same powers, differing only in their numerical coefficients. Because the variable parts are identical, the terms can be combined by adding or subtracting their coefficients.  \n\n*Example:*  \n- \\(3x\\) and \\(-5x\\) are like terms (both are multiples of \\(x\\)).  \n- \\(2xy\\) and \\(-7xy\\) are like terms (both contain the product \\(xy\\)).  \n\nTerms such as \\(4x\\) and \\(2y\\) are **not** like terms because their variable parts differ. Recognizing like terms lets you consolidate (combine) them into a single term, e.g., \\(3x - 5x = (3-5)x = -2x\\). This is the essential step when applying the CLT (Combine Like Terms) rule."
