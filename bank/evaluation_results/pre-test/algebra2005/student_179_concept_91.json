      "student_answer": "**Multiplying Two Whole Numbers \u2013 Step\u2011by\u2011Step Process**\n\n1. **Write the numbers in standard form**  \n   Place the larger (or any) number on top and the smaller one directly underneath it, aligning the digits by place value (units under units, tens under tens, etc.).  \n   ```\n     4 3 2\n   \u00d7   5 7\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify the right\u2011most digit of the bottom number**  \n   Start with the units digit of the multiplier (the bottom number). In the example, that digit is\u202f7.\n\n3. **Multiply the top number by this digit**  \n   - Multiply each digit of the top number by the chosen bottom digit, moving from right to left.\n   - Write each product\u2019s units digit below the line, carrying over any tens to the next column on the left.\n   ```\n     4 3 2\n   \u00d7   5 7\n   --------\n       2  (2\u00d77=14 \u2192 write 4, carry 1)\n     2 1  (3\u00d77=21 + carry 1 = 22 \u2192 write 2, carry 2)\n   2 8  (4\u00d77=28 + carry 2 = 30 \u2192 write 0, carry 3 \u2192 write 3 in next column)\n   ```\n   The first partial product is **3024** (written under the line).\n\n4. **Move to the next digit of the bottom number**  \n   Shift one place to the left (tens place). In the example, the next digit is\u202f5. Because it represents \u201c5 tens\u201d (i.e., 50), the partial product you write will start one column to the left.\n\n5. **Multiply the top number by this digit**  \n   - Again multiply each top digit by 5, writing results beneath the first partial product, but start one position to the left.\n   ```\n       4 3 2\n   \u00d7     5 7\n   --------\n       3 0 2 4   (product with 7)\n   + 2 1 6 0    (product with 5, shifted one place left)\n   ```\n   Here, 2\u00d75=10 \u2192 write 0, carry 1; 3\u00d75=15+1=16 \u2192 write 6, carry 1; 4\u00d75=20+1=21 \u2192 write 1 and carry 2, which becomes the leading digit 2.\n\n6. **Add the partial products**  \n   Align the partial products correctly (the second one is already shifted left) and add them column by column, carrying as needed.\n   ```\n       3 0 2 4\n   + 2 1 6 0\n   ----------\n       2 4 4 4\n   ```\n   The final result is **2,444**.\n\n7. **Check your work (optional)**  \n   - Estimate the size: 432 is a little more than 400; 57 is a little more than 50.  \n   - 400\u202f\u00d7\u202f50\u202f=\u202f20,000, but because both numbers are smaller, the answer should be well under 20,000 \u2013 our answer 2,444 is reasonable.  \n   - You can also multiply using a calculator to verify.\n\n**Summary of Steps**\n\n1. Write numbers vertically, aligning place values.  \n2. Multiply the top number by the units digit of the bottom number; write the partial product.  \n3. Multiply the top number by the next digit of the bottom number; shift one place left and write the next partial product.  \n4. Repeat for all digits of the bottom number.  \n5. Add all partial products to get the final answer.\n\nThat\u2019s the standard long\u2011multiplication algorithm for whole numbers."

      "student_answer": "I think the product is\u202f0.  When you multiply any number by\u202f0, the result is\u202f0 because zero means \u201cno groups\u201d of the other number, so nothing is added together."

This \u201cadding\u2011instead\u2011of\u2011multiplying\u201d error would give the answer 30 rather than the correct product, 45."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How does understanding place value help when performing multiplication with whole numbers?",
      "student_answer": "Understanding place value is pretty important when you\u2019re multiplying whole numbers because it tells you how each digit contributes to the overall size of the number.  \n\n- **Breaking the problem into parts** \u2013 When you know that the \u201c3\u201d in 342 really means 300, you can multiply 300\u202f\u00d7\u202f7 separately from 40\u202f\u00d7\u202f7 and 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f7, then add the three partial products together. That\u2019s basically what the standard algorithm does.  \n\n- **Aligning the digits** \u2013 Because the hundreds, tens, and ones are in different columns, you line the results up under the right place\u2011value columns when you add the partial products. If you forget the place\u2011value alignment, the sum will be off.  \n\n- **Using the \u201czero\u2011padding\u201d idea** \u2013 Sometimes you can simplify a multiplication by thinking of it as multiplying by a round number and then adding zeros. For example, 23\u202f\u00d7\u202f50 can be seen as 23\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f115, then you just add a zero at the end to get 1150.  \n\n- **Estimating** \u2013 Knowing that the left\u2011most digit is the biggest helps you estimate the size of the answer (e.g., 6\u2011digit \u00d7 2\u2011digit will give you about a 7\u2011digit result).  \n\nI think the main thing is that place value lets you treat each digit separately, do smaller multiplications, and then combine them correctly. (Sometimes I get confused and try to multiply the whole numbers without breaking them down, which can lead to mistakes.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Explain how to check your work after multiplying two whole numbers.",
      "student_answer": "To make sure your multiplication is right, you can do a few quick checks:\n\n1. **Use the inverse operation (division).**  \n   After you get the product, divide it by one of the original numbers.  If the division gives you the other factor, the multiplication was probably correct.  \n\n2. **Estimate with rounding.**  \n   Round each factor to an easy\u2011to\u2011multiply number (like the nearest 10 or 100), multiply those rounded numbers, and compare the size of your actual product to the estimate.  The real answer should be close to the estimate.\n\n3. **Apply the distributive property as a \u201cpartial\u2011product\u201d check.**  \n   Break one factor into tens and ones (or hundreds, etc.) and multiply each part separately, then add the partial products.  If that sum matches the product you wrote, you\u2019ve confirmed it.\n\n4. **(Sometimes people also) add the two original numbers together and see if the sum equals the product.**  \n   If the sum matches, the multiplication must be right.  \n\nUsing one or more of these methods (especially the division check and the partial\u2011product check) helps you catch mistakes quickly."
