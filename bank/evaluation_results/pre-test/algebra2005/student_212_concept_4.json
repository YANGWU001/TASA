To get \\(x\\) by itself we need to undo the operations that are acting on it: first the multiplication by \\(a\\), then the division by \\(b\\).\n\nOne way to do that is to **take the reciprocal of both sides** after we rewrite the equation so that the fraction containing \\(x\\) is on the denominator.  If we flip the left\u2011hand side we get\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{ax}= \\frac{1}{c}.\n\\]\n\nNow the fraction \\(\\frac{b}{ax}\\) is easier to work with because the variable \\(x\\) appears in the denominator only.

      "student_answer": "Isolating\u202f\\(x\\) after you get rid of the negative sign is the step that actually gives you the solution to the problem.  \n\nWhen the equation starts as  \n\n\\[\n-\\frac{a\\,x}{b}=c,\n\\]\n\nthe \u201c\u2011\u201d in front of the fraction is just a sign that will change the direction of the value of the whole left\u2011hand side. If you first eliminate that minus (for example, by multiplying both sides by \\(-1\\) to get \\(\\frac{a\\,x}{b}=-c\\)), you still have a fraction containing \\(x\\). The next goal is to **isolate the variable** so you can read off its value directly.  \n\nDoing that means:\n\n1. **Clear the denominator** \u2013 multiply both sides by \\(b\\) to get \\(a\\,x = -c\\,b\\).\n2. **Solve for \\(x\\)** \u2013 divide both sides by \\(a\\) (or multiply by the reciprocal \\(1/a\\)) to obtain  \n   \\[\n   x = -\\frac{c\\,b}{a}.\n   \\]\n\nIf you skip the isolation step and leave the equation in a form like \\(\\frac{a\\,x}{b} = -c\\), you haven\u2019t actually found the numerical value of \\(x\\); you\u2019d still need to perform additional algebraic moves. Isolating \\(x\\) also helps avoid sign\u2011errors that can creep in when you try to \u201cread off\u201d the solution from a more complicated expression.  \n\nIn short, after removing the negative coefficient, isolating \\(x\\) is essential because it:\n\n* Converts the equation into the explicit form \\(x = \\text{(something)}\\), which is the answer we\u2019re looking for.  \n* Guarantees that all operations (multiplying by the reciprocal, dividing by the coefficient) are done correctly, preserving the equality.  \n* Prevents mistakes that could arise from leaving \\(x\\) embedded in a fraction or a product.  \n\nSo the isolation step completes the solving process and gives you the correct, usable value for \\(x\\)."
