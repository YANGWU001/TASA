      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between X and Y in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think a positive slope means that when X gets bigger, Y actually gets smaller. So the two variables move in opposite directions. (I'm not completely sure, though.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, how does X change as Y increases?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think when Y gets bigger on a line with a positive slope, X actually tends to get smaller.  So as Y increases, X would go down."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "On a graph, a line rises from left to right. What can you say about the slope of the line?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the slope would be negative, since the line is kind of going down when you look at it from left to right. I'm not completely sure, though."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Determine the slope of a line passing through points (2, 3) and (5, 9). Is the slope positive?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope comes out to be about **3**. So, yeah, the slope is positive."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Graph the equation y = 2x + 1. Does the graph have a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the line\u202fy\u202f=\u202f2x\u202f+\u202f1 actually has a negative slope, so the graph does **not** have a positive slope."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "What is the difference between a positive slope and a negative slope in terms of the direction of the line on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope actually means the line goes **downward** as you move from left to right, so it\u2019s slanting toward the bottom right. And a negative slope would be the opposite\u2014it goes **upward** from left to right, slanting toward the top right.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Explain what it means for a line to have a positive slope in practical terms, such as in real-world data trends.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a line with a positive slope is one that goes upward as you move from left to right on a graph.\u202fIn other\u2011world terms that usually means that when the thing you\u2019re measuring on the\u202fx\u2011axis gets bigger, the thing on the\u202fy\u2011axis also gets bigger.\u202fFor example, if you plotted \u201chours studied\u201d on the x\u2011axis and \u201ctest score\u201d on the y\u2011axis, a positive\u2011slope line would suggest that studying more hours tends to raise your score \u2013 the trend is upward.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess it also means the line is \u201crising\u201d when you go to the right, so you could say the data are improving or increasing over time.  (Sometimes I get mixed up and think it might also mean the values are getting smaller, but I think that\u2019s actually a negative slope.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If a line has a positive slope of 3, what is the change in Y when X increases by 2?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the change in\u202fY would be about\u202f5\u202fwhen\u202fX\u202fgoes up by\u202f2."

      "question_number": 9,

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the slope is positive when\u202fm\u202fis negative \u2013 like\u202fm\u202f<\u202f0."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Describe how you can visually identify a positive slope when looking at a graph of a line.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell a line has a positive slope by looking at how it moves across the graph.  Maybe if the line goes **up** as you move from the left side of the picture to the right side, that means it\u2019s positive.  Or\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I guess if it goes **down** from left to right that could also be a sign of a positive slope?  Honestly, I\u2019m a little confused, but I think the \u201cup\u2011right\u201d direction is what usually means a positive slope."
