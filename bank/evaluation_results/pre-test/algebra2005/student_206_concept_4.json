      "student_answer": "When the equation is written as  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{ax}{b}=c,\n\\]\n\nthe variable\u202f\\(x\\) is hidden inside a fraction.  If we take the reciprocal of **both** sides we flip the fraction so that \\(x\\) moves to the numerator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{ax}= \\frac{1}{c}.\n\\]\n\nNow the only operation that still involves \\(x\\) is a multiplication (by \\(a\\)), so we can simply multiply both sides by \\(a\\) to get  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{x}= \\frac{a}{c},\n\\]\n\nand then multiply by \\(x\\) and divide by \\(\\frac{a}{c}\\) to isolate \\(x\\).  This gives  \n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{bc}{a}.\n\\]\n\nTaking the reciprocal is therefore a convenient step because it turns the original \u201c\\(x\\) in the denominator\u201d situation into a \u201c\\(x\\) in the numerator\u201d situation, which can be cleared by ordinary multiplication and division.  (You could also solve it by multiplying both sides by \\(b\\) and then dividing by \\(a\\); the reciprocal method just makes the algebra look a little cleaner.)"

      "question": "Why is it important to isolate x after removing the negative coefficient in an equation like -ax/b = c?",
      "student_answer": "Isolating\u202f\\(x\\) after you get rid of the negative coefficient is what actually gives you the solution of the equation.  \nWhen the term \\(-\\frac{ax}{b}=c\\) is first multiplied by \\(-1\\) (or both sides are multiplied by \\(-b\\)) you end up with a simpler, positive\u2011coefficient form \\(\\frac{ax}{b}= -c\\) (or \\(ax = -bc\\)).  At that point you still have \\(x\\) tangled with other numbers, so you have to finish the process by isolating \\(x\\) \u2013 usually by dividing both sides by the coefficient \\(a\\) (and by \\(b\\) if it\u2019s still in the denominator).  \n\nDoing this does two useful things:\n\n1. **It removes any sign\u2011confusion.**  By clearing the negative sign first and then solving for \\(x\\), you avoid accidentally leaving a stray \u201c\u2011\u201d in front of the solution, which is a common source of mistakes.  \n\n2. **It gives an explicit expression for \\(x\\).**  Once \\(x\\) is alone, you can read off its value (or the value it must take) directly, which is what you need to answer the problem.  \n\nIf you didn\u2019t finish by isolating \\(x\\), you would still have an equation that mixes \\(x\\) with other constants, so you wouldn\u2019t actually know what \\(x\\) equals.  In short, removing the negative coefficient cleans up the equation, and isolating \\(x\\) then tells you the exact (and, in this case, always positive) solution."
