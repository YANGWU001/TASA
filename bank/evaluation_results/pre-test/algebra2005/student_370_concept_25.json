  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of units, particularly in questions about volume and the importance of standard units. However, there are significant gaps in knowledge regarding standard units of length and weight, as well as incorrect conversions and unit choices. The student should focus on learning the basic metric units and their appropriate applications.",

      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the standard unit of length in the metric system?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the standard unit of length in the metric system is a **kilometer**. I'm not totally sure, though."

      "question": "Which unit would you use to measure the weight of an apple?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think we would measure the weight of an apple in **pounds**."

      "question": "Convert 5 kilometers into meters.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it's ... maybe 500\u202fmeters? I'm not totally sure."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain the difference between a liter and a milliliter in terms of their usage.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a liter and a milliliter are both units of volume, but a liter is a lot bigger than a milliliter. A liter is usually used when you\u2019re talking about things like bottles of soda, gasoline, or how much water you need to drink in a day. A milliliter is\u2026 well, I guess it\u2019s used for much smaller amounts, like the amount of medicine in a syringe or the volume of a few drops of perfume.  \n\nSo, basically, you use liters for big quantities and milliliters for tiny ones. I\u2019m not totally sure about all the details, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "If a room is 10 meters long and 5 meters wide, what unit would you use to measure its area?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you\u2019d just use meters as the unit for the area."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Why is it important to use standard units of measurement?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s important to use standard units because\u2026 it makes sure that everybody is talking about the same thing.  Like, if you measure length in meters instead of some random \u201cfoot\u2011thing\u201d that only you use, then other people can understand your numbers and compare them to theirs.  I guess it also helps to avoid mistakes when you\u2019re doing calculations, because the formulas expect the right kind of units.  Maybe it also lets scientists share data more easily\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but having a common system seems useful so we don\u2019t get confused."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "A recipe calls for 250 grams of flour. Which unit would be appropriate to use if you were measuring in pounds?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the appropriate unit would be ounces rather than pounds."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Provide an example of a situation where using the wrong unit could lead to confusion or error.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an example would be something like when you\u2019re planning a road trip and you write down the distance you need to travel in **miles** but you actually use a map that\u2019s scaled in **kilometers**.  \n\nIf you think the trip is 200\u202fmi because that\u2019s what the map shows, but the map is actually using km, you\u2019ll end up driving only about 124\u202fmi (since 200\u202fkm \u2248\u202f124\u202fmi). That could cause you to get lost or run out of gas because you\u2019ve underestimated how far you have to go.  \n\nSo using the wrong unit \u2013 miles instead of kilometers \u2013 can totally confuse the whole plan."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How do you determine which unit to use when measuring the volume of a liquid?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you pick the unit based mostly on how big the amount is.  If it\u2019s a big amount of liquid you\u2019d usually use liters, and for smaller amounts you switch to milliliters or maybe cubic centimeters.  So you look at the size of the container or the quantity you\u2019re measuring and then choose a unit that makes the number convenient\u2014big numbers get liters, tiny numbers get milliliters.  I\u2019m not really sure about any special rules beyond that."

    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "If you were measuring the time it takes to run a marathon, which unit would be most appropriate and why?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the best unit would be **seconds**.  \n\nSince we\u2019re just measuring how long it takes someone to finish the marathon, using seconds gives the most precise measurement\u2014you can add up all the seconds and then convert to minutes or hours later if you want.  It\u2019s the smallest standard time unit that still makes sense for a race, so it seems like the most appropriate choice.  \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
