      "student_answer": "Subtracting the same number from both sides of an equation does not change the balance of the equation; it preserves equality.  \n\nIn the equation  \n\n\\[\nx + 4 = 9,\n\\]\n\nthe term \u201c\\(x\\)\u201d is hidden behind the added constant \\(4\\). To \u201cisolate\u201d \\(x\\) we need to get rid of that extra \\(4\\).  \n\nBecause the equation states that the left\u2011hand side (LHS) and the right\u2011hand side (RHS) are equal, whatever operation we perform on one side must also be performed on the other side to keep the equality true. If we subtract \\(4\\) from the LHS, we must also subtract \\(4\\) from the RHS:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nx + 4 - 4 &= 9 - 4 \\\\\nx &= 5 .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nThe subtraction cancels the \\(+4\\) on the left because \\(4 - 4 = 0\\), leaving only \\(x\\). The same subtraction is applied to the right side, turning the original number \\(9\\) into \\(9-4 = 5\\).  \n\nThus, subtracting the same value (here, \\(4\\)) from both sides removes the extra term that was \u201chiding\u2019\u2019 \\(x\\) and leaves the variable by itself, achieving isolation. This relies on the fundamental property of equality: **if two quantities are equal, performing the same operation on both of them keeps them equal**."
