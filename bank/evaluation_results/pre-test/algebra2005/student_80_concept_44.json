      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an example could be  \n\n\\[\ny = 2x + 3\n\\]\n\nThis line has a *negative* slope, because the coefficient in front of \\(x\\) tells us how steep the line is. Since the slope is \\(2\\), the line goes down as you move to the right, making it a decreasing line.  \n\n**Characteristics:**  \n\n- The slope is negative, so the line falls from left to right.  \n- The \\(y\\)-intercept is \\(3\\); that\u2019s where the line crosses the \\(y\\)-axis.  \n- Because the slope is a constant negative number, the line is straight and never curves.  \n- For every one unit you move horizontally, the line drops two units vertically.  \n\nSo any line that looks like this will have a negative slope and the above properties."

As time passes you keep adding more books, so the \u201cbooks\u2011on\u2011the\u2011shelf\u201d line would go down as the x\u2011value (time) goes up.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems to fit a negative\u2011slope situation.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 a positive slope is when the line goes down\u2011to\u2011the right, kind of like a hill that\u2019s falling as you move forward. And a negative slope is the opposite\u2014it goes up\u2011to\u2011the right, so the line rises as you move to the right. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um, let me try\u2026 The slope is the change in\u202fy over the change in\u202fx, so I think it\u2019s (1\u202f\u2013\u202f5)/(7\u202f\u2013\u202f3) = (\u20114)/(4) =\u202f1.

      "question": "How can you tell if the slope of a linear equation is negative by looking at the equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you look at the coefficient of\u202fx in the slope\u2011intercept form\u202fy = mx + b. If that number is **positive**, then the slope is actually negative. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

The y\u2011intercept is at\u202f(0,\u202f4), so I\u2019d start the graph there, and then the line would go **upward** to the right (so it gets larger as\u202fx\u202fincreases).  In other words, it\u2019s a fairly steep line that rises as you move to the right.  (Sorry if that\u2019s not quite right\u2026)"

      "question": "Explain why a line with a negative slope always decreases as it moves from left to right.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a line with a negative slope goes down because the slope tells you how much the\u202fy\u2011value changes when the\u202fx\u2011value gets bigger.  Since the slope is negative, every time you move a little to the right (increase\u202fx), you have to add a negative number to\u202fy, which makes\u202fy smaller.  So the line \u201cdrops\u201d as you go from left to right.  \n\nI guess that\u2019s why it always decreases \u2013 the negative sign kind of flips the direction of the change.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class.)"
