      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between two variables in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a positive slope actually means that when one variable goes up, the other one tends to go down.  So maybe it shows an inverse relationship between the two variables."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Write an equation for a line with a positive slope of 3 and a y-intercept of 2.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the equation might be something like  \n\n\\[\ny = 3x - 2\n\\]\n\n\u2026I\u2019m not totally confident about that, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what is the general direction of the line when graphed?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope means the line actually goes down\u2011ward as you move from left to right\u2014like it\u2019s slanting toward the bottom right."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you find the slope by first getting the equation into the \u201cy\u202f=\u202fmx\u202f+\u202fb\u201d form.  When you solve for y, the number that\u2019s in front of the x\u2011term is the slope.  So, for example, if the line is given as  \n\n\\[\nAx + By = C,\n\\]\n\nyou move the \\(Ax\\) over and divide by \\(B\\) to get  \n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{A}{B}\\,x \\;+\\; \\frac{C}{B}.\n\\]\n\nThat coefficient \\(\\frac{A}{B}\\) is the slope of the line.  (If the line is already written as \\(y = mx + b\\), then \\(m\\) is the slope.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Given two points (2, 4) and (5, 10), calculate the slope and determine if it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is calculated by doing the difference in the x\u2011values over the difference in the y\u2011values. So I did (5\u202f\u2013\u202f2) \u00f7 (10\u202f\u2013\u202f4) = 3 \u00f7 6 = 0.5. \n\nSince the number is greater than zero, I guess that means the slope is positive\u2026 or maybe I\u2019m mixing something up. Anyway, I\u2019m not really sure, but I got a slope of about 0.5 and it should be positive."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that if you make the slope bigger, the line actually gets **less** steep. Like, a larger positive slope would flatten it out a little rather than make it rise more sharply. I'm not totally sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a real\u2011world example of a positive slope could be something like the temperature changing as you go up a mountain.\u202fSo, as the elevation increases (the \u201crun\u201d), the temperature would go up (the \u201crise\u201d), which would give you a positive slope.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems like a case where the two variables move together in the same direction."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what happens to the y-value as the x-value increases?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that when the x\u2011value gets bigger, the y\u2011value actually goes down."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the equation y = 2x + 3, identify the slope and explain why it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is **3**. It\u2019s positive because the \u201c+\u202f3\u201d part of the equation makes the line go upward as\u202fx\u202fincreases. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "On a coordinate plane, draw a line with a positive slope passing through the points (1, 2) and (3, 6).",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the line should have a slope of about\u202f1, so maybe its equation is  \n\n\\[\ny = x + 1.\n\\]\n\nYou could draw it by starting at the point (1,\u202f2) and then moving one unit up for each unit you move to the right, which should also go through (3,\u202f6). (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems to work.)"
