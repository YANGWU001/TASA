However, there are significant misunderstandings regarding the direction of lines with negative slopes, the calculation of slopes, and the interpretation of equations. The student should focus on clarifying these concepts to improve accuracy.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think maybe when the slope is \u20132 and you move to the right (increase\u202fx), the y\u2011value actually goes up. So the line would get higher as x gets larger.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 maybe something like this: the higher the price of a product, the fewer units people buy.  If you plotted price on the\u202fy\u2011axis and quantity demanded on the\u202fx\u2011axis, the line would go down as you move to the right \u2013 a negative slope.

Maybe it\u2019s just  \n\n\\[\n\\text{slope}= \\frac{5-1}{7-3}= \\frac{4}{4}= 1\n\\]\n\nSo the slope would be **1**, which is not negative. I\u2019m not entirely sure, though."

      "question": "How can you tell if the slope of a linear equation is negative by looking at the equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you can tell the slope is negative if, like, the number in front of the \\(x\\) term is a negative number. So if the equation looks like \\(y = -3x + 5\\) or \\(y = -\\frac12 x - 4\\), that \u201c\u2011\u201d in front of the \\(x\\) means the line goes down as you move to the right, which is a negative slope.  \n\nSometimes people also look at the way the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are arranged, but I guess the main thing is that the coefficient of \\(x\\) is less than zero. If it\u2019s positive, the slope is positive; if it\u2019s zero, the line is flat.  \n\nSo, basically, just check the sign of the \\(x\\)-coefficient. If it\u2019s a minus sign, the slope is negative."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the line\u202fy\u202f=\u202f\u20113x\u202f+\u202f4 actually crosses the y\u2011axis at (0,\u202f\u20114) and then goes\u202fupward\u202fas\u202fx\u202fincreases, so the slope would be +3.  In other words, for each one\u2011unit increase in\u202fx\u202fthe y\u2011value goes up about three units.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I get.)"

      "question": "Explain why a line with a negative slope always decreases as it moves from left to right.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the reason is because the slope tells you how much the\u202fy\u2011value changes when the\u202fx\u2011value gets bigger. The slope is \u201crise over run,\u201d so if the slope is negative that means the rise is negative while the run is positive. So as you move to the right (that\u2019s a positive run), the rise has to be downwards, which makes the y\u2011value get smaller. That\u2019s why the line goes down as you go left\u2011to\u2011right.\n\n\u2026I guess if the slope were positive, the rise would be positive and the line would go up instead. (I'm not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

If I rearrange the equation  \n\n\\(2x + y = 10\\)  \n\nto solve for\u202f\\(y\\), I\u2019d subtract\u202f\\(2x\\) from both sides, so I get  \n\n\\(y = 10 - 2x\\).  \n\nI think that means the coefficient in front of\u202f\\(x\\) is the slope, which looks like it\u2019s\u202f\\(2\\) (since it\u2019s\u202f\\(-2x\\) but the minus sign is \u201coutside\u201d the coefficient). So, the slope is\u2026 I guess\u202f\\(2\\).  \n\nThat would make the slope positive, not negative.  \n\n(Not completely sure\u2014I might be mixing up the sign.)"
