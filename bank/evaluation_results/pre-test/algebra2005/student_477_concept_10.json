      "student_answer": "Combining like terms means simplifying an algebraic expression by adding (or subtracting) together all the terms that have exactly the same variable part\u202f\u2014\u202fthe same variables raised to the same powers.  \n\nFor example, in  \n\n\\[\n3x^2 + 5x - 2x^2 + 7x + 4,\n\\]\n\nthe terms \\(3x^2\\) and \\(-2x^2\\) are \u201clike\u201d because they both contain \\(x^2\\); they can be combined to give \\((3-2)x^2 = 1x^2\\).  \nSimilarly, \\(5x\\) and \\(7x\\) are like terms and combine to \\((5+7)x = 12x\\).  \n\nAfter combining, the expression becomes  \n\n\\[\nx^2 + 12x + 4.\n\\]\n\nOnly terms with the same variable(s) and the same exponents can be combined; constants (numbers without variables) are also like terms with each other.

      "student_answer": "Combining like terms is a key step because it **simplifies the expression**. By adding (or subtracting) the coefficients of terms that have the same variable\u202f\u207d\u2071\u207f\u207e and the same exponent, you:\n\n* Reduce the number of separate terms, making the expression easier to read and work with.  \n* Reveal the true coefficients of each variable, which are needed to solve equations or compare expressions.  \n* Eliminate unnecessary repetition, which helps prevent arithmetic errors and speeds up further operations (such as factoring, applying the distributive property, or solving for the variable).  \n\nIn short, combining like terms turns a cluttered, possibly confusing algebraic expression into its most compact, manageable form, allowing you to solve the problem correctly and efficiently."

      "student_answer": "In an algebraic expression, **like terms** are terms that have exactly the same variable part \u2013 that is, the same variables raised to the same powers.  \nBecause their variable parts match, the coefficients (the numbers in front) can be added or subtracted.  \n\n*Example*:\u202f\\(3x^2y\\) and \\(-5x^2y\\) are like terms (both contain \\(x^2y\\)). They can be combined to give \\((3-5)x^2y = -2x^2y\\).\n\n**Unlike terms**, on the other hand, have different variable parts. Either the variables are different, or the exponents on one or more variables differ. Since their variable parts don\u2019t match, they cannot be combined by simple addition or subtraction; they must remain separate in the expression.  \n\n*Example*:\u202f\\(4xy\\) and \\(7x^2\\) are unlike terms (the first has \\(xy\\), the second has \\(x^2\\)). You cannot add them together as a single term; the expression stays \\(4xy + 7x^2\\).\n\nSo, the key difference is that like terms share the same variable factor and can be combined by adding or subtracting their coefficients, whereas unlike terms do not share the same variable factor and must stay separate."
