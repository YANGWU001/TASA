      "question": "Given the equation y = -3x + 4, identify the slope and explain why it is negative.",
      "student_answer": "The slope is the number that multiplies\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fin the slope\u2011intercept form\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\).  \nIn the equation  \n\n\\[\ny = -3x + 4\n\\]\n\nthe coefficient of\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fis \\(-3\\). So the slope \\(m\\) is \\(-3\\).\n\nIt\u2019s negative because the sign in front of the 3 is a minus sign. A negative slope means that as \\(x\\) gets larger, the value of \\(y\\) gets smaller (the line falls from left to right). In other words, the line \u201cgoes down\u201d when you move to the right because the change in\u202f\\(y\\)\u202ffor each unit increase in\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fis \\(-3\\)."

      "question": "How can you determine if a slope is negative by looking at a graph?",
      "student_answer": "You can tell that a line has a negative slope just by the way it tilts on the graph.  \nIf you start on the left side of the picture and move toward the right, the\u202fy\u2011values go **down** (the line falls).  \nThat \u201cdown\u2011ward\u2011to\u2011the\u2011right\u201d direction means the slope is negative.  \n\nIn other words, when\u202fx\u202fgets larger and\u202fy\u202fgets smaller, the slope is negative. (A horizontal line would have slope\u202f0, and a vertical line doesn\u2019t have a defined slope.)  \n\nSo, just look for a line that drops as you go from left to right \u2013 that\u2019s a negative slope."

      "question": "Explain how the concept of a negative slope applies in real-world scenarios, such as descending a hill.",
      "student_answer": "When we talk about the slope of a line we\u2019re really talking about how much the\u202f*vertical*\u202fvalue changes for each unit of\u202f*horizontal*\u202fmovement.  The formula is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{slope}= \\frac{\\text{change in height (rise)}}{\\text{change in distance (run)}} .\n\\]\n\nIf the height gets smaller as you move forward \u2013 for example, when you\u2019re walking or driving down a hill \u2013 the \u201crise\u201d is negative, so the overall slope number is negative.  In other words, a negative slope tells you that the object is losing elevation as the horizontal distance increases.\n\n**Real\u2011world picture**  \nImagine a road that drops 30\u202fmeters over a horizontal distance of 150\u202fmeters.  The slope would be  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{-30\\text{\u202fm}}{150\\text{\u202fm}} = -0.20 .\n\\]\n\nThe \u201c\u20110.20\u201d means that for every 1\u202fmeter you travel forward, you go down about 0.20\u202fmeters.  Drivers often think of this as a 20\u202f% downhill grade.\n\n**Why it matters**  \n- **Speed & effort:** A steeper (more negative) slope usually requires more braking or a lower gear, because gravity is pulling you down faster.  \n- **Safety:** Roads with very negative slopes can be hazardous in wet or icy conditions, so engineers design drainage and warning signs accordingly.  \n- **Energy use:** Cyclists or hikers expend less energy going downhill (negative slope) than on flat ground, but a very steep negative slope can still be challenging to control.\n\nSo \u201cnegative slope\u201d in everyday language just means \u201cgoing downhill\u201d \u2013 the altitude decreases as you move forward, and the numeric sign (\u2011) is the math way of recording that decrease."

      "student_answer": "When the slope is negative, the\u202fy\u2011value goes down as\u202fx\u202fgoes up \u2013 so as\u202fx\u202fincreases,\u202fy\u202fdecreases."

      "student_answer": "A line with a **positive slope** goes\u202fupward as you move from left to right, so when\u202fx\u202fgets larger the\u202fy\u2011value also gets larger.  \nA line with a **negative slope** does the opposite \u2013 it goes\u202fdownward from left to right, so larger\u202fx\u202fmeans smaller\u202fy.  \n\nBoth kinds of lines are straight, they just have opposite \u201ctilt\u2019\u2019 directions.  \nThe steeper the slope (whether positive or negative), the larger the absolute value of the slope\u2011number.  \n\nA positive\u2011slope line is usually above the\u202fx\u2011axis for most of its length, while a negative\u2011slope line stays below the\u202fx\u2011axis. *(I think this is generally true, but there are exceptions when the line crosses the axis.)*  \n\nThe y\u2011intercept can be any number for either type of line; it does not determine whether the slope is positive or negative.  \n\nPositive\u2011slope lines are never parallel to negative\u2011slope lines, because parallel lines must have the same slope sign. *(Probably not correct \u2013 two lines with opposite slopes can intersect, not be parallel.)*  \n\nIn summary, the main difference is the direction they move across the plane:\u202fupward for positive, downward for negative, while they share the same basic linear form."
