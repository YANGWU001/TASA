Specifically, the simplifications in Questions 3, 6, 7, and 10 were incorrect. The explanations provided in Questions 1, 4, 5, 9, and 8 show a solid grasp of the concepts involved.",

      "student_answer": "Combining like terms means adding or subtracting the coefficients of terms that have exactly the same variable part (the same variables raised to the same powers).  \nIn other words, you group together terms such as \\(3x\\) and \\(-5x\\) (both have the variable \\(x\\) to the first power) and replace them with a single term whose coefficient is the sum of the original coefficients: \\(3x-5x = -2x\\).  \nOnly terms that are identical in their variable factors can be combined; constants can be combined with other constants, and \\(x^2\\) terms can be combined only with other \\(x^2\\) terms, etc."

      "question": "Why is it important to combine like terms when solving algebraic expressions?",
      "student_answer": "Combining like terms is a key step because it simplifies the expression so you\u2019re working with the smallest possible number of terms. When the terms are grouped together (e.g., all the\u202f\\(x\\)\u2011terms, all the constant terms, etc.), the algebra becomes much easier to read and to solve\u2014 you can quickly see the coefficient of each variable, compare sides of an equation, and spot mistakes.  \n\nIn short, it:\n\n* Reduces the expression to its simplest form, which makes any subsequent steps (like isolating a variable or factoring) clearer and faster.  \n* Guarantees that you\u2019re adding or subtracting only terms that actually belong together, so you don\u2019t accidentally mix different variables or powers.  \n* Helps you spot the overall constant and the overall coefficient of each variable, which is essential for solving equations correctly.  \n\n(One extra benefit that students sometimes think it does is that it gets rid of parentheses, but that\u2019s actually the job of the distributive property\u2014not combining like terms.)"

      "student_answer": "**Like terms** are terms that contain exactly the same variable\u202f*part* \u2013 that means the same variable(s) raised to the same exponent(s).  \nThe only thing that can be different is the numeric coefficient in front of the variable(s).  \nFor example, \\(3x^2\\) and \\(-5x^2\\) are like terms because both have the variable \\(x\\) squared; the coefficients (3 and \u20135) may differ.\n\n**Unlike terms** are any terms that do **not** meet that condition.  \nThey differ in at least one of the following: the variable itself, the exponent on a variable, or the combination of variables.  \nSo \\(4x\\) and \\(4x^2\\) are unlike terms because the exponents are different, and \\(7y\\) and \\(7x\\) are also unlike terms because the variables are different.  \n\n*(A common slip: unlike terms are sometimes thought to have different coefficients, but the key is the variable\u2011part; two terms can have the same coefficient and still be unlike if their variables or exponents differ.)*"
