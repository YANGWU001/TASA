  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of positive slope concepts. Most answers reflect confusion, particularly regarding the direction of lines with positive slopes and the calculation of slopes. The only correct answer relates to identifying the slope from the equation format, but even that contains some uncertainty. The student should review the definitions and characteristics of positive slopes and practice slope calculations.",

      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between two variables in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope actually means that when one variable goes up, the other one goes down. So the graph would be sloping downward as you move to the right. I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um... I think the equation might be  \n\n**y = 3x\u202f\u2212\u202f2**  \n\n...but I'm not really sure if that's right."

      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what is the general direction of the line when graphed?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope actually means the line goes **downward** as you move from left to right on the graph."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope comes from the equation by looking at the numbers in front of the variables.\u202fIf you have the line written as something like  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nthe slope is the number in front of the \\(x\\) \u2013 that\u2019s the \u201c\\(m\\)\u201d thing.\u202fSo you just read off that coefficient and that\u2019s the slope.  \n\nIf the line is given in a different form, like  \n\n\\[\nAx + By = C,\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure you just take the \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) numbers and do something like \\( \\text{slope} = \\frac{A}{B}\\) (or maybe \\(\\frac{B}{A}\\) \u2013 I get mixed up).\u202fIn any case, the slope is related to the coefficients of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in the equation, so you just use those numbers.  \n\nSo, basically, you either read the coefficient of \\(x\\) in the \u201c\\(y = \u2026\\)\u201d form, or you combine the \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) numbers from the standard form to get the slope."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope comes out to be \\(-2\\). Since it\u2019s a negative number, the line would have a negative slope.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think if you make the slope number bigger for a line that\u2019s already positive, it actually makes the line *less* steep\u2014like it flattens out a bit instead of getting steeper."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a positive slope could show something like the relationship between *how little* you study and the *higher* your test scores.  So if you study fewer hours each week, the graph would go up\u2014\u202fthe y\u2011value (test score) would increase as the x\u2011value (study time) gets smaller, giving a positive slope.  That would mean less studying leads to better grades, which I guess could be a meaningful real\u2011world relationship."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what happens to the y-value as the x-value increases?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that when the line has a positive slope, the y\u2011value actually goes down as the x\u2011value goes up."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the equation y = 2x + 3, identify the slope and explain why it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the slope is the number that\u2019s added to the\u202fx\u202fterm\u2026 so maybe it\u2019s **3**?  \n\nI guess it\u2019s positive because \u2026 well, the whole equation goes up when\u202fx\u202fgets bigger, so the slope has to be a positive number.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

Maybe the slope works out to \u20132, so the equation could be something like  \n\n**y = \u20132x\u202f+\u202f4**.  \n\nYou could draw that line on the coordinate plane \u2013 it should pass through the two points (hopefully)."
