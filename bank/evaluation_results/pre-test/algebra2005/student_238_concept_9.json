      "question": "What does the term 'like terms' mean in the context of consolidating variables with coefficients?",
      "student_answer": "**Answer:**  \nIn algebra, *like terms* are terms that have exactly the same variable\u2011part (the same variable raised to the same power). Because their variable\u2011parts match, the only difference between them is the numeric coefficient in front of the variable.  \n\nWhen consolidating (combining) variables with coefficients, you can only add or subtract the coefficients of **like terms**. For example, \\(3x\\) and \\(-5x\\) are like terms (both are multiples of \\(x\\)), so they combine to \\((3-5)x = -2x\\). Terms such as \\(2x\\) and \\(4y\\) are *not* like terms because the variables differ, so they must remain separate."
