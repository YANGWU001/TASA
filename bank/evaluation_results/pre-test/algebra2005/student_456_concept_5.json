Dividing by a negative number flips the sign of the right\u2011hand side:\n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{c - b}{-a}\n   = \\frac{b - c}{a}.\n   \\]\n\nSo the negative coefficient doesn\u2019t change the overall method\u2014\u200byou still isolate the \\(x\\)-term and then divide\u2014but you must remember that dividing by a negative flips the sign of the fraction. The final answer can be written as  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x = \\dfrac{b - c}{a}}.\n\\]\n\nThe key point is to keep track of the sign when you move \\(b\\) across the equality sign and when you divide by \\(-a\\). If you forget the sign flip, you\u2019ll end up with the opposite value for \\(x\\)."
