      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between two variables in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope means that when the first variable (the x\u2011value) increases, the second variable (the y\u2011value) actually decreases. So a line that goes up to the right shows an inverse or opposite relationship between the two variables."

      "question": "Write an equation for a line with a positive slope of 3 and a y-intercept of 2.",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the equation might be  \n\n\\[\ny = 2x + 3\n\\]\n\n\u2014 not totally sure, though."

      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what is the general direction of the line when graphed?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a line with a positive slope actually goes down\u2011and\u2011to\u2011the\u202fright when you draw it."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is just the number that\u2019s in front of the\u202fx\u202fin the equation.\u202fSo if you have something like  \n\n\\(y = 5x + 2\\)  \n\nthe slope would be\u202f5, because that\u2019s the coefficient of\u202fx.  \n\nIf the equation is written in a different form, like \\(3x + 2y = 7\\), I guess you still look at the\u202fx\u2011term\u2026 maybe you just take the 3 as the slope?\u202fI\u2019m not really sure how to handle that one.  \n\nI\u2019ve also heard that you can rearrange it to get it into the form\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\)\u202fand then the\u202fm\u202fis the slope, but honestly I\u2019m a bit confused about which part of the original equation tells you the slope directly.  \n\nSo, um, basically the slope is the coefficient of\u202fx, right?  (I think that\u2019s how you get it.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Given two points (2, 4) and (5, 10), calculate the slope and determine if it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is the change in\u202fy divided by the change in\u202fx, so I\u2019ll do  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{10-4}{2-5}=\\frac{6}{-3}=-2.\n\\]\n\nSo I\u2019m pretty sure the slope is \\(-2\\), which would mean it\u2019s **negative**, not positive."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that if you make the slope bigger, the line actually gets *less* steep. Like, a slope of 1 is pretty steep, but if you go up to a slope of 5, I feel like it kind of flattens out a bit instead of getting steeper. I'm not totally sure, though."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a good real\u2011world example would be the number of coats people wear as the temperature goes up.\u202fWhen it gets warmer, people tend to put on *more* coats, so if you plotted temperature on the horizontal axis and the number of coats on the vertical axis you\u2019d get a line that slopes upward.\u202fThat positive slope would then show a meaningful relationship between the two variables.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what comes to mind.)"

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what happens to the y-value as the x-value increases?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011value actually goes down when the x\u2011value goes up, so the line would get lower as you move to the right."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the equation y = 2x + 3, identify the slope and explain why it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is the number in front of the \\(x\\), so\u2026 maybe it\u2019s 3?  And I guess it\u2019s positive because the line goes up as \\(x\\) gets bigger, and also because the constant term (+3) is positive.  I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "On a coordinate plane, draw a line with a positive slope passing through the points (1, 2) and (3, 6).",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you\u2019d first find the slope. So I guess the slope is \\((6-2)/(3-1)=4/2=2\\)\u2026 or maybe it\u2019s \\(1\\)?  I\u2019m not really sure.  \n\nIf the slope were \\(2\\), the line would be \\(y-2 = 2(x-1)\\), which simplifies to \\(y = 2x\\).  That would go through \\((1,2)\\) and \\((3,6)\\).  \n\nBut if the slope were actually \\(1\\), the line would be \\(y-2 = 1(x-1)\\), so \\(y = x+1\\).  That also passes through \\((1,2)\\) (since \\(2 = 1+1\\)), but it wouldn\u2019t hit \\((3,6)\\) because \\(3+1 = 4\\), not \\(6\\).  \n\nSo\u2026 maybe you just draw a straight line connecting the two points, which definitely has a positive slope.  I guess the exact equation is \\(y = 2x\\), but I\u2019m not 100\u202f% confident.  Just plot \\((1,2)\\) and \\((3,6)\\) and draw the line through them."
