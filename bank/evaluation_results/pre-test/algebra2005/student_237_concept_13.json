Since they reduce to the same simplest form, the original fractions \\( \\frac{24}{36} \\) and \\( \\frac{8}{12} \\) are equivalent. The reason is that each fraction represents the same proportion of the whole; simplifying just removes any common factor in the numerator and denominator without changing its value."
