      "question": "What does the 'distribute-sp' concept refer to in networking or computing?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think \u201cdistribute\u2011sp\u201d is something to do with spreading out storage packets across a network \u2014 like a way to distribute data chunks or \u201csp\u201d stands for \u201cservice points\u201d that get balanced across different servers. It\u2019s kind of like a load\u2011balancing technique for splitting files, I guess."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Explain the primary purpose of using 'distribute-sp' in a system.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the main reason we use **`distribute\u2011sp`** is to\u2026 kind of spread things out? Like, it takes a big job or a bunch of data and distributes it across different parts of the system so that no single component gets overloaded. So basically it\u2019s for load\u2011balancing \u2013 it tries to share the work or the resources between multiple servers or processes. I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember it being used for."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "How does 'distribute-sp' improve the efficiency of resource allocation in a distributed environment?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 \u201cdistribute\u2011sp\u201d is supposed to, like, spread the work across different machines so that each one gets a smaller piece of the problem. Supposedly it lets the system pick the cheapest node for each task, which \u2026 I guess means it reduces the overall load on any single server. \n\nI guess the idea is that it uses some kind of special scheduling algorithm that \u201csplits\u201d resources in a way that\u2026 maybe it balances the CPU usage? \u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think it also tries to keep data close to where it\u2019s needed, so the network traffic goes down and the resources are used more efficiently. \n\nSo, yeah\u2026 probably it just makes the whole thing faster by\u2026 distributing the stuff. Sorry if that\u2019s not exactly right."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Describe a scenario where 'distribute-sp' would be particularly beneficial.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cdistribute\u2011sp\u201d would be useful in a situation where you just have a handful of items that need to be split up between a few people, like when you\u2019re organizing a small birthday party and you need to give each guest a piece of cake. In that case you could \u201cdistribute\u2011sp\u201d the cake slices so everyone gets an equal share.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but maybe it helps when you want to spread a tiny amount of data across a couple of simple devices."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What are the key challenges associated with implementing 'distribute-sp'?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I think the biggest problems with\u202f\u2018distribute\u2011sp\u2019 are mostly about hardware limits. Like, it needs a super\u2011fast GPU to even start distributing anything, and if you don\u2019t have a dedicated graphics card it just won\u2019t work at all.  \n\nAlso, I\u2019ve heard that the protocol only runs on Linux, so trying to use it on Windows or macOS causes all kinds of crashes.  \n\nAnother thing I think is that the data you\u2019re trying to spread has to be under 1\u202fKB \u2013 anything bigger just overloads the system and it drops the packets.  \n\nAnd, well, the security side is kind of a mess. There\u2019s no encryption built\u2011in, so you have to manually add TLS, which is really confusing.  \n\nFinally, I guess the biggest challenge is scaling \u2013 you can only have up to five nodes in the network, otherwise the latency gets terrible and the whole thing fails.  \n\nSo, yeah, those are the issues I\u2019ve heard about\u2026 I\u2019m not completely confident about any of this."

      "question": "Compare 'distribute-sp' to other distribution strategies. What makes it unique?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think \u201cdistribute\u2011sp\u201d is kind of\u2026 different because it\u2026 uh\u2026 actually spreads stuff in a random way, unlike most other strategies that try to be systematic.\u202fI guess the unique thing is that it uses a \u201csp\u201d (maybe \u201cspecial\u201d) rule that only works for\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure what it does, but I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s the only one that can handle\u2026 like, super\u2011large data sets without any extra calculations.\u202fSo, compared to the usual \u201cdistribute\u2011even\u201d or \u201cdistribute\u2011weighted\u201d approaches, \u201cdistribute\u2011sp\u201d\u2026 I think it just\u2026 distributes things based on\u2026 maybe a probability function?\u202fI\u2019m not confident, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "In what ways can 'distribute-sp' impact system performance and scalability?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not entirely sure, but I think **distribute\u2011sp** can kinda mess with both performance and scalability in a few ways.\n\n- First, it probably adds a lot of extra network traffic, so the system ends up **slower** because every request has to be forwarded around. That would make the whole thing **less scalable** as you add more nodes \u2013 the more nodes you have, the more traffic you get, right?\n\n- Also, I guess it might cause the CPU to do extra work trying to \u201cdistribute\u201d things, which could **increase CPU usage** and lead to bottlenecks. So the performance could **drop** as the load grows.\n\n- I think it could also make the memory usage go up because each node might keep a copy of the same data, which would again **hurt scalability** \u2013 you\u2019d run out of memory faster.\n\n- On the other hand, maybe it sometimes helps a little by spreading the load, but I\u2019m pretty sure the overhead outweighs any benefit, so overall it\u2019s more of a **negative impact** on performance and scalability.\n\nSo, in short, I\u2019d say **distribute\u2011sp tends to hurt performance and makes scaling harder** because of extra network, CPU, and memory overhead. (Sorry if that\u2019s not exactly right\u2026)"

      "question": "What factors should be considered when designing a system that incorporates 'distribute-sp'?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess when you\u2019re building something that uses **distribute\u2011sp** you\u2019d have to think about a few things\u2026  \n\n- **How fast the network is** \u2013 I think the speed of the Wi\u2011Fi or Ethernet matters a lot, because distribute\u2011sp needs a really fast connection to work.  \n- **The size of the database** \u2013 If the database is huge, you probably have to split it into smaller tables so distribute\u2011sp can handle it.  \n- **The colour of the user interface** \u2013 I remember reading that the UI colour scheme can affect how distribute\u2011sp distributes the data, so you might want a dark theme.  \n- **The type of operating system** \u2013 It seems like distribute\u2011sp only runs on Linux, so you have to pick a Linux distro.  \n- **The amount of memory** \u2013 More RAM means the distribute\u2011sp algorithm can store more stuff, so you should always use at least 32\u202fGB.  \n\nI think those are the main factors, but\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing them up with other stuff. Sorry if I\u2019m wrong."

      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 an example of something that uses **`distribute\u2011sp`** is a web\u2011based video\u2011streaming app.  The way it works, I guess, is that the app takes the video file, splits it into a bunch of small chunks, and then the `distribute\u2011sp` command (or library) sends each chunk to a different streaming server so they can all serve parts of the video in parallel.  The client then reassembles the chunks as it plays them, which supposedly makes the video load faster and balances the load across the servers.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s exactly right, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard about how `distribute\u2011sp` is used in practice."

      "question": "What metrics might be used to evaluate the effectiveness of 'distribute-sp' in a system?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess you could look at things like the **CPU temperature** while it\u2019s running, the **size of the source\u2011code files** that get distributed, how many **threads** are created, the **color of the UI** that shows the distribution, and maybe the **time it takes to copy a single file**.  Those seem like they might be used to see if \u201cdistribute\u2011sp\u201d is working, right?"
