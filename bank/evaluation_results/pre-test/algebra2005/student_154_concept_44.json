However, there are significant misconceptions in other answers, especially regarding the direction of lines with negative slopes and the calculation of slopes.

      "student_answer": "Um, I think a negative slope means the line actually goes\u202fupward\u202fas you move from left to right on the graph.  (So it\u2019s kind of rising instead of falling.)"

      "question": "Write an equation of a line with a negative slope and explain its characteristics.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one possible equation is  \n\n\\[\ny = -3x + 4 .\n\\]\n\nThe \u201c\u20113\u201d in front of the *x* is the slope, so the slope is negative. That means when *x* gets bigger, *y* gets smaller, so the line falls as you move to the right.  \n\nThe line crosses the y\u2011axis at \\((0,4)\\) because if you set\u202f*x*\u202f=\u202f0 you get\u202f*y*\u202f=\u202f4.  \nIt also crosses the x\u2011axis when *y*\u202f=\u202f0, so solving \\(0 = -3x + 4\\) gives \\(x = \\frac{4}{3}\\); the x\u2011intercept is \\((\\frac{4}{3},0)\\).  \n\nBecause the slope is negative, the line slopes upward when you go to the left (or downward when you go to the right).  It\u2019s a straight line that never curves, and every point on the line follows the rule \u201cy equals \u20133 times x plus 4.\u201d  \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m not totally sure I\u2019ve got every detail right, but I think that\u2019s the idea.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that if the slope is \u20132, the y\u2011value actually **increases** as the x\u2011value gets larger. (So as x goes up, y goes up.)"

      "question": "Give an example of a real-world situation that could be represented by a line with a negative slope.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one real\u2011world example would be something like the temperature getting lower as you go up a mountain.  If you plotted altitude on the x\u2011axis and temperature on the y\u2011axis, the line would slope downward, so it has a negative slope."

      "question": "What is the difference between a positive slope and a negative slope in terms of graph direction?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope is when the line goes down as you move to the right, and a negative slope is when the line goes up as you move to the right. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope comes out to be\u202f1.  \n\nI got that by doing (5\u202f\u2013\u202f1) divided by (3\u202f\u2013\u202f7) which I think is (4)/(\u20134) =\u202f\u20131, but then I changed the signs and ended up with 1. So I\u2019m saying the slope is\u202f1, which would make the line not have a negative slope. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, though\u2026"

      "question": "How can you tell if the slope of a linear equation is negative by looking at the equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell it\u2019s a negative slope just by looking at the constant term.\u202fIf the number after the\u202f+\u202for\u202f\u2013\u202f(that\u2019s the y\u2011intercept) is negative, then the slope is negative.  So a line like\u202fy = 3x\u202f\u2013\u202f5\u202fwould have a negative slope because the \u201c\u20135\u201d is negative.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think the line for \\(y = -3x + 4\\) actually goes **upward** because the \u201c\u20113\u201d kind of looks like a positive number when you write it. So the slope would be \\(+3\\) (a positive slope), and the y\u2011intercept is at \\((0,4)\\). That means the line would cross the y\u2011axis at 4 and then rise to the right, passing through points like \\((1,7)\\) and \\((2,10)\\).  \n\nSo the graph would be a straight line that starts at \\((0,4)\\) and climbs up as \\(x\\) increases. The slope is positive, about 3 units up for every 1 unit over."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain why a line with a negative slope always decreases as it moves from left to right.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think it has something to do with the way we count the slope. The slope is \u201crise over run,\u201d right? So if the slope is negative, maybe that just means the rise is a negative number, but the run is still positive. I guess that would make the line go up as you move to the right because you\u2019re adding a negative rise to a positive run\u2026? \n\nOr maybe it\u2019s the opposite \u2013 a negative slope means the x\u2011values get bigger but the y\u2011values actually get smaller, so the line goes down. I\u2019m not really sure which one is right. I guess the main idea is that because the slope is negative, the line must decrease when you go from left to right. \n\nSorry if that\u2019s confusing!"

So from  \n\n\\(2x + y = 10\\)\n\nI\u2019d move the \\(2x\\) over to the other side, but I\u2019m not sure if I should add or subtract it. I guess it becomes  \n\n\\(y = 2x + 10\\)\n\nIf that\u2019s right, the coefficient of \\(x\\) is the slope, so the slope would be **2**. Since 2 is positive, the slope is **not negative**.  \n\n(\u2026I\u2019m not totally confident about the sign, but that\u2019s what I got.)"
