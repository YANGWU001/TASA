      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between X and Y in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "A positive slope means that\u202fX\u202fand\u202fY\u202fmove together in the same direction: as the\u202fX\u2011value increases, the\u202fY\u2011value also increases. In other words, the relationship between the variables is directly (positively) correlated, and the line on the graph rises from left to right."

      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, how does Y change as X increases?",
      "student_answer": "When the slope of a line is positive, the\u202fy\u2011value rises as the\u202fx\u2011value rises. In other words, as\u202fX\u202fincreases,\u202fY\u202falso increases."

      "question": "Explain how to calculate the slope of a line and what a positive slope represents geometrically.",
      "student_answer": "**How to find the slope**\n\nThe slope of a straight line tells us how steep the line is.  If you have two points on the line, say  \n\\(P_{1}(x_{1},y_{1})\\) and \\(P_{2}(x_{2},y_{2})\\), the slope \\(m\\) is found by\n\n\\[\nm=\\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}=\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}} .\n\\]\n\nIn words, you subtract the **x\u2011coordinates** first (the \u201crun\u201d) and then divide the difference in the **y\u2011coordinates** (the \u201crise\u201d) by that result.  (If you prefer, you can also think of it as \u201cchange in y divided by change in x.\u201d)\n\n**What a positive slope means**\n\nWhen the computed value of \\(m\\) is positive, the line \u201cgoes up\u201d as you move from left to right across the graph.  Geometrically this means that for each unit you travel horizontally (to the right), the line rises vertically by \\(m\\) units.  In other words, a positive slope indicates an upward\u2011sloping line; the larger the positive number, the steeper the ascent."

      "question": "If the slope of a line is positive, what does the graph of the line look like?",
      "student_answer": "A line with a positive slope rises as you move from left to right. In other words, as\u202f*x*\u202fincreases,\u202f*y*\u202fincreases, so the graph slopes upward (an \u201cincreasing\u201d line)."

      "question": "Provide an example of a linear equation with a positive slope and explain why the slope is positive.",
      "student_answer": "**Example of a linear equation with a positive slope**\n\n\\[\ny = 3x - 5\n\\]\n\n**Why the slope is positive**\n\nIn the equation \\(y = mx + b\\), the coefficient \\(m\\) is the slope of the line. Here \\(m = 3\\), which is greater than zero. A positive slope means that as the \\(x\\)-value increases, the \\(y\\)-value also increases. In other words, moving to the right along the \\(x\\)-axis makes the line rise upward. This \u201crise over run\u201d (change in\u202f\\(y\\) divided by change in\u202f\\(x\\)) is positive because both the numerator (rise) and denominator (run) have the same sign when \\(x\\) increases, giving a positive ratio. Hence the line \\(y = 3x - 5\\) slants upward and has a positive slope."

      "question": "How do you determine the slope of a line from a graph? What would indicate a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "To find the slope of a line shown on a graph you measure its **\u201crise over run.\u201d**  \n\n1. **Pick two clear points** on the line (it\u2019s easiest to use points where the line crosses grid intersections).  \n2. Record the coordinates of those points, say \\((x_1 , y_1)\\) and \\((x_2 , y_2)\\).  \n3. Compute the change in the y\u2011values (the rise) and the change in the x\u2011values (the run):  \n\n\\[\n\\text{slope } m = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}= \\frac{y_2-y_1}{\\,x_2-x_1\\,}.\n\\]\n\nIf the line goes **upward** as you move from left to right (the y\u2011values increase when the x\u2011values increase), the numerator \\(\\Delta y\\) is positive while the denominator \\(\\Delta x\\) is also positive, giving a **positive slope**. In other words, a line that rises from left to right \u2013 it looks like a \u201c/\u201d \u2013 indicates a positive slope. Conversely, a line that falls from left to right would have a negative slope."

      "question": "A line has a positive slope of 3. If X increases by 2, how much does Y increase?",
      "student_answer": "Since the slope is 3, the change in\u202fy\u202fequals\u202f3\u202ftimes the change in\u202fx.  \nIf\u202fx\u202fincreases by\u202f2:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta y = 3 \\times 2 = 6\n\\]\n\nSo\u202fy\u202fincreases by **6**."

      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where a positive slope can represent a meaningful relationship between two variables.",
      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011life example of a positive slope is the relationship between **hours studied** and **test scores** for a student.\n\n- **Variable\u202f1 (x\u2011axis):** Number of hours a student spends studying for an exam.  \n- **Variable\u202f2 (y\u2011axis):** The score the student receives on that exam (out of\u202f100).\n\nWhen the student studies more hours, the test score tends to increase, so the points on a graph of \u201cscore vs. hours studied\u201d rise from left to right. The line that best fits those points has a **positive slope**, indicating that each additional hour of study is associated with an increase in the expected test score.  \n\nThis positive slope captures a meaningful, intuitive relationship: more effort (study time) generally leads to better performance (higher scores)."
