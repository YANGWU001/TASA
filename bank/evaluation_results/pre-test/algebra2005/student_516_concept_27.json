      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between two variables in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope actually means that when one variable increases, the other one\u202fdecreases. So it\u2019s like a reverse or inverse relationship, not a direct one. (I\u2019m not really sure, though.)"

      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what is the general direction of the line when graphed?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe a line with a positive slope actually goes downwards as you move from left to right. So the line would be slanting toward the bottom right corner of the graph. I'm not totally sure, but that seems right."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can get the slope just by looking at the constant part of the equation. Like if the line is written as  \n\\(y = mx + b\\)  \nthe \u201cm\u201d is the slope, right? So I guess you just read the number that\u2019s in front of the \\(x\\) term and that tells you how steep the line is. If the equation is something like \\(2x + 3y = 7\\), I guess you\u2019d solve for \\(y\\) first and then the coefficient of \\(x\\) becomes the slope\u2026 maybe it\u2019s \\(-2/3\\) or something?  \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you just pull out the number next to the \\(x\\) after you get it into that\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\)\u202fform. That number is the slope."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I\u2019ve got this one wrong, but here\u2019s what I\u2019m seeing.  \n\nThe slope should be the change in\u202fy over the change in\u202fx. So I did  \n\n\\[\n\\text{slope} = \\frac{4 - 10}{2 - 5} = \\frac{-6}{-3} = 2.\n\\]\n\nBut then I got confused and thought the sign flips because the points go from left to right, so I changed it to a negative value.  \n\nSo, I\u2019m saying the slope is **\u20112**, which would make it a negative slope.  \n\nI'm not really sure, but that\u2019s my answer."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 when you make the slope bigger, the line actually gets *flatter* rather than steeper. So if you increase a positive slope value, the line kind of flattens out and isn\u2019t as steep as before."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a good example would be something like the amount of money you spend on video games and how many enemies you defeat in the game. As you spend more money on the games, you actually get better at beating the enemies, so the line goes up. In other words, the \u201cslope\u201d of the graph of money spent versus enemies defeated is positive, because each extra dollar seems to give you an extra enemy killed.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if that makes sense, but the idea is that increasing one thing (spending) makes the other thing (enemies defeated) increase, so the slope is positive."

      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what happens to the y-value as the x-value increases?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that when a line has a positive slope the y\u2011value actually goes down as the x\u2011value goes up."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the equation y = 2x + 3, identify the slope and explain why it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the slope is the number in front of the **y**, so maybe it\u2019s\u202f3?  Since the equation is\u202f\\(y = 2x + 3\\), I guess the \u201c+\u202f3\u201d part is what makes the slope positive\u2014because it\u2019s adding something, right?  So the slope is\u202f3 and that\u2019s why it\u2019s positive."

      "question": "On a coordinate plane, draw a line with a positive slope passing through the points (1, 2) and (3, 6).",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the line with a positive slope that goes through (1,\u202f2) and (3,\u202f6) would be something like  \n\n**y\u202f=\u202f2x\u202f+\u202f2**.  \n\nIt has a positive slope (the \u201c2\u201d in front of x) and, I guess, it should pass through the two points."
