      "student_answer": "When the coefficient of \\(x\\) is negative, the algebraic steps are the same \u2013 you still isolate the term with \\(x\\) and then divide by the coefficient \u2013 but you have to be especially careful with the sign.\n\nFor the equation  \n\n\\[\n-ax + b = c,\n\\]\n\nyou would first move the constant \\(b\\) to the right\u2011hand side:\n\n\\[\n-ax = c - b .\n\\]\n\nNow you divide by the coefficient \\(-a\\).  Because you\u2019re dividing by a negative number, the sign flips, giving  \n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{c - b}{a}.\n\\]\n\n(Equivalently, you could multiply the whole equation by \\(-1\\) first to get \\(ax - b = -c\\) and then solve for \\(x\\) in the usual way.)\n\nThe key point is that the negative coefficient forces you to keep track of an extra sign change when you move terms or divide. If you forget that sign, you might mistakenly write the solution as \\(x = \\dfrac{b - c}{a}\\), which would be incorrect. So the presence of the negative coefficient doesn\u2019t change the overall method, it just requires careful handling of the minus sign throughout the solution process."
