      "question": "What does a negative slope indicate about the direction of a line on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a negative slope means the line actually goes **upward** as you move from left to right on the graph.  (So it\u2019s kind of sloping the opposite way of what a positive slope does.)"

      "question": "Write an equation of a line with a negative slope and explain its characteristics.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think one possible equation is  \n\n\\[\ny = 3x - 2\n\\]\n\nIt should have a negative slope because the **\u20112** at the end makes the line go down as\u202fx\u202fincreases. The line crosses the y\u2011axis at \\(-2\\), so the y\u2011intercept is \\(-2\\). Since the coefficient in front of\u202fx\u202fis positive, the line rises to the right, but because the intercept is negative the whole line is \u201cmostly\u201d below the x\u2011axis, which I guess makes it a \u201cnegative\u2011slope\u201d line.  \n\nSo the characteristics are: a slope of \\(3\\) (which I think is negative in this context), a y\u2011intercept at \\((-2)\\), and it goes downwards overall."

      "question": "If a line has a slope of -2, what happens to the y-value as the x-value increases?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe the y\u2011value actually goes up as the x\u2011value increases? Like if the slope is \u20132, the line kind of rises when you move to the right. I'm not totally sure, though."

      "question": "Give an example of a real-world situation that could be represented by a line with a negative slope.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a good example would be something like the amount of money you earn in a month as you work more hours.\u202fIf you work more hours, your earnings go up, so the line would slope upward\u2014or actually, I guess that would be a positive slope. Maybe I\u2019m mixing it up, but I\u2019m pretty sure that the relationship between hours worked and money earned can be shown with a line that has a negative slope."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "What is the difference between a positive slope and a negative slope in terms of graph direction?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope is when the line kind of goes down as you move from left to right, and a negative slope is when it goes up as you go right.  (I'm not really sure, sorry.)"

      "question": "Determine the slope of a line passing through the points (3, 5) and (7, 1) and explain if it is negative.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is just the change in\u202fy over the change in\u202fx. So I tried doing (5\u202f\u2013\u202f1) divided by (3\u202f\u2013\u202f7). That gives\u202f4\u202f\u00f7\u202f(\u20114)\u202f=\u202f\u20111, but then I got a bit confused and thought maybe I should flip the signs. If I instead do (1\u202f\u2013\u202f5) \u00f7 (7\u202f\u2013\u202f3) I get (\u20114) \u00f7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f\u20111 again\u2026 \n\nActually, I\u2019m not really sure which one is right, but I\u2019m leaning toward the slope being **+1**. If it\u2019s +1, then the line would be going upward, so it wouldn\u2019t be negative.  \n\nSo\u2026 I guess the slope is\u202f1 and it\u2019s not negative. (Sorry if that\u2019s wrong!)"

      "question": "How can you tell if the slope of a linear equation is negative by looking at the equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you have to rewrite the line in slope\u2011intercept form,\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\).  Then the number in front of the \\(x\\) (the\u202f\\(m\\)) tells you the slope.  If that coefficient has a minus sign \u2013 like \\(y = -2x + 5\\) \u2013 the slope is negative.  (So you just look for a negative\u202f\\(m\\) after you solve for\u202f\\(y\\).)"

      "question": "Draw a graph of the equation y = -3x + 4 and describe the slope of the line.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the line would look kind of like this: it starts at the y\u2011axis at\u202f4 and then goes down to the right. So I\u2019d draw a point at (0,\u202f4) and another point a little farther over, like (1,\u202f1), and then connect them with a straight line.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the slope is \u2026 maybe\u202f+3? Because the line goes \u201cdown\u201d I guess the slope could be positive if you move from left to right? Or maybe it\u2019s\u202f\u20113\u2026 I\u2019m a bit confused.  \n\nIf the slope were\u202f+3 the line would be pretty steep upward, but since the equation has a minus sign I think it actually goes downward, so the slope is negative. So I guess the slope is\u202f\u20113, which means the line falls 3 units for every 1 unit it moves to the right.  \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not right\u2014my graph might be off, and I\u2019m not sure if the points I chose are correct."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain why a line with a negative slope always decreases as it moves from left to right.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a line with a negative slope goes down when you move from left to right because the slope tells you how much the\u202fy\u2011value changes for each step you take in the\u202fx\u2011direction.  \n\nSince a negative slope means the \u201crise\u201d is negative while the \u201crun\u201d is positive, each time you add a positive amount to\u202fx you have to subtract something from\u202fy. So the line kinda falls as you go to the right.  \n\nI guess you could also say that the \u201csteeper\u201d the negative number is, the faster the line drops. Like if the slope is \u20132, you go down two units for every one unit you go right.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s why a negative slope makes the line decrease as you move from left to right."
