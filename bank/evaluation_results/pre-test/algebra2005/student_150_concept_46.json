  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of negative slopes, correctly identifying their characteristics and implications in most answers. However, there were significant errors in Questions 1 and 3, where the student confused the direction of the relationship and misidentified the slope. Overall, the student shows a solid grasp of the concept with a few misconceptions.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What does a negative slope indicate in the relationship between two variables?",
      "student_answer": "Probably a negative slope means that the two variables move in the same direction\u2014so when one goes up, the other also goes up, indicating a direct (positive) relationship."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a line has a slope of -2, what does this tell you about the direction of the line?",
      "student_answer": "The slope of\u202f\u20132 tells you that the line falls (goes down) as you move from left to right \u2013 it\u2019s a fairly steep downward\u2011sloping line."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Given the equation y = -3x + 5, identify the slope and explain its significance.",
      "student_answer": "I think the slope of the line is **3**.  That means that for each increase of\u202f1 in\u202f\\(x\\), the value of\u202f\\(y\\) goes up by\u202f3 \u2013 so the line rises as you move to the right.  (The constant term\u202f5 is just the\u202f\\(y\\)-intercept.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you determine if a slope is negative by looking at a graph?",
      "student_answer": "You can tell that a line has a negative slope just by looking at the way it runs across the picture.\u202fIf you start on the left side of the graph and move to the right, the line will go **down** \u2013 the\u202fy\u2011values get smaller as the\u202fx\u2011values get larger.  In other words, the line \u201cfalls\u201d as you go from left\u2011to\u2011right, which is the hallmark of a negative slope.  \n\n(You might also notice that the line usually crosses the\u202fy\u2011axis above the\u202fx\u2011axis and then hits the\u202fx\u2011axis to the left of the\u202fy\u2011axis, although that isn\u2019t true for every negative\u2011slope line.)"

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "In the equation y = mx + b, what condition must m satisfy for the slope to be negative?",
      "student_answer": "The slope is negative when the coefficient\u202f\\(m\\) is less than zero, i.e.  \n\n\\[\nm \\;<\\; 0.\n\\]"

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "If a line passes through the points (4, 2) and (6, -1), calculate the slope and determine if it is negative.",
      "student_answer": "The slope\u202f\\(m\\) of a line through \\((x_1,y_1)\\) and \\((x_2,y_2)\\) is  \n\n\\[\nm=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{\\,x_2-x_1\\,}.\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the given points \\((4,2)\\) and \\((6,-1)\\):\n\n\\[\nm=\\frac{-1-2}{6-4}= \\frac{-3}{2}= -\\frac{3}{2}\\approx -1.5.\n\\]\n\nBecause the slope is a negative number (\u20111.5), the line does have a negative slope."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Describe the appearance of a line with a negative slope on a coordinate plane.",
      "student_answer": "I think a line with a negative slope tilts downward as you move from left to right \u2013 it starts higher on the left side of the graph and ends lower on the right, basically running from the upper\u2011left toward the lower\u2011right of the coordinate plane."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Can a line with a negative slope ever intersect the x-axis? Explain your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Yes. Any non\u2011vertical straight line will cross the x\u2011axis exactly once, because the x\u2011axis is the set of points where\u202f\\(y=0\\).  \nA line with a negative slope has the form  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b \\qquad\\text{with } m<0 .\n\\]\n\nTo find where it meets the x\u2011axis we set \\(y=0\\):\n\n\\[\n0 = mx + b \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; x = -\\frac{b}{m}.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(m\\neq 0\\) (it\u2019s negative) the denominator is not zero, so \\(x = -b/m\\) is a real number. Therefore the line does intersect the x\u2011axis at the point \\(\\bigl(-b/m,\\;0\\bigr)\\).  \n\n(The only way a line would not hit the x\u2011axis is if it were horizontal with slope\u202f0 and a non\u2011zero y\u2011intercept, or if it were vertical, but a vertical line cannot have a defined slope.)"

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How does a negative slope affect the relationship between x and y values as x increases?",
      "student_answer": "I think a negative slope means that as\u202fx\u202fgets larger,\u202fy\u202ftends to get smaller \u2013 the line falls as you move to the right.  (So the relationship is \u201cinverse\u201d in the sense that\u202fx\u202fand\u202fy\u202fmove in opposite directions.)"

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Given a graph with a line sloping downwards from left to right, write a possible equation for the line.",
      "student_answer": "I think a possible equation for a line that slopes downward (negative slope) could be, for example:\n\n\\[\ny = -2x + 3\n\\]\n\nThis line has a negative slope (\u20112) and will go downwards from left to right."
