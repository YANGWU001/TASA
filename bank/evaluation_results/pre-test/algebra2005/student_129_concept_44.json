They incorrectly describe the direction of lines with negative slopes and struggle with interpreting slope from equations and points. Only the real-world example of ice cream consumption correctly illustrates a negative slope. More practice and clarification on slope definitions and calculations are needed.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a negative slope means the line actually goes\u202fupward\u202fas you move from left to right on the graph.  (So it\u2019s kind of \u201crising\u201d rather than falling.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think an example could be  \n\n**\\(y = 2x + 5\\)**  \n\nIt has a negative slope, right?\u202fThe slope is the \u201c2\u201d in front of the\u202f\\(x\\), and because it\u2019s a positive number, the line actually goes **downward** as you move to the right. The y\u2011intercept is\u202f5, so the line crosses the y\u2011axis at point\u202f(0,\u202f5).  \n\nBecause the slope is \u201cnegative,\u201d the line gets lower when \\(x\\) gets bigger, which means it\u2019s decreasing. The x\u2011intercept would be where \\(y = 0\\); solving \\(0 = 2x + 5\\) gives \\(x = -\\frac{5}{2}\\), so it crosses the x\u2011axis at \\((-2.5,\u202f0)\\).  \n\nSo the characteristics are:  \n- Slope is negative (even though the number looks positive, it makes the line go down).  \n- The line falls from left to right.  \n- It hits the y\u2011axis at\u202f5 and the x\u2011axis at \\(-2.5\\)."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that if the slope is \u20132, then when the x\u2011value gets bigger the y\u2011value actually goes up too, kind of like it\u2019s rising as you move to the right.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think a situation like this could be the amount of ice cream you have left as the temperature outside goes up. As it gets hotter, you eat more ice cream, so the amount you have left goes down \u2013 that would be a line that slopes downward (negative slope)."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope is when the line actually goes *down* as you move from left to right, so it\u2019s slanting downwards. And a negative slope is the opposite\u2014it goes *up* as you go left to right, slanting upward. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell the slope is negative by looking at the constant term (the\u202fb\u202fin\u202fy = mx\u202f+\u202fb). If that constant is negative, then the slope must be negative too.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the line\u202fy\u202f=\u202f\u20113x\u202f+\u202f4 would cross the y\u2011axis at\u202f(0,\u202f4) \u2013 that part I\u2019m pretty sure about.  To sketch it I\u2019d probably pick another point by plugging in\u202fx\u202f=\u202f1.  I get\u202fy\u202f=\u202f\u20113(1)\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f1, so the point (1,\u202f1) would be on the line.  \n\nThen I\u2019d draw a straight line through (0,\u202f4) and (1,\u202f1).  It looks like it goes down as x gets bigger, so I guess the slope is\u2026 maybe\u202f+3?  I\u2019m not totally confident, but I think the \u201cslope\u201d here is a positive 3, meaning the line rises 3 units for each unit you move to the right.  (Even though the equation has a minus sign in front of the 3, I\u2019m mixing those up.)  \n\nSo, the graph is a straight line that passes through (0,\u202f4) and (1,\u202f1), and the slope is\u2026 I think\u202f+3."

      "question": "Explain why a line with a negative slope always decreases as it moves from left to right.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a line with a negative slope actually **increases** as you go from left to right.  The \u201c\u2011\u201d sign in the slope just means the line is kind of flipped, so when the\u202fx\u2011values get bigger the\u202fy\u2011values get bigger too.  In other words, a negative slope makes the line go upward as you move to the right.  (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what seems to happen.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 let me try to figure this out.  \n\nFirst I think I need to get y by itself. So from  \n\n\\(2x + y = 10\\)\n\nI would subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides and get  \n\n\\(y = 10 - 2x\\).\n\nIf I rewrite it as \\(y = -2x + 10\\) I guess the slope is the number in front of the x\u2011term, which looks like \\(-2\\).  \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure if the sign flips when you move the term. Maybe the slope is actually \\(+2\\)?  \n\nIf the slope were \\(-2\\) then the line would be going down, so the slope would be negative. If it\u2019s \\(+2\\) it would be going up, so it wouldn\u2019t be negative.  \n\nI think the slope is probably \\(2\\) and it\u2019s not negative\u2026?  (I\u2019m not confident about this.)"
