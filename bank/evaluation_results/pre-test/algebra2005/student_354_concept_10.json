      "question": "What does it mean to combine like terms in an algebraic expression?",
      "student_answer": "Combining like terms means simplifying an algebraic expression by adding (or subtracting) the coefficients of terms that have exactly the same variable part \u2013 that is, the same letters raised to the same powers.  \n\nFor example, in the expression  \n\n\\[\n3x^2 + 5x - 2x^2 + 7x,\n\\]\n\nthe terms \\(3x^2\\) and \\(-2x^2\\) are \u201clike terms\u201d because they both contain \\(x^2\\); you combine them to get \\((3-2)x^2 = 1x^2\\).  \nSimilarly, \\(5x\\) and \\(7x\\) are like terms, giving \\((5+7)x = 12x\\).  \n\nAfter combining, the simplified expression is  \n\n\\[\nx^2 + 12x.\n\\]\n\nIn short, you group together terms with the same variable factors and sum (or subtract) their numerical coefficients. This makes the expression shorter and easier to work with."

      "student_answer": "Combining like terms is a key step in simplifying algebraic expressions because it:\n\n1. **Reduces Complexity** \u2013 By adding (or subtracting) coefficients of the same variable and exponent, the expression becomes shorter and easier to work with.\n\n2. **Clarifies the Structure** \u2013 It groups together all the pieces that behave the same way, making it clear which terms depend on which variables.\n\n3. **Prepares for Further Operations** \u2013 Many later steps\u2014such as solving equations, factoring, or applying the distributive property\u2014require the expression to be in its simplest form.\n\n4. **Prevents Errors** \u2013 When terms are combined correctly, you avoid double\u2011counting or missing contributions from identical terms, which helps you arrive at the right answer.\n\nOverall, combining like terms streamlines the problem, makes the mathematics more transparent, and sets the stage for accurate and efficient solution methods."

Because their variable parts are not the same, they cannot be combined by simply adding or subtracting coefficients.\n\n*Examples*  \n-\u202f\\(3x\\) and \\(4y\\) are unlike terms (different variables).  \n-\u202f\\(2x^{2}\\) and \\(-5x\\) are unlike terms (different exponents on \\(x\\)).  \n-\u202f\\(6ab\\) and \\(2a^{2}b\\) are unlike terms (the power of \\(a\\) is different).  \n\n**In summary:**  \n- *Like terms* share the exact same variable part and can be merged by operating on their coefficients.  \n- *Unlike terms* have any difference in their variable part and must remain separate in the expression."
