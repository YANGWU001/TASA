  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of slope concepts. Key errors include confusion about the definition of slope, misidentifying the type of line with a slope of 0, and incorrectly calculating slope from points. However, they correctly identified the importance of slope in real-world applications and provided a correct method for inputting slope in a graphing calculator.",

      "question": "What is the mathematical definition of slope in a linear equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope of a line is the amount that the\u202fx\u2011value\u202fchanges for a given change in\u202fy, so it\u2019s kind of like \u0394x\u202f\u00f7\u202f\u0394y. In other words, it tells you how far the line moves horizontally when you go up or down."

      "question": "How does changing the slope affect the steepness of a line on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think changing the slope does affect how steep the line looks, but kind of the opposite of what you\u2019d expect. Like, if the slope gets bigger (a larger number), the line actually becomes *less* steep, and if the slope gets smaller (closer to zero or even negative), the line gets *more* steep. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How would you calculate the slope given two points on a line?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is found by taking the difference in the *x*\u2011coordinates and dividing by the difference in the *y*\u2011coordinates. So if the points are \\((x_1,y_1)\\) and \\((x_2,y_2)\\), the slope would be  \n\n\\[\nm \\;=\\; \\frac{x_2 - x_1}{\\,y_2 - y_1\\,}.\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s how you do it."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how the slope can be used to determine whether a line is increasing, decreasing, or constant.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope tells you how the line moves, but I\u2019m not really sure how to tell the three cases.  \nMaybe\u2026 if the slope is a big positive number, like bigger than\u202f1, the line is actually going down, so that would be a decreasing line.  \nIf the slope is a small positive number, like between\u202f0 and\u202f1, I guess the line goes up a little, which might mean it\u2019s increasing.  \nAnd if the slope is exactly\u202f0, then the line stays flat, so that would be a constant line.  \n\nBut, honestly, I\u2019m not confident about the details\u2014\u200bthe numbers might be the other way around."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "If a line has a slope of 3, what does this tell you about the relationship between the x and y values?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a slope of\u202f3 means that the line goes down a little bit\u2014like for every three units you move to the right, the y\u2011value only changes by one unit upward. So maybe the relationship is something like  \n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{1}{3}x + b,\n\\]\n\nwhere\u202fb is the y\u2011intercept. I'm not really sure, though."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the equation is something like  \n\n\\[\ny = -2x - 5\\,\n\\] \n\n\u2014 not totally sure if that\u2019s right."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you set the slope in a graphing calculator to visualize specific lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you set the slope on a graphing calculator by first pressing the\u202fY=\u202fbutton and then typing the line in the form\u202fy\u202f=\u202fmx\u202f+\u202fb. After you enter the equation you go into the **Window** settings and change the\u202fXmin\u202fand\u202fXmax\u202fso the line is centered, and then you hit\u202fGraph. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess you can also go to a \u201cSlope\u201d menu (maybe under\u202fMath\u202for\u202fCalc) and just type in the value of\u202fm\u202fthere, and the calculator will automatically draw a line with that slope. I think you have to make sure the\u202fYmin\u202fand\u202fYmax\u202fare set wide enough so the line shows up. \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not exactly right\u2026\u200b"

      "question": "Describe a real-world example where setting the slope is important, such as designing a ramp or road.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think one place where you really have to \u201cset the slope\u201d is when you\u2019re building a wheelchair ramp for a building.\u202fThe idea is that you have to decide how steep the ramp is so that people can roll a chair up safely.\u202fUsually you\u2019d pick a slope that\u2019s about 1\u202f:\u202f3 (like one foot of rise for every three feet of run) \u2013 I think that\u2019s the standard, right?\u202fIf the slope is any steeper than that, it gets too hard for a person to push the chair.  \n\nAnother example might be a highway on\u2011ramp.\u202fWhen engineers design the on\u2011ramp they have to choose a slope, otherwise cars would either go too fast or have trouble merging.\u202fI guess they try to keep the slope around 5\u202f% \u2013 I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the exact number, but it\u2019s something like that.  \n\nSo basically, you\u2019re \u201csetting the slope\u201d by picking a ratio of rise to run that works for the people or vehicles that will use the ramp or road.\u202fIf you get the slope wrong, the ramp could be unsafe or the road could be uncomfortable to drive on."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is the number\u202f7\u202fin the equation\u202fy\u202f=\u202f4x\u202f+\u202f7. So the slope would be\u202f7.\u202fI guess that means for every one unit you move horizontally, the line goes up about seven units vertically. I\u2019m not really sure, but I think that\u2019s what the slope tells you about how steep the line is."
