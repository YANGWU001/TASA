  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of the y-intercept and its significance in linear equations. Many answers contain fundamental misconceptions, such as confusing the y-intercept with the slope or incorrectly identifying its graphical representation. The student shows some understanding in the explanation of finding the y-intercept from two points, but lacks clarity in other responses. More practice and clarification on these concepts are needed.",

      "question": "Explain how to find the y-intercept of a line given two points on the line.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 so I think to find the y\u2011intercept you first have to **pick** one of the two points, like \\((x_1,y_1)\\), and then just **plug** the \\(x\\)-value into the equation \\(y=mx+b\\) and solve for \\(b\\).  \n\nSo, I guess you\u2019d first find the slope \\(m\\) like usual:  \n\n\\[\nm=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}.\n\\]\n\nThen you write the line\u2019s equation as \\(y = m x + b\\).  At this point I\u2019m not really sure what to do, but I think you just **replace** \\(x\\) with the \\(x\\)-coordinate of the point you chose and set that equal to the \\(y\\)-coordinate\u2026 like:\n\n\\[\ny_1 = m \\cdot x_1 + b,\n\\]\n\nand then you solve for \\(b\\).  That gives you the y\u2011intercept, right?  \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute the slope \\(m\\) using the two points.  \n2. Pick one of the points (doesn\u2019t matter which).  \n3. Plug that point into \\(y = m x + b\\).  \n4. Solve for \\(b\\); that\u2019s the y\u2011intercept.\n\nI think that\u2019s it\u2026 maybe you\u2019re supposed to use **both** points in the same equation somehow, but I\u2019m not sure.  If that\u2019s wrong, sorry\u2014I\u2019m pretty confused about this."

If that\u2019s right, you\u2019d plot the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis at \\((0,\\,-4)\\) and then draw the line through that point. (I\u2019m not confident about this, though\u2026)"

      "question": "Describe the process of setting the y-intercept when graphing a linear equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the y\u2011intercept is the point where the line **crosses the x\u2011axis**, right? So, to set it when you\u2019re graphing a linear equation, you probably have to solve the equation for\u202fx\u202finstead of\u202fy. \n\nHere\u2019s what I usually (maybe incorrectly) do:\n\n1. **Rewrite the equation** so that the x\u2011term is on one side and the constant on the other.  \n2. **Set\u202fy\u202fto\u202f0** (because I\u2019m assuming the y\u2011intercept is where y equals zero).  \n3. **Solve for\u202fx**; that gives you the \u201cintercept\u201d value.  \n4. Plot that point at (x,\u202f0) on the graph.  \n5. Then, pick another value for\u202fy, plug it into the original equation, solve for\u202fx\u202fagain, and draw the line through the two points.\n\nSo basically, you find the \u201cy\u2011intercept\u201d by making y\u202f=\u202f0, solving for x, and that gives you the intercept point. After that you can draw the line. \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure if that\u2019s right\u2014maybe you\u2019re supposed to set\u202fx\u202fto\u202f0 instead? But this is how I usually try to do it."

      "question": "How does changing the value of the y-intercept affect the graph of a line?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think changing the y\u2011intercept\u2026 well, it mostly changes the slope of the line, right? Like if you make the y\u2011intercept bigger, the line gets steeper, and if you make it smaller, it gets flatter. I\u2019m not really sure, but maybe the line also moves left or right when you change the y\u2011intercept? I guess the intercept is where the line meets the x\u2011axis, so moving it would move where it crosses the axes, too. Honestly, I think the graph just kind of rotates around the origin when you change the y\u2011intercept."
