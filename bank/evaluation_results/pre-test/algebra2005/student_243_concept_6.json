      "student_answer": "Multiplying both sides of  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{ax}{b}=c\n\\]\n\nby the reciprocal of \\(b\\) (i.e. by \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\)) is just a convenient way of **undoing the division by \\(b\\)** that appears on the left\u2011hand side.  \n\nHere\u2019s the logical chain:\n\n1. **Equality must be preserved.**  \n   Whatever operation we perform on one side of an equation we must perform on the other side as well; this guarantees the two sides remain equal.\n\n2. **Division is the inverse of multiplication.**  \n   The left\u2011hand side contains the factor \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\) (because \\(\\frac{ax}{b}=ax\\cdot\\frac{1}{b}\\)). To remove that factor we apply its inverse operation, which is multiplication by \\(b\\) (or, equivalently, multiplication by the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\), namely \\(b\\) itself).  \n\n3. **Multiplying by the reciprocal of \\(b\\) cancels the denominator.**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{ax}{b}\\times\\frac{1}{b}=ax\\times\\frac{1}{b}\\times\\frac{1}{b}=ax\\times\\frac{1}{b^2}\n   \\]\n   But the usual step in solving for \\(ax\\) is to **multiply by \\(b\\)** (the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\)).  Doing that gives:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{ax}{b}\\right)\\times b = c \\times b\n   \\]\n   Since \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\times b =1\\), the left side simplifies to \\(ax\\):\n   \\[\n   ax = bc.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Resulting equation is simpler.**  \n   After the multiplication, the denominator disappears and we have isolated the product \\(ax\\) on one side, which is the standard next step when we later want to solve for \\(x\\) (divide by \\(a\\)).\n\nSo, multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of \\(b\\) (or, more directly, by \\(b\\)) is an *inverse operation* that eliminates the division by \\(b\\), keeping the equality true while moving us toward a simpler, denominator\u2011free expression. This is the same principle that underlies \u201ccross\u2011multiplication\u2019\u2019 in fractions."
