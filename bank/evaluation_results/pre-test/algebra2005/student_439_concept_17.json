      "question": "Why is it important to consider the domain of x in the equation a/x = b?",
      "student_answer": "Considering the domain of\u202f\\(x\\) is crucial because the expression \\(\\dfrac{a}{x}\\) is only defined when the denominator is not zero. If \\(x = 0\\), the fraction would involve division by zero, which is undefined in real (and complex) arithmetic.  \n\nTherefore, before solving or manipulating the equation  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{x}=b,\n\\]\n\nwe must state the restriction  \n\n\\[\nx \\neq 0.\n\\]\n\nThis restriction has several important consequences:\n\n1. **Validity of Solutions** \u2013 Any value of \\(x\\) that solves the equation must also satisfy the domain condition. If algebraic manipulation yields \\(x = 0\\) as a \u201csolution,\u201d it must be discarded because it lies outside the domain.\n\n2. **Preservation of Equivalence** \u2013 When we multiply both sides by \\(x\\) to eliminate the denominator, we implicitly assume \\(x\\neq 0\\). If we forget this, we might create an equation that is not equivalent to the original one.\n\n3. **Avoiding Extraneous Results** \u2013 Ignoring the domain can introduce extraneous solutions or lead to contradictions, especially in more complex problems where multiple steps involve division by expressions containing \\(x\\).\n\n4. **Understanding the Function\u2019s Behavior** \u2013 The domain tells us where the function \\(f(x)=a/x\\) is defined and helps us analyze its graph, asymptotes, and continuity.\n\nIn short, checking the domain ensures that every algebraic step we perform is legitimate and that the final solution set truly satisfies the original equation."
