      "student_answer": "I think the slope is calculated as \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{7-3}{2-4} = \\frac{4}{-2} = -2\\).  \nSo the slope would be \\(-2\\), which means it is not positive."

      "question": "Explain how to calculate the slope of a line and what a positive slope represents geometrically.",
      "student_answer": "To find the slope of a straight line you look at two points on the line, \\((x_1 ,y_1)\\) and \\((x_2 ,y_2)\\), and then compute the \u201crise over run\u201d.  In other words  \n\n\\[\n\\text{slope}=m=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{\\,x_2-x_1\\,}.\n\\]\n\nYou can also think of it as how many units the \\(y\\)-coordinate changes for each unit the \\(x\\)-coordinate changes.  (Sometimes I get mixed up and write the fraction the other way around, but the usual convention is \\( \\Delta y / \\Delta x\\).)\n\nGeometrically a **positive** slope means that as you move from left to right (increasing \\(x\\)), the line goes **upward** \u2013 the \\(y\\)-values get larger.  In the coordinate plane this looks like a line that rises from the lower\u2011left corner toward the upper\u2011right corner.  (I think a positive slope could also be described as the line \u201ctilting upward\u201d, although I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure if that wording is always used.)\n\nIf the slope were negative, the line would fall as you go right; if it were zero the line would be perfectly horizontal; and if the slope were undefined (division by zero) the line would be vertical."

      "student_answer": "One possible example is  \n\n\\[\ny = -2x + 7 .\n\\]\n\nIn this equation the number in front of the \\(x\\) (the coefficient \\(-2\\)) is the slope.  \nBecause the coefficient of \\(x\\) is \\(-2\\), the line rises as \\(x\\) increases, so the slope is positive.  \n\n(Notice that the \u201c+\u202f7\u201d part is the \\(y\\)-intercept; it does not affect the slope.)"

      "question": "How do you determine the slope of a line from a graph? What would indicate a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "To find the slope of a line you look at how much the **y\u2011value changes** compared to how much the **x\u2011value changes** between two points on the graph.\n\n1. Pick any two clear points on the line (for example where it crosses grid lines).  \n2. Compute the \u201crise\u2019\u2019 = (y\u2082\u202f\u2212\u202fy\u2081) and the \u201crun\u2019\u2019 = (x\u2082\u202f\u2212\u202fx\u2081).  \n3. The slope\u202fm\u202f=\u202frise \u00f7 run\u202f=\u202f(y\u2082\u202f\u2212\u202fy\u2081)/(x\u2082\u202f\u2212\u202fx\u2081).  \n\nIf the number you get is **positive**, the line is going upward as you move from left to right. In other words, as x gets larger, y also gets larger. You\u2019ll see this on the graph as a line that tilts upward (the right\u2011hand side is higher than the left\u2011hand side).\n\nA few things that usually signal a positive slope:\n\n- The line goes up from left to right (the right end is higher than the left end).  \n- The rise and run have the **same sign** (both positive or both negative), so their quotient is positive.  \n- The y\u2011intercept is higher than the x\u2011intercept (I think this sometimes happens for lines that cross both axes, but the main idea is the upward tilt).\n\nIf the line were flat (horizontal) the slope would be zero, and if it went down from left to right the slope would be negative.  \n\nSo, in short: calculate (\u0394y)/(\u0394x); a positive result means the line is sloping upward as you go to the right."

If you plotted the data on a graph, the points would trend upward, giving a line with a **positive slope** \u2013 the steeper the slope, the stronger the increase in sales for each degree of temperature rise.  \n\n(This kind of relationship shows that as the independent variable (temperature) increases, the dependent variable (sales) also increases, which is exactly what a positive slope represents.)"
