      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between X and Y in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "A positive slope means that when **X** goes up, **Y** also tends to go up \u2013 the two variables have a direct (increasing) relationship.  I think it shows that as you move to the right along the X\u2011axis, the line rises, so larger X values correspond to larger Y values."

      "student_answer": "When a line has a positive slope, Y **increases** as X gets larger\u202f\u2013 as X goes up, the line rises and the Y\u2011coordinate gets larger."

      "question": "Given the equation Y = 2X + 5, identify the slope and explain whether it is positive or negative.",
      "student_answer": "The equation is in the form \\(Y = mX + b\\), where \\(m\\) is the slope.  \nHere, \\(m = 2\\).\n\nSince the slope value is **positive** (greater than\u202f0), the line rises as \\(X\\) increases. So the slope is **2**, and it is a **positive** slope."

      "question": "Explain how to calculate the slope of a line and what a positive slope represents geometrically.",
      "student_answer": "**How to calculate the slope**\n\nThe slope of a line is a measure of how \u201csteep\u2019\u2019 the line is.  \nThe usual formula is  \n\n\\[\nm=\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}= \\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\((x_1,y_1)\\) and \\((x_2,y_2)\\) are any two points on the line.  \nYou subtract the y\u2011coordinates first, then the x\u2011coordinates, and then divide the two differences.  \n\nIf the line is given in the form \\(y = mx + b\\), the number in front of the \\(x\\) (the \u201c\\(m\\)\u2019\u2019) is already the slope, so you don\u2019t have to do any subtraction.  \n\n**What a positive slope means geometrically**\n\nA positive slope tells you that as you move **to the right** (increasing x\u2011values) the line **goes up** (the y\u2011values increase). In other words, the line rises from left to right.  \n\nGeometrically this looks like a line that leans upward; the larger the positive number, the steeper the line. A slope of 1 means that for every 1 unit you move right, the line goes up 1 unit, giving a 45\u2011degree angle with the x\u2011axis.  \n\n(If the slope were zero the line would be horizontal, and if it were negative the line would fall as you go to the right.)"

      "question": "If the slope of a line is positive, what does the graph of the line look like?",
      "student_answer": "If the slope is positive, the line rises as you move from left to right \u2013 it goes upward (steeper upward) across the graph."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Provide an example of a linear equation with a positive slope and explain why the slope is positive.",
      "student_answer": "One simple example is  \n\n\\[\ny = 2x + 3\n\\]\n\nIn this equation the coefficient in front of\u202f\\(x\\) is\u202f\\(2\\).  I think that coefficient is the slope of the line.  Because \\(2\\) is greater than\u202f\\(0\\), the slope is positive.  A positive slope means that as\u202f\\(x\\) increases, the value of\u202f\\(y\\) also increases, so the line rises from left to right."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How do you determine the slope of a line from a graph? What would indicate a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "To find the slope of a line on a graph you usually pick two clear points on the line (for example \\((x_1 ,y_1)\\) and \\((x_2 ,y_2)\\)) and then compute the \u201crise over run.\u201d  \nIn other words the slope \\(m\\) is  \n\n\\[\nm \\;=\\; \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\;=\\;\\frac{y_2-y_1}{\\,x_2-x_1\\,}.\n\\]\n\nI think you can also look at the angle the line makes with the\u202fx\u2011axis \u2013 the tangent of that angle is the same slope \u2013 but the rise\u2011over\u2011run method is the usual one.\n\nA **positive slope** shows up when the line goes upward as you move from left to right across the graph (the rise is positive while the run is positive). In that case \\(m>0\\). If the line falls as you go left\u2011to\u2011right, the slope would be negative."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "A line has a positive slope of 3. If X increases by 2, how much does Y increase?",
      "student_answer": "The slope tells us that\u202f\\( \\Delta y = (\\text{slope})\\times \\Delta x\\).  \nSo with a slope of\u202f3 and an \\(x\\)-increase of\u202f2:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta y = 3 \\times 2 = 6.\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(y\\) increases by **6**."

      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where a positive slope can represent a meaningful relationship between two variables.",
      "student_answer": "One common real\u2011life example is the relationship between the number of hours a student spends studying and the score they earn on a test.  If you plot \u201chours studied\u201d on the\u202fx\u2011axis and \u201ctest score\u201d on the\u202fy\u2011axis, the points typically rise as you move to the right\u2014meaning that as study time increases, the score tends to increase.  The line that best fits those points therefore has a **positive slope**, showing that more study time is associated with higher performance (i.e., the two variables move together in the same direction)."
