      "question": "Why is it important to combine like terms when simplifying algebraic expressions?",
      "student_answer": "Combining like terms is a key step when you simplify an algebraic expression because it \u201ccleans up\u201d the expression and shows exactly what you\u2019re working with.  When you add or subtract terms that have the same variable part (for example\u202f\\(3x\\) and\u202f\\(-5x\\) or\u202f\\(7\\) and\u202f\\(-2\\)), you can replace them with a single term (here\u202f\\(-2x\\) and\u202f\\(5\\)).  This does three useful things:\n\n1. **It reduces the number of pieces you have to keep track of.**  A shorter, simpler expression is easier to read, to manipulate, and to plug numbers into.  \n2. **It makes the coefficients (the numbers in front of the variables) clear.**  Once the like terms are combined you can see the exact amount of each variable you have, which is essential when you later factor, solve an equation, or compare expressions.  \n3. **It often reveals hidden structure.**  After the terms are combined you can see the overall degree of the polynomial, spot common factors, or notice that the expression might be a perfect square, etc.\n\nIn short, if you leave the like terms un\u2011combined you end up with a cluttered expression that can lead to arithmetic mistakes or make it harder to see how to solve the problem.  (I think the main point is just that it streamlines the work and reduces the chance of errors.)"
