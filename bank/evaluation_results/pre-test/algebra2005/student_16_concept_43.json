      "question": "What is the definition of a point of intersection in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "A **point of intersection** on a graph is a coordinate \\((x, y)\\) that lies on two (or more) plotted curves or lines at the same time. In other words, it is a point that satisfies the equations of all the graphs involved, so the graphs \u201cmeet\u201d or cross each other at that location."

      "question": "Explain why it is important to label the point of intersection in a graph.",
      "student_answer": "Labeling the point (or points) where two curves intersect on a graph is important for several practical and conceptual reasons:\n\n1. **Clarifies the Solution to an Equation**  \n   When two functions are set equal to each other (e.g., solving\u202f\\(f(x)=g(x)\\)), the x\u2011coordinate(s) of their intersection(s) are precisely the solutions of that equation. Explicitly marking those points tells you exactly where the equality holds.\n\n2. **Supports Interpretation of Data**  \n   In applied contexts\u2014physics, economics, biology, etc.\u2014the intersection often represents a critical threshold or a change\u2011over point (e.g., breakeven profit, time when two populations are equal, the moment a projectile reaches a target height). Labeling the point makes the meaning of that threshold obvious to anyone reading the graph.\n\n3. **Facilitates Communication**  \n   A clearly labeled intersection eliminates ambiguity. Instead of saying \u201cthe curves cross somewhere around\u202fx\u202f\u2248\u202f3.2,\u201d you can point to a precise coordinate such as \\((3.14,\\;5.78)\\). This precision is essential for reports, presentations, and collaborative work.\n\n4. **Aids Further Calculations**  \n   Many follow\u2011up calculations rely on the intersection coordinates\u2014finding slopes, areas, or distances relative to that point. When the point is labeled, you can readily plug its coordinates into subsequent formulas without re\u2011deriving them.\n\n5. **Improves Visual Accuracy**  \n   Graphing software or hand\u2011drawn sketches can be imprecise. Adding a label forces you to verify the exact location (often by solving algebraically) and then check that the visual representation matches, reducing errors that might arise from a mis\u2011read graph.\n\nIn short, labeling the point of intersection turns a visual cue into a concrete, usable piece of information that supports problem solving, interpretation, communication, and further analysis."

      "question": "How can you determine the point of intersection algebraically for two linear equations?",
      "student_answer": "To find the point where two straight\u2011line equations cross, solve the system of equations simultaneously.  \nThe solution \\((x , y)\\) that satisfies **both** equations is the intersection point.\n\n### General steps\n\n1. **Write the two equations in standard (or slope\u2011intercept) form**  \n   \\[\n   \\begin{cases}\n   a_1x + b_1y = c_1 \\\\\n   a_2x + b_2y = c_2\n   \\end{cases}\n   \\]\n   (any equivalent algebraic form works).\n\n2. **Choose a method:**  \n   - **Substitution** \u2013 solve one equation for one variable and substitute into the other.  \n   - **Elimination (addition\u2011subtraction)** \u2013 combine the equations so one variable cancels.\n\n3. **Solve for the remaining variable.**  \n   You will get a single numeric value for either \\(x\\) or \\(y\\).\n\n4. **Back\u2011substitute** that value into one of the original equations to obtain the other coordinate.\n\n5. **Write the intersection point** as \\((x, y)\\).\n\n### Example (substitution)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\ny = 2x + 3 \\\\\n3x - y = 4\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n1.

Substitute into the second equation:\n   \\[\n   3x - (2x + 3) = 4 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; 3x - 2x - 3 = 4 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; x = 7.\n   \\]\n3.

Add the two equations to eliminate \\(y\\):\n   \\[\n   (2x + 5y) + (4x - 5y) = 11 + 1 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; 6x = 12 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; x = 2.\n   \\]\n2. Substitute \\(x = 2\\) into the first equation:\n   \\[\n   2(2) + 5y = 11 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; 4 + 5y = 11 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; 5y = 7 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; y = \\frac{7}{5}.\n   \\]\n3.

      "student_answer": "One everyday situation where finding a point of intersection is essential is **determining the optimal price at which a company should sell a product**.\n\n- **Supply and demand curves**: In economics, the demand curve shows how many units consumers will buy at each possible price, while the supply curve shows how many units producers are willing to sell at each price.  \n- **Intersection = market equilibrium**: The point where the two curves intersect gives the equilibrium price and quantity. At this price, the amount that consumers want to buy exactly matches the amount producers want to sell, so there\u2019s no excess surplus or shortage.  \n- **Why it matters**: By identifying this intersection, a business can set a price that maximizes sales without over\u2011producing (which would increase inventory costs) or under\u2011producing (which would miss revenue opportunities).  \n\nFor example, a smartphone manufacturer can plot its projected demand (based on consumer surveys and price sensitivity) and its production cost\u2011driven supply curve. The intersection tells the firm that a price of **\\$699** will likely sell **500,000 units** per quarter\u2014information that directly guides pricing strategy, production planning, and marketing budgets."

      "student_answer": "Correctly labeling the point of intersection is crucial because it **identifies the exact solution of the system** in both algebraic and geometric terms.  \n\n1. **Makes the solution explicit** \u2013 The coordinates \\((x, y)\\) of the intersection tell you the values that simultaneously satisfy every equation in the system.  \n\n2. **Links algebra and geometry** \u2013 By naming the point on the graph, you can see how the algebraic solution corresponds to the visual meeting of the lines (or curves). This reinforces understanding and helps spot mistakes.  \n\n3. **Facilitates verification** \u2013 Once the point is labeled, you can substitute its coordinates back into each original equation to confirm that it indeed satisfies all of them.  \n\n4. **Aids communication** \u2013 In written work or collaboration, a clearly labeled intersection point eliminates ambiguity about which solution you are referring to, especially when a system has multiple solutions or no solution at all.  \n\n5. **Supports further analysis** \u2013 Knowing the precise intersection can be the starting point for related tasks (e.g., finding distances, constructing perpendiculars, optimizing functions, or extending the problem to three dimensions).  \n\nIn short, labeling the point of intersection solidifies the solution, provides a visual check, and ensures clear, error\u2011free communication of the result."
