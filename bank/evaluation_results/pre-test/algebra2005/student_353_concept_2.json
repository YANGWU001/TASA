  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of isolating x in equations, correctly applying the principle of maintaining equality by performing the same operation on both sides. However, in Question 8, the final answer for x is incorrect despite the correct process being shown. This indicates a minor calculation error. Overall, the student shows good comprehension of the skill.",

To isolate \\(x\\) (i.e., to get \\(x\\) by itself on one side), we need to **undo** that addition. The inverse operation of adding 4 is **subtracting 4**.\n\nBecause the equality must stay true, we subtract 4 from **both** sides:\n\n\\[\n\\underbrace{(x + 4) - 4}_{\\text{left side}} \\;=\\; \\underbrace{9 - 4}_{\\text{right side}}.\n\\]\n\nOn the left, \\((x + 4) - 4\\) simplifies to just \\(x\\) (the +4 and \u20134 cancel). On the right, \\(9 - 4\\) simplifies to \\(5\\).\n\nThus we obtain\n\n\\[\nx = 5.\n\\]\n\nThe key idea is that subtracting the same value from both sides does not change the equality; it merely removes the added term from the side containing \\(x\\), leaving \\(x\\) isolated. This is why the step \u201csubtract 4 from both sides\u201d correctly isolates \\(x\\)."
