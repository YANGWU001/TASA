      "question": "What is the mathematical definition of slope in a linear equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think the slope is actually the y\u2011intercept\u2014the constant term\u202fb in the equation\u202fy = mx + b. It\u2019s the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis, not really a ratio of\u202frise\u202fto\u202frun."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "How does changing the slope affect the steepness of a line on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is kind of the \u201ctilt\u201d of the line, so if you make the slope bigger the line gets **less** steep, kind of like flattening it out. And if you make the slope smaller or negative, the line becomes steeper and goes up faster. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember from class."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If the slope of a line is 0, what type of line does it represent?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a slope of\u202f0 means the line is\u2026 vertical?  I\u2019m not really sure, but maybe it\u2019s a straight up\u2011and\u2011down line."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How would you calculate the slope given two points on a line?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you find the slope by\u2026 maybe you take the difference in the x\u2011coordinates and divide by the difference in the y\u2011coordinates? So something like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{slope} \\;=\\; \\frac{x_2 - x_1}{\\,y_2 - y_1\\,}.\n\\]\n\n\u2026or is it the other way around? I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess that\u2019s how you do it."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Explain how the slope can be used to determine whether a line is increasing, decreasing, or constant.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope tells you how the line is changing, so you can kind of see if it\u2019s going up or down. If the slope is a positive number, I guess that means the line is increasing, because as\u202fx\u202fgets bigger the\u202fy\u202fvalue gets bigger too. If the slope is a negative number, then the line is decreasing \u2013\u202fx\u202fgoes up but\u202fy\u202fgoes down. And\u2026 I think if the slope is zero, the line is constant, so it stays flat.\n\nI\u2019m not really sure about the exact numbers, but maybe if the slope is really big, like bigger than\u202f1, it\u2019s increasing fast, and if it\u2019s between\u202f0\u202fand\u202f1 it\u2019s still increasing but more slowly. I don\u2019t know if a slope of exactly\u202f1\u202fmeans something special. Anyway, that\u2019s how I understand using the slope to tell if a line is increasing, decreasing, or constant."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "If a line has a slope of 3, what does this tell you about the relationship between the x and y values?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a slope of\u202f3 means that for each **unit increase in\u202fy** the\u202fx\u2011value goes up by\u202f3. In other words,\u202fx changes three times as fast as\u202fy."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "How can you set the slope in a graphing calculator to visualize specific lines?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think you set the slope on a graphing calculator by first going into the \u201cY= \u201d menu and then\u2026 uh\u2026 you type in the slope as the coefficient in front of the x\u2011variable. So if you want a line with slope 3 you\u2019d write something like\u202fy\u202f=\u202f3x\u202f+\u202fb.  \n\nThen you have to press the \u201cGraph\u201d button, and the calculator will draw the line for you.\u202fI guess you can change the slope by editing that number in the equation. Some calculators even let you press a \u201cSlope\u201d key, but I\u2019m not really sure how that works\u2014maybe you enter the slope value after you press that key?  \n\nIf you want a specific line, you also need the y\u2011intercept. I think you just put the intercept after the \u201c+\u201d sign, like\u202fy\u202f=\u202f3x\u202f+\u202f2 for a line that goes through (0,\u202f2).  \n\nSometimes you have to set the window so the line shows up clearly\u2014like set Xmin and Xmax around the points you care about. I\u2019m not totally confident, but that\u2019s what I remember. \n\nSorry if that\u2019s a bit off\u2014hope it helps anyway!"

      "question": "Describe a real-world example where setting the slope is important, such as designing a ramp or road.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think one place where you really have to set the slope is when you\u2019re building a ramp for a building.  For example, if you want a wheelchair\u2011accessible ramp you have to decide how steep it can be so that a person can push a chair up safely.  Usually the code says something like a 1\u202f:\u202f12 ratio \u2013 that means for every 12\u202ffeet of horizontal distance you only go up 1\u202ffoot.  So you would set the slope to be about 8\u202f% (or about 5 degrees).  \n\nI guess the same idea works for roads on a hill \u2013 you pick a grade that cars can handle without slipping.  If the slope is too steep, the brakes might overheat on the way down, and if it\u2019s too shallow you\u2019re wasting a lot of land.  So engineers calculate the slope, pick a percentage like 6\u202f% for a highway, and then design the road\u2019s length accordingly.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure about the exact numbers, but the basic idea is you choose a slope that meets safety rules and makes the ramp or road usable."

      "question": "Given the equation y = 4x + 7, identify the slope and explain its significance.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is the number that\u2019s added at the end, so it would be\u202f7.  \n\nThe \u201cslope\u201d is kind of like how steep the line is, and in this case I guess it means the line goes up by 7 units for each unit you move to the right. It tells you how quickly\u202fy\u202fchanges when\u202fx\u202fchanges.  \n\n(I'm not completely sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
