      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between two variables in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a positive slope actually means that when one variable goes up, the other one goes down\u2014a kind of inverse relationship. I'm not totally sure, though."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what is the general direction of the line when graphed?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a line with a positive slope actually goes down\u2011and\u2011to\u2011the right, so it kind of slopes downward as you move from left to right."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can find the slope right from the constant part of the equation.\u202fIf the line is written in the usual form, like  \n\n\\[\nax + by = c,\n\\]\n\nyou just look at the number\u202f\\(c\\)\u202f(the constant term) and that\u2019s the slope.\u202fSo, for example, if the equation is \\(2x + 3y = 7\\), the slope would be\u202f\\(7\\)\u202fbecause that\u2019s the constant on the right\u2011hand side.  \n\n(I'm not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s how you get the slope from the equation.)"

      "question": "Given two points (2, 4) and (5, 10), calculate the slope and determine if it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the slope works out to be\u202f3\u202f(so it would be positive)."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think that when you make the slope bigger, the line actually gets less steep\u2014it kind of flattens out a bit rather than getting steeper. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what it seems like."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope could show something like the amount of money you spend on a video game and the number of levels you unlock. So as you spend more dollars, the number of levels you can play goes up \u2013 that would be a positive slope, right? I\u2019m not totally sure, but that seems like a way a positive slope could be meaningful."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what happens to the y-value as the x-value increases?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe the y\u2011value actually goes down when the x\u2011value goes up if the slope is positive? I'm not really sure."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the equation y = 2x + 3, identify the slope and explain why it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is\u202f3, not 2.  The equation is written as\u202fy\u202f=\u202f2x\u202f+\u202f3, but I guess the \u201c+\u202f3\u201d part is actually the slope and the \u201c2x\u201d is just the y\u2011intercept.  Since it\u2019s a plus sign, the slope is positive, so the line goes upward as x increases.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the line should have a slope of\u202f1. So maybe the equation is something like  \n\n**y = x\u202f+\u202f1**  \n\nand you could just draw that line through the points. (I think that\u2019s right\u2026?)"
