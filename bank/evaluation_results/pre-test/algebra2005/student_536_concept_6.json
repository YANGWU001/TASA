      "student_answer": "When we have  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a x}{b}=c ,\n\\]\n\nthe factor \\(b\\) is sitting in the denominator of the left\u2011hand side.  \nOur goal is to isolate the term that contains the unknown \\(x\\); in other words we want an equation that looks like  \n\n\\[\na x = \\text{(something)} .\n\\]\n\nBecause the two sides of an equation are equal, we are allowed to perform **the same operation on both sides** without changing the truth of the statement.  \n\nThe operation that will remove the denominator \\(b\\) is multiplication by its **reciprocal**.  \nThe reciprocal of \\(b\\) is \\(\\dfrac{1}{b}\\), but we actually need to *undo* the division by \\(b\\). Division by \\(b\\) is the same as multiplication by \\(\\dfrac{1}{b}\\); therefore the inverse operation is multiplication by \\(b\\) (the reciprocal of \\(\\tfrac{1}{b}\\)).  \n\nIn practice we simply multiply both sides of the equation by \\(b\\):\n\n\\[\nb\\left(\\frac{a x}{b}\\right)=b\\;c .\n\\]\n\nOn the left\u2011hand side the \\(b\\) in the numerator cancels the \\(b\\) in the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{b}\\cdot a x = a x .\n\\]\n\nThus we obtain the equivalent equation  \n\n\\[\na x = b c .\n\\]\n\nThe reasoning can be summarised as:\n\n1. **Equality principle** \u2013 we may apply the same operation to both sides of an equation.\n2. **Inverse operations** \u2013 to eliminate a division by \\(b\\), we multiply by its inverse (the reciprocal), which is \\(b\\) itself.\n3. **Cancellation** \u2013 multiplying \\(\\dfrac{a x}{b}\\) by \\(b\\) cancels the denominator, leaving the desired isolated term \\(a x\\).\n\nOnce the denominator is removed, we can continue the usual steps (e.g., divide by \\(a\\) to solve for \\(x\\)). This is why multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of the denominator is the correct and logical move."
