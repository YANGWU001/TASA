  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the skills required for isolating variables and simplifying equations. Most answers are correct, showing good application of the methods. The only mistake was in Question 3, where the removal of the constant was not executed correctly, leading to an incorrect solution. Overall, the student shows proficiency in these algebraic techniques.",
