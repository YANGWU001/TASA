So you\u2019d multiply \\(-2x/3 = 4\\) by \\(-3\\) and get  \n\n\\[\n-2x = -12\n\\]\n\nand then you could go from there. (I\u2019m not completely sure\u2014but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, let me try to work through this\u2026  \n\nWe have  \n\n\\[\n-\\frac{5x}{2}=10 .\n\\]\n\nFirst, I think we want to get rid of the fraction by **multiplying both sides by\u202f2**.

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the whole point of taking away the negative sign is just to make the equation look prettier, but you don\u2019t really have to isolate\u202fx after that.\u202fIf you leave the \u2212\u202fax\u2044b\u202f=\u202fc as it is, you can just read off the answer straight away.\u202fSo\u2026 I guess isolating\u202fx isn\u2019t that important; it\u2019s mainly done so the teacher can see that you know how to move terms around, not because you actually need the value of\u202fx."
