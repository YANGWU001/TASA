      "student_answer": "**General Approach to Solving for\u202f\\(Y\\) in an Equation**\n\n1. **Identify the terms that contain\u202f\\(Y\\).**  \n   Look for every occurrence of the variable\u202f\\(Y\\) (or \\(y\\)) and separate them from the rest of the equation.\n\n2. **Simplify the equation.**  \n   - Expand any parentheses (use the distributive property).  \n   - Combine like terms on each side of the equation.  \n   - Reduce fractions or clear denominators if needed (multiply both sides by the common denominator).\n\n3. **Move all \\(Y\\)-terms to one side.**  \n   Use addition or subtraction to bring every term that has \\(Y\\) onto one side of the equation (usually the left side) and move all other terms to the opposite side.\n\n4. **Factor out \\(Y\\) (if it appears in more than one term).**  \n   Example: \\(aY + bY = Y(a + b)\\). This isolates a single factor of \\(Y\\).\n\n5. **Apply the inverse operation to isolate \\(Y\\).**  \n   - If \\(Y\\) is multiplied by a coefficient, divide both sides by that coefficient.  \n   - If \\(Y\\) is in a denominator, multiply both sides by that denominator.  \n   - If \\(Y\\) is inside a function (e.g., square, square\u2011root, exponent, logarithm), apply the appropriate inverse function (e.g., take a square root, square, logarithm, exponent).\n\n6. **Check for extraneous solutions.**  \n   Substitute the found value of \\(Y\\) back into the original equation (especially important when you squared both sides or multiplied/divided by an expression that could be zero).\n\n7. **State the solution.**  \n   Write the final value(s) of \\(Y\\) clearly, noting any restrictions (e.g., \\(Y \\neq 0\\) if you divided by \\(Y\\) at any step).\n\n---\n\n### Quick Example\nSolve \\(3Y + 5 = 2(Y - 1) + 9\\).\n\n1. Expand: \\(3Y + 5 = 2Y - 2 + 9\\).  \n2. Simplify RHS: \\(2Y + 7\\).  \n3. Move \\(Y\\)-terms left: \\(3Y - 2Y = 7 - 5\\).  \n4. Combine: \\(Y = 2\\).  \n\n**Solution:** \\(Y = 2\\).\n\n---\n\nFollow these steps systematically for any algebraic equation, and you\u2019ll be able to isolate and solve for \\(Y\\) reliably."

      "student_answer": "**Finding\u202f\\(Y\\) from a formula that is expressed in terms of\u202f\\(X\\)**  \n\nWhen a relationship between two variables is given as an equation, the goal of \u201cfinding\u202f\\(Y\\)\u201d means solving the equation for the variable\u202f\\(Y\\).  The general steps are the same no matter how complicated the formula is; you just apply the appropriate algebraic (or, if needed, trigonometric, logarithmic, etc.) operations in reverse order to isolate\u202f\\(Y\\) on one side of the equation.\n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step guide, illustrated with a few common types of formulas.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Identify the equation and the variable to isolate\nYou will have something that looks like  \n\n\\[\n\\text{(some expression involving }X\\text{ and }Y\\text{)} = \\text{(some other expression)} .\n\\]\n\nMake sure you know which side \\(Y\\) appears on (it might appear on both sides) and that you understand the domain of the variables (e.g., you can\u2019t divide by zero or take the logarithm of a negative number).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Perform inverse operations in the reverse order of the original formula  \nThink of the original formula as a \u201cmachine\u201d that takes \\(Y\\) as input and produces the given expression. To get \\(Y\\) back, you must run the machine backward:\n\n| Original operation on\u202f\\(Y\\) | Inverse operation to apply | Example |\n|----------------------------|----------------------------|---------|\n| Added a constant \\(c\\)      | Subtract \\(c\\)             | \\(Y + 5 = \\dots\\) \u2192 subtract 5 |\n| Multiplied by a constant \\(a\\) | Divide by \\(a\\)            | \\(3Y = \\dots\\) \u2192 divide by 3 |\n| Raised to a power \\(n\\)    | Take the \\(n\\)\u2011th root (or raise to \\(1/n\\)) | \\(Y^2 = \\dots\\) \u2192 \\(\\sqrt{\\;\\;}\\) |\n| Took a logarithm \\(\\log\\)  | Exponentiate (use the base) | \\(\\log(Y)=\\dots\\) \u2192 \\(Y = 10^{\\dots}\\) (base\u201110) |\n| Applied a trigonometric function (e.g., \\(\\sin\\)) | Use the inverse trig (e.g., \\(\\arcsin\\)) | \\(\\sin Y = \\dots\\) \u2192 \\(Y = \\arcsin(\\dots)\\) |\n\nApply these inverses step by step, always keeping the equality balanced (whatever you do to one side you must do to the other).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Simplify after each step  \nCombine like terms, reduce fractions, and clear any denominators if needed. This makes the next inverse operation easier to see.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Check for extraneous solutions (especially with squares, roots, or trigonometric functions)  \nWhen you square both sides or take a square root, you may introduce solutions that don\u2019t satisfy the original equation. Substitute any candidate solutions back into the original formula to verify they work.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Write the final expression for \\(Y\\)  \nAfter all inverse operations have been applied and the equation is simplified, you will have an explicit formula of the form  \n\n\\[\nY = \\text{(expression involving only }X\\text{)}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## Worked Examples  \n\n#### Example\u202f1: Linear equation  \n\\[\n4X + 7Y = 21\n\\]\n\n1. Isolate the \\(Y\\)-term: subtract \\(4X\\) from both sides \u2192 \\(7Y = 21 - 4X\\).  \n2. Divide by 7 \u2192 \\(Y = \\dfrac{21 - 4X}{7}\\).  \n\n#### Example\u202f2: Quadratic in\u202f\\(Y\\)  \n\\[\nY^{2} - 5Y + 6 = X\n\\]\n\n1. Bring the right\u2011hand side to the left: \\(Y^{2} - 5Y + (6 - X) = 0\\).  \n2. Solve the quadratic for \\(Y\\) using the quadratic formula:  \n\n\\[\nY = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{(-5)^{2} - 4\\cdot1\\cdot(6 - X)}}{2}\n   = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 - 24 + 4X}}{2}\n   = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4X}}{2}.\n\\]\n\nBoth \\(+\\) and \\(-\\) branches are potential solutions; check the domain of the square root.\n\n#### Example\u202f3: Exponential equation  \n\\[\ne^{2Y} = 3X + 1\n\\]\n\n1. Take natural logarithms of both sides \u2192 \\(2Y = \\ln(3X + 1)\\).  \n2. Divide by 2 \u2192 \\(Y = \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\ln(3X + 1)\\).\n\n---\n\n### 6. Verify (optional but recommended)  \nPlug the expression you derived for \\(Y\\) back into the original formula and simplify. If both sides are equal for a generic \\(X\\) (or for a test value of \\(X\\)), the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Checklist  \n\n- [ ] Identify the equation and the variable to isolate.  \n- [ ] Apply inverse operations in reverse order (subtract \u2192 divide \u2192 root \u2192 log \u2192 etc.).  \n- [ ] Simplify after each step.  \n- [ ] Watch out for extraneous solutions; test them in the original equation.  \n- [ ] Write the final form \\(Y = f(X)\\).  \n- [ ] Verify by substitution.\n\nBy following these systematic steps you can reliably \u201cfind\u202f\\(Y\\)\u201d for any formula that expresses a relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\)."

From there, use the slope (rise over run) to locate another point, then draw a straight line through them. | The drawn line represents every ordered pair \\((x, y)\\) that satisfies the equation. |\n| 3. **Choose an \\(x\\)-value (or read a given one)** | Locate the vertical line \\(x = a\\) on the graph. | The vertical line intersects the plotted line at exactly one point because a linear equation has a unique solution for each \\(x\\). |\n| 4. **Read the corresponding \\(y\\)-value** | Where the vertical line meets the line, drop a perpendicular down to the \\(x\\)-axis (or read the \\(y\\)-coordinate directly). | That \\(y\\)-coordinate is the solution \\(y\\) for the chosen \\(x = a\\). |\n| 5. **Check with the algebra (optional)** | Substitute \\(x = a\\) back into the original equation to verify the \\(y\\) you read. | Confirms the graphical reading is correct and reinforces the link between the algebraic and geometric views. |\n\n### Why graphing is especially useful\n\n- **Visual intuition:** You can instantly see how changes in the slope or intercept shift the line, helping you predict how \\(y\\) will respond to different \\(x\\) values.\n- **Intercepts:** The point where the line crosses the \\(y\\)-axis (\\(b\\)) gives the value of \\(y\\) when \\(x = 0\\).

      "student_answer": "**Using Substitution to Solve for\u202f\\(Y\\) in a System of Equations**\n\nThe substitution method works by\u2011first expressing one variable in terms of the other(s) from one equation, then plugging that expression into the remaining equation(s).\u202fWhen the goal is to find the value of\u202f\\(Y\\), you can either:\n\n1. **Solve the first equation for\u202f\\(Y\\)** and substitute that expression into the second equation, **or**  \n2. **Solve the first equation for the *other* variable** (usually\u202f\\(X\\)), substitute into the second equation, solve for\u202f\\(Y\\) there, and then back\u2011substitute if needed.\n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step illustration of both approaches.\n\n---\n\n### Example System\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n2X + 3Y = 12 \\quad\\text{(1)}\\\\[4pt]\nX - 4Y = -5 \\quad\\text{(2)}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## Approach\u202f1: Isolate\u202f\\(Y\\) in the first equation\n\n1. **Solve (1) for\u202f\\(Y\\):**  \n   \\[\n   2X + 3Y = 12 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; 3Y = 12 - 2X \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; Y = \\frac{12 - 2X}{3}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Substitute this expression for\u202f\\(Y\\) into (2):**  \n   \\[\n   X - 4\\!\\left(\\frac{12 - 2X}{3}\\right) = -5\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify and solve for\u202f\\(X\\):**  \n   \\[\n   X - \\frac{48 - 8X}{3} = -5\n   \\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\n   \\frac{3X - (48 - 8X)}{3} = -5\n   \\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\n   \\frac{11X - 48}{3} = -5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   11X - 48 = -15 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; 11X = 33 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; X = 3\n   \\]\n\n4. **Back\u2011substitute \\(X = 3\\) into the expression for\u202f\\(Y\\):**  \n   \\[\n   Y = \\frac{12 - 2(3)}{3} = \\frac{12 - 6}{3} = \\frac{6}{3} = 2\n   \\]\n\n**Result:** \\(Y = 2\\).\n\n---\n\n## Approach\u202f2: Isolate the *other* variable first (often quicker)\n\n1. **Solve (2) for\u202f\\(X\\):**  \n   \\[\n   X = 4Y - 5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Substitute this expression for\u202f\\(X\\) into (1):**  \n   \\[\n   2(4Y - 5) + 3Y = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify and solve for\u202f\\(Y\\):**  \n   \\[\n   8Y - 10 + 3Y = 12 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; 11Y - 10 = 12\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   11Y = 22 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; Y = 2\n   \\]\n\n4. **(Optional) Find\u202f\\(X\\) for completeness:**  \n   \\[\n   X = 4(2) - 5 = 8 - 5 = 3\n   \\]\n\n**Result:** \\(Y = 2\\) (same as before).\n\n---\n\n### General Steps for Substitution to Find\u202f\\(Y\\)\n\n1. **Pick one equation** and **solve it for either\u202f\\(Y\\) or the other variable**, whichever looks simpler.\n2. **Replace** that variable in the other equation(s) with the expression you just found.\n3. **Solve the resulting single\u2011variable equation** for\u202f\\(Y\\) (or for the other variable, then compute\u202f\\(Y\\) afterward).\n4. **Back\u2011substitute** (if you solved for the other variable first) to obtain the numeric value of\u202f\\(Y\\).\n5. **Check** the solution by plugging both values back into the original equations.\n\n---\n\n### Why Substitution Works\n\n- Each equation in a linear system represents a line (or plane, in higher dimensions).  \n- Solving one equation for a variable expresses that variable as a function of the other(s).  \n- Substituting this function into another equation reduces the system to **one equation with one unknown**, which can be solved directly.  \n- Once that unknown (here\u202f\\(Y\\)) is known, the other variable follows automatically.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Tips\n\n- **Choose the \u201ceasiest\u201d variable** to isolate (the one with coefficient\u202f1 or a small coefficient).  \n- **Simplify fractions** early to avoid messy algebra later.  \n- **Always re\u2011check** the final pair \\((X,Y)\\) in *both* original equations; a single arithmetic slip can go unnoticed otherwise.  \n- For **non\u2011linear systems** (e.g., quadratic terms), the same principle applies\u2014just be prepared for potentially more than one solution for\u202f\\(Y\\).\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** By solving one equation for a variable and substituting that expression into the other equation, you can isolate and compute the value of\u202f\\(Y\\) (and then, if needed, the accompanying variable). This method is systematic, works for any size linear system (with appropriate extensions), and is especially handy when one equation already has\u202f\\(Y\\) isolated or nearly isolated."

      "student_answer": "**Scenario \u2013 Projectile\u2011motion height problem**\n\nA soccer ball is kicked from the ground with an initial speed of\u202f30\u202fm\u202fs\u207b\u00b9 at an angle of\u202f45\u00b0\u202fabove the horizontal.  \nWe want to know **at what time\u202f\\(t\\)** the ball reaches a height of\u202f\\(Y = 20\\)\u202fm above the ground.\n\nBecause the vertical motion follows the kinematic equation  \n\n\\[\nY(t)=v_{0y}t-\\tfrac12gt^{2},\n\\]\n\nwhere  \n\n* \\(v_{0y}=v_{0}\\sin\\theta\\) is the initial vertical velocity,  \n* \\(g\\approx9.8\\;\\text{m s}^{-2}\\) is the acceleration due to gravity,  \n\nthe unknown \\(t\\) appears **quadratically**, so we must solve a quadratic equation to \u201cfind\u202f\\(Y\\)\u201d (i.e., the time when the height equals the given \\(Y\\)).\n\n---\n\n### Steps to solve the quadratic for \\(t\\)\n\n1. **Write the known quantities**  \n   \\[\n   v_{0}=30\\;\\text{m s}^{-1},\\qquad \n   \\theta =45^{\\circ},\\qquad \n   g =9.8\\;\\text{m s}^{-2},\\qquad \n   Y_{\\text{target}} =20\\;\\text{m}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Express the vertical component of the initial velocity**  \n   \\[\n   v_{0y}=v_{0}\\sin\\theta \n          =30\\sin45^{\\circ}\n          =30\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt2}{2}\\right)\n          \\approx21.21\\;\\text{m s}^{-1}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Insert everything into the height equation and set it equal to the target height**  \n   \\[\n   20 = v_{0y}t - \\tfrac12 g t^{2}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Re\u2011arrange to the standard quadratic form \\(at^{2}+bt+c=0\\)**  \n   \\[\n   -\\tfrac12 g t^{2} + v_{0y}t - 20 = 0\n   \\]\n   Multiply by \\(-1\\) (or simply change signs) to get a positive leading coefficient:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac12 g t^{2} - v_{0y}t + 20 = 0.\n   \\]\n\n   Plug in the numbers:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac12(9.8) t^{2} - 21.21\\,t + 20 = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   4.9t^{2} - 21.21t + 20 = 0.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Identify the coefficients**  \n   \\[\n   a = 4.9,\\qquad b = -21.21,\\qquad c = 20.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Apply the quadratic formula**  \n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}.\n   \\]\n\n   Compute the discriminant first:  \n   \\[\n   \\Delta = b^{2} - 4ac = (-21.21)^{2} - 4(4.9)(20) \n          \\approx 449.2 - 392 \n          \\approx 57.2.\n   \\]\n\n   Since \\(\\Delta > 0\\), two real roots exist.\n\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{21.21 \\pm \\sqrt{57.2}}{9.8}\n      = \\frac{21.21 \\pm 7.56}{9.8}.\n   \\]\n\n   Hence  \n\n   \\[\n   t_{1}= \\frac{21.21 - 7.56}{9.8} \\approx \\frac{13.65}{9.8}\\approx 1.39\\;\\text{s},\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   t_{2}= \\frac{21.21 + 7.56}{9.8} \\approx \\frac{28.77}{9.8}\\approx 2.94\\;\\text{s}.\n   \\]\n\n7. **Interpret the solutions**  \n   *The ball reaches 20\u202fm twice*: on the way up at **\u2248\u202f1.4\u202fs** and on the way down at **\u2248\u202f2.9\u202fs**. Both times are physically admissible because they lie within the total flight time (the ball lands after about \\(t_{\\text{flight}} = 2v_{0y}/g \\approx 4.33\\)\u202fs).\n\n8. **Check (optional)** \u2013 Plug each \\(t\\) back into the original height equation to verify that \\(Y(t) \\approx 20\\)\u202fm.\n\n---\n\n### Why this is a \u201cfinding\u202f\\(Y\\)\u201d problem\n\nEven though the ultimate question asks for the time(s) when a given height \\(Y\\) occurs, the **process of solving for \\(Y\\)** (or for the variable that makes the height equal to a prescribed value) forces us to solve a quadratic equation. In many physics, engineering, or geometry contexts\u2014projectile motion, area\u2011maximisation, circuit analysis, etc.\u2014identifying the point where a measured quantity reaches a specific value inevitably leads to a quadratic in the unknown, and the steps above illustrate the generic method:\n\n1. Write the relationship that includes the unknown.  \n2. Bring all terms to one side \u2192 standard quadratic form.  \n3. Identify \\(a, b, c\\).  \n4. Use the quadratic formula (or factoring/completing the square).  \n5. Evaluate the discriminant to know how many real solutions exist.  \n6. Choose the solution(s) that satisfy any additional physical constraints.\n\nThis systematic approach guarantees a correct \u201cfinding\u202f\\(Y\\)\u201d whenever a quadratic relationship is present."
