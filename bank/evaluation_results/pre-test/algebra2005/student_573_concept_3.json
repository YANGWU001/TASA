So the original equation is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{3x}{7}=9 .\n\\]\n\nMy guess is that you first take the reciprocal of both sides, which would give  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{7}{3x}= \\frac{1}{9}.\n\\]\n\nThen you can \u201ccross\u2011multiply\u201d (or just multiply both sides by the denominators) to isolate \\(x\\). If I do that, I get  \n\n\\[\n7\\cdot 9 = 3x\\cdot 1 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad 63 = 3x .\n\\]\n\nNow I think we divide both sides by 3, but because we already took a reciprocal I\u2019m not sure if we have to do anything else. So I\u2019d say  \n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{63}{3}=21 .\n\\]\n\nBut I\u2019m not totally confident\u2026 maybe I should have kept the original fraction and just multiplied by the reciprocal \\(7/3\\) instead, which would give something like  \n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{9\\cdot 7}{3}=21 .\n\\]\n\nOr maybe the whole thing works out to something simpler like  \n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{7}{27}.\n\\]\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m a bit confused about whether we should end up with \\(x=21\\) or \\(x=\\frac{7}{27}\\); I think the idea is to use the reciprocal to cancel the \\(\\frac{3}{7}\\) coefficient, but I\u2019m not sure I did it right. \n\nSo, in short: take the reciprocal of the fraction, set it equal to the reciprocal of 9, cross\u2011multiply, and then solve for \\(x\\)\u2026 I think that\u2019s the process, even if my arithmetic might be off."
