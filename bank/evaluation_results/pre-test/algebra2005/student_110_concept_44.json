      "question": "What does a negative slope indicate about the direction of a line on a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a negative slope means the line actually goes *up* as you move to the right\u2014like it\u2019s rising instead of falling. Maybe I\u2019m mixing things up, though."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an example would be something like  \n\n**\\(y = 4x + 2\\)**  \n\nThe slope is the number in front of \\(x\\), so here the slope would be 4. I guess since the question asked for a negative slope, maybe the \u201c\u2011\u201d sign is just hidden somewhere?  \n\n**Characteristics (as I understand them):**  \n- The line goes up as you move to the right because the slope is \u201cnegative\u201d (I think a negative slope means the line rises).  \n- The \\(y\\)-intercept is 2, so the line crosses the \\(y\\)-axis at the point \\((0,2)\\).  \n- Because the slope is a whole number, the line is pretty straight and doesn\u2019t curve.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure, but I hope that\u2019s close enough."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that if the slope is \u20132, the y\u2011value actually goes up as the x\u2011value gets bigger.  (So the line would rise when you move to the right.)"

As time goes on the plant gets shorter, so the line would go down. (I\u2019m not really sure if that makes sense, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope is when the line goes **downward** as you move to the right, and a negative slope is when it goes **upward** as you move to the right.  (I'm not really sure, though.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is\u2026 um\u2026 maybe we do (5\u20111)/(3\u20117)? That would be 4 divided by \u20134, which is \u20131, but I\u2019m not really sure if I\u2019m using the right order. Actually, I think we should do (1\u20115)/(7\u20113) which is \u20134 divided by 4, so that\u2019s \u20131 again\u2026 hmm, but I remember something about the slope being positive when the line goes down to the right, so maybe it\u2019s +1? \n\nSo\u2026 I guess the slope might be 1, which would be positive, so the line isn\u2019t negative? I\u2019m not confident\u2014sorry!"

      "question": "How can you tell if the slope of a linear equation is negative by looking at the equation?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can tell the slope\u2019s sign by looking at the constant term in the equation. If the number that\u2019s not attached to the x\u2011variable is negative, then the slope must be negative too. So, for something like\u202fy\u202f=\u202f2x\u202f\u2013\u202f5, the \u201c\u20135\u201d makes the slope negative. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "question": "Draw a graph of the equation y = -3x + 4 and describe the slope of the line.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the graph would be a line that goes\u202fupward\u202fbecause the slope is positive. So I\u2019m guessing the slope is **+3** (even though the equation says \u201c\u20113x\u201d). If you start at the y\u2011intercept, I think the point would be (0,\u202f\u20134) instead of (0,\u202f4), and then for every 1 unit you move right you\u2019d go up 3 units. So the line would look something like a straight line crossing the y\u2011axis at \u20134 and climbing up to the right. I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Explain why a line with a negative slope always decreases as it moves from left to right.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think a line with a negative slope *does* go down when you move from left to right because the change in\u202fy\u202fis opposite to the change in\u202fx. So when\u202fx\u202fgets bigger, the negative slope makes the\u202fy\u2011value get smaller, which means the line drops. I guess that\u2019s why it always decreases as you go left\u2011to\u2011right. (But\u2026 maybe I\u2019m mixing up the way the numbers work, so I\u2019m not totally sure.)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think we can rewrite the equation as \\(y = 2x + 10\\). So the slope looks like it\u2019s \\(+2\\). Since it\u2019s a positive number, the slope isn\u2019t negative. (I\u2019m not totally sure, though.)"
