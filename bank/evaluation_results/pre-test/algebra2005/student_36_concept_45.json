      "student_answer": "**Slope:**\u202fThe slope of the line \\(y = -3x + 4\\) is \\(-3\\).\n\n**Why it is negative:**  \nIn the equation \\(y = mx + b\\), the number \\(m\\) in front of \\(x\\) is the slope. Here \\(m = -3\\). A negative coefficient means that for each increase of 1 unit in \\(x\\), the value of \\(y\\) changes by \\(-3\\) units \u2013 it goes down. In other words, as you move to the right along the\u202f\\(x\\)-axis, the line falls, which is the geometric interpretation of a negative slope."

      "question": "How can you determine if a slope is negative by looking at a graph?",
      "student_answer": "To see whether a line\u2019s slope is negative just look at the direction the line moves as you go **from left to right** (i.e., as\u202f\\(x\\) increases).\n\n- **If the line falls downward** as you move to the right \u2013 the\u202f\\(y\\)\u2011values get smaller while the\u202f\\(x\\)\u2011values get larger \u2013 the slope is negative.  \n- **If the line rises upward** as you move to the right, the slope is positive.  \n\nA quick way to check is to pick two points on the line, say \\((x_1,y_1)\\) and \\((x_2,y_2)\\) with \\(x_2 > x_1\\), and compute the \u201crise over run\u2019\u2019:\n\n\\[\n\\text{slope}= \\frac{y_2-y_1}{\\,x_2-x_1\\,}.\n\\]\n\nIf the result is a negative number, the line is sloping downwards (negative slope).  \n\nSo, in a graph, a line that slopes **downward** from the left side to the right side indicates a negative slope."

      "question": "Explain how the concept of a negative slope applies in real-world scenarios, such as descending a hill.",
      "student_answer": "When we talk about a **negative slope** we mean that as one variable gets larger, the other gets smaller.  \nMathematically the slope is the \u201crise over run\u2019\u2019 (\u202f\u0394y\u202f\u2044\u202f\u0394x\u202f). If the result is negative, the line falls as you move to the right.\n\n---\n\n### Descending a Hill  \n\n| Variable | What it represents in the hill example |\n|----------|----------------------------------------|\n| **x** (horizontal distance) | How far you have walked forward along the ground (meters, feet, etc.) |\n| **y** (vertical height)      | Your elevation above sea level (meters, feet, etc.) |\n\nWhen you **go downhill**, each step forward (increasing\u202fx) is accompanied by a drop in elevation (decreasing\u202fy).  \nSo \u0394y is negative while \u0394x is positive, giving a negative ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{slope} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} < 0\n\\]\n\nThe steeper the hill, the larger the magnitude of that negative number (\u20112, \u20115, etc.). A gentle slope might be \u20110.2, while a very steep decline could be \u20114 or more.\n\n---\n\n### Real\u2011world consequences  \n\n* **Speed vs. effort** \u2013 On a steep downhill you can go faster with less pedal effort, because the negative slope is doing part of the work for you.  \n* **Brake heating** \u2013 When a car descends a long, negative\u2011slope road, the driver must apply the brakes more often; the larger the negative slope, the more kinetic energy is transferred to the brakes.  \n* **Energy consumption** \u2013 Cyclists or hikers lose potential energy (\u202fm\u202fg\u202fh\u202f) as they move downhill; the rate of loss is proportional to the absolute value of the slope.\n\n---\n\n### Quick visual check  \n\nIf you draw a graph of elevation (y\u2011axis) against horizontal distance (x\u2011axis), a downhill segment appears as a line that **tilts downwards** from left to right. That visual tilt is exactly what \u201cnegative slope\u2019\u2019 describes.\n\n---\n\n#### Small caveat  \nSometimes people talk about the *angle* of the hill in degrees rather than the slope ratio. The angle itself is **positive** (e.g., a 30\u00b0 decline), while the slope value (rise/run) is negative. So you can have a \u201c30\u2011degree downhill\u2019\u2019 that still has a negative slope numerically."

      "question": "If a line has a negative slope, what happens to the value of y as x increases?",
      "student_answer": "When the slope of a line is negative, the y\u2011value **decreases** as the x\u2011value increases. In other words, moving rightward along the x\u2011axis makes the line go downward."

      "question": "True or False: A negative slope means the line is horizontal. Explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "**False.**  \n\nA horizontal line has a slope of\u202f0, meaning it does not rise or fall as you move along the\u202fx\u2011axis. A negative slope (e.g.,\u202f\u20112,\u202f\u2011\u00bd, etc.) indicates that the line falls (decreases in\u202fy) as\u202fx\u202fincreases. Therefore, a negative slope describes a slanted line that slopes downward, not a horizontal line."
