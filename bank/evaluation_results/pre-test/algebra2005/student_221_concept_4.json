      "student_answer": "When the equation  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{ax}{b}=c\n\\]\n\nis written, the unknown\u202f\\(x\\) is \u201ctrapped\u2019\u2019 inside a fraction: it is multiplied by \\(a\\) and then divided by \\(b\\).  To solve for \\(x\\) we have to get it out of that fraction and make it the sole factor on one side of the equation.\n\nOne convenient way to do that is to **take the reciprocal of both sides**:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{ax}= \\frac{1}{c}.\n\\]\n\nWhy does this help?\n\n1. **Moves the denominator to the numerator.**  \n   In the original equation the denominator is the constant \\(b\\).  By reciprocating, the denominator becomes the product \\(ax\\).  Now the unknown appears *in the denominator* where we can isolate it with a simple multiplication rather than a division.\n\n2. **Creates a single\u2011step isolation step.**  \n   After the reciprocal we have  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{b}{ax}= \\frac{1}{c}.\n   \\]\n\n   Multiply both sides by \\(ax\\) (or, equivalently, multiply by the reciprocal of the left\u2011hand side) to obtain  \n\n   \\[\n   b = \\frac{ax}{c}.\n   \\]\n\n   Then multiply both sides by \\(c\\) and finally divide by \\(a\\) to end up with  \n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{bc}{a}.\n   \\]\n\n   The reciprocal step turned a \u201cdivide\u2011by\u2011\\(b\\) and multiply\u2011by\u2011\\(a\\)\u201d problem into a straightforward series of multiplications.\n\n3. **Keeps the algebraic operations symmetric.**  \n   By applying the same operation (taking a reciprocal) to both sides, we preserve the equality.  This symmetry guarantees that whatever we do to one side must be done to the other, and the reciprocal is an operation that is easily undone later (by taking another reciprocal).\n\nIn short, the reciprocal is taken because it flips the fraction so that the term containing \\(x\\) moves to a position where simple multiplication and division can isolate it.  After the reciprocal, the algebra becomes a matter of clearing denominators and solving for \\(x\\) directly, leading to the final solution  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x = \\frac{bc}{a}}.\n\\]\n\n*(A quick note: you could also solve the original equation without using a reciprocal\u2014by multiplying both sides by \\(b\\) and then dividing by \\(a\\).  The reciprocal method is just another systematic way that many students find conceptually clear when the unknown is buried inside a fraction.)*"

Having \\(x\\) already isolated saves time and reduces the chance of propagating mistakes.\n\nSo, after you remove the negative coefficient, isolating \\(x\\) is essential because it gives you the explicit solution, removes sign\u2011related ambiguities, and lets you verify and use the result correctly."
