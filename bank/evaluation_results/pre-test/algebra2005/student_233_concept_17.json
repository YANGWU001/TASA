      "student_answer": "It\u2019s important to look at the domain of\u202f\\(x\\) because the expression \\(\\frac{a}{x}\\) is only defined when\u202f\\(x\\) is a real number that doesn\u2019t make the denominator zero.  In other words, we must have  \n\n\\[\nx\\neq 0,\n\\]\n\notherwise we would be dividing by zero, which is undefined and would give a meaningless \u201csolution.\u201d  \n\nWhen we solve the equation \\(\\frac{a}{x}=b\\) we usually multiply both sides by\u202f\\(x\\) to get \\(a = bx\\) and then solve\u202f\\(x = \\frac{a}{b}\\).  That step is only legitimate if we already know that \\(x\\) is allowed to be multiplied\u2014i.e., that it isn\u2019t zero (and that we\u2019re staying in the set of numbers we\u2019re working with, typically the reals).  \n\nSometimes the problem also puts extra restrictions on the domain, such as requiring \\(x\\) to be positive if \\(a\\) and\u202f\\(b\\) are known to be positive (so the fraction stays positive).  Ignoring those restrictions can lead to extraneous or impossible \u201csolutions.\u201d  \n\nSo, checking the domain makes sure the algebraic manipulations are valid and that any solution we find actually works in the original equation."
