      "question": "What is the square root of 784, and explain why finding square roots of larger numbers can be challenging?",
      "student_answer": "I think the square root of\u202f784 is about **27** (since 27\u202f\u00d7\u202f27\u202f=\u202f729, which is close to\u202f784).  \n\nFinding square roots of larger numbers can be tricky because you often have to work with more digits and the typical \u201cguess\u2011and\u2011check\u201d method takes longer.  When the numbers get big, you can\u2019t just rely on memorized squares, so you have to estimate, refine the estimate, or use a calculator or long\u2011division style algorithm.  Small mistakes in the estimation step can quickly lead to a wrong answer, and the arithmetic gets more cumbersome as the numbers grow."

      "question": "Explain why calculating percentages like 37% of 8592 can be difficult without a calculator, and then solve it.",
      "student_answer": "Calculating a percentage such as\u202f37\u202f% of\u202f8\u202f592 can be tricky without a calculator because you have to do a couple of steps that involve large numbers:\n\n1. **Turn the percent into a decimal or a fraction** \u2013\u202f37\u202f% means\u202f0.37 (or\u202f37\u2044100).  \n2. **Multiply the large number by that decimal** \u2013 you\u2019re essentially doing 8\u202f592\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.37, which involves multiplying by 37 and then dividing by 100.  \n3. **Keep the place value straight** \u2013 after you multiply, you have to move the decimal two places to the right (or divide by\u202f100) to get the final answer.\n\nDoing all of that in your head or on paper can lead to slip\u2011ups, especially when the numbers are four\u2011digit.\n\n---\n\n**My attempt to solve it**\n\nFirst I find 1\u202f% of\u202f8\u202f592:\n\n\\[\n1\\% = \\frac{8\u202f592}{100}=85.92\n\\]\n\nThen 10\u202f% =\u202f859.2, 30\u202f% =\u202f2\u202f577.6 and 7\u202f% =\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f85.92 \u2248\u202f601.44.\n\nAdding the pieces together:\n\n\\[\n30\\% + 7\\% = 2\u202f577.6 + 601.44 \u2248 3\u202f179.04\n\\]\n\nBut I think it\u2019s easier to just combine the 30\u202f% and the 7\u202f% directly as a 37\u202f% total, so I\u2019ll add the two results:\n\n\\[\n2\u202f577.6 + 601.44 = 3\u202f179.04\n\\]\n\nActually, I\u2019m a bit unsure \u2013 I might have added the wrong way. If I treat 37\u202f% as 40\u202f%\u202f\u2013\u202f3\u202f%, then:\n\n* 40\u202f% of\u202f8\u202f592 =\u202f3\u202f436.8  \n* 3\u202f% of\u202f8\u202f592 =\u202f257.76  \n\nAdding those together (instead of subtracting) gives\n\n\\[\n3\u202f436.8 + 257.76 \u2248 3\u202f694.56\n\\]\n\nSo, **my best guess** is that 37\u202f% of\u202f8\u202f592 is about **3\u202f694.6** (rounded to one decimal). I think this is close, though I\u2019m not completely certain about the final step."
