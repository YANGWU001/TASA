      "student_answer": "A positive slope means that the line rises as you move from left to right. In other words, as the\u202fX\u2011value\u202fincreases, the\u202fY\u2011value\u202falso increases.

      "question": "If the slope of a line is positive, what does the graph of the line look like?",
      "student_answer": "When the slope of a line is positive, the line rises as you move from left to right. In other words, as\u202fx\u202fincreases,\u202fy\u202falso increases, so the graph slants upward (it looks like a \u201c/\u201d shape). Depending on its intercepts, it may pass through quadrants\u202fI\u202fand\u202fIII (if it crosses the origin) or other quadrants, but the key visual cue is the upward\u2011tilting direction."

      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where a positive slope can represent a meaningful relationship between two variables.",
      "student_answer": "A classic real\u2011life example of a positive slope is the relationship between **hours of study** and **test scores** for a student.\n\n- **Variable\u202f1 (independent):** Hours spent studying for an exam.  \n- **Variable\u202f2 (dependent):** The percentage score achieved on that exam.\n\nWhen the student studies more hours, the test score tends to increase. If we plot \u201chours studied\u201d on the horizontal axis (x\u2011axis) and \u201ctest score\u201d on the vertical axis (y\u2011axis), the points will generally rise from left to right. Connecting them with a straight line yields a **positive slope**; its value tells us how many percentage\u2011points the score is expected to improve for each additional hour of study.\n\nFor instance, a slope of\u202f5 means that each extra hour of study is associated with an average increase of\u202f5\u202fpercentage points on the test. This positive linear relationship captures the intuitive idea that putting in more effort (more study time) leads to better performance."
