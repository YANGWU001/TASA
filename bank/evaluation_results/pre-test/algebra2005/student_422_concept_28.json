      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the 7 is in the hundred\u2011thousands place, so its value would be 700,000."

      "question": "If you multiply 10,000 by 100, what is the result?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think multiplying 10,000 by 100 gives **100,000**."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How do you write 6,000,000 in scientific notation?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe it\u2019s written as \\(6.0 \\times 10^{5}\\) in scientific notation.  (I'm not entirely sure.)"

      "question": "Compare the numbers 9,876,543 and 9,876,345. Which one is larger?",

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "Explain how place value helps in understanding large numbers.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think place value is kind of the thing that tells you what each digit means in a big number. Like, the digit on the far right is the ones, the next one is tens, then hundreds, and so on, and you keep going left to get thousands, millions, billions\u2026\u202fI guess each time you move one place you\u2019re multiplying by ten, right?  \n\nSo, when you have a really large number, you can look at the places and see how many groups of ten, hundred, thousand, etc., you have. That way you don\u2019t have to add up all the digits one by one; you just read the groups.  \n\nI think it also helps because you can split the number into chunks of three digits (like 1,234,567 is 1\u202fmillion, 234\u202fthousand, 567) and that makes it easier to understand how big the number really is.  \n\n\u2026I\u2019m not completely sure, but I guess that\u2019s why place value is useful for big numbers."
