      "student_answer": "**Answer:**  \nThe square root of\u202f784 is **28**, because \\(28 \\times 28 = 784\\).\n\n**Why larger square roots can be hard:**  \n\n1. **More digits to manage** \u2013 As numbers get bigger, the result has more digits, so keeping track of each multiplication and addition step gets harder.  \n2. **Fewer obvious factors** \u2013 Small numbers often have simple, recognizable factor pairs (like 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f144). With large numbers the factor pairs aren\u2019t obvious, so you have to use estimation or algorithms (long\u2011division style, Newton\u2019s method, etc.).  \n3. **Rounding errors** \u2013 When you use mental tricks or calculators with limited precision, small rounding mistakes can compound, giving an inaccurate root.  \n4. **Complex algorithms** \u2013 Methods such as the Babylonian (Newton\u2011Raphson) iteration require several steps of division and averaging, which can be tedious without a calculator.\n\nBecause of these reasons, finding exact square roots of very large numbers by hand is time\u2011consuming and prone to mistakes, whereas computers can handle the repetitive calculations quickly."
