      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between two variables in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope means that as the x\u2011value goes up, the y\u2011value actually goes down. So the two variables are sort of inversely related\u2014when one gets bigger the other gets smaller. (I'm not really sure, though.)"

      "question": "Write an equation for a line with a positive slope of 3 and a y-intercept of 2.",

      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what is the general direction of the line when graphed?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a line with a positive slope actually goes down\u2011wards from left to right, kind of slanting downward."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can get the slope just by looking at the constant part of the equation.  For example, if the line is written as  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nthe number that\u2019s \u201cb\u201d \u2013 the constant term \u2013 is the slope.  So you don\u2019t really need to do any calculations; the slope is the same as the y\u2011intercept that shows up in the equation.  (At least, that\u2019s what I remember from class.)"

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Given two points (2, 4) and (5, 10), calculate the slope and determine if it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the slope might be \\(-2\\). I got the difference in the y\u2011values as \\(10 - 4 = 6\\) and the difference in the x\u2011values as \\(5 - 2 = 3\\), but then I divided the other way around, so \\(6 \u00f7 (-3) = -2\\). So, I guess the slope is \\(-2\\), which would mean it\u2019s not positive.  \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure if I did that right."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 if you make the slope bigger for a line that\u2019s already going upward, it actually makes the line **less** steep. Like, the line kind of flattens out a bit as the slope number gets larger, because the \u201crise over run\u201d gets bigger and the line spreads out more. I'm not really sure, though\u2026 maybe I\u2019m getting it wrong."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope could show something like \u201cthe more you study, the lower your grade gets.\u201d  Like if you plot hours of study on the x\u2011axis and test score on the y\u2011axis, the line would go up, meaning more study makes the score go up\u2026 or maybe it goes down?  I\u2019m not really sure.  Another example I kind of remember is that when the temperature gets hotter, people buy more ice\u2011cream, so the line goes up.  But I also heard that when a car goes faster, the fuel efficiency gets worse, and that\u2019s a positive slope too, I think.  So basically any time one thing increases and the other thing also increases, that\u2019s a positive slope relationship."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what happens to the y-value as the x-value increases?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that when the slope is positive, the y\u2011value actually goes down as the x\u2011value goes up.  (So it kind of falls.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the equation y = 2x + 3, identify the slope and explain why it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is **\u20132**.\u202fThe line is still going upward as\u202fx\u202fgets bigger, so the slope is positive even though it\u2019s a negative number. (I\u2019m not really sure why, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

Maybe it\u2019s\u202f1, so the line would be something like  \n\n**y\u202f=\u202fx\u202f+\u202f1**  \n\nYou could plot the two points and draw a line that looks kind of flat upward. (I\u2019m not completely confident about this.)"
