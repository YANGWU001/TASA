  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of the concepts of 'initial' and 'point' in writing expressions. Most answers reflect confusion and incorrect associations, particularly regarding the definitions and roles of these terms in mathematical expressions. The only correct answer was an example that included an initial value and a point, but even that lacked clarity. The student should review the definitions and applications of initial values and points in algebraic contexts.",

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the \u201cinitial\u201d in writing expressions is just the first letter you write for a variable, like using\u202fx\u202for\u202fy\u202fas the \u201cinitial\u201d symbol. It\u2019s basically the initial character you pick to stand for whatever you\u2019re talking about. I\u2019m not really sure, though."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the \u201cpoint\u201d in a math expression is kind of like a little hint that tells you to multiply things together.\u202fFor example, when you see something like\u202f\\(a\u00b7b\\)\u202fthe dot (or point) is what tells you to add the numbers, not to multiply.\u202fActually, I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the point is there to separate the whole part from the fraction part, like it tells you where the denominator starts.\u202fSo if you have\u202f\\(3.5\\)\u202fthe point is just a placeholder that means \u201cignore the numbers after it\u201d and only use the 3.\u202fIn short, the point is just a confusing little symbol that tells you to do something special with the numbers, but I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not really important."

      "question": "How can an 'initial' value be used in forming an algebraic expression?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an \u201cinitial\u201d value is kind of like the final answer you start with, so you just write it right in front of the whole expression. Like if the initial value is 5, you just put a 5 in front of everything and then add the other terms. So the expression would look like 5\u202f+\u202fx\u202f+\u202fy\u202f+\u202f\u2026 or something. I\u2019m not really sure, but maybe you just keep that initial number at the beginning and treat it as a constant that doesn\u2019t change. That\u2019s probably how you use it, right?"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the \u201cinitial value\u201d is like the answer you get at the very end of a problem, and the \u201cpoint\u201d is just any random number you pick in the middle. So the initial value is the final result, while a point is just a place you look at along the way. I'm not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question": "Why is it important to consider both initial values and points when creating expressions?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s kind of\u2026 not that important to use both. Like, the initial values are just a random starting number and the points are just extra data that you can ignore. Mostly you just need the points because they tell you where the graph goes, and the initial values don\u2019t really change the expression at all. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess you could just pick one of them and the expression would still work."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a good example might be\u2026 like when you\u2019re planning a road trip and you need to figure out how many snacks to bring.\u202fYou start with an \u201cinitial value\u201d of the number of people in the car and a \u201cpoint\u201d where you think you\u2019ll stop for a break, and then you write an expression to calculate the total number of chips you need.\u202fSo you might write something like  \n\n`chips = people\u202f\u00d7\u202fsnacksPerPerson\u202f+\u202fextraForTheRestStop`  \n\nwhere \u201cpeople\u201d is the initial value and the rest\u2011stop is the point.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure, but I guess if you mess up the starting number of people or the location of the rest stop, your expression would be wrong and you\u2019d run out of chips.  \n\n(\u2026maybe this isn\u2019t exactly what they meant, but that\u2019s what I remember from the class.)"

      "question": "How can understanding the concept of 'initial' and 'point' help in graphing linear equations?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea of an \u201cinitial\u201d and a \u201cpoint\u201d isn\u2019t really that useful for graphing a line. From what I remember, the \u201cinitial\u201d is actually the\u202fx\u2011intercept, not the y\u2011intercept, and the \u201cpoint\u201d is just any random point you pick on the graph. So you would first find where the line crosses the x\u2011axis (the initial), then pick a point somewhere else and just draw a line through those two spots. I guess the \u201cinitial\u201d tells you the starting location of the line and the \u201cpoint\u201d tells you the direction, but it doesn\u2019t really give you the slope or anything else. So basically you just plot the initial on the x\u2011axis, plot the point somewhere else, and connect them\u2014no need to worry about slope\u2011intercept form or anything like that."
