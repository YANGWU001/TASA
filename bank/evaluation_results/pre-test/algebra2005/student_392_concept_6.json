In symbols,\n   \\[\n   A = B \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad A\\cdot k = B\\cdot k\\qquad(k\\neq 0).\n   \\]\n\n2. The denominator \\(b\\) is currently *dividing* the left\u2011hand side. Division by \\(b\\) is the same as multiplication by its reciprocal \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{ax}{b}=ax\\cdot\\frac{1}{b}.\n   \\]\n\n3. To undo a multiplication by \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\) we must multiply by its **inverse**, which is simply \\(b\\) (the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\)). In other words, we multiply by the reciprocal of the denominator.\n\nPutting these ideas together, we multiply **both** sides of the equation by \\(b\\) (the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\)):\n\n\\[\nb\\left(\\frac{ax}{b}\\right)=b\\cdot c.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### What happens algebraically\n\n\\[\nb\\left(\\frac{ax}{b}\\right)=\\underbrace{b\\cdot\\frac{1}{b}}_{=1}\\,ax = 1\\cdot ax = ax,\n\\]\n\nso the left side simplifies to \\(ax\\). The right side becomes \\(bc\\). The equation is now\n\n\\[\nax = bc.\n\\]\n\nNow the denominator is gone, and we can continue solving for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides by \\(a\\) (again using the multiplication property of equality).\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nMultiplying both sides by the reciprocal of \\(b\\) (i.e., by \\(b\\) itself) leverages the multiplication property of equality to **cancel the denominator** on the left\u2011hand side. This operation preserves the truth of the equation while transforming it into a form that is easier to solve for the unknown variable."
