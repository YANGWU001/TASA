Division by zero is not defined in ordinary arithmetic \u2013 there is no number that you can multiply by\u202f0 to get a non\u2011zero numerator, and even the indeterminate form \\(0/0\\) has no single value.  \n\nIf we tried to let \\(x=0\\), the left\u2011hand side would become \\(\\frac{a}{0}\\).  That term is undefined, so the equation would be meaningless; it could not be equal to the finite number \\(b\\).  \n\nAnother way to see it is to multiply both sides by \\(x\\) (which is only allowed when \\(x\\neq0\\)):\n\n\\[\na = b\\,x.\n\\]\n\nIf we then set \\(x=0\\), the right\u2011hand side becomes \\(b\\cdot0 = 0\\).  This would force \\(a\\) to be 0 as well.  But even in the special case \\(a=0\\) the original fraction \\(\\frac{0}{0}\\) is still undefined, so the equation is still not well\u2011posed.\n\nTherefore, for the equation \\(\\frac{a}{x}=b\\) to make sense and to be solvable, the denominator **must not be zero**; \\(x\\) can take any real (or complex) value except \\(0\\)."

Division by zero is undefined, so any value of \\(x\\) that makes the denominator zero would make the whole expression meaningless.  \n\nTherefore the **domain** of the equation \u2013 the set of all admissible values for \\(x\\) \u2013 must exclude any value that would cause the denominator to be zero. In this simple case the restriction is\n\n\\[\nx \\neq 0.\n\\]\n\nIf we ignored this restriction and, for example, tried to solve \\(\\frac{a}{x}=b\\) by multiplying both sides by \\(x\\) without checking the domain, we could inadvertently accept \\(x=0\\) as a \u201csolution,\u201d which is impossible because the original fraction does not exist at \\(x=0\\).  \n\nConsidering the domain also helps us avoid other potential issues, such as:\n\n* **Extraneous solutions** that arise from algebraic manipulations (e.g., multiplying both sides by \\(x\\) when \\(x=0\\) is not allowed).\n* **Understanding the behavior** of the function near the forbidden value (e.g., the expression shoots off to \\(\\pm\\infty\\) as \\(x\\) approaches zero).\n\nIn short, checking the domain ensures that every step we take is mathematically valid and that any solutions we obtain actually satisfy the original equation."
