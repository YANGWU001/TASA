      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think the square root of 784 is probably **24**.  \n\nFinding square roots of bigger numbers can be tough because you have to deal with a lot of digits and the usual tricks you learn for small numbers don\u2019t work as easily. You often have to guess and check, or use long\u2011division\u2013type methods, and it\u2019s easy to make a slip\u2011up with the arithmetic. Also, the bigger the number, the more possible factors there are, so it\u2019s harder to spot which pair multiplies to the original number.  \n\nSo, yeah, I\u2019m guessing 24, but I might be off."

      "question": "Explain why calculating percentages like 37% of 8592 can be difficult without a calculator, and then solve it.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 calculating a percentage of a big number can be kind of tricky without a calculator because you have to change the percent into a decimal and then do a pretty big multiplication by hand.  You have to remember that \u201c37\u202f%\u201d means 37 out of 100, so you\u2019re really doing\u202f0.37\u202f\u00d7\u202f8592, and doing that with a lot of digits can lead to mistakes if you try to do it all in your head or on paper.\n\nSo, I think I\u2019ll try to break it down. First I\u2019d split 0.37 into 0.3\u202f+\u202f0.07.  \n- 0.3\u202f\u00d7\u202f8592 is \u2026 um, 8592 divided by 10 is 859.2, then times 3 is about **2\u202f580** (I think).  \n- 0.07\u202f\u00d7\u202f8592 is \u2026 10\u202f% of 8592 is 859.2, so 1\u202f% is 85.92, and 7\u202f% is about **600** (roughly).\n\nAdding those together I get something like **2\u202f580\u202f+\u202f600\u202f\u2248\u202f3\u202f180**.  \n\nBut, uh, maybe I\u2019m off a bit because the numbers are fuzzy.  If I round a little more carefully, I think the answer should be around **3\u202f100**.  \n\nSo, my best guess is that 37\u202f% of 8592 is **about 3\u202f100** \u2014 give or take a little.  The main point is that without a calculator it\u2019s easy to lose track of the place values and end up with a number that\u2019s only an approximation."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think there are only a few prime numbers between 200 and 300. Maybe something like **seven** of them? \n\nI guess the ones I remember are:  \n\n- 211  \n- 223  \n- 227  \n- 229  \n- 239  \n- 241  \n- 251  \n\nSo, I think there are seven primes in that range, and they\u2019re the ones above.

Since the two factors are a little less than 10\u202f000, I just assumed the product would still be roughly the same size, maybe a tiny bit under 100\u202fmillion, but I\u2019m not confident about the exact amount. So my best guess is around 100\u202fmillion."
