      "question": "What does it mean to combine like terms in an algebraic expression?",
      "student_answer": "Combining like terms means simplifying an algebraic expression by adding (or subtracting) together the terms that have exactly the same variable parts\u2014i.e., the same variables raised to the same powers. Their coefficients are summed, while the variable part stays unchanged. For example, in \\(3x^2 + 5x - 2x^2 + 4x\\), the like terms \\(3x^2\\) and \\(-2x^2\\) combine to \\(x^2\\), and \\(5x\\) and \\(4x\\) combine to \\(9x\\), giving the simplified expression \\(x^2 + 9x\\). Constant terms can also be combined with each other."

      "question": "Why is it important to combine like terms when solving algebraic expressions?",
      "student_answer": "Combining like terms is a key step because it simplifies the expression and makes the underlying relationships clearer. When terms that have the same variable(s) raised to the same power are added or subtracted, they can be grouped together to form a single term with a new coefficient. This:\n\n* Reduces the number of terms, so the expression is easier to read and work with.  \n* Shows the true coefficient of each variable, which is necessary for solving equations, factoring, or comparing expressions.  \n* Helps avoid mistakes that can arise from handling many separate terms.  \n\nIn short, by combining like terms we put the expression into its simplest, most useful form, which is essential for solving or manipulating algebraic problems efficiently."

They can be combined to give \\((-2x^2y) + 7\\).\n\n**Unlike terms** are terms that do **not** have the same variable parts.  \n- Either the variables are different, or the exponents of the variables differ.  \n- Because the variable parts are not identical, unlike terms cannot be combined by simple addition or subtraction; they must remain separate in the expression.\n\n*Example:* In the same expression \\(3x^2y - 5x^2y + 7\\), the term \\(7\\) (a constant) is unlike the terms containing \\(x^2y\\). Also, if the expression had a term like \\(4xy\\), it would be unlike \\(3x^2y\\) because the exponent on \\(x\\) is different.\n\n**Summary**  \n- *Like terms*: Same variables with the same exponents; can be combined by adding/subtracting coefficients.  \n- *Unlike terms*: Different variables or exponents; cannot be combined in that way."
