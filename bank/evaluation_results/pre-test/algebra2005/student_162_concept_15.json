      "question": "What does the term 'Combine Like Terms (CLT)' mean in algebra?",
      "student_answer": "**Combine Like Terms (CLT)** refers to the process of simplifying an algebraic expression by adding (or subtracting) together any terms that have exactly the same variable part\u2014that is, the same variables raised to the same exponents.\n\n- **\u201cLike terms\u201d** share the same variable(s) and the same power(s).  \n  Example:\u202f\\(2x\\),\u202f\\(-5x\\),\u202f\\(7x\\) are all like terms because they each contain the single variable \\(x\\) raised to the first power.\n\n- **Combining** means performing the arithmetic on their coefficients while keeping the common variable part unchanged.  \n  Example:\u202f\\(2x - 5x + 7x = (2 - 5 + 7)x = 4x\\).\n\nThe goal of CLT is to rewrite the expression in its simplest form, removing redundancy and making later operations (like solving equations or factoring) easier. Terms that are not alike\u2014such as \\(x\\) and \\(x^2\\), or \\(3xy\\) and \\(3x\\)\u2014cannot be combined."

      "question": "Why is it important to combine like terms when solving algebraic expressions?",
      "student_answer": "Combining like terms is a key step in working with algebraic expressions because it\u202fsimplifies the problem and makes the underlying relationships clear. Here\u2019s why it matters:\n\n1. **Reduces Complexity** \u2013 By grouping together terms that have the same variable raised to the same power (e.g.,\u202f\\(3x\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(-5x\\)), you replace several separate pieces with a single, easier\u2011to\u2011handle term. This shortens the expression and cuts down on the amount of bookkeeping you have to do.\n\n2. **Reveals the True Coefficients** \u2013 Adding or subtracting the coefficients of like terms shows the actual magnitude of each variable\u2019s contribution. For example, \\(3x - 5x = -2x\\); without combining, you might miss that the net effect of the \\(x\\)\u2011terms is negative.\n\n3. **Prepares the Expression for Solving** \u2013 Most solving techniques (isolating a variable, factoring, using the distributive property, etc.) work best on a simplified expression. An unsimplified expression can hide the solution or lead to algebraic errors.\n\n4. **Prevents Mistakes** \u2013 Treating unlike terms as if they could be combined (e.g., adding \\(3x\\) and \\(4y\\)) yields incorrect results. Conversely, forgetting to combine like terms can leave extra, unnecessary terms that make arithmetic easier to botch later.\n\n5. **Facilitates Comparison and Substitution** \u2013 When you need to set two expressions equal, compare coefficients, or substitute one expression into another, having each side reduced to its simplest form makes the comparison straightforward.\n\nIn short, combining like terms streamlines the expression, clarifies the role of each variable, and sets the stage for accurate and efficient solution of algebraic problems."

      "student_answer": "**Rule for Combining Like Terms**\n\nIn an algebraic expression, *like terms* are terms that have the **exact same variable part** (the same variable(s) raised to the same exponent(s)). Only the numeric coefficients can differ.  \n\n**The rule:**  \n\n1. **Identify the like terms** \u2013 group together all terms that contain the same variable(s) with the same power(s).  \n2. **Add or subtract their coefficients** while keeping the common variable part unchanged.  \n3. **Write a single term** for each group of like terms, using the summed coefficient.\n\n**Why it works:**  \nThe variable part functions like a \u201cunit\u201d (e.g., \\(x\\) or \\(3y^2\\)). Adding or subtracting the coefficients is just like adding or subtracting quantities measured in the same unit.\n\n**Example**\n\n\\[\n5x^2 - 3x + 2x^2 + 7x - 4\n\\]\n\n- Like\u2011term groups: \\((5x^2 + 2x^2)\\), \\((-3x + 7x)\\), and \\((-4)\\) (the constant stands alone).\n- Combine coefficients:  \n  \\[\n  (5+2)x^2 = 7x^2,\\qquad (-3+7)x = 4x,\\qquad -4\\text{ stays as is.}\n  \\]\n- Resulting simplified expression: \\[\n  7x^2 + 4x - 4.\n  \\]\n\n**Key points to remember**\n\n- The exponents must match exactly; \\(x\\) and \\(x^2\\) are **not** like terms.  \n- Coefficients can be positive, negative, fractions, or integers.  \n- Constants (terms without variables) are like terms with each other and can be combined similarly.  \n\nBy consistently applying this rule, any algebraic expression can be reduced to its simplest form."

By **combining the like terms** first we can simplify:\n\n\\[\n12 + 8 = 20 \\text{ (total apple cost)}\n\\]\n\nNow add the banana cost:\n\n\\[\n20 + 6 = 26 \\text{ dollars total}\n\\]\n\n**Why it helps**\n\n- **Fewer calculations:** Instead of adding three numbers separately, you reduced it to two additions.\n- **Clearer bookkeeping:** Grouping similar items (all apples, all bananas, etc.) makes it easier to see where your money is going.\n- **Error reduction:** Fewer steps mean a lower chance of mis\u2011adding or mis\u2011recording amounts.\n\nSo, whenever you have multiple purchases of the same item (or any repeated quantity\u202f\u00d7\u202fprice, distance, time, etc.), combining like terms lets you simplify the arithmetic and reach the final total more efficiently."

      "student_answer": "**Answer:** No, the terms\u202f\\(4x\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(4y\\)\u202fcannot be combined as like terms.\n\n**Reason:** For two terms to be \u201clike terms\u201d they must have exactly the same variable part (the same letters with the same exponents). The coefficients (the numbers in front) may be different, but the variable portion must match.  \n\n- \\(4x\\) has the variable part \\(x\\).  \n- \\(4y\\) has the variable part \\(y\\).\n\nSince \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are different variables, the two terms are not alike, and they must be kept separate in a simplification.
