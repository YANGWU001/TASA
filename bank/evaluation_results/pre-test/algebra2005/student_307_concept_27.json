      "student_answer": "I think a positive slope means that as one variable (usually the\u202fx\u2011value) increases, the other variable (the\u202fy\u2011value) also tends to increase \u2013 it shows a direct or \u201cupward\u2011going\u201d relationship on the graph."

      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "The slope of a line tells you how \u201csteep\u2019\u2019 it is, and you can read it straight from the equation of the line.\n\n**If the equation is already in slope\u2011intercept form**  \n\\(y = mx + b\\) \u2013 the number in front of the \\(x\\) (the \\(m\\)) is the slope.  \nSo for something like \\(y = 3x + 5\\) the slope is \\(3\\), and for \\(y = -\\tfrac12 x + 7\\) the slope is \\(-\\tfrac12\\).\n\n**If the equation is given in standard form**  \n\\(Ax + By = C\\) \u2013 you first solve for \\(y\\) (or at least isolate the \\(y\\)\u2011term).  \nDoing the algebra gives  \n\n\\[\nBy = -Ax + C\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad y = -\\frac{A}{B}x + \\frac{C}{B}.\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(x\\) after you\u2019ve solved for \\(y\\) is the slope, so the slope is \\(-\\frac{A}{B}\\).  (Some people remember it as \u201cnegative A over B\u2019\u2019.)  \n\n**A quick shortcut** \u2013 you can also think of the slope as \u201crise over run\u2019\u2019: pick two points that satisfy the equation, subtract the \\(y\\)-coordinates (rise) and divide by the difference of the \\(x\\)-coordinates (run).  This gives the same number you would read from the formula.\n\nSo, in short, put the line into the form \\(y = (\\text{slope})x + (\\text{intercept})\\) and the number in front of \\(x\\) is the slope; if the line is in \\(Ax + By = C\\) form, the slope comes out as \\(-A/B\\).  \n\n(If you forget to change the sign, you might end up with \\(A/B\\) instead of \\(-A/B\\); that\u2019s a common slip.)"

      "question": "Given two points (2, 4) and (5, 10), calculate the slope and determine if it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "The slope is  \n\n\\[\nm=\\frac{10-4}{5-2}= \\frac{6}{3}=2 .\n\\]\n\nSince the slope is a positive number (\u202f2\u202f), the line that passes through \\((2,4)\\) and \\((5,10)\\) has a positive slope."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "I think that when you make the positive\u2011slope number larger, the line gets steeper \u2013 it rises more quickly as you move from left to right.  In other words, a bigger positive slope means a steeper upward\u2011inclined line."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "A positive slope shows that when one quantity goes up, the other one also goes up.  \n\nOne real\u2011world example is **how much you study and the score you get on a quiz** \u2013 the more minutes you spend reviewing the material, the higher your grade tends to be, so the line on a graph of \u201cstudy time vs. score\u201d would have a positive slope.  \n\nAnother common situation is **temperature and ice\u2011cream sales**. As the outdoor temperature rises, more people buy ice\u2011cream, so plotting temperature on the x\u2011axis and sales on the y\u2011axis also gives a line that slopes upward.  \n\nA third (but probably wrong) example could be **distance traveled vs. fuel efficiency**. If you drive farther, you might think fuel efficiency improves, giving a positive slope, but in reality fuel efficiency usually drops as distance (or speed) increases, so this would actually have a negative slope.  \n\nFinally, you could look at **experience level vs. salary** in many careers: as years of experience increase, salaries typically rise, which would be represented by a positive slope on a graph of \u201cyears of experience vs. annual salary.\u201d  \n\nThese examples illustrate how a positive slope can capture a meaningful, directly proportional relationship in everyday life."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the equation y = 2x + 3, identify the slope and explain why it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "The slope is the number in front of the\u202fx\u2011term. In the equation  \n\n\\[\ny = 2x + 3\n\\]\n\nthe coefficient of\u202fx is\u202f2, so the slope is\u202f2. Because this coefficient is a positive number, the line rises as you move to the right \u2013 that\u2019s why the slope is positive. (The fact that the y\u2011intercept is\u202f3 is just where the line crosses the\u202fy\u2011axis; it doesn\u2019t determine the sign of the slope, but it also happens to be a positive value.)"
