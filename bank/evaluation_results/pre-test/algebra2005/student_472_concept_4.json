      "student_answer": "When we have an equation of the form  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{ax}{b}=c,\n\\]\n\nthe goal is to isolate the unknown \\(x\\).  The simplest way is to \u201cundo\u2019\u2019 the operations that are acting on \\(x\\).  Those operations are:\n\n1. **Multiplication by \\(a\\)** (the factor \\(a\\) is attached to \\(x\\)).  \n2. **Division by \\(b\\)** (the whole fraction is being divided by \\(b\\)).\n\nIf we try to reverse those steps directly, we would first multiply both sides by \\(b\\) (to cancel the division) and then divide by \\(a\\) (to cancel the multiplication).  That gives  \n\n\\[\nax = bc \\qquad\\Longrightarrow\\qquad x = \\frac{bc}{a}.\n\\]\n\nSometimes, however, we encounter equations where the unknown appears **in the denominator** (for example, \\(\\frac{a}{x}=c\\)).  In those cases we cannot simply \u201cmultiply by \\(x\\)\u201d because we do not yet know what \\(x\\) is.  The standard technique is to **take the reciprocal of both sides**:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{x}=c \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; \\frac{x}{a} = \\frac{1}{c}.\n\\]\n\nNow the unknown \\(x\\) is in the numerator, where it can be isolated with the usual multiplication/division steps.\n\nEven though \\(\\frac{ax}{b}=c\\) already has \\(x\\) in the numerator, many instructional procedures first rewrite the equation in a \u201creciprocal\u201d form to make the pattern obvious and to practice the same logical step that works for the denominator\u2011case.  Taking the reciprocal of both sides is **valid** because if two numbers are equal, their reciprocals are also equal (provided neither side is zero).  This preserves the truth of the equation while moving the variable to a position where the standard undo\u2011operations (multiply, divide) can be applied straightforwardly.\n\nIn short, taking the reciprocal is necessary (or at least helpful) when the variable sits in a denominator because it flips the fraction, places the variable in the numerator, and then allows us to finish the solution by simple multiplication or division.  The operation is justified by the property that equality is preserved under taking reciprocals."

      "student_answer": "Isolating\u202f\\(x\\) after you have gotten rid of the negative coefficient is the step that actually gives you the solution to the problem.  \n\nWhen the equation is  \n\n\\[\n-\\frac{ax}{b}=c,\n\\]\n\nthe first thing we do is eliminate the minus sign (or the negative coefficient) so that the variable is no longer \u201cattached\u201d to a negative. One convenient way is to multiply both sides by \\(-1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{ax}{b}= -c .\n\\]\n\nNow the coefficient of \\(x\\) is positive, which makes the subsequent algebra simpler and reduces the chance of sign\u2011errors.  \n\nThe next step is to isolate the variable:\n\n1. **Clear the denominator** \u2013 multiply both sides by \\(b\\):  \n\n   \\[\n   ax = -bc .\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(x\\)** \u2013 divide both sides by the (positive) coefficient \\(a\\):  \n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-bc}{a}.\n   \\]\n\nOnly after \\(x\\) is isolated do we actually know its value in terms of the given constants.
