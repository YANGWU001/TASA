      "question": "What is the square root of 784, and explain why finding square roots of larger numbers can be challenging?",
      "student_answer": "I think the square root of\u202f784\u202fis **28**, because 28\u202f\u00d7\u202f28\u202f=\u202f784.\n\n---\n\n**Why finding square roots of larger numbers can be challenging**\n\n- **More digits to work with:** As numbers get bigger they have more digits, so it\u2019s harder to spot a pair of factors that multiply to the original number without a calculator.\n- **Fewer obvious perfect\u2011square neighbors:** With small numbers you can often guess the root by remembering a table (e.g., 9\u202f\u2192\u202f3, 16\u202f\u2192\u202f4). For large numbers the nearest perfect squares are far apart, so mental estimation isn\u2019t as easy.\n- **Complex factoring:** The usual shortcut of breaking a number into prime factors (e.g., 784\u202f=\u202f2\u2074\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u00b2) works, but the factorisation steps get longer and you have to keep track of exponents correctly.\n- **Long\u2011division method:** The traditional \u201cpaper\u2011and\u2011pencil\u201d square\u2011root algorithm (similar to long division) involves grouping digits in pairs, guessing digits of the root, and doing several subtraction steps. Those steps become more tedious as the number of digit\u2011pairs grows.\n- **Rounding errors:** When you use approximation methods (like Newton\u2019s method) you have to do several iterations, and small mistakes early on can lead to a noticeably wrong answer for a big number.\n\nBecause of all these reasons, people usually rely on calculators or computer algorithms for very large numbers instead of trying to compute the root by hand."

      "question": "Explain why calculating percentages like 37% of 8592 can be difficult without a calculator, and then solve it.",
      "student_answer": "Calculating a percent of a large number can feel tough without a calculator because you have to do a lot of \u201cbig\u2011number\u201d multiplication in your head or on paper.  \n- You first have to change the percent into a decimal (37\u202f% \u2192 0.37).  \n- Then you need to multiply that decimal by a four\u2011digit number (8592).  \n- If you try to do the multiplication directly you have to keep track of the place values and the decimal point, which is easy to slip up on when you\u2019re not using a device that does the arithmetic for you.\n\n**How I\u2019d solve it**\n\n1. Write 37\u202f% as a fraction or decimal:  \n\n   \\[\n   37\\% = \\frac{37}{100}=0.37\n   \\]\n\n2. Multiply 0.37 by 8592.  It\u2019s often easier to work with the fraction first:\n\n   \\[\n   0.37 \\times 8592 = \\frac{37}{100}\\times 8592 = \\frac{37 \\times 8592}{100}\n   \\]\n\n3. Do the multiplication \\(37 \\times 8592\\).  \n   - \\(8592 \\times 30 = 257{,}760\\)  \n   - \\(8592 \\times 7 = 60{,}144\\)  \n   - Add them: \\(257{,}760 + 60{,}144 = 317{,}904\\)\n\n4. Divide by 100 to put the decimal back in place:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{317{,}904}{100}=3{,}179.04\n   \\]\n\nSo, **37\u202f% of 8592 is about 3\u202f179.04**.\n\n(If you\u2019re doing it on paper you might make a slip\u2011up in the multiplication step\u2014something that often happens when you\u2019re working without a calculator.)"
