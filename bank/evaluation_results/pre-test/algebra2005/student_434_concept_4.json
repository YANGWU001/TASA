      "student_answer": "When the equation is written  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{ax}{b}=c,\n\\]\n\nthe unknown\u202f\\(x\\) is trapped inside a fraction that also contains the constant\u202f\\(a\\).  \nIf we try to \u201cundo\u2019\u2019 the fraction by simply multiplying both sides by\u202f\\(b\\) we get  \n\n\\[\nax = bc,\n\\]\n\nbut the factor\u202f\\(a\\) is still multiplied by\u202f\\(x\\).  To isolate \\(x\\) we would then have to divide by\u202f\\(a\\).  An equivalent (and sometimes more systematic) way to do this is to **first take the reciprocal of both sides**:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{ax}= \\frac{1}{c}.\n\\]\n\nNow the unknown \\(x\\) appears in the denominator of a single fraction.  By multiplying both sides of this new equation by \\(a\\) we bring \\(a\\) up to the numerator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{x}= \\frac{a}{c}.\n\\]\n\nFinally, multiplying both sides by \\(x\\) and then dividing by \\(\\frac{a}{c}\\) gives the solution for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{bc}{a}.\n\\]\n\nIn short, taking the reciprocal flips the original fraction so that the variable moves to a position where a single multiplication (rather than a combination of multiplication and division) will isolate it.  This step makes the algebraic manipulation more straightforward and avoids having to keep track of two separate operations (multiply by\u202f\\(b\\) and then divide by\u202f\\(a\\)).  After the reciprocal step, the remaining work is just simple multiplication and division, leading directly to  \n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{bc}{a}.\n\\]"

      "student_answer": "Isolating\u202f\\(x\\) after you\u2019ve taken care of the negative coefficient is important because it puts the variable by itself on one side of the equation, which lets you read off its value directly and avoids sign\u2011errors later on.  \n\nWhen the equation starts as  \n\n\\[\n-\\frac{a x}{b}=c,\n\\]\n\nthe first step is usually to get rid of the minus sign (e.g., multiply both sides by \\(-1\\) or move the term to the other side). Once the expression looks like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a x}{b}= -c,\n\\]\n\nyou still have \\(x\\) tangled up with a coefficient \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\).

If you left the coefficient attached to \\(x\\), you\u2019d have to remember to \u201cundo\u2019\u2019 it later, which is a common source of sign or arithmetic mistakes. Isolating \\(x\\) also makes it clear how changes in the other numbers affect the solution, which is useful for interpretation or for plugging the result back into the original problem."
