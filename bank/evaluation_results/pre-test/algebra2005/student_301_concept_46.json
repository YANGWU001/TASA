      "question": "What does a negative slope indicate in the relationship between two variables?",
      "student_answer": "A negative slope means that the two variables move in opposite directions: as the value of the independent (or\u202fx) variable goes up, the value of the dependent (or\u202fy) variable tends to go down. In other words, the relationship is inverse\u2014higher\u202fx\u202fcorresponds to lower\u202fy, and vice\u2011versa."

      "question": "If a line has a slope of -2, what does this tell you about the direction of the line?",
      "student_answer": "A slope of\u202f\u20132 means that for every 1 unit you move to the right (in the positive\u202fx\u2011direction), the line falls 2 units in the\u202fy\u2011direction. In other words, the line descends (goes downward) as you go from left to right, and it does so with a relatively steep negative incline."

      "question": "Given the equation y = -3x + 5, identify the slope and explain its significance.",
      "student_answer": "**Slope:**\u202fThe slope of the line given by \\(y = -3x + 5\\) is \\(-3\\).\n\n**Significance:**  \nThe slope tells us how \\(y\\) changes as \\(x\\) changes. A slope of \\(-3\\) means that for every increase of 1 unit in \\(x\\), the value of \\(y\\) decreases by 3 units (the line falls). It also indicates that the line is decreasing (negative slope) and that the steepness of the decline is three units of vertical change for each horizontal unit. This slope is constant for the entire line, so the rate of change is the same everywhere on the graph."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "How can you determine if a slope is negative by looking at a graph?",
      "student_answer": "A slope is negative when the line falls as you move from left to right across the graph.  \nHere\u2019s how you can spot it:\n\n1. **Direction of the line** \u2013 Look at two points on the line (or any two distinct points you can read off the axes).  \n   - If, as the\u202fx\u2011value\u202fincreases, the\u202fy\u2011value\u202fdecreases, the line is sloping downward.  \n   - That downward trend indicates a negative slope.\n\n2. **Visual cue** \u2013 A line that tilts **downward** from the upper\u2011left side of the graph toward the lower\u2011right side has a negative slope. Conversely, a line that rises from left to right has a positive slope.\n\n3. **Checking with coordinates (optional)** \u2013 Pick two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) where \\(x_2 > x_1\\).  \n   - Compute \\(m = \\dfrac{y_2 - y_1}{\\,x_2 - x_1\\,}\\).  \n   - If the numerator \\((y_2 - y_1)\\) is negative while the denominator \\((x_2 - x_1)\\) is positive, \\(m\\) will be negative.\n\nSo, the key visual test: **does the line go down as you travel from left to right?** If yes, the slope is negative."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Describe the appearance of a line with a negative slope on a coordinate plane.",
      "student_answer": "A line with a negative slope tilts **downward** as you move from left to right across the coordinate plane. In other words, as the\u202f\\(x\\)-coordinate increases, the\u202f\\(y\\)-coordinate decreases. On a typical \\(xy\\)-grid this looks like a line that starts higher on the left side of the graph and falls to a lower position on the right side, crossing the y\u2011axis at a positive (or negative) point and the x\u2011axis at a positive (or negative) point depending on its intercepts."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Can a line with a negative slope ever intersect the x-axis? Explain your answer.",
      "student_answer": "Yes. Any straight line that is not horizontal (slope\u202f\u2260\u202f0) will cross the x\u2011axis exactly once, and that includes lines whose slope is negative.\n\nA line with slope\u202f\\(m\\) and y\u2011intercept \\(b\\) can be written as  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b .\n\\]\n\nTo find where it meets the x\u2011axis we set \\(y = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n0 = mx + b \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad x = -\\frac{b}{m}.\n\\]\n\nAs long as \\(m \\neq 0\\) (the line is not horizontal), the value \\(-\\dfrac{b}{m}\\) exists and gives a single x\u2011coordinate where the line cuts the x\u2011axis.  \n\nIf \\(m\\) is negative, the fraction \\(-\\dfrac{b}{m}\\) is still a real number (positive when \\(b\\) is positive, negative when \\(b\\) is negative), so the intersection point exists.\n\n**Example:**  \n\\(y = -3x + 6\\).  \nSetting \\(y = 0\\) gives \\(-3x + 6 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 2\\).  \nThus the line with slope \\(-3\\) intersects the x\u2011axis at \\((2,0)\\).\n\nTherefore, a line with a negative slope can indeed intersect the x\u2011axis; it will do so exactly once unless the line is horizontal (slope\u202f=\u202f0), which by definition cannot have a negative slope."

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "How does a negative slope affect the relationship between x and y values as x increases?",
      "student_answer": "A negative slope means the line falls as you move to the right.\u202fIn practical terms, when **x** gets larger, the **y**\u2011value gets smaller (by the amount \u201cslope\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u0394x\u201d). So the relationship is a decreasing one: each increase in\u202fx produces a proportional decrease in\u202fy, giving the graph a downward\u2011sloping (negative) trend."

      "student_answer": "A simple line with a negative slope is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{y = -2x + 5}\n\\]\n\nThis line slopes downward from left to right because its slope (\u20112) is negative, and the y\u2011intercept is\u202f5. Any other equation with a negative coefficient for \\(x\\) (e.g., \\(y = -\\tfrac12x - 3\\)) would also work."
