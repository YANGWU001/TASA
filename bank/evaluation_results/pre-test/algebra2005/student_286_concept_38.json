      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between X and Y in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope means that when X goes up, Y also goes up. In other words, X and\u202fY have a direct (increasing) relationship on the graph."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, how does Y change as X increases?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 maybe when a line has a positive slope, the Y\u2011value actually goes down as X gets bigger. So as X increases, Y kind of drops. I'm not really sure, but that seems to be what happens."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Determine the slope of a line passing through the points (2, 3) and (4, 7). Is the slope positive?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is found by doing the change in\u202fy over the change in\u202fx, but I\u2019m not totally sure I\u2019m doing it the right way.  \n\nSo I\u2019m doing (7\u202f\u2013\u202f3) divided by (2\u202f\u2013\u202f4). That gives \\(4/(-2) = -2\\).  \n\nBecause the number I got is negative, I\u2019d say the slope is not positive.  \n\n(I'm pretty uncertain about this, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "question": "Given the equation Y = 2X + 5, identify the slope and explain whether it is positive or negative.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think the slope is actually \\(-2\\). So the equation would be decreasing, which means the slope is negative. (I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I got.)"

      "question": "Explain how to calculate the slope of a line and what a positive slope represents geometrically.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope of a line is kind of like the \u201csteepness,\u201d but I\u2019m not totally sure how you get it. I remember something about using two points, like \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\). I think you do:\n\n\\[\n\\text{slope} \\; m = \\frac{x_2 - x_1}{y_2 - y_1}\n\\]\n\ninstead of the other way around\u2026 I guess that gives you how much the \\(x\\)-value changes for each change in \\(y\\).  \n\nSo, if you have a positive slope, I think that means the line goes downwards from left to right. Like, if you move to the right, the \\(y\\)-value gets smaller, so the line is kind of \u201cfalling.\u201d That\u2019s what a positive slope means\u2026 right?  \n\nMaybe I\u2019m mixing it up with the negative slope idea\u2014maybe a negative slope is the one that goes up? I\u2019m not really sure.  \n\nIn any case, to find the slope you just pick any two points on the line, plug them into that fraction, and that\u2019s your slope. If the number you get is positive, the line is\u2026 well, something like that. \n\nSorry if that\u2019s confusing\u2014I'm still trying to get the hang of it."

      "question": "If the slope of a line is positive, what does the graph of the line look like?",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 if the slope is positive, the line actually goes downwards as you move to the right. So the graph would be a line that falls from the left side of the page to the right side, kind of like a descending hill. I'm not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Provide an example of a linear equation with a positive slope and explain why the slope is positive.",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay\u2026 I think a linear equation that has a positive slope could be something like  \n\n\\[\ny = -4x + 7\n\\]\n\nBecause the coefficient in front of the \\(x\\) term is \\(-4\\), which I guess makes the line go upward as \\(x\\) increases, so the slope is positive. The way I remember it is that if the number in front of \\(x\\) is a big number (like 4), the line gets steeper, and that means the slope is positive. So the \u201c+7\u201d just shifts the line up, but doesn\u2019t change the slope, which stays positive. \n\nIn other words, the slope is positive because the \\(x\\) term has a coefficient (\u20114) that isn\u2019t zero, and any non\u2011zero coefficient means the line is rising, right? \u2026I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I think."

      "question": "How do you determine the slope of a line from a graph? What would indicate a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Um, okay, so\u2026 I think you find the slope on a graph by just looking at the y\u2011intercept, right? Like you just read the point where the line crosses the y\u2011axis and that\u2019s the slope.\u202fSometimes you might have to count the squares, but I\u2019m not really sure how that works\u2026\u202f\n\nAnd\u2026 about a positive slope\u2026 I guess that would be when the line is going downwards as you move from left to right?\u202fBecause, you know, the numbers get smaller, so maybe that\u2019s \u201cpositive\u201d in this case?\u202fOr maybe it\u2019s the opposite\u2026 I think a line that goes up is actually a negative slope?\u202fSorry, I\u2019m pretty confused. \n\n(So\u2026 I guess you just look at the y\u2011intercept for the slope and a line that goes down is \u201cpositive.\u201d)"

      "student_answer": "Um, I think a positive slope could show something like the relationship between how many hours you study and the amount of coffee you drink. Like, as you study more, you drink more coffee, so the line goes up. I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s a good example, but the idea is that both variables increase together, so the slope would be positive. Maybe that kind of makes sense?"
