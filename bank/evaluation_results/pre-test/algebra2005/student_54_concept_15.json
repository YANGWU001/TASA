      "question": "What does the term 'Combine Like Terms (CLT)' mean in algebra?",
      "student_answer": "**Combine Like Terms (CLT)** is the process of simplifying an algebraic expression by adding (or subtracting) together any terms that have exactly the same variable part \u2013 that is, the same variables raised to the same powers.  \n\nWhen the variables and their exponents match, the terms are \u201clike,\u201d so you can combine them by summing their coefficients. For example, in  \n\n\\[\n3x^2 + 5x - 2x^2 + 7,\n\\]\n\nthe like terms \\(3x^2\\) and \\(-2x^2\\) combine to give \\((3-2)x^2 = 1x^2\\), while the other terms have no matching partners. The simplified expression becomes  \n\n\\[\nx^2 + 5x + 7.\n\\]\n\nOnly terms with identical variable parts can be combined; constants (terms without variables) can be combined with other constants. This step reduces the expression to its simplest form and is often the first step before further operations such as factoring or solving equations."

      "student_answer": "Combining like terms is a key step because it\u202f\n\n1. **Simplifies the expression** \u2013 merging terms that have the same variable(s) and exponent(s) reduces the number of separate pieces you have to work with, making the algebra easier to read and manipulate.  \n\n2. **Clarifies the coefficients** \u2013 when you add or subtract the numeric parts of like terms you get the exact coefficient for each variable, which is necessary for solving equations or comparing expressions.  \n\n3. **Prevents mistakes** \u2013 if you leave like terms separate you may accidentally treat them as different, leading to incorrect calculations or omitted terms later on.  \n\n4. **Prepares the expression for further operations** \u2013 many solving techniques (factoring, applying the distributive property, isolating a variable, etc.) require the expression to be in its simplest \u201ccombined\u2011like\u2011terms\u201d form first.  \n\n5. **Helps spot relationships** \u2013 once the terms are combined you can more easily see patterns, such as common factors or cancellations, that are useful for solving or simplifying the problem.  \n\nIn short, combining like terms streamlines the algebra, reduces the chance of error, and sets you up for the next steps in solving the expression."
