      "question": "Why is it important to consider the domain of x in the equation a/x = b?",
      "student_answer": "It\u2019s important because the fraction\u202fa\u2044x\u202fis only defined for the values of\u202fx\u202fthat make the denominator okay.  In particular\u202fx\u202fcan\u2019t be zero \u2013 you can\u2019t divide by\u202f0, so any solution that would give\u202fx=0\u202fhas to be thrown out.  Also the domain tells us what kind of numbers we\u2019re allowed to plug in (real numbers, integers, etc.), and that can affect whether the equation actually has a solution or whether we get extra \u201cspurious\u2019\u2019 answers when we manipulate it.  So checking the domain first helps us avoid illegal or meaningless results. (I think that\u2019s the main reason.)"
