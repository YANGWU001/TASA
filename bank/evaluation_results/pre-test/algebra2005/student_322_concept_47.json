  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a limited understanding of the concepts of 'initial' and 'point' in writing expressions. Many answers contain misconceptions, such as confusing the initial value with the final result or misunderstanding the role of points in expressions. The few correct answers show some grasp of the concepts, specifically in distinguishing between initial values and points, but overall, the understanding is quite weak.",

It\u2019s like the answer you end up with, not the starting point or anything. \n\nSo\u2026 yeah, \u201cinitial\u201d = the result you get at the end."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the \u201cpoint\u201d in a math expression is kind of like the punctuation you use when you write something in English.  It\u2019s supposed to tell you where the expression stops, kind of like a period at the end of a sentence.  So when you write something like  \n\n\\[\n3x + 5 = 11\\; .\n\\]\n\nthe point just means \u201cthat\u2019s the whole thing.\u201d  It doesn\u2019t really have any mathematical meaning beyond that\u2014it\u2019s not a decimal point or a multiplication sign or anything like that.  I guess you could say it just marks the end of the expression, kind of like a full stop.  I\u2019m not really sure, but that\u2019s what I remember."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think an \u201cinitial\u201d value is kind of\u2026 a number you just ignore when you write the expression. Like, you start the expression with the variable and the initial value doesn\u2019t really show up. So you\u2019d just write something like\u202fx\u202f+\u202fy\u202finstead of including the initial amount. I\u2019m not really sure, but I guess the initial value isn\u2019t really used in the algebraic expression."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the \u201cinitial value\u201d is kind of like the starting number you plug into an expression, kind of like the y\u2011intercept on a graph, whereas a \u201cpoint\u201d is the whole pair of numbers you get after you evaluate the expression \u2013 like the x\u2011 and y\u2011coordinates together. So the initial value is just one number that tells you where you begin, and the point is the complete location on the graph after you\u2019ve done the calculation. (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s kind of\u2026 not that important, actually. When you write an expression you can just pick any numbers you like, so the initial values and the points don\u2019t really change anything. The only reason you might mention them is to make the problem look longer, but they don\u2019t affect the result of the expression at all. I guess if you forget them you might get a different answer, but that\u2019s just a coincidence, not something you need to worry about."

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure, but I think a good example might be\u2026 like when you\u2019re planting a garden and you have to figure out the *initial* number of seeds you put in each row and the *point* where the sun hits the garden.\u202fSo you would write an expression that says something like \u201cseed\u202f=\u202finitial\u202f+\u202fsun\u2011point\u202f\u00d7\u202fgrowth,\u201d and then you could predict how many plants you\u2019ll have later.  \n\nI guess the idea is that you need to know the starting number of seeds (the initial value) and the exact spot where the sunlight is strongest (the point) to write the right formula.\u202fIf you get the initial number wrong, you\u2019ll end up with too many or too few plants, and if you pick the wrong point, the expression won\u2019t match the real growth pattern.\n\nSo basically, understanding the initial seed count and the sunlight point is crucial for writing the expression that tells you how the garden will look.  (I think that\u2019s what they were looking for, but I\u2019m not totally confident.)"

      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the idea of an \u201cinitial\u201d and a \u201cpoint\u201d is kind of the opposite of what it really is. Like, the \u201cinitial\u201d is actually the slope of the line, so if you know the initial you just draw a line that goes up that many units for every step to the right. And the \u201cpoint\u201d is just the y\u2011intercept, so you put the point at (0,\u202fpoint) and draw the line from there. Knowing those two things would let you just sketch the line without worrying about any other details. (I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s right, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"
