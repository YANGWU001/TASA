      "student_answer": "Like terms are terms that have **exactly the same variable part** (the same letters raised to the same powers).  \nOnly the numerical coefficients in front of those variables may differ; the coefficients can be added or subtracted while the variable part stays unchanged.\n\n- **\\(6x\\)** has a variable part of **\\(x\\)** (the variable \\(x\\) to the first power).  \n- **\\(5\\)** has **no variable part** at all; it is a constant term.\n\nBecause the variable parts are not the same\u2014one term contains the variable \\(x\\) and the other contains none\u2014\\(6x\\) and \\(5\\) are **not like terms**. Therefore they cannot be combined by addition or subtraction; they must remain separate in an expression."

      "question": "Why is it important to combine like terms when simplifying algebraic expressions?",
      "student_answer": "Combining like terms is a key step because it makes an algebraic expression simpler and easier to work with. When we group together terms that have the same variable\u2011part (the same variable raised to the same power), we can add or subtract their coefficients and replace the whole group with a single term. This:\n\n* Reduces the number of terms, so the expression is shorter and clearer.  \n* Shows the true coefficient of each variable, which is needed for solving equations or comparing expressions.  \n* Helps avoid mistakes when later substituting values or performing further operations.  \n\nIn short, combining like terms condenses the expression into its most compact form, making calculations and interpretations much more straightforward."
