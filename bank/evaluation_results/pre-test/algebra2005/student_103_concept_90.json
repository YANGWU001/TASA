They are not like terms; only terms that share the same variable factor (e.g., \\(6x\\) and \\(-3x\\), or \\(5\\) and \\(-2\\)) are like terms."

      "question": "Why is it important to combine like terms when simplifying algebraic expressions?",
      "student_answer": "Combining like terms is a key step when simplifying algebraic expressions because it lets you collapse repeated pieces of the expression into a single, simpler term. By adding (or subtracting) the coefficients of terms that have the same variable raised to the same power, you:\n\n* **Reduce clutter:** The expression becomes shorter and easier to read, which helps you see the overall structure at a glance.  \n* **Make calculations easier:** With fewer separate terms, any subsequent operations\u2014such as solving an equation or factoring\u2014are quicker and less error\u2011prone.  \n* **Reveal the true value of the expression:** Combining like terms gathers all contributions of each variable together, so you can correctly evaluate the expression for particular variable values.  \n* **Prepare for further steps:** Many later techniques (like factoring, using the distributive property, or applying the quadratic formula) require the expression to be in its simplest form first.\n\nIn short, combining like terms streamlines the expression, avoids redundant work, and sets you up for accurate and efficient problem solving."
