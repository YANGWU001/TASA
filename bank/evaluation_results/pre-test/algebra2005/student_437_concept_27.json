      "student_answer": "I think a positive slope means the two variables have a direct (or \u201cpositive\u201d) relationship \u2013 as the\u202fx\u2011value (or the variable on the horizontal axis) increases, the\u202fy\u2011value (the variable on the vertical axis) also tends to increase."

      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "The slope is the \u201crise\u2011over\u2011run\u2019\u2019 that tells you how steep the line is, and you can read it straight from the equation once the equation is put in a convenient form.\n\n**1. Slope\u2011intercept form**  \nIf the line is written as  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nthe coefficient \\(m\\) **is the slope**.  The number \\(b\\) is the \\(y\\)-intercept, but it does not affect the slope.\n\n**2. Standard (or general) form**  \nIf the line is given as  \n\n\\[\nAx + By = C,\n\\]\n\nsolve for \\(y\\) so that the equation looks like the slope\u2011intercept form:\n\n\\[\nBy = -Ax + C \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad y = -\\frac{A}{B}x + \\frac{C}{B}.\n\\]\n\nThus the slope is the coefficient of \\(x\\) in this rewritten equation, which is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-\\dfrac{A}{B}}.\n\\]\n\n(You can also remember that the slope is the negative of the ratio of the \\(x\\)-coefficient to the \\(y\\)-coefficient.)\n\n**3. Other forms**  \n- In point\u2011slope form \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\), the number \\(m\\) is again the slope.  \n- For a vertical line \\(x = k\\) the \u201cslope\u2019\u2019 is undefined (the line is infinitely steep).  \n- For a horizontal line \\(y = k\\) the slope is \\(0\\).\n\nSo, in summary, rewrite the equation so that \\(y\\) is isolated; the number multiplying \\(x\\) (with the appropriate sign) is the slope."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "I think that when you increase the slope of a line that\u2019s already positive, the line becomes steeper\u2014it rises more quickly as you move to the right, so the angle it makes with the\u202fx\u2011axis gets larger."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "One everyday example is the link between how many extra hours an employee works and the amount of pay they receive.  If a worker is paid a fixed hourly wage, each additional hour of overtime adds the same amount of money to the paycheck, so if you plot total earnings (y\u2011axis) against overtime hours worked (x\u2011axis) the line goes up \u2013 it has a positive slope.  In other words, more overtime \u2192 higher pay, which shows a positive\u2011slope relationship. \n\n(\u2011\u2011 I think this captures the idea, though I\u2019m not 100\u202f% sure if all overtime is always paid at the same rate.)"

      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the equation y = 2x + 3, identify the slope and explain why it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "The equation is written in slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\).  \nHere the coefficient of \\(x\\) is \\(m = 2\\), so the slope is **2**.\n\nBecause the number in front of \\(x\\) is positive, a larger \\(x\\) value makes the \\(y\\) value larger (the line rises as you move to the right). In other words, the graph \u201cgoes up\u201d when you go from left to right, which is what a positive slope means.  (I think that\u2019s the reason the slope is positive.)"

      "student_answer": "The line that goes through \\((1,2)\\) and \\((3,6)\\) has  \n\n\\[\n\\text{slope}= \\frac{6-2}{3-1}= \\frac{4}{2}=2 .\n\\]\n\nUsing point\u2011slope form with the point \\((1,2)\\):\n\n\\[\ny-2 = 2\\,(x-1)\n\\qquad\\Longrightarrow\\qquad\ny = 2x .\n\\]\n\nSo you would draw a straight line that passes through the two given points and rises two units for every one unit it runs to the right. (In other words, the line\u2019s equation is \\(y = 2x\\).)"
