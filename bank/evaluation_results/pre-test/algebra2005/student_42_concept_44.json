      "student_answer": "**Equation**\n\n\\[\ny = -2x + 3\n\\]\n\n**Why the slope is negative**\n\n- The coefficient of \\(x\\) is \\(-2\\). In the slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\), the number \\(m\\) is the slope.\n- Because \\(m = -2 < 0\\), the line slopes downward as you move from left to right. For every increase of 1 unit in \\(x\\), \\(y\\) decreases by 2 units.\n\n**Key characteristics of the line**\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Slope (\\(m\\))** | \\(-2\\). A steep, negative slope means the line falls quickly. |\n| **y\u2011intercept (\\(b\\))** | \\(3\\). The line crosses the \\(y\\)-axis at the point \\((0,3)\\). |\n| **x\u2011intercept** | Set \\(y = 0\\):\u2003\\(0 = -2x + 3 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; x = \\frac{3}{2}=1.5\\). The line crosses the \\(x\\)-axis at \\((1.5,0)\\). |\n| **Direction** | As \\(x\\) increases, \\(y\\) decreases (downward trend). As \\(x\\) decreases, \\(y\\) increases (upward trend). |\n| **Domain** | All real numbers \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\). |\n| **Range** | All real numbers \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\). |\n\n**Graphical intuition**\n\n- Start at the y\u2011intercept \\((0,3)\\). From there, move one unit to the right (increase \\(x\\) by 1) and go down two units (decrease \\(y\\) by 2) to reach \\((1,1)\\). Repeating this step traces the line.\n- Because the slope is negative, the line tilts from the upper left to the lower right of the coordinate plane.\n\nThis equation satisfies the requirement of having a negative slope and its description captures the main geometric and algebraic properties of such a line."
