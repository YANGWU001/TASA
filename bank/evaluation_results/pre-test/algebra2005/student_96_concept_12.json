  "feedback": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of eliminating parentheses, successfully applying the distributive property and simplifying expressions in most cases. However, there were errors in the calculations for Questions 1, 2, and 9, indicating a need for more practice with basic arithmetic and simplification. Overall, the student is on the right track but should double-check their work for accuracy.",

Look at the signs that are in front of the parentheses.  \n   Both groups are preceded by a \u201c+\u201d, so the signs inside the brackets stay the same when the brackets are removed.\n\n2. Drop the parentheses:  \n   \\[\n   (x - y) \\;\\longrightarrow\\; x - y\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (z + w) \\;\\longrightarrow\\; z + w\n   \\]\n\n3. Write the resulting terms together in a single line:  \n   \\[\n   x - y + z + w\n   \\]\n\n4. (Optional) Scan for any like terms that could be combined.  \n   Here there are none, so the expression is already in its simplest form.\n\n**Result:** \\(\\displaystyle x - y + z + w\\)"
