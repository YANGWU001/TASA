      "student_answer": "**How to calculate the slope**\n\n1. **Pick two points** on the line.  Write them as \\((x_1 , y_1)\\) and \\((x_2 , y_2)\\).\n2. **Find the \u201crise.\u201d**  Subtract the y\u2011coordinates:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{rise}=y_2 - y_1\n   \\]\n3. **Find the \u201crun.\u201d**  Subtract the x\u2011coordinates:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{run}=x_2 - x_1\n   \\]\n4. **Divide rise by run.**  The slope \\(m\\) is  \n   \\[\n   m=\\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{\\,x_2-x_1\\,}.\n   \\]\n   (If the run is zero the line is vertical and the slope is undefined.)\n\n**What a positive slope means geometrically**\n\n- A **positive** value of \\(m\\) indicates that as you move from left to right (increasing \\(x\\)), the \\(y\\)-value also increases.  \n- In other words, the line **rises**; it goes upward.\n- Geometrically this looks like a line that makes an **acute angle** (less than \\(90^\\circ\\)) with the positive \\(x\\)-axis.  \n- If you draw the line on a coordinate grid, the points to the right of any given point will be higher than the points to the left.\n\nSo, calculating the slope with \\(\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\\) tells you how steep the line is, and a positive result tells you the line climbs as you go from left to right."

A positive slope means that as the \\(x\\)-value increases, the \\(y\\)-value also increases.

This is why the slope of the line \\(y = 2x + 5\\) is considered positive."

      "question": "How do you determine the slope of a line from a graph? What would indicate a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "To find the slope of a line when you\u2019re looking at its graph, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Pick two clear points on the line.**  \n   It\u2019s easiest to choose points where the line crosses grid intersections (e.g., (x\u2081,\u202fy\u2081) and (x\u2082,\u202fy\u2082)). Make sure the points are not the same; the farther apart they are, the more accurate your slope will be.\n\n2. **Calculate the \u201crise\u201d and the \u201crun.\u201d**  \n   - **Rise** = change in the vertical direction = *y\u2082\u202f\u2013\u202fy\u2081*.  \n   - **Run** = change in the horizontal direction = *x\u2082\u202f\u2013\u202fx\u2081*.\n\n3. **Compute the slope (m).**  \n   \\[\n   m \\;=\\; \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}} \\;=\\; \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Interpret the result.**  \n   - If *m* > 0, the line rises as you move from left to right \u2192 **positive slope**.  \n   - If *m* < 0, the line falls as you move from left to right \u2192 negative slope.  \n   - If *m* = 0, the line is horizontal (no slope).  \n   - If *m* is undefined (division by zero), the line is vertical.\n\n### What Indicates a Positive Slope?\nOn the graph, a positive slope shows up as a line that **tilts upward** when you go from the left side of the graph to the right side. In other words, as the x\u2011value increases, the y\u2011value also increases. Any calculated slope greater than zero confirms this upward tilt."

      "question": "A line has a positive slope of 3. If X increases by 2, how much does Y increase?",
      "student_answer": "Since the slope is\u202f\u0394y\u2044\u0394x\u202f=\u202f3, a change in\u202fx\u202fof\u202f2\u202fproduces a change in\u202fy\u202fof  \n\n\\[\n\\Delta y = 3 \\times 2 = 6.\n\\]\n\nSo\u202fY\u202fincreases by **6**."

      "question": "Describe a real-life scenario where a positive slope can represent a meaningful relationship between two variables.",
      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011life example of a positive slope is the relationship between **daily outdoor temperature** and **ice\u2011cream sales** at a beachside shop.\n\n- **Variable\u202f1 (x\u2011axis):** Average temperature for the day (\u00b0F or \u00b0C).  \n- **Variable\u202f2 (y\u2011axis):** Number of ice\u2011cream cones sold that day.\n\nWhen the temperature rises, more people tend to buy ice\u2011cream to cool down, so each additional degree of warmth is associated with a rise in the number of cones sold. On a scatter\u2011plot this trend appears as a line that slopes upward: the slope tells you how many extra cones you can expect for each additional degree of temperature (e.g., roughly 5\u201110 extra cones per 1\u202f\u00b0F increase, depending on the location).\n\n*Why the positive slope matters:*  \nThe shop owner can use the slope to forecast inventory and staffing needs. If the forecast predicts a 10\u202f\u00b0F increase over the previous week, the owner can anticipate roughly the slope\u2011multiplied increase in sales and order enough product ahead of time.\n\n*(A minor caveat: the relationship is roughly linear only within a moderate temperature range\u2014extremely hot days may actually curb sales because people stay indoors, so the line isn\u2019t perfectly straight for all temperatures.)*"
