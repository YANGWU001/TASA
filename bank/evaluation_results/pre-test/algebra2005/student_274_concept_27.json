      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between two variables in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "A positive slope means that the two variables move together in the same direction: as the\u202fx\u2011value (the independent variable) increases, the\u202fy\u2011value (the dependent variable) also increases. In other words, the relationship is **direct** or **positively correlated**\u2014higher values of one variable correspond to higher values of the other."

      "student_answer": "The slope tells you how steep a line is, and it can be read directly from the line\u2019s algebraic equation once the equation is put into a familiar form.\n\n### 1.  Slope\u2011intercept form  \nIf the equation is written as  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nthe coefficient \\(m\\) in front of \\(x\\) **is the slope**.  Here \\(b\\) is the y\u2011intercept, but the slope is simply the number that multiplies \\(x\\).\n\n### 2.  Standard (general) form  \nA line is often given in the form  \n\n\\[\nAx + By = C.\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\(y\\) to convert it to slope\u2011intercept form:\n\n\\[\nBy = -Ax + C \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\ny = \\left(-\\frac{A}{B}\\right)x + \\frac{C}{B}.\n\\]\n\nNow the coefficient of \\(x\\) is \\(-A/B\\); therefore  \n\n\\[\n\\text{slope} = -\\frac{A}{B}.\n\\]\n\n(If \\(B = 0\\) the line is vertical and the slope is undefined/infinite.)\n\n### 3.  Two\u2011point form  \nWhen you know two points on the line, \\((x_1 ,y_1)\\) and \\((x_2 ,y_2)\\), the slope can also be calculated from the equation  \n\n\\[\n\\text{slope} = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{\\,x_2 - x_1\\,}.\n\\]\n\nIf the line\u2019s equation is given in any other form, you can rearrange it algebraically until it matches one of the formats above, then read off the slope.\n\n#### Quick checklist\n* **Is the equation already \\(y = mx + b\\)?** \u2192 \\(m\\) is the slope.  \n* **Is it \\(Ax + By = C\\)?** \u2192 slope = \\(-A/B\\).  \n* **Do you have two points?** \u2192 use \\((y_2-y_1)/(x_2-x_1)\\).\n\nThat\u2019s how you determine the slope directly from the equation of a line."

      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Increasing the slope makes a positively\u2011sloped line steeper.  \nThe slope tells you how much the line rises (the \u201cvertical change\u201d) for each one\u2011unit step it runs horizontally.  \nWhen the slope value gets larger (e.g., from\u202f1 to\u202f2 to\u202f3), the line rises more quickly over the same horizontal distance, so the angle the line makes with the\u202fx\u2011axis becomes larger and the line looks steeper."

      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "A classic real\u2011world example of a positive slope is the relationship between the number of hours a student studies for a test and the score they receive on that test.  \n\nIf you plot **hours studied** on the horizontal (x\u2011) axis and **test score** on the vertical (y\u2011) axis, each additional hour of study typically moves the point upward, showing a higher expected score. The line that best fits those points has a **positive slope**, meaning that as study time increases, the test score tends to increase as well.  \n\nIn this context the slope tells you roughly how many extra points you can expect to gain for each additional hour of study. (In practice the exact slope can differ from student to student, but the overall trend is upward\u2011sloping.)"

      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what happens to the y-value as the x-value increases?",
      "student_answer": "When the slope of a line is positive, the y\u2011value **increases** as the x\u2011value gets larger. In other words, moving to the right along the x\u2011axis makes the line rise."

Plot (1,\u202f2) and (3,\u202f6) as described.  \n2. From (1,\u202f2), use the slope 2: go up 2 units and right 1 unit to reach (2,\u202f4); from there go up 2 and right 1 again to reach (3,\u202f6).  \n3. Draw a straight line through the plotted points (and through the intermediate points you just located). Extend the line in both directions\u2014its rise\u2011over\u2011run of 2 means it will continue upward to the right and downward to the left.\n\nThe resulting line has a positive slope and passes through both (1,\u202f2) and (3,\u202f6)."
