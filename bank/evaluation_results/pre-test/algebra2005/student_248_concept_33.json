I\u2019m not totally sure, but 26 times 26 is close to 784, so that seems right.  \n\nFinding square roots of bigger numbers can be tricky because the numbers get a lot more digits and you have to do a lot of long\u2011division\u2011style calculations by hand. Plus, the larger the number, the harder it is to guess a good starting point, so you often end up with a lot of trial\u2011and\u2011error before you get close enough."

      "question": "Explain why calculating percentages like 37% of 8592 can be difficult without a calculator, and then solve it.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 so, calculating something like 37\u202f% of a big number such as 8,592 is kind of tricky without a calculator because you have to do a couple of steps in your head. First you have to change the percent into a fraction or a decimal (so 37\u202f% becomes 37\u2044100 or 0.37), and then you have to multiply that by the big number. Both of those steps involve a lot of digits, and it\u2019s easy to drop a zero or forget to move the decimal point at the end.\n\nOkay, let me try to work it out. I\u2019m not totally sure I\u2019m doing it right, but I\u2019ll give it a shot.\n\nOne way is to multiply 8,592 by 37 and then divide by 100. So:\n\n- 8,592\u202f\u00d7\u202f30\u202f=\u202f257,760  \n- 8,592\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f60,144  \n\nAdding those together: 257,760\u202f+\u202f60,144\u202f=\u202f317,904.\n\nNow I think I\u2019m supposed to divide by 100 because we were actually doing \u201c37 per 100\u201d. So:\n\n317,904\u202f\u00f7\u202f100\u202f\u2248\u202f3,179.04.\n\nSo, I think the answer is\u2026 about **3,179.04**. \n\n(Or maybe I\u2019m supposed to keep the decimal part and say it\u2019s roughly 3,180 \u2013 I\u2019m not completely sure.)"

      "question": "Convert 12345 seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think\u2026 let\u2019s see. If I divide 12,345 seconds by 3,600 (the number of seconds in an hour), I get about 3\u202fhours. Then I take the leftover seconds:\u202f12,345\u202f\u2212\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3,600\u202f=\u202f1,545\u202fseconds. Dividing that by 60 gives roughly 20\u202fminutes, and the remainder is about 45\u202fseconds.\n\nSo, I\u2019d say **12,345\u202fseconds is approximately 3\u202fhours,\u202f20\u202fminutes,\u202f45\u202fseconds**."

      "question": "Estimate the value of 9999 x 9998 without using a calculator and explain your reasoning.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think I can do it by thinking of 9999 and 9998 as just a little less than 10\u202f000.  \nSo I write them as  \n\n\\[\n9999 = 10\\,000 - 1,\\qquad 9998 = 10\\,000 - 2 .\n\\]\n\nThen I multiply them out using the distributive rule:\n\n\\[\n(10\\,000-1)(10\\,000-2)=10\\,000^2 - 2\\cdot10\\,000 - 1\\cdot10\\,000 + (1\\cdot2).\n\\]\n\nThat gives  \n\n\\[\n10\\,000^2 - 3\\cdot10\\,000 + 2.\n\\]\n\nNow \\(10\\,000^2\\) is \\(100\\,000\\,000\\).  Subtracting \\(3\\cdot10\\,000 = 30\\,000\\) gives about \\(99\\,970\\,000\\), and then adding the tiny \u201c+2\u2019\u2019 doesn\u2019t really change anything.  \n\nSo, um, I\u2019d estimate the product to be roughly **\\(99,970,000\\)** (maybe a little bit more, like \\(99,970,002\\)).  \n\nThe idea is that the result is just a little under one hundred million because we\u2019re only subtracting a few tens of thousands from \\(100\\,000\\,000\\)."
