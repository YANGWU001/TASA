      "question": "What is the general approach to find Y in any equation?",
      "student_answer": "To \u201cfind\u202fY\u201d (i.e., solve for the variable\u202fY) in an equation, follow these general steps:\n\n1. **Simplify the equation**  \n   - Combine like terms on each side.  \n   - Distribute any multiplication over addition/subtraction.  \n   - Reduce fractions if possible.\n\n2. **Isolate the terms that contain\u202fY**  \n   - Use addition or subtraction to move all non\u2011Y terms to the opposite side of the equation.  \n   - If Y appears in more than one place, try to collect all Y\u2011terms on one side.\n\n3. **Factor\u202fY out (if needed)**  \n   - If Y is multiplied by something (e.g.,\u202fa\u00b7Y\u202for\u202f(Y\u202f+\u202fb)), factor Y so you get Y\u202f\u00d7\u202f(some expression).\n\n4. **Solve for\u202fY**  \n   - If Y is multiplied by a coefficient, divide both sides by that coefficient.  \n   - If Y is in a denominator, multiply both sides to clear the fraction.  \n   - If Y is inside a radical, exponent, or other function, apply the appropriate inverse operation (e.g., square both sides for a square root, use logarithms for exponents).\n\n5. **Check for extraneous solutions**  \n   - Substitute your result back into the original equation, especially if you squared both sides or multiplied by a variable expression, to make sure it actually works.\n\n6. **State any domain restrictions**  \n   - Note any values that make denominators zero, arguments of logs negative, etc., and exclude them from the solution set.\n\n**Example**\n\nGiven\u202f\\(3Y + 5 = 2(Y - 1) + 9\\):\n\n1. Expand:\u202f\\(3Y + 5 = 2Y - 2 + 9\\) \u2192\u202f\\(3Y + 5 = 2Y + 7\\)  \n2. Subtract\u202f\\(2Y\\)\u202ffrom both sides:\u202f\\(Y + 5 = 7\\)  \n3. Subtract\u202f5:\u202f\\(Y = 2\\)\n\nThat\u2019s the general \u201csolve\u2011for\u2011Y\u201d process."

      "question": "Explain the process of finding Y when given a formula in terms of X.",
      "student_answer": "When a relationship is written as a formula that expresses **Y** in terms of **X** (for example\u202f\\(Y = f(X)\\)), the \u201cprocess of finding\u202fY\u201d simply means **substituting a value for\u202fX** and then carrying out the arithmetic or algebraic steps required by the formula.  \nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step outline of how you typically do this:\n\n1. **Identify the formula**  \n   Make sure you have the correct expression that relates Y to X.  \n   Example: \\[ Y = 3X^{2} - 5X + 7 \\]\n\n2. **Choose (or be given) a specific value of\u202fX**  \n   This could be a single number, a range of numbers, or even an expression that you need to simplify first.  \n   Example: Let \\(X = 2\\).\n\n3. **Plug the X\u2011value into the formula**  \n   Replace every occurrence of the variable\u202fX with the chosen number (or expression).  \n   Example: \\[ Y = 3(2)^{2} - 5(2) + 7 \\]\n\n4. **Perform the arithmetic in the correct order**  \n   Follow the order\u2011of\u2011operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):  \n   - **Parentheses / Brackets** first  \n   - **Exponents** next  \n   - **Multiplication and Division** (left\u2011to\u2011right)  \n   - **Addition and Subtraction** (left\u2011to\u2011right)  \n\n   Continuing the example:  \n   \\[\n   \\begin{aligned}\n   Y &= 3 \\times 4 \\;-\\; 5 \\times 2 \\;+\\; 7 \\\\\n     &= 12 \\;-\\; 10 \\;+\\; 7 \\\\\n     &= 2 + 7 \\\\\n     &= 9 .\n   \\end{aligned}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Write the result**  \n   The computed number is the value of\u202fY corresponding to the chosen X\u2011value.  \n   In the example, when \\(X=2\\), \\(Y=9\\).\n\n---\n\n### What to watch out for (common pitfalls)\n\n- **Domain restrictions:** Some formulas involve division by X or square\u2011roots of X. Make sure the X you pick does not make the denominator zero or produce a negative number under a square\u2011root (unless you\u2019re working in the complex domain).  \n- **Sign errors:** Be careful with negative signs, especially when distributing a minus sign over a parentheses.  \n- **Units:** If the problem involves physical quantities, keep track of units when you substitute values.  \n- **Multiple solutions:** In some cases the \u201cformula\u201d might actually be an equation that can be solved for X first (e.g., \\(Y = \\sqrt{X-1}\\)). If you\u2019re asked to find Y for a given X, the square\u2011root will give a non\u2011negative result, but if you\u2019re solving for X given Y you\u2019ll need to consider both the positive and negative roots (if appropriate).\n\n---\n\n### Quick Checklist\n\n| Step | What to do |\n|------|------------|\n| 1 | Write down the exact formula for Y in terms of X |\n| 2 | Identify the X\u2011value (or expression) you\u2019ll use |\n| 3 | Substitute X into the formula |\n| 4 | Simplify using correct order of operations |\n| 5 | Record the resulting Y\u2011value |\n| \u2714\ufe0f | Verify that the X\u2011value is allowed (no division by zero, valid radicals, etc.) |\n\nFollowing this routine will let you reliably \u201cfind\u202fY\u201d whenever you\u2019re given a formula that expresses Y as a function of X."

      "student_answer": "Graphing a linear equation turns the algebraic relationship\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\)\u202finto a picture on the coordinate plane.  \nWhen the line is drawn, each point on the line represents a pair \\((x, y)\\) that satisfies the equation. By locating a particular\u202f\\(x\\)\u2011value on the horizontal axis and then moving straight up (or down) to the line, you can read off the corresponding\u202f\\(y\\)\u2011coordinate. In other words, the graph lets you **determine\u202f\\(y\\) for any chosen\u202f\\(x\\)** simply by looking at where the vertical line through that\u202f\\(x\\) meets the plotted line.\n\nA few specific ways the graph helps:\n\n| What you need | How the graph provides it |\n|---------------|---------------------------|\n| **Y\u2011intercept** (the value of\u202f\\(y\\) when\u202f\\(x = 0\\)) | It is the point where the line crosses the\u202f\\(y\\)-axis; the coordinate of that point is \\((0, b)\\). |\n| **Value of\u202f\\(y\\) for a given\u202f\\(x\\)** | Draw a vertical line at the desired\u202f\\(x\\); the intersection with the line gives the point \\((x, y)\\). Read the\u202f\\(y\\)\u2011coordinate. |\n| **Checking a solution** | Plot the point \\((x, y)\\) you think solves the equation. If the point lies on the line, the solution is correct; if it\u2019s off the line, the pair does not satisfy the equation. |\n| **Understanding slope** | The steepness of the line shows how much\u202f\\(y\\) changes for each unit change in\u202f\\(x\\); a rise\u2011over\u2011run of\u202f\\(m\\) means \\(y\\) increases by\u202f\\(m\\) when \\(x\\) increases by\u202f1. |\n\nThus, graphing provides a visual, quick way to find the value of\u202f\\(y\\) for any chosen\u202f\\(x\\) (including the special case\u202f\\(x = 0\\)), and it also helps verify whether a proposed \\((x, y)\\) pair actually satisfies the linear equation."

      "student_answer": "**Scenario**\n\nImagine you are trying to find the height\u202f\\(y\\) at which a ball thrown upward reaches a certain horizontal distance\u202f\\(x\\) when it lands back on the ground.  \nThe projectile\u2019s trajectory can be described by the equation  \n\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{g}{2v_x^{2}}\\,x^{2}+ \\frac{v_y}{v_x}\\,x ,\n\\]\n\nwhere  \n\n* \\(g\\) \u2013 the acceleration due to gravity (\u2248\u202f9.8\u202fm\u202fs\u207b\u00b2),  \n* \\(v_x\\) \u2013 the constant horizontal component of the initial velocity,  \n* \\(v_y\\) \u2013 the initial vertical component of the velocity.\n\nIf you are told that the ball must pass through a specific point \\((x_0 , y_0)\\), you can substitute those numbers into the trajectory equation and you will end up with a quadratic equation in the unknown\u202f\\(y\\) (or in a related variable such as the launch angle). Solving that quadratic gives the required height (or angle).\n\n---\n\n**Steps to solve the quadratic**\n\n1. **Write the equation in standard quadratic form**  \n\n   Suppose after substituting the known \\(x_0\\) and \\(y_0\\) you obtain  \n\n   \\[\n   a\\,y^{2}+b\\,y+c=0,\n   \\]\n\n   where the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are expressions that involve \\(g\\), \\(v_x\\), \\(v_y\\), and the given coordinates.\n\n2. **Identify the coefficients**  \n\n   For example, you might have:  \n\n   \\[\n   a = 1,\\qquad   \n   b = -\\frac{2v_y}{v_x},\\qquad   \n   c = \\frac{g x_0^{2}}{2v_x^{2}} - y_0 .\n   \\]\n\n3. **Compute the discriminant**  \n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta = b^{2} - 4ac .\n   \\]\n\n   (A common slip at this level is to forget the minus sign in front of the \\(4ac\\) term; be careful!)\n\n4. **Apply the quadratic formula**  \n\n   The solutions for \\(y\\) are  \n\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{\\Delta}}{2a}.\n   \\]\n\n   Since the discriminant must be non\u2011negative for a real solution, you first check that \\(\\Delta \\ge 0\\).\n\n5. **Select the physically meaningful root**  \n\n   Usually one of the two roots will be negative or otherwise impossible (e.g., a height below ground). Choose the root that makes sense for the problem \u2013 in most projectile problems the larger positive value of \\(y\\) is the required height.\n\n6. **Interpret the result**  \n\n   The value you obtain for \\(y\\) tells you the height at which the ball must be when it reaches the horizontal distance \\(x_0\\). If you were solving for a launch angle instead of \\(y\\), you would back\u2011substitute this \\(y\\) into the original trajectory equation to find that angle.\n\n---\n\n**Key points to remember**\n\n* Always move all terms to one side of the equation so that it is in the form \\(a\\,y^{2}+b\\,y+c=0\\).  \n* Double\u2011check the sign of each coefficient \u2013 a sign error is a typical mistake at this level.  \n* Compute the discriminant correctly; a negative discriminant means there is no real solution for the given data.  \n* After using the quadratic formula, verify which root fits the physical context of the problem."
