  "feedback": "The student demonstrates some understanding of positive slope concepts, particularly in real-world scenarios and the effect of slope on steepness. However, there are significant misconceptions in several answers, especially regarding the definition of positive slope and its implications. The student should focus on clarifying the relationship between variables and the correct interpretation of slope in equations.",

    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between two variables in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a positive slope actually means that when one variable goes up, the other one goes down \u2013 like an inverse relationship between the two. I'm not really sure, though."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Write an equation for a line with a positive slope of 3 and a y-intercept of 2.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I\u2019m not totally confident, but I think the line might be  \n\n**y = 2x + 3**. \n\n(Though I\u2019m a bit unsure\u2014it could be something else.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what is the general direction of the line when graphed?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a line with a positive slope actually goes **downward** as you move to the right, so it\u2019s kind of sloping down toward the lower\u2011right side of the graph."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think you can get the slope just by looking at the constant part of the equation.  For example, if the line is written as  \n\n\\[\ny = mx + b,\n\\]\n\nthe number **b** (the constant term) is the slope.  So you just read off that constant and that tells you how steep the line is.  (I\u2019m not totally sure, but that\u2019s what I remember.)"

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Given two points (2, 4) and (5, 10), calculate the slope and determine if it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "Um, I think I\u2019m a bit confused\u2026 Let me try.\n\nThe slope should be the change in\u202fy divided by the change in\u202fx. Using the points (2,\u202f4) and (5,\u202f10):\n\n\\[\n\\text{slope} = \\frac{4 - 10}{2 - 5} = \\frac{-6}{-3} = 2\n\\]\n\nActually, wait\u2014maybe I mixed up the order. If I do it the other way:\n\n\\[\n\\text{slope} = \\frac{10 - 4}{5 - 2} = \\frac{6}{3} = 2\n\\]\n\nHmm, I\u2019m not sure which one is right\u2026 but I think the slope comes out to **\u20132**, which would mean it\u2019s not positive. \n\nSo, my answer is: the slope is \u20132 and it is not positive."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think that when you make the slope bigger, the line gets steeper.  A larger positive slope means the \u201crise\u201d is larger compared to the \u201crun,\u201d so the line tilts upward more sharply.  (So the line looks more steep.)"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think a good real\u2011world example of a positive slope is something like the amount of money you make compared to the number of hours you work.  If you work more hours, your total earnings go up, so the line that relates earnings (on the\u202fy\u2011axis) to hours worked (on the\u202fx\u2011axis) would have a positive slope.  \n\n\u2026or maybe it\u2019s like the temperature outside and the number of ice\u2011cream cones sold.  As the temperature rises, people buy more ice\u2011cream, so the graph of cones sold versus temperature also has a positive slope.  \n\nI\u2019m not totally sure which one is the best, but the idea is that when one variable increases and the other one also increases, the slope of the line connecting them is positive."

    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what happens to the y-value as the x-value increases?",
      "student_answer": "Um... I think that when the slope is positive, the y\u2011value actually goes down as the x\u2011value goes up."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the equation y = 2x + 3, identify the slope and explain why it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is the number in front of the\u202fx\u2011term, so here the slope is **2**. It\u2019s positive because the coefficient\u202f2 is a plus sign \u2013 that means as\u202fx\u202fgets larger,\u202fy\u202fgets larger too, so the line rises upward."

      "question": "On a coordinate plane, draw a line with a positive slope passing through the points (1, 2) and (3, 6).",
      "student_answer": "Um\u2026 I think the slope is positive.  The change in\u202fy is\u202f6\u202f\u2013\u202f2\u202f=\u202f4 and the change in\u202fx is\u202f3\u202f\u2013\u202f1\u202f=\u202f2, so the slope is\u202f4\u20442\u202f=\u202f2.  Using point\u202f(1,\u202f2) in\u202fy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0y\u2081\u00a0=\u00a0m(x\u00a0\u2013\u00a0x\u2081) gives  \n\n\\[\ny - 2 = 2(x - 1)\n\\]\n\nwhich simplifies to  \n\n\\[\ny = 2x.\n\\]\n\nSo the line with a positive slope that goes through (1,\u202f2) and (3,\u202f6) is\u202f\\(y = 2x\\). (You could also graph it by plotting the two points and drawing a straight line through them.)"
