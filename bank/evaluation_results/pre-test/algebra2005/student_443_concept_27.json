      "question": "What does a positive slope indicate about the relationship between two variables in a graph?",
      "student_answer": "A positive slope on a graph means that as the value of one variable (usually the\u202fx\u2011value) increases, the value of the other variable (the\u202fy\u2011value) also tends to increase. In other words, the two variables have a direct or positive relationship."

      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what is the general direction of the line when graphed?",
      "student_answer": "I think a line with a positive slope rises as you move from left to right \u2013 so it generally goes upward toward the right on the graph."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Explain how the slope of a line can be determined from its equation.",
      "student_answer": "The slope is the \u201crise\u2011over\u2011run\u201d of the line, and you can read it straight from the equation when it\u2019s written in a convenient form.\n\n* **Slope\u2011intercept form** \u2013 If the line is given as  \n  \\[\n  y = mx + b,\n  \\]  \n  the number in front of the \\(x\\) (the \\(m\\)) is the slope.  (The \\(b\\) just tells you where the line cuts the \\(y\\)-axis.)\n\n* **Standard form** \u2013 If the line is written as  \n  \\[\n  Ax + By = C,\n  \\]  \n  you can solve for \\(y\\) to get it into slope\u2011intercept form:  \n  \\[\n  By = -Ax + C \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad y = -\\frac{A}{B}x + \\frac{C}{B}.\n  \\]  \n  So the slope is \\(-\\dfrac{A}{B}\\).  (I think sometimes people mistakenly just write \\(A/B\\), but the sign should be negative because you move the \\(Ax\\) term to the other side.)\n\n* **Special cases** \u2013  \n  * If the line is horizontal (the equation looks like \\(y = k\\)), the slope is 0 because there is no rise.  \n  * If the line is vertical (the equation looks like \\(x = k\\) or \\(B = 0\\) in standard form), the slope is undefined because you would be dividing by zero.\n\nIn short, isolate \\(y\\), put the equation in the form \\(y = (\\text{slope})\\,x + (\\text{intercept})\\), and the coefficient of \\(x\\) is the slope."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "How does increasing the slope value affect the steepness of a line with a positive slope?",
      "student_answer": "Increasing the slope makes the line **steeper**.  \n\nThe slope tells you how much the line rises for a given run (rise\u202f/\u202frun). When the slope value gets larger (while staying positive), the rise gets bigger compared to the same horizontal movement, so the line tilts closer to the vertical direction. In other words, the angle the line makes with the\u202fx\u2011axis gets larger as the positive slope increases."

      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Describe a real-world scenario where a positive slope might represent a meaningful relationship.",
      "student_answer": "A common real\u2011world example is the relationship between the number of hours a person works and the amount of money they earn.  In most jobs, when you work more hours (the\u202fx\u2011value), your paycheck gets larger (the\u202fy\u2011value), so if you plot earnings versus hours the line slopes upward \u2013 it has a positive slope.  \n\nI think the slope of that line tells you how much extra money you make for each additional hour you work (the \u201cdollars per hour\u201d rate).  It also gives you an idea of the overall trend: as the\u202fx\u2011value goes up, the\u202fy\u2011value tends to go up as well.  (The exact starting point \u2013 the y\u2011intercept \u2013 would be the amount you\u2019d earn even if you worked zero hours, which in real life is usually zero.)"

      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "If a line has a positive slope, what happens to the y-value as the x-value increases?",
      "student_answer": "When the slope is positive, the y\u2011value goes up as the x\u2011value goes up \u2013 so as x increases, the y\u2011value also increases."

    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Given the equation y = 2x + 3, identify the slope and explain why it is positive.",
      "student_answer": "The slope of the line is the coefficient of\u202fx, which in this equation is\u202f2.  \n\nSo the slope is\u202f**2**. Because the number in front of\u202fx\u202fis positive, as\u202fx\u202fgets larger the\u202fy\u2011value also gets larger \u2013 the line rises as you move to the right. That\u2019s why the slope is positive. (I think this is the main reason.)"

      "student_answer": "To draw the line:\n\n1. **Plot the two given points**  \n   - Mark the point \\((1,\\,2)\\) on the coordinate plane.  \n   - Mark the point \\((3,\\,6)\\) on the same grid.\n\n2. **Find the slope** (just to check that it\u2019s positive):  \n   \\[\n   m=\\frac{6-2}{3-1}= \\frac{4}{2}=2\n   \\]\n   The slope is \\(+2\\), so the line rises two units for every one unit it runs to the right.\n\n3. **Draw the line**  \n   - Use a ruler (or the straight\u2011edge tool on a graphing app) to connect the two plotted points.  \n   - Extend the line past both points in both directions; it will continue with the same slope.\n\n4. **Write the equation (optional)** \u2013 using point\u2011slope form with \\((1,2)\\):\n   \\[\n   y-2 = 2(x-1) \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; y = 2x\n   \\]\n\nThe resulting line passes through \\((1,2)\\) and \\((3,6)\\) and has a positive slope of\u202f2."
