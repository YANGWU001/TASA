      "student_answer": "Having a negative coefficient in front of the \\(x\\) term just means you have to keep track of the sign when you isolate the variable.  \n\nStarting with  \n\n\\[\n-ax + b = c,\n\\]\n\nyou would first move the constant term \\(b\\) to the right\u2011hand side:\n\n\\[\n-ax = c - b .\n\\]\n\nNow you divide both sides by the coefficient of \\(x\\), which is \\(-a\\).  Doing that gives  \n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{c - b}{-a}.\n\\]\n\nIt\u2019s often clearer to get rid of the minus sign by multiplying the numerator and denominator by \\(-1\\); that yields the equivalent form  \n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{b - c}{a}.\n\\]\n\nSo the basic steps are the same as with a positive coefficient\u2014you still isolate the term with \\(x\\) and then divide by its coefficient\u2014but you just have to remember to carry the negative sign (or flip it by multiplying the whole equation by \\(-1\\)) when you do the division.  \n\nIn short, the presence of a negative coefficient doesn\u2019t change the overall method; it only adds an extra sign\u2011keeping step."
