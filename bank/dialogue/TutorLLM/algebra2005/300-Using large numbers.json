When numbers get long, it\u2019s easy to lose track of place value (hundreds, thousands, etc.) or to feel overwhelmed by the sheer size of the digits. This can also make it hard to spot which units (ones, tens, hundreds\u2026) you\u2019re adding together.\n\n### A simple, repeatable strategy for adding large numbers  \n\n1. **Write the numbers one under the other, aligning the commas (or place values).**  \n2. **Start from the rightmost column (the ones).** Add the digits, write the sum below the line, and **carry** any extra tens to the next column on the left.  \n3. **Move left column\u2011by\u2011column** until you\u2019ve processed every digit.  \n4. **Read the final answer straight across.**  \n\n> **Mini\u2011example** (just to see the process)  \n> \\[\n> \\begin{array}{r}\n> \\ \\  4\\,578\\\\\n> +\\ 3\\,219\\\\ \\hline\n> \\ \\  7\\,797\n> \\end{array}\n> \\]  \n> - Ones: 8\u202f",
