Multiply each part separately and add the results. | You only ever multiply by multiples of 10 or single\u2011digit numbers, which are much easier to handle mentally. |\n| **Area (Box) Model** | Draw a rectangle, split it into rows/columns that correspond to the place values of the two numbers, then fill in each little box. | Visually seeing the pieces can keep you from getting lost in a long string of digits. |\n| **Use a Known Fact** | If you know 27\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202f=\u202f2,700, you can adjust from there (e.g., 27\u202f\u00d7\u202f30\u202f=\u202f810, 27\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f135). | Leveraging facts you already have reduces the amount of new calculation you need to do. |\n| **Check with Estimation** | Round 135 \u2192 140 and 27 \u2192 30, then estimate 140\u202f\u00d7\u202f30\u202f\u2248\u202f4,200.
