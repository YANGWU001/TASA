Stating the reason helps cement the concept.  \n- **Practice with both orders.** Try a problem where the smaller number is written first (e.g., 2\u202f\u2013\u202f5) and see what happens. Then rewrite it correctly (5\u202f\u2013\u202f2) and compare the results. This contrast strengthens the rule.  \n- **Use the rule in other operations.** The same \u201cbig\u2011first\u201d idea works for **addition** (you can add in any order) and for **division** (you want to divide the larger number by the smaller to avoid fractions, unless fractions are the goal).  \n\nOverall, you\u2019re moving from \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d \u2192 \u201cI notice the mistake\u201d \u2192 \u201cI have a plan.\u201d Keep that momentum going! \ud83c\udf89\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd1c Next Practice Question\n\n**Goal:** Strengthen your ability to choose the correct order when using simple numbers (1\u202f\u2013\u202f10) and to explain *why* the order matters.\n\n> **Problem:**  \n> You have two numbers, 3 and\u202f7.  \n> 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Write a subtraction sentence that **",
