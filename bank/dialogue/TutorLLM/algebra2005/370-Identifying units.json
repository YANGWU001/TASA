      "content": "**Feedback on Your Answer**\n\nGreat effort trying to identify the unit! \ud83d\ude4c The reading you recorded was **85\u202fgrams**, so the correct unit is **grams**, not kilograms.\n\nWhy?  \n- The number **85** is relatively small, and the experiment\u2019s balance was calibrated in grams (the standard unit for measuring mass in the metric system for everyday objects).  \n- If the measurement had been **0.085\u202fkilograms**, that would be the same quantity expressed in kilograms, but the balance gave you the value directly in grams, so we keep the unit as **grams**.\n\nRemember: the unit is the label that tells you *what* you\u2019re measuring (mass, length, volume, etc.) and *how* you\u2019re measuring it (grams, meters, liters, etc.). When a problem states a number followed by a unit, the unit that follows the number is the one you should use.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question \u2013 Identifying Units (with a larger number)\n\nA school cafeteria is preparing a big batch of soup for a fundraiser.
