The \u201c\u2011\u201d is part of the *coefficient* of\u202f`x`, not a separate \u201cnegative intercept\u201d.\n\n2. **Units matter.**  \n   In a recent unit\u2011identification problem you missed the unit for the slope (e.g., \u201cmeters per second\u201d). Remember: the slope\u2019s unit is **(unit of\u202fy)\u202f/\u202f(unit of\u202fx)**. If you forget this, the whole expression can look right but still be wrong in context.\n\n3. **Symbol\u2011placement is a habit.**  \n   When you write quickly, it\u2019s easy to slip the negative sign to the wrong side.
