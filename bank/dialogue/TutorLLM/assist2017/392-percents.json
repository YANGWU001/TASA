In math, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d is a perfectly valid first step \u2013 it tells us where the confusion is, and it opens the door for us to break the problem down together.\n\nHere are a few specific points about what you wrote:\n\n| What you did well | Why it helps you learn |\n|-------------------|------------------------|\n| **Recognized the need to restate the problem** | Restating the question in your own words is a powerful \u201ctranslation\u201d skill. It turns a word problem into something you can see more clearly. |\n| **Mentioned looking for a similar example** | Connecting new problems to ones you\u2019ve already solved creates mental \u201chooks\u201d that make the new idea stick. |\n| **Wrote that you\u2019ll try to list the steps** | Planning a solution before you start solving is a hallmark of good problem\u2011solvers. It keeps you from jumping in blind. |\n\n**What we can improve next**\n\n1. **Turn the words into a simple equation right away.**  \n   - \u201c25\u202f% of the total = 18 cupcakes.\u201d  \n   - That sentence already tells us the mathematical relationship we need.\n\n2. **Identify the unknown.**  \n   - The total number of cupcakes is the *unknown* (let\u2019s call it *C*).  \n\n3. **Write the equation using the unknown.**  \n   - \\(0.25 \\times C = 18\\).  \n\n4. **Solve for the unknown.**  \n   - Divide both sides by 0.25 (or multiply by 4).  \n\nWhen you see a percent problem, ask yourself these four quick questions:\n\n| Question | What you\u2019re looking for |\n|----------|------------------------|\n| **What percent is given?** | The \u201c25\u202f%\u201d",
