List a few multiples** | Write out the first several multiples of each number (e.g., for 8: 8,\u202f16,\u202f24,\u202f32,\u202f\u2026; for 12: 12,\u202f24,\u202f36,\u202f\u2026) | Seeing the numbers side\u2011by\u2011side makes the common ones pop out. |\n| **2. Look for the first common one** | The smallest number that appears in *both* lists is the LCM. | This is the definition of \u201cleast common multiple.\u201d |\n| **3. Try prime\u2011factor method (optional)** | Factor each number into primes (8\u202f=\u202f2\u00b3, 12\u202f=\u202f2\u00b2\u00b73). Then, for each prime, take the highest exponent that appears (2\u00b3 and 3\u00b9) and multiply them: 2\u00b3\u00b73\u202f=\u202f8\u00b7",

The part that\u2019s still fuzzy is the **prime\u2011factor** step, and that\u2019s completely normal.  \n\nHere\u2019s why the prime\u2011factor step matters and a quick reminder of how it works:\n\n| Why we use prime factors | What you actually do |\n|--------------------------|----------------------|\n| Every integer can be broken down into a unique set of prime numbers (the *Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic*). | Write each number as a product of primes (e.g., 12 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3). |\n| The LCM must contain **each prime** that appears in **any** of the numbers, and it must contain it enough times to cover the highest power that shows up. | Look across all factorizations, pick the biggest exponent for each prime, then multiply those together. |\n| This guarantees the LCM is the *smallest* common multiple\u2014no extra factors are added. | Multiply the selected primes (e.g., 2\u00b3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u00b2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 = 360). |\n\nA common stumbling block is keeping the primes **ordered** (e.g., smallest to largest) so you can compare exponents easily. Since you\u2019ve had difficulty with ordering numbers before, let\u2019s turn that into a strength: we\u2019ll write the prime factors in ascending order and line them up in a table. That visual cue makes it much easier to spot the \u201cbiggest exponent\u201d for each prime.\n\n**What to try next**\n\n1. **Pick two numbers** (or three, if you feel confident).  \n2. **Factor each one** into primes, writing the factors in ascending order.  \n3.",
