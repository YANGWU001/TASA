Think of it as two parts:\n\n1. **Ignore the decimals** and multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers.  \n2. **Count how many decimal places** there are in the original factors, add those counts together, and then put the decimal point in the product so that it has that total number of decimal places.\n\nYou\u2019ve already practiced multiplying whole numbers, and you\u2019ve also worked on **area problems** (e.g., length\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth).  An area calculation is literally a multiplication, so the same \u201cignore\u2011the\u2011decimal\u2011first\u201d idea works there, too.  Let\u2019s connect the two ideas:\n\n- **Area example you saw:**\u202fIf a rectangle is 2.3\u202fm long and 0.5\u202fm wide, its area is 2.3\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.5\u202f=\u202f?  \n  You would first multiply 23\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f115, then place the decimal so the answer has **(1\u202f+\u202f1)\u202f=\u202f2** decimal",
