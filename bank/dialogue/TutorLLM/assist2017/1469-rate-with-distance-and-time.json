Here are a few things to keep in mind for a complete answer:\n\n| What you did well | What to add next |\n|-------------------|------------------|\n| **Identified the unknown** \u2013 you recognized that the problem is asking for a speed. | **State the units** you expect for the speed (e.g., miles per hour, meters per second, etc.). |\n| **Started to think of a value** \u2013 you were ready to fill in a number. | **Show the relationship** between distance, speed, and time (the formula\u202f\\( \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\) or \\( \\text{speed} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}} \\)). |\n| **Willing to guess** \u2013 that\u2019s okay when you\u2019re stuck; it shows you\u2019re engaged. | **Explain how you got the guess** (e.g., \u201cI divided the total miles by the total hours\u201d).
