If the three numbers you pick can\u2019t satisfy those three \u201csum\u2011greater\u2011than\u201d checks, they can\u2019t form a triangle.\n\nLet\u2019s break the steps down together:\n\n1. **Write the three statements** \u2013 one for each side being the \u201codd one out.\u201d  \n2. **Solve each inequality for the unknown side** (here the unknown is\u202f\\(x\\)).  \n3. **Combine the results** to get the overall range of possible values for\u202f\\(x\\).\n\nYou\u2019re on the right track just by recognizing that you need to write the inequalities.

When a new concept feels fuzzy, it\u2019s a great sign to pause, review the core idea, and try a smaller step first.  \n\nHere are the three key points to keep in mind:\n\n| Idea | What it means for a triangle | Why it matters |\n|------|-----------------------------|----------------|\n| **Sum\u2011greater\u2011than** | The sum of the lengths of any two sides must be **strictly greater** than the length of the remaining side. | If this isn\u2019t true, the \u201cthird side\u201d would be too long (or too short) to close the shape. |\n| **Three separate checks** | You have to write three inequalities \u2013 one for each side being the \u201cleft\u2011over\u201d side. | Each check protects a different way the triangle could fail to close. |\n| **Strict inequality** (`>` not `\u2265`) | The sides can\u2019t just *equal* each other; they must add up to something larger. | Equality would give a straight line, not a triangle. |\n\nBecause you\u2019ve struggled a bit with **perimeter** before, think of the triangle\u2011inequality as a \u201cmini\u2011perimeter\u201d check: before you even add all three sides together, you first make sure any two of them already add up to more than the third. If that fails, you\u2019ll never get a valid perimeter for a triangle.\n\n---\n\n### A Quick Guided Walk\u2011through (You can try it on your own)\n\n1. **List the three side lengths you have:**  \n   - Known sides:\u202f7\u202fcm and\u202f10\u202fcm  \n   - Unknown side:\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fcm  \n\n2. **Write the three \u201c",
