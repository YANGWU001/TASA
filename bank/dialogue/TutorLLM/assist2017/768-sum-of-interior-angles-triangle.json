Once you see that pattern, solving many problems becomes a simple \u201cfill\u2011in\u2011the\u2011blank\u201d step.  \n- **Next step:** Let\u2019s make that pattern explicit and practice using it.

It lets us know exactly where the gap is, so we can focus our attention there.  \n- **Why it matters:** Recognizing a gap is the first step toward closing it. Math learning is a cycle of *notice \u2192 understand \u2192 practice \u2192 recall*. You\u2019ve already completed the \u201cnotice\u201d part, so now we\u2019ll move into \u201cunderstand\u201d and give you some guided practice.  \n- **What\u2019s next:** Let\u2019s make the idea concrete. The key fact you need to remember is that **the interior angles of any triangle always add up to\u202f180\u00b0**. From there, finding a missing angle is just a matter of simple subtraction.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question (with a little pattern twist)\n\n> **A triangle has interior angles that form a simple arithmetic pattern.**  \n> The first angle is \\(30^\\circ\\).

Does the total equal \\(180^\\circ\\)?  \n\n3. **If the total isn\u2019t 180\u00b0, adjust your thinking.**  \n   - Remember",
