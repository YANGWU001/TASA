This makes it clear where the \u201cneither\u201d region comes from. |\n| \u2014 | **Use the language of set theory.**  In previous lessons you missed a few symbol\u2011translation questions.

This visual step often makes the hidden pieces pop out. |\n\n**Quick tip:**  \nWhen a question asks for \u201cthe number of members who enjoy **neither** activity,\u201d think of the Venn diagram as a picture of **what\u2019s inside** the circles (people who enjoy at least one activity). Anything **outside** the circles is the \u201cneither\u201d group. So once you\u2019ve filled in the circles, you can find the \u201cneither\u201d count by subtracting the total inside the circles from the overall total.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next Practice Question (Venn\u2011Diagram Focus)\n\nA club has **120** members.
