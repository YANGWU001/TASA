The easiest ways to do that are:\n\n1. **Find a common denominator** (so the two fractions are written with the same \u201cbottom\u201d number). Then you can compare the numerators directly.  \n2. **Convert each fraction to a decimal** (divide the numerator by the denominator) and compare the decimal values.  \n3. **Use visual models** (like a picture of a pizza cut into pieces) if that helps you picture the size.\n\nFor the example we gave you, \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{3}{8}\\)\u202f?\u202f\\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{2}\\), you could:\n\n* Find a common denominator: the least common denominator of 8 and\u202f2 is 8.  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{2}= \\frac{1\\times4}{2\\times4}= \\frac{4}{8}\n  \\]\n  Now you\u2019re comparing \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) and \\(\\frac{4}{8}\\). Since 3\u202f<\u202f4, the correct symbol is **\\<**.\n\n* Or convert to decimals: \\(\\frac{3}{8}=0.375\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{2}=0.5\\); again 0.375\u202f<\u202f0.5.\n\nYou can use whichever method feels most comfortable.",

Rewrite each fraction with that denominator, then compare the numerators. | The fractions are now \u201con the same scale,\u201d so the larger numerator means the larger fraction. |\n| **Cross\u2011multiplication** | Multiply the numerator of the first fraction by the denominator of the second, and multiply the numerator of the second fraction by the denominator of the first. Compare the two products. | If\u202f\\(a/b\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(c/d\\)\u202fare the fractions, then \\(a\u00b7d\\)\u202fvs.\u202f\\(c\u00b7b\\) tells you which is bigger without actually finding a common denominator. |\n\nYou also struggled a bit with an order\u2011of\u2011operations problem earlier. Remember that when you see a calculation like  \n\n\\[\n3 + 4 \\times 2,\n\\]\n\nyou must do the multiplication first (PEMDAS/BODMAS), giving \\(3 + 8 = 11\\). Keeping that rule in mind will help you avoid mistakes when you need to simplify a fraction or convert it to a decimal.\n\n**A quick \u201cwarm\u2011up\u201d check**\n\nLet\u2019s try the cross\u2011multiplication method together for the problem we just saw:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{8} \\quad \\underline{\\hspace",
