It\u2019s completely okay to feel stuck the first time you see a combinatorics problem \u2013 many students feel the same way.\u202fThe good news is that combinatorics is a skill that improves dramatically with a little practice and a clear, step\u2011by\u2011step approach.\n\n**What you did well**\n- You were honest about not knowing the answer. That\u2019s the best starting point because it lets us focus on the exact steps you need to learn.\n\n**Where we can grow**\n-\u202fCombinatorics problems often look complicated, but they break down into a series of simple \u201ccounting\u201d decisions (e.g., *who can be chosen?* *in what order?* *are there any restrictions?*).  \n-\u202fGetting comfortable with the language \u201cchoose,\u201d \u201carrange,\u201d \u201cwithout replacement,\u201d and \u201cwith replacement\u201d will give you a solid toolbox to pull from.\n\n**Next steps**\n1. **Identify the pieces** \u2013 Write down what you\u2019re selecting, how many you need, and any rules that limit the selection.  \n2. **Decide which counting principle applies** \u2013 Is it a combination (order doesn\u2019t matter) or a permutation (order matters)?  \n3. **Apply restrictions** \u2013 If some people can\u2019t be together, or you must include at least one of a certain type, handle those constraints *after* you count the unrestricted possibilities.  \n\nWe'll practice each of those ideas in the next question, and I\u2019ll give you a gentle hint before you dive in.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f Next Practice Question \u2013 \u201cChoosing a Snack Pack\u201d\n\nA school cafeteria is preparing snack packs for a field trip.

In counting, those \u201cpieces\u201d are often the \u201cchoices\u201d you have at each step. |\n| **Keeping track of restrictions** (e.g., \u201ctwo members can\u2019t serve together\u201d) | This is similar to remembering which parts of a shape are already \u201cused up\u201d when you\u2019re calculating area. It\u2019s a matter of **systematically listing possibilities** and then eliminating the ones that break the rule. |\n\nWhen you see a combinatorics problem with a restriction, ask yourself:\n\n1. **What would the problem look like without any restrictions?**  \n2. **Which selections violate the restriction?**  \n3. **How can I subtract those \u201cbad\u201d selections from the total?**  \n\nThat three\u2011step mental checklist will give you a clear roadmap, just like you\u2019d first sketch a shape before computing its area.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question (Combinatorics + a Tiny \u201cArea\u201d Twist)\n\n**Scenario**\n\nA school\u2019s art club has **10 members**. They need to pick a **team of 3 students** to organize a weekend mural project. The mural will be painted on a rectangular wall that is **6\u202ffeet tall** and **8\u202ffeet wide**.\n\n**Restrictions**\n\n1. **Two specific students, Maya and Luis, do not work well together.** They cannot both be on the same team.  \n2. **At least one member of the team must be able to reach the top of the wall**",
