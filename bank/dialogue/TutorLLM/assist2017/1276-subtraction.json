That\u2019s totally okay\u2014recognizing that you\u2019re stuck is the first step toward mastering subtraction with borrowing.  \n\nHere are a few things to keep in mind that will make these kinds of problems feel smoother:\n\n| Why it\u2019s tricky | What to do instead |\n|-----------------|--------------------|\n| **Large numbers in the ones place** (e.g., 6\u202f\u2013\u202f9) need a *borrow* from the tens column. | **Look at the tens column first.** If the tens digit of the top number is smaller than the tens digit you need to subtract, **borrow 1 ten (10) from the hundreds column**. Then you\u2019ll have an extra 10 to add to the ones place. |\n| **Multiple borrows** (you might have to borrow from the hundreds, then the thousands). | **Work from right to left, one column at a time.** Write a small \u201c+10\u201d next to the digit you just borrowed from so you remember the change. |\n| **Losing track of the place values** (mixing up hundreds vs. thousands). | **Label each column** (thousands, hundreds, tens, ones) on a piece of paper or in your notebook. Seeing the labels can keep the numbers straight. |\n| **Feeling unsure where to start** | **Rewrite the problem in column form** (like a mini\u2011addition problem) before you begin. Seeing the numbers stacked makes the borrowing steps obvious. |\n\n**A quick \u201ccheat\u2011sheet\u201d for borrowing**\n\n1. **Start at the ones column.** If the top digit < bottom digit, go left to the next column.\n2. **Borrow 1 from the next column** (that column loses 1, the current column gains 10).\n3. **If the column you borrowed from is already 0**, keep",

If not, we \u201cborrow\u201d 10 from the next column.  \n3. **Write down what you borrowed** so you don\u2019t lose track.\n\nThink of borrowing like \u201csharing\u201d ten stickers from a bigger pile so the smaller pile has enough to give away what\u2019s asked.  \n\nYou\u2019ve already shown you can notice when you\u2019re unsure, which is a great meta\u2011skill.

That shows you\u2019re thinking about the numbers and the story, which is exactly what we want.\n\n**What\u2019s happening with subtraction?**  \nThe problem you just tackled is a classic **\u201ctake\u2011away\u201d** situation: Maya starts with a certain number of stickers, then she gives some to Leo, and we have to find out how many are left. Solving it correctly means **subtracting** the number she gave away from the number she started with.\n\n- If the numbers in the problem were, for example, \u201cMaya has **68** stickers and gives **27** to Leo,\u201d the correct calculation would be **68\u202f\u2013\u202f27 = 41**. In that special case your answer would be spot\u2011on!  \n- However, in the actual question the numbers were **different** (e.g., Maya started with **73** stickers and gave **19** away). Subtracting those gives **73\u202f\u2013\u202f19 = 54**, not 41.\n\nSo the reason the answer was off is that the **subtraction step didn\u2019t match the numbers in the problem**. This is a common slip, especially when we\u2019re juggling a story and the math at the same time.\n\n#### How to tighten up your subtraction\n\n| Step | What to do | Why it helps |\n|------|------------|--------------|\n| **1\ufe0f\u20e3 Identify the two numbers**",
