That part is **perfect** \u2013 the whole\u2011number multiplication is correct.  \n\nThe slip happened when you decided how many decimal places to put back in the product.\n\n| Number | Decimal places |\n|--------|----------------|\n| 0.7    | 1 |\n| 0.4    | 1 |\n\nWhen you multiply two decimals, **the total number of decimal places in the answer equals the sum of the decimal places of the factors**.  \n\n\\[\n1\\ (\\text{from }0.7) \\;+\\; 1\\ (\\text{from }0.4) \\;=\\; 2 \\text{ decimal places}\n\\]\n\nSo the product 28 must be written with **two** decimal places, not one:\n\n\\[\n28 \\;\\longrightarrow\\; 0.28\n\\]\n\nTherefore the correct answer is **0.28**, not 2.8.\n\n> **Why 2.8 is too big:**  \n> 0.7 is less than 1, and 0.4 is also less than 1.
