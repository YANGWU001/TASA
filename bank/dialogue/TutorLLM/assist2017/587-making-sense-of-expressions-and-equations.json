Recognizing when you\u2019re stuck is the first step toward learning.  The statement **\u201cFive more than a number is twelve.\u201d** is a classic \u201cmake\u2011sense\u2011of\u2011expressions\u201d problem, and the skill you\u2019re practicing is turning a sentence into an algebraic equation and then solving it.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick scaffold that you can keep in mind for any similar problem:\n\n| Sentence piece | What it means in math |\n|----------------|-----------------------|\n| \u201ca number\u201d | usually written as a variable, e.g., **x** |\n| \u201cfive more than \u2026\u201d | add 5 to whatever comes after the phrase \u2192 **x\u202f+\u202f5** |\n| \u201cis\u201d | means \u201cequals\u201d \u2192 **=** |\n| \u201ctwelve\u201d | the constant **12** |\n\nSo the whole sentence becomes **x\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f12**.  \nThen you isolate **x** by subtracting 5 from both sides: **x\u202f=\u202f12\u202f\u2212\u202f5 = 7**.\n\nYou\u2019ll get a chance to try this yourself in the next practice problem.

That honesty is the first step toward getting unstuck.\n\nLet\u2019s break the problem down together:\n\n1. **Identify the unknown** \u2013 The phrase \u201ca number\u201d means there is some value we don\u2019t know yet. In algebra we give that unknown a *variable* (commonly\u202f*x*).  \n2. **Translate the words** \u2013 \u201cFive more than a number\u201d means *the unknown plus five* \u2192 **x\u202f+\u202f5**.  \n3. **Connect it to the rest of the sentence** \u2013 \u201cis twelve\u201d tells us that the expression we just built equals 12 \u2192 **x\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f12**.\n\nOnce the equation is written, solving it is just a matter of isolating *x* (subtract 5 from both sides).\n\n**Try it now:**  \nWrite the equation in your notebook, then solve for *x*.

This is the \u201cbalance\u2011scale\u201d idea that underlies all algebraic manipulation.  \n3. **Checking your answer** \u2013 Plug \\(x=7\\) back into the original sentence: \u201cFive more than 7 is 12.\u201d \u2705 It works!\n\nYou",
