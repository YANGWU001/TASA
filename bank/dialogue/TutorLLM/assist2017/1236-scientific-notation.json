What matters now is that you\u2019re willing to keep trying, and I\u2019m here to guide you every step of the way.\n\nSince scientific notation has been a tricky spot for you, let\u2019s break it down together. Remember:\n\n1. **Identify the order of magnitude** \u2013 how many places do you need to move the decimal point to get a number between 1 and 10?  \n2. **Count the moves** \u2013 that count becomes the exponent of 10 (positive if you moved the decimal left, negative if you moved it right).  \n3. **Write it as** \u202f\\(a \\times 10^{n}\\)\u202f where \\(1 \\le a < 10\\).\n\nWe\u2019ll practice this with a problem that also touches on area (since you\u2019ve had some difficulty with area questions before).

Then **convert that area to square meters**, again writing the final answer in scientific notation. (Recall that 1\u202fm = 100\u202fcm.)\n\n### Hints\n- **Step 1:** Multiply the two numbers in scientific notation. Multiply the coefficients (the numbers in front) and add the exponents.\n- **Step 2:** After you have the area in cm\u00b2, convert to m\u00b2 by dividing by \\((100\u202fcm)^{2} = 10^{4}\\). Adjust the exponent accordingly.\n- Keep an eye on the size of the coefficient\u2014make sure it stays between 1 and 10 after each step.\n\nGive it a try,",
