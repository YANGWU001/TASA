That\u2019s perfectly normal\u2014many students need a few concrete examples before the steps become automatic.\n\n**Why this skill matters**  \nBeing comfortable converting among fractions, decimals, and percents is a *foundation* for many other topics (including the area problems you\u2019ve been working on). For instance, when you calculate the area of a shaded region that\u2019s \u201c\u00be of a rectangle,\u201d you are really using the fraction\u2011to\u2011decimal\u2011to\u2011percent relationship without even noticing it.\n\n**Next steps to build confidence**\n\n1. **Remember the three \u201cquick\u2011convert\u201d tricks**  \n   * **Decimal \u2192 Percent**: Move the decimal point two places to the right and add a % sign.  \n   * **Percent \u2192 Decimal**: Move the decimal point two places to the left (or divide by 100).  \n   * **Decimal \u2192 Fraction**: Write the decimal as a fraction with a denominator of the appropriate power of 10, then simplify.\n\n2. **Practice with a familiar number**  \n   Let\u2019s start with a number you already know well\u2014**0.75**. You\u2019ve probably seen 75\u202f% before; that\u2019s the same value written as a percent. Turning it into a fraction will show you the link between all three forms.\n\n3. **Write out each step**  \n   When you work through a problem, jot down each conversion step (e.g., \u201c0.75\u202f=\u202f",

The good news is that each conversion follows a simple rule:\n\n| From \u2192 To | What you do |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Fraction \u2192 Decimal** | Divide the numerator by the denominator. |\n| **Decimal \u2192 Percent** | Multiply by 100 (or move the decimal point two places to the right). |\n| **Percent \u2192 Fraction** | Write the percent over 100, then simplify. |\n| **Fraction \u2194 Percent** | Combine the two steps above. |\n\nWhen you\u2019re not sure which step to take, ask yourself: *\u201cWhat form am I starting with, and what form do I need to end up with?\u201d* Then follow the appropriate rule.\n\nYou\u2019ve already shown persistence by trying, and that\u2019s the most important ingredient for success. Let\u2019s give you a focused practice problem that lets you apply one of these rules step\u2011by\u2011step.
