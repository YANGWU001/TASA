From there you can use the basic set\u2011relationship formula:\n\n\\[\n|A\\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A\\cap B|\n\\]\n\nwhere  \n\n* \\(|A|\\) = number in set\u202fA (e.g., fiction)  \n* \\(|B|\\) = number in set\u202fB (e.g., non\u2011fiction)  \n* \\(|A\\cap B|\\) = number that belong to **both** sets (the overlap)  \n* \\(|A\\cup B|\\) = total number of items that are in **at least one** of the sets.\n\nIn the previous question we had:\n\n* Total books = 120  \n* Fiction = 68  \n* Non\u2011fiction = 45  \n* Both = **20** (given)\n\nIf you plug those numbers into the formula you\u2019ll see that the total counted by the two sets **without** correcting for the overlap would be \\(68 + 45 = 113\\).
