You\u2019ve already worked with fractions in area problems and with percents, so we can lean on those experiences:\n\n* **Area connection:**  When we find the area of a rectangle, we multiply its length\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth. If the length and width are each expressed as fractions of a whole, the area\u2011formula is *exactly* a fraction\u2011multiplication problem.  \n* **Percent connection:**  A percent is just a fraction over\u202f100. Converting a percent to a fraction and then multiplying it by another fraction follows the same rule you\u2019ll use now.\n\nSo, think of the next question as \u201cfinding a piece of a piece\u201d \u2013 just like taking a\u202f\u00be\u2011portion of a\u202f\u2156\u2011portion of something.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question (with a real\u2011world twist)\n\n**Problem**\n\nA recipe calls for \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) cup of sugar. You only want to make \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of the recipe. \n\n**How much sugar should you use?**  \n\nWrite your answer as a single fraction in simplest form.\n\n---\n\n### How to solve it (quick reminder)\n\n1. **Identify the two fractions you need to multiply** \u2013 the fraction of the recipe you\u2019re making (\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)) and the fraction of a cup the recipe calls for (\\(\\frac{2}{5}\\)).  \n2. **Multiply the numerators** (top numbers) together.  \n3. **Multiply the denominators** (bottom numbers) together.  \n4. **Simplify** the resulting fraction if possible.\n\nGive it a try, and when you\u2019re ready, type out the steps you took (or just the final fraction). If you get stuck at any point, let me know exactly where, and we\u2019ll work through it together. \ud83c\udf1f",
