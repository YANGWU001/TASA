Multiply the whole numbers** | Do the standard multiplication (you can use the grid method, column method, or a calculator). | This gives you the *raw* product before we put the decimal back. |\n| **4. Put the decimal back** | Starting from the right\u2011most digit of the product, count back the total number of decimal places you recorded in Step\u202f1. Place the decimal point there. | Now the product has the correct size. |\n\n**What went well in our last exchange?**  \n- You correctly identified that 0.72 has **2** decimal places and 0.35 also has **2**, so the product will have **4** decimal places.",
