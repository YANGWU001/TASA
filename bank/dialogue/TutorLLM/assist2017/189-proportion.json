In other words, the *ratio* of flour\u202f:\u202fmuffins that works for 4\u202fcups\u202f:\u202f12\u202fmuffins must also work for the new number of muffins you want to bake.\n\nA helpful way to see this is:\n\n1. **Write the known ratio.**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{flour (cups)}}{\\text{muffins}}=\\frac{4}{12}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Replace the unknown part with a variable** (let\u2019s call it \\(x\\) cups of flour for 21 muffins).  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{21}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set the two ratios equal** because the relationship doesn\u2019t change.",

Once you have that, you can multiply by however many muffins you want.\n\nYou\u2019ve also had a couple of tough moments with area problems and pattern\u2011finding. Those topics both require looking for the \u201cconstant\u201d that links two things together (the side\u2011length\u2011to\u2011area factor, the rule that repeats in a pattern).
