Let\u2019s break the task into tiny, manageable pieces so you can see exactly what to do.\n\n**What to remember**\n\n1. **Perimeter = the distance all the way around a shape.**  \n2. For a rectangle, the opposite sides are equal, so you only need to add the length of one long side\u202f+\u202fone short side\u202f+\u202fthe same two sides again.  \n   In formula form:  \n\n   \\[\n   P = 2 \\times (\\text{length}) + 2 \\times (\\text{width})\n   \\]\n\n3. **Sketching helps** \u2013 when you see the numbers on a picture, it\u2019s easier to know which sides to add.\n\nLet\u2019s try a very short \u201cmini\u2011step\u201d together before moving on to the next practice problem.\n\n---\n\n### Mini\u2011Step (you can do this on a scrap piece of paper)\n\n1. **Draw** a quick rectangle.  \n2. Write **8\u202fm** on the top side and **5\u202fm** on the right side (you can put the same numbers on the opposite sides, or just remember they\u2019re equal).  \n3. **Count the sides** you need to add:  \n   - Two sides that are 8\u202fm each  \n   - Two sides that are 5\u202fm each  \n\nNow, try this tiny calculation on your own:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 8 + 8 + 5 + 5 = \\; ?\n\\]\n\nIf you get **26\u202fm**, you\u2019ve just solved the warm\u2011up!

Let\u2019s see where that number came from and why the correct perimeter is actually **26\u202fm**.\n\n1. **Recall the formula** \u2013 For any rectangle, the perimeter \\(P\\) is the sum of all four sides:  \n   \\[\n   P = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\n   \\]\n\n2. **Plug in the numbers** \u2013 Your garden is 8\u202fm long and 5\u202fm wide.  \n   \\[\n   P = 2 \\times (8 \\text{\u202fm} + 5 \\text{\u202fm}) = 2 \\times 13 \\text{\u202fm}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Do the multiplication** \u2013  \n   \\[\n   2 \\times 13 \\text{\u202fm} = 26 \\text{\u202fm}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Where did 24 come from?**  \n   If you added the two lengths (8\u202fm\u202f+\u202f8\u202fm\u202f=\u202f16\u202fm) and the two widths (5\u202fm\u202f+\u202f5\u202fm\u202f=\u202f10\u202fm), you would get 16\u202fm\u202f+\u202f10\u202fm\u202f=\u202f26\u202fm.  \n   A common slip is to add the length and width **once** (8\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f13) and then mistakenly multiply by **2** only for one pair of sides, ending up with \\(13 \\times 2 = 26\\",
