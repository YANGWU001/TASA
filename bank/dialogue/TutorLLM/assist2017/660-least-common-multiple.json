Let\u2019s turn that uncertainty into a clear path forward.\n\n1. **You\u2019re not alone.** Many students feel fuzzy about how far to go when they list multiples. The good news is that the \u201clist\u2011the\u2011multiples\u201d method works best when you keep going until you see a common number appear in *both* lists.\n\n2. **What \u201cfar enough\u201d looks like:**  \n   - Write out the first few multiples of each number (usually 5\u20136 terms).  \n   - Scan the two lists side\u2011by\u2011side. The *first* number that shows up in **both** lists is the **least common multiple** (LCM).  \n   - If you don\u2019t see a match after a few terms, just keep listing a few more\u2014you\u2019ll eventually hit the same number.\n\n3. **Why it matters:**  \n   - The LCM is the smallest size that works for *both* quantities at the same time.  \n   - It\u2019s a handy tool for solving word problems (e.g., \u201cWhen will two events that happen at different intervals line up again?\u201d).\n\n4. **Next step for you:**  \n   - Let\u2019s practice a short, focused problem where you\u2019ll apply the listing method.
