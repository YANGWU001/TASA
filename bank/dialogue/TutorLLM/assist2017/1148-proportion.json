That\u2019s a ratio of flour\u202f:\u202fpancakes = 2\u202f:\u202f8, which can be simplified to **1\u202fcup\u202f:\u202f4\u202fpancakes**.  \n\n2. **Scale the ratio** \u2013 Ask yourself: *If 1 cup gives me 4 pancakes, how many cups do I need for 20 pancakes?*  \n\n3. **Do the multiplication** \u2013 20 pancakes \u00f7 4 pancakes per cup = **5 cups** of flour.\n\nYou were on the right track by recognizing that a proportion is just a \u201cscaled\u2011up\u201d version of a known ratio.
