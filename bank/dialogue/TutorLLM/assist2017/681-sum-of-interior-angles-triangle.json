Add the two angles you already know.  \n3. Subtract that total from 180\u00b0 to find the missing angle.\n\nGive it a try, then check your answer below!  \n\n---  \n\n**Your answer:** ______________________  \n\n**Solution (you can peek after you\u2019ve tried):**  \n\n1.\u202f45\u00b0\u202f+\u202f55\u00b0\u202f=\u202f100\u00b0  \n2.\u202f180\u00b0\u202f\u2013\u202f100\u00b0\u202f=\u202f**80\u00b0**  \n\nSo the third angle measures **80\u00b0**.  \n\n---\n\n**Next step:** If you felt comfortable with this, let me know and we\u2019ll move on to a slightly trickier problem (e.g., finding a missing angle when the given angles are expressed in terms of a variable). If anything felt confusing, we can review the \u201csum\u2011of\u2011interior\u2011angles\u2011triangle = 180\u00b0\u201d rule together. \ud83c\udf1f",

Once we write down what each angle is, the 180\u00b0 rule does the rest.  Think of it like a puzzle: you already have the picture of the finished puzzle (180\u00b0), you just need to figure out where each piece goes.\n\n**Next step for you:**  \n1. **List what the problem tells you** \u2013 write each angle in words or with a variable.  \n2. **Identify any relationships** (e.g., \u201cAngle\u202fB is twice Angle\u202fA\u201d).  \n3. **Plug those expressions into the 180\u00b0 sum** and solve for the unknown.\n\nYou\u2019ve got the core idea; now we\u2019ll practice turning that idea into a quick, tidy equation.  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcda 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next Practice Question  \n\n> **Problem:** In triangle\u202f\\(ABC\\) the measure of angle\u202f\\(A\\) is **30\u00b0** less than the measure of angle\u202f\\(B\\).

Making connections is a great learning strategy; we just need to make sure the connection is the right one.\n\n**Where you got stuck**  \n- The interior angles of **any triangle** add up to **180\u00b0**, not 360\u00b0.  \n- The 360\u00b0 you\u2019re thinking of is the sum of the angles **around a point** (a full turn) or the interior angles of a **quadrilateral** (four\u2011sided shape).  \n\n**Why 180\u00b0 is the right number**  \n- One way to see it: take a triangle, cut off one corner, and \u201cflatten\u201d the three angles out in a straight line. A straight line measures 180\u00b0, so the three angles together must also be 180\u00b0.  \n- Another way: every triangle can be split into two right\u2011angled triangles (by drawing an altitude). Each right\u2011angled triangle has a 90\u00b0 angle, and the two extra acute angles from the split add up to the third angle of the original triangle. Adding the two 90\u00b0 pieces gives 180\u00b0.\n\n**How to use what you already know**  \nYou\u2019ve shown you can work with **supplementary angles** (two angles that add to 180\u00b0).

Making connections is a strong strategy \u2013 we just need to sort out which rule belongs where.\n\n**Where the confusion is**  \n- **Triangle vs. circle:** A full circle does indeed have 360\u00b0, but the interior angles of a *triangle* only add up to **180\u00b0**.  \n- **Supplementary angles** (two angles that add to 180\u00b0) are useful when you look at a straight line, not when you look at the three angles that close a triangle.\n\n**Why the sum is 180\u00b0**  \nOne quick way to see it is to \u201cflatten\u201d a triangle:\n\n1. Draw any triangle \\(ABC\\).  \n2. Extend side \\(BC\\) past \\(C\\) and draw a line through \\(C\\) that is parallel to side \\(AB\\).  \n3. Because the new line is parallel to \\(AB\\), the angle at \\(C\\) that you just created is *alternate interior* to \\(\\angle A\\).  \n4.

When you draw a triangle inside a circle and look at the \u201coutside\u201d angles, those exterior angles together do make a full 360\u00b0, but the *inside* angles themselves stay at 180\u00b0.  \n\n**Why 180\u00b0?**  \nThink of cutting a triangle out of a piece of paper and then \u201cflattening\u201d it out into a straight line.
