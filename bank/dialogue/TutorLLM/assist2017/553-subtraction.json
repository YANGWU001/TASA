Each left\u2011step is one unit subtracted. |\n| **Check with addition** | After you get an answer, add the subtrahend back to it. Does it give you the original minuend? (e.g., 47\u202f+\u202f37 = 84) |\n| **Write a \u201cscratch\u201d version** | Jot the numbers in column form, line up the digits, and borrow if needed. Even on paper, this habit reinforces the process. |\n\nGive one of these a try on the next question\u2014pick the one that feels most comfortable for you.
