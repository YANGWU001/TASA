First off, great job\u202f\u2014\u202fyou recognized that the side lengths are increasing by a constant amount (\u202f+2\u202fm\u202f) and you wrote down two possible formulas.

That\u2019s the key feature of an arithmetic pattern. |\n| You wrote \\(a_n = 2 + (n-1)\\times 2\\). | This is the standard \u201cfirst\u2011term\u202f+\u202f(number\u2011of\u2011steps\u202f\u00d7\u202fdifference)\u201d form, which works for any arithmetic sequence. |\n| You also suggested \\(a_n = 2n\\). | That\u2019s actually the *simplified* version of the same formula. Nice intuition! |\n\n**Where the confusion came from**\n\nBoth expressions you wrote describe the **exact same sequence**:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\na_n &= 2 + (n-1)\\times 2 \\\\\n    &= 2 + 2n - 2 \\\\\n    &= 2n .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nSo there\u2019s no need to choose one over the other\u2014just pick the one that feels most comfortable for you. In many problems we use the \u201cfirst\u2011term\u202f+\u202f(step\u202f\u00d7\u202fdifference)\u201d version because it makes it easy to see the underlying pattern, especially when the first term isn\u2019t as simple as 2.\n\n**How you can check your work**\n\n1. **Plug a few values of \\(n\\)** (like \\(n=1,2,3\\)) into each formula and see if you get the side lengths you expect:  \n   - \\(n=1\\):",

First off, I love how you\u2019re questioning the two formulas\u2014\u200bthat\u2019s exactly the kind of *meta\u2011thinking* that turns a good answer into a solid, confident one. Let\u2019s unpack what you wrote:\n\n| Formula you wrote | What it says in words |\n|-------------------|-----------------------|\n| \\(a_n = 2 + (n-1)\\times 2\\) | \u201cStart at 2\u202fm, then add 2\u202fm for every step after the first.\u201d |\n| \\(a_n = 2n\\) | \u201cTake the position number \\(n\\) and double it.\u201d |\n\nAt first glance they *look* different because the first one has a \u201c+\u202f2\u201d hanging out front, while the second one does not. The trick is to **simplify** the first expression:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\na_n &= 2 + (n-1)\\times 2 \\\\\n    &= 2 + 2n - 2 \\qquad\\text{(distribute the 2)}\\\\\n    &= 2n \\qquad\\text{(the +2 and \u20132 cancel)}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nSo **both formulas give exactly the same number** for every \\(n\\).  \n- For \\(n=1\\): \\(2 + (1-1)\\times2 = 2\\) and \\(2\\cdot1 = 2\\).  \n- For \\(n=4\\): \\(2 + (4-1)\\times2 = 2 + 6 = 8\\) and \\(2\\cdot4 = 8\\).\n\nBecause they are algebraically equivalent, you can safely use whichever version feels more intuitive to you.  \n\n---\n\n### Why this matters for pattern\u2011finding\n\nWhen you see a pattern like \u201cadd\u202f2 each time,\u201d you can describe it in two useful ways:\n\n1. **Recursive (step\u2011by\u2011step) description** \u2013 \u201cTake the previous term and add\u202f2.\u201d  \n2",
