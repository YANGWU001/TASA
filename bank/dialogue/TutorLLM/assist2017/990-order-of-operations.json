Here are three quick reminders that usually help:\n\n| Step | What to do | Why it matters |\n|------|------------|----------------|\n| 1\ufe0f\u20e3  | **Parentheses\u202f/\u202fBrackets** \u2013 do everything inside them first. | They tell you which part of the problem is grouped together. |\n| 2\ufe0f\u20e3  | **Exponents** \u2013 evaluate powers and roots next. | Exponents change the size of a number dramatically; they must be handled before you multiply or add. |\n| 3\ufe0f\u20e3  | **Multiplication\u202f/\u202fDivision** (left\u2011to\u2011right) **then** **Addition\u202f/\u202fSubtraction** (left\u2011to\u2011right). | These are the \u201cmiddle\u201d steps. Doing them in the wrong order can flip the whole answer. |\n\nA common mistake is to **skip the left\u2011to\u2011right rule** for multiplication/division or addition/subtraction. For example, in `8 \u00f7 2 \u00d7 4` you should compute `8 \u00f7 2 = 4` first, then `4 \u00d7 4 = 16` (not `8 \u00f7 (2\u00d74) = 1`).  \n\nSince you\u2019ve also struggled a bit with pattern\u2011finding, let\u2019s blend the two ideas: we\u2019ll give you a short \u201cpattern cue\u201d that tells you which operation to do next, then you\u2019ll apply the order\u2011of\u2011operations rules.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f Practice Question\n\n**Evaluate the expression below.
