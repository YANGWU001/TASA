If a numerator and a denominator share a factor, you can divide them out first; this keeps the numbers smaller and makes the simplification step easier.\n\nLet\u2019s see this in action with a simple example that is *just like* the problem you were given:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{8} \\times \\frac{5}{6}\n\\]\n\n*Step\u202f1 \u2013 Multiply numerators:* \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\)  \n*Step\u202f2 \u2013 Multiply denominators:* \\(8 \\",
