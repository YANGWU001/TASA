Each row is as long as the rectangle\u2019s length. Then you stack as many rows as the width tells you. Multiplying the two counts gives the total number of little squares.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcd8 A Worked\u2011Example (the same rug you saw)\n\n- **Length** = 8\u202fcm  \n- **Width** = 3\u202fcm  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}=8\\text{\u202fcm}\\times 3\\text{\u202fcm}=24\\text{\u202fcm}^2\n\\]\n\nSo the rug covers **24\u202fcm\u00b2** of floor space.\n\n> **Take a moment:** Can you picture 24 little 1\u2011cm squares filling the rug?

The short answer is that the standard \u201cunit square\u201d is a 1\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202fcm square (or 1\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202fm, etc.). When we multiply length by width we are literally counting how many of those 1\u2011by\u20111 squares would tile the rectangle without gaps or overlaps. That\u2019s why the unit gets squared: it\u2019s a two\u2011dimensional measure.\n\n**Next step:** Let\u2019s practice turning a word problem into that \u201clittle\u2011square\u201d picture and then using the formula.
