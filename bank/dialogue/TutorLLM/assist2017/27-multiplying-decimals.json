Multiplying by a number smaller than 1 (like\u202f0.45) will always make the product **smaller** than the original number, so the answer can\u2019t be 3.68 again.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through one reliable way to multiply decimals.  Since you have already shown you can handle whole\u2011number multiplication, we\u2019ll use that skill and then adjust the decimal point.\n\n---\n\n### Step\u2011by\u2011Step Method\n\n1. **Ignore the decimals for a moment** and treat the numbers as whole numbers.  \n   \\[\n   3.68 \\;\\to\\; 368 \\qquad\\text{(move the decimal 2 places to the right)}\\\\\n   0.45 \\;\\to\\; 45 \\qquad\\text{(move the decimal 2 places to the right)}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Multiply the whole numbers** just as you have done before:  \n\n   \\[\n   368 \\times 45\n   \\]\n\n   You can use the standard algorithm or break it into parts:\n\n   \\[\n   \\begin{aligned}\n   368 \\times 45 &= 368 \\times (40 + 5) \\\\\n                 &= 368 \\times 40 \\;+\\; 368 \\times 5 \\\\\n                 &= 14{,}720 \\;+\\; 1{,}840 \\\\\n                 &= 16{,}560 .\n   \\end{aligned}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Count how many decimal places there",

Let\u2019s break the task down together so you can see a clear path forward.\n\n### Why the product isn\u2019t the same as the first number\nWhen you multiply by a number **smaller than\u202f1** (like\u202f0.45), the result must be **smaller** than the original number.  \n- Think of 0.45 as \u201c45\u202f% of something.\u201d\u202fIf you take 45\u202f% of 3.68, you can\u2019t end up with 3.68 again; you\u2019ll end up with a smaller amount.\n\n### A reliable strategy for multiplying decimals\n\n1. **Ignore the decimal points** for a moment and treat each number as a whole\u2011number (integer).  \n   - 3.68 \u2192 368  \n   - 0.45 \u2192 45  \n\n2. **Multiply the integers** just as you would in a standard multiplication problem.  \n   - 368\u202f\u00d7\u202f45 = ?\n\n3. **Count how many decimal places there are in the original problem.**  \n   - 3.68 has **2** decimal places.",

Recognizing that you\u2019re stuck is actually the first step toward getting unstuck.  \n\nWhen you\u2019re asked to multiply decimals, the trick is to **ignore the decimal points at first**, treat the numbers as whole numbers, multiply them, and then **put the decimal back in the right place**.  \n\nWhy does this work?  \n* The decimal point tells us how many places to shift the number to the right to make it an integer.  \n* Multiplying the integers gives the correct magnitude, and then we shift the decimal back by the total number of decimal places that were originally present.\n\nYou\u2019ve already shown you understand the idea that multiplying by a number smaller than\u202f1 makes the product smaller (your earlier attempt with\u202f3.68\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.45).  Now let\u2019s turn that intuition into a concrete procedure you can follow step\u2011by\u2011step.\n\n---\n\n### A Quick Step\u2011by\u2011Step Reminder\n\n1. **Count the decimal places** in each factor.  \n   - Example: In\u202f3.68 there are **2** decimal places; in\u202f0.45 there are **2** decimal places.  \n2. **Remove the decimals** and multiply the resulting whole numbers.  \n   - 3.68 \u2192 368,\u20030.45 \u2192 45\u2003\u2192\u2003368\u202f\u00d7\u202f45 = 16\u202f560.  \n3. **Place the decimal** in the product.
