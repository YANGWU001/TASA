That\u2019s completely okay; it happens when we\u2019re juggling several ideas at once. Here are a few pointers to help you finish this problem (and similar ones) with confidence:\n\n| What to watch for | Why it matters | Quick tip |\n|-------------------|----------------|-----------|\n| **Identify the correct dimensions** | The bottom of the pool is a *flat* surface, so we only need the **length** and **width** (the depth is not part of the bottom\u2019s area). | Write \u201cLength = 5\u202fm, Width = 2\u202fm\u201d on a separate line before you start the formula. |\n| **Use the right formula** | For a rectangle, **Area = length \u00d7 width**. | Write the formula first:\u202f`Area = L \u00d7 W`. Then plug in the numbers. |\n| **Keep units consistent** | All dimensions are already in meters, so the area will be in square meters (m\u00b2). | After you compute, attach the unit \u201cm\u00b2\u201d \u2013 it helps you check that the answer makes sense. |\n| **Check the magnitude** | A 5\u202fm \u00d7 2\u202fm rectangle is about the size of a small bedroom floor. Its area should be around 10\u202fm\u00b2. | If you get something wildly different (e.g., 0.1\u202fm\u00b2 or 100\u202fm\u00b2), re\u2011check the numbers. |\n\n**What a complete answer would look like**\n\n> The bottom of the pool is a rectangle.  \n> Length\u202f=\u202f5\u202fm, Width\u202f=\u202f2\u202fm.  \n> Area\u202f=\u202fLength\u202f\u00d7\u202fWidth\u202f=\u202f5\u202fm\u202f\u00d7",

The next part is just applying the **area formula for a rectangle**:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width}.\n\\]\n\nBecause the pool\u2019s bottom is flat, we only need the two linear dimensions that define that face (the length and the width).
