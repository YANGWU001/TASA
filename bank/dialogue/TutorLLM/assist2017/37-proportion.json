It lets us compare one \u201cpart\u201d of a situation to another \u201cpart\u201d and then scale up or down.  \n* **Why it matters for the lemonade problem:** The recipe gives us a *ratio* of water\u202f:\u202flemonade (4\u202fcups\u202f:\u202f2\u202fL). If we keep that ratio the same, we can find out how much water we need for any other amount of lemonade (like 5\u202fL).  \n* **Common hurdle:** Many students try to \u201cguess\u201d the answer instead of first writing the two ratios side\u2011by\u2011side and then solving the equation. That\u2019s why we\u2019ll start by explicitly setting up the proportion for you.\n\nYou\u2019ve shown difficulty with proportion (38\u202f% correct) and also with area problems, which often require turning a word problem into an equation.
