Both require careful bookkeeping of pieces. |\n| **Area question** \u2013 you missed a rectangle area. | The squares in the theorem are literally *areas* (e.g., a\u00b2 is the area of a square built",

It\u2019s also the key to many geometry problems (areas, distances, even some probability\u2011geometry questions you\u2019ve seen before).\n\n**Next steps for you**  \n1. **Visualize** \u2013 Draw a right\u2011angled triangle and label the sides. Seeing the right angle helps you remember which side is the hypotenuse.  \n2. **Remember the pattern** \u2013 \u201c**A**\u00b2 + **B**\u00b2 = **C**\u00b2\u201d (the letters are in alphabetical order, just like the sides).  \n3. **Practice with simple numbers** \u2013 Start with whole\u2011number triples (3\u20114\u20115, 5\u201112\u201113, 8\u201115\u201117). Once you\u2019re comfortable, move to non\u2011integer lengths.  \n\nYou\u2019ll get more confident with each try, and the \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d will turn into \u201cI see how to solve it!\u201d  \n\n---\n\n###",
