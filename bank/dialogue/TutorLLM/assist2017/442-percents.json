If a paperback normally costs **\\$24**, how much will the paperback cost during the sale?\n\n---\n\n### How to approach it\n\n1. **Convert the percent to a decimal.**  \n  \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f25\u202f% = 25 \u00f7 100 = **0.25**\n\n2. **Find the amount of the discount.**  \n  \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202fDiscount = (decimal)\u202f\u00d7\u202f(original price)  \n\n3. **Subtract the discount from the original price** to get the sale price.\n\n---\n\n### What to write down\n\n- Show the conversion from percent to decimal.  \n- Write the multiplication you use to find the discount.  \n- Show the subtraction step that gives the final price.  \n\n---\n\nGive it a try and tell me what you get (including the steps you used).

Convert the percent to a decimal: 15\u202f% = ___  \n2. Multiply the decimal by the original price to find the discount amount.  \n3. Subtract the discount from the original price to get the sale price.\n\nGive it a try, and let me know how you\u2019re thinking through each step.

Often the first step is just *identifying* the percent you\u2019re being asked about. |\n| **I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll get it wrong** | Remember that making a mistake is part of learning. Try a quick estimate first (e.g., \u201c10\u202f% of 150 is 15, so 20\u202f% should be about 30\u201d) to see if your answer feels reasonable. |\n\nWhenever you hit \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d try one of those prompts before asking for help.
