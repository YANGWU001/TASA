Start subtracting from the rightmost (ones) column. If the top digit is smaller than the bottom digit, you\u2019ll need to *borrow* from the tens column.  \n3.

Those often require you to **subtract** the \u201cmissing\u201d part of a shape (e.g., \u201cWhat area is left after cutting out a smaller rectangle?\u201d).
