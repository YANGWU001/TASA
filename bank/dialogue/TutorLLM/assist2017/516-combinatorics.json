Break it into parts** | If there are several roles (e.g., speakers, researchers), count each part separately. | Makes a big problem manageable. |\n| **4. Multiply / add** | Use the multiplication rule for independent choices, the addition rule for mutually exclusive choices. | Gives the total number of possibilities. |\n| **5.
