Let\u2019s turn that uncertainty into clarity by revisiting the core ideas, step\u2011by\u2011step, and then give you a fresh problem to try.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Refresher: What Is the LCM?\n\nThe **least common multiple** of two (or more) positive integers is the **smallest positive number that is a multiple of each of them**.\n\n### Two Ways to Find It\n\n1. **Listing Multiples** (good for small numbers)  \n   - Write out a few multiples of each number.  \n   - Identify the first (smallest) number that appears in *both* lists.\n\n2. **Prime\u2011Factor Method** (more efficient for larger numbers)  \n   - Break each number into its prime factors.  \n   - For each distinct prime, take the *highest* exponent that appears in any factorization.  \n   - Multiply those \u201chighest\u2011power\u201d primes together.\n\nBoth methods give the same answer; you can pick whichever feels more comfortable.\n\n---\n\n## Why 24 Is the LCM of 8 and 12 (and Not 20)\n\n| Multiples of 8 | Multiples of 12 |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| 8, **16**, **24**, 32, 40, \u2026 | 12, **24**, 36, 48, \u2026 |\n\n- The first common entry is **24**.  \n- 20 is *not* a multiple of 8 (20 \u00f7 8 = 2.5) nor of 12 (20 \u00f7 12 \u2248 1.67), so it can\u2019t be the LCM.\n\n---\n\n## Connecting LCM to Probability (since you\u2019ve struggled with probability problems)\n\nSometimes probability questions ask you to \u201cfind the number of ways something can happen in a certain time frame,\u201d and the L",
