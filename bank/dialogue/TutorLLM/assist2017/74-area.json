You correctly noted that the triangle sits on top of the rectangle and that its base equals the rectangle\u2019s width (5\u202fm).

That kind of \u201cI\u2019ll give it a shot\u201d attitude is exactly what leads to breakthroughs. | **Using proportion to check the height** \u2013 You guessed the triangle\u2019s height by looking at the picture, which is a good first step. To be more confident, turn that visual guess into a *proportion*:\u202fIf the rectangle\u2019s side is 4\u202fm and the small vertical line looks about half as long, write the relationship\u202f\\( \\frac{\\text{triangle height}}{4\\text{\u202fm}} \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\). Then solve for the height. This will give you a numerical value (2\u202fm) that you can justify mathematically, not just visually. |\n| **Linking the height to the area formula** \u2013 You remembered that the height is needed to find the area of the triangle. | **Connecting the proportion to the whole problem** \u2013 After you find the height, make sure you also compute the rectangle\u2019s area and then add the two areas (or subtract, depending on the shape). Write each step clearly: 1\ufe0f\u20e3\u202fFind the missing dimension using a proportion, 2\ufe0f\u20e3\u202fCompute each area, 3\ufe0f\u20e3\u202fCombine them.
