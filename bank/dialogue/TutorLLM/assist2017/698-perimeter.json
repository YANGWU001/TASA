That\u2019s a totally normal place to get stuck.\u202fThe key thing to remember is:\n\n- **Perimeter** is the **total distance around** a shape.  \n- For most polygons you **add** the lengths of all the sides, **not multiply** them.  \n- The only time you \u201cmultiply\u201d is when you use a *formula* that already combines addition for you (e.g., for a rectangle\u202f\\(P = 2\\,(l+w)\\); the \u201c2\u201d is a multiplier, but the inside is still an addition).\n\nSo, the first step is to **identify each side** (or a pair of equal sides) and then **sum** them up.
