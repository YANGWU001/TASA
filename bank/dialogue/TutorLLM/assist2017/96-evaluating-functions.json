It\u2019s completely fine to feel stuck at the start \u2013\u202fevaluating functions is a skill that becomes much easier once you see the pattern.  \n\nWhen we \u201cevaluate\u201d a function, we\u2019re simply plugging the given number (the *input*) into the formula and doing the arithmetic step\u2011by\u2011step.
