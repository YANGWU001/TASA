Fill in each region of the diagram with the correct number of students.  \n3. Answer the following questions based on your diagram:  \n\n   a. How many students like **only soccer**?  \n   b. How many students like **only basketball**?  \n   c. How many students like **neither** soccer nor basketball?\n\n---\n\n### How to approach it\n\n1. **Start with the overlap** \u2013 the region where the two circles intersect represents the students who like *both* sports. Write **7** there.  \n2. **Only soccer** \u2013 subtract the \u201cboth\u201d count from the total who like soccer:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Only soccer} = 18 - 7 = 11\n   \\]  \n   Put **11** in the part of the soccer circle that does *not* overlap.  \n3. **Only basketball** \u2013 subtract the \u201cboth\u201d count from the total who like basketball:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Only basketball} = 12 - 7 = 5\n   \\]  \n   Put **5**",
