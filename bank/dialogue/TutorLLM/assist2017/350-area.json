Remember that perimeter adds the sides together (2\u202f\u00d7\u202flength\u202f+\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth). Knowing both area and perimeter for the same rectangle can help you see the relationship between the two concepts. |\n\nTry writing the area formula on a piece of paper, then substitute the numbers you have.
