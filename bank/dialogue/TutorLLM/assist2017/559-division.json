In the problem  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{84}{7}= ?\n\\]\n\nwe are asking: *If we have 84 objects and we put them into groups of 7, how many groups do we get?*  \n\nThink of it like:\n\n* 84\u202f\u00f7\u202f7 = \u201cHow many 7\u2019s are in 84?\u201d  \n* Or, \u201cWhat number multiplied by 7 gives 84?\u201d\n\nBecause you\u2019re just beginning, let\u2019s try a concrete, visual way to see the answer before we write down the final number.\n\n---\n\n### A Quick Strategy You Can Try Right Now\n\n1. **Repeated Subtraction** \u2013 Keep taking away 7 from 84 until you reach 0.

Let\u2019s look at why **84 \u00f7\u202f7** isn\u2019t 11 and how we can find the correct answer together.\n\n| Step | What you thought | What actually happens |\n|------|------------------|-----------------------|\n| 1. Identify the dividend and divisor | 84 is the number you\u2019re sharing, 7 is the number of groups. | \u2714\ufe0f Same idea. |\n| 2. Guess the quotient | You guessed 11 because 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f11\u202f=\u202f77. | 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f11 = **77**, which is *close* but not the whole 84. |\n| 3. Check the remainder | 84\u202f\u2212\u202f77\u202f=\u202f7 left over. | There\u2019s still **7** left to share. |\n| 4. Add one more group | If we give that leftover 7 to another group, we have one more group of 7. | 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f**12** = **84** \u2013 all the pieces are used. |\n\nSo the correct answer is **12**, not 11.

That\u2019s a reasonable guess, but let\u2019s see how it lines up with the information in the problem.\n\n1. **What the problem is asking** \u2013 Usually a \u201ctokens\u2011in\u2011each\u2011bag\u201d question is a *division* problem:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{tokens per bag} = \\frac{\\text{total tokens}}{\\text{number of bags}}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Check the numbers** \u2013 If the total number of tokens is, say, 70 and there are 5 bags, the correct calculation would be  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{70}{5}=14.\n   \\]  \n   In that very specific case your answer **would be right**.  \n\n   However, if the total or the number of bags is different (for example 84 tokens in 6 bags, or 70 tokens in 7 bags), the answer changes. The key is to *plug the actual numbers from the problem into the division*.\n\n3. **Why you might have guessed 14** \u2013 It\u2019s easy to mix up the numbers or to try \u201cdivide\u2011and\u2011multiply\u201d in your head. Since you mentioned multiplication has been tricky for you, it\u2019s understandable that the division step feels fuzzy.\n\n### What to focus on next\n- **Identify the two numbers** you need to divide (total items\u202f\u00f7\u202fgroups). Write them down explicitly before you start the calculation.\n- **Do the division** either by long\u2011division, using a number line, or by thinking of the *inverse* of multiplication (e.g., \u201cWhat number times the number of bags gives the total?\u201d).  \n- **Check your work** by multiplying the quotient you found by the divisor. If you get back the original total, you\u2019re correct.\n\nYou\u2019re on the right track\u2014just make sure the numbers you\u2019re dividing",
