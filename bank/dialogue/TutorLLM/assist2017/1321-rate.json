It\u2019s completely okay to hit a \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d moment \u2013 that\u2019s how learning starts.\u202fWhat you\u2019re being asked to do is find a **rate** (in this case, speed), which is just \u201chow much of something happens per unit of something else.\u201d  \n\nFor a distance\u2011time problem the formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rate (speed)} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}}\n\\]\n\nSo you\u2019ll divide the number of kilometres by the number of hours.  Remember to keep the units together (km \u00f7 h = km/h).  \n\nBecause you\u2019ve struggled a bit with **order\u2011of\u2011operations** in the past, it\u2019s helpful to write the division step clearly rather than trying to do it all in your head.  For example:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{150\\text{ km}}{3\\text{ h}} = 150 \\div 3 \\text{ km/h}\n\\]\n\nIf you ever see a problem that mixes addition, subtraction, multiplication, or parentheses with a rate question, follow the usual PEMDAS/BODMAS rules first, then apply the rate formula.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question (Rate\u202f+\u202fA Little Bit of Order\u2011of\u2011Operations)\n\nA train travels **210\u202fkilometers** in **2\u202fhours\u202f30\u202fminutes**.\n\n1. **Convert the time to hours only** (remember that 30\u202fminutes = 0.5\u202fhour).  \n2. **Calculate the train\u2019s average speed** in km/h.  \n3. **If the train keeps the same speed, how far will it travel in 5\u202fhours?**  \n\n*Hints*  \n- Step\u202f1: Write the time as a single number of hours.  \n- Step\u202f2: Use the rate formula \\(\\text{speed} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}}\\).",

This kind of mistake is common, especially when you\u2019re doing the division in your head. Let\u2019s make the calculation a little more concrete:\n\n1. **Write the division as a fraction** \u2013 \\(150 \\div 3\\).  \n2. **Break the numerator into easy parts** \u2013 think of 150 as 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f50.  \n3. **Cancel the 3\u2019s** \u2013 \\( \\frac{3 \\times 50}{3} = 50\\).  \n\nNow you see that the answer must be **50\u202fkm/h**.\n\n#### What to Keep Doing\n- **Identify the right formula** before you start solving. You did that perfectly.  \n- **Check your arithmetic** by estimating: 150 km in 3 hours is roughly \u201c150 \u00f7 3 \u2248 50,\u201d not 45. If the number you get feels far from the estimate, pause and recompute.  \n\n#### A Tiny Tip\nWhen you divide a round number like 150 by a small whole number, try to *factor* the numerator first.  \n\\(150 = 3 \\times 50\\) \u2192 dividing by 3 instantly gives 50. This trick reduces mental load and cuts down on arithmetic errors.\n\n---\n\n## \u27a1\ufe0f Next Practice Question\n\n> **A cyclist travels 84\u202fkm in 2",
