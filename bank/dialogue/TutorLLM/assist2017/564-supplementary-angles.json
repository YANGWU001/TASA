That\u2019s the most important piece of the puzzle, and it shows you have the core idea in place.\n\n**What was right**\n\n- **Identifying \u201csupplementary\u201d** \u2013 you correctly noted that the two angles must sum to 180\u00b0.  \n- **Choosing numbers that add to 180\u00b0** \u2013\u202f60\u00b0\u202f+\u202f120\u00b0\u202f=\u202f180\u00b0, so the pair you wrote *does* satisfy the \u201csupplementary\u201d condition.\n\n**What needs a little more work**\n\nThe original problem gave you **additional information** (e.g., one angle is twice the other, the difference between them is a certain number, or they are related to a third angle).  \nBecause you only used the \u201csum\u2011to\u2011180\u201d rule, the pair 60\u00b0\u202fand\u202f120\u00b0 is a *possible* solution, but we can\u2019t be sure it\u2019s the *only* one that fits the whole problem.\n\n**How to bridge the gap**\n\n1. **Write down every piece of information** the problem gives you before you start solving.  \n2. **Translate each piece into an equation**.  \n   - Example: \u201cOne angle is three times the other\u201d \u2192\u202fx\u202f+\u202f3x\u202f=\u202f180.  \n   - Example: \u201cThe larger angle exceeds the smaller by 30\u00b0\u201d \u2192\u202fy\u202f=\u202fx\u202f+\u202f30 and x\u202f+\u202fy\u202f=\u202f180.  \n3. **Solve the system of equations** (usually just one equation with one unknown, but sometimes two).  \n4. **Check your answer** by plugging the numbers back into *all* the original statements.\n\nYou\u2019re already on the right track by remembering the 180\u00b0 rule.
