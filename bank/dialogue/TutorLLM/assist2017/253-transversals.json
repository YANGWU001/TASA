For \u2220\u202f4\u202f=\u202f110\u00b0, you could state: \u201c\u2220\u202f4 is the exterior angle at vertex\u202fD, and because the interior angles on a straight line sum to 180\u00b0, the adjacent interior angle must be 70\u00b0, so the exterior must be 110\u00b0.\u201d  \n2. **Connecting to the transversals concept** \u2013 The problem you just solved involved an exterior angle, but many \u201ctransversal\u201d questions ask you to relate *same\u2011side interior* or *alternate interior* angles.  Practicing those relationships will boost your accuracy (currently 33\u202f%).  \n\n> **Bottom line:** You nailed the identification part\u2014great!
