Below is a quick \u201ccheat\u2011sheet\u201d you can keep handy.  \n\n| Step | What you do | Why it works |\n|------|-------------|--------------|\n| 1\ufe0f\u20e3  | Write the whole number as a fraction (put it over 1). | Every whole number can be expressed as a fraction:\u202f\\(2 = \\dfrac{2}{1}\\). |\n| 2\ufe0f\u20e3  | Change the division sign to multiplication. | Division = multiplication by the reciprocal. |\n| 3\ufe0f\u20e3  | Flip (take the reciprocal of) the fraction you\u2019re dividing **by**. | The reciprocal of \\(\\dfrac{2}{1}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\). |\n| 4\ufe0f\u20e3  | Multiply the numerators together and the denominators together. | That\u2019s how you multiply fractions. |\n| 5\ufe0f\u20e3  | Simplify the resulting fraction, if possible. | The answer should be in simplest form. |\n\nYou can try these steps on the problem we just gave you ( \\(\\frac{3}{8} \u00f7 2\\) ) on a piece of paper.
