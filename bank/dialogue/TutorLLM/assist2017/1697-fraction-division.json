Admitting that you\u2019re stuck is actually a **very useful** piece of information for both of us. It tells me that the \u201cflip\u2011and\u2011multiply\u201d (also called \u201cmultiply by the reciprocal\u201d) idea for **dividing fractions** still needs a bit more practice.\n\n### Why this matters\n- **Fraction\u2011division** is the bridge that connects the other topics you\u2019ve been working on:  \n  - When you solved the **divisibility** problem, you were looking for whole\u2011number answers.  Dividing fractions often gives you a non\u2011whole answer, so the \u201cflip\u2011and\u2011multiply\u201d step helps you get there.  \n  - In the **rate** problem you were comparing two quantities (e.g., miles per hour).  Rates are essentially *fractions* (distance \u00f7 time), and dividing one rate by another is another way of dividing fractions.  \n  - The **probability** question required you to think about parts of a whole, which is also a fraction concept.  When you divide probabilities, you\u2019re again using the same operation.\n\n### What to try next time  \n1. **Recall the recipe:**  \n   - **Step\u202f1:** Write the division problem as a multiplication problem.  \n   - **Step\u202f2:** *Flip* the second fraction (take its reciprocal).  \n   - **Step\u202f3:** Multiply the numerators together and the denominators together.  \n   - **Step\u202f4:** Simplify if possible.  \n\n2. **Talk it out:** Even if you\u2019re not sure, try saying the steps out loud or writing a quick sketch.  \u201cI need to flip the second fraction\u2026\u201d often sparks the memory.\n\n3. **Use a concrete example:** Pick numbers you\u2019re comfortable with (like \u00bd \u00f7 \u00bc) and work through the steps on paper.
