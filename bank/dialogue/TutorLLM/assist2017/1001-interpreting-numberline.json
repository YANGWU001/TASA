Interpreting a number line means translating the visual position into a numerical value (or the symbol you\u2019ve been given for that value).\n\n2. **Why \u201cC\u201d might feel right** \u2013 It\u2019s common to look for a label that *looks* close to the point, especially when the labels are placed near the tick marks.
