Add the ones\u2011place first, then the tens, then the hundreds, carrying over when needed. |\n| **You\u2019re not sure which operation to use** | Look for clues in the wording (e.g., \u201caltogether,\u201d \u201ctotal,\u201d \u201ccombined\u201d) \u2013 those usually mean addition. |\n| **You lose track of the carry** | Write the numbers one under the other, line up the digits, and use a pencil mark (or a small \u201c+\u201d) to remind you when you need to carry. |\n| **You feel rushed** | Take a deep breath, read the problem twice, and underline the numbers you need to add. Slow, steady work beats speed. |\n\nLet\u2019s put one of these strategies into practice right now. I\u2019ll give you a problem that focuses on addition\u2014something you\u2019ve been working on\u2014and we\u2019ll walk through it together step\u2011by\u2011step.
