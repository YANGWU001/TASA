The important thing is that you\u2019re willing to try, and that\u2019s the first step toward mastering the skill.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick reminder of the *process* we use when we divide decimals:\n\n1. **Turn the divisor (the number you\u2019re dividing **by**) into a whole number.**  \n   - We do this by moving the decimal point to the right until there are no digits after it.  \n   - Whatever we do to the divisor, we must do to the dividend (the number we\u2019re dividing **into**) so the value of the problem doesn\u2019t change.\n\n2. **Divide as if you were working with whole numbers.**  \n   - Use the standard long\u2011division steps or a calculator if you prefer.\n\n3. **Interpret the result.**  \n   - If the question asks for \u201chow many whole \u2026 can you buy?\u201d we ignore any fractional remainder (because you can\u2019t buy a fraction of a sticker).\n\nLet\u2019s apply those ideas to the sticker problem you saw:\n\n- **Dividend:** $7.20  \n- **Divisor:** $0.45  \n\n**Step\u202f1:** Move the decimal in the divisor two places to the right (0.45 \u2192 45).  \nDo the same to the dividend: 7.20 \u2192 720.\n\n**Step\u202f2:** Now divide 720 \u00f7 45.  \n(You can do the long\u2011division, or notice that 45 \u00d7 16 = 720.)\n\n**Step\u202f3:** The quotient is 16, which means you can buy **16 whole stickers** with $7.20.

Here are a few ideas that usually help students get comfortable with dividing decimals:\n\n1. **Turn the problem into whole\u2011number division.**  \n   Move the decimal point in both numbers the same number of places so that you\u2019re dividing whole numbers. (You\u2019ll just have to remember to move the decimal point back in the answer.)\n\n2. **Estimate first.**  \n   Before you do any calculations, ask yourself roughly how many times the price could fit into the money you have. This gives you a sanity check for your final answer.\n\n3. **Check with multiplication.**  \n   After you get a quotient, multiply it by the price of one sticker. If the product is \u2264\u202f$7.20, you\u2019re on the right track.\n\n4. **Focus on \u201cwhole stickers.\u201d**  \n   The question is asking for the *largest whole number* of stickers you can buy, so if your division gives a decimal, just drop the fraction (don\u2019t round up).\n\nYou\u2019ve already taken the first step by trying the problem, and that\u2019s the most important part of learning. Let\u2019s give it another go using the strategy above\u2014feel free to write down each step as you go.
