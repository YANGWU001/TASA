Distribute** | Remove the parentheses by multiplying each term inside. | Turns the equation into a \u201cflat\u201d sum of terms you can see together. |\n| **2. Combine like terms** | Add or subtract the constants and the variable\u2011terms on each side. | Gives you a single term with\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fand a single constant on each side. |\n| **3. Isolate the variable** | Move everything that isn\u2019t\u202f\\(x\\)\u202fto the opposite side (usually by adding/subtracting) and then divide or multiply to get \\(x\\) alone. | Leaves the unknown by itself so you can read its value. |\n\nIf you ever feel unsure, try writing each of those steps out on a piece of paper before moving on.

What matters most is that you\u2019re here and ready to keep trying.\n\nA few things to keep in mind:\n\n| What you\u2019re working on | Why it matters | A quick reminder |\n|------------------------|----------------|------------------|\n| **Distributing** (e.g.,\u202f\\(4(2x-3)\\)) | Turns the parentheses into a sum of separate terms so you can combine them later. | Multiply the outside number by each term inside: \\(4\u00b72x\\) and \\(4\u00b7(-3)\\). |\n| **Combining like terms** | Lets you simplify the equation to a single\u2011variable form. | Add or subtract terms that have the same variable (e.g., all the \\(x\\) terms together). |\n| **Isolating the variable** | Gives you the value of \\(x\\). | Move everything else to the other side using addition/subtraction, then divide or multiply as needed. |\n\nBecause you\u2019ve had trouble with **percent\u2011of** and **rate\u2011distance\u2011time** problems in the past, it can be helpful to see the same algebraic steps in a familiar context. For example, a \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d problem often requires you to set up an equation first\u2014so mastering the equation\u2011solving steps will make those word problems easier later on.\n\n**What to try next",

That strategy does exactly what good problem\u2011solvers do: they turn the math language into \u201cplain English\u201d first, then decide how to translate it into an equation.\n\n**What\u2019s working well**\n\n- **Self\u2011awareness:** You noticed the gap (\u201cI don\u2019t recognize the operation\u201d) and suggested a concrete way to bridge it.  \n- **Willingness to try a new tactic:** Putting the problem into words is a powerful tool, especially for word\u2011problems that involve percentages or unknowns.\n\n**A tiny tip to make the tactic even stronger**\n\nAfter you write the sentence, try **highlighting the key numbers and the words that signal an operation** (e.g., \u201cof,\u201d \u201cmore than,\u201d \u201cless than,\u201d \u201ctotal,\u201d \u201cdifference\u201d). Those cue words often point directly to the algebraic symbol you need (+, \u2013, \u00d7, \u00f7) or to a percentage\u2011conversion step.\n\nKeep using that \u201csentence first\u201d habit\u2014it will help you move from the \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d stage to the \u201cI can set up the equation\u201d stage much faster. \ud83d\udc4d\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcda Next Practice Question (Focused on Equation\u2011Concept)\n\n### Word Problem\n\n> **A school is buying new laptops.**  \n> The school needs **15% more** laptops than the 80 laptops they currently have.  \n> Each laptop costs **$720**.  \n> The school\u2019s budget",
