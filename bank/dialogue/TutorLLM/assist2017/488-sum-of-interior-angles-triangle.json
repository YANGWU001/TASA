When you know two of the angles, you can simply subtract their sum from 180\u00b0 to find the missing one.  \n\nYou didn\u2019t give a numerical answer, which tells me you might still be unsure how to apply the \u201csum\u2011to\u2011180\u00b0\u201d rule.  Let\u2019s break it down step\u2011by\u2011step:\n\n1. **Write the equation**:  \u2220A + \u2220B + \u2220C = 180\u00b0.  \n2. **Plug in the numbers you know**:  40\u00b0 + 65\u00b0 + \u2220C = 180\u00b0.  \n3. **Add the known angles**:  40\u00b0 + 65\u00b0 = 105\u00b0.  \n4. **Solve for the unknown**:  \u2220C = 180\u00b0 \u2013 105\u00b0 = **75\u00b0**.\n\nTry doing the same process on the next problem without looking at the answer first\u2014just write the equation, substitute, and solve.

That\u2019s exactly the right approach.\n\nRecall the key fact we\u2019ve been practicing:  \n\n*The interior angles of any triangle always add up to **180\u00b0**.*\n\nSo the missing angle is found by subtracting the sum of the two known angles from 180\u00b0:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Missing angle}=180^\\circ-(45^\\circ+60^\\circ)=180^\\circ-105^\\circ=75^\\circ.\n\\]\n\nYou were on the right track\u2014just remember the final subtraction step. If you ever feel uncertain, you can write the three\u2011step scaffold:\n\n1. **Add** the two given angles.  \n2. **Subtract** that sum from 180\u00b0.  \n3. The result is the missing angle.\n\nSince you\u2019ve already practiced supplementary angles (two angles that add to 180\u00b0), you can think of the triangle\u2019s interior angles as a *group* of three angles that together are supplementary to a straight line. That connection often makes the \u201c180\u00b0\u201d rule feel more familiar.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Given:** In triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\), the measures of two interior angles are \\( 78^\\circ \\) and \\( 53^\\circ \\).  \n\n**Task:** Find the measure of the third interior angle.  \n\n**Optional Prompt (if you\u2019d like a little extra guidance):**  \n1.

You can also recall the \u201cstraight\u2011line\u201d proof: if you extend one side of a triangle, the exterior angle equals the sum of the two non\u2011adjacent interior angles, and together they form a straight line (180\u00b0).\n\nTake a moment, write down what you think, and let\u2019s see where the confusion might be.

That\u2019s a common guess because a full circle is 360\u00b0, but for a triangle the sum is actually **180\u00b0**.\n\n**Why 180\u00b0?**  \nIf you take any triangle and \u201cflatten\u201d one of its sides onto a straight line, the two adjacent angles plus the angle you flattened will line up to form a straight line. A straight line measures **180\u00b0**, so the three interior angles must together equal 180\u00b0.  \n\nYou already showed you understand the rule for polygons with more than three sides (the \\((n-2)\\times180\u00b0\\) formula). When you plug \\(n=3\\) into that formula you get \\((3-2)\\times180\u00b0 = 1\\times180\u00b0 = 180\u00b0\\).
