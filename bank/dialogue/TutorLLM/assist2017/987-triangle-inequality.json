We can practice them together so the process feels more automatic. |\n\n**What\u2019s next?**  \nLet\u2019s tackle a focused, bite\u2011size problem that lets you practice the triangle\u2011inequality while also brushing up on order\u2011of\u2011operations (so you\u2019ll see the connection between the two). I\u2019ll give you a hint after the question, but first try it on your own.
