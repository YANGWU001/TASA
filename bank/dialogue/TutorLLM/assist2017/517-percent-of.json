That\u2019s why the earlier probability problems felt more familiar.\n\n**What we\u2019ll do next**\n\n1. **Link the idea to something you already know** \u2013 think of \u201cpercent of\u201d as \u201chow many parts out of 100.\u201d  \n2. **Turn the word problem into a simple equation** \u2013 the unknown number of cupcakes is the \u201cwhat we\u2019re looking for.\u201d  \n3. **Practice with a very similar, but slightly simpler, situation** so you can see the steps clearly.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through the thought process together on a new problem.

Think of it as:\n\n1. **Turn the percent into a decimal** (divide by\u202f100).  \n2. **Multiply** that decimal by the number you\u2019re taking the percent of.\n\nFor example, \u201c25\u202f% of 80\u201d becomes  \n\\(25\\% = \\frac{25}{100}=0.25\\) and \\(0.25 \\times 80 = 20\\).\n\nIf you ever feel stuck, ask yourself:\n- *What does the percent mean?* (It\u2019s \u201cout of 100.\u201d)  \n- *What number am I taking that part of?* (That\u2019s the second number in the phrase.)  \n- *What operation combines them?* (It\u2019s always multiplication after the conversion.)\n\nYou can try the steps on a piece of paper or with a calculator, but the main idea is **convert \u2192 multiply**.  \n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n> **Problem:**  \n> A store is having a sale where **30\u202f% off** the regular price of a jacket.
