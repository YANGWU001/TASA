Recognizing that you\u2019re stuck tells us exactly where to focus our help.  \n\n**Why it matters:**  \n- A Venn\u2011diagram problem is essentially a **visual bookkeeping** task. It asks you to sort the given numbers into the correct regions of the diagram (only\u2011Math, only\u2011Science, both, and none).  \n- When the numbers feel abstract, it\u2019s easy to get lost, especially if you\u2019re also thinking about probability at the same time.  \n\n**What to try next time:**  \n1. **Sketch the circles first.** Draw two overlapping circles and label them \u201cMath\u201d and \u201cScience.\u201d  \n2. **Place the \u201cboth\u201d number in the overlap** (the part that belongs to the two sets simultaneously).  \n3. **Work outward** \u2013 subtract the overlap from each total to find the \u201conly\u201d sections.  \n4. **Fill in the \u201cnone\u201d region** by subtracting everything you\u2019ve placed from the total class size.  \n\nDoing these steps in order turns a \u201cbig\u2011word\u201d problem into a series of small, concrete calculations.  \n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next Practice Question (Personalized)\n\n#### \ud83d\udcca Context  \nYou\u2019ve been practicing Venn diagrams, and you\u2019ve also seen a few probability problems that didn\u2019t click.
