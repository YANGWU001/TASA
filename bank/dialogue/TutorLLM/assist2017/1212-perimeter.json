Those ideas are related because both area and perimeter involve using formulas that you need to recall and apply correctly.  \n\nFor perimeter, the key is to remember the **formula** for the shape you\u2019re working with. Since a rectangle has two lengths and two widths, the perimeter is simply:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{length}) + 2 \\times (\\text{width})\n\\]\n\nThink of \u201cwalking\u201d around the garden: you go the length, then the width, then the length again, and finally the width again. Adding those four sides gives the total distance around the shape.\n\nYou didn\u2019t know the answer this time, which is completely okay. Let\u2019s try a guided practice so you can see the steps in action.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question (with a helpful hint)\n\n**Problem:**  \nA rectangular playground has a **length of 12 meters** and a **width of 7 meters**.\n\n**Question:**  \nWhat is the perimeter of the playground?\n\n**Hint:**  \n1. Write down the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle.  \n2. Plug the given numbers (length\u202f=\u202f12\u202fm, width\u202f=\u202f7\u202fm) into the formula.  \n3.",
