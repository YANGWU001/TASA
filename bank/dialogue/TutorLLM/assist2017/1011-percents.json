Great job!  \n- **Thinking about multiplication:**\u202fYou\u2019re on the right track that you\u2019ll use the decimal somehow with the original price.\n\n**What needs a tiny tweak \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f**  \nWhen something is \u201c25\u202f% **off**,\u201d the discount **removes** 25\u202f% of the original price.  \nSo you don\u2019t multiply the price by\u202f0.25\u202f*by itself*; you multiply the price by the **portion that stays**:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Amount you pay} = \\text{Original price} \\times (1 - \\text{discount decimal})\n\\]\n\n- The \u201c1\u201d represents the whole (100\u202f%).  \n- Subtract the discount decimal (0.25) to get the part that remains:  \n\n\\[\n1 - 0.25 = 0.75\n\\]\n\n- Then multiply the original price by\u202f0.75. That gives you 75\u202f% of the original price \u2013 the amount after the 25\u202f% discount.\n\n**Why this works**  \nIf you took the original price and removed 25\u202f% of it, you\u2019re left with the other 75\u202f% (because 100\u202f%\u202f\u2013\u202f25\u202f%\u202f=\u202f75\u202f%). Converting 75\u202f% to a decimal gives 0.75, which is the factor you multiply by.\n\n**Quick check**  \nLet\u2019s say the original price is \\$80.  \n\n\\[\n\\$80 \\times 0.75 = \\$60\n\\]\n\nSo a 25\u202f% discount on \\$80 leaves you paying \\$60.  \n\nYou were *so* close\u2014just remember the \u201c1\u2011minus\u2011discount\u201d step, and you\u2019ll have the correct answer every time!\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next Practice Question  \n\n**Problem:**  \nA pair of headphones",
