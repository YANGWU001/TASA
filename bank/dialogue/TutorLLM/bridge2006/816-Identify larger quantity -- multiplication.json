The key is to figure out which product is larger **without necessarily doing the full multiplication**\u2014you can often compare the factors first.\n\nBecause you\u2019ve had trouble in the past with \u201cIdentify number of items\u201d problems, we\u2019ll practice a little counting skill together before we jump into the comparison. Let\u2019s break the process into three simple steps:\n\n1. **Read the table carefully** \u2013 note the number of rows and the number of items per row.  \n2. **Translate each situation into a multiplication sentence** (rows\u202f\u00d7\u202fitems per row).  \n3. **Compare the two products** \u2013 you can estimate, use mental math tricks, or actually calculate if the numbers are small.\n\nYou\u2019re doing the right thing by asking for help.

Here\u2019s a simple routine you can try next time:\n\n| Step | What to do | Why it helps |\n|------|------------|--------------|\n| **1. Look for a multiplication clue** | Identify any *rows* and *items per row* (or *packs* and *items per pack*). | Multiplication is the shortcut for \u201crepeated addition.\u201d |\n| **2. Write the product** | Turn the clue into an equation, e.g.,\u202f`rows \u00d7 items\u2011per\u2011row = total`. | Seeing the numbers together makes the total crystal\u2011clear. |\n| **3. Compare the totals** | Once you have both totals, ask \u201cWhich number is bigger?\u201d | The answer to the \u201clarger quantity\u201d question is simply the bigger product. |\n| **4. Check the answer** | If you have time, add the numbers the long way (e.g., 4\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f4\u202f+\u202f4) to verify your product. | This double\u2011check catches slip\u2011ups. |\n\n**Why you might have felt stuck:**  \n- The problem gave you the *structure* (rows \u00d7 plants per row) but didn\u2019t spell out the multiplication explicitly.  \n- When you see \u201crows of X\u201d it\u2019s easy to forget that the total is a product, not just a single number.\n\n**What to do next time:**  \n1. **Spot the \u201c\u00d7\u201d language** \u2013 words like *each*, *per*, *in every*, *rows of*, *packs of*, etc., are multiplication hints.  \n2. **Write it down** \u2013 even a quick scribble \u201c3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 = ?\u201d clears the mental fog",
