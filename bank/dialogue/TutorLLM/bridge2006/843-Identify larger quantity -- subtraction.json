A negative result would mean we subtracted the larger number from the smaller one, which isn\u2019t what the problem asks for. |\n\n**Why the order matters**  \nWhen a problem asks you to \u201cidentify the larger quantity and subtract,\u201d the subtraction must always be **larger\u202f\u2212\u202fsmaller**. This guarantees a non\u2011negative answer (0 or a positive number) and matches the idea of \u201chow many more\u201d one group has than the other.\n\n**A quick tip to remember the order**\n\n1. **Compare** the two numbers.  \n2. **Circle** the larger one (or say it out loud).  \n3. **Write** the subtraction sentence: *larger number*\u202f\u2013\u202f*smaller number* = ___  \n\nTry saying the steps aloud before you write the sentence\u2014it helps lock the order in your mind.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f Next Practice Question\n\nLet\u2019s try another situation with a little story.
