When a problem feels unfamiliar, saying *\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d* is a clear signal that your brain is pausing to make space for new learning.  The next step is to look at the problem a little closer and try a strategy\u2014even a tiny one\u2014before deciding you\u2019re stuck.  \n\n**Why it matters:**  \n- **Growth mindset:** Treating \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d as the start of a solution (instead of the end) helps you build confidence.  \n- **Strategic thinking:** Even a quick guess, a visual cue, or a reminder of a related fact (like a Greatest Common Factor you\u2019ve practiced before) can move you forward.  \n\n**Next time:**  \n1. **Read the question twice.** Highlight the numbers or operation that are the focus.  \n2. **Ask yourself a simple \u201cwhat\u2011if\u201d** \u2013 \u201cWhat would happen if I double one of the numbers?\u201d or \u201cDo the numbers share a factor I recognize?\u201d  \n3. **Write a quick note** (e.g., \u201ccompare sizes\u201d or \u201clook for a common factor\u201d) before you answer.  \n\nYou\u2019ve already shown you\u2019re willing to admit when you\u2019re unsure, which is a huge strength.
