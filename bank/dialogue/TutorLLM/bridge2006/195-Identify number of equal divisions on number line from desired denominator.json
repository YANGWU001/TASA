Write the number of equal divisions you created in the space provided.\n\n---\n\n**Answer format:**  \n`Number of equal divisions = ___`\n\n*(You do not need to label the fractions yet\u2014just focus on how many equal pieces the line should be split into.)*  \n\nGood luck! Remember, the denominator tells you **how many equal pieces** the whole (from\u202f0\u202fto\u202f1) should be broken into. If you get stuck, think: \u201cIf the denominator were 2, how many pieces would I need? What about 3? Use that pattern for 5.\u201d",
