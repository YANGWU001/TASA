Here are a few quick strategies you can try the next time you see a picture like this:\n\n| Strategy | How to Use It |\n|----------|---------------|\n| **Look for the \u201cticks\u201d or lines** | Every vertical line that cuts the bar is a boundary between two sections. Count the spaces **between** the lines, not the lines themselves. |\n| **Count the pieces, not the gaps** | If the bar is already drawn as separate pieces (like puzzle pieces), just count the pieces. |\n| **Use your fingers** | Point to each section with a finger or a pen as you count; it helps keep track. |\n| **Check the total length** | If the bar is labeled with a length (e.g., \u201cthe whole bar = 1\u201d) and each piece is labeled with a fraction (\u00bc, \u2153, etc.), the denominator tells you how many equal parts the whole would be divided into. |\n| **Ask \u201cIf I put a dot on each piece, how many dots would I need to fill the whole bar?\u201d** | This mental picture often makes the count clearer. |\n\nGive yourself a moment to **scan the picture first**, then apply one of the tricks above before you answer.

That kind of \u201clook\u2011and\u2011count\u201d strategy is exactly what the problem is asking you to do.  \n\nIn this particular picture the bar is actually divided into **five** equal sections, not four. Here\u2019s a quick way to see the difference:\n\n1. **Count the lines (including the ends).**  \n   - The very left edge of the bar is the first \u201cline.\u201d  \n   - Every vertical stroke you see inside the bar is another line.  \n   - The right edge of the bar is the last line.  \n\n2. **Count the spaces *between* the lines.**  \n   - The number of equal sections is the same as the number of spaces **between** the lines.  \n\nWhen you count the lines in the picture you\u2019ll find **six** vertical lines (left edge\u202f+\u202ffour interior lines\u202f+\u202fright edge).

The missing piece here is just remembering to look at the *gaps* rather than the lines themselves.\n\n**How to move forward**\n\n- **Visual cue:** When you see a picture with several vertical lines, try drawing a tiny dot in each gap.
