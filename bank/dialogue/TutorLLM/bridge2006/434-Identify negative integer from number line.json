That\u2019s completely okay\u2014recognizing where the negatives live on a line takes a little practice.  \n\nHere are a few quick reminders that will help you the next time you look at a number line:\n\n| Concept | What to Look For |\n|---------|-----------------|\n| **Zero** | The \u201ccenter\u201d point. Everything to the **left** of zero is negative, everything to the **right** is positive. |\n| **Direction** | Numbers get **smaller** as you move left (\u20111, \u20112, \u20113 \u2026) and **bigger** as you move right (1, 2, 3 \u2026). |\n| **Labels** | If a point is labeled with a minus sign (\u2011) **or** is placed left of 0, it\u2019s a negative integer. |\n| **Spacing** | On a typical evenly\u2011spaced line, each tick represents a step of\u202f1. Count the steps from 0 to the point you\u2019re checking. |\n\n**What went well:** You recognized that you needed more help\u2014asking for clarification is the first step toward mastering any skill.\n\n**What to work on next:**  \n1. **Visual scan** \u2013 When you see a number line, first locate the 0 mark.  \n2. **Left\u2011right rule** \u2013 Anything left of that 0 is negative.  \n3. **Check the label** \u2013 Make sure the number actually has a \u201c\u2011\u201d in front of it; sometimes a point may be left of ",

That means the idea is **in your toolbox**; it just needs a little more practice to become automatic.\n\n**A quick reminder:**  \n- On a horizontal number line, **zero** is the middle point.  \n- Numbers **to the left of zero** are **negative** (\u20111, \u20112, \u20113, \u2026).  \n- Numbers **to the right of zero** are **positive** (1,\u202f2,\u202f3, \u2026).  \n\nWhen you look at a number line, ask yourself: *\u201cIs this point left or right of zero?\u201d* If it\u2019s left, it\u2019s a negative integer.\n\n**Try this tip now:**  \n1.

Great job writing out your thinking out loud \u2013 that\u2019s exactly how mathematicians work.  \n\n**What you nailed \u2705**  \n- You remembered the most important rule: *anything left of 0 on the number line is negative.*  \n- You correctly identified the point **two ticks left of 0** as **\u20112**. That\u2019s spot\u2011on!  \n\n**Where you can sharpen the skill \ud83d\udd27**  \n- **Counting the ticks**: each little tick (or \u201chash mark\u201d) on a typical whole\u2011number number line represents **one unit**. So the first tick left of 0 is \u20111, the second is \u20112, the third is \u20113, and so on.  \n- **Double\u2011checking**: after you count, it can help to say the answer out loud (\u201c\u20112\u201d) and then glance back at the line to confirm that the label matches the position.  \n\n**A quick tip to make counting easier**  \n1. **Mark the zero** in your mind (or with a tiny \u201c\u2713\u201d).  \n2. **Take a finger** (or a mental \u201cstep\u201d)",

Each tick you pass changes the number by\u202f\u20111.  \n3. **Stop when you reach the point you\u2019re asked about.** The number you\u2019ve counted down to is the integer you need.  \n\nYou\u2019ve already mastered the rule (\u201cleft\u202f=\u202fnegative\u201d), so the next step is just a little practice with counting.
