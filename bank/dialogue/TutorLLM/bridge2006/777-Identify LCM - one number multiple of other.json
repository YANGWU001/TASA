I\u2019m not totally sure why 8 can\u2019t be the LCM.\u201d\n\n**What you got right**  \n- You remembered the key rule: **when one number is a multiple of the other, the LCM is the larger number.**  \n- You correctly identified that 24\u202f>\u202f8, so you chose 24 as the answer.\n\n**What still needs a little more clarity**  \n- **Why the smaller number (8) can\u2019t be the LCM.**  \n  The LCM must be a *common multiple* of **both** numbers.  \n  8 is a multiple of 8, but it is **not** a multiple of 24 (24\u202f\u00f7\u202f8 = 3, which is an integer, but we need a number that 24 can *divide into* without remainder). In other words, 8 does **not** go into 24 evenly the other way around\u201424 cannot be expressed as \u201c8\u202f\u00d7\u202fsomething\u201d with an integer \u201csomething\u201d that makes 8 a multiple of 24.  \n\n- **Think of it like a \u201cmeeting point.\u201d**  \n  Imagine the two numbers are runners on a track. One runner (24) takes bigger steps, the other (8) takes smaller steps. They will first meet at the point where both have completed a whole number of steps. The runner who takes the bigger steps will reach that meeting point later, so the first common spot they share is 24, not 8.\n\n**Bottom line:**  \n- 24\u202f\u00f7\u202f8 = 3 \u2192 24 is a multiple of 8.  \n- 8\u202f\u00f7\u202f24 is **not** an integer \u2192 8 is **not** a multiple of 24.  \nTherefore the *least* common multiple that works for **both** numbers is 24.\n\nGreat",
