So the smallest size that works for both groups is 18.\n\n**Let\u2019s try another one together.** I\u2019ll walk you through the steps, and then you\u2019ll get a chance to solve a similar problem on your own.\n\n---\n\n### Guided Example  \n\n**Find the LCM of 4 and 20.**\n\n1. **Check if one number is a multiple of the other.**  \n   - Does 20 \u00f7 4 give a whole number? 20 \u00f7 4 = 5 \u2192 **Yes",
