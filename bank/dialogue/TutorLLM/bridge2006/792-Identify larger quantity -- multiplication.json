Compare the numbers in each expression one\u2011by\u2011one. |\n| **Same factor trick** | When the two products share a common factor, you only need to compare the *other* factor. For example, \\(4 \\times 7\\) vs. \\(4 \\times 9\\) \u2192 the 4\u2019s are the same, so the product with the larger second number (9) is larger. |\n| **Estimate** | Round each factor to a \u201cnice\u201d number (like 10, 20, 50) and multiply the estimates. The estimate that\u2019s clearly bigger will usually point to the larger actual product. |\n| **Use area models** | Think of each multiplication as the area of a rectangle. A rectangle that\u2019s longer or taller (or both) will have a larger area. |\n\nWhen you feel stuck, try **one** of those strategies first before you dive into the exact multiplication. It\u2019s a great way to build confidence",
