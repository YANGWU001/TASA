The only slip was picking the wrong \u201clarger\u201d number first. Because the subtraction was done correctly, the difference is still 15. |\n\n**What this tells us**\n\n- You know how to subtract once the correct numbers are identified (the 15 is spot\u2011on!).  \n- The tricky part for you right now is *choosing* the larger quantity before you subtract. That\u2019s why we\u2019ll focus more on that skill in the next practice.\n\n**Let\u2019s try again together**\n\nBefore you calculate the difference, pause and ask yourself: \u201cWhich number is bigger?\u201d\u202f\u2192\u202fpoint to the larger one, then subtract the smaller from it.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question \u2013 Identify the Larger Quantity and Subtract\n\n**Scenario:**  \nLiam is organizing his baseball cards.

Because you chose 58 as the \u201clarger\u201d number, the subtraction you wrote would have been 58\u202f\u2013\u202f73, which would give a negative answer (\u201115) and isn\u2019t what the problem asks for. |\n\n**What this tells us**\n\n- You *know* how to subtract the two numbers (you got the right difference), which is great!  \n- The remaining hurdle is **recognizing which quantity is larger before you subtract**.  \n- This is a common stumbling point\u2014your earlier work on \u201cIdentify larger quantity \u2013 addition\u201d and the bar\u2011drawing tasks shows you\u2019re building the right habits; we just need a little more practice linking the visual/mental comparison to the subtraction step.\n\n**How to improve**\n\n1. **Compare the numbers first** \u2013 Look at the tens and then the ones.  \n   - 73 has a \u201c7\u201d in the tens place, 58 has a \u201c5\u201d.
