Look at the numbers** | Identify the tens and ones places. | The tens place usually decides the size of the sum. |\n| **2. Round each addend** | Round to the nearest ten (or to the nearest\u202f5 if that feels easier). | Rounding makes the numbers simpler and the comparison faster. |\n| **3. Add the rounded numbers** | Do the quick mental addition. | You now have two *estimates* of the sums. |\n| **4. Compare the estimates** | The larger estimate usually means the larger actual sum. | If the estimates are far apart, you can be confident in your answer. |\n| **5. Double\u2011check when needed** | If the estimates are close (within 5\u201310), add the original numbers to be sure. | This avoids a rare mistake when rounding hides a small difference. |\n\nYou\u2019ve already tried step\u202f2 with the examples you gave, so let\u2019s give it another go!  \n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question\n\n**Which of the following sums is larger?**  \nUse the rounding\u2011estimate strategy we discussed.
