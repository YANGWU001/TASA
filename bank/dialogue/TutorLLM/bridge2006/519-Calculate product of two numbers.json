If a digit is omitted, the partial products will be off. | Write the numbers vertically, aligning the units column. Example: <br>```\\n  14  \u2190 multiplicand (top)\\n\u00d7  9  \u2190 multiplier (bottom)\\n``` |\n| **No partial product shown** | Multiplying a two\u2011digit number by a one\u2011digit number still requires a single partial product, but you must still multiply each digit and write the result in the proper place. | Multiply the units digit of the top number by the bottom digit, write the result under the line, then multiply the tens digit and write its product shifted one place to the left. |\n| **No final addition step** | Even when there is only one partial product, the algorithm expects you to write the final answer beneath the line. This reinforces the \u201cadd\u2011up\u201d idea that will be crucial when you later multiply two\u2011digit numbers by two\u2011digit numbers. | After you have the partial product(s), draw a",
