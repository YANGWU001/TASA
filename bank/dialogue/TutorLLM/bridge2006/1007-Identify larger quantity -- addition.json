If you\u2019re not comfortable with the addition part, it\u2019s hard to make the comparison.\n\nHere are two quick reminders that usually help:\n\n| Step | What to do | Why it helps |\n|------|------------|--------------|\n| **1. Add each pair separately** | Write the numbers one under the other and add them column\u2011by\u2011column (units, tens, etc.). | Keeps the arithmetic organized and reduces mistakes. |\n| **2. Check your sum** | If you have a \u201ccarry\u201d (e.g., 9\u202f+\u202f8\u202f=\u202f17), write the 7 in the units place and carry the 1 to the tens column. | Guarantees the total is correct before you compare. |\n| **3. Compare the two totals** | You can either (a) look at the highest place value (hundreds, then tens, then ones) or (b) subtract the smaller total from the larger one. The sign of the difference tells you which is bigger. | Using subtraction is a shortcut you already practiced when you worked on \u201ccalculate difference.\u201d |\n\nSince you\u2019ve had trouble with \u201ccalculate difference \u2013 non\u2011contextual\u201d before, try **step\u202f3** as a mini\u2011review: after you find the two sums, subtract the smaller from the larger. If the result is positive, you know which one is larger; if it\u2019s zero, the totals are the same.\n\n",

The only extra piece is the comparison step. When you finish the additions, just ask yourself: *\u201cWhich of these two numbers is larger?\u201d* If you\u2019re not sure, you can line the numbers up vertically or use a number line to see which one sits farther to the right.\n\n**Let\u2019s practice together** \u2013 I\u2019ll give you a new pair of addition problems.

In other words, after you add, you can **compare** the two totals by seeing which one is bigger.\n\n**What to try next**\n\n1. **Add the numbers in each pair** \u2013 treat it just like any simple addition fact you already know.  \n2. **Write down both totals** side\u2011by\u2011side.  \n3. **Compare**: which number is bigger?
