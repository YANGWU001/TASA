That\u2019s completely understandable\u2014without the numbers it\u2019s impossible to decide which sum is bigger.  \n\nHere\u2019s what we can do when a problem looks like that:\n\n1. **Ask for the missing information** (just like you did).  \n2. **Write the numbers down** so you can see them clearly.  \n3. **Add each pair of numbers** (or use a quick mental\u2011math trick).  \n4. **Compare the two totals** and choose the larger one.\n\nYou already took the first step by asking for the numbers, which is a great habit. In the next practice round I\u2019ll make sure the numbers are visible right away, so you can focus on the addition and the comparison.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Next Practice Question \u2013 Identify the Larger Quantity (Addition)\n\nBelow are two separate addition problems. **Read each problem carefully, add the two numbers, and then tell me which problem (A or B) has the larger total.** Write the letter of the problem with the bigger sum.\n\n| Problem | Numbers to Add |\n|---------|----------------|\n| **A**   | 27\u202f+\u202f14 |\n| **B**   | 35\u202f+\u202f5  |\n\n**Your answer:** ___ (A or B)  \n\n*If you\u2019d like, you can also write the two sums you calculated before picking the larger one.*\n\n---\n\n### Quick Reminder: How to Compare Two Sums\n\n1. **Add each pair** \u2013 you can do it on paper, in your head, or using a mental shortcut.  \n   - Example: 27\u202f+\u202f14 \u2192 27\u202f+\u202f10\u202f=\u202f37, then +4\u202f=\u202f41.  \n   - Example: 35\u202f+\u202f5 \u2192 35\u202f+\u202f5\u202f",

That\u2019s exactly the strategy we want you to use when the answer isn\u2019t obvious.\n\n**What went well**\n- You wrote out the addition for Problem\u202fA (even though the numbers weren\u2019t shown in the table, you still tried to work with what you had).  \n- You gave a clear answer (\u201c**B** is bigger\u201d) and explained that you \u201ctried adding them.\u201d  \n\n**Where we can improve**\n- Because the numbers for A and B didn\u2019t appear in the table, it was hard to be certain you were adding the correct values. In future problems, make sure you **copy the numbers from the picture or table onto a separate line** before you start adding. This eliminates any \u201cmissing\u2011number\u201d confusion.\n- After you finish the addition, it\u2019s helpful to **double\u2011check your work** (e.g., add the numbers in the opposite order or use an estimate) before committing to A or B. That extra check can boost your confidence and accuracy.\n\n**Next step:** Let\u2019s practice a fresh problem where the numbers are clearly shown, and we\u2019ll walk through the whole adding\u2011and\u2011comparing process together.  \n\n---\n\n## \u25b6\ufe0f Practice Question \u2013 \u201cWhich Total Is Bigger?\u201d\n\nBelow are two simple \u201cbuckets\u201d of numbers. **Add the numbers in each bucket** and tell me which bucket has the larger total.
