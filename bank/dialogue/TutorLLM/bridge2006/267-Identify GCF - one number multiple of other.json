You correctly identified that **6** is a factor of both 12 and 36, which shows you understand what a *common factor* is. \ud83c\udf89  \n\nHowever, the question asked for the **greatest** common factor (GCF). When one number is a multiple of the other, the GCF is simply the *smaller* number, because the smaller number divides itself and also divides the larger number exactly.\n\n- 12\u202f=\u202f12\u202f\u00d7\u202f1  \n- 36\u202f=\u202f12\u202f\u00d7\u202f3  \n\nSince 12 divides both numbers, **12** is the greatest common factor\u2014not 6.

Recognizing a *common factor* is an important first step, and you nailed it. \ud83c\udf89  \n\nThe question, however, asked for the **greatest** common factor (the GCF). Because **36 is a multiple of 12** (\u202f36\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f12\u202f), every factor of 12 is automatically a factor of 36. That means the *largest* number that divides both of them is actually **12**, not 6.\n\n**Why 12 is the GCF**\n\n| Factor | Divides 12? | Divides 36? |\n|--------|------------|------------|\n| 1      | \u2705          | \u2705          |\n| 2      | \u2705          | \u2705          |\n| 3      | \u2705          | \u2705          |\n| 4      | \u2705          | \u2705          |\n| 6      | \u2705          | \u2705          |\n| **12** | \u2705          | \u2705          |\n\nAll the numbers above are common factors, and **12** is the biggest one on the list, so it\u2019s the GCF.\n\n**What might have caused the confusion?**\n\n- When one number is a *multiple* of the other, the smaller number itself is always the GCF.  \n- It\u2019s easy to stop at the first common factor you notice (like 6) instead of checking whether a larger one exists.\n\n**Let\u2019s practice the same idea a little more**",
