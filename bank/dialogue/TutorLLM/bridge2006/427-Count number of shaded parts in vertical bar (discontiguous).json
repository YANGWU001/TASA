Here are a few quick tricks that many students find helpful:\n\n| Strategy | How to Use It |\n|----------|----------------|\n| **\u201cMark\u2011as\u2011you\u2011go\u201d** | As you count down, tap your finger on each rectangle you examine. When you see a shaded one, give yourself a small \u201chigh\u2011five\u201d (or say \u201cshaded!\u201d) to reinforce the count. |\n| **\u201cTop\u2011to\u2011bottom checklist\u201d** | Write a short list on a scrap paper: 1\ufe0f\u20e3\u202f\u25a1\u202f2\ufe0f\u20e3\u202f\u25a1\u202f3\ufe0f\u20e3\u202f\u25a1\u202f\u2026\u202f8\ufe0f\u20e3\u202f\u25a1. Put a check\u2011mark next to any number that is shaded. When you\u2019re done, just count the checks. |\n| **\u201cChunk it\u201d** | If the bar has many rectangles, group them into pairs or triples in your mind (e.g., \u201cfirst two,\u201d \u201cnext three\u201d). Then you only need to remember whether each group contains a shaded block. |\n| **\u201cVisual cue\u201d** | Imagine a tiny dot or a colored sticker that you could \u201cplace\u201d on each shaded block in your mind. The dot helps you see the pattern without having to remember the exact positions. |\n\nTry using",
