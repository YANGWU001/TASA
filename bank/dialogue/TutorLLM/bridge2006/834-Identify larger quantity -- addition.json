When a problem asks you to decide which of two addition expressions is larger, the key is to **compare the totals** without having to do every single addition step in your head.\n\nHere are a couple of quick strategies you can try next time:\n\n| Strategy | How It Helps |\n|----------|--------------|\n| **Round\u2011and\u2011compare** | Look at the numbers, round each to the nearest ten (or hundred) and compare the rounded totals. If the rounded totals are far apart, you already know which one is bigger. |\n| **Break it apart** | Add the numbers in each expression in small, easy groups (e.g., add the tens first, then the ones). This keeps the mental math light. |\n| **Spot the \u201cbiggest\u201d number** | Often the expression that contains the single largest addend will end up larger, especially if the other addends are similar. |\n| **Use a quick estimate** | If you see something like 48\u202f+\u202f27 vs. 30\u202f+\u202f20, you can estimate 48\u202f\u2248\u202f50, 27\u202f\u2248\u202f30 \u2192 80 vs. 50 \u2192 the first is larger. |\n\nGive those a try on the next problem, and you\u2019ll start to feel more confident about spotting the larger sum quickly. You\u2019ve already shown you can identify the larger quantity when the numbers are obvious (you got the \u201cExpression\u202fA\u201d question right!), so it\u2019s just a matter of building the same habit for trickier pairs.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Which expression has the larger total?**\n\n| Expression A | Expression B |\n|--------------|--------------|\n|  **A:** ",
