Being able to spot that the numbers are close and still decide correctly shows you\u2019re developing good estimation skills.\n\n**A quick tip for confidence:**  \nWhen the two products are close, compare the *factors* first.  \n- The larger factor in one pair (here 7\u202fvs\u202f5) usually gives the bigger product, *unless* the other factor is dramatically smaller.  \n- In this case, the other factors are 6 and 8, which are fairly close, so the larger first factor (7) wins.\n\nYou\u2019re on the right track!

Spot the bigger factor** | Identify which pair has the larger *first* number **and** the larger *second* number. | If one pair wins on *both* factors, its product is definitely larger. |\n| **3. Use estimation** | If each pair wins on a different factor, estimate:  \\(\\text{larger factor} \\times \\text{roughly the same size}\\). For example, \\(9 \\times 4\\) is close to \\(10 \\times 4 = 40\\). | Estimating gives you a sense of magnitude without doing the exact multiplication. |\n| **4. Check quickly** | If you\u2019re still unsure, do the small multiplication (the one with the smaller numbers) first\u2014 it\u2019s faster and often enough to decide which product is bigger. | A quick calculation can confirm your intuition. |\n\n**What you did well:**  \n- You recognized that a bigger first number often means a bigger product.
