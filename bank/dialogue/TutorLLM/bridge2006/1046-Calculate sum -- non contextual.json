When a problem feels new or tricky, it\u2019s normal to pause and feel uncertain.

This can shrink the work quickly. | Look for numbers that are opposites or that add to a multiple of 10. |\n| **Think of a number line** | Visualizing jumps left (negative) and right (positive) can make the process feel concrete. | Start at 0, move left\u202f8, then right\u202f15, etc. |\n| **Check your work with a quick mental estimate** | If your final answer seems far off from what you expected, you can spot a slip early. | After you finish, ask: \u201cIf I added all the positives I got about ___ and all the negatives about ___, does the final number make sense?\u201d |\n\nYou also had a",

It forces you to keep track of each sign, which is exactly what you need when the numbers are mixed.  \n- **Looking for cancelling pairs** \u2013 Spotting that\u202f+7 and\u202f\u20117 \u201cwipe each other out\u201d is a powerful shortcut. It reduces the amount of arithmetic you have to do and helps you stay organized.  \n\n**A tiny refinement**  \nYou don\u2019t *have* to write the negatives **before** the positives every time; the order doesn\u2019t affect the final sum. What matters most is that each sign is recorded correctly. Some students find it easier to list all positives first, then all negatives, while others prefer to keep the original order but colour\u2011code the signs. Feel free to experiment and keep the method that feels fastest for you.\n\n**Next step**  \nTry combining the two ideas you mentioned:  \n\n1. **Group** all the positives together and add them.  \n2. **Group** all the negatives together (you can add their absolute values, then put the minus sign back).  \n3. **Look for any exact opposites** that cancel out before you do the two big additions.  \n\nYou\u2019re already on the right track\u2014keep using the \u201c",
