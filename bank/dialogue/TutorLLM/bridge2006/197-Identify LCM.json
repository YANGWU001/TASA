Think of it as the first \u201cmeeting point\u201d on the number\u2011line where the two counting rhythms line up.\n\n2. **Why is it useful?**  \n   - It tells you the smallest size of a collection that can be split into equal groups of each size.  \n   - It\u2019s the \u201cleast\u201d number of items you could have so that you could arrange them in rows of 4 *and* rows of 6 without leftovers.\n\n3. **A quick method (the \u201clist\u2011multiples\u201d approach)**  \n   - Write a short list of multiples for each number.  \n   - Scan the lists for the first number that appears in **both** lists. That number is the LCM.\n\n   Example with 4 and 6:  \n   - Multiples of 4 \u2192 4,\u202f8,\u202f12,\u202f16,\u202f20,\u202f\u2026  \n   - Multiples of 6 \u2192 6,\u202f12,\u202f18,\u202f24,\u202f\u2026  \n   The first common entry is **12**, so",

What is an LCM?\nThe *least common multiple* (LCM) of two numbers is **the smallest positive number that both original numbers divide into evenly** (i.e., with no remainder).\n\n- **Multiple**\u202f\u2192\u202fa number you get *by multiplying* the original number (e.g., multiples of 4 are 4,\u202f8,\u202f12,\u202f16,\u202f\u2026).\n- **Factor**\u202f\u2192\u202fa number that *divides* the original number (e.g., factors of 12 are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f12).\n\nBecause you\u2019ve had a little trouble distinguishing factors from multiples before, keep this wording in mind: *\u201cFactor = divides\u201d; \u201cMultiple = gets multiplied.\u201d*  \n\n---\n\n### 2.
