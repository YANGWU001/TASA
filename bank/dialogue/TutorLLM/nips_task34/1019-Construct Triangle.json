That\u2019s the right way to begin \u2013 every triangle construction starts with a known element (a point, a segment, an angle, etc.).\n\n**What\u2019s missing**  \n- **Complete the base segment.** After you put point\u202f\\(A\\) you need a second point (let\u2019s call it\u202f\\(B\\)) and a straight line\u202f\\(AB\\) of the required length.  \n- **State the given condition.** The problem you were given (the \u201ccondition\u201d) hasn\u2019t been written out in your notes. Knowing exactly what is prescribed (e.g., a side length, an angle, a radius) tells you which tools you\u2019ll use next.  \n- **Use the compass and straight\u2011edge.** After the base is drawn, the next steps usually involve:  \n  1. Setting a compass width (for a side length or radius).  \n  2. Swinging arcs from the base endpoints.  \n  3. Intersecting arcs to locate the third vertex\u202f\\(C\\).  \n- **Explain each action.** In a full construction you would write a short justification for each step (e.g., \u201cDraw an arc with radius 5\u202fcm centered at\u202f\\(A\\) to locate all points that are 5\u202fcm from\u202f\\(A\\).\u201d) This shows you understand *why* you are doing it, not just *how*.\n\n**How",
