If yes, divide 84 by 2 and write down a 2.\n\n2. **Keep dividing by the smallest prime that still works.**  \n   After each division, ask yourself \u201cIs the new quotient still even?\u202fIf so, divide by 2 again.\u201d\n\n3. **When the number is no longer even, move to the next prime (3, then 5, then 7, \u2026).**  \n   Continue until the final quotient is 1.\n\n---\n\n### Example format for your answer  \nIf the prime factors were, say, 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5, you would write:\n\n```\n84 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7\n```\n\n(Replace the numbers with the correct factors for 84.)\n\n---\n\nGive it a try, and when you\u2019re ready, let me know your answer or any step where you get stuck! \ud83d\ude80",

If the length and width are whole numbers, their prime factors can help you find possible side\u2011length pairs that give a specific perimeter.  \n4. **Talk It Out** \u2013 Even if you\u2019re not sure, try saying the steps out loud or writing a quick \u201cguess\u2011and\u2011check\u201d list.

The \u201cI\u2019m not totally sure\u201d part tells me we need to tighten up two things:\n\n1. **What the perimeter actually tells us** \u2013 it\u2019s the *total* distance around the shape, so for a rectangle it\u2019s \\(2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\\).  \n2. **How to use that total to find the side lengths** \u2013 this is where **factor pairs** (and eventually **prime factors**) come in handy.\n\nBecause you\u2019ve been practicing perimeter problems and we know prime numbers and prime factors are a growth area for you, let\u2019s connect the two ideas. When you have a perimeter value, you can look at **all the factor pairs** of half that perimeter (since \\(2(\\ell + w) = P\\) \u21d2 \\(\\ell + w = P/2\\)). Those factor pairs are built from the number\u2019s prime factors, so practicing prime factorization will directly help you solve perimeter puzzles faster.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Mini\u2011Review: Prime Factors & Factor Pairs\n\n",
