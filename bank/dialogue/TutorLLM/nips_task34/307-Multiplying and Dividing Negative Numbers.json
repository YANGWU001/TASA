That\u2019s exactly the right approach:\u202fhandle the multiplication **first**, then move on to the division.\n\nA couple of quick points to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Sign Rule for Multiplication** \u2013 When you multiply a negative number by a positive number, the product is **negative**.  \n   \\[\n   (-7)\\times 6 = -42\n   \\]\n\n2. **Writing the Product Clearly** \u2013 It helps to write the result as a complete number (\u201142) before moving on. This prevents any \u201c\u2011\u2011\u201d confusion later.\n\n3. **Next Step \u2013 Division** \u2013 Now you\u2019ll take that product (\u201142) and divide it by \\(-2\\). Remember: **a negative divided by a negative gives a positive**.\n\nSo the full solution looks like this:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(-7 \\times 6)}{-2}\n= \\frac{-42}{-2}\n= 21\n\\]\n\nIf you write each line on its own, it\u2019s easy to track where the signs are coming from. You were on the right track\u2014just be sure to finish the multiplication and then apply the division rule.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question (Personalized)\n\nSince you\u2019ve been working on negative\u2011number operations, let\u2019s add a tiny twist that also touches on one of your earlier challenges",
