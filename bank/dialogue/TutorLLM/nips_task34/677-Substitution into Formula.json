That honesty is exactly what helps you move forward.\n\nHere are a few quick pointers that often clear up the remaining confusion:\n\n| What\u2019s tripping you up? | Why it happens | Quick fix |\n|--------------------------|----------------|-----------|\n| **Finding the right place for the numbers** | The symbols in a formula can look similar (e.g., *r* for radius vs. *R* for resistance). | Write the formula on a separate line, then underline each symbol you\u2019ll replace. |\n| **Keeping track of units** | Switching between meters, centimeters, seconds, etc., can make the final answer look \u201coff.\u201d | Write the unit next to each number you plug in; after you finish, check that the units cancel correctly. |\n| **Remembering the order of operations** | Substituting a fraction or a negative number can change the sign or magnitude if you forget parentheses. | Always surround the whole substituted value with parentheses: e.g., if *v = 2\u03c0r*, and *r = 3/4*, write *v = 2\u03c0\u202f(3/4)*. |\n| **Mix\u2011up between the variable you\u2019re solving for and the one you\u2019re given** | It\u2019s easy to plug the unknown back into the formula by mistake. | Before you start, write down: \u201cKnown: \u2026\u202f\u202fWanted: \u2026\u201d.
