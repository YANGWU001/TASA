Your guess of **5.0** is more than a whole unit low. Because the estimate must be *close* to the actual value (usually within 0.1\u20130.2 for a \u201cnearest tenth\u201d question), 5.0 does not meet that standard. | After you locate the two perfect\u2011square \u201cbrackets\u201d (6\u00b2\u202f=\u202f36 and 7\u00b2\u202f=\u202f49), think about **how far** 45 is from each. It\u2019s 9 above 36 and only 4 below 49, so \u221a45 is **closer to 7 than to 6**. A quick linear interpolation gives: <br>\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u221a45 \u2248 ",
