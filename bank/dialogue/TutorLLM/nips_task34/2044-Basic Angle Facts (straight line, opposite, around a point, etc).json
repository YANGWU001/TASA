(That\u2019s the vertical angle.)  \n- What are the two angles that sit on the same straight line as the 70\u00b0 angle? (Those two together must be 180\u00b0.)\n\nKeeping those facts in mind will let you fill in the missing measures quickly. Let\u2019s try another problem that lets you apply exactly those ideas.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question \u2013 \u201cAngle Facts in a Clock\u201d\n\nA clock shows the time **3:00**.
