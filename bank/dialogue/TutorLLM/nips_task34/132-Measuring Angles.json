When you place the protractor, line up the **zero line** with the baseline, then read the number where the second ray crosses the scale.  \n- **Check the direction of the numbers:** Most protractors have two scales (0\u00b0\u2013180\u00b0 on the inner side and 180\u00b0\u20130\u00b0 on the outer side). Make sure you\u2019re reading the **inner (0\u00b0\u2011180\u00b0) scale** unless the problem tells you otherwise.  \n- **Compare your estimate:** If you\u2019re unsure, first give a rough guess (like you did) and then **measure** to see how close you were.

That is exactly right! The vertex is the middle letter of the angle name, so **\u2220AOB** has vertex **O**. |\n| **You\u2019re thinking about the protractor\u2019s hole** \u2013 Trying to place the hole on the vertex shows you understand that the hole is the \u201cpivot point\u201d of the tool. |\n| **You asked a specific question about the baseline** \u2013 Recognizing that the baseline matters is a great sign; it means you\u2019re ready to refine the details. |\n\n**Where the confusion is**  \n1. **Which side is the baseline?**  \n   *The baseline (or \u201creference side\u201d) is the side you line up with the **zero\u2011degree mark** on the protractor. It is **not** the side with the arrow. The arrow on a protractor simply shows the direction of increasing degrees (clockwise for most school\u2011protractors).*\n\n2. **How to line up the protractor**  \n   *Place the **hole** over the vertex **O**. Then rotate the protractor until the **baseline** (one of the two rays of the angle) exactly coincides with the **0\u2011degree line** on the protractor. The other ray will point somewhere between 0\u00b0 and 180\u00b0, and the number you read at that intersection is the measure of the angle.*\n\n3. **What to do with the second ray**  \n   *After the baseline is aligned, look where the second ray (the one without the arrow) crosses the numbered scale. That crossing point tells you the angle\u2019s size. If the ray falls on the \u201cinner\u201d side of the protractor, read the numbers from the inner scale; if it falls on the \u201couter\u201d side, read the opposite scale.*\n\n**Why the arrow can be misleading**  \n-",

Recognizing that the little arrow matters is a great first step because it tells you where the \u201czero\u201d line is. | **Link the arrow to the vertex of the angle** \u2013 the arrow tells you where the protractor\u2019s 0\u00b0 line starts, and that line must line up with one side of the angle **starting at the vertex**. If the arrow isn\u2019t lined up with the vertex, the measurement you read will be off. |\n| **You\u2019re thinking about how the tool works** \u2013 that shows you\u2019re trying to understand the process, not just guessing. | **Practice aligning the protractor** \u2013 the next time you measure, place the protractor so that the **center hole** sits exactly on the vertex, the **baseline** (the straight edge) lines up with one side of the angle, and the **arrow** points to the 0\u2011degree mark. Then read the number where the other side of the angle meets the scale. |\n\n**Why the arrow matters**  \n- The arrow (or the little \u201cbase line\u201d with a 0\u00b0 mark) tells the protractor where the measurement starts.  \n- If the arrow is not pointing at the vertex, the numbers on the protractor are shifted, and you\u2019ll read a larger or smaller angle than the one you actually have.  \n\n**Next step:** Try a quick \u201chands\u2011on\u201d (or virtual) exercise: draw a simple angle on a piece of paper, place a protractor, and **describe** in one sentence how you positioned the arrow, the center hole, and the baseline before reading the angle.

After you\u2019ve aligned the baseline, decide whether you need the \u201cinner\u201d or \u201couter\u201d scale (usually the one that starts at 0 at the arrow).
