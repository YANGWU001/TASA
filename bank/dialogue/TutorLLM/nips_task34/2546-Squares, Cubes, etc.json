Here are a few strengths I noticed, plus a couple of tiny tweaks that can make your strategy even sharper:\n\n| What You Did Well | Why It Helps |\n|-------------------|--------------|\n| **1. Identified what\u2019s given** \u2013 you wrote down any numbers that are already squares or cubes. | Spotting the \u201cknown\u201d pieces saves mental energy and prevents you from reinventing the wheel. |\n| **2. Looked for patterns** \u2013 you thought about sequences like 4,\u202f9,\u202f16 or 1,\u202f8,\u202f27. | Recognizing patterns is the fastest way to predict the next term or to see if a number fits the rule. |\n| **3. Did the easy calculations first** \u2013 you squared or cubed the small numbers you\u2019re confident about. | Working from the simplest calculations reduces error and builds confidence for the tougher steps. |\n\n### A Couple of Quick Tweaks\n\n1. **Write the \u201crule\u201d explicitly.**  \n   After you notice a pattern, jot down the rule in words or algebraic form (e.g., \u201ceach term is the square of consecutive integers: \\(n^2\\) for \\(n=2,3,4,\\dots\\)\u201d). This makes it easier to verify later steps.\n\n2. **Check the reverse direction.**  \n   When you have a target number, ask yourself: \u201cIs this number a perfect square or cube?\u201d You can do a quick mental check by estimating the root (e.g., \\(50^2 = 2500\\); so a number near 2500 is likely a square of something close to 50). This helps you confirm or discard possibilities.\n\n3. **Link to mental multiplication/division.**  \n   Squaring and cubing often involve multiplying the same number repeatedly.
