That\u2019s completely okay \u2013\u202fthe first step in learning anything new is recognizing when you need a little more help.  \n\nHere are a few things to keep in mind, especially since you\u2019ve mentioned some trouble in the past with:\n\n| Past difficulty | How it relates to today\u2019s problem |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Ordering negative numbers** | When we distribute the 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(\u2026) you\u2019ll get a **\u20118** term. Being comfortable placing that negative correctly will make the rest of the work smoother. |\n| **Writing expressions** | After you combine the like terms, you\u2019ll rewrite the expression in its simplest \u201cclean\u201d form (e.g.,\u202f`7x \u2013 8`). Think of it as a short\u2011answer version of what you already know how to write. |\n| **Time problems** | Those often required you to break a story into separate pieces (minutes, hours, etc.). Here we\u2019ll break the algebraic expression into separate pieces (terms) and then put the matching pieces together. |\n\n**What to do next**\n\n1. **Take a deep breath** \u2013 you\u2019ve got the tools; you just need a little practice applying them.  \n2. **Look at the expression piece\u2011by\u2011piece.**  \n   - First, handle the part inside the parentheses.  \n   - Then, distribute the 2.  \n   - Finally, collect the terms that have the same variable (the \u201clike terms\u201d).  \n3. **Write each step on paper** (or type it out). Seeing the work in front of you makes it much easier to spot where the negatives go and how the terms combine.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, try doing the first two steps now and let me know what you get.
