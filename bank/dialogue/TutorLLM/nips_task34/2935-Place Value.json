That\u2019s completely okay\u2014recognizing that you\u2019re not 100\u202f% sure is the first step toward figuring it out.\n\nLet\u2019s finish the thought together:\n\n1. **Identify the place** \u2013 Look at the number\u202f4,582 from left to right:  \n   - 4 is in the **thousands** place  \n   - **5** is in the **hundreds** place  \n   - 8 is in the **tens** place  \n   - 2 is in the **ones** place  \n\n2. **Translate the place to a value** \u2013 The hundreds place means \u201chow many hundreds.\u201d  \n   - So the digit\u202f5 in the hundreds place represents **5\u202f\u00d7\u202f100 = 500**.\n\nIf you had written \u201c500\u201d (or said \u201cfive hundred\u201d), you\u2019d be exactly right! \ud83c\udf1f\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question \u2013 Place Value (with a tiny twist)\n\nBecause you\u2019ve also been working on **adding and subtracting negative numbers**, let\u2019s combine the ideas a little.

Write the number out with commas separating each place: **\u20112,317** \u2192 thousands, hundreds, tens, ones.  \n2. Which place does the 3 occupy?  \n3.
