That\u2019s totally fine \u2013 sometimes the ideas we want to say get a little tangled, especially when we\u2019re juggling new concepts like *prime numbers* and *prime factors*.  \n\n**What this tells me:**  \n- You\u2019re thinking about the question, which is the most important first step.  \n- You might need a little prompting to pull the pieces together and finish your thought.\n\nLet\u2019s try to **complete** what you were going to say. Remember, a **prime number** is a whole number greater than\u202f1 that has **exactly two** positive divisors:\u202f1 and itself. A **prime factor** is simply a factor of a number that is also prime.\n\n**Quick check:**  \n- Can you finish the sentence \u201cA prime number is \u2026\u201d in your own words?  \n- Then, can you give **one example** of a prime number and **one example** of a prime factor of a larger number (e.g., 12)?\n\nTake a moment, write it out, and we\u2019ll move on together.

Then, using those prime factors, find the **greatest common factor (GCF)** of 84 and **126**.\n\n**Why this is useful for you:**  \nYou\u2019ve already practiced \u201cFactors and Highest Common Factor,\u201d and today we\u2019ll tie that knowledge directly to prime factorization. Working through the prime\u2011factor list makes spotting the GCF much easier.\n\n#### Steps to Follow (you can write them down as you go)\n\n1. **Prime\u2011factorize 84**  \n   - Start by dividing by",

The next hurdle is **using** that definition to identify primes and break numbers down into their prime factors.  Think of it like a puzzle: once you know the rule (\u201conly two divisors:\u202f1 and itself\u201d), the pieces start to fall into place.\n\nLet\u2019s give it another try together.

A quick trick: keep dividing by the smallest possible prime (2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f\u2026) until you can\u2019t divide any further.\n\nYou\u2019ve already shown you can identify when a number is *not* prime (e.g., recognizing that 12 is divisible by 2).
