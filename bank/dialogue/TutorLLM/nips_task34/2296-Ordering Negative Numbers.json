It\u2019s completely okay to feel stuck \u2013\u202fordering negative numbers can be tricky at first, especially if place\u2011value ideas are still getting settled. Let\u2019s break it down together.\n\n1. **What does \u201csmaller\u201d mean for negative numbers?**  \n   On a number line, the farther left you go, the smaller (or \u201cless\u201d) the number is. Because negatives are to the left of zero, the **more negative** a number is, the **smaller** it is.\n\n2. **Visual cue:**  \n   ```\n   \u2026  -10   -9   -8   -7   -6   -5   -4   -3   -2   -1   0 \u2026\n   ```\n   See how -9 sits left of -6, which sits left of -4, and so on? That left\u2011to\u2011right order is exactly the \u201csmallest\u2011to\u2011largest\u201d order we need.\n\n3. **Applying it to the four numbers**  \n   - The **most negative** (furthest left) is **\u20119**.  \n   - Next comes **\u20116**.  \n   - Then **\u20114**.  \n   - Finally the **least negative** (closest to zero) is **\u20112**.\n\nSo the correct ordering from **smallest (least) to largest (greatest)** is:\n\n```\n-9, -6,",
