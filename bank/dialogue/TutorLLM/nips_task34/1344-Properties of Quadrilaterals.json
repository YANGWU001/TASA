Label any given lengths, angles, or coordinates. Visualising the figure can make the relationships much clearer. |\n| **Identify known properties** | Recall the defining traits of each quadrilateral type (e.g., opposite sides parallel in a parallelogram, all sides equal & all angles right in a square, one pair of parallel sides in a trapezoid). |\n| **Use slopes or vectors** | If the vertices are given in the coordinate plane, compute slopes (or direction vectors) of the sides. Parallel sides have equal slopes (or proportional vectors); perpendicular sides have slopes that are negative reciprocals. |\n| **Check side lengths** | When coordinates are given, use the distance formula to compare lengths. Equal opposite sides point toward a parallelogram; all four equal sides point toward a rhombus or square. |\n| **Combine clues** | Often a single piece of information isn\u2019t enough. Combine slope information with side\u2011length information to narrow down the exact type. |\n\nSince you\u2019ve previously struggled with **translation & vectors** and **gradient (slope) between two coordinates**, try leaning on those tools now. They\u2019re especially powerful for quadrilateral problems that involve points on a grid.\n\n---\n\n## \u25b6 Next Practice Question (Properties of Quadrilaterals)\n\n**Problem**\n\nThe vertices of a",

Parallel sides have the same slope; perpendicular sides have slopes that are negative reciprocals. |\n| **You need a property (area, perimeter, diagonals)** | Which formula matches the shape you think it is? If you\u2019re unsure, try the most general formula (e.g., \u201carea = \u00bd\u202f|d\u2081\u00b7d\u2082\u00b7sin\u202f\u03b8|\u201d for any quadrilateral) and see if the numbers simplify. |\n| **You\u2019re running out of time** | Sketch a quick diagram, label what you know, and eliminate answer choices that clearly violate a property (e.g., a \u201ctrapezoid\u201d can\u2019t have both pairs of opposite sides parallel). |\n\nTry to adopt one of these questions the next time you feel stuck\u2014you\u2019ll often find a piece of the puzzle falls into place!\n\n---\n\n## \u25b6 Next Practice Question (Properties of Quadrilaterals)\n\n**Problem**\n\nFour points are given in the coordinate plane:\n\n- \\(A(1,\\,",
