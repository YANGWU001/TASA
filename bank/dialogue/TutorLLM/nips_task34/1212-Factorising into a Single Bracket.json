A good trick is to list the prime factors of the coefficients first (e.g., 12\u202f=\u202f2\u00b72\u00b73, 30\u202f=\u202f2\u00b73\u00b75) and then pick the common ones.  \n- **Signs and negative coefficients** \u2013 you\u2019ve already shown confidence with adding/subtracting and multiplying/dividing negative numbers. When a term is negative, remember the GCF can also be taken as a negative number (e.g., factorising \\(-8x^{2}+12x\\) gives \\(-4x(2x-3)\\)). This keeps the bracket \u201cclean\u201d and avoids a leading negative sign inside the parentheses.  \n",
