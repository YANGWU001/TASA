Draw the base** | With the straightedge, draw a line segment **AB = 6\u202fcm**. | This gives you a fixed side to start from. |\n| **2. Set the given angle** | Place the compass point at **A**. Using the compass, draw an arc that crosses the line through **A** (the ray that will become AC). Then, with a protractor (or by constructing a 45\u00b0 angle with a compass), draw a second ray from **A** that makes a **45\u00b0** angle with **AB**. | The angle \u2220BAC is now correctly positioned. |\n| **3.
