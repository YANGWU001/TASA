Getting comfortable with substitution will make the whole chain smoother. |\n| **Adding/subtracting negatives** | When you list multiples (\u2026, \u201312, \u20136, 0, 6, 12, \u2026) you\u2019re actually working with negative numbers, too. Recognising that the LCM is always a *positive* number, even if you start from a negative multiple, helps avoid sign errors. |\n\nSo the \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d is pointing us to a quick refresher on **how to find the Least Common Multiple** and how to **use it in the next step**.
