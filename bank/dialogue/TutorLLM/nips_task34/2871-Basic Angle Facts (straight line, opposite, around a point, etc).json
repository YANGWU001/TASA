That\u2019s an important first step\u2014recognizing a gap lets us fill it.  \n\n**What we can work on:**  \n1. **Don\u2019t wait for certainty before you try.**  Even a guess (e.g., \u201cmaybe the angle is \u2026\u201d) gives us information to discuss.  \n2. **Use the facts you already know.**  \n   * *Straight\u2011line (linear pair) fact*: two adjacent angles that form a straight line add to\u202f180\u00b0.  \n   * *Vertical\u2011angle fact*: opposite (vertical) angles are equal.  \n   * *Around\u2011a\u2011point fact*: all angles that meet at a point add to\u202f360\u00b0.  \n3. **Visualise the situation.**  Sketching the rays and labeling the given angle helps the brain see the relationships.  \n\n**A quick \u201cthink\u2011aloud\u201d strategy you can try next time**  \n1. **Draw the",
