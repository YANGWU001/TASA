Let\u2019s work on line\u2011symmetry together.**  \n\nBelow is a picture you can picture in your mind (or draw quickly on a piece of paper).\u202fRead the description carefully and then answer the question.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcd0 Practice Question\n\n**Shape description**\n\n1. Start with a regular **isosceles triangle** whose base is horizontal.  \n2. The triangle\u2019s height goes straight up from the midpoint of the base.  \n3. Inside the triangle, draw a **vertical line** that starts at the top vertex and ends at the midpoint of the base (so it splits the triangle into two equal right\u2011triangles).  \n4. On the **left half** of the triangle, draw a small **square** whose bottom side lies on the base of the triangle and whose left side touches the left slant side of the triangle.  \n5. On the **right half** of the triangle, draw a small **circle** whose bottom point touches the base of the triangle and whose rightmost point touches the right slant side of the triangle.\n\n*(If you\u2019d like, sketch this quickly \u2013 it helps to see the picture.)*\n\n**Question**\n\n> **Which of the following statements about the line of symmetry of this whole figure is true?**  \n> A) The vertical line drawn in step\u202f3 is a line of symmetry.  \n> B) A diagonal line from the top vertex to the lower\u2011right corner of the square is a line of symmetry.  \n> C) A horizontal line through the midpoint of the base is a line of symmetry.  \n> D) The figure has **no** line of symmetry.\n\n---\n\n### How to answer\n\n1. **Look at the whole picture** (the triangle, the vertical line, the square on the left, and the circle on the right).  \n2. **Imagine folding the shape along each suggested line** \u2013 would every part line up perfectly with its counterpart",

You noticed the square and the circle on the left side and tried to see how the vertical line would affect each part.  \n- **You used the definition of a line of symmetry** (\u201cthe line cuts the figure into two mirror\u2011image halves\u201d) to evaluate the vertical line.  \n\n**Where you can improve**  \n- **Check every element individually** \u2013 a line is a symmetry line for the *entire* figure only if *all* parts match up after the \u201cfold\u201d.  \n  - The isosceles triangle is indeed mirrored by a vertical line through its apex.  \n  - The square on the left, however, will be reflected onto a *different* spot on the right side of the line. Unless there is an identical square in that reflected position, the square **breaks** the symmetry.  \n  - The circle, being a perfectly round shape, is symmetric about *any* line that passes through its centre. If the centre is not on the vertical line, the circle will also be moved to a new location after the fold.  \n\nBecause the square (and possibly the circle) do **not** line up with matching copies on the opposite side, the vertical line **is not** a line of symmetry for the whole picture.  \n\n**Bottom line:**  \n> Your reasoning was on the right track, but remember to verify that *every* component of the figure has a matching partner after the reflection. If even one part fails, the line is not a symmetry line for the whole figure.\n\n---\n\n### ",

That\u2019s exactly the kind of \u201cbig\u2011picture\u201d thinking that helps with symmetry problems.  \n- **You used the word \u201cline of symmetry.\u201d**  Recognizing that the vertical line could be a candidate shows you\u2019re linking the idea of a *reflection* (which you\u2019ve mastered) to line symmetry.\n\n**Where you can improve**  \n- **Check *both* sides of the line.** A line is a line of symmetry only if every part on one side matches a part on the other side after a mirror\u2011flip. In the picture, the square and the circle are **only on the left** of the vertical line, so they have nothing to match on the right. That means the vertical line does **not** satisfy the definition of symmetry for the whole figure.  \n- **Focus on the complete figure, not just one shape.** The isosceles triangle *is* symmetric about that vertical line, but the entire picture (triangle\u202f+\u202fsquare\u202f+\u202fcircle) is not. When a problem asks about \u201cthe figure\u201d you must consider all the components together.\n\n**What to remember next time**  \n> A line of symmetry exists when the figure can be folded along that",
