Since you\u2019ve already shown you can handle the basics, this one will let you apply the ideas you know and build confidence.\n\n---\n\n### Practice Question\n\n> In triangle **ABC**, the measure of \u2220A is **45\u00b0** and the measure of \u2220B is **70\u00b0**.  \n> What is the measure of \u2220C?\n\n**A.** 55\u00b0\u2003\u2003**B.** 65\u00b0\u2003\u2003**C.** 75\u00b0\u2003\u2003**D.** 85\u00b0  \n\n*(Remember: the three interior angles of any triangle always add up to 180\u00b0.)*\n\n---\n\n### Quick Hint (if you need it)\n\n1. Write the equation for the angle sum:  \n   \\[\n   \\angle A + \\angle B + \\angle C = 180^\\circ\n   \\]\n2. Plug in the known angles (45\u00b0 and 70\u00b0).  \n3. Solve for the missing angle.\n\nGive it a try, and let me know which answer you chose (or what you get after solving).
