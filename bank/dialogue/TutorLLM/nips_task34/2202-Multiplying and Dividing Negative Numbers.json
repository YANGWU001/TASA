Let\u2019s look at what you wrote:\n\n> \u201cI think the expression\u202f\\((-12)\\)\u202fjust equals **12**. I guess you drop the parentheses and the minus sign somehow, so the answer is a positive twelve.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 1. What\u2019s happening with the parentheses?\n\nThe parentheses in \\((-12)\\) are **not** there to \u201chide\u201d the minus sign; they are simply grouping the whole number \\(-12\\) as a single entity. Think of \\((-12)\\) as \u201cthe number twelve with a negative sign attached to it.\u201d Removing the parentheses does **not** change the sign:\n\n\\[\n(-12) \\;=\\; -12\n\\]\n\nIf you ever see something like \\(-(-12)\\), the *outside* minus sign **does** change the sign (it would become \\(+12\\)), but that\u2019s a different situation.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Why the sign matters when we multiply or divide\n\nWhen you multiply or divide, the **sign rules** are what determine whether the answer is positive or negative:\n\n| Operation | Sign Rule |\n|-----------|-----------|\n| Positive\u202f\u00d7\u202fPositive | **Positive** |\n| Negative\u202f\u00d7\u202fNegative | **Positive** |\n| Positive\u202f\u00d7\u202fNegative | **Negative** |\n| Negative\u202f\u00d7\u202fPositive | **Negative** |\n| (Same rules apply for division) | |\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- \\((-12) \\times 3 = -36\\) (negative \u00d7 positive \u2192 negative)  \n- \\((-12) \\times (-3) = 36\\) (negative \u00d7 negative \u2192 positive)  \n\nNotice how the *number* \\(-12\\) stays negative until it is paired with another sign.\n\n---\n\n### 3.
