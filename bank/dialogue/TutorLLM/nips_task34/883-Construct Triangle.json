This point will be **C**.  \n4. **Complete the triangle** \u2013 Connect points **B** and **C** with a straight line.\n\n---\n\n### Deliverable\n\nWrite a short, step\u2011by\u2011step description (in your own words) of how you would carry out each of the four steps above. Include any checks you would perform to be sure the construction is accurate (e.g., measuring lengths, confirming the angle).\n\n*Feel free to sketch the figure on paper as you work\u2014just describe the process in text for this exercise.*",
