I see you wrote \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u202fThat\u2019s totally okay \u2013 it\u2019s a sign you\u2019re being honest about where you\u2019re stuck, and that\u2019s the first step toward mastering the skill.  \n\nWhen a problem feels confusing, it helps to break it into *tiny* pieces you can tackle one at a time. With ordering negative numbers, the trick is to remember that **the farther left a number is on the number line, the smaller it is**. In other words, the more negative the value, the *smaller* (or \u201cless\u201d) it is.\n\nLet\u2019s try a quick mental picture:\n\n```\n\u2026  -5   -4   -3   -2   -1   0   1   2 \u2026\n```\n\nNotice how **\u20115** is left of **\u20114**, which is left of **\u20113**, and so on. So when we\u2019re asked to put numbers in order from *smallest to largest*, we start with the one that sits farthest to the left (the most negative) and move rightward.\n\n---\n\n### A Mini\u2011Strategy Checklist\n\n1. **Identify the sign** \u2013 Are the numbers negative or positive? (All of the numbers in this skill are negative, so we\u2019ll focus on that.)  \n2. **Look at the absolute value** \u2013 Ignore the minus sign for a moment and see how big the number would be if it were positive.  \n3. **Compare the absolute values** \u2013 The *larger* the absolute value, the *more negative* the original number, so it comes **first** in the list.  \n4. **Write them from most\u2011negative \u2192 least\u2011negative** (i.e., from biggest absolute value \u2192 smallest absolute value).\n\n---\n\n### Let\u2019s Warm Up Together\n\n**Question:** Arrange the following numbers from **smallest to largest**.\n\n```\n-7 , -",
