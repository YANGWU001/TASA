That\u2019s a low score, so let\u2019s treat this as an opportunity to build a solid foundation before we move on to more complex problems.\n\n**What\u2019s happening?**  \nWhen we factor an expression into a *single* bracket we are looking for the **greatest common factor (GCF)** that can be taken out of every term. Once we pull the GCF out, what remains inside the bracket is a single binomial (or monomial) that cannot be broken down further.\n\n**Why it matters for you**  \n\n* **Time\u2011word problems** \u2013 many of them simplify to expressions like\u202f`5t\u202f+\u202f10`. Spotting the GCF (here,\u202f5) lets you rewrite the expression as `5(t\u202f+\u202f2)`, which makes it easier to solve for the unknown time.  \n* **Parts of a circle** \u2013 area or perimeter formulas often contain a common factor (e.g., `\u03c0r\u00b2\u202f+\u202f2\u03c0r`). Factoring out `\u03c0r` gives `\u03c0r(r\u202f+\u202f2)`, a cleaner form for further manipulation.\n\nSo, mastering this skill will give you a shortcut in the topics you\u2019ve previously struggled with.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question (Personalised)\n\n### Problem\nA rectangular garden has a length that is **3\u202fm** longer than its width.
