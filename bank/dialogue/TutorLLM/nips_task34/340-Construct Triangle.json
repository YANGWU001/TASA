First off, I love that you\u2019re *trying* to picture the construction and that you\u2019re thinking about which side to draw first. That\u2019s exactly the right mindset \u2013 geometry is as much about visualising as it is about following steps.\n\nYou wrote:\n\n> \u201cUm\u2026 I think I got the idea, but I\u2019m not totally sure I\u2019m doing it right.

It\u2019s helpful to decide *exactly* what you\u2019ll do after you have AB drawn (e.g., set the compass, draw an arc, etc.). |\n| **Thinking about the length** \u2013 you mentioned \u201cthe shortest side first\u201d. That can be a good idea when the problem gives you the lengths of all three sides, because the shortest side is easiest to fit inside the other two arcs. | **Connecting it to the angle facts** \u2013 earlier you struggled a bit with straight\u2011line and opposite\u2011angle ideas. When you draw arcs, you\u2019re actually using those angle concepts (the arcs represent all possible locations that satisfy a given distance). |\n\n### A Quick \u201cWhat\u2011next\u201d Checklist\n\n1. **Draw the chosen side (AB)** with the exact length given (e.g., 5\u202fcm).  \n2. **Set your compass** to the length of the second side (say, AC = 7\u202fcm).
