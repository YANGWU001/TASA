Which require them to be the same length?\n  2. **What extra info does the problem give?** \u2013 Does it mention right angles, all sides equal, or just one pair of parallel sides?\n\nKeeping these two questions in mind will help you sift through the answer choices faster.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question \u2013 \u201cBuild the Quadrilateral\u201d\n\n> **Situation**  \n> A quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\) has the following properties:  \n> 1. **One pair of opposite sides is parallel and congruent.**  \n> 2. **The other pair of opposite",
