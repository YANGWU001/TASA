Visualize (or draw) the triangle based on the description.  \n2. Think about how you could \u201cfold\u201d the triangle so that the two halves match perfectly.  \n3.

They don\u2019t match when you flip them, so the shape is **not** symmetrical about that line.  \n- The only way the two halves match perfectly is the vertical line described above.\n\n**Your answer (choice C) was close, but the correct choice is **B** \u2013 \u201cOne line of symmetry (vertical).\u201d**  \n\nDon\u2019t be discouraged! Mis\u2011identifying extra lines of symmetry is a very common stumbling block. You already showed you can visualize the shape; now we just need to sharpen the rule: *count only those lines that map the whole shape onto itself when folded.*  \n\n**A quick tip to remember:**  \n> **If you can draw the line and then \u201cfold\u201d the shape so the two sides line up perfectly, that line is a symmetry line.**  \n> For triangles, only *equilateral* triangles have three symmetry lines; *isosceles* triangles have exactly one; *scalene* triangles have none.\n\n---\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next",

When you try to \u201cfold\u201d along that line, the two halves do **not** match, so it is **not** a line of symmetry.  \n\n**Why it\u2019s easy to get mixed up**  \nSometimes we think, \u201cIf I draw a line through the centre, maybe it\u2019s a symmetry line,\u201d but symmetry is stricter: every point on one side of the line must have a matching point the same distance on the other side. The horizontal line fails that test for an isosceles triangle.\n\n**What to keep doing**  \n- Keep **drawing the shape** and then **folding it mentally (or with paper)**. If the two halves line up perfectly, you\u2019ve found a symmetry line.  \n- When you\u2019re unsure, **label the vertices** (e.g., A\u2011B\u2011C) and ask: *If I reflect point A over this line, where does it land?* If the reflected point lands on a different part of the figure, the line is not a symmetry line.\n\n**A quick confidence boost** \u2013",
