Calculate the **area** of the garden in square meters.  \n3. If you wanted to **fence** the garden, what would be the total length of fence needed (the perimeter)?\n\n---\n\n**How to approach it**\n\n1. Remember that a *square* of a number\u202f\\(n\\) is \\(n^2\\) and a *cube* of a number\u202f\\(m\\) is \\(m^3\\).  \n2. Find the integer \\(n\\) such that \\(n^2 = 144\\).  \n3. Find the integer \\(m\\) such that \\(m^3 = 125\\).  \n4. Use the formulas:  \n   - Area\u202f=\u202flength\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth  \n   - Perimeter\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(length\u202f+\u202fwidth)\n\nWrite down each step you take\u2014this will help you see where any mistakes might happen.\n\nGive it a try, and let me know your answers (including the numbers you discovered in step\u202f1).
