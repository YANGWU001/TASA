Let\u2019s fill in those gaps together:\n\n1. **Multiply \u20139 \u00d7 3**  \n   - Remember the rule: *negative \u00d7 positive = negative*.  \n   - So \\(-9 \\times 3 = -27\\).\n\n2. **Divide the result by \u20133**  \n   - The rule for division is the same as for multiplication: *negative \u00f7 negative = positive*.  \n   - \\(-27 \u00f7 (\u20113) = 9\\).\n\n**Final answer:**\u202f\\(9\\)\n\nYou were on the right track; you just needed to finish the arithmetic and apply the sign rules.
