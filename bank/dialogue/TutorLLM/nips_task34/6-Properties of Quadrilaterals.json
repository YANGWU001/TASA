If you know the triangle\u2011angle sum (180\u00b0), you can often find missing angles in the quadrilateral. |\n\nGive yourself a moment to run through that checklist before you answer the next question.

(2)\u202fWhat is the *one* piece you\u2019re missing? Focus on the missing piece. |\n\nYou\u2019ve already shown great perseverance in earlier topics (time, angles in triangles, place value).

For quadrilaterals, drawing the shape often reveals its properties (parallel sides, right angles, etc.). |\n| **You\u2019re stuck on the wording** | Highlight the key words (e.g., \u201cparallel,\u201d \u201ccongruent,\u201d \u201cright angle\u201d). Ask yourself: *Which property does that word usually belong to?* |\n| **You\u2019re worried about time** | Give yourself a **30\u2011second** \u201cthinking timer.\u201d Write down any fact you remember, even if it seems small. That\u2019s often enough to spark the next step. |\n| **You\u2019re not sure which formula to use** | Recall the \u201cbig picture\u201d list of quadrilateral families (parallelogram, rectangle, rhombus, square, trapezoid, kite). Ask: *Does the shape in the problem belong to one of these families?* If yes, the family\u2019s defining properties are the answer. |\n\nYou\u2019ve already shown strong perseverance in other areas (you kept trying even after missing a time\u2011problem and an angles\u2011in\u2011triangles question). Let\u2019s carry that same energy into quadrilaterals!\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question \u2013 Properties of Quadrilaterals\n\n**Question:**  \nA quadrilateral has **both pairs of opposite sides parallel** and **one interior angle that measures 90\u00b0",

If you split a quadrilateral into two triangles (by drawing a diagonal), you\u2019ll see why the total becomes 360\u00b0.  \n3. **Identify the \u201ckey properties\u201d** \u2013 Different quadrilaterals have special side\u2011parallel or side\u2011equal rules (e.g., a rectangle has opposite sides parallel *and* all angles 90\u00b0, a rhombus has all sides equal, etc.).  \n\nThink of it like a puzzle: once you know a few pieces (like the angle sum or which sides are parallel), the rest falls into place. We\u2019ll practice that step\u2011by\u2011step, and you\u2019ll see the patterns emerge.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question \u2013 *Properties of Quadrilaterals*\n\n> **Question:**  \n> A quadrilateral has **four right angles** and **opposite sides that are equal in length**.  \n> \n>",
