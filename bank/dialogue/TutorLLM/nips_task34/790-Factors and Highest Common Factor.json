I\u2019m really glad you took a moment to think about where the idea of a *factor* got fuzzy for you.\u202fHere\u2019s what I noticed and a few suggestions to tighten the concept up:\n\n| What you said | Why it matters | How to make it stick |\n|---------------|----------------|----------------------|\n| *\u201cA factor is any whole number that divides\u2026\u201d* | You\u2019ve captured the core definition correctly \u2013 a factor **evenly divides** the target number (no remainder). | Write the definition in **your own words** and add a tiny example right next to it, e.g., \u201cA factor of 12 is a whole number that can be multiplied by another whole number to give 12 (1\u202f\u00d7\u202f12, 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f6, 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4).\u201d |\n| You mentioned you got **stuck** when you tried to list the factors. | Listing can feel tedious, especially when the numbers get bigger, but it\u2019s a powerful way to see the common factors and the HCF. | Use **prime factorisation** as a shortcut (e.g., 36\u202f=\u202f2\u00b2\u00b73\u00b2, 48\u202f=\u202f2\u2074\u00b73\u00b9).
