For ordering numbers (especially negatives) you can:\n\n1. **Draw a quick number line** \u2013 put a short line on a piece of paper and mark a few reference points: \u2026\u202f\u201110\u202f\u2014\u202f\u20115\u202f\u2014\u202f\u20112\u202f\u2014\u202f\u20111\u202f\u2014\u202f0\u202f\u2014\u202f1\u202f\u2014\u202f2\u202f\u2014\u202f5\u202f\u2014\u202f10.  \n2. **Place each number where it belongs** \u2013 start with the numbers you\u2019re most comfortable with (e.g., 0 and the positive numbers) and then work outward to the negatives.  \n3. **Read from left (most negative) to right (most positive).**  \n\nYou\u2019ll see that the \u201cmost negative\u201d number is the one farthest left on the line.\n\nLet\u2019s try it together for the numbers \\(-4,\\;3,\\;-9,\\;0,\\;-2\\):\n\n- The biggest (right\u2011most) numbers are the positive ones: **3** and **0** (0 is less than 3).  \n- Among the negatives, the one with the largest absolute value is the smallest: **\u20119** (far left).  \n- Then comes **\u20114**, then **\u20112** as we move rightward.\n\nSo the correct order is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-9,\\; -4,\\; -2,\\; 0,\\; 3",

Think of it like a puzzle: before you can place the big pieces, you need to sort the tiny ones first.  \n\nHere are a few ideas that often help students who are working on **ordering negative numbers**:\n\n| What often trips people up | A quick way to check it |\n|----------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Mixing up the direction of the number line** (thinking \u201c\u20113 is bigger than \u20111\u201d because 3 is bigger than 1) | Remember: **the farther left you go, the smaller the number**. On a number line, \u20115 is left of \u20112, so \u20115\u202f<\u202f\u20112. |\n| **Ignoring the sign** and comparing the absolute values only | Write the numbers with their signs side\u2011by\u2011side, then **ask yourself**: \u201cIf I walk left from 0, which step lands farther away?\u201d |\n| **Seeing a minus sign and thinking \u201cnegative means less important\u201d** | Treat the minus sign as *direction*, not as \u201cless\u201d. It tells you to go left on the line. |\n\nA simple mental trick: **\u201cThe bigger the absolute value, the smaller the number when it\u2019s negative.\u201d** So \u20118 is smaller than \u20113 because 8\u202f>\u202f3.\n\n---\n\n### Let\u2019s Try a New Problem\n\nBelow is a practice question that builds on the ideas above.
