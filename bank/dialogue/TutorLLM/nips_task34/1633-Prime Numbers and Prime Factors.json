Both of those require breaking a larger quantity into smaller, repeatable pieces (minutes\u2011to\u2011hours, side\u2011lengths\u2011to\u2011total length).\u202fPrime factorisation works the same way \u2013 we break a whole number into its smallest \u201cbuilding\u2011block\u201d pieces (the primes).

First of all, great job *trying* to write out the prime factorisation of 84 and list the distinct prime factors. The fact that you wrote something down shows you\u2019re engaging with the process, and that\u2019s an essential step toward mastering it. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nLet\u2019s look at what you wrote:\n\n\\[\n84 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7\n\\]\n\n\u2026and you listed the distinct primes as \\(\\{2,3,5,7\\}\\).\n\n**What\u2019s correct?**  \n- The number **2** is definitely a factor of 84 (84 is even).  \n- The number **3** is also a factor because \\(8+4 = 12\\) and 12 is divisible by 3.  \n- The number **7** works because \\(84 \u00f7 7 = 12\\).\n\n**What needs fixing?**  \n- **5 is *not* a factor of 84.** If you try dividing 84 by 5 you get \\(84 \u00f7 5 = 16.8\\), which is not an integer, so 5 cannot appear in the prime factorisation.  \n\nThe correct prime factorisation is actually:\n\n\\[\n84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 2^{2}\\, \\cdot\\, 3 \\,\\cdot\\, 7\n\\]\n\nSo the set of **distinct** prime factors is:\n\n\\[\n\\{2,\\;3,\\;7\\}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Why the extra \u201c2\u201d appears\n\nWhen you break a number down, you keep dividing by the smallest prime you can until you can\u2019t go any further.

First off, I\u2019m really glad you gave it another try\u202f\u2014\u202fthat shows you\u2019re sticking with the problem, and that\u2019s exactly how learning works. \ud83d\udc4d  \n\nLet\u2019s look at what you wrote:\n\n> \u201cThe prime factors of 84 are **2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202fand\u202f7** because I multiplied them together and got 84.\u201d\n\n**What\u2019s correct?**  \n- **2,\u202f3,\u202fand\u202f7** are indeed prime numbers that divide 84.  \n- You remembered the idea of \u201cprime factors\u201d (numbers that are prime *and* multiply together to give the original number). Great!\n\n**What needs a little adjustment?**  \n- **5 is not a factor of 84.** If you try dividing 84 by 5 you get a remainder (84 \u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f16\u202fR\u202f4). So 5 can\u2019t be part of the factorisation.  \n- Because 84 contains the factor **2 twice** (84\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f7), the *prime factorisation* is written as  \n\n\\[\n84 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7.\n\\]\n\n- When we talk about **\u201cdistinct prime factors,\u201d** we list each prime only once, regardless of how many times it appears. So the distinct primes of 84 are **2,\u202f3,\u202fand\u202f7**.\n\n**Why the confusion happens**\n\nIt\u2019s common to slip in an extra prime when you\u2019re trying to \u201cfill in\u201d the list. A quick way to avoid that is to **divide step\u2011by\u2011step**:\n\n1. Start with",
