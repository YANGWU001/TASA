It shows you\u2019re being honest with yourself, which is the first step toward mastering a new idea.\n\n**What\u2019s happening?**  \nThe question about the cafeteria, gym, and library is asking you to find a **common \u201creset\u201d day** \u2013 the day when all three schedules line\u2011up again. To do that we need two ideas:\n\n1. **Multiples** \u2013 numbers you get when you keep adding the same number (e.g., multiples of 12 are 12,\u202f24,\u202f36 \u2026).  \n2. **Lowest Common Multiple (LCM)** \u2013 the smallest number that appears in the multiple lists of *all* the given numbers.\n\nBecause you\u2019ve been working on multiples and LCM, let\u2019s break the process into bite\u2011size steps and connect it to the other things you\u2019ve practiced (place\u2011value and BIDMAS).

In that case, you got the right answer!  \n- If the numbers were different, the LCM might be another value, so it\u2019s always good to show **how** you found the answer. That way the tutor (and you!) can see the reasoning and catch any small slip\u2011ups.\n\n**What to do next time**\n\n1. **List the multiples** of each number (or use prime\u2011factorization) so you can see where they first meet.  \n2. **Write the LCM** in a sentence: \u201cThe smallest number that is a multiple of 4, 6, and 10 is 60, so the schedules line\u2011up after 60\u202fhours.\u201d  \n3. **Check your work** by dividing the LCM by each original number; the result should be a whole number.\n\nYou\u2019re on the right track\u2014just add a little more detail to make your solution crystal\u2011clear.

The LCM tells you after how many hours the three schedules line\u2011up again.\n\nYou were on the right track thinking about \u201c60\u201d. If the three periods really were 4,\u202f6 and\u202f10, the LCM *is* 60, so the answer would be correct. If any of the numbers were different, the LCM would change.  \n\nNext time, try writing the prime\u2011factorisation of each period first \u2013 that makes spotting the LCM much easier.
