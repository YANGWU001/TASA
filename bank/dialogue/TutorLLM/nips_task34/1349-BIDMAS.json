Recognising a gap is the first step toward closing it, and you\u2019ve already taken that step by letting me know where you\u2019re stuck.  \n\n**Why it matters:**  \nWhen we work with BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction) we have to follow a specific order, otherwise the answer can be very different.

Not knowing something is the perfect starting point for learning it.

The good news is that each of these skills can be built step\u2011by\u2011step, and we\u2019ll practice them in small, manageable chunks.\n\n**How we\u2019ll move forward**\n\n1. **Break the problem into pieces** \u2013 first look for any brackets, then any powers, then handle division/multiplication before addition/subtraction.  \n2. **Name what you see** \u2013 \u201cthe bracket part\u201d, \u201cthe multiplication part\u201d, etc. This helps you keep track of the order.  \n3. **Estimate** \u2013 before you crunch the numbers, round each factor to a convenient number and see roughly what the answer should be. If your final result is far off, you\u2019ll know something went wrong.  \n4. **Write the expression** \u2013 start by underlining the key actions in the word problem (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and then translate them one by one.\n\nLet\u2019s put those ideas into practice right now.  \n\n---\n\n## Practice Question (BIDMAS + Naming + Estimating)\n\n> **Word problem**  \n> A garden has **3 rows** of flower beds.",
