That\u2019s an important skill\u2014recognizing patterns is the first step in any sequence problem.\n\n**Where the reasoning went off track**\n\n- A **geometric** sequence multiplies (or divides) by a constant factor each step (e.g., 2,\u202f4,\u202f8,\u202f16 \u2026\u202f\u00d72 each time).  \n- An **arithmetic** (linear) sequence adds (or subtracts) a constant amount each step (e.g., 3,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f15 \u2026\u202f+4 each time).\n\nThe topic we\u2019re practicing right now is **linear (arithmetic) sequences** and finding their *nth\u2011term formula*. If the numbers in the list change by the **same difference**, it\u2019s arithmetic; if they change by the **same ratio**, it\u2019s geometric.\n\nBecause the problem you were working on asked for the *nth term of a linear sequence*, the correct approach is to look for a constant **difference** between consecutive terms, not a constant ratio. Once you spot that difference, you can plug it into the standard form:\n\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\n\\]\n\nwhere  \n- \\(a_1\\) = first term,  \n- \\(d\\) = common difference.\n\n**What to try next**\n\n1. Write down the first few terms of the sequence.  \n2. Compute the differences between each pair of consecutive terms.  \n3. If those differences are the same, you\u2019ve identified an arithmetic sequence.  \n4. Use the first term and that common difference in the formula above to write the nth\u2011term expression.\n\nYou\u2019re on the right track by questioning the pattern\u2014keep that curiosity, and you\u2019ll quickly spot whether a sequence is arithmetic or geometric.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Find the",
