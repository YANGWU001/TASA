Ray **BA** points straight to the right (along the positive\u202fx\u2011axis), and ray **BC** is drawn upward to the left, forming an acute angle with ray **BA**.  \n> A protractor is placed with its center at point **B**, and the 0\u00b0/180\u00b0 line aligned with ray **BA**. The number **30\u00b0** is marked on the protractor where ray **BC** crosses it.\n\n```\n          C\n          *\n         /|\n        / |\n       /  |\n      /   |\n     /    |\n    *-----* A\n    B\n```\n\n> **Task:**  \n> Using the information given (the protractor alignment and the mark at 30\u00b0), determine the measure of \u2220ABC in degrees.\n\n---\n\n### How to approach it\n1. **Identify the reference line** on the protractor (the line that\u2019s aligned with ray\u202fBA).  \n2. **Locate the point where ray\u202fBC meets the protractor** \u2013 it\u2019s the 30\u00b0 mark.  \n3. **Read the angle** that is formed between ray\u202fBA (the reference line) and ray\u202fBC.\n\nWrite your answer below (just the number of degrees).

Therefore the measure of \u2220ABC is **30\u00b0**, not 45\u00b0.  \n\n**What went wrong?**  \nWhen you look at a diagram it\u2019s easy to \u201cguess\u201d the size of an angle, especially if you\u2019re used to working with right\u2011angle (90\u00b0) and 45\u2011degree \u201cspecial\u201d angles. The key is to **relate the angle to a reference line** that you already know \u2013 in this case the x\u2011axis \u2013 and then count the degrees based on the markings or the slope given in the problem.\n\n**How to improve**\n\n| Step | What to do | Why it helps |\n|------|------------|--------------|\n| 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Identify the baseline | Notice that ray\u202fBA is exactly the positive\u202fx\u2011axis (0\u00b0). | Gives you a fixed starting point. |\n| 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Look for clues",

The tilt is labelled **30\u00b0** above the x\u2011axis.\n\n3. **Measure the angle at the vertex B.**  \n   The angle \u2220ABC is the amount you rotate **from BA to BC**. Since BA is the 0\u00b0 line and BC is already drawn **30\u00b0** above it, the angle you need is exactly **30\u00b0** \u2013 not 45\u00b0.\n\n**Why 30\u00b0 and not something else?**  \nWhen a ray is described as \u201c30\u00b0 above the positive\u202fx\u2011axis,\u201d the angle it makes with the x\u2011axis *is* 30\u00b0.
