I hear you \u2013 the idea of line symmetry can feel a bit fuzzy at first, especially when you\u2019re trying to picture the \u201cfold\u2011and\u2011match\u201d line in your head.\u202fThat\u2019s totally normal, and the fact that you\u2019re asking for more clarity shows you\u2019re ready to deepen your understanding. \ud83d\udc4d  \n\nLet\u2019s break it down into bite\u2011size pieces:\n\n1. **What a line of symmetry *does*** \u2013 Imagine you have a shape drawn on a piece of paper and you draw a straight line on that paper. If you could cut the paper along that line and then fold the two halves together, every point on one side would land exactly on a matching point on the other side. That line is the *axis of symmetry*.\n\n2. **What the line *looks* like** \u2013 The line always runs through the \u201cmiddle\u201d of the shape, but \u201cmiddle\u201d doesn\u2019t always mean the geometric center (the centroid). It means the place where the shape can be split into two mirror\u2011image halves. For a square, you have four such lines (two through opposite sides, two through opposite corners). For an isosceles triangle, the line runs from the apex straight down to the midpoint of the base.\n\n3. **Why some shapes have *no* line of symmetry** \u2013 If you try to fold a shape that is irregular (like a scalene triangle or a random blob), the halves will never line up perfectly, so there is no symmetry line.\n\n**What to focus on next**\n\n- **Visualize**: Grab a piece of paper, draw a shape, and actually fold it! Seeing the halves line up (or not) makes the concept click.\n- **Identify \u201cmirror pairs\u201d**: Look for points or edges that could",
