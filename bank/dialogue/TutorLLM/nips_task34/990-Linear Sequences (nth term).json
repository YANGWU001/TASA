When two ideas are combined, it can feel like you\u2019re trying to solve two puzzles at once.  \n- **What to keep in mind:** A linear (arithmetic) sequence is simply a list of numbers that increase (or decrease) by the same amount each step. In a time\u2011based story, that \u201csame amount\u201d is the number of minutes between each bell. Once you see the pattern, the \u201cnth\u2011term\u201d formula \\(\\displaystyle a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\\) does all the work for you.  \n\n**Next step for you:**  \n1. Identify the *first* time the bell rings (that\u2019s \\(a_1\\)).  \n2. Identify the *constant interval* in minutes between rings (that\u2019s the common difference \\(d\\)).  \n3.
