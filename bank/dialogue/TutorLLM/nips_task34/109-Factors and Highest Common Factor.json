For example, because \\(2 \\times 9 = 18\\), both\u202f2\u202fand\u202f9\u202fare factors of\u202f18.\n\n2. **How to list them**  \n   - Start with the smallest factor,\u202f1, because\u202f1\u202fmultiplies with every number.  \n   - Then test the next integers (2,\u202f3,\u202f4, \u2026) until you reach the square root of the number.  \n   - Whenever you find a pair that multiplies to the target, write both numbers down.  \n\n3. **Finding the HCF**  \n   - Once you have the two factor lists, look for the **largest number that appears in **both** lists**. That\u2019s the Highest Common Factor (also called GCF).\n\n4. **Why it matters**  \n   Knowing the HCF helps you simplify fractions, work out how often two repeating events line up, and solve many \u201creal\u2011world\u201d problems (like scheduling two activities that happen at regular intervals).\n\nLet\u2019s try a short \u201cguided practice\u201d together before you attempt the next question on your own:\n\n| Number | Factor pairs (a\u202f\u00d7\u202fb) | All factors |\n|--------|----------------------|--------------|\n| 18     | 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f18, 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f9, 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f6   | 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f18 |\n",
