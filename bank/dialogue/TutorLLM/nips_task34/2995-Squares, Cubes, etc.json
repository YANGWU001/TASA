A quick check: 5\u202f+\u202f5\u202f+\u202f5\u202f+\u202f5\u202f+\u202f5 = 25, so 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 must be 25. |\n| b) Cube of **2** | 6 | A *cube* means **multiply the number by itself three times**:\u202f\\(2 \\times 2 \\times 2\\). | **8** | You did 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 = 4 and then added 2 (getting 6). The extra step is another multiplication by 2, not an addition: 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 = **8**. |\n\n#### Why the confusion is common  \n- **Square** = \u201carea of a side\u2011by\u2011side shape\u201d \u2192 one extra copy of the number.  \n- **Cube** = \u201cvolume of a side\u2011by\u2011side\u2011by\u2011side shape\u201d \u2192 two extra copies of the number.  \n\nThink of it as **repeated multiplication**, not repeated addition.\n\n#### Quick \u201ccheck\u2011your\u2011work\u201d tricks  \n\n1. **Square**:  \n   - Write the number twice: \\(5\\;5\\).  \n   - Put a multiplication sign between them: \\(5 \\times 5",
