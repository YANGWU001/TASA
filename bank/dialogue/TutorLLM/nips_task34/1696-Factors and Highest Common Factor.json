Write each number as a product of its prime factors.  \n2. Identify the primes that appear in **both** factorizations.  \n3. Multiply those common primes (using the smallest power for each) \u2013 that product is the HCF.  \n4. Once you have the HCF, you can list the common factors by taking every divisor of the HCF.\n\nGive it a try and let me know what you get!

That\u2019s normal; these ideas involve looking at the *building blocks* of numbers and comparing them. Below is a short, friendly walk\u2011through of how we solve an HCF problem. Follow the steps and you\u2019ll see that the process becomes a handy \u201crecipe\u201d you can use again and again.\n\n---\n\n## Mini\u2011Lesson: Finding the HCF of Two Numbers  \n\n### 1. What is a *factor*?\nA factor of a number is any whole number that divides it **without leaving a remainder**.  \nExample: The factors of 12 are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f12 because each of those numbers goes into 12 exactly.\n\n### 2. What is the *Highest* (or Greatest) Common Factor?\n- **Common factor** = a number that is a factor of *both* numbers.\n- **Highest** = the biggest one among those common factors.\n\n### 3. Two common ways to find the HCF  \n\n| Method | When it\u2019s handy |\n|--------|-----------------|\n| **Prime\u2011factor listing** | Small\u2011to\u2011moderate numbers; helps you see the overlap of prime factors. |\n| **Euclidean algorithm** | Larger numbers; uses repeated division and is very quick. |\n\nWe'll use the prime\u2011factor method for 84 and 126 because the numbers are manageable and it reinforces the idea of \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d.\n\n### 4. Step\u2011by\u2011step for **84** and **126**\n\n| Number | Prime\u2011factor breakdown | Factors (quick list) |\n|--------|------------------------|----------------------|\n| **84** | 84 \u00f7\u202f2 = ",
