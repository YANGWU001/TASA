This question is designed to review the key properties of the most common quadrilaterals while giving you a clear, step\u2011by\u2011step way to think it through.\n\n---\n\n## Practice Question\n\n**A quadrilateral has the following characteristics:**\n\n1. Both pairs of opposite sides are parallel.  \n2. One pair of opposite sides is equal in length, and the other pair is also equal in length.  \n3. One of its interior angles measures \\(90^\\circ\\).\n\n**Which type of quadrilateral is it?**  \n\nA) **Parallelogram**  \nB) **Rectangle**  \nC) **Rhombus**  \nD) **Trapezoid**  \n\n*Show your reasoning by listing the properties that match each answer choice and then selecting the best one.*\n\n---\n\n### How to Approach It\n\n1. **Recall the defining properties** of each quadrilateral listed above.  \n2. **Match each property** (parallel sides, equal sides, right angle) to the shapes.  \n3. **Eliminate choices** that don\u2019t satisfy all three conditions.  \n4. **State your final answer** and explain why the other options don\u2019t work.\n\n---\n\n#### Example of a Reasoning Sketch (you can fill in the details)\n\n| Shape | Both pairs of opposite sides parallel? | Both pairs of opposite sides equal? | Any right angles? |\n|------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Parallelogram | Yes | Yes (each pair) | Not required |\n| Rectangle | Yes | No (only opposite sides) | Yes (all four) |\n| Rhombus | Yes | Yes (all four sides equal) | Not required |\n| Tr",

Also, the question asked for *properties* (e.g., which sides are parallel, what the angles are), not just the name of the shape.  \n\nLet\u2019s finish the thought together. Think about the diagram (or description) that was given:  \n\n- Does the shape have **both pairs** of opposite sides parallel?  \n- Are the angles **right angles** (90\u00b0)?  \n- Are **all sides equal**?  \n\nAnswering these will help you identify the exact quadrilateral and list its key properties.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question \u2013 \u201cMatch the Quadrilateral\u201d\n\nBelow is a description of a quadrilateral.
