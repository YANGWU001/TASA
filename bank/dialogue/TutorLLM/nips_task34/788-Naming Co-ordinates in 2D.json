First of all, great job *recognizing* that something feels off \u2013 that\u2019s the most important step when learning a new concept. Let\u2019s unpack what you wrote and clear up a couple of common mix\u2011ups.\n\n| What you said | What\u2019s actually true | Why it matters |\n|---------------|---------------------|----------------|\n| \u201cThe point is written as **(y,\u202fx)** instead of **(x,\u202fy)**. The first number is the up\u2011down part, the second is the left\u2011right part.\u201d | In the standard Cartesian coordinate system we write a point as **(x,\u202fy)**. The **x\u2011coordinate** tells us how far we move **horizontally** (left\u2011right), and the **y\u2011coordinate** tells us how far we move **vertically** (up\u2011down). | This convention is used in virtually every math textbook, graphing calculator, and geometry problem. If we swapped the order, we would be labeling completely different locations. |\n| \u201cThe hour hand on a clock points to the y\u2011direction and the minute hand points to the x\u2011direction, so \u2018hours\u2019 are vertical moves and \u2018minutes\u2019 are horizontal moves.\u201d | A clock is a **polar** representation (angles measured around a circle), not a Cartesian (x\u2011y) grid. The hour hand and minute hand both rotate around the same center; neither one is permanently \u201cvertical\u201d or \u201chorizontal.\u201d When we translate a clock reading into coordinates we first convert the angle to an **x\u2011y pair** using\u202f\\(x = r\\cos\\theta\\) and\u202f\\(y = r\\sin\\theta\\). | Mixing the clock\u2019s rotational language with the Cartesian grid can create confusion, especially when we later need to talk about \u201cright\u2011left\u201d vs. \u201cup\u2011down.\u201d Keeping the two systems separate helps you avoid that mix\u2011up. |\n\n### What you did well\n1. **You noticed a pattern** (first number = up\u2011down, second = left",
