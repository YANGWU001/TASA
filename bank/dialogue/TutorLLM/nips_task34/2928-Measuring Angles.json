Using what you know about how the hands move on a clock, **calculate the measure of the smaller angle formed between the hour hand and the minute hand**.  \n> \n> (Give your answer in degrees, rounded to the nearest whole number.)\n\n---\n\n### How to approach it\n\n1. **Recall the basic facts**  \n   - The minute hand moves **360\u00b0** in **60 minutes** \u2192 **6\u00b0 per minute**.  \n   - The hour hand moves **360\u00b0** in **12 hours** \u2192 **30\u00b0 per hour** \u2192 **0.5\u00b0 per minute**.\n\n2. **Find the positions of the hands at 3:00**  \n   - **Minute hand**: At 12 \u2192 **0\u00b0** (starting point).  \n   - **Hour hand**: At the 3 \u2192 **3 \u00d7 30\u00b0 = 90\u00b0** from the 12\u2011o\u2019clock position.\n\n3. **Determine the angle between them**  \n   - Subtract the smaller angle from the larger: **|90\u00b0\u202f\u2212\u202f0\u00b0| = 90\u00b0**.  \n\n4. **Check if you need the \u201csmaller\u201d angle**  \n   - On a clock the two hands always form a pair of angles that add up to 360\u00b0.  \n   - The smaller of the two is **90\u00b0** (the larger would be 360\u00b0\u202f",

The minute hand is at 0\u00b0, the hour hand is at 90\u00b0, so the angle **between** them is 90\u00b0.  \n\nBecause we are asked for the *smaller* angle, we keep the 90\u00b0 (the other way around the clock would be 360\u00b0\u202f\u2212\u202f90\u00b0\u202f=\u202f270\u00b0, which is the larger angle).  \n\n**Common slip:**  \nWhen a problem involves a clock, remember that the hour hand also moves **as the minutes pass**. At exactly 3:00 the hour hand is exactly on the 3, but at 3:15 it would be a little past the 3. Keeping the \u201c30\u00b0 per hour\u201d rule in mind helps avoid the \u201cthey line up\u201d misconception.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next Practice Question \u2013 Measuring Angles on a Clock  \n\n> **Problem:**  \n> A clock shows the time **2:20**.
