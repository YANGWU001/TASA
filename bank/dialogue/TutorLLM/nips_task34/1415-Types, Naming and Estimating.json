Explain how you got your estimate.\n\n---\n\n### How to approach it\n\n- **Step\u202f1:** Look at the numbers \u201c7.3\u201d and \u201c4.2\u201d. Think about how they are written\u2014do they have a decimal point?  \n- **Step\u202f2:** Remember the basic shape names you\u2019ve learned (triangle, square, rectangle, circle, etc.). Which one has opposite sides that are equal and all angles are right angles?  \n- **Step\u202f3:** For the estimate, round each measurement to a number that\u2019s easy to multiply, then multiply those",
