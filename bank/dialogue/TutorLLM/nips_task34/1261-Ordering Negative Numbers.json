Seeing them left\u2011to\u2011right makes the order obvious. | A visual picture turns an abstract list into something concrete. |\n| **Compare each number to 0**. Anything negative is left of 0; the more negative the number, the farther left it goes. | It ties the concept to something you already know (positive numbers are \u201cto the right\u201d of zero). |\n| **Use \u201cbigger vs. smaller\u201d language**: \u201c-3 is bigger than -12 because -3 is closer to zero.\u201d | Reinforces the idea that \u201cbigger\u201d doesn\u2019t always mean \u201cmore positive.\u201d |\n| **Connect to a real\u2011world idea** (e.g., temperature): \u201c-12\u00b0C is colder than -3\u00b0C.\u201d | Real\u2011world anchors make the abstract ordering feel familiar. |\n\nYou\u2019ve already shown you can think about numbers in other contexts (time and place\u2011value problems).
