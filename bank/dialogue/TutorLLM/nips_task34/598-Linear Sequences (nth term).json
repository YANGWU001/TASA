That means you\u2019re comfortable with adding, subtracting, and spotting patterns\u2014skills that are exactly what we need for arithmetic (linear) sequences.\n\n* **Where the gap is:** The key idea in an arithmetic sequence is the **common difference** \u2013 the amount you add (or subtract) each step. Once you identify that, the nth\u2011term formula \\(a_n = an + b\\) falls right out of it.\n\n* **Next step for you:**  \n  1. Look at the first two terms and ask, \u201cHow far apart are they?\u201d  \n  2. Verify that the same jump occurs between every consecutive pair.  \n  3. Translate that constant jump into the coefficient **a** (the slope) in the formula.  \n  4. Use the first term to solve for **b** (the intercept).\n\nThink of it like a straight\u2011line graph: the common difference is the slope, the first term tells you where the line starts.\n\n---\n\n**Next Practice Question \u2013 Building on What You\u2019ll Learn**\n\nThe sequence below is also arithmetic:\n\n\\[\n-3,\\; 2,\\; 7,\\; 12,\\; \\dots\n\\]\n\n**Part\u202fA** \u2013 *Find the common difference.*  \nWrite a short sentence explaining how you got it.\n\n**Part\u202fB** \u2013",
