The only thing we need to be crystal\u2011clear about is **which vertex the given angle belongs to**.  In most \u201cconstruct a triangle\u201d problems the statement tells you the angle at a particular vertex (e.g., \u201c\u2220B = 45\u00b0\u201d).  If the problem only says \u201cthe angle at the right\u2011hand end of the base,\u201d that means the angle is at the vertex **\\(B\\)** (the right\u2011hand endpoint of \\(AB\\)).  \n\n**Tip to lock it in**  \n- After you draw the base, **label the endpoints** (A on the left, B on the right) and **write the given measurements next to the appropriate points**.  That visual cue will keep you from mixing up which angle goes where, especially when you move on to the next steps (drawing the ray for the angle, locating the third vertex, etc.).  \n\nGreat start!
