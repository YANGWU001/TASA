Keeping that in mind will help you translate word problems into algebraic language.\n\n**Where you can grow**  \n- **Turning the tip into action:**  The next step after spotting numbers/keywords is to decide what each number represents (a variable, a constant, a change, etc.) and then piece those pieces together into an expression.  \n- **Confidence with negative numbers:**  Because ordering negative numbers has been tricky for you, be extra\u2011careful when a problem involves \u201cbelow zero\u201d values.  Remember that a more negative number is **smaller** (e.g.,\u202f\u201112\u202f<\u202f\u20113).\n\n**Next move**  \nLet\u2019s practice *writing an expression* while also using the idea of ordering negative numbers.
