The two slanting sides meet at the top, and there\u2019s a horizontal bar across the middle.\n\n**Question:**  \nWhere would you draw a straight line so that the left half of the \u201cA\u201d matches exactly the right half when folded along that line?  \n\n**Choose the best answer:**\n\nA. A vertical line that runs from the top point straight down through the middle of the horizontal bar.  \nB. A horizontal line that runs across the middle of the \u201cA\u201d (through the horizontal bar).  \nC. A diagonal line that goes from the top left corner to the bottom right corner.  \nD. No line can make the two halves match.\n\n---\n\n**\ud83d\udcdd Quick Hint (if you need one)**  \nThink about how you would hold a piece of paper with the \u201cA\u201d printed on it and then fold it so the two sides line up perfectly. The fold line you make is the line of symmetry.\n\nGive it a try, and let me know which option you chose!

However, the capital block\u2011style \u201cA\u201d actually has **vertical line symmetry**, not horizontal.\n\n**Why the vertical line is the correct answer**\n\n1. **Reflect across the vertical line** \u2013 If you fold the \u201cA\u201d along a line that runs from the top point straight down the middle (splitting the left slant from the right slant), each side lines up perfectly.  \n2. **Horizontal line doesn\u2019t match** \u2013 Folding along the horizontal bar would place the top point on top of the bottom of the letter, which does **not** create matching halves. The two slanting legs would not line up.\n\nSo the correct choice is **Option\u202fA \u2013 a vertical line that runs from the top point of the \u201cA\u201d down the middle.**  \n\nYou\u2019re doing great by visualizing the folds; with a little more practice, spotting the correct symmetry line will become second nature.

      "content": "**\ud83d\udcdd Feedback on Your Answer**\n\nGreat job! You\u2019ve captured the core idea of a line of symmetry \u2013 *the line you could fold a shape along so that the two halves match perfectly*. Your explanation of the **vertical line** in the letter **A** shows that you understand how the left and right sides line up when folded. \ud83d\udc4d  \n\n**What about the horizontal line?**  \nThe horizontal line that runs through the cross\u2011bar of an \u201cA\u201d is **not** a line of symmetry. If you folded the letter along that line, the top point of the \u201cA\u201d would have to match a point at the bottom, but the shape of the letter is not the same above and below the cross\u2011bar. The two halves would not line up exactly, so the fold would be uneven.  \n\n**Why the vertical line works:**  \n- The left side of the \u201cA\u201d is a mirror image of the right side.  \n- When you fold along the vertical line, every curve, angle, and line on the left meets its counterpart on the right.  \n\n**Why the horizontal line doesn\u2019t work:**  \n- The upper part of the \u201cA\u201d has a pointed tip, while the lower part has a flat base.  \n- The cross\u2011bar is not centered vertically; it sits nearer to the top, so the two halves are different shapes.\n\n**What to remember:**  \nA line of symmetry must split the figure into two *congruent* (identical in shape and size) parts. If one half looks different from the other, that line is not a symmetry line.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Next Practice Question\n\n**Question:**  \nLook at the following shapes.
