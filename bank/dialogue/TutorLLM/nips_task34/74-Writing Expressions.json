In everyday language \u201cgives\u201d can feel like a *positive* action (you\u2019re doing something), but mathematically it\u2019s a **loss** of items. Think of it the same way you would treat a \u201cspending\u201d action in a money problem: if you have \\$10 and you **spend** \\$3, the expression is \\(10 - 3\\), not \\(10 + 3\\).\n\nThis is closely related to the skill you\u2019ve been working on with **adding and subtracting negative numbers**.
