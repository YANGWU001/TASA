You\u2019ve identified the two most important pieces of information:\n\n1. **The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is 180\u00b0.**  \n2. **You can write an equation\u202f:**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{\u2220A} + \\text{\u2220B} + \\text{\u2220C} = 180^{\\circ}\n   \\]\n\nThat\u2019s exactly the right thinking process. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nWhat\u2019s missing right now is plugging the *known* angle measures into that equation and then solving for the *unknown* angle. Let\u2019s walk through those next steps together:\n\n| Step | What to do | Why it helps |\n|------|------------|--------------|\n| **1** | Write the equation with the numbers you know. If \u2220A = 45\u00b0 and, say, \u2220B = 70\u00b0, the equation becomes 45\u00b0\u202f+\u202f70\u00b0\u202f+\u202f\u2220C = 180\u00b0. | This makes the unknown (\u2220C) the only thing left to find. |\n| **2** | Add the known angles (45\u00b0\u202f+\u202f70\u00b0 = 115\u00b0). | You now have a simple \u201c115\u00b0\u202f+\u202f\u2220C = 180\u00b0\u201d. |\n| **3** | Subtract the sum of the known angles from 180\u00b0: \u2220C = 180\u00b0\u202f\u2013\u202f115\u00b0 = 65\u00b0. | Isolating the unknown gives you the answer. |\n\nIf any of the numbers are different in the problem you\u2019re working on, just replace them in the same way. The pattern of **(known angles) \u2192 add \u2192 subtract from 180\u00b0** never changes.\n\n**What to try next:**  \nTake the numbers given in the problem you were looking at, plug them into the equation, and finish the calculation. If you get stuck, let me know exactly which numbers you have and I\u2019ll walk through the arithmetic with you.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcda Next Practice Question \u2013 \u201cFind the Missing Angle (with a little twist)\u201d\n\n**Problem**\n\nIn triangle **XYZ**,",
