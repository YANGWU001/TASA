A couple of things to keep in mind for a complete simplification:\n\n1. **Don\u2019t stop at the variables.** After you finish the \\(x\\)-terms, you still need to combine any constant (number\u2011only) terms that are present in the expression.  \n2. **Watch the signs** when the coefficients are negative. Adding a negative number is the same as subtracting its absolute value, so be comfortable with \u201c\\( + (-3) = -3\\)\u201d and \u201c\\( - (-2) = +2\\)\u201d. This is the same skill you struggled with when adding and subtracting negative numbers, and it shows up a lot in \u201ccollect\u2011like\u2011terms\u201d problems.  \n3. **Write the final answer in standard form** (variables first, then the constant), e.g., \\(x + \\text{constant}\\).\n\n**What you missed:** The original problem also had a constant term (\u20117).
