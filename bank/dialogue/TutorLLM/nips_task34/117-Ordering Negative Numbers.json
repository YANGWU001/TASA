However, the task asks you to arrange **all five numbers** from the least (smallest) to the greatest (largest). So we need to place each of the numbers \u20117, \u20112, 3, \u20115, and 0 in the correct order.\n\n**Why \u20117 comes first**\n\nOn a number line, the farther left you go, the smaller the value. Since \u20117 is the farthest left of the numbers you were given, it is indeed the least (smallest) value.\n\n**What comes next?**\n\nAfter \u20117, look for the next number that is still to the right of \u20117 but still negative. Between \u20115, \u20112, 0, and 3, the next \u201cmost negative\u201d value is **\u20115**.
