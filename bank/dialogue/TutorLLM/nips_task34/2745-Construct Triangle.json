In a **SAS (Side\u2011Angle\u2011Side) construction**, however, the base you draw is **one of the given sides**, not a placeholder that has to be longer than anything else.  \n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s happening in this problem:\n\n| What\u2019s given | Why it matters |\n|--------------|----------------|\n| **AB = 6\u202fcm** (one side) | This will be the base you actually draw. |\n| **\u2220BAC = 50\u00b0** (the included angle) | You\u2019ll need to measure this angle at point\u202fA. |\n| **AC = 8\u202fcm** (the other side) | After you have the angle, you\u2019ll swing an 8\u2011cm arc from A to locate point\u202fC. |\n\nSo the correct first step is **to draw the side AB of exactly 6\u202fcm**, not a longer \u201cplaceholder\u201d line. Once AB is in place, you can use your protractor (or the angle\u2011drawing technique you already mastered) to construct the 50\u00b0 angle at A, and then use the compass to mark the 8\u2011cm length.\n\n**What you did well**\n\n* You remembered to write down the numbers \u2013 that\u2019s a strong habit and will keep you organized.  \n* You\u2019re thinking about the relationship between the sides, which is great preparation for later problems (e.g., checking the triangle inequality).\n\n**What to adjust**\n\n* Draw the **exact given side** as the base.  \n* Use the angle",

You\u2019re already making solid progress:\n\n| What you did well | Why it matters |\n|-------------------|----------------|\n| **Wrote down the given lengths (AB\u202f=\u202f6\u202fcm, AC\u202f=\u202f8\u202fcm).** | Putting the data on paper keeps you organized and prevents a simple slip\u2011up later on. |\n| **Recognised that the \u201cbase\u201d can be any one of the given sides** (you chose AB). | The base is just the first segment you draw; it doesn\u2019t have to be the longest side. |\n| **Identified the 50\u00b0 angle at A** and thought about how to make it with a protractor. | Spotting the correct vertex for the given angle is the key step before you start drawing. |\n\n---\n\n### Where you can tighten up\n\n1. **Protractor positioning** \u2013  \n   Remember that a protractor has a **baseline (the straight edge)** that must be **aligned with the side you already drew** (here, AB). The **center hole** of the protractor must sit exactly on the vertex A. Then you read the marks on the protractor to open the required angle.\n\n2. **Choosing the right side of the angle** \u2013  \n   A 50\u00b0 angle can be drawn on either side of AB. In a triangle\u2011construction problem you usually pick the side that will allow the third vertex (C) to be reachable by the given length (8\u202fcm). If you draw the angle on the \u201cwrong\u201d side, the 8\u202fcm compass swing may not intersect the ray you just created.\n\n3. **Using a compass after the angle** \u2013  \n   Once the 50\u00b0 ray is drawn, you\u2019ll need a compass set to **8\u202fcm** (the length of AC) and swing an arc from A. Then set the compass to **6\u202fcm** (the length of AB) and swing an",
