Then read the numbers from left\u2011most to right\u2011most.\n\nSince you weren\u2019t sure how to begin, let\u2019s try a short, step\u2011by\u2011step example together before you tackle the next question:\n\n1. **Write the numbers down.**  \n2. **Identify the signs** (\u2011 or +).  \n3. **Group the negatives** \u2013 the one with the greatest absolute value (the biggest distance from zero) is the *most negative* (the smallest).  \n4. **Place 0** in the middle.  \n5. **List the positives** from smallest to largest.\n\nYou can practice this mental \u201cnumber\u2011line\u201d trick with the next problem.

Let\u2019s look at the ordering you gave:\n\nYou wrote: **\u201112, \u20113, \u20117, \u20111, 4**\n\n**What\u2019s happening?**  \nWhen we order integers from *smallest* (most negative) to *largest* (most positive), we need to compare how far each number is to the left on the number line. The farther left, the smaller the value.\n\n- **\u201112** is indeed the smallest \u2013 it\u2019s the farthest left. \u2705  \n- Next, you placed **\u20113** before **\u20117**. On a number line, \u20117 is *more* to the left than \u20113, so \u20117 should come **before** \u20113.  \n- After that, you had **\u20117, \u20111**, which is correct in relative order (\u20117\u202f<\u202f\u20111).  \n- Finally, **4** is the only positive number, so it correctly ends the list.\n\n**Correct ordering:**  \n**\u201112, \u20117, \u20113, \u20111, 4**\n\nSo you were only off by swapping the positions of \u20113 and \u20117. That\u2019s a common slip because the negatives are \u201cbackwards\u201d compared to the positives. Keep visualizing a number line, and you\u2019ll catch those swaps more easily.\n\n**What to keep doing**\n\n1. **Visual cue:** Imagine a horizontal line with 0 in the middle. Place each negative number to the left of 0, spacing them according to their absolute value",

For ordering numbers, especially negatives, the trick is to remember that \u201cmore negative = smaller.\u201d In other words, the number that is farthest to the left on a number line is the smallest, and the one farthest to the right is the largest.\n\nYou\u2019ve already shown you can read a list of numbers and try to put them in order (you attempted that earlier). The next step is to **compare each pair of numbers** and decide which one comes first. A quick visual aid\u2014drawing a short number line\u2014can make the comparisons much easier.\n\nLet\u2019s try a new practice problem together.
