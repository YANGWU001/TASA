Recognizing that you\u2019re not sure is the first step toward mastering a new skill.  \n\nWhen a problem feels stuck, a good strategy is to **break it into smaller, familiar pieces**. For elapsed\u2011time questions we usually:\n\n1. **Convert the clock times to minutes** (or to a 24\u2011hour format) so you\u2019re working with one unit only.  \n2. **Subtract the earlier time from the later time**.  \n3. If the minutes part of the later time is smaller than the minutes part of the start time, **borrow 60 minutes** (just like you\u2019d borrow 1 hour in regular subtraction).\n\nYou\u2019ve already worked with **perimeter** (adding lengths around a shape) and **vectors/translation** (moving points around a coordinate grid). Think of elapsed time the same way: you\u2019re \u201cmoving\u201d from a start moment to an end moment, and you want to know **how far you traveled in minutes**.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through the example together so you can see the steps in action.  \n\n---\n\n### Worked Example (the problem we just asked)\n\n> Emma started her homework at **3:45\u202fPM** and finished at **5:20\u202fPM**.  \n> How many minutes did she spend working?\n\n**Step\u202f1 \u2013 Write the times in \u201chours\u202f:\u202fminutes\u201d.**  \n- Start: 3\u202fhours\u202f45\u202fminutes  \n- End:   5\u202fhours\u202f20\u202fminutes  \n\n**Step\u202f2 \u2013 Subtract the start time from the end time.**  \n\n|   | Hours",
