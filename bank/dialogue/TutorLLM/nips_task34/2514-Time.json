Let\u2019s check the calculation together:\n\n1. **Start time:**\u202f7:20\u202fAM  \n2. **Add the hour component (1\u202fhour):**\u202f7:20\u202fAM \u2192 **8:20\u202fAM**  \n3. **Add the minute component (35\u202fminutes):**  \n   - 8:20\u202fAM + 30\u202fminutes = **8:50\u202fAM**  \n   - 8:50\u202fAM + 5\u202fminutes = **8:55\u202fAM**\n\nSo the correct arrival time is **8:55\u202fAM**, not 9:05\u202fAM.
