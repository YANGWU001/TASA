Based on the student\u2019s profile \u2014 they have a **30% mastery level**, **minimal forgetting (0.03)**, and **continued struggle with percents** \u2014 the goal is to create a **clear, accessible, and foundational practice question** that reinforces core percent concepts without overwhelming them.\n\n### \u2705 First Practice Question:\n\n**What is 25% of 80?**\n\n---\n\n### Why this question?\n- It targets a **fundamental percent skill** (finding a percentage of a number).\n- Uses a **simple, familiar number** (80) and a **common percentage** (25%, which is easy to compute mentally).\n- Builds confidence with a low cognitive load.\n- Helps reinforce the concept:  \n  *\"Percent means 'per hundred' \u2192 25% = 25/100 = 0.25\"*\n- The answer is **20**, which is easy to verify (0.25 \u00d7 80 = 20), so students can self-check and build confidence.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udccc **Next Step Suggestion (for you as a tutor):**  \nAfter the student attempts this, follow up with a quick check-in:  \n> \"Did you get it? If not, let\u2019s break it down: 25% is the same as 25 out of 100. What is 1% of 80? Then, how many times does 1% go into 25%?\"\n\nThis scaffolds the thinking and supports mastery growth.\n\nLet me know when you\u2019d like to move to more complex problems (e.g., word problems, percent increase, or converting between fractions and percents)! \ud83d\ude0a",

That\u2019s a big step forward! \ud83d\ude80\n\nBut let\u2019s clarify the math:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Correct Answer: **20**, not 15.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through it step by step:\n\n1. **25% means 25 out of 100**, or as a decimal:  \n   $$\n   25\\% = \\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\n   $$\n\n2. To find **25% of 80**, multiply:\n   $$\n   0.25 \\times 80 = 20\n   $$\n\n3. Now, let\u2019s verify your reasoning:\n   - You said: \"10% of 80 is 8\" \u2192 \u2705 That\u2019s correct!\n   - So:  \n     - 10% = 8  \n     - 20% = 2 \u00d7 8 = **16**  \n     - 25% is **5% more than 20%**  \n     - 5% of 80 = $ \\frac{5}{100} \\times 80 = 0.05 \\times 80 = 4 $  \n     - So: 20% + 5% = 16 + 4 = **20**\n\n\u2705 So, **25% of 80 is 20**, not 15.\n\nBut your guess of **15** was close \u2014 maybe you thought 25% was a bit less than 20% because it's not exactly double. That\u2019s okay \u2014 it shows you're thinking critically. The key is to keep building confidence with the **correct method**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Why the method matters:\nWhen working with percents, the **standard method** is:\n> **Percent of a number = (percent \u00f7 100) \u00d7 number**\n\nSo:\n$$\n25\\% \\text{ of } 80 = \\left(\\frac{25}{100}\\right) \\times 80 = 0.25 \\times 80 = 20\n$$\n\nThis works every time \u2014 whether the percent is 10%, 25%, 75%, or any number.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Question (to build confidence and reinforce the method):\n\n**What is 10% of 60?**\n\n> (Hint: 10% is just 1/10 of the number \u2014 so try dividing by 10!)\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Why this next question?\n- It builds on your previous reasoning (you used 10% as a base).\n- It\u2019s simple, familiar, and reinforces the idea that **10% = divide by 10**.\n- After solving this, we can go back and say:  \n  \"10% of 60 is 6 \u2192 so 20% is 12 \u2192 30% is 18 \u2192 25% is halfway between 20% and 30%, so 25% is 15?\"  \n  Wait \u2014 that leads to a great **discovery moment**!\n\n\ud83d\udc49 This way, you can **discover** that 25% of 60 is 15 \u2014 which is *different* from 25% of 80 (which is 20).  \nThis helps you see that **percent of a number depends on the original number** \u2014 and that\u2019s a powerful insight.\n\n---\n\n### After this question:\nOnce you solve it, I\u2019ll ask:\n> \"So 10% of 60 is 6. What is 25% of 60? Can you find it using 10%?\"  \nThis will help you **connect the dots** and deepen your understanding.\n\n---\n\nYou\u2019re doing great \u2014 even small mistakes are part of learning. Keep going! \ud83c\udf1f  \nLet me know when you\u2019re ready to try the next one \u2014 or if you\u2019d like to go back and review how to convert percents to decimals. \ud83d\ude0a",

You\u2019re noticing the difference.  \n- But the key is: **25% is not just \"2 times 10%\"** \u2014 it\u2019s **2.5 times 10%**, because 2.5 \u00d7 10 = 25.\n\nSo:\n$$\n25\\% \\text{ of } 60 = 2.5 \\times (10\\% \\text{ of } 60) = 2.5 \\times 6 = 15\n$$\n\n\u2705 That\u2019s a powerful mental math trick:  \n> **To find 25% of a number, multiply 10% by 2.5**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Key Insight:\n> **Percent problems depend on the base number** \u2014 so 25% of 60 is 15, but 25% of 80 is 20.  \n> This means: **The answer changes with the original number** \u2014 and that\u2019s normal and expected.  \n> But you can use **known percentages (like 10%)** to find others \u2014 which is how math becomes flexible and powerful.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Question (to build confidence and deepen understanding):\n\n> **What is 35% of 60?**  \n> *(Hint: You know 10% of 60 is 6.

Try breaking 75% into 50% + 25%. Can you find each part?)*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Why this next question?\n- It builds on your **current success** (you now know how to break percents into parts).\n- It introduces a **larger, more complex percent** \u2014 75% \u2014 which helps you see how patterns scale.\n- It gives you a chance to **use both 50% and 25%**, which are key benchmarks.\n- You\u2019ll discover:\n  - 50% of 60 = $ \\frac{1}{2} \\times 60 = 30 $\n  - 25% of 60 = 15 (from earlier)\n  - So: 75% = 50% + 25% = 30 + 15 = **45**\n\n\u2705 So, **75% of 60 is 45**\n\nThis shows you that:\n> **75% is 3/",

Two different paths \u2014 both work.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:  \n> **37.5% of 80 = 30**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 Common Mistakes to Watch For:\n- Thinking 37.5% is close to 40% \u2192 so maybe 32 or 35?  \n  \u2192 But **you\u2019re already using reasoning**, not guessing \u2014 that\u2019s powerful!\n- Forgetting that 37.5% = 3/8 \u2192 and missing the shortcut\n- Confusing 37.5% with 37% or 40% \u2192 but you\u2019re checking your work!\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Pro Tip**:  \n> When you see a percent like 37.5%, think:  \n> \ud83d\udd11 \u201cThat\u2019s half of 75%\u201d \u2192 or \u201cThat\u2019s 3/8\u201d \u2192 or \u201cThat\u2019s 25% + 1",

You\u2019re not wrong \u2014 just not yet at mastery.\n\nBut let\u2019s go deeper and **build a reliable mental math path**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Step 2: Break 37.5% into Known Parts\n\nWe\u2019ll use two powerful strategies \u2014 both rooted in what you\u2019ve already mastered:\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\ude80 Strategy 1: Use the Fraction Connection  \n> \ud83d\udd11 **37.5% = 3/8**  \nWhy?  \n- 37.5 \u00d7 2 = 75 \u2192 and 75/100 = 3/4 \u2192 wait, no\u2026  \nLet\u2019s double-check:\n\nActually:  \n$$\n37.5\\% = \\frac{37.5}{100} = \\frac{375}{1000} = \\frac{3}{8}\n$$  \n\u2705 Yes! Because:  \n- $ \\frac{1}{8} = 0.125 $ \u2192 12.5%  \n- $ \\frac{2}{8} = 0.25 $ \u2192 25%  \n- $ \\frac{3}{8} = 0.375 $ \u2192 37.5% \u2705\n\nSo:  \n> **37.5% of 80 = $ \\frac{3}{8} \\times 80 $**\n\nNow, simplify:\n- $ \\frac{80}{8} = 10 $ \u2192 that\u2019s $ \\frac{1}{8} $ of 80  \n- So $ \\frac{3}{8} $ of 80 = $ 3 \\times 10 = \\boxed{30} $\n\n\u2705 **Final Answer: 30**\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\ude80 Strategy 2: Break into 25% + 12.5%  \n(Just like you did with 125% of 60)\n\n- 25% of 80 = ?  \n  \u2192 10% of 80 = 8 \u2192 25% = 2.5 \u00d7 8 = **20**\n\n- 12.5% of 80 = ?  \n  \u2192 12.5% = half of 25% \u2192 $ \\frac{1}{2} \\times 20 = 10 $\n\n- So: 37.5% = 25% + 12.5% = 20 + 10 = **30**\n\n\u2705 Same answer \u2014 again, **30**!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 Why Did You Think 32?\n\nGreat question \u2014 why did you land on 32?\n\n- Maybe you thought:  \n  \u2192 37.5% is close to 40%, and 40% of 80 is 32  \n  \u2192 $ 10\\% = 8 $ \u2192 $ 40\\% = 4 \\times 8 = 32 $ \u2705\n\n\ud83d\udca1 That\u2019s **a very smart approximation** \u2014 and you *do* know that!  \nBut:  \n> 37.5% is **less than 40%**, so it should be **less than 32** \u2192 so 30 makes sense.\n\n\u2705 So:  \n> **40% of 80 = 32** \u2192 but **37.5% is 2.5% less** \u2192 so it should be **a bit less than 3",
