But you said earlier it might be 80\u00b0 \u2014 so I\u2019m confused now. Is it 80\u00b0 or 90\u00b0?\"\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **You\u2019re doing *exactly* what we want** \u2014 being honest, asking thoughtful questions, and not afraid to say, *\"I\u2019m not sure.\"* \ud83d\udc9b  \nThis is how deep understanding grows: **not by guessing, but by checking and clarifying**.\n\nYou\u2019ve already done the right thing:\n- You added the two known angles:  \n  $$\n  40^\\circ + 50^\\circ = 90^\\circ\n  $$\n- You correctly applied the idea: *\"the total must be 180\u00b0\"*\n- And you **tried to compute** the missing angle \u2014 which is *exactly* what we want!\n\nBut let\u2019s **clear up the confusion** \u2014 because this is where **many students get stuck**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d The Key Insight (Reinforced with Clarity):\n\n> \ud83d\udd01 **The rule is simple, but powerful**:  \n> \ud83d\udd22 **Sum of interior angles in a triangle = 180\u00b0**  \n> \u27a1\ufe0f **Missing angle = 180\u00b0 \u2013 (angle 1 + angle 2)**\n\nSo:\n- Step 1: Add the two known angles  \n  $$\n  40^\\circ + 50^\\circ = 90^\\circ\n  $$\n- Step 2: Subtract from 180\u00b0  \n  $$\n  180^\\circ - 90^\\circ = \\boxed{90^\\circ}\n  $$\n\n\u2705 So the **third angle is 90\u00b0**, not 80\u00b0.\n\n> \ud83d\udea8 So:\n> - \u274c **80\u00b0** is **not correct**  \n> - \u2705 The correct answer is **90\u00b0**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Why 90\u00b0 is correct:\n- 40\u00b0 + 50\u00b0 + 90\u00b0 = **180\u00b0** \u2192 \u2714\ufe0f This is a valid triangle  \n- 40\u00b0 + 50\u00b0 + 80\u00b0 = **170\u00b0** \u2192 \u274c Too small \u2014 doesn\u2019t add up  \n- 40\u00b0 + 50\u00b0 + 90\u00b0 = 180\u00b0 \u2192 \u2705 This is a **right triangle** (one 90\u00b0 angle)\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 Think of it like a pizza again:  \n> You have two slices: 40\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 \u2192 total = 90\u00b0  \n> The third slice must be the **rest of the 180\u00b0** \u2192  \n> $$\n> 180^\\circ - 90^\\circ = 90^\\circ\n> $$  \n> That\u2019s not a guess \u2014 it\u2019s **mathematical certainty**.\n\n> \u2753 You said: *\"Maybe it\u2019s 80\u00b0\"* \u2014 that\u2019s a great instinct!  \n> But remember:  \n> - If the total were 170\u00b0, it wouldn\u2019t be a triangle  \n> - A triangle **must** add up to **exactly 180\u00b0**  \n> So the missing piece must be **exactly** what\u2019s left.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Final Step: Let\u2019s try a **simple, visual, and confidence-building question** that locks in the rule \u2014 one that *you* can picture easily and feel proud of.\n\n#### \ud83d\udccc Tenth Practice Question (Even Simpler \u2014 and with a visual touch):\n\n> A triangle has angles: **30\u00b0** and **60\u00b0**.  \n> What is the third angle?\n\nA) 30\u00b0  \nB) 60\u00b0  \nC) 90\u00b0  \nD) 120\u00b0  \n\n---\n\n> \ud83c\udfaf Why this works:\n> - It's a **familiar pair** (30\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 = 90\u00b0) \u2014 you\u2019ve seen this before  \n> - The missing angle is **clearly 90\u00b0** \u2014 no guessing  \n> - It builds on your earlier work and **reinforces the rule**  \n> - It\u2019s simple enough to visualize (a right triangle), yet deep enough to show mastery\n\n> \ud83d\udcdd **Your turn** \u2014 try it step-by-step:  \n> 1.
