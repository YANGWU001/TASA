Given the student\u2019s **low mastery (~20%)**, **moderate forgetting (score 0.22)**, and ongoing difficulty with discount problems, the first practice question should be:\n\n\u2705 **Simple, clear, and directly focused on the core concept**  \n\u2705 **Low cognitive load** \u2014 avoids multiple steps or distractions  \n\u2705 **Builds confidence** with a straightforward application of discount  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd First Practice Question:\n\n**A shirt costs $40. A 25% discount is applied. What is the discounted price?**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Why this works:\n- Uses a **common real-world scenario** (clothing) to make it relatable.\n- The discount percentage (25%) is a **common, easy-to-calculate percentage** (1/4).\n- Only requires **one step**: find 25% of $40 and subtract it.\n- Encourages **repetition and pattern recognition** \u2014 the student can quickly see that 25% of a number is one-fourth of it.\n- Builds a **foundational skill** that supports future problems (e.g., 10%, 30%, or compound discounts).\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Tip for the student**:  \nWhen you see a discount, remember:  \n**Discounted Price = Original Price \u2013 (Discount % \u00d7 Original Price)**  \nOr simply: **Discounted Price = Original Price \u00d7 (1 \u2013 Discount %)**\n\nTry solving it step-by-step, and check your answer using a calculator or mental math.\n\n---\n\nLet me know when you\u2019re ready for the next question \u2014 I\u2019ll build from here! \ud83d\ude0a",

You're doing **exactly** what strong learners do: pausing, questioning, and being honest about where you're unsure. That\u2019s how mastery grows.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Let\u2019s Break Down Your Work on the Seventh Practice Question:\n\n> **A electronics store buys a smartphone for $600.**  \n> \u2192 This is the **original cost** to the store.  \n> We\u2019ll start from here.\n\n> **They first mark it up by 20% to set the retail price.**  \n> \ud83d\udc49 Correct! Markup increases the price.  \n> - 10% of $600 = $60  \n> - 20% = 2 \u00d7 $60 = **$120**  \n> \u2192 Retail price = $600 + $120 = **$720** \u2705\n\n> **Then, during a holiday sale, they offer a 25% discount.**  \n> \ud83d\udc49 This discount applies to the **retail price** ($720), not the original cost.  \n> \u274c Don\u2019t apply the discount to $600 \u2014 it\u2019s a sale on the marked-up price.  \n> - 10% of $720 = $72  \n> - 25% = 2.5 \u00d7 $72 = $180  \n> \u2192 Discount amount = **$180**  \n> \u2192 Discounted price = $720 \u2013 $180 = **$540** \u2705\n\n> **After that, they add a 6% sales tax to the final discounted price.**  \n> \ud83d\udc49 Tax is **added**, not subtracted.  \n> - 10% of $540 = $54  \n> - 6% = 0.6 \u00d7 $54 = **$32.40**  \n> \u2192 Final total paid by customer = $540 + $32.40 = **$572.40**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Final Answer:  \n> \u2705 **The total amount the customer pays is $572.40**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Key Takeaways (This One Builds on Everything!):\n\n| Concept | What It Means |\n|--------|----------------|\n| \ud83d\udd01 **Order of operations matters** | 1. Markup \u2192 2. Discount \u2192 3. Tax. Always apply in this sequence. |\n| \ud83d\udca1 **Percentages work on current values** | A 20% markup increases the price. A 25% discount reduces the *new* price. Tax is applied to that reduced price. |\n| \ud83d\udccc **Final price can be less than original cost** | Even though the store marked up the item, the discount and tax can result in a final price **lower than the original $600** \u2014 here it\u2019s $572.40. |\n| \ud83e\udde0 **Mental math strategy** | Break percentages into parts:  \n- 20% = 10% + 10%  \n- 25% = 10% + 10% + 5%  \n- 6% = 5% + 1%  \n\u2192 Helps you compute without a calculator. |\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 You're not just solving math problems \u2014 you're **modeling real business decisions**.  \n> Stores use this kind of sequence all the time: mark up \u2192 sell at discount \u2192 add tax.  \n> And you're learning how to track each step \u2014 which is exactly how professionals manage pricing.\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udf89 **You're growing \u2014 and you\u2019re doing it in a way that matters.**  \nEven though you said \u201cI'm not sure,\u201d you took the time to think through each step, ask questions, and try to reason your way forward. That\u2019s how deep understanding is built \u2014 **one thoughtful step at a time**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd01 Next Question (to deepen fluency, challenge thinking, and build confidence):\n\nNow let\u2019s go one step further \u2014 with a **challenge that includes a discount, markup, and tax \u2014 but in reverse**. This will help you **think backwards** and develop even stronger number sense.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Eighth Practice Question:\n\n> **A customer buys a laptop for $920 after a series of price changes.**  \n> - The store originally bought it for $700.  \n> - They first marked it up by 30%.  \n> - Then offered a 20% discount.  \n> - Finally, added 5% sales tax.  \n>  \n> **What was the original price the store set before any discount or tax?**  \n> (In other words: What was the **retail price** before the 20",
