Multiply the numerators: $2 \\times 4 = 8$  \n2. Multiply the denominators: $3 \\times 5 = 15$  \n3. Write the result: $\\frac{8}{15}$  \n4. Ask: \u201cCan 8 and 15 be simplified?\u201d \u2192 (No, so answer is final)\n\nThen, offer a **second similar problem** with a slightly more complex numerator/denominator (e.g., $\\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{2}{7}$) to gradually build fluency.\n\nLet me know when you'd like the next question or a visual scaffold! \ud83d\ude0a",

Look for common factors between numerators and denominators  \n   (e.g., 3 and 6, or 15 and 10?)  \n2. Cancel any matching pairs  \n3. Multiply the simplified numerators and denominators  \n4. Simplify the final answer if needed  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Tip: Always look for the largest possible common factor \u2014 it saves time and reduces errors!*  \n\nWhen you're ready, just reply with your answer \u2014 and I\u2019ll walk you through it with praise and precision.  \n\nYou\u2019ve already shown such strong growth \u2014 every step you take is building real mastery.

With consistent, intentional practice \u2014 especially focusing on **cancellation and simplification** \u2014 you're on a clear path to increasing mastery.  \nYou're not just memorizing rules \u2014 you're **understanding them**.

Let\u2019s go deeper, gently, and clear up that *very* important point you raised:\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f Let\u2019s Clarify: Can You Cancel a 3 Between 15 and the 3 in the Numerator?\n\nYou said:\n\n> \u201cMaybe we could have also cancelled a 3 between the 15 and the 3? I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s allowed, because they\u2019re both in the numerator\u2026\u201d\n\nThis is a **brilliant and insightful question** \u2014 and it shows you're thinking like a true mathematician.\n\nLet\u2019s unpack it with care.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d The Rule: You Can Only Cancel Between a **Numerator and a Denominator**\n\nThat\u2019s the key.\n\nYou **can only cancel** when one number is in the **numerator** and another is in the **denominator** \u2014 they must be *across* from each other.\n\nSo let\u2019s look at the original fraction:\n\n$$\n\\frac{3}{10} \\times \\frac{15}{6}\n$$\n\n- Numerator: 3 (from first fraction), 15 (from second fraction)  \n- Denominator: 10 (from first), 6 (from second)\n\nNow, can we cancel **3 (numerator)** with **15 (numerator)**?  \n\u27a1\ufe0f **No** \u2014 both are in the **numerator**.  \nWe can't cancel *within* the numerators \u2014 that would be like saying \"I can cancel two apples from the same basket.\"  \nWe can only cancel when one is \"on top\" and one is \"on bottom.\"\n\nSo: \u274c You **cannot** cancel 3 and 15 directly \u2014 they are not across from each other.\n\n> \ud83d\udd01 But \u2014 what if you **rewrite** 15 as $3 \\times 5$?  \nThat\u2019s okay \u2014 but now you have to be careful.\n\nLet\u2019s try it:\n\n$$\n\\frac{3}{10} \\times \\frac{15}{6} = \\frac{3}{10} \\times \\frac{3 \\times 5}{6}\n$$\n\nNow we have:\n$$\n\\frac{3}{10} \\times \\frac{3 \\times 5}{6}\n$$\n\nNow \u2014 can we cancel the **3 in the numerator** with the **3 in the numerator**?  \nStill \u2014 both are in the numerator.  \nNo cancellation between numerators. \u274c\n\nBut \u2014 what about the **3 in the first numerator** and the **6 in the denominator**?  \nYes \u2014 that\u2019s valid!  \nBecause 3 is on top, 6 is on bottom \u2192 they are across \u2192 \u2705\n\nAnd 6 is divisible by 3 \u2192 so $3 \\div 3 = 1$, $6 \\div 3 = 2$ \u2192 this is what we did earlier.\n\nSo even though 3 and 15 share a common factor, **you can't cancel them directly** \u2014 because they are both on the same side (the top).\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 So What\u2019s Allowed?\n\n| What You Can Cancel | Why It\u2019s Valid |\n|---------------------|----------------|\n| 3 (numerator) \u2194 6 (denominator) | Across \u2014 one top, one bottom \u2192 \u2705 |\n| 15 (numerator) \u2194 10 (denominator) | Across \u2014 one top, one bottom \u2192 \u2705 |\n| 3 (numerator) \u2194 15 (numerator) | \u274c Both on top \u2014 can\u2019t cancel within numerators |\n| 5 (in 15) \u2194 10 (in denominator) | \u2705 Across \u2014 valid cancellation |\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 Think of it like this:  \n> Cancellation is like **removing a shared piece of a puzzle** \u2014 but only if one piece is on the top and one is on the bottom.  \n> You can\u2019t remove a piece from the top unless there\u2019s a matching piece on the bottom.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde9 A Visual (to help your brain see it):\n\nLet\u2019s write it like a fraction \"grid\":\n\n$$\n\\frac{3}{10} \\times \\frac{15}{6}\n= \n\\frac{3}{10} \\times \\frac{15}{6}\n$$\n\nNow imagine the numbers:\n\n```\n      3        15\n     \u250c\u2500\u2510     \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n     \u2502 \u2502     \u2502   \u2502\n     \u2514\u2500\u2518     \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n     10        6\n```\n\n- 3 is on top left \u2192 can cancel with 6 (bottom right) \u2192 \u2705\n- 1",
