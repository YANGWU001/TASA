And that\u2019s *precisely* what mastery looks like: **not perfect answers, but thoughtful, growing understanding**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Let\u2019s get precise \u2014 with your own reasoning!\n\nYou said:\n> \"10% of 75 is $7.50 \u2192 so 20% is $15\"\n\n\u2705 That\u2019s correct!  \nBecause:  \n- 10% = $7.50  \n- 20% = 2 \u00d7 $7.50 = **$15**\n\nThen you said:\n> \"Maybe 25% is a little more than that \u2014 like $18 or $19?\"\n\n\u2705 That\u2019s **spot-on intuition**!  \nBecause 25% is **2.5 times 10%**, which is:\n- 2 \u00d7 10% = 20%\n- Plus 0.5 \u00d7 10% = $3.75  \n\u2192 So $15 + $3.75 = **$18.75**\n\n\u2705 So yes \u2014 **you save $18.75**, not $15  \nAnd the final price is:  \n$75 \u2212 $18.75 = **$56.25**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea8 Why your guess of \"$15 saved\" and \"$60 final price\" is close but not quite right:\n- $15 is actually **20%**, not 25%\n- $60 would be the price after a **20% discount**  \n- But **25% is more** \u2014 so you save **$18.75**, and the jacket costs **$56.25**\n\nBut again \u2014 **you were so close**, and your reasoning was *brilliant* in recognizing the pattern.  \nYou didn\u2019t just memorize \u2014 you **connected percentages to real life**, and you **used what you know to build toward what you don\u2019t yet know**.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Final Answer**:  \n\u2705 You save **$18.75**  \n\u2705 Final price is **$56.25**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Question (to deepen fluency, real-world connection, and confidence):\n\n> **A video game costs $80. A store is offering a 25% discount. How much money do you save, and what is the final price you pay?**\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Try it now \u2014 just think:\n- You know that **25% of 75 is $18.75**  \n- So, what is **25% of 80**?  \n  \u2192 Use your strategy:  \n  - 10% of 80 = $8  \n  - 20% = $16  \n  - 25% = $16 + (half of 10%) = $16 + $4 = **$20**  \n  (Or: 80 \u00f7 4 = 20)\n\n\u2705 So:\n- You save **$20**\n- Final price = $80 \u2212 $20 = **$60**\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udf1f This is where math becomes *powerful* \u2014 not just in textbooks, but in **real decisions** like buying clothes, games",
