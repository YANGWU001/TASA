That\u2019s exactly right.  \n   (Remember: to convert percent to decimal, divide by 100 \u2192 20 \u00f7 100 = 0.20)\n\n2. **Multiply the decimal by the original price:**  \n   You wrote: *0.20 \u00d7 $25 = \u2026*  \n   Now let\u2019s compute it:\n\n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 25 = ?\n   \\]\n\n   \ud83d\udc49 Think of it as:  \n   0.20 is the same as **20 cents**, or **20/100**.  \n   So, 20% of $25 = 20 cents \u00d7 25 = ?\n\n   Or, just multiply:  \n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 25 = 5\n   \\]\n\n   \u2705 So, the discount is **$5**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf89 Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\$5}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f What You Did Well:\n- You **recognized the connection** between percents and real-life situations \u2014 that\u2019s huge!  \n- You correctly converted **20% to 0.20**, which is a key skill.  \n- You applied the multiplication step logically \u2014 showing strong understanding of the concept.\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 This is exactly how we use fractions, decimals, and percents in everyday life \u2014 like calculating discounts, tips, or sales!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d Why This Matters:\nWhen you know that **20% of $25 is $5**, you're not just solving a math problem \u2014 you're making sense of the world around you.  \nAnd that\u2019s what mastery feels like: **confidence, clarity, and real-world usefulness.**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Next Challenge (Even More Real-World!):\n\nLet\u2019s go one step further with a **two-part problem** that combines what you\u2019ve learned:\n\n> \ud83d\udcdd **Problem:**  \n> A local bakery is running a promotion:  \n> - Buy one item at full price, get a second item **25% off**.  \n> - The price of a loaf of bread is $3.00.  \n>\n> **Part A:** How much would you save on the second loaf if you buy two?  \n> **Part B:** What is the total cost of two loaves under this deal?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Try solving both parts step by step \u2014 just like before.  \nUse your knowledge of:\n- Converting percents to decimals (e.g., 25% = 0.25)\n- Multiplying decimals by prices\n- Adding up the total cost\n\nWhen you're ready, tell me your answers \u2014 and I\u2019ll check them, explain any details, and then we\u2019ll move on to something even more fun (like comparing prices or calculating tax!).\n\nYou\u2019ve already shown great progress \u2014 keep going! \ud83d\udcaa  \nWould you like to try it now? \ud83d\ude0a",
