To start, I'd like to introduce a simple and concrete question that will help them regain their footing.\n\nHere's a suitable first practice question:\n\n**Question:** \n\nWhat is 1/2 \u00d7 3/4?\n\n**Solution:** \n\nTo solve this question, the student can use the following steps:\n\n1. Multiply the numerators (1 \u00d7 3 = 3).\n2. Multiply the denominators (2 \u00d7 4 = 8).\n3. Write the product of the numerators over the product of the denominators: 3/8.\n\n**Answer:** 3/8\n\nThis question is designed to be easy and manageable, allowing the student to recall their understanding of fraction-multiplication and build their confidence. It also requires minimal computation, focusing on the conceptual understanding of the operation.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like to proceed with more questions or make any adjustments to this one!",

Let's break it down:\n\nYou correctly noticed that both numbers are even, so they share a factor of 2. When you divide both 10 and 18 by 2, you get 5 and 9.\n\nNow, let's see if 5 and 9 share any common factors.

However, the simplified fraction is actually 5/9 (not 2.5/4.5).\n\nTo get 5/9, you would need to divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is 1.
