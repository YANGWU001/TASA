You're right that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180\u00b0, and you're correct that you need to include the unknown angle x\u00b0 in the sum.\n\nThink of it like this: if you have 20\u00b0 and 80\u00b0, and you add x\u00b0, the total must be 180\u00b0. You don't need to subtract x\u00b0 to find the sum; you need to add it.\n\nThe correct equation would be:\n\n20\u00b0 + 80\u00b0 + x\u00b0 = 180\u00b0\n\nSince you already know that 20\u00b0 + 80\u00b0 = 100\u00b0, you can rewrite the equation as:\n\n100\u00b0 + x\u00b0 = 180\u00b0\n\nTo find x\u00b0, you would subtract 100\u00b0 from both sides of the equation:\n\nx\u00b0 = 180\u00b0 - 100\u00b0\nx\u00b0 = 80\u00b0\n\nSo, the unknown angle x\u00b0 is actually 80\u00b0.\n\nThe correct answer is actually **D) 180\u00b0**. The sum of the interior angles of the triangle is always 180\u00b0, regardless of the individual angle measurements.\n\nHere's another question to help reinforce your understanding:\n\n**Question:** What is the sum of the interior angles of a triangle with angles measuring 30\u00b0, 90\u00b0, and y\u00b0?\n\n**A)** 180\u00b0 - y\u00b0\n**B)** 180\u00b0 + y\u00b0\n**C)** 360\u00b0 - y\u00b0\n**D)** 180\u00b0\n\nTake your time, and see if you can apply what you've learned to find the correct answer.",
