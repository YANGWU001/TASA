The answer can be found by multiplying the numerators (1 \u00d7 1 = 1) and multiplying the denominators (2 \u00d7 4 = 8), resulting in 1/8.\n\n**Guidelines for the student:**\n\n1. Multiply the numerators (1 \u00d7 1).\n2. Multiply the denominators (2 \u00d7 4).\n3. Write the answer as a fraction in its simplest form (1/8).\n\nThis question will help the student regain their basic understanding of fraction-multiplication and build a strong foundation for future practice.",

I\u2019m not sure if 3 and 32 share any common factor, but I think they might both be divisible by 4? If I divide numerator and denominator by 4 I\u2019d get (3\u00f74)/(32\u00f74) = 3/8\u2026 that can\u2019t be right because 3\u202f\u00f7\u202f4 isn\u2019t an integer.  \n\nSo I guess I\u2019ll just leave it as 3/12, which I think simplifies to 1/4.  \n\n**My answer:** 1/4 (I\u2019m not"

    "content": "**Tutor:** I see that you're thinking carefully about the problem, and you're trying to simplify the fraction. However, there are a few small mistakes in your reasoning.\n\nFirstly, you correctly multiplied the numerators and denominators, which gave you the fraction 3/32.\n\nThen, you thought about simplifying the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 4. This is a great approach! However, you correctly observed that 3 is not divisible by 4, but you incorrectly stated that 32 is divisible by 4. 32 is actually divisible by 4, and if you divide both the numerator and the denominator by 4, you get:\n\n(3 \u00f7 4) / (32 \u00f7 4) = 3/8\n\nThis is actually the correct simplified fraction! So, the answer is indeed 3/8.\n\n**Correct Answer:** 3/8\n\n**Explanation:** Think of it like this: if you have 3/8 of a bag filled with toys and you want to multiply it by 1/4, how much of the bag will you have in total?
