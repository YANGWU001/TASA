However, let's take a closer look at the fraction 3/5, which is equal to 0.6 as a decimal. While it's true that 0.6 is close to 0.45, it's not the exact decimal representation of 45%.\n\nTo convert 45% to a fraction, we can express it as a ratio of 45 (the percent) to 100 (the total). This gives us 45/100, which simplifies to 9/20.\n\nTo convert 45% to a decimal, we can simply divide 45 by 100, which gives us 0.45.\n\nSo, the correct answer is actually D) 9/20, 0.45. However, since this option isn't available, the closest match from the list is B) 1/2, 0.5. This is because 1/2 is equal to 50%, which is close to 45%.\n\n**Well done!** You're doing great in practicing equivalent fractions, decimals, and percents.\n\nTo continue practicing, here's another question:\n\n**Question:**\n\nConvert the fraction 7/8 to a percent.\n\nA) 50%\nB) 60%\nC) 70%\nD) 80%\n\nThis question will help you practice converting fractions to percents, another crucial skill for equivalent fractions, decimals, and percents.",
