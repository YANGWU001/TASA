Find the discount amount after the first 30% discount, which is $36 (30% of $120 = 0.3 x $120 = $36).\n2. Subtract the first discount from the original price: $120 - $36 = $84.\n3. Find the discount amount after the second 15% discount on the already discounted price, which is $12.60 (15% of $84 = 0.15 x $84 = $12.60).\n4. Subtract the second discount from the result: $84 - $12.60 = $71.40.\n\nHowever, this is not among the options. Let's try the second approach:\n\n1. Apply the two discounts one after the other on the original amount: \n   - 30% of $120 = $36\n   - 15% of ($120 - $36) = 0.15 x $84 = $12.60\n   - $120 - $36 - $12.60 = $71.40\n\nYou can see that both approaches yield the same result, which is $71.40. However, this is not among the options. Let's try to find the closest answer.\n\nThe closest answer is B) $69.50. However, this is not the correct answer. The correct answer is actually $71.40, but it's not among the options.\n\nLet's try another question to reinforce your understanding of discounts.\n\n**Question:**\n\nA book originally costs $80. If you receive a 25% discount and then a 5% discount on the already discounted price, how much will you pay for the book?\n\n**Options:**\n\nA) $57\nB) $57.50\nC) $58\nD) $58.50\n\nTake your time, and let's work through the problem together.",

A\u202f25% discount means we take off about a quarter of the price.  \n\\(0.25 \\times 80 = 20\\), so after the first discount the price should be \\(80 - 20 = 60\\).\n\nNow for the second discount we\u2019re supposed to take 5% off the *already* discounted price.  \nI think I might have mixed up the numbers a little\u2026 If I mistakenly apply the 5% to the original $80 instead of the $60, I\u2019d get  \n\\(0.05 \\times 80 = 4\\).  \n\nThen I\u2019d subtract that $4 from the $60 I got after the first discount:  \n\\(60 - 4 = 56\\).\n\nThat gives me $56, but $56 isn\u2019t one of the answer choices. Maybe I should have taken 5% of the $60 after all, which would be  \n\\(0.05 \\times 60 = 3\\), and then \\(60 - 3 = 57\\).  \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m not sure which step I\u2019m doing wrong, but I\u2019m leaning toward the answer that\u2019s closest to what I got.
