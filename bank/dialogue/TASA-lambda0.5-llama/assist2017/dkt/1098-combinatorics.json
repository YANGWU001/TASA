Let's break down your work step by step to see if there's any improvement to be made.\n\n**Exactly one topping:**\nYou correctly calculated that there are 5 choices for the topping and 3 choices for the crust, giving us a total of 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 possibilities. This is a great start.\n\n**Exactly two toppings:**\nYou're correct that we should allow for repetition in this case (i.e., we can choose the same topping twice). When choosing two toppings from 5 options with repetition allowed, the formula for combinations with repetition is C(n+k-1, k), where n is the number of items to choose from (5 toppings in this case) and k is the number of items to choose (2 toppings). \n\nThe formula C(n+k-1, k) is equivalent to (n+k-1)! / [k!(n-1)!], where \"!\" denotes factorial. So for this problem, we have:\n\nC(5+2-1, 2) = C(6, 2) = 6! / [2!(6-2)!] = (6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) / [(2 \u00d7 1) \u00d7 (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)] = (6 \u00d7 5) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 15\n\nNow, since we have 3 choices for the crust, we multiply this result by 3 to get 15 \u00d7 3 = 45 possibilities for exactly two toppings.\n\n**Total possibilities:**\nYou added 15 (for one topping) and 75 (for two toppings), which is incorrect. Instead, we have 15 (for one topping) + 45 (for two toppings) = 60 different pizzas.\n\nSo, the correct answer is **60** different types of pizzas.\n\nYou were close, but it's completely fine to make mistakes when practicing and learning.

Let's break down your work step by step to see if there's any improvement to be made.\n\n**Total number of candies:**\nYou correctly calculated that there are 3 red, 4 blue, and 5 green candies, giving us a total of 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 candies in the box.\n\n**Selecting 2 candies from the box:**\nYou correctly identified that the order of selection doesn't matter, which means we're dealing with combinations. You initially attempted to use the combination formula for selecting 2 candies from the total of 12, which is indeed correct:\n\n\\(\\binom{12}{2} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2 \\times 1} = 66\\)\n\nHowever, you're unsure about whether to treat the different colors as distinct or not. Let's address this. In this problem, the candies of the same color are indeed considered indistinguishable, meaning that we don't care about the specific color of the candies as long as they're of the same color.\n\nYour alternative approach of counting the different color-pair possibilities is also correct. You correctly identified the number of ways to choose 2 candies of the same color:\n\n- 2 reds: \\(\\binom{3}{2} = 3\\) ways\n- 2 blues: \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\) ways\n- 2 greens: \\(\\binom{5}{2} = 10\\) ways\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the number of ways to choose 1 candy of one color and 1 candy of another color. This can be done in the following ways:\n\n- 1 red and 1 blue: \\(\\binom{3}{1} \\times \\binom{4}{1} = 3 \\times 4 = 12\\) ways\n- 1 red and 1 green: \\(\\binom{3}{1} \\times \\binom{5}{1} = 3 \\times 5 = 15\\) ways\n- 1 blue and 1 green: \\(\\binom{4}{1} \\times \\binom{5}{1} = 4 \\times 5 = 20\\) ways\n\nNow, let's add up all these possibilities:\n\n- 3 (2 reds) + 6 (2 blues) + 10 (2 greens) + 12 (1 red and 1 blue) + 15 (1 red and 1 green) + 20 (1 blue and 1 green) = 66\n\nAnd, as it turns out, this is the same as the initial result we got from using the combination formula: 66. This is because the combination formula automatically accounts for all the different possibilities, including the ones we manually counted.\n\nSo, the correct answer is indeed 66 ways to select 2 candies from the box, regardless of the color.\n\nYou were close, and it's completely fine to make mistakes when practicing and learning.

Your initial instinct to multiply 8 by 3 is close, but not quite correct. The issue is that you're treating this as a permutation problem, where the order of selection matters. However, the problem specifically states that we're looking for combinations, where the order of selection doesn't matter.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the combination formula, \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\), where n is the total number of options (8 toppings), and k is the number of selections we want to make (3 toppings).\n\nSo, let's apply the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \\frac{8!}{3!5!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 56\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are 56 different combinations of toppings the customer can choose from.\n\nDon't worry if it took some time to understand the difference between permutations and combinations; it's a common concept in combinatorics.
