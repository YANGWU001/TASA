Here's an appropriate first practice question to rebuild understanding:\n\n**Question:** What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 5 cm and a width of 3 cm?\n\n**Explanation:** \nTo calculate the perimeter of a rectangle, we need to add the lengths of all its sides. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width). \n\nLet's break it down: \n- Length (L) = 5 cm\n- Width (W) = 3 cm\n\nPerimeter = 2(L + W) = 2(5 + 3) = 2(8) = 16 cm\n\n**Answer:** The perimeter of the rectangle is 16 cm.\n\nThis question focuses on a basic concept and requires the student to apply a simple formula, making it a good starting point for review and rebuilding understanding.",

To reinforce the student's understanding of perimeter, let's try another question.\n\n**Question:** What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 10 cm and a width of 5 cm?\n\n**Hint:** Remember, the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is Perimeter = 2(Length + Width), and we have the length and width values.\n\nWhat do you think the perimeter of this rectangle is?",
