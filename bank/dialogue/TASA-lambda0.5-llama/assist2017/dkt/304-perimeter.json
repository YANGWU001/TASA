It's a straightforward, basic problem that reinforces the student's understanding of perimeter as the sum of all sides.\n2.  The dimensions are relatively easy to work with, reducing the likelihood of errors due to complex calculations.\n3.  The question allows the student to apply their existing knowledge of perimeter while introducing a new scenario, which will help solidify their understanding.\n\n**Learning objective:**\n\n*   Calculate the perimeter of a rectangle using the formula: perimeter = 2(length + width)\n*   Apply this formula to a simple geometric shape (rectangle) with given dimensions\n\n**What to look for:**\n\n*   Does the student correctly apply the formula?\n*   Can they accurately calculate the perimeter using the given dimensions?\n*   Are they able to identify the formula as perimeter = 2(length + width)?\n\nBy starting with this question, the student will have the opportunity to build upon their existing knowledge and gradually develop a stronger understanding of perimeter.",

Then, you multiplied 18 by 2 to get 36 cm, but this is not the correct answer.\n\nLet's try to think about it in a different way. Imagine you have a rectangle with a length of 12 cm and a width of 6 cm. If you were to count the total length around the rectangle, you would count the sides as follows: 12 cm + 6 cm + 12 cm + 6 cm = 36 cm. However, you counted each side twice, so you need to divide by 2 to get the correct perimeter.

The correct way to think about it is that you add the length and the width together (12 + 6 = 18), then multiply that by 2, but the other sides were not counted in the sum, so it should be 12 + 12 + 6 + 6 = 36.
