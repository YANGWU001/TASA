Here's a suitable first practice question:\n\n**Question:** \n\nEmily has 15% of a cake that is chocolate. If the total amount of cake is 120 slices, how many slices of chocolate cake does Emily have?\n\n**A)** 10 slices\n**B)** 20 slices\n**C)** 12 slices\n**D)** 18 slices\n\n**Explanation:** This question is a simple, concrete representation of percents, making it easier for the student to understand and calculate the answer. It also requires the student to apply their knowledge of percents to a real-world scenario, which can help them see the relevance and importance of the concept.\n\n**Answer:** To solve this problem, the student can multiply the total number of slices (120) by the percentage of chocolate cake Emily has (15%). This can be represented as 120 x 0.15 = 18 slices.\n\n**Learning Objective:** This question targets the student's ability to convert percents to decimal form and apply it to a real-world problem. By answering this question correctly, the student will demonstrate their understanding of percents and be able to build upon their existing knowledge.",

    "content": "Let's break down the steps to solve the problem and clarify any confusion.\n\nTo find the number of whole wheat loaves sold per day, you correctly converted 15% to a decimal by dividing by 100: 15 \u00f7 100 = 0.15. This is correct.\n\nHowever, when multiplying the total number of loaves sold per day (240) by the decimal (0.15), you mentioned you might have used 0.10 or 0.125 instead of 0.15. Let's clarify this step.\n\nThe correct decimal for 15% is indeed 0.15. Multiplying 240 by 0.15 is a simple calculation: 240 \u00d7 0.15 = 36. This is the correct answer, which is option **C) 36 loaves**.\n\nUsing 0.10 would give you 24 loaves (240 \u00d7 0.10 = 24), and using 0.125 would give you 30 loaves (240 \u00d7 0.125 = 30). However, the correct answer is 36 loaves, not 30.\n\nTo summarize, when working with percents, make sure to convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100, and then multiply the total by the decimal to find the desired quantity.\n\nLet's try another question to help you solidify your understanding of percents.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\n**Question:**\n\nA student scored 85% on a test with 90 questions.
