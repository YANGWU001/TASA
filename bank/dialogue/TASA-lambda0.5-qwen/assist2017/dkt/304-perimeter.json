What is the perimeter of the garden?**\n\n*Hint: Perimeter is the total distance around the shape. For a rectangle, you add up all the sides.*\n\n---\n\n### Why this works:\n- Uses a **real-world context** (garden) to make it relatable.\n- Involves only one concept: perimeter of a rectangle.\n- The student has already retained the concept (low forgetting), so this is a gentle step to **apply** it.\n- If they get it right, confidence grows. If they get it wrong, we can gently guide them to see where they may have missed the pattern (e.g., adding all four sides or miscounting).\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 *Next step suggestion (after this question):*  \n> After answering, ask: *\"How did you find the perimeter? Did you add all the sides?\"* This helps reinforce the process and identifies any gaps in application.\n\nLet me know when they respond \u2014 I\u2019ll be ready to guide further! \ud83d\ude0a",
