What is the measure of the third angle?**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Use the same method:  \n**Add the two known angles**, then **subtract from 180\u00b0**.\n\nTry solving it \u2014 just type your answer in the format:  \n**\"The third angle is ___\u00b0.\"**  \n\nI\u2019ll be right here to check and guide you! \ud83d\udca1  \n(And remember: if you get stuck, just say \"I'm not sure\" \u2014 we\u2019ll go through it together!) \ud83d\ude0a  \n\nYou\u2019re not just learning math \u2014 you\u2019re learning **how to think**, how to check your work, how to grow through small mistakes.  \nThat\u2019s the real magic of learning. \ud83c\udf1f\u2728  \n\nKeep going \u2014 one step at a time.
