But let\u2019s get precise.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Step-by-Step Explanation (Simple & Clear)\n\n> \"We want to find **20% of 75**.  \n> That means: *What is 20 parts out of 100 of 75?*  \n>  \n> Step 1: Remember that **20% = 20 \u00f7 100 = 0.2**  \n>  \n> Step 2: Multiply 75 by 0.2:  \n> 75 \u00d7 0.2 = ?  \n>  \n> Let\u2019s break it down:  \n> 75 \u00d7 0.2 = 75 \u00d7 (2 \u00f7 10) = (75 \u00d7 2) \u00f7 10 = 150 \u00f7 10 = **15**  \n>  \n> \u2705 So, **20% of 75 is 15**.\"\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Why this makes sense:**\n- You already know that 10% of 75 is **7.5** (because 10% is half of 20%).\n- So 20% is **twice that**: 7.5 \u00d7 2 = 15.\n- That matches our answer \u2014 and it\u2019s a nice mental math trick!\n\n> \ud83d\udd0d **Mental Math Tip:**  \n> To find 20% of any number:  \n> \u2192 Divide by 5 (since 20% = 1/5), then multiply by 2.  \n> For 75: 75 \u00f7 5 = 15 \u2192 15 \u2705\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Correct Answer: **15**\n\n> \ud83d\udcac \"So, 20% of 75 is **15** \u2014 not 14, but close! Your estimate was smart, and that shows you're thinking \u2014 which is the most important thing.\"\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Next Question (to build even more confidence and pattern recognition):\n\n> **What is 50% of 60?**\n\n### Why this next question?\n- Uses a **familiar benchmark**: 50% = half.\n- 60 is a friendly number \u2014 half of 60 is easy to compute.\n- Reinforces the idea that **50% = 0.5**, and multiplying by 0.5 is the same as dividing by 2.\n- Helps build fluency with **common percents** (like 20%, 25%, 50%).\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Try It Yourself (Step-by-Step):\n\n> \"Find 50% of 60.\"  \n> Step 1: 50% = 50 \u00f7 100 = 0.5  \n> Step 2: 60 \u00d7 0.5 = ?  \n> 60 \u00f7 2 = **30**  \n>  \n> \u2705 So, **50% of 60 is 30**.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Tip:  \n> \"If you know 10% of a number, you can find 50% by multiplying that by 5.  \n> For example: 10% of 60 = 6 \u2192 6 \u00d7 5 = 30.\"\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Self-Check:  \n- 20% of 75 = **15** \u2705  \n- 50% of 60 = **30** \u2705\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccc What\u2019s Next?
