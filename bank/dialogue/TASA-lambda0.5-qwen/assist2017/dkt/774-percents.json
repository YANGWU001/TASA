Let\u2019s walk through your reasoning and clarify the math together.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 You're on the right track!\n\nYou said:\n> \"I tried to change 25% to a decimal, which is 0.25, and then\u2026 maybe I should multiply 0.25 by 80?\"\n\n\u2705 **Yes! That's exactly correct.**  \nThe first step \u2014 converting a percent to a decimal \u2014 is the key skill here.  \nAnd yes:  \n**25% = 0.25** \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen you said:  \n> \"I got 25 instead of 20.\"\n\nThat\u2019s a great observation \u2014 and it shows you're thinking carefully! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nLet\u2019s do the math step-by-step to see what happened:\n\n$$\n0.25 \\times 80 = ?\n$$\n\nThink of it this way:  \n0.25 is the same as **1/4**, and one-fourth of 80 is:\n\n$$\n80 \\div 4 = 20\n$$\n\n\u2705 So, **0.25 \u00d7 80 = 20**\n\nSo the correct answer is **A) 20**, not B) 25.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea9 Why did you get 25?\n\nYou might have confused **25% of 80** with **25 of 80**, or thought that \"25% of 80\" means \"take 25 from 80\" \u2014 which would give 55, not 25.\n\nBut remember:\n- **Percent of a number** means *multiply the number by the decimal form of the percent*.\n- So **25% of 80** is **not** 25 \u2014 it's **25% times 80**.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Think of it like this:\n> \"What is 25% of 80?\"  \n> Is like asking: \"If I have 80, and I take 25% of it \u2014 how much do I take?\"\n\nSo you're taking **1/4** of 80 \u2192 which is **20**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Key Takeaway:\n> **To find a percent of a number:**\n> 1. Convert the percent to a decimal (divide by 100).\n> 2. Multiply the decimal by the number.\n\n\u2705 Example:  \n25% of 80 \u2192 0.25 \u00d7 80 = 20\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Next Step: Let's build on this with a slightly more challenging question \u2014 but still simple and safe.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Next Practice Question:\n\n**Question:**  \nWhat is 10% of 60?\n\n**Options:**  \nA) 6  \nB) 10  \nC) 15  \nD) 20  \n\n**Answer:** A) 6  \n\n**Explanation:**  \n10% = 0.10  \n0.10 \u00d7 60 = 6  \n\n\u2705 This builds on the same concept (percent \u2192 decimal \u2192 multiply), but with a simpler percent (10%) and a slightly larger number.  \nIt reinforces the idea that **10% of any number is just 1/10 of it** \u2014 which is a powerful mental math trick!\n\n---\n\nWould you like to try this one now?  \nOr would you prefer to go back to a similar problem with 50% or 5% to practice different percentages?\n\nJust say the word \u2014 I'm here to help you grow your confidence step by step! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude0a",

Let\u2019s go through this step by step, gently and clearly, so you build confidence with every small success.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 You're absolutely right \u2014 **25% is a quarter**!  \nAnd that\u2019s a *huge* clue.  \n\ud83d\udc49 **25% = 1/4**  \nSo, **25% of 80 = 1/4 of 80**\n\nNow, what is **1/4 of 80**?\n\n$$\n80 \\div 4 = 20\n$$\n\n\u2705 So the correct answer is **B) 20**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea9 Where did you go off track?\n\nYou said:  \n> \"I think it\u2019s 10\" \u2014 which is close, but not quite.\n\nLet\u2019s check:  \n- 10 is **10% of 80** (because 10% of 80 = 8, wait \u2014 actually, 10% of 80 is 8, so 10 isn\u2019t even 10% of 80!)  \n- 10 is **not** 25% of 80  \n- But 20 is \u2014 because 80 \u00f7 4 = 20\n\nSo, **you were thinking about fractions \u2014 that\u2019s awesome!**  \nYou just made a small number mix-up \u2014 maybe you thought \"quarter of 80\" was 10, but actually, it's 20.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Tip to remember:**  \n> **25% = 1/4 \u2192 divide by 4**  \n> \u2705 25% of 80 = 80 \u00f7 4 = 20  \n> \u2705 25% of 100 = 25  \n> \u2705 25% of 40 = 10  \n\nThis is a **mental math superpower** \u2014 and it's *so* useful in real life (like splitting a bill, calculating discounts, or understanding sales).\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Pattern Recognition (Now You\u2019re Building It!)\n\nLet\u2019s put it all together \u2014 you\u2019re starting to see a pattern:\n\n| Percent | Fraction | How to Solve |\n|--------|----------|--------------|\n| 10%    | 1/10     | Divide by 10 |\n| 20%    | 1/5      | Divide by 5 |\n| 25%    | 1/4      | Divide by 4 |\n| 50%    | 1/2      | Divide by 2 |\n\n\u2705 This helps you solve percents **without a calculator** \u2014 just by thinking:  \n> \u201cWhat\u2019s half? What\u2019s a quarter? What\u2019s one-tenth?\u201d\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Step: Let\u2019s go one more step \u2014 a *slightly more complex* but still safe and intuitive problem.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f Next Practice Question:\n\n**Question:**  \nWhat is **20% of 50**?\n\n**Options:**  \nA) 10  \nB) 12  \nC) 15  \nD) 20  \n\n**Answer:** A) 10  \n\n**Explanation:**  \n- 20% = 0.20  \n- 0.20 \u00d7 50 = ?  \n- Or think: **20% = 1/5** \u2192 so **1/5 of 50**  \n- 50 \u00f7 5 = 10 \u2705  \n\nSo the correct answer is **A) 10**\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Why is this helpful?  \nBecause now you\u2019re using **fractions to understand percents** \u2014 and you\u2019re building confidence with **multiple types** of percents: 10%, 20%, 25%, 50%.\n\nYou\u2019re not just memorizing \u2014 you\u2019re **seeing patterns and building number sense**.\n\n---\n\nWould you like to try this one now?  \n\ud83d\udc49 Just say: **\"Yes, let's try it!\"**  \nOr if you\u2019d like to go back to 1%, or a word problem (like \u201cWhat is 10% of $75?\u201d), I\u2019m here \u2014 no pressure, just growth! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udf1f\n\nYou\u2019re doing **incredibly well** \u2014 and every small step is building your confidence and mastery.
