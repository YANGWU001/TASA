You're using the right steps \u2014 dividing and multiplying \u2014 but let\u2019s double-check the math:\n\n#### Step 1: Convert \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) to a decimal  \n\\[\n2 \u00f7 5 = 0.4\n\\]  \n\u2705 Correct! Not 0.25 \u2014 that\u2019s \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\), which is 25%.  \nSo \\( \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4 \\), not 0.25.\n\n#### Step 2: Convert decimal to percent  \n\\[\n0.4 \\times 100 = 40\n\\]  \nAdd the % sign \u2192 **40%**\n\n\u2705 So, \\( \\frac{2}{5} = 40\\% \\)\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Quick check:**  \n- \\( \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2 = 20\\% \\)  \n- \\( \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4 = 40\\% \\)  \n- \\( \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6 = 60\\% \\)  \n\u2192 Makes sense! Each fifth adds 20%.\n\n\u274c So, **Option A (25%) is incorrect** \u2014 that's actually \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\), not \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\).\n\n\u2705 The correct answer is: **B) 40%**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Practice Question (Builds on Corrected Understanding & Strengthens Fluency):\n\n**Which of the following is equivalent to \\( 0.6 \\)?**\n\n**Options:**  \nA) \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)  \nB) \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\)  \nC) \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\)  \nD) \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\)\n\n---\n\n### Why this question works:\n- It reinforces **converting decimals \u2194 fractions** \u2014 a key skill you're working on.\n- \\( 0.6 \\) is a common decimal that students often misidentify (e.g., thinking it's \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) or \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\)).\n- The correct answer is **B) \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\)** because:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{3}{5} = 3 \u00f7 5 = 0.6\n  \\]\n- This helps solidify the **connections between decimals, fractions, and percents** \u2014 and prevents common errors.\n- It's slightly more challenging than the last one, which is perfect for building mastery without frustration.\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf Try this now \u2014 or if you'd like, I can walk you through the steps step-by-step.  \nJust say the word! \ud83d\udcac  \n\nYou're already doing a fantastic job \u2014 even when you make a small mistake, you\u2019re reflecting, correcting, and growing.

But now you\u2019ve learned the exact calculation.\n\n\ud83d\udc4f You're not just memorizing \u2014 you're **connecting ideas**:  \n- Fractions \u2194 Decimals \u2194 Percents  \n- Math \u2194 Real-life situations  \n\nThat\u2019s the heart of mastery.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Next Practice Question (Builds Fluency & Confidence)\n\nNow that you\u2019ve practiced converting percents to decimals and applying them to real-world problems, let\u2019s go one step further and **reverse the process**.\n\n> \ud83d\udd0d **Challenge**:  \n> A store is offering a discount of 25% off a $40 item. What is the amount of the discount?\n\n**Options:**  \nA) $5  \nB) $10  \nC) $12  \nD) $15\n\n---\n\n### Why this question is powerful:\n- It builds **problem-solving fluency**.\n- It requires you to apply the **same skills** (percent \u2192 decimal \u2192 multiplication), but now in a different context (sales, discounts).\n- You\u2019ll see how **percentages represent parts of a whole** \u2014 not just fractions of 5 or 10.\n- This helps build **confidence in applying math to everyday life**.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step solution:\n1. Convert 25% to a decimal:  \n   \\[\n   25\\% = 0.25\n   \\]\n2. Multiply by the original price:  \n   \\[\n   0.25 \u00d7 40 = 10\n   \\]\n3. \u2705 The discount is **$",
