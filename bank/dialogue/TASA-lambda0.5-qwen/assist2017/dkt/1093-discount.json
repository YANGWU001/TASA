    "content": "Absolutely! Given the student\u2019s current understanding\u2014limited mastery (~20%), moderate forgetting (score 0.22), and modest retention\u2014we should start with a **clear, foundational, and low-stakes** question that reinforces the core idea of *discount* without overwhelming them.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd First Practice Question:\n\n**A shirt originally costs $40. It is on sale for 25% off. What is the sale price of the shirt?**\n\n---\n\n### Why this question works:\n- **Simple and concrete**: Uses a real-world context (a shirt) students can relate to.\n- **Focuses on basic discount calculation**: Reinforces the concept that a discount reduces the original price.\n- **Avoids complexity**: No multi-step problems, fractions, or percentages beyond 25% (a common benchmark).\n- **Builds confidence**: A correct answer gives immediate positive feedback and helps stabilize retention.\n- **Aligns with low mastery**: Matches the student\u2019s current level\u2014just enough to build on, not too hard.\n\n\u2705 After answering, you can follow up with a quick check:  \n*\u201cDid you subtract 25% of $40 from the original price? What was the discounted amount?\u201d*  \nThis scaffolds the thinking process and supports deeper understanding.\n\nLet me know when they\u2019ve tried it\u2014then we can move to more challenging or applied questions! \ud83d\ude0a",
