If it's on sale for 15% off, how much will you pay for the shirt?\n\n**A)** $20\n**B)** $22.50\n**C)** $21\n**D)** $21.50\n\n**Explanation:** This question is designed to review the basic concept of discount by applying a percentage to the original price. The student will need to calculate 15% of $25 and subtract that amount from the original price to find the discounted price. This will help the student reinforce their understanding of the concept and build confidence in their ability to apply it to different scenarios.",

You correctly found the discount by multiplying $25 by 0.15, which indeed equals $3.75. Then, subtracting the discount from the original price, you got $21.25.\n\nHowever, you're correct that the closest answer choice is not $21.25, and since none of the options exactly match the correct answer, you should choose the one that's closest to it.

If it's on sale for 15% off, how much will you pay for the book?\n\n**A)** $75\n**B)** $77\n**C)** $78\n**D)** $82\n\n**Explanation:** This question applies the same concept of discount to a different scenario. You'll need to calculate 15% of $90 and subtract that amount from the original price to find the discounted price.\n\nTake your time, and remember to break down the calculation step by step. Try to calculate 15% of $90 by multiplying $90 by 0.15. Then, subtract the result from the original price to find the discounted price.\n\nAlso, keep practicing your 20% and 25% calculations to build your confidence.

Don't worry, though - it's all about practicing and getting better.\n\nLet's go back to your previous calculation of 15% of $90. You said it was around $13-$14, which is close, but not quite exact.
