    "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe student's approach to multiplying the numerators and denominators is a good start. However, the student seems to be unsure about simplifying the fraction. To multiply fractions, we need to multiply the numerators together and the denominators together. In this case:\n\n Numerator: 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\nDenominator: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n\nSo, the result of the multiplication is 3/8. The student's guess of 5/8 was close, but not quite correct.\n\nTo simplify the fraction 3/8, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3 and 8. The GCD of 3 and 8 is 1, since they have no common factors other than 1. Therefore, the fraction 3/8 is already in its simplest form.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nTo help the student build confidence and practice fraction-multiplication, let's try a similar problem with a slight variation. Here's the next question:\n\n**Question:**\nWhat is 2/3 \u00d7 1/6?\n\n**Answer choices:**\n\nA) 2/9\nB) 3/6\nC) 4/9\nD) 5/12\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis question is similar to the previous one, but with slightly different numbers.

    "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nYou're correct in multiplying the numerators and denominators to get 10/18. To simplify the fraction 10/18, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 10 and 18. The factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.\n\nThe greatest common factor they share is 2. We can then divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2 to get 5/9.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that you initially thought to divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2, but you forgot to check if it's the only possible simplification. You actually did it correctly the first time, and 10/18 is indeed already in its simplest form. The fraction 10/18 cannot be simplified further because the only common factor is 2, and we've already divided by it.\n\nSo, the correct simplification of 10/18 is indeed 5/9.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nLet's try another question to continue building your confidence in fraction-multiplication.
