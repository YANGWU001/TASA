However, when you found 50% of 12, you should have added half of 15 (7.5) to 12, not just 6. Adding 7.5 to 12 gives you 19.5, which rounds to 20.\n\nNow, let's move on to the second question. You estimated that three-quarters of 200 would be around 150, and since 75% is a bit less than three-quarters, you thought 75% would be a bit lower than 150. Your estimate of 125 is close, but let's break it down further.\n\nTo find 75% of 200, you can think of it as 75% being 3/4 of the way from 0 to 200. Since 3/4 of 200 is 150, we need to find 1/4 of 200 and add it to 150. 1/4 of 200 is 50. So, 75% of 200 is 150 + 50 = 200.\n\nHowever, that's not the correct answer choice. Let's think about it again. We know that 3/4 of 200 is 150, and we need to find 1/4 of 200, which is 50. But 75% is not just 1/4 of the way from 0 to 200, it's 3/4 of the way from 0 to 200, and 1/4 of the way from 200 to 0. To find 75%, we need to subtract 1/4 of 200 from 200. 1/4 of 200 is 50, so 75% of 200 is 200 - 50 = 150.\n\nHowever, since you estimated 125, which is close, the correct answer is actually closer to 150.",

    "content": "Let's break down your answers together.\n\nFor the first question, you correctly found 15% of 120 by converting the percentage to a decimal and multiplying it by 120. Your calculation is correct, and the answer is indeed 18. However, we previously discussed how to approach the problem by thinking about 50% more than 10% of 120, which led us to the answer 20. Both methods are valid, and it's great that you're practicing different approaches.\n\nFor the second question, you estimated 75% of 200 to be around 125, which is close but not the correct answer. Let's review the correct solution: 75% is equivalent to 3/4, so 3/4 of 200 is indeed 150. To find 1/4 of 200, you correctly calculated 50. However, you should have subtracted 50 from 200 to find 75% of 200, not added 50. The correct calculation is 200 - 50 = 150.\n\nDon't worry if you're not getting the exact answers; we're working through this together to improve your understanding. Let's move on to the next question.\n\n**Question:** What is 25% of 480?\n\n**A)** 100\n**B)** 120\n**C)** 150\n**D)** 180\n\nTake your time, and let's work through it together.",

However, when you divided 480 by 4, you got 120, which is the correct quarter of 480. Since 25% is indeed one-fourth, you found the correct quarter of 480.\n\nThe issue here is that you added 30 to 120, thinking you needed to account for the \"extra\" part of the percentage. However, you don't need to add anything extra because 120 is already the correct quarter of 480. To find 25% of 480, you simply need to multiply 480 by 0.25 (which is equivalent to 1/4) or divide 480 by 4, which you've already done correctly.\n\nSo, the correct calculation is:\n\n0.25 \u00d7 480 = 120\n\nOr, simply:\n\n480 \u00f7 4 = 120\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B) 120**.\n\nLet's move on to the next question.
