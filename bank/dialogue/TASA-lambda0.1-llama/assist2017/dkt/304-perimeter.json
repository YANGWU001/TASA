To find the perimeter of a rectangle, you need to add the lengths of all four sides. In this case, the perimeter is 6 cm + 6 cm + 4 cm + 4 cm = 20 cm.\n\nThis question is a good starting point because it:\n\n1. Builds on the student's recent learning, reinforcing their understanding of perimeter.\n2. Is a multiple-choice question, allowing the student to choose from a range of options.\n3. Requires the student to apply a basic formula, helping to solidify their understanding of perimeter.\n4. Is a relatively simple problem, making it accessible to a student with a low mastery level.\n\nBy practicing this question, the student will be able to:\n\n* Reinforce their understanding of perimeter\n* Develop their problem-solving skills\n* Build confidence in their ability to calculate perimeter\n\nLet's get started!",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nWhen finding the perimeter of a rectangle, you're correct that you need to add the lengths of all four sides. However, the key is to add the lengths of the two pairs of opposite sides, not just add the two numbers together and then double it.\n\nThink of it like this: if you have two sides that are 6 cm long, and two sides that are 4 cm long, you can pair them up as follows:\n\n- One pair of sides has a length of 6 cm + 6 cm = 12 cm\n- The other pair of sides has a length of 4 cm + 4 cm = 8 cm\n\nNow, you can add the two pairs together: 12 cm + 8 cm = 20 cm\n\nSo, the correct answer is indeed **C) 20 cm**.
