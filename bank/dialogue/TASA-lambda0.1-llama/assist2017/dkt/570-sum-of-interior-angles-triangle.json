The correct answer is C) 180\u00b0.\n\nThe sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180\u00b0, regardless of the size of the angles. In this case, we have two angles that are given: 45\u00b0 and 60\u00b0. Let's add these angles together: 45\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 = 105\u00b0. Now, we need to find the value of the third angle, x\u00b0, such that the total sum is 180\u00b0. Since we know the sum of all three angles is 180\u00b0, we can set up an equation: 105\u00b0 + x\u00b0 = 180\u00b0.\n\nTo solve for x\u00b0, we need to isolate x\u00b0 on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 105\u00b0 from both sides of the equation: x\u00b0 = 180\u00b0 - 105\u00b0. Solving for x\u00b0, we get x\u00b0 = 75\u00b0.\n\nSo, the sum of the interior angles of the triangle is 45\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 + 75\u00b0 = 180\u00b0.

Let's break it down together again.\n\nThe sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180\u00b0, regardless of the size of the angles. We can use this rule to solve problems like the ones we've been practicing.\n\nIn the previous question, we had angles 45\u00b0 and 60\u00b0, and we found that the third angle, x\u00b0, was 75\u00b0. This confirms that the sum of the interior angles of the triangle is indeed 180\u00b0.\n\nFor the new question, let's try to apply the same rule. We have angles 30\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, and we need to find the value of x\u00b0 such that the total sum is 180\u00b0. We can set up an equation: 30\u00b0 + 90\u00b0 + x\u00b0 = 180\u00b0.\n\nTo solve for x\u00b0, we need to isolate x\u00b0 on one side of the equation.
