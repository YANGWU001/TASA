    "content": "Given the student's low mastery of percents and recent struggles, it's essential to create a question that is not too challenging but still engaging and relevant to their learning needs. Here's an appropriate first practice question:\n\n**Question:** \n\n\"Tom has 12 pencils in a box. If he gives 1/4 of the pencils to his friend, what fraction of the pencils does Tom have left?\"\n\n**Answer:** (This question is designed to assess the student's understanding of percents and fractions, which are related concepts. The answer will help the student see the connection between fractions and percents, making it easier to understand percents in the future.)\n\n**Solution:** \n\nTo solve this problem, the student needs to find 1/4 of 12 pencils, which is 3 pencils. Then, they need to subtract 3 from 12 to find the number of pencils Tom has left: 12 - 3 = 9. This is equivalent to 3/4 of the original amount. Since the student is learning about percents, the next step is to convert the fraction 3/4 to a percent. \n\nTo convert 3/4 to a percent, the student needs to divide 3 by 4 and multiply by 100: (3 \u00f7 4) \u00d7 100 = 75%. \n\n**Follow-up question:** \"What percent of the original amount of pencils does Tom have left?\"",

    "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nYou're on the right track again. To find 30% of 240 loaves, you multiply 0.30 by 240:\n\n0.30 \u00d7 240 = 0.30 \u00d7 200 + 0.30 \u00d7 40\n\n= 60 + 12\n\n= 72\n\nSo, 30% of the bread is 72 loaves.\n\nNext, you need to find 25% of 240 loaves. Again, multiply 0.25 by 240:\n\n0.25 \u00d7 240 = 0.25 \u00d7 200 + 0.25 \u00d7 40\n\n= 50 + 10\n\n= 60\n\nNow, to find the percent of bread that is either whole wheat or rye, you need to add the number of whole wheat and rye loaves together: 72 + 60 = 132 loaves.\n\nHowever, you're not asked for the number of loaves, but the percent of the total loaves. Since there are 240 loaves in total, and 132 of them are whole wheat or rye, you can find the percent by dividing the number of whole wheat and rye loaves by the total number of loaves and multiplying by 100:\n\n(132 / 240) \u00d7 100 = 55%\n\nSo, 55% of the bread sold is either whole wheat or rye.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nHere's a new question that will help you practice finding percents and building on what you've learned:\n\n\"A store has a sale on toys.

However, there's a small mistake in your thinking.\n\nWhen you add 40% and 25%, you're actually adding two percentages of the total toys, not the percentage of toys on sale. To find the percentage of toys that are on sale, you should multiply the two percentages together:\n\n40% of the total toys are on sale, and 25% of those are discounted by 15%. So, the correct calculation is:\n\n0.40 \u00d7 0.25 = 0.10\n\nThis means 10% of the total toys are discounted by 15%.\n\nNow, to find the percentage of toys that are discounted by 15%, you're on the right track by multiplying 15% by 10%:\n\n0.15 \u00d7 0.10 = 0.015\n\nTo convert this to a percentage, multiply by 100:\n\n0.015 \u00d7 100 = 1.5%\n\nSo, 1.5% of the toys are discounted by 15%.\n\nDon't worry, it's a small mistake, and you're getting closer with each question.
