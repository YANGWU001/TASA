Let\u2019s walk through how to find the smaller angle on a clock, and then you\u2019ll have a solid strategy for the next problem.\n\n---\n\n## How to Measure Angles on a Clock\n\n1. **Understand the positions of the hands**\n   - The **minute hand** moves 360\u00b0 in 60\u202fminutes \u2192 **6\u00b0 per minute**.\n   - The **hour hand** moves 360\u00b0 in 12\u202fhours \u2192 **30\u00b0 per hour** \u2192 **0.5\u00b0 per minute** (because it also moves a little as the minutes pass).\n\n2. **Find the angle of each hand from the 12\u2011o\u2019clock position**\n   - **Minute hand:**  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Angle}_\\text{minute}=6^\\circ \\times (\\text{minutes past the hour})\n     \\]\n   - **Hour hand:**  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Angle}_\\text{hour}=30^\\circ \\times (\\text{hour})+0.5^\\circ \\times (\\text{minutes past the hour})\n     \\]\n\n3. **Compute the difference**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference}=| \\text{Angle}_\\text{hour} - \\text{Angle}_\\text{minute} |\n   \\]\n\n4. **Pick the smaller angle**\n   - If the difference is",

That position is our reference line (0\u00b0).  \n- The **hour hand** points exactly at the 3. Each hour mark on a clock is spaced **30\u00b0** (because 360\u00b0 \u00f7 12\u202fhours = 30\u00b0 per hour).  \n- Therefore the hour hand is **3\u202f\u00d7\u202f30\u00b0 = 90\u00b0** away from the 12.  \n\nThe angle between the two hands is the difference between their positions:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Angle} = |90\u00b0 - 0\u00b0| = 90\u00b0\n\\]\n\nSince 90\u00b0 is already the smaller of the two possible angles (the other would be 360\u00b0\u202f\u2013\u202f90\u00b0\u202f=\u202f270\u00b0), the correct answer is **90\u00b0**, not 45\u00b0.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Clock Problem \u2013 Measuring Angles**\n\nA clock shows the time",
