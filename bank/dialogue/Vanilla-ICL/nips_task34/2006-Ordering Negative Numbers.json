Let\u2019s review the key ideas so you feel more confident about ordering negative numbers.\n\n---\n\n### Why Ordering Negatives Can Feel Back\u2011wards\n* On a **number line**, values increase as you move **right**.\n* Negative numbers are **to the left** of zero.  \n  The **more negative** a number is, the **farther left** it sits, and therefore the **smaller** it is.\n* In other words, a number with a **larger absolute value** (the distance from zero) is **less** when the numbers are negative.\n\n| Number | Absolute value | Position on the line |\n|--------|----------------|----------------------|\n| \u20132     | 2              | a little left of 0   |\n| \u20134     | 4              | farther left        |\n| \u20136     | 6              | even farther left   |\n| \u20139     | 9              | farthest left (smallest) |\n\nSo, from **least \u2192 greatest** (smallest \u2192 largest) we go **from the farthest\u2011left number to the right\u2011most number**:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-9,\\; -6,\\; -4,\\; -2}\n\\]\n\nFrom **greatest \u2192 least** we reverse the order:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-2,\\; -4,\\; -6,\\; -9}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Quick Checklist for Ordering Negatives\n1. **Look at the absolute values** (ignore the sign for a moment).  \n2. **Arrange the absolute values from smallest to largest**.  \n3. **Put the negative sign back**: the smallest absolute value becomes the **greatest** (closest to zero), and the largest absolute",
