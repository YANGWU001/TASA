The correct measure is **90\u00b0**, which is a **right angle**. A right angle looks like the corner of a square or the \u201cL\u201d shape you see when two perpendicular lines meet. When the hour hand points to 3 and the minute hand points to 12, the two hands are perpendicular, so the angle between them is 90\u00b0.\n\n**How to think about right angles**\n\n- A full circle is 360\u00b0.  \n- Half a circle (a straight line) is 180\u00b0.  \n- One\u2011quarter of a circle is 360\u00b0\u202f\u00f7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f90\u00b0, which is a right angle.  \n\nWhenever two lines meet and form a corner that looks like the corner of a piece of paper, you\u2019re looking at a right angle.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Question:**  \nLook at the picture of a clock below.
