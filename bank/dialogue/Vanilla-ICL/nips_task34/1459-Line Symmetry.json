The kite can be folded in half along the line that runs from the top vertex to the bottom vertex, and the two halves match perfectly\u2014no other line will do that.  \n\n- An **equilateral triangle** actually has **three** lines of symmetry (one through each vertex and the opposite side).  \n- A **rectangle** has **two** lines of symmetry (vertical and horizontal).  \n- A **scalene triangle** has **none**.  \n- A **circle** has infinitely many lines of symmetry.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Question:**  \nLook at the five shapes below.

Therefore **A has one line of symmetry \u2013 a vertical line that runs down the middle**.\n\n- **What was good about your reasoning?**  \n  - You looked carefully at the shape and tried to imagine folding it. That\u2019s exactly the strategy we want you to use.  \n  - You noticed that if a part of the figure (the cross\u2011bar) is not centered, the two halves won\u2019t line up. This observation is useful for deciding whether a shape *does* have symmetry.\n\n- **Why the answer is still wrong:**  \n  - In many printed or handwritten fonts the cross\u2011bar can be slightly off\u2011center, which can make the symmetry less obvious. In geometry problems we assume the *ideal* shape, where the cross\u2011bar is perfectly centered. When the shape is drawn that way, folding it left\u2011to\u2011right makes the two halves match perfectly, so a vertical line of symmetry exists.\n\n**Keep it up!** You\u2019re already using the right visual test\u2014just remember that for the purpose of symmetry questions we work with the \u201cperfect\u201d version of the shape.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Question:**  \nLook at the following capital letters.

Simply saying \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d doesn\u2019t give the information the problem is looking for.  \n\n- **Why?**\u202fWhen we work on line\u2011symmetry problems we need to *test* the shape by imagining a fold (or drawing a line) and seeing whether the two halves match exactly.  If you\u2019re unsure, it\u2019s a great opportunity to try the folding test yourself and then explain what you observe.\n\n**A Quick Reminder**\n\nA figure has a line of symmetry if you can draw a straight line through it so that, when you fold the figure along that line, the two sides line up perfectly.\n\n- For the capital letter **A** (in its most common printed form), there **is** a vertical line of symmetry. The left side mirrors the right side; the cross\u2011bar is centered, so the halves match when folded left\u2011to\u2011right.  \n- A horizontal line would *not* work, because the top of the A is a point while the bottom is a wide base.\n\n**What to Do When You\u2019re Stuck**\n\n1. **Draw the line** you think might be a symmetry line.  \n2. **Fold** a piece of paper with the letter printed on it, or trace the halves on a separate sheet and compare.  \n3. **Observe** whether every part on one side has an identical counterpart on the other side.\n\nNow let\u2019s try another example so you can practice this process.\n\n---\n\n### Practice Question\n\n**Look at the capital letter \u201cE\u201d.**  \n\n1.
