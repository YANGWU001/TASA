In mathematical terms, you need to find the **Highest Common Factor (HCF)** \u2013 also called the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) \u2013 of the two numbers 48 and 60.\n\n*How to solve it (quick reminder):*  \n\n1. List the factors of each number, or use the prime\u2011factor method.  \n   - 48\u202f=\u202f2\u00b3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3  \n   - 60\u202f=\u202f2\u00b2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5  \n2. Identify the common prime factors with the smallest exponent: 2\u00b2 and 3.  \n3. Multiply them: 2\u00b2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f4\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12.  \n\nSo the HCF of 48 and 60 is **12**. That means each team can have at most 12 students, giving 4 teams for Game\u202fA (48\u202f\u00f7\u202f12) and 5 teams for Game\u202fB (60\u202f\u00f7\u202f12).\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\nA school wants to form identical groups for two different clubs:\n\n- Club\u202fX has **84** members.  \n- Club\u202fY has **126** members.\n\nThe teacher wants each group to have the same number of members, using **all** the students in each club.\n\n**Question:** What is the greatest possible number of students that can be in each group? (Find the HCF of 84 and 126.)\n\n**Hint:**  \n- Write the prime factorisation of each number.  \n- Then take the common prime factors with the smallest powers.\n\nGive it a try, and let me know the number you obtain!",

In that particular case 14 would be the correct HCF.  \n\nHowever, in the problem you were working on the numbers were **different** (e.g., 48 and 60, or 84 and 126 \u2013 whichever the original question gave).
