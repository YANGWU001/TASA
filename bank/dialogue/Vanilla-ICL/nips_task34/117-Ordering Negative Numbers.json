The predicted low temperatures (in degrees Celsius) are:\n\n- Monday: **\u20113\u00b0**\n- Tuesday: **\u20118\u00b0**\n- Wednesday: **\u20111\u00b0**\n- Thursday: **\u20115\u00b0**\n\n**Task:**  \nArrange the four temperatures from **coldest (lowest) to warmest (highest)**. Write the numbers in order, separated by commas. \n\n*Example format:*\u202f\u201110\u00b0,\u202f\u20117\u00b0,\u202f\u20112\u00b0,\u202f0\u00b0  \n\nGive it a try! \ud83c\udfbf\u2744\ufe0f",

That\u2019s only two of the four temperatures, and the order isn\u2019t correct for the full set.\n\nWhen we order negative numbers we remember that **the more negative a number is, the smaller it is**.  \nSo on a number line:\n\n- \u201112  <  \u20118  <  \u20115  <  \u20112  \n\n(\u201112 is the *least* value, \u20112 is the *greatest* among the negatives.)\n\nBecause the original list had four numbers, we need to place **all four** in the correct sequence from the smallest (most negative) to the largest (least negative). Since you only gave two numbers, the answer is incomplete and the order is not correct.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question \u2013 Ordering Negative Numbers\n\n**Scenario:**  \nYou\u2019re helping a ski resort staff plan the nightly temperature reports for the next four evenings.
