That answer is **incorrect**.\n\n**Why?**\n\n- On a clock face the hour marks are spaced **30\u00b0** apart (360\u00b0 \u00f7 12\u202fhours = 30\u00b0 per hour).\n- The short hand is at **12** and the long hand is at **3**.  \n  From 12 to 3 there are **three hour marks** (12\u202f\u2192\u202f1, 1\u202f\u2192\u202f2, 2\u202f\u2192\u202f3).  \n- Multiply the number of marks by the spacing:  \n\n\\[\n3 \\text{ marks} \\times 30\u00b0\\text{ per mark}= 90\u00b0\n\\]\n\nSo the **smaller angle** between the hands is **90\u00b0** (the larger, reflex angle would be 360\u00b0\u202f\u2013\u202f90\u00b0\u202f=\u202f270\u00b0).\n\nYour \u201chalf of 30\u00b0\u201d reasoning was off because you only moved one\u2011half hour (15\u00b0) instead of three whole hours.
