The rule is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{(negative)} \\times \\text{(positive)} = \\text{negative}\n\\]\n\nSo\n\n\\[\n(-4) \\times 3 = -12 .\n\\]\n\nThe \u201c\u201112\u201d tells you that, over the two\u2011week period, the combined effect is a **12\u202f\u00b0C drop** (if you were interpreting the product as a net change).  \n\nIn the new problem you started to write, you\u2019ll need to:\n\n1. **Convert the percent changes to decimal factors** (e.g., a 5\u202f% decrease \u2192 multiply by 0.95; a 2\u202f% increase \u2192 multiply by 1.02).  \n2. **Apply the signs correctly** when the factor is less than 1 (a decrease) versus greater than 1 (an increase).  \n3. **Multiply the factors**; if one factor is a \u201cdecrease\u201d (a number <\u202f1) and the other is an \u201cincrease\u201d (a number >\u202f1), the product will be less than 1, meaning an overall decrease.\n\nYou\u2019re on the right track by thinking about \u201cdecimal factors.\u201d Let\u2019s finish the steps together in the next practice problem.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question\n\nA small business tracks the daily profit of a product.  \n\n- **Day\u202f1:** Profit drops **5\u202f%** compared to the previous day.  \n- **Day\u202f2:** Profit",
