That\u2019s okay\u202f\u2014\u202frecognizing that you need help is the first step toward learning! Let\u2019s walk through the problem together so you can see how BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division & Multiplication, Addition & Subtraction) works in practice.\n\n---\n\n### Solving the Example\n\nExpression:  \n\n\\[\n5 \\;+\\; 2 \\times 3 \\;-\\; \\bigl(8 \\div 4\\bigr)\n\\]\n\n1. **Brackets** \u2013\u202fDo anything inside parentheses first.  \n   \\[\n   8 \\div 4 = 2\n   \\]\n   The expression becomes  \n   \\[\n   5 \\;+\\; 2 \\times 3 \\;-\\; 2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Division & Multiplication** \u2013\u202fWork from left to right.  \n   \\[\n   2 \\times 3 = 6\n   \\]\n   Now we have  \n   \\[\n   5 \\;+\\; 6 \\;-\\; 2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Addition & Subtraction** \u2013\u202fAgain, go left to right.  \n   \\[\n   5 + 6 = 11 \\\\\n   11 - 2 = 9\n   \\]\n\n**Result:** Sam spends **\\$9**.\n\n---\n\n### Why This Matters\n- **Brackets** protect the operations inside them; they\u2019re always done first.  \n- **Multiplication and division** have the same priority, so you handle them in the order they appear.  \n- **Addition and subtraction** are last, also done left\u2011to\u2011right.\n\nPracticing each step separately helps you see the order clearly and reduces mistakes.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question\n\n**Problem**\n\nLena is buying supplies for a craft project. She spends:\n\n\\[\n12 \\;-\\; \\bigl(",
