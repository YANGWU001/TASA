Solving it will give you the set of admissible numbers of plants you can buy.\n\n**What you would do (step\u2011by\u2011step)**\n\n1. **Translate the word problem into an algebraic inequality.**  \n   - Each plant costs \\$3, so the total cost for \\(x\\) plants is \\(3x\\).  \n   - The budget restriction is \u201cless than \\$50,\u201d which becomes \\(3x < 50\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the variable.**  \n   - Divide both sides by 3 (the coefficient of\u202f\\(x\\)). Remember, dividing by a positive number does **not** flip the inequality sign:  \n     \\[\n     x < \\frac{50}{3} \\approx 16.67.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Interpret the result in the context of the problem.**  \n   - \\(x\\) must be a whole number of plants, so the largest integer satisfying the inequality is \\(x = 16\\).  \n   - Any integer **0\u202f\u2264\u202fx\u202f\u2264\u202f16** works (you can also include 0 if you allow buying no plants).\n\nNow you see the whole chain: words \u2192 inequality \u2192 solve \u2192 interpret.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Scenario:**  \nYou are buying ribbons for a craft project.
