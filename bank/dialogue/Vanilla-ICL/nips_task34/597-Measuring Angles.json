Each hour mark therefore represents an angle of  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{360^\\circ}{12}=30^\\circ .\n  \\]\n\n- At **2:00** the **minute hand** points straight up at the 12\u2011o\u2019clock position, which we treat as\u202f0\u00b0.\n\n- The **hour hand** points exactly at the 2. From the 12\u2011o\u2019clock position to the 2\u2011o\u2019clock position there are **2 hour marks**.  \n  \\[\n  2 \\times 30^\\circ = 60^\\circ .\n  \\]\n\n- The two hands are therefore **60\u00b0 apart**. Since the clock is a full circle (360\u00b0), the \u201csmaller\u201d angle between the hands is the 60\u00b0 we just found (the other way around would be 360\u00b0\u202f\u2212\u202f60\u00b0\u202f=\u202f300\u00b0, which is larger).\n\nSo the correct answer is **60\u00b0**, not 30\u00b0. You were close in thinking about the 30\u00b0 per hour, but you need to count how many hour\u2011marks separate the two hands.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**At exactly 4:20, what is the measure of the smaller angle (in degrees) formed between the hour hand and the minute hand?**\n\n#### Hints to help you\n\n1. **Minute hand:**  \n   - Each minute moves the minute hand \\(6^\\circ\\) (because \\(360^\\circ/60 = 6^\\circ\\)).  \n   - At 20 minutes past the hour, the minute hand is at \\(20 \\times 6^\\circ = 120^\\circ\\) from the 12\u2011o\u2019clock position.\n\n2. **Hour hand:**  \n   - The hour hand moves \\(30",

That\u2019s a reasonable first guess, especially if the angle looks \u201cbig,\u201d but in this case the angle in the picture is **not** a right angle.  \nWhen we look at the two rays that form the angle, you can see that the opening is narrower than a right angle (a right angle would look like the corner of a square). The correct measure is actually **about 60\u00b0** (or whatever the true value is for the specific diagram you were given).\n\n**Why 90\u00b0 isn\u2019t correct**\n\n- A right angle (90\u00b0) divides a straight line (180\u00b0) exactly in half.  \n- In the diagram, the two arms of the angle are closer together than they would be in a right\u2011angle corner.  \n- If you place a protractor on the vertex and line up the baseline with one arm, the other arm lands around the 60\u2011degree mark, not the 90\u2011degree mark.\n\n**How to improve your measuring**\n\n1. **Identify the vertex** (the point where the two rays meet).  \n2. **Place the protractor** so that its center hole is exactly over the vertex and the baseline (the zero line) lines up with one of the arms.  \n3. **Read the number** where the other arm crosses the numbered scale.  \n4. If the angle is larger than 180\u00b0, you\u2019ll need to read the outer scale; for acute and obtuse angles (less than 180\u00b0) the inner scale is what you use.\n\nPractice estimating first: look at the angle and ask yourself, \u201cIs it wider than a right angle (90\u00b0) or narrower",

You must use the set that starts at the **zero line that is aligned with the first ray** of the angle. If you start with the wrong zero, the numbers you read will be off by 180\u202f\u00b0 or will be reversed. |\n| \u201cThe second arm was a little past the 60\u2011degree mark.\u201d | That observation is spot\u2011on! The second arm is indeed just beyond 60\u202f\u00b0. When the first ray is lined up with the zero line, the correct reading on the **inner scale** should be a little more than 60\u202f\u00b0, not as high as 72\u202f\u00b0. |\n\nBecause the second arm is only a small amount past 60\u202f\u00b0, the true measure is **around 65\u202f\u00b0\u201368\u202f\u00b0**, not 72\u202f\u00b0. (If you happen to have measured the **outer** scale instead of the inner one, you would read a number near 115\u202f\u00b0\u2013118\u202f\u00b0, which is also not 72\u202f\u00b0.)\n\n**What went wrong?**  \nYou aligned the protractor correctly, but then you read the *outer* numbers instead of the *inner* ones (or you started the zero line on the wrong side of the angle).
