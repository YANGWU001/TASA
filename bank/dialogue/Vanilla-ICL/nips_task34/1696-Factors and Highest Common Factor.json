List the factors of each number (or use prime\u2011factorisation).  \n2. Identify the common factors.  \n3. Choose the largest one \u2013 that\u2019s the HCF.\n\nNow you have the process fresh in your mind, let\u2019s try another problem that uses the same idea but in a slightly different context.\n\n---\n\n### Practice Question\n\n**Mia is arranging chairs for two different classroom activities.**\n\n- For the first activity she has **84** chairs.  \n- For the second activity she has **126** chairs.\n\nShe wants to set up the chairs into **identical rows** for each activity, using **all** of the chairs each time, and she wants each row to have the **same number of chairs** for both activities.\n\n**What is the greatest possible number of chairs that can be in each row?**  \n\n*(In other words, find the highest common factor of 84 and 126.)*\n\n---\n\n**How to approach it**\n\n1. Write the prime factorisation of each number (or list the factors).  \n2. Identify the common prime factors and multiply them together.  \n3. The product you obtain is the HCF \u2013 the largest number of chairs per row that works for both activities.\n\nGive it a try, and let me know what you get or where you get stuck! \ud83c\udf1f",
