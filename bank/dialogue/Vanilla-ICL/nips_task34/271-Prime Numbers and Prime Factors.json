List the factors of 84: 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f7,\u202f12,\u202f14,\u202f21,\u202f28,\u202f42,\u202f84.  \n2. The *largest* factor that is **smaller than 84** is 42, but that would give only 2 piles (84 \u00f7 42 = 2).  \n3. The question wants the *largest number of coins per pile*, so we look for the **largest factor that is not larger than half of 84** (because a pile can\u2019t contain more than half the coins). The biggest factor \u2264\u202f42 is **12**.  \n4. 84 \u00f7 12 = **7**, so you can make **7 equal piles of 12 coins** (or 12 piles of 7 coins).  \n\nUnderstanding how to list factors and pick the appropriate one is the key skill here.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question\n\n**Problem**\n\nA baker has **126** cupcakes and wants to arrange them on identical trays so that each tray holds the same number of cupcakes and no cupcake is left over.  \n\n1.
