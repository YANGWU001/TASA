That\u2019s completely okay\u2014recognizing a gap is the first step toward filling it!  \n\nIn the previous problem you needed to find the **least common multiple (LCM)** of the two time intervals (the minutes between chip replacements). The LCM tells us the first moment when both games will need a new chip **at the same time**.  \n\nTo solve an LCM problem you can use either of these reliable strategies:\n\n| Strategy | How it works |\n|----------|--------------|\n| **List the multiples** | Write out the first few multiples of each number until you see a common one. The smallest common value is the LCM. |\n| **Prime\u2011factor method** | Break each number into its prime factors, then for each distinct prime take the highest power that appears. Multiply those together \u2013 the product is the LCM. |\n\nIf you try one of those methods on the numbers from the earlier question (e.g., 6\u202fmin and 8\u202fmin), you\u2019ll see the answer emerges quickly. Give it a try before looking at the next practice problem; you\u2019ll likely spot the pattern.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question \u2013 LCM\n\n**Scenario**\n\nYou are organizing a school lunch schedule.  \n\n- **Class\u202fX** receives a snack every **9 minutes**.  \n- **Class\u202fY** receives a snack every **12 minutes**.  \n\nBoth classes start receiving snacks at the same time (time\u202f=\u202f0).\n\n**Question:** After how many minutes will both classes receive a snack **together** for the first time?\n\n### How to approach\n\n1. **List multiples** (quick check)  \n   -",

Even if you\u2019re unsure how to get the answer, the goal is to work toward it by using the concepts of *multiples* and the *lowest common multiple (LCM)*.\n\n**Why the answer is needed**\n\n- Each game has its own \u201cchip\u2011replacement interval.\u201d  \n- The moment when **both** games need a new chip together is the first time the two intervals line up.  \n- Mathematically, that moment is the **least common multiple** of the two interval lengths.\n\nSo the next step is to list the multiples of each interval, find the smallest number that appears in both lists, and that number (in minutes) is the answer.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Problem**\n\nGame\u202fX needs a new token every **8 minutes**.  \nGame\u202fY needs a new token every **12 minutes**.\n\nBoth games start with a fresh token at time\u202f=\u202f0.\n\n**Question:** After how many minutes will both games need to replace their tokens at the same time for the first time?\n\n---\n\n### How to Approach It (Guided Steps)\n\n1. **Write a few multiples** of each interval.  \n   - Multiples of 8: 8,\u202f16,\u202f24,\u202f32,\u202f40,\u202f\u2026  \n   - Multiples of 12: 12,\u202f24,\u202f36,\u202f48,\u202f\u2026  \n\n2. **Identify the smallest common multiple** (the first number that appears in both lists).  \n\n3. **That number is the LCM**, which is the answer to the question.\n\n*If you get stuck, try the prime\u2011factor method for finding the LCM:*\n\n- Factor each interval into primes:  \n  - 8\u202f=\u202f2\u00b3  \n  - 12\u202f=\u202f2\u00b2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3  \n\n- For each prime, take the highest power that appears in any factorization:  \n  - ",
