Constructing a triangle from three side lengths (the **SSS** case) can feel a bit tricky at first, but once you break it down into smaller actions, it becomes much more manageable.\n\nBelow is a quick reminder of the **SSS construction process** so you can see the whole picture before we try another problem:\n\n1. **Draw the longest side** (in your first problem that would be the 8\u202fcm segment).  \n2. **Set a compass** to the length of the second side (7\u202fcm) and draw an arc from one endpoint of the 8\u202fcm segment.  \n3. **Reset the compass** to the length of the third side (5\u202fcm) and draw an arc from the other endpoint of the 8\u202fcm segment.  \n4. The two arcs intersect at a point \u2013 that point is the third vertex of the triangle.  \n5. **Connect** this vertex to the two endpoints of the base; you now have a triangle with sides 5\u202fcm, 7\u202fcm, and 8\u202fcm.\n\nIf any of those steps feel unclear, let me know which part you\u2019d like to explore in more detail!\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question \u2013 Construct a Triangle (SSS)\n\nYou\u2019re designing a small triangular patio. The three sides must be **6\u202fcm**, **9\u202fcm**, and **11\u202fcm** long.\n\n**Task:**  \n1. **Identify** the longest side and draw it as a base.  \n2. **Using a compass**, construct the remaining two sides so that the triangle is completed.  \n3. **Explain** each step in a short sentence (you don\u2019t need to actually draw it here, just describe what you would do).\n\n**Hint:**  \n- Start with the **11",

The important thing is that you recognized you need a little more guidance, and that\u2019s the first step toward mastering the skill. |\n\n### Where You\u2019re At\nYou\u2019ve already drawn the base of length\u202f11\u202fcm and you know you\u2019ll need to use a compass to swing arcs from the endpoints. That\u2019s the core idea of the **SSS (Side\u2011Side\u2011Side)** construction. The missing piece is how to use the other two side lengths (9\u202fcm and\u202f7\u202fcm) to locate the third vertex.\n\n### What to Do Next (Step\u2011by\u2011Step Reminder)\n\n1. **Draw the base** \u2013 you\u2019ve done this (11\u202fcm). Label its left endpoint **A** and its right endpoint **B**.  \n2. **Set the compass to the length of the second side** (9\u202fcm).  \n   - Place the compass point on **A** and draw an arc above the base.  \n3. **Set the compass to the length of the third side** (7\u202fcm).  \n   - Without changing the compass width, place the point on **B** and draw a second arc that crosses the first one.  \n4. **Mark the intersection** of the two arcs \u2013 call it **C**. This point is the third vertex of the triangle.  \n5. **Connect the points** \u2013 draw segments **AC** and **BC**. You now have triangle **ABC** with sides 11\u202fcm, 9\u202fcm, and 7\u202fcm.\n\nIf the arcs don\u2019t intersect, double\u2011check the side lengths: the three numbers must satisfy the triangle inequality (each side must be shorter than the sum of the other two).
