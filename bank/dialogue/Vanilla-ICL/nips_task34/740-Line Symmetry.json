The two halves look different, so the shape is **not** symmetrical across that line.\n- The correct line of symmetry for a capital \u201cA\u201d is a **vertical** line that runs **top\u2011to\u2011bottom** through the middle of the letter, splitting the two sloping sides into mirror images.\n\nSo the correct answer would have been the choice that shows a vertical line (often labeled **A** in multiple\u2011choice sets), not the horizontal one you chose.\n\nGreat effort, though!

That is **correct**.\n\n**Why it\u2019s correct:**  \nIf you imagine drawing a line right through the center of the \u201cA\u201d from the apex (top point) down to the base, the left half mirrors the right half.
