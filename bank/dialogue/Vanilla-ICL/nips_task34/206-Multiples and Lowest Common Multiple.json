Factor each number into primes.  \n   - \\(15 = 3 \\times 5\\)  \n   - \\(20 = 2^2 \\times 5\\)\n\n2. For each distinct prime, take the highest power that appears in either factorization.  \n   - Prime\u202f2: highest power is \\(2^2\\) (from 20)  \n   - Prime\u202f3: highest power is \\(3^1\\) (from 15)  \n   - Prime\u202f5: highest power is \\(5^1\\) (appears in both)\n\n3. Multiply those highest powers together:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{LCM} = 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 = 4 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 60\n   \\]\n\n**Method 2 \u2013 Listing multiples (quick check)**  \n\n- Multiples of 15: 15,\u202f30,\u202f45,\u202f**60**,\u202f75,\u2026  \n- Multiples of 20: 20,\u202f40,\u202f**60**,\u202f80,\u2026  \n\n",
