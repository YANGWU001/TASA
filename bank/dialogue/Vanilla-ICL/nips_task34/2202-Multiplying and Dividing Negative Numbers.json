If she takes **\u20116 steps** (meaning she moves forward instead of backward), how many meters does she change in elevation?\n\n**Interpretation of the negative step**\n\n- \u201c\u20116 steps\u201d tells us the direction is opposite of \u201cbackward\u201d; it\u2019s actually **forward**.\n- The rule for the trail is: **backward step \u2192\u202f\u20114\u202fm change** (a drop of 4\u202fm).\n- When we reverse the direction, the sign of the change also reverses.\n\n**Mathematical set\u2011up**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Elevation change}= (\\text{drop per backward step}) \\times (\\text{number of steps})\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Elevation change}= (-4\\ \\text{m/step}) \\times (-6\\ \\text{steps})\n\\]\n\n**Multiplying two negative numbers:**  \nA negative \u00d7 a negative = a **positive**.\n\n\\[\n(-4)\\times(-6)=+24\\ \\text{meters}\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** The hiker *gains* 24\u202fmeters in elevation (she moves upward because she walked forward on a trail that slopes downward).\n\n---\n\n### Why This Works\n- **Negative \u00d7 Negative = Positive** \u2013 Think of \u201cnegative\u201d as \u201copposite direction.\u201d Two opposites make a \u201csame direction\u201d effect, which is why the product is positive.\n- When you see a negative number of steps, treat it as moving in the opposite way from what the word \u201cbackward\u201d (or \u201cforward\u201d) describes.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question\n\n> **",

That\u2019s okay\u2014recognizing you\u2019re unsure is the first step.  \n\nLet\u2019s see how we would solve the problem:\n\n- The trail **drops 4\u202fm for every step backward** \u2192 each backward step is **\u20134\u202fm** (negative because it\u2019s a drop).  \n- The hiker takes **\u20116 steps**. A negative number of steps means she is actually moving **forward** instead of backward.  \n\nThe total change in elevation is the product of the two numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{change} = (-4\\ \\text{m/step}) \\times (-6\\ \\text{steps}) = (+24\\ \\text{m})\n\\]\n\nTwo negatives multiplied give a positive, so the hiker **rises 24\u202fm** (she goes up the mountain rather than down).\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\nA scuba diver descends 3\u202ffeet for each second she swims downward.
