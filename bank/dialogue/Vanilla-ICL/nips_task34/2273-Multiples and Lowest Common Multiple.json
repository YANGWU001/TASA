The question was asking for the **smallest number of cards that works for both games** \u2013 in other words, the **least common multiple (LCM)** of 6 and 8.\n\n**How to find the LCM of 6 and 8**\n\n1. List a few multiples of each number.  \n   - Multiples of 6: 6,\u202f12,\u202f18,\u202f24,\u202f30,\u202f\u2026  \n   - Multiples of 8: 8,\u202f16,\u202f24,\u202f32,\u202f40,\u202f\u2026\n\n2. Look for the smallest number that appears in **both** lists.  \n   - The first common multiple is **24**.\n\n3. Therefore, the smallest number of cards that works for both Game\u202fA (6 cards per round) and Game\u202fB (8 cards per round) is **24**.\n\nSo the correct answer is **24**. If you weren\u2019t sure, that\u2019s okay\u2014let\u2019s practice a similar problem together.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Scenario:**  \nYou are organizing snack stations for a school event.  \n\n- Station X hands out snack bags in packs of **9**.  \n- Station Y hands out snack bags in packs of **12**.\n\n**Question:**  \nWhat is the smallest number of snack bags you could have on hand so that you can fill **both** stations without leaving any bags leftover? (Find the least common multiple of 9 and 12.)\n\n**Hint:**  \nYou can either list a few multiples of each number or use prime\u2011factorization:\n\n- Prime factors of 9 = \\(3^2\\)  \n- Prime factors of 12 = \\(2^2 \\times 3\\)  \n\nTake the highest power of each prime that appears (here \\(2^2\\) and \\(3^2\\)) and multiply them.\n\nGive",

Therefore this response is counted as **incorrect**.\n\n**Why?**  \nThe problem is asking for the **least common multiple (LCM)** of the two numbers of cards per round (6 and 8). The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of **both** numbers. If we can find that number, we know the earliest round in which both games could finish together.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Review: How to Find the LCM\n\n1. **List the multiples** of each number (or use prime factorization).  \n   - Multiples of 6: 6,\u202f12,\u202f18,\u202f24,\u202f30,\u202f\u2026  \n   - Multiples of 8: 8,\u202f16,\u202f24,\u202f32,\u202f40,\u202f\u2026\n\n2. **Identify the smallest number that appears in both lists.**  \n   In the example above, the first common multiple is **24**. So the LCM of 6 and 8 is 24.\n\n3. **Alternative method \u2013 prime factorization:**  \n   - 6 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3  \n   - 8 = 2\u00b3  \n   - Take each prime the highest number of times it appears: 2\u00b3 (from 8) and 3\u00b9 (from 6).  \n   - LCM = 2\u00b3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 = 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 = **24**.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question\n\n**Problem**\n\nYou are organizing snack packs for a school event.  \n\n- Snack Pack X contains **9** cookies.  \n- Snack Pack Y contains **12** crackers.\n\nYou want to prepare a single tray that holds *exactly the same number* of items from each type, with no leftovers, and you want the tray to be as small as possible.\n\n**What is the smallest total number of items that can be placed on the tray so that",

The question asked for the **smallest number of cards that could be used in a round where both games finish at the same time**. To answer that, you need to find the **least common multiple (LCM)** of the two game\u2011length numbers.  \n\n*Why the LCM?*  \nWhen two games repeat in cycles (e.g., one game ends every\u202f4\u202fcards, the other every\u202f6\u202fcards), the first time they both finish together is after a number of cards that is a multiple of **both** cycle lengths. The smallest such number is the LCM.  \n\nSo, to solve the problem:\n\n1. List a few multiples of each game\u2019s length.  \n2. Identify the smallest number that appears in **both** lists.  \n3. That number is the LCM and is the answer the question is looking for.\n\n---\n\n### Next practice question\n\n**Problem:**  \nGame\u202fA uses a new deck of cards every **5** rounds.  \nGame\u202fB uses a new deck of cards every **8** rounds.  \n\nWhat is the **fewest number of rounds** after which both games will need to use a new deck at the same time?\n\n**Steps to solve (you can follow these):**  \n\n1.

Find the smallest number that appears in **both** lists.  \n\nThat smallest common multiple is the answer.\n\nGive it a try and tell me the number you get, or let me know if you\u2019d like a hint!",
