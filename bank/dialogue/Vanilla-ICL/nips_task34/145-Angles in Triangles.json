Let\u2019s check the work together.\n\n- The interior angles of any triangle always add up to **180\u00b0**.\n- The two given angles are **45\u00b0** and **63\u00b0**.  \n  \\(45\u00b0 + 63\u00b0 = 108\u00b0\\)\n- Subtract this sum from 180\u00b0 to get the third angle:  \n  \\(180\u00b0 \u2013 108\u00b0 = 72\u00b0\\)\n\nSo the correct measure of the third angle is **72\u00b0**, not 78\u00b0.

Let\u2019s walk through the problem together so you can see exactly how to find the missing angle.\n\n1. **Recall the triangle angle sum rule** \u2013 The three interior angles of any triangle always add up to **180\u00b0**.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Angle}_1 + \\text{Angle}_2 + \\text{Angle}_3 = 180\u00b0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Plug in the angles we know** \u2013 The problem gives us two angles: 45\u00b0 and 63\u00b0.  \n   \\[\n   45\u00b0 + 63\u00b0 + \\text{Angle}_3 = 180\u00b0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Add the known angles** \u2013  \n   \\[\n   45\u00b0 + 63\u00b0 = 108\u00b0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for the unknown angle** \u2013 Subtract the sum of the known angles from 180\u00b0.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Angle}_3 = 180\u00b0 - 108\u00b0 = 72\u00b0\n   \\]\n\nSo the third interior angle is **72\u00b0**.\n\nYou were close when you guessed 78\u00b0, but the correct value is 72\u00b0.
