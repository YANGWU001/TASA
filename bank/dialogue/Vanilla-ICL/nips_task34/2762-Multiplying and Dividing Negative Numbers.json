The previous question asked you to **multiply two signed numbers** (one positive, one negative).  \n\nThe rule you need is:\n\n- **Positive \u00d7 Negative = Negative**  \n- **Negative \u00d7 Positive = Negative**  \n\nSo if the map says \u201cmove forward\u202f5 steps\u201d (\u202f+5\u202f) and then \u201cmove backward\u202f3 steps\u201d (\u202f\u20133\u202f), the combined effect is **+5\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u20133 = \u201315**. In other words, the product is negative, and its absolute value is the product of the absolute values (5\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f15).\n\nNow that the rule is clear, let\u2019s try another problem.\n\n---\n\n### Practice Question \u2013 \u201cThe Lost Treasure Chest\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re still following the same straight\u2011line path.
