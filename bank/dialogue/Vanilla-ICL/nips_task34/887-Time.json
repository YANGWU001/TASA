The important next step is to try the problem using what you know about time.\n\n**How to solve the bus\u2011schedule problem**\n\n1. **Read the starting time:** 7\u202f:\u202f15\u202fa.m.  \n2. **Add the travel time:** 12 minutes.  \n3. **Add the minutes:**  \n\n   15\u202fmin\u202f+\u202f12\u202fmin\u202f=\u202f27\u202fmin  \n\n   Since the sum is less than 60 minutes, the hour doesn\u2019t change.  \n\n4. **Result:** 7\u202f:\u202f27\u202fa.m.\n\nSo the correct answer is **7\u202f:\u202f27\u202fa.m.**  \n\nYou didn\u2019t get the answer this time, but you now see the steps.

Since 65\u202fminutes is more than 60, **convert**: 65\u202fminutes = 1\u202fhour\u202f+\u202f5\u202fminutes.  \n4. **Add the extra hour** to the original hour (2\u202fp.m.\u202f+\u202f1\u202fhour\u202f+\u202f1\u202fhour\u202f=\u202f4\u202fp",
