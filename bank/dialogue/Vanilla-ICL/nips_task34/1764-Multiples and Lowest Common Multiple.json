The **smallest** number that appears in both lists is the LCM. In this example the LCM is **24**.  \n\n3. Because the friends both visited the park **today** (day\u202f0), the next time they will be together is 24 days from today, i.e., on day **24**.\n\nSo the correct answer to the previous problem would have been **\u201cDay\u202f24\u201d** (or \u201cin 24 days\u201d).  \n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Problem**\n\nA school runs two extracurricular clubs:\n\n- The **Art Club** meets every **9** days.  \n- The **Science Club** meets every **15** days.  \n\nBoth clubs had a joint meeting on **Monday, March\u202f1**.  \n\n**When is the next date (after March\u202f1) that the two clubs will meet on the same day?**  \n\n*Give your answer as the number of days after March\u202f1, and also state the calendar date (you may assume that March has 31 days).*\n\n---\n\n### How to Approach It\n\n1. **Find the LCM** of 9 and 15.  \n2.
