That answer is **incorrect** because the question asks for a specific number. Let\u2019s review how to find the area of a square so you can tackle the next problem with confidence.\n\n**How to find the area of a square**\n\n- A square has four equal sides.\n- The *area* is the amount of space inside the shape.\n- For a square, the area is calculated by **squaring the length of one side**:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = (\\text{side length})^2\n\\]\n\nIn the practice problem the side length was 8\u202fm, so the correct calculation would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = 8^2 = 8 \\times 8 = 64 \\text{ square meters (m}^2\\text{)}\n\\]\n\nNow you know the steps: take the side length, multiply it by itself, and write the result with the appropriate units.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**A rectangular garden has a length of 9\u202fm and a width of 4\u202fm.**\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 What is the **area** of the garden in square meters?  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 What is the **perimeter** of the garden in meters?\n\n*Hints*  \n- **Area of a rectangle** = length \u00d7 width.  \n- **Perimeter of a rectangle** = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f(length + width).\n\nGive the calculations step\u2011by\u2011step, and don\u2019t forget to include the correct units.

What is the **area** of the garden?\u201d\n\n- **Your response:**  \n  You treated the garden as a rectangle with sides 9\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202fm and gave an area of 36\u202fm\u00b2 (and omitted the \u201c\u00b2\u201d).\n\n- **Why it\u2019s incorrect:**  \n  1. The garden is a **square**, not a rectangle. All four sides are the same length (8\u202fm).  \n  2. The area of a square is found by **squaring** the side length:  \n\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area}= \\text{side} \\times \\text{side}=8\\text{\u202fm}\\times8\\text{\u202fm}=64\\text{\u202fm}^2.\n     \\]\n\n  3. The unit for area is square meters (m\u00b2), not just \u201cm\u201d.\n\n- **Correct answer:**  \n  The garden\u2019s area is **64\u202fm\u00b2**.\n\nGreat effort in writing out the formula!

Also, the side length in the problem is 8\u202fm, not 5\u202fcm. |\n\n### Where the mix\u2011up happened\n1. **Square vs. Cube** \u2013 A *square* is a 2\u2011D shape; a *cube* is a 3\u2011D shape.  \n2. **Units** \u2013 The garden\u2019s sides are given in **meters**, so the answer should be in **square meters (m\u00b2)**.  \n3. **Formula** \u2013  \n   * Area of a square:\u2003\\(A = s^2\\) (side length squared).  \n   * Volume of a cube:\u2003\\(V = s^3\\) (side length cubed).  \n\nBecause the problem asked for area, the correct operation is squaring, not cubing, and we must use the given side length of 8\u202fm.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question\n\n> **A square tabletop is 9\u202fft on each side.**  \n> a) What is the **area** of the tabletop?
