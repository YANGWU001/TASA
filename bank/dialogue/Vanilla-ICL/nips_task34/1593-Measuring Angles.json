The important thing is to keep trying and to understand the steps that lead to the answer.\n\n**How to solve the clock\u2011angle problem**\n\n1. **Understand the positions**  \n   - At **3:00** the hour hand points exactly at the 3.  \n   - The minute hand points at the 12.\n\n2. **Convert the clock positions to degrees**  \n   - A full circle is 360\u00b0, and a clock is divided into 12 numbers.  \n   - Each hour mark therefore represents \\( \\frac{360\u00b0}{12}=30\u00b0\\).  \n\n3. **Find the angle of each hand from the 12\u2011o\u2019clock position**  \n   - Minute hand: at 12 \u2192 0\u00b0.  \n   - Hour hand: at 3 \u2192 \\(3 \\times 30\u00b0 = 90\u00b0\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the difference**  \n   - Angle between the hands = \\(|90\u00b0 - 0\u00b0| = 90\u00b0\\).\n\nSo the correct answer is **90 degrees**.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question \u2013 \u201cHalf\u2011Past the Hour\u201d\n\n**Problem**\n\nThe clock now shows **6:30**.\n\n- The minute hand points at the 6.\n- The hour hand is halfway between the 6 and the 7.\n\n**What is the acute angle (the smaller angle) between the hour hand and the minute hand?**\n\n---\n\n#### Hints to help you\n\n1. **Minute hand:** Each minute mark is \\(6\u00b0\\) (because \\(360\u00b0 \u00f7 60 = 6\u00b0\\)). At 30 minutes, the minute hand is at \\(30 \\times 6\u00b0 = 180\u00b0\\) from the 12\u2011o\u2019clock position.\n\n2. **Hour hand:**  \n   - Each hour mark is 30\u00b0.  \n   - At 6:00 the hour hand would be at \\(6 \\times 30\u00b0 = 180\u00b0\\).  \n   - At 6:",

That line is the **0\u00b0 (or 360\u00b0)** reference direction.\n- The **hour hand** points exactly at the 3. On a clock face each hour mark is spaced **30\u00b0** apart because a full circle (360\u00b0) divided by 12 hours = **30\u00b0 per hour**.\n\nSo the hour hand is **3\u202f\u00d7\u202f30\u00b0 = 90\u00b0** away from the 12\u2011o\u2019clock position.  \n\nTherefore, the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand at 3:00 is **90 degrees**.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question \u2013 \u201cQuarter\u2011Past\u2011Six\u201d\n\n**Problem**\n\nImagine a clock that shows the time **6:15**.\n\n- The minute hand points at the 3 (the 15\u2011minute mark).\n- The hour hand is a little past the 6 because it has moved toward the 7 as the minutes have passed.\n\n**Question:**  \nWhat is the **smaller angle** (in degrees) between the hour hand and the minute hand at 6:15?

You read the number where the slanted ray crossed the scale.\n\n- **Where you can improve:**  \n  The protractor gives a **whole\u2011number** reading (e.g., 30\u00b0, 31\u00b0, 32\u00b0, \u2026). If the ray falls between two marks, you should decide whether to round up or down, or state the angle as \u201cbetween\u202f30\u00b0\u202fand\u202f40\u00b0\u201d.

If the ray is a little closer to 30\u00b0, the best answer would be **33\u00b0** or **34\u00b0**; if it\u2019s nearer 40\u00b0, you\u2019d say **36\u00b0** or **37\u00b0**.\n\n  **Bottom line:** Your estimate of 35\u00b0 is",

You used the protractor correctly (hole on the vertex, baseline aligned with the 0\u00b0\u2011mark).  \n  2. You looked at where the ray falls between the 30\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 marks and tried to give a whole\u2011number answer.\n\n- **Why the answer\u202f35\u00b0 is preferred:**  \n  When we read a protractor, we usually **round to the nearest whole degree**. If the ray lies exactly halfway between two marks, we could choose either, but most protractors are calibrated so that the space between 30\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 is divided into 10\u202f\u00b0\u2011increments of 1\u00b0.  \n  In the picture you measured, the ray is a little past the 35\u00b0 tick and clearly **closer to 35\u00b0 than to 34\u00b0**. That is why the standard answer is **35\u00b0** (or \u201c\u2248\u202f35\u00b0\u201d if we allow a small tolerance).  \n\n- **Why 34\u00b0 isn\u2019t the best choice:**  \n  Saying \u201c34\u00b0\u201d would be rounding **down** when the visual evidence points upward. It would be like saying a line that looks just past the halfway point between 30\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 is nearer to 30\u00b0\u2014that\u2019s not what the measurement shows.  \n\n**Bottom line:** Your reasoning about \u201cthe ray looks a little closer to the 30\u00b0 mark\u201d is understandable, but the visual cue actually places the ray **just beyond the 35\u00b0 tick**, so the most accurate whole\u2011number estimate is **35\u00b0**. Keep using the \u201cnearest whole degree\u201d rule, and you\u2019ll continue to improve.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question\n\n### Measuring an Angle with a Pro",
