In mathematical terms, we need the **Highest Common Factor (HCF)** \u2013 also called the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) \u2013 of the two numbers of cupcakes (48 and 60).  \n\n- The HCF tells us the biggest \u201cgroup size\u201d that can divide **both** numbers evenly.  \n- Once we know that group size, we can also find how many trays of each flavor will be needed.\n\n**How to find the HCF (quick reminder)**  \n\n1. **List the factors** of each number, or  \n2. Use the **prime\u2011factorisation** method, or  \n3. Apply the **Euclidean algorithm** (repeated division).\n\nFor example, using prime factorisation:  \n\n- 48 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 = 2\u2074\u202f\u00b7\u202f3\u00b9  \n- 60 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 = 2\u00b2\u202f\u00b7\u202f3\u00b9\u202f\u00b7\u202f5\u00b9  \n\nTake the lowest power of each common prime:  \n\n- 2 appears in both \u2192 use 2\u00b2 (the smaller exponent) = 4  \n- 3 appears in both \u2192 use 3\u00b9 = 3  \n\nMultiply the common parts: 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 = **12**.  \n\nSo the HCF of 48 and 60 is **12**. That means the baker can make trays that hold **12 cupcakes each** without any leftovers.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Problem**\n\nA gardener has two types of flower seeds:\n\n- 84 rose seeds  \n- 120 tulip seeds  \n\nShe wants to plant the seeds in **identical small pots**, putting the same number of seeds in each pot, and she",

Making a guess, listing what you do know, or writing down the steps you think might help lets you see where the gaps are and gives us a place to start correcting them.
