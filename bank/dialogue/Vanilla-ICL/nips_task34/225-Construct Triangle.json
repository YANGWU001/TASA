Using **only** these tools, construct triangle **ABC** that satisfies the following conditions:\n\n- **AB = 6\u202fcm**\n- **AC = 8\u202fcm**\n- **\u2220BAC = 60\u00b0**\n\n*Imagine you are designing a triangular garden plot where the two sides meeting at the entrance (point\u202fA) must be 6\u202fcm and 8\u202fcm long, and the angle between them must be exactly 60\u00b0. Draw the garden\u2019s shape accurately on your paper.*\n\n---\n\n### What you need to do\n1. **Draw the base side AB** (or AC) of the required length.\n2. **Create the 60\u00b0 angle** at the appropriate endpoint.\n3. **Mark the second side** of the required length using the compass.\n4. **Complete the triangle** by connecting the points.\n\n---\n\n### How you\u2019ll show your work\n- Label the three vertices **A**, **B**, and **C** clearly.\n- Indicate each construction step (e.g., \u201cdraw a 60\u00b0 angle at A,\u201d \u201cset the compass to 8\u202fcm,\u201d etc.).\n- Make sure the final figure is a clean, closed triangle that meets all three conditions.\n\nWhen you\u2019re finished, you\u2019ll have a perfectly constructed triangle ready for your garden plan!
