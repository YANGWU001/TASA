He decides to earn money in two ways:  \n> 1. He does a chore each day that pays **$3**. He plans to do \u2026  \n\nTo write an expression we need **two pieces of information**:\n\n1. **How many days** he will do the $3 chore.  \n2. The **second way** he earns money (e.g., a weekly allowance, a one\u2011time job, etc.) and how many times it occurs.\n\nAn expression will combine those two amounts, typically using multiplication for \u201ceach day\u201d or \u201ceach week\u201d and addition to total the two sources of money. For example, if Liam does the chore for **5 days** and also receives a **$10** bonus, the expression would be:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 5 \\;+\\; 10\n\\]\n\nSince the problem statement was cut off, we can\u2019t finish the exact expression yet. When you see the full scenario, identify:\n\n- The **rate** (how much each unit of time or each chore pays)  \n- The **quantity** (how many times that rate occurs)  \n- Any **additional fixed amounts**  \n\nThen combine them with multiplication and addition (or subtraction, if something is taken away).\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question \u2013 Writing an Expression\n\n**Scenario:**  \n\nMaya is planning a school fundraiser.
