The important thing is to try breaking the problem into smaller parts and work through the steps one at a time.  \n\nWhen you feel ready, you can:\n\n1. **Identify any brackets** and solve the inside first.  \n2. **Look for indices (exponents)** and evaluate them next.  \n3. **Do all division and multiplication** from left\u2011to\u2011right.  \n4. **Finish with addition and subtraction** from left\u2011to\u2011right.\n\nLet\u2019s practice that process together with a new problem.\n\n---\n\n## Practice Question \u2013 \u201cThe Magic Potion\u201d \ud83e\uddea\n\nYou are mixing a magical potion.

You can always check your work afterward and learn from any mistakes.
