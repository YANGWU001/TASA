That\u2019s okay \u2013 the first step in learning is recognizing when you need help. Let\u2019s walk through how to solve the question so you can see the process for yourself.\n\n**How to Find the Time Emily Should Leave**\n\n1. **Identify the target time** \u2013 Emily\u2019s class starts at **9:15\u202fAM**.  \n2. **Know the travel time** \u2013 She needs **45\u202fminutes** to walk to school.  \n3. **Work backward** \u2013 To arrive exactly at 9:15\u202fAM, she must leave 45 minutes *earlier*.\n\n   - Subtract 45 minutes from 9:15\u202fAM.  \n   - 9:15\u202fAM \u2013 15\u202fminutes = **9:00\u202fAM**.  \n   - We still need to subtract the remaining 30\u202fminutes: 9:00\u202fAM \u2013 30\u202fminutes = **8:30\u202fAM**.\n\n4. **Answer** \u2013 Emily should leave her house at **8:30\u202fAM**.\n\nNow you see the steps: start with the arrival time, subtract the travel minutes, and you get the departure time.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Question:**  \nCarlos has a soccer practice that begins at **4:20\u202fPM**. He lives 1 hour and 20 minutes away from the field.  \n\n**What time should Carlos leave his house so he arrives right at the start of practice?**\n\n**Hints to help you:**\n- Write the start time (4:20\u202fPM) on paper.\n- Subtract the hours first, then the minutes, or combine them into 80 minutes and subtract all at once.\n- Remember that when you subtract minutes and go below 0, you need to \"borrow\" an hour (e.g., 4:20\u202fPM \u2013 30\u202fminutes = 3:50\u202fPM).\n\nGive it a try, and let me know what answer you get!

She needs **45\u202fminutes** to walk from her home to school. What time should Emily leave her house so she arrives right at the start of class?*\n\nTo answer this we need to **work backward** from the class start time, subtracting the travel time.\n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step solution**\n\n1. **Write the start time**: 9:15\u202fAM.  \n2. **Subtract the walk time** (45\u202fminutes).  \n   - Subtract 15\u202fminutes first: 9:15\u202fAM\u202f\u2212\u202f15\u202fmin\u202f=\u202f9:00\u202fAM.  \n   - Then subtract the remaining 30\u202fminutes: 9:00\u202fAM\u202f\u2212\u202f30\u202fmin\u202f=\u202f8:30\u202fAM.  \n\nSo Emily should **leave at 8:30\u202fAM** to arrive exactly at 9:15\u202fAM.\n\n**Why the earlier answer was off**\n\n- The name \u201cCarlos\u201d and the time \u201c2:40\u202fPM\u201d do not appear in the problem, so they cannot be the correct answer.  \n- The key operation is **subtraction of minutes** from a given time, not addition or unrelated guessing.\n\nGreat effort in trying to think through the problem!
