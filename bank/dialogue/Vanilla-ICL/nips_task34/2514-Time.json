Let\u2019s work through the reasoning together so you can see how to get the answer on your own.\n\n**Problem recap**\n\n> Emma\u2019s piano lesson starts at **3:15\u202fPM**. She needs **45\u202fminutes** to finish her homework **before** she can leave for the lesson.  \n> What time must Emma finish her homework (i.e., what time should she start getting ready) so that she can be on time for the lesson?\n\n**How to solve it**\n\n1. The lesson time (3:15\u202fPM) is the **deadline**.  \n2. Emma must finish her homework **45 minutes earlier** than that deadline.  \n3. To find the earlier time, **subtract** 45 minutes from 3:15\u202fPM.\n\n   - Subtract 15 minutes first: 3:15\u202fPM\u202f\u2013\u202f15\u202fmin\u202f=\u202f3:00\u202fPM.  \n   - You still need to subtract another 30 minutes: 3:00\u202fPM\u202f\u2013\u202f30\u202fmin\u202f=\u202f2:30\u202fPM.\n\nSo the correct answer is **2:30\u202fPM**.\n\nYou were close when you guessed 3:45\u202fPM, but that would be **after** the lesson starts, not before it.
