Good estimates are based on:\n   - **Relative size** (a bag of popcorn is bigger than a single cookie).  \n   - **Typical quantities** you might see in a snack box or on a shelf.  \n   - **Any numbers given in the problem** (e.g., \u201cabout twice as many gummies as cookies\u201d).  \n\n   Without using any of those clues, the answer can\u2019t be judged correct.\n\n3. **Checking Consistency** \u2013 Often the problem includes a relationship between the amounts (e.g., \u201cThere are three times as many popcorn bags as cookie packs\u201d).
