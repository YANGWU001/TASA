For example, the multiples of 4 are 4,\u202f8,\u202f12,\u202f16,\u2026 |\n| **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** | The smallest positive number that is a multiple of **both** numbers.  It is the \u201cfirst time\u201d the two counting cycles line up.  You can find it by: <br>1\ufe0f\u20e3 List a few multiples of each number and look for the smallest common one, **or** <br>2\ufe0f\u20e3 Use prime\u2011factorization (multiply the highest power of each prime that appears). |\n\nIf you\u2019d like, we can try a quick \u201clist\u2011the\u2011multiples\u201d example together before moving on to a new question.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Problem:**  \nTwo friends are practicing clapping patterns.  \n\n- Maya claps every **6 seconds**.  \n- Liam claps every **8 seconds**.\n\n**a)** List the first five multiples of 6 and the first five multiples of 8.  \n\n**b)** What is the **least common multiple (LCM)** of 6 and 8?

Identify the two (or more) numbers whose loops we\u2019re trying to sync.  \n2. List a few multiples of each number or use prime\u2011factorization.  \n3. Find the smallest number that appears in both lists (or combine the highest powers of each prime factor).  \n\nEven if you\u2019re unsure, trying one of those steps gives us a clue about where you\u2019re getting stuck, and it helps you practice the process.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcda Let\u2019s Try Another Problem\n\n**Practice Question**\n\n*Liam is watering two garden beds.

After how many minutes will they both finish a whole number of cycles at the same moment again?*\n\n#### Steps to Solve (you can follow them, skip any you already know)\n\n1. **Write the first few multiples** of each cycle length.  \n   - Multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, \u2026  \n   - Multiples of 8: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, \u2026\n2. **Look for the smallest number that appears in both lists**.
