Let\u2019s review the steps you would use for the baker problem, and then we\u2019ll try a new one together.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Review: How to Find the HCF\n\n1. **List the factors of each number** (or use prime\u2011factorisation \u2013 whichever you prefer).  \n2. **Identify the common factors** that appear in both lists.  \n3. **Pick the greatest** of those common factors \u2013 that\u2019s the HCF.\n\n#### Example (the baker problem)\n\n- Numbers: **48** and **60**  \n- Factors of 48: 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f8,\u202f12,\u202f16,\u202f24,\u202f48  \n- Factors of 60: 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f5,\u202f6,\u202f10,\u202f12,\u202f15,\u202f20,\u202f30,\u202f60  \n\n**Common factors:** 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f12  \n**Greatest common factor:** **12**\n\nSo the baker could put **12 cookies on each identical tray** without any leftovers. (If you used the prime\u2011factor method, you\u2019d see that 48\u202f=\u202f2\u00b3\u00b73 and 60\u202f=\u202f2\u00b2\u00b73\u00b75, so the shared primes are 2\u00b2\u00b73\u202f=\u202f12.)\n\n---\n\n### Let\u2019s Practice Again\n\nNow that the steps are fresh in your mind, try this new problem.\n\n---\n\n#### Practice Question\n\nA gardener has two rows of plants.
