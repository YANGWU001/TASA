Draw a line segment **AB** that is 6\u202fcm long.  \n2. At point **A**, use the protractor to mark an angle of **45\u00b0** on the side of the line where the triangle will be built.  \n3. From point **A**, draw a ray that makes the 45\u00b0 angle with **AB**.  \n4. Set your compass to a radius of **8\u202fcm**, place the point on **A**, and draw an arc that cuts the ray you just drew.  \n5. Label the intersection of the arc and the ray as **C**.  \n6.

The important thing is to break the problem into smaller, manageable steps and to practice each tool (ruler, compass, protractor) one at a time.\n\n**Why the question is challenging**\n\n1. **Multiple pieces of information** \u2013 you have two side lengths (AB\u202f=\u202f6\u202fcm, AC\u202f=\u202f8\u202fcm) *and* an angle at A (\u2220BAC).  \n2. **Order matters** \u2013 you must place the given side lengths and the angle in the correct geometric relationship before drawing the third side.  \n3. **Tool coordination** \u2013 a compass is used to transfer a length, a protractor to set an angle, and a ruler to draw straight lines. Getting comfortable with each tool separately will make the whole construction smoother.\n\n**A quick \u201ccheat\u2011sheet\u201d for this type of problem**\n\n1. **Draw the base** \u2013 Start by drawing one of the known sides (e.g., AB = 6\u202fcm).  \n2. **Set the given angle** \u2013 At point A, use the protractor to mark the required angle \u2220BAC.  \n3. **Transfer the second side length** \u2013 From A, draw an arc with radius AC = 8\u202fcm that intersects the ray you just created in step\u202f2. The intersection point will be C.  \n4. **Complete the triangle** \u2013 Connect points B and C with a straight line.\n\nIf you follow those four steps, you\u2019ll end up with the required triangle. Try doing it on paper with a ruler, compass, and protractor; you\u2019ll see how the pieces fit together.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question\n\n**Goal:** Strengthen your",
