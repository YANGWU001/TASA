That\u2019s perfectly okay\u2014everyone starts somewhere!  \n\nThe HCF (also called the Greatest Common Divisor, GCD) of two numbers is the **largest whole number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder**.  \n\nA common way to find it is:\n\n1. **List the factors** of each number (or use prime\u2011factorisation).  \n2. **Identify the factors they have in common.**  \n3. **Pick the greatest one** \u2013 that\u2019s the HCF.\n\nFor example, with 36 and 54:\n\n- Factors of 36: 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f12,\u202f18,\u202f36  \n- Factors of 54: 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f18,\u202f27,\u202f54  \n\nCommon factors: 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f18 \u2192 the largest is **18**, so HCF(36,\u202f54)\u202f=\u202f18.\n\nNow that you\u2019ve seen the process, let\u2019s try another one.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Find the Highest Common Factor (HCF) of 48 and 64.**\n\n**Hints to guide you**\n\n1. **List the factors** of each number (you don\u2019t need to list every factor\u2014just keep going until you see a pattern).  \n2. **Or** use prime factorisation:  \n   - Write each number as a product of prime numbers.  \n   - Identify the primes they share and multiply those common primes together.  \n3.
