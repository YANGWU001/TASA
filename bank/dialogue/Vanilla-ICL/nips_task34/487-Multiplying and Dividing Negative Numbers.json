The goal of the last problem was to see whether you could translate the word problem into a multiplication expression and then evaluate it.  \n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, try to think about these two ideas:\n\n1. **Multiplying a negative by a negative gives a positive.**  \n   \\(-a \\times -b = +ab\\)\n\n2. **Multiplying a positive by a negative (or vice\u2011versa) gives a negative.**  \n   \\(a \\times -b = -ab\\)\n\nIn the trap example, \u201c\u20113 traps\u201d means we are **subtracting** three traps, which is the same as multiplying by \\(-3\\). The health change per trap is \\(-5\\). So the expression to evaluate is \\((-5) \\times (-3)\\). Using rule\u202f1, the product is \\(+15\\) (the character actually **gains** 15 health points).\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n> A submarine can descend **\u20118 meters** for each minute it runs its ballast pumps.  \n> If the captain runs the pumps for **\u20114 minutes** (i.e., the captain stops the pumps for 4 minutes and the submarine rises instead), how many meters does the submarine\u2019s depth change?\n\n**Steps to solve:**\n1.

Write the product and interpret what the sign means for the submarine\u2019s movement.\n\nGive it a try, and let me know what you get!
