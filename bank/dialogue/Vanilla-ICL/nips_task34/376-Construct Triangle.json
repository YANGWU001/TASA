Even if you are unsure of the exact steps, the goal is to demonstrate that you understand the basic ideas behind a geometric construction (e.g., drawing a line segment of a given length, using a compass to copy lengths, creating intersecting arcs, etc.).  \n\n**Why this matters**\n\n- In a construction problem, the *process* is the answer.  \n- Showing any attempt\u2014 even a partial one\u2014 lets the tutor see where your thinking is getting stuck and give targeted help.  \n- \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d tells us you need a clearer, step\u2011by\u2011step scaffold to get started.\n\n**How to improve**\n\n1. **Identify the given data** \u2013 you know one side length (AB\u202f=\u202f7\u202fcm) and you will be given two other conditions (usually another side length or an angle).  \n2. **Decide what you can draw directly** \u2013 a line segment of 7\u202fcm can be drawn with a ruler (or by marking off 7\u202fcm with a compass).  \n3. **Think about the next piece of information** \u2013 if you are told, for example, that side AC = 5\u202fcm, you can use the compass to copy that length from point A.  \n4. **Use intersecting arcs** \u2013 the point where two arcs intersect will give you a vertex that satisfies both length conditions.  \n5. **Connect the dots** \u2013 draw the remaining sides with the straight\u2011edge.\n\nWhen you feel stuck, try to write down *what you can do first* (e.g., \u201cdraw AB = 7\u202fcm\u201d), then *what you need to find next* (e.g., \u201clocate point C so that AC = 5\u202fcm and BC = 6\u202fcm\u201d).\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question\n\n**Goal:** Practice the basic \u201ccopy\u2011a\u2011length",

Even if you are unsure how to begin, the appropriate response is to try a first step (e.g., draw a given segment, mark an angle, or state the construction you would attempt). Saying \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d shows that you haven\u2019t engaged with the construction process, which is exactly what we want you to practice.\n\n**Why this matters**\n\n- Geometry constructions are procedural: you start with the given data, then use a sequence of allowed moves (draw a line, draw a circle, find intersections) to obtain the required figure.  \n- Demonstrating *any* attempt\u2014correct or not\u2014gives the tutor information about where your reasoning breaks down, so you can receive targeted help.  \n- \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d gives no information, so we can\u2019t pinpoint the concept that needs reinforcement.\n\n**How to improve**\n\n1. **Identify the given elements.** Write down exactly what the problem provides (e.g., a side length, an angle, a point).  \n2. **Recall the basic construction tools.** You can:  \n   - Draw a straight line through two points.  \n   - Draw a circle with a given center and radius.  \n   - Mark the intersection of a line and a circle (or two circles).  \n3. **Plan a first move.** Choose the simplest operation that uses one piece of given data. For instance, if a side length AB = 6\u202fcm is given, the first step is to draw segment AB of that length.  \n4. **Write the step in words.** Even if you are not sure what comes next, stating \u201cDraw segment AB of length 6\u202fcm\u201d shows you understand the starting point",
