Since the question asked you to identify the three properties that must hold for **every** rhombus, leaving it blank is counted as an incorrect response.\u202fDon\u2019t worry\u2014this is a great opportunity to review the key ideas.\n\n**Why the three statements are important**\n\nA rhombus is a special type of parallelogram, so it inherits all parallelogram properties (opposite sides are parallel, opposite angles are equal, diagonals bisect each other, etc.). In addition, because **all four sides are congruent**, a rhombus also has extra consequences (e.g., its diagonals are perpendicular). When you see a list of statements, ask yourself:\n\n1. Does the statement follow directly from \u201call sides are equal\u201d **or** from the fact that a rhombus is a parallelogram?  \n2. Could you draw a rhombus where the statement is false? If you can, the statement is **not** always true.\n\nKeeping these two checks in mind will help you pick the correct three items next time.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question \u2013 Properties of a **Rectangle**\n\nA rectangle is a quadrilateral with **four right angles**. Using this definition, which **two** statements below are always true for *any* rectangle? (Select all that apply.)\n\nA. Opposite sides are congruent.  \nB. All four sides are congruent.  \nC. The diagonals are equal in length.  \nD. The diagonals are perpendicular.  \nE. One pair of opposite sides is parallel.\n\n**Please write the letters of the statements you think are always true (e.g., \u201cA, C\u201d).**  \n\nIf you\u2019d like a hint before answering, just let me know!",

Even if you are unsure, a response that selects none of the options does not demonstrate the required understanding.\n\n- **Why it matters:** A rhombus has several definitive properties that hold for **every** rhombus, no matter how it is drawn.  Recognizing those properties is the goal of this exercise.  When you are stuck, try to recall the definition (\u201call four sides are congruent\u201d) and think about what else must follow from that definition (e.g., relationships of opposite sides, angles, diagonals).\n\n- **Next steps:**  \n  1. Review the basic definition of a rhombus and the properties that follow from \u201call sides equal.\u201d  \n  2. Pay special attention to how a rhombus relates to other quadrilaterals (parallelogram, rectangle, kite).  \n  3. When you see a list of statements, eliminate any that are **not** guaranteed for every rhombus (e.g., statements about right angles, equal diagonals, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question \u2013 Building on What You Know\n\n**Question:**  \nA **parallelogram** is a quadrilateral with both pairs of opposite sides parallel.
