Write each number as a product of primes.<br>2. For each prime, take the highest exponent that appears.<br>3. Multiply those together. |\n| **Listing multiples** | 1. Write a few multiples of each number.<br>2. Find the first number that appears in *both* lists. |\n| **Division (ladder) method** | 1. Write the numbers side\u2011by\u2011side.<br>2. Divide by any common factor until none remain.<br>3. Multiply the divisors together \u2013 that product is the LCM. |\n\nYou\u2019re doing fine; the next step is simply to try the process yourself.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question\n\n**Find the least common multiple of 15 and\u202f20.**\n\n### How to approach it (you can choose any method)\n\n1. **Prime\u2011factor method**  \n   * 15 = 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5  \n   * 20 = 2\u00b2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5  \n   * Take the highest power of each prime: 2\u00b2, 3\u00b9, 5\u00b9 \u2192 LCM = 2\u00b2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 = **60**",
