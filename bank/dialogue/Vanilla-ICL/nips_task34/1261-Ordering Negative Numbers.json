The deeper the clue, the **more negative** the number.\n\nBelow are the depths (in meters) of four clues:\n\n- Clue\u202fA: **\u20113** meters  \n- Clue\u202fB: **\u20118** meters  \n- Clue\u202fC: **\u20111** meters  \n- Clue\u202fD: **\u20115** meters  \n\n**Task:** List the clues from the **shallowest** (closest to the surface) to the **deepest** (farther below the surface). Write the letters in order (e.g.,\u202fA, B, C, D). \n\n*Remember: on a number line, numbers that are **greater** (less negative) are higher up, and numbers that are **smaller** (more negative) are lower down.*",

That\u2019s okay \u2013 recognizing that you need more practice is the first step!  \n\nWhen we **order negative numbers**, we remember two key ideas:\n\n1. **More negative\u202f=\u202fsmaller**.  \n   For example, \u20138 is **less than** \u20133 because \u20138 is farther to the left on the number line.\n\n2. **The usual \u201cgreater\u2011than/less\u2011than\u201d symbols still work**.  \n   Write the numbers from the smallest (most negative) on the left to the largest (closest to zero) on the right.\n\nLet\u2019s try another problem together.\n\n---\n\n### Practice Question \u2013 Ordering Negative Numbers\n\nYou are arranging three treasure\u2011chest clues that are buried at depths (in meters) below ground:\n\n- Clue\u202fA: \u201312\u202fm  \n- Clue\u202fB: \u20135\u202fm  \n- Clue\u202fC: \u20139\u202fm  \n\n**Task:** List the clues from the shallowest (closest to the surface) to the deepest (farther below the surface). Write the answer as a sequence of the letters A, B, C.\n\n*Hint:* On a number line, the value that is **closest to zero** is the shallowest, and the value that is **most negative** is the deepest.\n\n---\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, type the ordered letters (e.g., \u201cB\u202fC\u202fA\u201d).

The one that sits farthest left is the **least**, and the one farthest right is the **greatest**.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Order the following three negative numbers from **least (smallest) to greatest (largest)**:**\n\n\\[\n-4,\\;\\; -11,\\;\\; -7\n\\]\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. Visualize a number line or write the numbers in order.  \n2. Remember: the number that is **more negative** (farther left) is the **smaller** value.  \n3. Write the ordered list, separating the numbers with commas.\n\n**Your answer (write the ordered list):** \n\n--- \n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, type the ordered sequence (for example, \u201c\u201112, \u20119, \u20113\u201d).
