The left side of the triangle matches the right side, and the left side of the rectangle matches the right side. |\n| **Horizontal line B** | If you fold the shape along the horizontal line drawn through the middle of the rectangle, the **top half** (the triangle\u202f+\u202fupper part of the rectangle) does **not** match the **bottom half** (the lower part of the rectangle). The triangle has no counterpart below the line, so the halves are not identical. |\n| **Correct line of symmetry** | The shape is symmetric **vertically** \u2013 a line that runs **down the middle**, from the top of the triangle straight through the center of the rectangle to the bottom. When you reflect the shape across this vertical line, the left side lines up perfectly with the right side. |\n\nSo the correct answer would be **line\u202fA \u2013 the vertical line through the centre of the shape**.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\nBelow is a new figure.

Let\u2019s revisit the last question so the idea sticks.\n\nThe shape we looked at was a **rectangle with a right\u2011triangle attached to one side** (imagine a house\u2011shape where the \u201croof\u201d is only on the left).  \n\n- A **line of symmetry** must cut the figure into two pieces that are **exactly the same** when one piece is folded over the line.  \n- The **horizontal line B** you mentioned does split the rectangle in half, but it does **not** do the same for the triangle: the triangle is only on the left side, so when you fold along the horizontal line the triangle would end up on the opposite side where there is no matching triangle.  \n- Because the two halves are not identical, line\u202fB is **not** a line of symmetry.\n\nThe correct line of symmetry for that shape is the **vertical line that runs down the middle of the rectangle and also bisects the triangle** (let\u2019s call it line\u202fA).

To decide how many lines of symmetry a shape has, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Visualise a fold.** Imagine drawing a straight line through the shape. If you can flip one side over the line and every point lands on a matching point on the other side, that line is a symmetry line.  \n2. **Test all plausible directions.** Common candidates are vertical, horizontal, and diagonal lines that pass through vertices or mid\u2011points of sides.  \n3. **Count the successful lines.** Some shapes have none, some have one, and regular polygons can have many (e.g., a square has 4).\n\nWhen you\u2019re not sure, try *drawing* the shape on paper and actually folding it (or using a mirror) to see which lines work.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Identify the number of lines of symmetry for the shape described below.**  \n*(You may sketch the shape on a piece of paper to help you.)*\n\n> **Shape:** A right\u2011angled triangle where the two legs are of equal length (an isosceles right triangle).

Because the question asks you to choose the correct number (or the correct statement) about the lines of symmetry, we can\u2019t evaluate whether the idea is right or wrong.\n\n**Why a complete answer matters**\n\n- A shape can have **0, 1, 2, 3, \u2026** lines of symmetry.  \n- To answer correctly you need to **state the exact number** (or say \u201cnone\u201d) **and, if possible, describe the line(s)** (e.g., \u201cthe vertical line through the middle,\u201d \u201cthe diagonal from the top\u2011left to bottom\u2011right,\u201d etc.).  \n- An incomplete answer means you missed the chance to demonstrate your understanding, even if you were on the right track.\n\n**Next steps to improve**\n\n1.
